The most venerable and traditionally most powerful has its sources in art history and in an archaeological tradition committed to descrip- tion and classification. Its products include many of the classic publications in Maya studies, includ- ing those of Maudslay (1889-1902), Morley (1920, 1935, 1937-38), Spinden (1913), and Thompson (1950, 1962). Beginning modestly in the 1950s and swelling to a powerful tributary in its own right in the 1960s is another current: be- havioral anthropology and human ecology. Both have been considerably commingled in their prac- titioners and in their goals, especially in terms of cultural-historical reconstruction. Both have de- pended heavily on many of the same resources, particularly ethnohistoric accounts and ethno- graphic studies of recent Maya and other Meso- american populations. The fruitful confluence of these two streams has produced spectacular in- sights into the nature of ancient Maya society that would have astounded Maudslay or Morley, as well as a whole new generation of stimulating debates. The data and interpretations in this book, which focus on the House of the Bacabs at Copan and its context, are recent products of this interaction. As specialists engaged in a common enterprise - the retrieval of the Maya past - we must con- stantly bear in mind the dichotomous nature of our scholastic origins, especially at this juncture of Maya studies when extremes of specialization pro- duce not only sophisticated insights but also, per- haps unavoidably, narrow viewpoints. Part of the danger lies in the potentially divergent goals of the two scholarly currents. On the one hand, there is the continuing and vigorous traditional study of Maya elite culture, particularly as embodied in monumental architecture, astronomy, art, and in- scriptions. Apart from cultural-historical con- cerns, its primary goal is reconstructing the details of Maya elite culture, particularly its ritual and sociopolitical dimensions, intricacies of specific dy- nastic sequences, and, on a higher level, recover- ing what we might call the elite Maya world view. On the other is the emphasis on reconstructing the larger behavioral systems and institutions the Maya devised for themselves and the social, politi- cal, economic, and demographic processes associ- ated with their growth and decline. A related dan- ger is that short-term shifts in our enthusiasm for one or another of these sets of broad goals distract scholars from the necessary integrative effort needed to make sense out of either of them. We are currently witnessing a decided shift back toward the study of Maya elite culture, largely as a result of recent breakthroughs in un- derstanding the content of Classic Maya inscrip- tions and iconography. This shift is most notably exemplified by the huge success of the recent Blood of Kings volume (Scheie and Miller 1986) and its associated exhibition. In the introduction to this book, Michael Coe, himself long a student of Maya art, characterizes the study of Maya glyphs and iconography as the "cutting edge" of Maya scholarship. In making this claim, Coe is both correct and incorrect. Such studies certainly constitute a cutting edge if by this he means that they are producing very sophisticated and detailed 1</page><page sequence="6">insights into the nature of elite Maya society, its ideological correlates, and specific lines of rulers, and that progress is much more rapidly being made in these endeavors than, say, in the recon- struction of Maya settlement systems or subsis- tence practices. If in addition, as his comment seems to suggest, he means that decoding epigra- phy and iconography will provide us with the keys to a broad understanding of Maya behavior and institutions, he is, in my opinion, wrong. Ironically, the rapid breakthroughs in our deci- pherment of texts, whether texts are conceived of as inscriptions, iconography, or configurations of architectural or other features, show ever more clearly that the Maya elite were interested in con- veying a limited and specialized dimension of in- formation, now fragmented by the vagaries of preservation and recovery. Certainly, as Miller and Scheie and their col- leagues have abundantly documented, our capac- ity to decode the elite Maya world view is impres- sive. So too are the implications derived from art and iconography concerning systemic aspects of elite behavior and structure, especially relating to politics and the imagery of power. But even here, unless the totally unexpected crops up, our find- ings will be limited. We will be able to recon- struct dynastic sequences and processes of elite interaction such as intermarriage, visitations, and warfare. But apparently no scribes or artists set down information that will inform us about the size of the territory or population ruled by a Maya king, his precise relationships with his sub- jects, the amounts and variety of goods obtained from them that fill his storehouses and the modes of their collection, or mechanisms of interregional economic exchange (even on the elite level). Al- most entirely lacking are data on the nature of family and household structure, the range of sta- ple crops and dominant systems of cultivation, or any other of the myriad, commonplace things that we need to know to provide a comprehen- sive picture of the ancient Maya and about which, not coincidently, we argue endlessly. Eventually we may well have king lists for the Maya Low- lands comparable to those from ancient Sumer or Predynastic and Old Kingdom Egypt. Indeed, such Maya accounts may be even more reliable than their Old World counterparts because they are usually drawn from primary texts rather than much later (often error-filled and dubious) tran- scriptions, which is generally the case in Mesopo- tamia and Egypt. But we will seemingly never have anything like the Sumerian archive accounts of economic transactions or the detailed tomb paintings of Egypt that record vivid images not only of the elite but of the mundane world as well. What we seem to be getting is the elite perspec- tive pure and simple, and an incomplete perspec- tive at best, even on this level. To be sure, we may make assumptions about other aspects of Maya society based on the public "face" that rul- ers and elites presented, or alternatively try to trace the evolution of elite symbols and behavior out of more fundamental aspects of Maya life (and here we may certainly learn much about Maya language), but there is a limit to how far these assumptions can proceed without indepen- dent confirmation. In this regard it would be well if, as Mayanists, we remember how pathetically limited are our insights derived from texts for Early Dynastic Sumer or Old Kingdom Egypt and the degree to which large-scale archaeology is necessary to supplement historical documents to reconstruct these prehistoric cultures. In thus characterizing the results to date of the traditional scheme of scholarship, my intention is in no way to demean it, but simply to point out its limitations and the degree to which it must be integrated with additional data derived from the more recent anthropological/behavioral/proces- sual research approach in order to produce a mean- ingful reconstruction of general patterns of Maya culture. William T. Sanders, whose work is associ- ated with the latter research orientation (as exem- plified in Chapter 5), has remarked to me that the single paper in Maya archaeology he would most like to have written is Tatiana Proskouriakoffs (i960) breakthrough discussion of the implications of the Piedras Negras inscriptions. This does not betray Sanders as a closet epigrapher/icono- grapher. Apart from his admiration of the method- ological ingenuity Proskouriakoff exhibited, his en- 2</page><page sequence="7">thusiasm derives from the wider implications of her study, which broke the mold of the old "priest/intellectual/theocrat" conception of Maya kingship (especially as propounded by J. E. S. Thompson) and implied that the Maya elite con- ducted themselves very much like rulers in other early complex societies. Once the mystique of the Maya as somehow unique in organizational terms had thus been undermined, the efficacy of a com- parative, behavioral, anthropological approach was strengthened, and our general understanding was considerably advanced. If the cutting edge of epigraphic and icono- graphic studies slices quickly and accurately but not deeply, as I have maintained, then the standard methods of the behavioral/ecological/processual approach, such as surface survey, test-pitting, and large-scale horizontal excavations, function more like blunt instruments. They are very powerful, but they are also very slow, even tedious, and com- paratively costly. Certainly they are seldom as immediately rewarding - or as dramatic - as epi- graphic/iconographic breakthroughs. They pro- vide general structural insights but seldom much fine-grained detail, and their content is anony- mous, lacking the glamorous glimpses of once- living individual ancient actors, with personal names and life histories, that the texts yield. Inevi- tably, these approaches are complementary, all the more so because the same research efforts often produce the raw stuff informing both of them. In a very real sense, this book represents a plea to Maya scholars of all kinds to remember that we must pull in tandem if we are to make sense out of the Maya past. The research conducted at Copan over the past century exemplifies the traditions of Maya scholar- ship discussed above. The earliest phases of this research, dominated by Maudslay and Morley, the Peabody Museum and the Carnegie Institu- tion, focused on the recording and analysis of in- scriptions and sculpture and the excavation and restoration of monumental architecture at the Main Group at Copan (Fig. i). A more recent phase of research was initiated in 1975, fittingly under the direction of Gordon Willey, whose ca- reer has been conspicuous for its integration of both currents of Maya studies. Willey's project began the systematic mapping and excavation of sites outside the Main Group at Copan in order to understand the larger settlement system, an effort continued by Claude Baudez after he assumed di- rectorship of the project in 1977. Both also contin- ued work in the Main Group, which yielded not only new inscriptions and sculpture but also a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of such materials recovered much earlier. In 1980, at the invitation of the Honduran Gov- ernment, William T. Sanders and I began Phase II of the Copan Archaeological Project, and we have codirected the project since then. The Phase II research had as its dominant goal the extensive excavation of a large sample of archaeological complexes - presumably the remains of ancient households - outside the Main Group. Because these exhibited great variation in size and com- plexity, we felt, as had Willey before us, that extensive excavation of a wide range of them would help to solve important issues concerning functions of Maya architectural complexes and the sociopolitical structure of Classic Maya soci- ety. Our work included, in good Copan tradi- tion, the partial excavation of what we think is an elite young mens' dormitory in the Main Group. In addition, we conducted an extensive rural sur- face survey and test-pitting program, initiated a series of studies of the natural environment and ethnographic patterns (particularly land use), and also an ambitious program of obsidian hydration dating to provide much-needed chronological con- trols. This research, along with the accompany- ing extensive restoration, was carried out with the permission and financial support of the Insti- tuto Hondureno de Antropologia e Historia (IHAH). Additional generous funding came from the National Science Foundation and the Wenner- Gren Foundation. Most of our major excavations focused on the Las Sepulturas urban enclave, newly mapped by Willey and his associates, lying just to the north and east of the Main Group. This was clearly an area of probable elite residence, and Group 9N-8, the largest architectural complex at Las Sepulturas, was virtually completely excavated during 1980- 3</page><page sequence="8">84. One of our principal discoveries was the elite structure 9N-82 center, which we now call the House of the Bacabs for reasons that will become clear later. The House of the Bacabs dominates Group 9N-8 and was the largest and most heavily embellished building excavated outside the Copan Main Group. It yielded an impressive corpus of sculpture as well as a lengthy inscription. The in- tent of this volume is to evaluate the significance of the House of the Bacabs by integrating the perspec- tives of the epigraphic/iconographic approach and the behavioral/anthropological one. The following chapters present a synthesis of information and interpretation concerning the House of the Bacabs, which can be read on several levels: as description of an elite structure and its wider context, as an exercise in architectural exca- vation and restoration, as an example of the intrica- cies of iconographic and epigraphic reconstruction and interpretation, and finally, as an attempt to develop models for understanding important as- pects of Classic Maya social and political life. Most of the discussion relates to the Late Classic occupa- tion at Copan between about a.d. 700 and 900 when the polity reached its mature form, but other periods are also discussed; for convenience the stan- dard Copan chronological sequence is presented in Figure 2. All of the authors have been intimately in- volved with the recent Copan research. After di- recting the project from 1977 to 1980, Claude F. Baudez continued his studies of Copan's rich cor- pus of iconography. Berthold Riese has long been connected with various stages of the project as epigrapher. William L. Fash, Jr. began his Copan work during Willey's regime a^id has continued it ever since, most recently with his own project focusing on the Temple of the Hieroglyphic Stair- way. Finally, Sanders and I have directed Phase II since its inception. We gratefully acknowledge the support and encouragement of the IHAH, the National Science Foundation, Wenner-Gren, and all of the North American and Honduran person- nel who made our work possible and productive. Notes on Nomenclature Throughout this volume we have standardized the spellings of two important terms. The name of Copan's last great king, who ruled from a.d. 762 to ca. 800, has been variously rendered in the literature as Yax Pac, Madrugada, New-Sun-at- Horizon, and Rising Sun. For the sake of clarity and consistency we use Rising Sun. Iconographic and epigraphic information from Structure 9N-82 center, as we shall see, has as a basic theme a complex of minor Maya deities. Baudez and Riese prefer to call these deities Bacabs, while Fash would rather refer to them as Pauah Tuns. Sanders and I, unschooled in the vagaries of Maya epigraphic and iconographic de- bates, have no strong opinions on the matter. As editor I have bowed to the majority opinion, and we use the term Bacab throughout, including in the title. Those who prefer the term Pauah Tun may substitute it if they wish, bearing in mind Tozzer's (1941: 136) comment on the issue: "It is impossible to place the Bacabs, the Chacs, the Pauahs and the Uayeyabs, each in a distinct and special category." David Webster University Park, Pennsylvania December 1987 4</page><page sequence="9">CHAPTER 1 The House of the Bacabs: Its Social Context David Webster Introduction Foremost among the goals of Phase II of the Copan Archaeological Project was the investiga- tion of Maya sociopolitical structure at Copan during the Late Classic and Early Post-Classic periods, from ca. a.d. 700, when the sociopoliti- cal system was reaching its mature stage, through its eventual elite and demographic col- lapse several centuries later. By sociopolitical structure I mean particularly the ways in which the Maya organized themselves into kinship and residential groups and the ways in which groups or individuals were articulated into the larger Copan polity. Of specific concern were the re- lated issues of social differentiation and stratifica- tion, especially as reflected in architecture. Herein I provide a general overview of the con- text of the elite Structure 9N-82 center - the House of the Bacabs - which was excavated and reconstructed between 1980 and 1984. Such an overview is necessary to appreciate the detailed analyses and interpretations advanced by my col- leagues in the following chapters. The methods and field strategies used in the in- vestigation of Structure 9N-82 center derive from our scientific theoretical and methodological per- spectives on the one hand, and the expectations of our Honduran sponsors and the previous work done at Copan on the other. Briefly, we feel that the most powerful evidence concerning sociopoliti- cal patterns is recoverable from extensive and rep- resentative samples of architecture - particularly the continuum of domestic architecture assumed to correlate with status differentiation and stratifi- cation. That is, architectural configurations, as well as construction techniques, embellishments, and associated features and artifacts, should all broadly reflect sociopolitical structure. Fortu- nately the Hondurans required rapid exposures of large expanses of architecture. This fact, plus the rich collection of data provided by a century of previous work at Copan and particularly by the projects recently headed by Gordon Willey (1975- 77) and Claude Baudez (1977-80), created a unique archaeological opportunity for conducting operations on the necessary scale. As a result of these operations we are able to evaluate the func- tions of Structure 9N-82 center from a broad sys- temic perspective emphasizing its wider context. Because at the moment many data from the proj- ect, such as artifact distributions and burials, are in preliminary stages of evaluation (although general patterns are clear), my comments will largely fo- cus on architectural configurations and, to some degree, their implications. More extensive analysis and interpretation are found in the following chap- ters, especially Chapter 5. The Urban Core of Copan During the Willey/Baudez projects, systematic surveys were extended for the first time at Copan well beyond the core of monumental buildings 5</page><page sequence="10">Fig. i The Main Group at Copan (redrawn by James Sheehy from originals kindly provided by Hasso Hohmann and Annegrete Vogrin). Numbers have been added indicating structures discussed in the text. 6</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 2 Ceramic chronology for Copan (based on personal communication with Rene Viel, 1984). known as the Main Group (Fig. 1). In the process of recording more than 3400 structures in the Copan pocket (the 24-km2 area immediately around the site core), two dense clusters of build- ings were mapped just to the west and northeast of the Main Group. These zones, labeled El Bosque and Las Sepulturas respectively (Fig. 3), each consist of several hundred mounds and, to- gether with the Main Group, make up what we call the "urban core" of Copan. The word urban is used here in its loosest sense, that is, simply to denote an area of very dense concentrations of architecture and, presumably, prehistoric popula- tion. It was immediately apparent that not only was structure density in the urban core very high but also individual buildings could be grouped into larger aggregates, with considerable variation between these aggregates in terms of structure sizes and numbers, spatial arrangements, and qual- ity of construction. In order to characterize this variation, Willey and his colleagues devised a site typology of five major levels (Willey and Leventhal 1979). Thus, apart from single, isolated mounds, Type 1 groups are lowest on the scale of size and com- plexity and consist of a few small, simply built structures generally arranged around a single courtyard. Such groups are quite numerous. The comparatively rare Type 4 units at the other end of the scale are the most complex, consisting of many structures, some in excess of 5.0 m high, usually arranged around multiple conjoined court- yards. At least some of the larger buildings have vaults, well-cut stone, and sculpture associated with them. Type 2 and Type 3 units fall between these two extremes.

The El Bosque residential enclave can be seen west and southwest of the Main Group; the Las Sepulturas enclave is clearly strung out along the causeway on the northeast. groups of the several types. It was hypothesized that most of the urban core architecture was resi- dential in function and that the observed variation reflected differential household status, the idea be- ing that increasingly larger investments of energy and skill in the higher-order units indicated greater social status for the occupants (Willey et al. 1978). Thus Structure 9N-82 center, the most prominent structure in the largest courtyard of the most impressive Type 4 unit in Las Sepul- turas, was presumably an important building dominating a large elite household complex. The Harvard typology was retained during the Phase II project and, along with the maps that generated it, provided the basis for our own sampling strat- egy. We completely or largely excavated at least 8</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 4 Examples of sites in the Harvard hierarchy. 9</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 5 The Type 4 Group 9N-8, Las Sepulturas. Dotted areas indicate benches. 10</page><page sequence="15">one group on each level. Most of these excava- tions were concentrated in the Las Sepulturas zone. Although the El Bosque and Las Sepulturas zones include architectural units on all levels of the Harvard typology, they can, for several rea- sons, be regarded as primarily elite occupation areas. First, both are immediately adjacent to the Main Group, and the Las Sepulturas zone (and probably El Bosque as well) was linked to it by causeways (Fash 1983a). Second, quality of con- struction is very high in both areas, with well-cut masonry blocks, vault stones, and sculpture often visible on the surface. More significantly, the most complex sites in the settlement hierarchy are heavily concentrated in the urban core. Unlike the Type 1 and 2 groups, which are widely scat- tered throughout the drainage, fully 23 of the 49 known Type 3 and Type 4 sites are located at Las Sepulturas or El Bosque, and virtually all of the others are in the immediately adjacent Copan pocket within 1-4 km of the urban core. This distribution suggests not so much that the elite- level groups are situated to function as important organizational nodes for the whole regional polity in spatial terms, but rather that at Copan there were political advantages in being near the court of the ruler, as well as economic advantages in dominating the valley floor of the Copan pocket. The Early and Middle Pre-Classic inhabitants of the valley favored this zone for settlement long before the Main Group emerged as the dominant political center of the drainage, so the economic motivation appears earlier than the political one. No doubt many of the Type 3 and 4 groups in the urban core represent the establishments of power- ful segments of the Copan population whose ances- tors settled these favored parts of the landscape centuries earlier. By Late Classic times (ca. a.d. 700-850) Webster and Freter (n.d.) have estimated that the urban core had a population of between about 5800 and 9500 people and a population den- sity of about 4900-7750 people per km2, making it one of the largest and densest aggregates of popula- tion known in the Maya Lowlands. Configurations of elite architecture at Maya cen- ters usually occur in central zones of monumental buildings and include "range" structures - lineally arranged rooms on low substructures, commonly also called palaces. Although many such palaces have been cleared and reconstructed (Andrews !975)&gt; very few have been sampled adequately, with the result that their functions remain debat- able (see Harrison n.d. for a review). At many Maya centers such as Uaxactun, Tikal, Palenque, and Uxmal, such elite palace complexes are closely juxtaposed with major ceremonial groups and are integral parts of the core areas of monu- mental civic architecture. At Copan the situation is somewhat different. The Main Group is very compact and well defined, lacking palace com- plexes such as the Central Acropolis at Tikal or the Palace of the Governors at Uxmal. The only excavated building that looks like a palace is the so-called Temple 22 (Fig. 6) located in the East Court (Trik 1939). This building may be the resi- dence of Copan's last ruler, Rising Sun. Most of Copan's elite complexes are concentrated outside Fig. 6 The Structure 22 complex (the Temple of Meditation) (redrawn after Trik 1939). 11</page><page sequence="16">the Main Group, in the rest of the urban core, considering the Cementerios zones just south of the Main Group to be part of El Bosque. Ce- menterios is probably an important elite residen- tial enclave, as Sanders will discuss later. Many of Copan's Type 3 and 4 elite groups are different from their palace counterparts elsewhere in that those at Copan consist of many structures that have grown organically - especially through lateral expansion - into complicated arrangements of conjoined buildings and courtyards with con- siderable internal variations in the size, layout, and quality of construction. Group 9N-8 Because of the size and complexity of Type 4 units, only one could be extensively excavated. Group 9N-8, located near the northeastern end of the Las Sepulturas causeway about 700 m from the Main Group, was chosen as the most impres- sive unit of its kind. In its present state it consists of 11 conjoined courtyards with 40-50 individual buildings (Fig. 5). We know that at least one courtyard just to the east of Courtyard D was largely washed away by the nearby river, which here takes a swing to the west; possibly other structures were destroyed to the south of Court- yard A and north of Courtyard J. Although generally typical of Type 4 units in the size and quality of architecture, Group 9N-8 is unusual in the number of impressive contigu- ous courtyard groups it possesses. A more com- mon pattern is seen in the large Group 8N-11 just to the north, where several very large buildings are arranged around a single plaza, with a few much less impressive satellite groups surrounding it. It should be noted that, although the Type 4 label is applied to groups with multiple courtyard arrangements, not all of these individual court- yards would be so classified if they stood alone. For example, Courtyard C in Group 9N-8 would probably rank by itself as a Type 4 unit, but Courtyard E would be equivalent to a Type 2. The small, low platforms on the northern fringe of the site resemble rural Type 1 units. All six of the major well-preserved courtyards have been largely or wholly excavated, including their plaza surfaces and open spaces beside and behind buildings. Between 40 and $0 structures and about 95 associated rooms have been cleared. 1 Although some untested areas exist on the fringes of the site and, as previously noted, some parts of it have been destroyed, we have an excellent sam- ple that probably includes 80 percent of the group as it originally stood. Because our excavations were so extensive, four full seasons were required to excavate the several courtyard groups. During the winter and spring of 1980-81, the latest level of Courtyard A along with Structures 80, 81, part of 83, and all of 82 except the rear wall were cleared by Elliot Abrams and me. William Fash finished the excavation of Structure 83 and also conducted deep soundings in the plaza, which produced, among other things, a spectacular Middle Classic burial (now in the Copan museum) and a Middle Pre-Classic cemetery. The next year Fash and the project restorer, Rudi Larios V., cleared the rear slope of Structure 82, where they encoun- tered much of the sculpture upon which are based the reconstructions discussed later. Work continued in the courtyard through 1984, and it is now completely reconstructed. Quality of architecture varies markedly from one courtyard to another. Many buildings in the northern part of Group 9N-82 are built with indif- ferently cut stone or natural cobbles, in sharp con- trast to the imposing constructions in Courtyard A. This striking variation within a single elite complex clearly indicates that a variety of social/ residential groups of different statuses was pres- ent. In addition, some individual structures may have had special, nonresidential functions, as Sanders discusses in Chapter 5. Deep soundings and structural trenching revealed a long series of occupations during which individual courtyard units were grafted onto the growing complex, and then themselves changed internally to assume their final forms. Most of the architecture shown in Figure 5 was probably in use during the end of 'Because of the conjoined pattern of the architecture and its organic process of growth, it is difficult and misleading to attempt to give exact numbers at this stage of analysis. 12</page><page sequence="17">the Late Classic period, from a.d. 750 to 800, although some of the buildings, as we shall see, were occupied or even constructed long after the royal collapse at Copan, conventionally dated to ca. a.d. 800. As expected, in contexts that are basically resi- dential, virtually all parts of the Group 9N-8 com- plex show signs of frequent modifications. These range from small-scale changes in individual rooms, such as the blocking off of doorways or partitioning of interior space, through the addi- tion of structures by lateral expansion, modifica- tion of whole courtyard arrangements, and ulti- mately construction of whole new plaza groups adjacent to old ones. Courtyard D offers a good example of these changes. Originally the plaza was dominated by a large, formal building on the east (Structure 63) that contained several major vaulted tombs and had a (probably) nondomestic superstructure building. Later this superstructure was modified to conform to a residential plan common at Copan, and arrangements of small rooms were extended and themselves modified along the northern and western sides of the plaza. Space became so much prized that a large plat- form (Structure 105) was eventually constructed in the plaza itself, and at some point a whole new courtyard unit (K), of impressive but shoddily built architecture, was erected to the east of Court- yard D, only to be later largely washed away by the river. Various specialized activities not directly re- lated to domestic functions also took place in the courtyards. For example, Randolph Widmer, while excavating the western rooms in Courtyard H, found clear indications of the processing of shell artifacts and, less certainly, of weaving. One of the more informal courtyards (J) is char- acterized by low platforms that must have sup- ported perishable superstructures; it lies just to the west of Courtyard D. This area probably was used for a variety of mundane tasks, which re- sulted in the deposition of an extensive midden extending along its eastern edge; at least one of its buildings appears to have been a kitchen. A final indication of the importance of residen- tial functions for the group as a whole is seen in the benches, which take up most of the space in almost every excavated room. It is generally as- sumed that such benches provided sleeping and sitting space in Maya houses (e.g., Adams 1970). Such an interpretation is supported by our discov- ery of the remains of a woman on a bench in one of the small rooms between Courtyards B and H; apparently she had been sleeping on the bench when the room's heavy beam-and-mortar roof collapsed. It should be stressed, however, that benches undoubtedly had many functions (see "The Hieroglyphic Bench," pp. 30-34) and that ethnohistoric data suggest special-purpose rooms might be used as sleeping space. For example, Redfield and Villa Rojas (1934) point out that in Chan Kom, as domestic complexes were en- larged, family members continued to sleep in kitchens. It is instructive to compare the plan of Group 9N-8, as a major elite complex, with that of the Central Acropolis at Tikal (Harrison n.d.). Apart from the obvious difference in scale, we find less order and more evidence for continuous, organic growth in the Copan complex. Also lacking are the linear arrangements of highly uniform modu- lar room components that are found in the Central Acropolis. These differences may reflect several things. First, the Central Acropolis is obviously a "higher-rank" complex in the sense that it is proba- bly the remains of the household of an actual ruler, while Group 9N-8, judging from its location well away from the Main Group, is not. If the "house- hold" model of Maya centers is correct (cf. Sand- ers 1981), we would expect the Central Acropolis, as a much more dominant elite establishment in its particular sociopolitical context, to be more com- plex and to exhibit in its configuration a wider array of specialized activities consistent with rul- ership. Thus the modular rooms mentioned above may have served as storage facilities, administra- tive units, or guest facilities for distinguished visi- tors. By contrast, Group 9N-8 probably func- tioned somewhat more narrowly as the residential complex for a second-rank noble lineage. There may, of course, be cultural reasons as well for some of the differences in layout, especially be- cause Copan is located in the southeastern frontier 13</page><page sequence="18">of the Maya Lowlands. In fact, it is our impression that the distinctive Courtyard D has unusual amounts of imported polychrome wares from non-Maya regions further to the east in Honduras, as well as some unusual burial configurations. These patterns, as yet provisional, may turn out to indicate the presence of a resident foreign popula- tion. Ample evidence points to residential functions for Structure 9N-82 as a whole. Virtually all op- erations uncovered domestic trash and refuse, in- cluding utilitarian pottery, lithics, and ground stone. Deep middens were commonly encoun- tered around the edges of courtyards and sloping down from the rear walls of buildings (Webster and Abrams 1983: fig. 2). We also assumed that, if the hypothesis that the urban core groups are remains of domestic house- holds was correct, we would recover abundant burials from them; Group 9N-8 was certainly no disappointment in this regard. Rebecca Storey, who is currently analyzing the burials, informs me that approximately 250 individuals are represented in our current sample from Group 9N-8 (personal communication, March 1988). Inasmuch as many burial contexts remain untested, it is likely that 400-500 people were interred in Group 9N-8 dur- ing the major phases of its occupation. Burials in- clude people of all ages and both sexes, reminis- cent of the burial population of the palace phases of the A-V complex at Uaxactun. They are found in all plazas, but there were several concentrations. Courtyard D has 47 burial contexts representing a probable total of more than 60 individuals. Court- yards E and F not only have abundant burials (67 identified to date), but a very peculiar sex distribu- tion. Of the sexable individuals in these court- yards, only two are males. All the rest are females or children too young to allow adequate sexing. This extraordinary sexual imbalance suggests that these courtyards had very specialized functions, perhaps serving as residential zones for women and their offspring attached directly to Courtyard A. One of our hypotheses when we began opera- tions in 9N-8 was that we would find evidence for polygyny in the burial remains there. The Court- yard E-F sample is strong confirmation of this idea, as is the overall proportion of females to males in the 9N-8 group as a whole; Storey esti- mates that at least two-thirds of all the recovered, sexable burials are those of women. All of this evidence strikingly supports the hy- pothetical residential functions for the Las Sepultu- ras groups originally advanced by Willey and his colleagues and flatly contradicts Adams' (1977: 152) assertion that "... almost nothing can be designated as elite class residences at Copan." In fairness to Adams, at the time these words were written we were only beginning work outside the Main Group. The lesson is, of course, that ade- quate settlement survey and excavation are neces- sary before such negative judgments are war- ranted. As always in archaeology, the larger and more representative the sample, the easier the in- terpretation; perhaps the greatest virtue of the Phase II work is the extensiveness of its architec- tural exposures. Relative Construction Chronology of the qN-8 Courtyards The settlement pattern of Group 9N-8, as shown in Figure 5, represents the culmination of a long process of growth that probably began early in the Pre-Classic period and continued, at least intermittently, through the Early and Mid- dle Classic phases. The structures now visible on the surface, and in many instances immediately precedent buried structures, postdate a.d. 700. It is necessary to understand this Late Classic and Early Post-Classic phase of activity in order to place Courtyard A and the House of the Bacabs in their proper perspectives. We have not yet sorted out all the details of this growth phase, but Sanders and I wish to offer our informed impres- sions of its general outlines. Courtyards A and B are clearly the dominant ones both socially and chronologically. This con- clusion is based on the complexity of their archi- tecture, their position on a large artificial plat- form, and the presence (below Courtyard A) of a long sequence of indications of at least intermit- tent activity dating back to ca. 900 B.C. These courtyards seem to have been important through- 14</page><page sequence="19">out the eighth century and to have experienced major episodes of growth accentuating their so- cial and political importance around the end of that century, with some continued activity for a considerable time thereafter. The conjoined Courtyards E and F appear to have been important throughout this general time span as well, although the most ornate buildings in E were probably added around or even built after a.d. 800. Although there was activity in Courtyard H early in the eighth century, it too seems to have undergone major revision at the very end of the Classic period. This revision most notably involved the structures on the west side in which there is evidence for specialized eco- nomic activity. Courtyard D appears to have had a large ritual structure (63) during the middle of the eighth cen- tury, but most of the other flanking constructions appear to be terminal Late Classic or Post-Classic in date. All the surviving shoddily built structures in the adjacent Courtyard K may well be Post- Classic. Several of the small and unimpressive struc- tures in the northern Courtyard J are early, but at least one major kitchen facility was built late in the eighth century to service people in Court- yards B or C. Courtyard J probably had service functions as opposed to residential ones and was an area of trash disposal and occasional burial. The imposing Courtyard C has traces of early structures beneath its western margin, but these probably related to another, now destroyed patio group. The bulk of the construction around Courtyard C appears to be very late - possibly built around a.d. 800 or somewhat later. Several preliminary conclusions related to this pattern of growth are pertinent. First, although individual courtyards obviously have planned lay- outs, the evolution of the group reflects a process of long-term growth punctuated by bursts of ac- tivity, and the group as a whole is in no sense planned in terms of its layout. Second, the pro- cess was one of accretion, in which courtyard complexes were added to the core of the site as represented by Courtyards A and B. All court- yards underwent modifications, but these were very different and reflect a variety of functions and status associations for individual units. As far as we can tell, during much of the eighth century - perhaps until well after a.d. 750 - the group as a whole was relatively unimpressive com- pared to its final form in terms of the size, quality, and embellishment of its buildings and the number of courtyards present. During this time there was probably considerable redundancy in function (mainly residential), and, though differences in sta- tus existed among the courtyard residents, these were probably not as strikingly reflected in archi- tectural variation as they would become later. Around the last quarter of the eighth century there were drastic modifications. Large, vaulted build- ings were constructed, some decorated with sculp- ture. Inscribed monuments bearing dates and titles were erected in Courtyard A, which outstrips all the rest in size and splendor. New residential facili- ties were built, one of which (Courtyard D) may have housed non-Maya residents. New facilities also appeared for specialized economic activity. This spurt of growth continued after the royal col- lapse around a.d. 800 (see discussion of absolute chronology, pp. 35~ 39)- The overall picture for 9N-8 is that of an elite residential zone of great antiquity, which was ex- tremely important in terms of the status of its occupants during the Late Classic period, and es- pecially during the reign of Rising Sun, when it developed into an elite establishment second only to the Main Group itself. Late in the eighth cen- tury it experienced unprecedented growth in size and population, internal social differentiation be- came more marked, and the group became more complex and differentiated in its functions. The House of the Bacabs represents the apogee of the fortunes of the 9N-8 elites, who were able to weather the political storm around a.d. 800 that undermined the Copan kings, not only surviving but perhaps even prospering for as much as two centuries thereafter. Description of Courtyard A Dominating Group 9N-8 is the massive Court- yard A complex, composed of four large build- 15</page><page sequence="20">Fig. 7 The Courtyard A complex, Group 9N-8, Copan. Dotted areas indicate benches, hatched lines the locations of middens. ings arranged around a central plaza. The whole complex, as shown in Figure 7, covers an area of approximately 0.25 ha and is situated on the south- ern part of a large artificially raised platform edged with massive stone blocks, some of which have been exposed just to the rear of the southern build- ing (Structure 110C) in Courtyard H. This plat- form may have been intended to elevate the central courtyards (A and B) above the level of most of the others, thus emphasizing their social impor- tance. Certainly the platform functioned to protect the complex from the encroachments of the Copan River, which flows south past Group 9N-8 before curving away to the southwest. An imposing stone stairway ascends the west face of the plat- form near the northwest corner of Courtyard A, providing access to several plazas via a long corri- dor running on an east-west line through the cen- ter of the group just to the north of Courtyard A. The Plaza The Courtyard A plaza, measured from the cen- tral points of the stairways of the flanking build- ings, is 30.39 m long and 22.8 m wide, with a total area of about 640 m2. It has the shape of a skewed rectangle because the long southern build- ing does not have the same consistent orientation to the cardinal directions seen in the others, which are aligned within 2 degrees of true north. Because we suspect that many household func- tions carried out indoors in temperate climates were in fact done outside by the Lowland Maya, we stripped the entire plaza, hoping to find evidence of activity areas. As is commonly the case at Copan, the plaza was surfaced with relatively smooth, flat river cobbles. Traces of grouting in the form of chips of volcanic tuff and limestone - probably the byproducts of stone construction - are found in the soil overlying the cobbles, suggesting that all or most of the plaza was originally plastered. Be- cause of the relatively thin soil cover and moist conditions, virtually all traces of plaster have disap- peared except along the fronts of buildings, where collapse debris has protected them to some degree (e.g., such patches of plaster were found running along the fronts of Structures 82 and 83). Al- though the plaza was resurfaced several times, we are here concerned only with its latest phase. Because the three largest buildings in Courtyard 16</page><page sequence="21">A became joined in the process of their growth (see pp. 34-35, "Relative Construction Phasing of the Courtyard A Complex"), access was rather limited, as we would expect in an elite residential complex. Principal access was almost certainly through the major gap between Structures 80 and 81. Not only is this opening closest to the large stairway ascending the platform, but there is evi- dence (in the form of very large and well-cut stone blocks) of some sort of formal plaza edging con- necting the two buildings. Unfortunately the area has been so looted and disturbed that we cannot reconstruct the original configuration of this fea- ture. Another route of access is through a similar gap between Structures 80 and 83. If any barrier existed here it must have been of a perishable na- ture. Interestingly, only one building - Structure 9N-78 just to the south of Courtyard H - fronts onto the major east-west corridor, and it does so near the latter gap, suggesting that it might have functioned as some sort of special-purpose struc- ture for the Courtyard A group (see Chapter 5 for an elaboration of this point). Apart from these two major entry ways there is only one other point of access. At the junction of Structures 82 and 83 we found a stairway descending about 2 m to a low plaza surface strewn with artifacts, including whole smashed Coner-phase vessels, sherds, obsid- ian, and ground stone implements. These were in a narrow corridor formed by the south wall of Structure 82 and an as yet unexcavated platform to the southeast of Courtyard A. This stairway is too steep and narrow ever to have been an important entryway; it probably allowed access to ancillary activity areas outside the courtyard and also pro- vided a convenient route down to the nearby river. Complete stripping of the plaza surface re- vealed several features. Two small uncarved cylin- drical altars were found at the bases of the stair- ways of Structures 80 and 83. A large sheet midden 2 m wide stretched along the front of Structure 83 for a distance of about 6 m (Fig. 7). Like the deposit off the south edge of the build- ing, artifacts included Coner-phase utilitarian ma- terials such as ceramics, obsidian, manos and metates, and animal bone. Some of this material may have extended a little way up the stairs, but this is not certain because of the wall collapse. Two other midden-like concentrations occur - one off the east wall of Structure 80, and another off the north wall of Structure 81. The latter was especially rich in sherd material, including im- ported Ulua Polychrome ceramics. Interestingly, this deposit was outside the area we think was formally delineated by a plaza boundary and did not spill over the intact edging stones or inner plaza surface, thus reinforcing the suggestion of some sort of barrier in this vicinity. The presence of these midden deposits, of which at least one (at the bottom of the northeast- ern stairway) represents a primary activity area, is tantalizing. Excavations in so-called "palace" com- plexes in the Maya Lowlands frequently produce few artifacts apart from those in structural fill (Ad- ams 1977: 146). Sometimes this absence may be more apparent than real, because such complexes are generally tested rather than completely exca- vated. Nevertheless, it has been difficult to consis- tently find close associations between such palaces and activity areas, particularly of a utilitarian na- ture. Those skeptical of the postulated residential functions of at least parts of palace complexes could point to this absence of occupational debris as evidence that palaces served purposes other than elite houses. The rejoinder, of course, is that elite residences were probably kept very clean and that various essential tasks were done at a distance by menials or household members, thus leaving behind no immediate traces. Taken at face value the middens discovered in the Courtyard A complex would seem to support the interpretation that the surrounding buildings had, at least in part, residential functions. Clearly various utilitarian tasks such as food preparation and trash disposal were taking place on and around the plaza. Basically, there are two possi- bilities for assigning them dates. The middens could be contemporary with the main elite occu- pation before a.d. 800. Alternatively, they could postdate the royal collapse by some time, during which no drastic ceramic changes took place. In this case, the middens could reflect reuse of the area by nonelite squatters or, more likely, the rem- nants of the former elite population living in 17</page><page sequence="22">more humble circumstances. Fortunately, we are now in a position to sort out these possibilities, and the chronology of the middens is discussed in the context of a general consideration of the abso- lute dating of Courtyard A (pp. 35-39). The Courtyard A Architecture Four structures delineate the plaza (Fig. 7). One - Structure 80 on the north - is a free- standing building. The others - Structures 81, 82, and 83 - were conjoined in their final phase, al- though they can be regarded as separate for de- scriptive purposes. All appeared as grass-covered mounds prior to excavation, but even in that state the elite quality of the buildings was evident in their size and by the cut stone and sculpture that could be seen on the surface. It was also apparent that there was considerable variation among them. Traces of lineally arranged superstructure rooms could be seen on the summits of Structures 82 and 83. By contrast Structure 81 had what appeared to be only a small superstructure on its northern end, while Structure 80, the smallest of the four, seemed to have no obvious summit building at all. Structure 80 Structure 80, because of its isolation, small sum- mit area, and apparent lack of superstructure, seemed to us from the beginning to be a good candidate for a special-purpose building. Specifi- cally, we hypothesized that it was a shrine, fol- lowing earlier suggestions by Becker (n.d.) and others that specialized religious buildings would have been prominent features of Maya household arrangements - especially those of elites. Unfortu- nately, excavations quickly revealed that Struc- ture 80 had suffered to an unusual degree from stone robbing. Only a few courses of masonry were intact around the base of the substructure and the stairway. Enough remained to indicate that the green tuff masonry was of high quality and that the original dimensions of the apparently terraced substructure were 16 by 8.15 m. A stair- way 5.2 m wide and outset 1.2 m from the sub- structure ascended on the south side of the mound to its summit 2.4 m above the level of the plaza. Because destruction was severe, Abrams, who excavated most of Structure 80, was able to recon- struct only the general configuration of the sum- mit building. Basically it consisted of a single, large room about 10 m long and 4.6 m wide (inner dimensions) defined by walls of rather rough masonry. The room was entered through a doorway about 1.2 m wide in its south wall. The only interior features, apart from the cobble floor, were the remains of a roughly built bench projecting from the rear wall and traces of what may have been a second bench in the southwest corner of the room. The narrow (40-60 cm) and poorly built wall bases of the superstructure, to- gether with the absence of vault stones in the col- lapse debris, suggest a rather light wall construc- tion originally surmounted by a perishable roof. Three pieces of simple stone sculpture carved with spiral motifs were found during clearing of the front stairs and terrace. Although these carv- ings in all likelihood fell from the front facade of the building, Structure 80 certainly was not ex- travagantly decorated. Abrams drove a 2-m wide trench through the cobble-and-earth core of the mound, partly to ex- pose earlier construction but in particular to search for an interior burial, which we hypothe- sized might be present if Structure 80 were an early shrine associated with the founder of the courtyard group. No such burial was encoun- tered, but an earlier terraced substructure was present. Recovered from the fill of this earlier building was the stone sculpture of a human head adorned with a helmet and earspools. Apart from the small altar found at the foot of the stairway on the plaza floor, none of the fea- tures associated with Structure 80 supports the shrine hypothesis, although we believe, on the basis of comparisons with other excavated groups, that this remains the most likely func- tion of the building. One reason for this infer- ence is that Structure 80 in its last phase experi- enced none of the expansion and alteration char- acteristic of other buildings that have more obvi- ous residential functions. 18</page><page sequence="23">Structure 83 Courtyard A is delineated on the east by the imposing Structure 83; the following description is taken largely from the preliminary report by Fash, who excavated most of it. When cleared of collapse rubble, the substructure was found to have basal dimensions of 19. 1 m (N-S) by 10.3 m (E-W). Along its entire west side runs a stairway, somewhat disturbed by stone robbing but gener- ally well preserved, which is interlocked at its southern end with the stairway of Structure 82. Five steps lead up to a wide terrace about 1.95 m above the level of the plaza. The rear (east) wall of the substructure is slightly higher and has two terraced levels instead of being plumb. The qual- ity of the masonry - almost entirely the ubiqui- tous green tuff - is very good, comparable to that on the more elaborate Structure 82. While testing the inner core of the substructure, Fash encoun- tered the remains of an earlier, low Coner-phase (Late Classic) platform, indicating that at least two buildings stood successively on this spot. On the summit of the substructure was a sin- gle, long building divided into five rooms - three large central rooms with doors facing out onto the plaza and two very small rooms at each end with doorways facing north and south. Super- structure masonry was of high quality and, ex- cept for the rear wall which had largely fallen away, was extremely well preserved, with walls still standing to heights of 1-2 m. We are not sure how Structure 83 was roofed. Certainly its walls were massive enough to have held a vault, but no vault stones were found in the collapse debris of the building. Fash believes that the thick walls carried a beam-and-mortar roof of the kind we know was used elsewhere in Group 9N-8 (especially in the eastern buildings of Courtyard H). However, none of the collapse de- bris found on the summit of Structure 83 looks as if it derived from such a roof, and I believe the building was thatched. On either side of the wide doorway of the cen- tral room (Room 1) was a row of T-shaped stone blocks set into the wall; these may have been purely decorative, but Fash suggests that they rep- resent the glyphic ik sign, associated with the con- cepts of life and germination. It will be remem- bered that a small stone altar was found on the plaza at the base of the steps roughly aligned with the central doorway. Interestingly, three Coner- phase burials were found beneath the plaza in this area - the largest single concentration in the Courtyard A complex. All three central rooms are fairly spacious by Copan standards, ranging in area between ap- proximately 14 and 17 m2. In each most of the floor space is taken up by a raised bench. These are of basically similar construction except that the bench in Room 1 is C-shaped and the bench in Room 2 has a small, shelf-like projection along the northern transverse room wall. Bench sur- faces and room floors were covered with very thick coats (10-15 cm) of beautifully preserved plaster showing occasional patches of red paint. Such plaster was also found on the terrace flank- ing the front of the room complex, and it seems likely that all interior and exterior surfaces of the building were originally covered. Apart from the benches and cordholders in the masonry of the walls, all three rooms lacked other features or concentrations of artifacts on their floors. Circular burn marks on the plaster of the floors and benches suggest that braziers, which occur in the Coner-phase ceramic inven- tory, were used for heat. The tiny (ca. 3.1 m2) Room 5 was an integral part of the original construction, but its some- what larger counterpart on the north, Room 4, was created by blocking off an earlier large room (which would have included Room 4) with a transverse wall. Later Room 4 itself was further subdivided by another such wall. Both of these rooms are small and inconvenient in terms of ac- cess; although they are not too small to be ruled out as sleeping space, they may well have served some more specialized functions. Structure 83 emerges as a rather typical palace- type building, except for its nonvaulted roof. Cer- tainly its central rooms provided adequate sleeping and sitting space to have been used as dormitories. It contrasts with the central superstructure of Struc- ture 9N-82 largely in its lack of vaults and abun- 19</page><page sequence="24">Fig. 8 Structure 81 showing positions of ball game par- aphernalia and other artifacts found during excavation. dant sculptural decoration, and it is more well built and spacious (especially in its central rooms) than the lateral superstructures of Structure 82, which are described below. Structure 81 In many ways Structure 81, which is situated along the western side of the plaza, is one of the most intriguing buildings in the whole Courtyard A complex (Fig. 8). Even before excavation, some of its special qualities were recognized. Clearly only the northern half of the large sub- structure was occupied by a summit building, and this, judging from surface debris, was of much lighter and poorer construction than the super- structures of Structures 82 and 83. Our initial hy- pothesis was that this building was a lower-status residence than the others, but excavation soon in- dicated otherwise. Another peculiar feature was that the stairway running along the eastern edge of the building, although connected with Struc- ture 82 on the south, did not continue all the way to the northern end of the substructure. As will become clear later, this feature is related to the major construction episodes of the courtyard group as a whole. Overall, the substructure measures 19.12 m (N-S) by 15.00 m (E-W). The summit, reached by the eastern stairway, is about 1.45 m above plaza level. A peculiarity of Structure 81 is that it is built on the edge of the huge artificial platform underlying the whole Group 9N-8 and relates not only to Courtyard A but to Courtyard E to the west as well. Because the latter courtyard is at a much lower level, the rear (west) face of the sub- structure is actually about 3.3 m high, rising in a series of three broad terraces. No convenient route of access, such as a stairway, was found leading up from Courtyard E to Structure 81. Exposure of the northern superstructure re- vealed a rectangular building about 10.7 m by 6.0 m in area, with a total interior space of just over 36 m2. A low back bench juts out from the rear wall, and the northern part of the building was probably partitioned off to form a smaller room. As we had anticipated from our surface examina- tions, the quality of wall construction was poor. Well-cut stone was found mainly in the door- jambs and the basal courses; for the most part walls were composed of indifferently cut blocks or natural cobbles and were too flimsy to have carried anything heavier than a pole-and-thatch roof. Collapse debris was shallow, suggesting that masonry did not extend all the way up to the eaves, but had upper components of perishable materials, as known for some recent Maya houses (Wauchope 1938: pls. 20c, d). Through careful excavation of the collapsed rear wall, Abrams was able to estimate the height of the masonry of the rear wall at 1.6 m. Despite its comparatively poor construction, Structure 81 was clearly anything but common- place. The first surprising finds were two beauti- fully sculpted jaguar heads of green tuff, slightly smaller than life size, on the front terrace (Fig. 9). 20</page><page sequence="25">Fig. 9 Jaguar head recovered from front terrace of Structure 81. These had obviously been tenoned into the exte- rior walls and originally flanked the central door- way. More surprises were revealed during the clearing of the room floor. Bits of charcoal and burned daub indicated that parts of the superstruc- ture had burned and then collapsed onto the well- preserved plaster floor. Unlike similar contexts everywhere else in the Group 9N-8 complex, there were numerous artifacts in direct association with this floor (Fig. 8). These included two smashed vessels, a large olla near the southern wall, and an effigy incensario painted and mod- eled with a mustachioed human face just inside the doorway of the little northern partition. Most unexpected, however, were stone replicas of ball game paraphernalia. In the northern part of the main room we found a complete yoke - the pad- ded component of the costume that protected a player's waist. Fragments of no fewer than six additional yokes were identified by Mary Spink from ground stone recovered during the clearing of the superstructure. Two carved hachas were also on the floor. These are replicas of the decora- tive effigies ball players wore attached to the rear of their costumes. One, found broken near the yoke, represented a stylized macaw head. The other, from the northern partition, was a death's head with a shell eye inlay. Unlike the vessels, which seem to have been on the floor when the roof collapsed, the yoke and hachas appear to have fallen from above. Although ball game parapher- nalia are commonly recovered during excavations in Maya centers, they are usually in ritual con- texts such as caches or have been redeposited in construction fill. So far as I know, these are the only specimens to have been found in such clear primary association with a structure. As a result of all these finds, our hypothesis that Structure 81 was a normal residence had to be abandoned. Despite its inferior construction, it was obviously a special-purpose building of some importance, which, among other things, housed ritual objects. The ball game, of course, was an important ritual sport among the Maya elite, and the presence of these items reinforces the interpre- tation of Courtyard A as an elite complex. There is, strangely enough, no ball court in the Las Sepulturas enclave, as there are in the Main Group and the El Bosque. Presumably the elite players from Group 9N-8 desported themselves 21</page><page sequence="26">in one of these, although there could have been a now destroyed court at Las Sepulturas some- where along the river. Structure 81 was probably a clubhouse/dormi- tory/school for unmarried young men (in this case, elite young men) such as described by Landa (Tozzer 1941: 124). Significantly, Landa associates the men's house with various games, including ball playing. If we are correct in identifying Struc- ture 223 at the Main Group as having similar func- tions on a more grandiose scale, then the Court- yard A building may indicate that men's house facilities were present in elite households of vari- ous ranks. Apart from the large superstructure just de- scribed, only one other building was discov- ered - a tiny but well-built room on the upper- most western terrace. This was originally thatched and had associated with it large amounts of utilitarian ceramics. As mentioned earlier, the southern half of the superstructure supported no building. Here we uncovered a flat, cobble-paved terrace that would have been convenient for such outdoor activities as food processing (Fig. 7). Of course there origi- nally might have been some sort of light, perish- able, ramada-like structure here, but if so, no traces could be seen. Two dense concentrations of artifacts were associated with the terrace. One was at the junction of the south wall of the main building and the cobbled terrace surface. The other was in and around a highly disturbed, ma- sonry, hearth-like construction (Feature 9) on the south end of the terrace. Here we found ceramics, obsidian, and ground stone artifacts, including celts and part of a stone vessel. We have no idea what this feature is, but I would like to offer a speculation. In the putative men's house (Str. 223) in the Main Group we found an elaborate sweat bath. None exists in the Structure 81 room. If these are both men's houses, as suggested, and if sweat baths were important facilities associated with such places, then Feature 9 (covered by a perishable superstructure) could have been part of a sweat bath. Alternatively (or additionally), the tiny room on the western terrace just described could have served the same function. In neither case, however, are such elaborate and distinctive features as drains present, which would strongly support this suggestion. Thus it remains highly speculative. Abrams excavated a large trench into the ter- race and its front stairway and found the remains of an earlier Coner-phase building buried by the last one. This consisted of a terraced platform with a superstructure very much like the one con- taining the ball game materials. The chronologi- cal significance of this earlier building is analyzed more fully below. Structure 82 - The House of the Bacabs Having discussed its general context we now turn to Structure 82, the main subject of this mono- graph (Figs. 10, 11). Surface mapping by Willey's project had shown that Structure 82 was not only the largest structure in Group 9N-8 but in the whole Las Sepulturas enclave as well. In fact, it is one of the largest buildings to be found in the Copan Valley anywhere outside the Main Group. It dominates Courtyard A and clearly, whatever its functions, was a major elite construction. Structure 82 was in an extremely good state of preservation, largely because of the excellent qual- ity of its green tuff stonework and because it had been minimally disturbed by looters. It was not really excavated so much as cleared - that is, the main effort was to remove the collapse debris from the upper walls from the wall bases, room interiors, and substructure itself and three summit buildings. Each of these will be briefly described, although our main concern is with the central summit building. The Substructure The huge basal platform of Structure 82 is ap- proximately 46 m long and 10 m wide (Fig. 5). A monumental stairway just over 30 m long runs the entire length of the front (north) face, which borders on the plaza. Five steps ascend the plat- form, leading to a front terrace about 1.96 m above plaza level. Four of the stairway blocks found roughly on the center line of the building (i.e., roughly centered on the doorway of the 22</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 10 Structure 9N-82 center. Fig. 1 1 Structure 9N-82 center during reconstruction. 23</page><page sequence="28">House of the Bacabs) bore glyphs (Fig. 10); these were fragments of earlier monuments - probably stelae - and seem to present no coherent text. Al- though their placement may have had some ritual significance for the occupants of the building, the glyphs probably were invisible, inasmuch as the whole stairway (and indeed the whole building) seems to have been thickly covered with plaster. Retaining walls on the east, west, and south faces of the platform, which were originally essen- tially vertical faces of masonry, were less well preserved than was the stairway. Even so, wall bases were everywhere intact, and retaining walls still stood, in some areas, to heights of 2 m or more. A small vaulted room - Room 9 (see Fig. 5) - was built as an original component of the eastern section of the substructure. It measured only 1.56 m by 2.38 m, and its central doorway opened out onto the activity area formed by the junction of Structures 82 and 83. This area, it will be remem- bered, is at a much lower level than the plaza and is reached by a steep stairway. Midden debris was found at the base of the steps, and there was also an unexcavated rectangular platform here. It is tempt- ing to conclude that Room 9 was a special-purpose room related to the domestic activities being car- ried out nearby. On the other hand, the room is very formal in its construction and well finished with plaster. It is furnished with a high rear bench, and each wall has a niche in the masonry. The latter are rather rare at Las Sepulturas and, as Sand- ers argues later, suggest ritual functions. Abrams' test trenches into the front of the cen- tral part of the substructure revealed a buried ter- race, indicating that an earlier Coner-phase build- ing stood on this spot. This building was finally covered by the latest construction material of the House of the Bacabs and was partially razed at that time. Deposited in the final-phase construc- tion fill were found, nine m apart, the head and body of a full-round sculpture of a human figure about 55 cm high (cf. Fig. 45). The figure is a male, seated cross-legged, holding a sectioned conch shell in one hand and a stylus in the other. Because these implements are presumably associ- ated with writing, we have named this figure "The Scribe." Its significance for the interpreta- tion of Structure 82 will become clear in Fash's discussion of the iconography (Chapter 2). The Superstructure Buildings The original surface mapping of Structure 82 done by Willey's Harvard project suggested that there was one large summit building. Excavations revealed that there were in fact three separate ones, built, as we shall see, at different times. These three summit buildings are designated as the east, west, and central superstructures. Al- though there is some variation in construction, with the lateral (especially the eastern) superstruc- tures more shoddily built than the central one, construction is generally of excellent quality. Walls of green tuff are well faced and thick - in some places more than a meter wide. Sections still stood to heights of well over 2 m, but the rear walls had entirely collapsed. The Western Superstructure. The western super- structure consisted of three rooms and was origi- nally 5.4 m wide and about 14.2 m long. Its front facade is set back 40-50 cm from the line of the front wall of the adjacent central building, thus visually emphasizing the importance of the latter. Originally there were two main rooms of roughly equal size; these rooms were entered from the front terrace through wide, north-facing doorways and did not interconnect. Each room had a large back bench and a lower end bench. At some point the eastern room was partitioned off into two separate rooms by the addition of a trans- verse wall. Floors, walls, and benches were origi- nally surfaced with thick plaster. No artifacts or features were in certain association with floors or benches. Although the walls were thick enough to have supported a masonry vault, only a few vault stones were found in the collapse debris. Also lacking were the large plaster fragments that were found with the other superstructure build- ings. Although a beam-and-mortar roof cannot be ruled out, the western superstructure probably supported a pole-and-thatch roof. 24</page><page sequence="29">The Eastern Superstructure. The eastern super- structure is similar in general layout to the west- ern, but is of inferior construction and is less well preserved. Although of similar width, it is much shorter (only about 10 m), so the rooms are less spacious. No modifications of rooms or benches occurred here. We found huge fragments of plaster - some up to 20-cm thick - in the collapse of the front wall of the superstructure and many vault stones as well, so a vaulted roof is clearly indicated. Corridor Rooms. Because the three summit buildings were originally built as separate units, two corridors existed between them. The narrow eastern corridor remains, but the wider western one was converted into two tiny rooms by the extension of rather flimsy and structurally weak walls from the ends of the two flanking super- structures. A front and rear room arrangement was thus created, with the floor of the rear room slightly higher than that of the front. A tiny bench is found just to the right of the doorway of the outer room. Both rooms have wall niches. We do not know how these rooms were roofed, although they were certainly not vaulted. The functions of these little rooms remain un- known, although Sanders believes they were largely ritual (Chapter 5). Certainly their creation was an afterthought and, in fact, caused some in- convenience (note in Fig. 10 that one of the inner transverse walls partially blocks off the doorway to the western room in the central superstructure). The Central Superstructure I turn, finally, to the central superstructure, which, along with its associated features, is the main subject of this monograph (Fig. 10). This building is referred to as Structure 9N-82 center or, because of its associated inscriptions and ico- nography, the House of the Bacabs. Roughly cen- tered on the basal platform, it measures 15 mm length and is approximately 6.5 m wide. There are three lineally arranged rooms, with the mid- dle one by far the largest - 3.60 m by 6.65 m. A wide central doorway leads into this room from the front (north) terrace; both of the side rooms are entered from side doorways opening into the corridors. There was originally a connection be- tween the main room and the eastern one, but this was blocked off at some point with well-cut, plastered stones. Huge benches occupy most of the interior space in all three rooms. The lateral rooms have L-shaped or C-shaped benches; the main room has a sculptured bench, which is dis- cussed at length in the following section. Construction techniques used on the central su- perstructure are excellent - fully comparable to anything seen in the Main Group. Heavy plaster was intact on the horizontal surfaces of the benches and floors, and traces were also found on the walls. Patches of red paint were found in all rooms, and this must have been the predominant interior color, as found elsewhere in elite struc- tures in the Las Sepulturas enclave. Walls are very heavy (80-90 cm along the front and more than a meter along the rear). Some 114 vault stones were recovered from the collapse of the upper walls, along with huge pieces of plaster that capped the roof. Thus Structure 9N-82 center was unques- tionably vaulted, as befits its elite status. Walls were preserved to over 2 m in height, but the vault spring must have been considerably higher than this. As reconstructed by Fash and Larios, the whole building must have stood about 7 m high, thus presenting impressive front and rear fagades to the north and south. These facades car- ried the sculpture on which so much of the follow- ing interpretation is based. Although Fash pres- ents a detailed reconstruction of these facades in Chapter 2, it should be noted that almost from the first day of excavation we recognized we were dealing with a heavily decorated building. Dozens of pieces of sculpture that clearly had fallen from the building were recovered from the terrace, stairway, and plaza to the north of the central superstructure. Fash found many addi- tional pieces fallen from the rear wall. All of these were carefully recorded according to the proce- dures he outlines in Chapter 2, thus facilitating the eventual reconstruction. As was our practice in all the excavations at Las Sepulturas, we stripped off, as separate excava- tion units, thin layers of debris from immediately 25</page><page sequence="30">Fig. 12 East end of Room i, Structure 9N-82 center. The articulation of the Hieroglyphic Bench with the east wall of the room is evident, as is the blocked doorway leading into Room 5. over the floors and benches, hoping to find fea- tures or artifacts associated with them. With the exception of a single burial, few such artifacts or features were encountered (only sherds or obsid- ian blades). The problem in assessing the signifi- cance of such samples is that cultural debris was routinely swept up by the Maya and incorporated into the construction fill of buildings. When walls or roofs collapsed, some of this material ended up on, or just above, floors or benches, in spurious association with them (but see Table 1, p. 38, for obsidian dates from the central superstructure). The single burial - or perhaps more properly (be- cause it was not actually buried) skeleton - was found in the main room. Originally this main room of the superstructure (Room 1) was con- nected with the eastern room (Room 5) by a nar- row doorway (see Figs. 10 and 12). One stepped up through this doorway from Room 1 right onto the rear of the Room 5 bench. After the doorway had functioned for some time, it was blocked off with well-cut stone blocks, producing a little alcove-like space in the northeastern corner of Room 1 .

Later collapse buried and se- verely damaged the skeleton, but enough re- mained to show that it was primary and in a flexed position; no grave goods were associated with it. Its placement in the building must have long postdated the elite occupation of Structure 9N-82 center and could have been very recent. I would like to finish with some estimates of construction costs derived from the experimental and time-motion studies recently carried out by Abrams at Copan (Abrams n.d.). Abrams con- cluded that the whole latest phase of construction on Structure 9N-82, including the substructure ren- ovations and the erection of the sculpted and vaulted superstructure, would have required the labor of about 136 unskilled and 45 skilled laborers working for a period of some 60 days. This is cer- tainly not an excessive level of demand and could have been undertaken, as Abrams points out, even with rather simple modes of organization. The Hieroglyphic Bench The most spectacular single find in the Court- yard A complex is the hieroglyphic bench in the central room of Structure 9N-82 center (Figs. 12- 14). Inasmuch as the epigraphy and iconography of the bench are dealt with exhaustively in the following chapters, I will here restrict my com- ments to the description of its principal structural features. The bench, which was about 2.3 m wide, runs the entire length of the central room for a distance of 6.65 m, taking up the bulk of the interior space. It consists of three main elements - the ba- sal supports, the horizontal stone slabs of the bench itself, and the end plinths (Fig. 14 a, b). A raised section of the room floor underlies the whole bench, and this flooring is carried up to three courses at each end to support the plinths. The entire bench was in excellent condition when uncovered, even though part of its eastern plinth actually outcropped onto the surface of the mound before excavation. Unfortunately, the up- per section of the western plinth is missing; there was no sign of a looter's hole, so it may have been removed before the vault and upper walls collapsed, perhaps as early as Post-Classic times. Such removal would be consistent with the con- siderable relocation of sculptural elements that oc- curred commonly at Copan after the main elite collapse. Six rectangular stone supports carved with an- thropomorphic figures hold up the bench. The cen- tral four rise directly from the raised rear floor of the room; the three spaces between them are re- cessed about 40 cm. On each end of the bench is a larger support rising from the main (lower) por- tion of the room floor. The fronts of these end blocks are not flush with the front of the bench but are somewhat outset, probably to provide conve- nient steps to climb onto the surface of the bench, which is rather high (70 cm) - an interpretation supported by the wear evident on the outset upper surfaces. The main bench element is a set of huge limestone slabs laid horizontally on the supports, which underlie their joints. The front face of these slabs carries the inscription of 16 full-figure glyphs arranged along the stylized body of a two-headed celestial serpent. Finally, two raised plinths with slightly battered side surfaces rise from either end and are decorated with seated human figures. Such lateral plinths are commonly found on such benches (e.g., at Uaxactun - cf. Smith 1950). Figures 15 and 16 illustrate the sequence of glyphs in the inscription, and each glyph is shown as both a photo and a drawing. These figures should be referred to when reading Riese's analysis of the inscription in Chapter 4. All of the bench components were made of green tuff, and the quality of the sculpture is ex- tremely high. Well-surfaced plaster about 6-7 cm thick with traces of red paint covered the whole bench surface, and a thin coating (ca. 0.25 cm) of robin's-egg blue plaster originally covered the carvings. The bench dominates the central room and was clearly an integral part of its construc- tion. Because of its excellent preservation, we did not excavate the fill of the bench to determine whether it contained caches or burials as have been found at other Maya centers (Smith 1950). Rudi Larios, the project restorer, subsequently dis- mantled the entire bench for removal to the new 30</page><page sequence="35">museum and found no burials or caches during the process. Benches are, of course, found commonly in Classic Lowland Maya sites (especially in the Late Classic phases) and widely throughout the rest of Mesoamerica as well. Actually, there are a num- ber of architectural features that may be conceptu- alized as benches, and these often are called by specialized terms. What may be the most elabo- rate version of the bench occurs generally in build- ings that have front and rear rooms. Here the whole rear partition is elevated above the front floor surface, forming an interior raised platform. Haviland (n.d.) encountered such features at Tikal, and examples are also found at Copan. In Structure 22 (Fig. 6), which, as I have previously indicated, may be a royal palace rather than a temple, the main central room is such a platform, and a similar arrangement occurs in the recently reconstructed Temple 18 and in Temple 11. Another term, altar , is used to denote a special type of raised platform found in (presumably) reli- gious structures and used for religious rituals (Smith 1950: 78). In this case the platform is rect- angular and juts out from the rear wall of the room with three freestanding sides. Such an ar- rangement may be seen on the summit of Struc- ture 80 (Fig. 7). The term bench in its most restricted use refers to a variety of raised platforms. Most commonly, benches are rectangular and run along the rear wall of a room, with the ends of the bench abut- ting the side walls. Variations include benches along side walls, L-shaped benches, and C-shaped benches. Such benches are usually assumed to have served as sitting or sleeping spaces (e.g., Ad- ams 1970, 1977), but, as Smith (1950: 78) ob- serves, the distinction between benches and altars is often difficult to make. At Copan, as at other Maya centers, benches are encountered in structures of all kinds and on all social levels. A glance at Figure 5 shows how ubiquitous they are in Group 9N-8. They are clearly important interior features even in domes- tic households of commoners in the urban zone, although they appear rarely in the small rural sites we have dug outside the Copan pocket. An inter- esting question is, in fact, whether the various benches, platforms, or altars so frequently associ- ated with elite or civic architecture are not elabora- tions of the simple benches that originally served mundane domestic purposes only in many simple houses. Quite apart from their actual presence in exca- vated buildings, benches of various kinds are often portrayed in Maya art - particularly on lintel carv- ings (e.g., Lintel 3 at Piedras Negras), mural paint- ings (the Bonampak murals), and on numerous decorated polychrome vessels (e.g., Coe 1973). Such representations usually show the use of benches in elite/ceremonial contexts. At least as long ago as Satterthwaite's (1937) work on Piedras Negras, it was recognized that benches sometimes functioned as "thrones" - that is, as seats of author- ity emphasizing the social and political (and proba- bly the ritual) prestige of the occupant. Ethno- graphically, of course, the use of special seats to symbolize prestige or authority is very wide- spread, ranging from the carved benches of the basically egalitarian Ifugao to the stools denoting kingship in west Africa. A point that should be made here, anticipating Sanders' later remarks, is that although Westerners tend to equate the notion of throne with that of royalty, in non-Western cul- tures seats of authority may not be restricted to rulers alone. Although most scenes showing the use of benches as thrones seem to occur in rooms, it is likely that there were more public, or outdoor, versions as well. Satterthwaite (1937) believed that Altar 16 at Yaxchilan was an outdoor dais, and a ceramic vessel illustrated by Hohmann and Vogrin (1982: 83) shows a Maya dignitary seated on a zoomorphic altar similar to those found in the Great Plaza at Copan. Most excavated benches at Copan and else- where are plain, although some were originally painted in various colors. As shown in Maya art, however, many appear to be decorated by paint- ing or sculpture (or perhaps by having fabrics or skins laid over them). An example is pictured on Lintel 3 at Piedras Negras (Proskouriakoff 1966: 174); here the bench or throne is obviously deco- rated, but the exact manner is uncertain. 3i</page><page sequence="36">Fig. 17 Courtyard A: construction phase 1 (this drawing and Figs. 18-21 adapted by D.

Fig. 21 Courtyard A: construction phase 5. Although carved benches are known from a few other Classic Maya sites such as Palenque (see Baudez's discussion, Chapter 3) and from as far afield as Tula (if we expand our spatial and chro- nological perspectives somewhat), the hiero- glyphic bench seems to be virtually confined to Copan, although a few others are known (e.g., the throne from Palace J-6 at Piedras Negras; see Morley and Brainerd 1983: 402). Trik (1939) found such a bench in Structure 21 A, flanking the so-called "Temple of Meditation" (Fig. 6), and another was recovered from a small mound near the entrance to the Copan Archaeological Park about twenty years ago (this was probably the outdoor variety). Baudez informs me that during his recording of Copan sculpture he has found what appear to be fragments of another bench of this type. Leventhal, in his excavations of the Type 3 unit 9M-18 - only about 200 m west of Group 9N-8 - uncovered an intact hieroglyphic 33</page><page sequence="38">bench in the principal building (Willey et al. 1978). This bench shares many features with that of Structure 9N-82 center, including the side plinths (in this case uncarved); although its inscrip- tion is not well preserved, the probable date indi- cates that it was dedicated in a.d. 780, only a few years before the bench in the House of the Bacabs. Other similarities include its location (in the principal, north-facing building of the group) and the layout of the building in which it was found, which closely resembles Structure 9N-82 center in that it has a large central room and two smaller, flanking rooms entered from side door- ways (Willey et al. 1978: 34, 35). This kind of room layout is common in elite buildings at Copan, and is seen in an elaborated form in Struc- ture 22 of the Main Group, which, remember, is possibly a royal palace. The main (rear) room of Temple 22, as pointed out earlier, consists essen- tially of a huge, raised, bench-like platform, the front of which is elaborately carved. Although hieroglyphic benches are certainly not found in all Type 3 and 4 groups (e.g., there is none in the complex Group 9M-22a, which we excavated in 1981), there is a good possibility that future excavations will turn up additional ones. Where they do occur, they obviously are signifi- cant elite markers and, along with fagade sculp- ture, may be characteristic of the reign of Rising Sun, the last ruler of Copan. One other elite monument of considerable im- portance may have come from Courtyard A, and certainly came from its general vicinity. This is Altar W', which Morley recovered from an un- known location near the end of the Las Sepulturas causeway (Morley 1920: 330-334; see Fig. 83 be- low for an illustration of Altar W'). Unfortu- nately, Morley lacked an adequate map of the outlying groups on which to record his find, but, based on his comments and the existing photos of Altar W' in its original position, Courtyard A is its probable site. If Morley read the erection date (a.d. 27 Dec. 775) of Altar W' correctly, the monument pre- dates the dedication of the sculptured bench in Courtyard A and is further testimony to the im- portance of the occupant of the House of the Bacabs during the reign of Rising Sun. Altar W' closely resembles the bench in its use of elaborate full-figure glyphs and, as Morley (1920: 233-234) notes, in the superb quality of its carving. For a more detailed discussion of this monument and its possible implications, see the Appendix. Relative Construction Phasing of the Courtyard A Complex Clues to the function of Maya architectural units may be derived from the processes of growth and change they exhibit. Although, with- out tearing the buildings apart, details of such changes remain uncertain, we can reconstruct the main outlines of the evolution of the Courtyard A complex. The following brief description is mainly based on the deep trenching of Fash and Abrams, and particularly on Fash's section of the preliminary report, from which the drawings are also taken. The Courtyard A excavations demonstrate that use of the area - although not necessarily for do- mestic purposes - probably extends back as far as about 900-1000 B.C., or the Early Pre-Classic/ Middle Pre-Classic transition. Except for the Late Pre-Classic hiatus that characterizes most of the Copan Valley, there is at least intermittent activ- ity in the vicinity thereafter right up till the Late Classic period, when, of course, the heaviest occu- pation occurs. The details of this series of earlier occupations are irrelevant for the present discus- sion; what is important is that, as we anticipated for the socially dominant Type 4 units, there is great time depth evident, suggesting that the gen- eral vicinity had long been significant in social, political, and economic terms. We are concerned here with the evolution of the Late Classic/Early Post-Classic complex, espe- cially those buildings related to the last plaza floor (Plaza Floor 1); these are summarized in Figures 17-21, which should be consulted while reading the verbal description. During the first construction phase of interest there were at least three structures grouped around the courtyard (Fig. 17). On the north and south were the interior buildings found in trench- ing the latest phases of Structures 80 and 82. On 34</page><page sequence="39">the west, Structure 81 stood in the form in which we found it, but, at this point, it was a free- standing building lacking its southern terrace. Traces of an early construction in the southwest corner of the plaza (not shown) were also found. In this phase, structures were not conjoined. It is possible that there was a building along the east- ern side of the plaza in use at this time, but we cannot be certain of this. Sometime later the original buildings of Struc- tures 80 and 82 center were renovated and en- larged, assuming their final forms (Fig. 18). Judg- ing from the dedication date on the bench, this must have been before or about a.d. 787. It is possible that Structure 83 was built at about the same time; if this is so, the courtyard possessed all its major components, though they were not yet linked together. Next came the L-shaped connection shutting off the plaza on the southwest, which included the superstructure just to the south of the original Structure 81 superstructure (Fig. 19). Eventually a further drastic modification took place in this area. The L-shaped platform was heightened, ef- fectively burying the second building erected on Structure 81, producing the flat terrace and associ- ated features we later discovered (Fig. 20). More important, the western superstructure of Struc- ture 82 was built, as was the set of wide terraces along the western flank of Structure 81. Note that the stairways of Structure 81 and the expanded Structure 82 were joined at this time. In the next phase, the eastern substructure and superstructure were added to the Structure 82 complex (Fig. 21). If, as I indicated earlier, Struc- ture 83 had been built before this, the building effort effectively shut off access to the courtyard from the south (except for the small southeastern stairway, which was certainly a product of this phase), and the front stairways of Structures 82 and 83 were joined. There remains the unlikely possibility that Structure 83 and the eastern lateral extension of Structure 82 were constructed at the same time - that is, that for a long time there was only a small building on the east and that Struc- ture 83 is quite late. Perhaps the little back room on the upper west terrace of Structure 83 was built at this time as well. At any rate, the court- yard now included all of its essential components, although minor modifications continued, such as the construction of the corridor rooms between the central and western superstructures of Struc- ture 82 (Fig. 21). Absolute Chronology and the Courtyard A Complex Although the relative sequence of major con- struction can be worked out for the Courtyard A complex, it is imperative to examine the evidence for absolute dating in order to develop a proper interpretive framework. Available evidence from which inferences about absolute chronology may be made include ceramics, inscriptions, radiocar- bon dates, and obsidian hydration dates. The fol- lowing discussion treats only the late construction episodes - those closely associated in time with the House of the Bacabs - and ignores the deeper Early/Middle Classic and Pre-Classic deposits. The most crucial evidence is based upon the ceramic assemblages associated with the various buildings. Although all of the excavated struc- tures contain traces of early ceramics in their fill, the bulk of the collections from most contexts relates to the Coner ceramic phase, assumed at the time of our excavations to date to the Late and Terminal Classic periods. Viel (1983) dis- cusses the procedures by which he generated the ceramic sequence shown in Figure 2. For our pur- poses it is essential to recognize only that the in- ception of the Coner phase, marked principally by the appearance of the distinctive Copador polychrome types and the enormous proliferation of Casaca Striated utilitarian ware, is well estab- lished on a variety of grounds (including associa- tions with dated monuments in the Main Group) at about a.d. 700. The last dated inscription in the Main Group is a.d. 800, so the collapse of the royal establishment at Copan must have occurred at or shortly after this time. It was originally as- sumed that there was a rapid overall demographic decline associated with the royal collapse, and con- sequently that the Coner ceramic phase ended about this time as well. In his 1983 summary, Viel extended the Coner phase to a.d. 850 to 35</page><page sequence="40">allow for a gradual depopulation. During my dis- cussions with him in 1984, he was inclined to extend the phase still another fifty years, and I have accordingly shown a terminus at a.d. 900 in the chart (Fig. 2). Subsequent to the Coner phase, Viel identified a fugitive Early Post-Classic phase called Ejar on the basis of small samples of late, in- trusive ceramic types - notably Tohil Plumbate - which are found in scattered contexts at Copan, particularly in the Main Group. He suggests that the Ejar phase falls between a.d. 900-1200. The main chronological issues, to which we will re- turn in a moment, are not the beginning of the Coner phase, but rather its duration, as well as the nature of the Early Post-Classic ceramic as- semblage (Early Post-Classic here meaning post- A.D. 800). Turning now to another class of evidence - inscriptions - we know that the House of the Bacabs in its final configuration dates to the reign of Rising Sun (see Riese, Chapter 4), which falls between a.d. 762 and 800. Fortu- nately, the hieroglyphic bench in the central room of the House of the Bacabs has a date of a.d. 787, squarely in the middle of Rising Sun's reign. It is a reasonable assumption that the event referred to by this date included the dedica- tion of the bench and the renovation of the struc- ture of which it is an integral component. The year date on Altar W' (if it did indeed come from Courtyard A) - a.d. 775 - also fits nicely into Rising Sun's reign (but see the extended dis- cussion of this monument in the Appendix). We currently have only one radiocarbon date from the Courtyard A complex. This derives from a piece of charred wood found on the floor of Structure 81, which, it will be remembered, appears to have burned down. This date is a.d 700 ±50 (SMU# 1805). At first glance, this date appears to be too early. Certainly the structure, which is associated with Coner ceramics, cannot have been erected much before a.d. 700, al- though it does seem to be one of the earliest struc- tures in Courtyard A. Nor is it likely that such an important building was destroyed at ca. a.d. 700-750 and then remained unreconstructed even as the rest of the group experienced extensive growth. Actually the date is quite acceptable for two reasons. First, although we do not yet understand the reasons, virtually all of our radiocarbon dates for Copan are distorted in the sense that they read too early (and this includes dates from the previ- ous Willey/Baudez projects). The problem is espe- cially severe for Pre-Classic dates, which may be as much as a millennium earlier than expected, but late dates are also affected to some lesser de- gree. In all likelihood, in other words, this date should really read somewhere in the late eighth century. More significantly, it must be remembered that the date pertains to the age of the wood itself - presumably a small sapling used in the original construction of the building - not the date of the fire that destroyed Structure 81. If Structure 81 had been erected sometime in the early or middle decades of the eighth century, as we believe, then this date falls just about where it should. It seems, then, that the process of growth dis- cussed above, up until the erection of the House of the Bacabs, can be placed with some confi- dence between a.d. 700 and 787. During this time the fortunes of the elite group residing there improved markedly, judging from its increased access to labor for building projects, its need for new or additional facilities, and the ability of at least one of its members - the occupant of the House of the Bacabs - to display impressive status symbols and official titles. The crucial issue is the sequence of events thereafter. As we have seen, several significant construc- tions and renovations postdate the House of the Bacabs. These include the east and west super- structures (along with their associated platforms) of Structure 82 itself, the superimposed construc- tions at the southern end of Structure 81 (which eventually link it to the west superstructure), and possibly the final phase of Structure 83. Various small-scale modifications also occurred after these buildings had been in use for some time, such as the construction of the corridor rooms. There are two basic scenarios for what happens after a.d. 787, and here some adequate control of absolute chronology is essential. The first sce- nario is the traditional one implied by Viel's origi- nal ceramic chronology. It would equate the po- 36</page><page sequence="41">litical collapse of the Copan royalty in the Main Group with a general elite collapse at about a.d. 800, with a continued, but declining population in groups such as 9N-8 for a further 50 to 100 years. According to this reconstruction, there should be virtually no population in the area sub- sequent to ca. a.d. 900. Another implication is that all of the large-scale construction in Court- yard A, which postdates a.d. 787, would have to be squeezed into a period of about thirteen years immediately preceding the elite collapse at the end of the eighth century. The second scenario postulates a much more gradual sequence of events - one in which the col- lapse of the royal center implies neither the coinci- dent disruption of all elite activity nor a rapid depopulation of the Copan Valley (and here even 50-100 years is considered to be rapid). Accord- ing to this scenario, we might expect continued activity in second-level elite centers, and much of what we recovered in Courtyard A in terms of features, middens, artifacts, etc. would date to this protracted Post-Classic (again in the sense of post-8oo) presence. A related implication is that most or all of the ceramic markers on the basis of which Viel identified the Late Classic Coner phase extend well into time periods that he consid- ers Post-Classic. As previously discussed, we have good reason to believe that much of the evolution of Group 9N-8 as a whole is late and that there was consid- erable activity there well after a.d. 800. Other excavated groups nearby, including the elite Type 3 unit 9M-22A, show convincing evidence of growth and use dating well into the ninth century or later. Fortunately, these conclusions derived from architectural stratigraphy have been con- firmed recently by a final category of chronologi- cal control - obsidian hydration dating. One of our graduate students, AnnCorinne Freter, recently completed an ambitious obsidian hydration dating project, generating 1530 dates for a wide variety of archaeological contexts throughout the Copan drainage. Despite its prom- ise, this dating technique has often not lived up to its expectations in Mesoamerica. For many rea- sons we cannot go into here, however, it is work- ing extremely well at Copan. Two general impli- cations of Freter's overall study are germane to our chronological problem. First, we know that no matter how abrupt the royal collapse may have been, there was no associated demographic collapse, but rather a slow decline lasting three or four centuries after a.d. 800. Much of the valley is still occupied at a.d. 1000-1100, and a few dates fall as late as a.d. 1 150-1200. Most signifi- cantly, these late dates are still associated with a ceramic complex that is in its essentials Coner, in the sense that all of the Coner ceramic markers are still present (there may be small shifts in some formal attributes or relative frequencies of types). Clearly, the Coner phase as Viel defined it is much longer than expected, and the Early Post- Classic markers he used to define the Ejar phase really appear in an overall ceramic context still dominated by Coner types. Thus there is no obvi- ous Late Classic/Post-Classic ceramic disjunction at Copan, even if the obsidian dates are reliable only in general terms (and they appear to be ex- tremely reliable given independent chronological checks). More to the point for our purposes is that the obsidian hydration dates indicate considerable ac- tivity in elite groups well after a.d. 800. Appar- ently the royal debacle did not completely under- mine the authority of other high-status groups or individuals, and the Copan polity remained a stratified (or perhaps ranked) one despite the ef- fective disintegration of overall political cen- tralization (see the discussion in the Appendix for some of the implications of this process of devolution). We currently have no obsidian dates for Court- yard A as a whole, 3 3 of which relate to the final construction phases of interest here. Unfortu- nately, none of the dates comes from the fill of the buildings that postdate the House of the Bacabs - the best evidence for the time of con- struction. But we do have good dates associated with the latest plaza floors, terraces, and room floors on Structures 81, 82, and 83, and all of the middens and large artifact concentrations men- tioned in the description of the Courtyard A group. These dates are summarized in Table 1 (each date has an experimentally determined error factor of ± 70 years) . 37</page><page sequence="42">Table i.

We are currently conducting thermal cell experiments to provide an independent rate. While the relative spread of dates used here will not change, it is conceivable that there will be some fine adjustment of the dates in absolute terms in the future. The dates as given, however, do align very well with available independent chronological determinations based upon inscriptions, architectural stratigraphy, paleomagnetic dates, and some of our radiocarbon dates, as well as ceramic associations. Several of these dates deserve detailed com- ment. Structure 80 could not have been built be- fore the last-dated obsidian artifact recovered from its fill - a.d. 716. It will be remembered that we estimated its construction to date from the early to middle decades of the eighth century (and this estimate was made before the obsidian dates were available); clearly, the fill dates support this interpretation. Dates from our best contexts - the middens associated with Structure 83 - mainly fall in the tenth century, with two slightly later. Mate- rial dropped casually in the center of the plaza is mainly early-middle eleventh century. Floor and bench dates from the central superstructure indi- cate continued use through the late ninth and early tenth centuries, and we know that the obsid- ian artifacts that yielded these dates cannot have fallen from the fill of roof or walls for they are much too late. The only really anomalous date (969) comes from the floor of Structure 8 1 . As we have seen, this was a fairly flimsy structure, built about the same time as Structure 80 (mid-eighth century), and eventually burned down. If we ac- cept the a.d. 969 obsidian date and the associated radiocarbon date previously discussed at face value, the structure would have stood intact for about two hundred years. Although this longev- ity is not impossible, it is extremely unlikely. In all probability, the blade fragment from the floor of Structure 81 is somehow intrusive, or its hydra- tion rim has been altered by burning. The pattern of dates is interesting in part for what it does not show. Abundant evidence sug- gests that the major growth of the Courtyard A complex took place during the full Late Classic period from ca. a.d. 700 to 800. Yet there is only one non-fill date from this century (from Room 3, Structure 83). Our impression has always been that household compounds were continually cleaned and swept while they were occupied, and this would be particularly true of elite courtyard groups in the urban core where refuse was in constant demand for construction fill. This inter- pretation is reinforced by the general lateness of the dates from Courtyard A; presumably they rep- resent the last stages of substantial occupation. The overall pattern of the obsidian dates clearly indicates intense domestic activity in the court- yard between a.d. 800 and 1000 and strongly sug- gests that major construction activity continued throughout the ninth century. Some dates run into the eleventh and twelfth centuries, indicating a slow process of ultimate abandonment. What we seem to have here, at least up until ca. a.d. iooo, is not squatters utilizing an abandoned elite complex, as is so often found at other Lowland Maya cen- ters, but rather a continuation of elite residential functions. We cannot even be sure that the prestige 38</page><page sequence="43">and power of the resident elite group was on the wane throughout the ninth century; indeed, such powerful second-level elites may have been instru- mental in displacing the Copan royal lineage, thereby possibly even augmenting their own politi- cal authority for some time thereafter. Someone skeptical of the idea that the Coner ceramic phase extends so far into the Early Post- Classic period could legitimately ask, at this point, whether our obsidian hydration rates might not be wrong, and whether the dates for Courtyard A (and other similar contexts not dis- cussed here) might not simply be reading about two centuries late because of miscalculation. In other words, what would happen if one assumed that our collection of obsidian dates was inter- nally consistent, in relative terms, but too late in absolute alignment? I cannot defend here the methodology of establishing the hydration rates utilized, but I would like to point out that the effect of simply pushing our sequence of dates back in time by two centuries or more would cause an even more violent disruption of the tradi- tional Copan ceramic chronology. Available hy- dration dates strongly confirm the traditional be- ginning date for the Coner phase at about a.d. 700; the inception of the phase around this time is, of course, firmly tied into the architectural stratigraphy and dated monuments of the Main Group. To realign the whole obsidian sequence as suggested above would do great violence to the most secure parts of the Copan chronology as shown in Figure 2. This review of the absolute chronology of the Courtyard A group helps us to understand the significance of many of the processes of its growth, decline, and also its function. Especially important in the latter regard is that the midden debris and other artifactual material associated with the latest living surfaces, while generally not of Late Classic date, show that a variety of resi- dential functions, including food preparation, were carried out there, and probably represent continuities with the full Classic occupation of the group. In other words, this palace complex has all the expected earmarks of an elite residential zone, even though we have recovered only the latest traces of such activity. On a more general level, obsidian hydration dating provided an invaluable adjunct to other chronological controls and a level of precision not available on the basis of building stratigraphy, artifact associations, radiocarbon dates, or even inscriptions. It clearly demon- strates, when used in conjunction with these other independent chronological measures, that at Copan at least, the "Classic collapse" is a much more protracted and complex affair, both politi- cally and demographically, than Maya archaeolo- gists have usually imagined. No matter how sud- den the political collapse of the royal line at the Main Group may have been, evidence from Courtyard A and many other contexts demon- strates the durability of second-level elites for a long time thereafter. Summary In summary, the original assumption made by Willey and his colleagues that the courtyard groups of the urban core at Copan were largely residential in function has been borne out by our excavations in Group 9N-8 in general, and in Courtyard A in particular. Structure 9N-82 cen- ter, the House of the Bacabs, is the centerpiece of the whole Group 9N-8, and may be appropriately regarded as both an elaborate household, on one level, and a ritual and administrative establish- ment on another, dominated by the elite residents of Courtyard A. Such a pattern, in which politi- cal administration is essentially an extension of household administration, may have been wide- spread in prehistoric Mesoamerica; see, for exam- ple, Robert Carmack's (1981) discussion of ranked lineages and "Big House" organization among the ethnohistorically known Quiche of the Guatemalan highlands. Let us turn to yet another ethnographic source, Hernan Cortes' account of elite houses in early sixteenth-century Yucatan: There are houses belonging to certain men of rank which are very cool and have many rooms, for we have seen as many as five courtyards in a single house, and the rooms around them very well laid out, each man having a private room. Inside there 39</page><page sequence="44">are also wells and water tanks and rooms for slaves and servants of which they have many. Each of these chieftains has in front of the entrance to his house a very large courtyard and some two or three or four of them raised up high with steps up to them and all are very well built. (Cortes 1971 : 31) This account, aside from the facilities for water, which would certainly not have been necessary at Copan, is extraordinarily congruent with our data from Group 9N-8 and Courtyard A, and further supports our household model. Although the general area of Group 9N-8 and Courtyard A had a long history of use, it was not until Coner times that massive masonry struc- tures were erected in large numbers, some vaulted and heavily decorated. Courtyard A expe- rienced growth through the eighth century, culmi- nating in an unprecedented burst of construction during the reign of Rising Sun; this was paralleled elsewhere in the group, and activity, at least partly of an elite character, continued for a consid- erable time after the royal collapse at the Main Group. 40</page><page sequence="45">CHAPTER 2 The Sculptural Fagade of Structure 9N-82: Content, Form, and Significance William L. Fash, Jr. Documentation and Reconstruction of the 9N-82 Facade The excavation of Structure 9N-82 was an impor- tant and timely one in the history of Copan ar- chaeology. It represented an opportunity to com- bine the methods and theory of anthropological archaeology with the data derived from the study of the historical record and religious symbols of the Classic Maya ideological system as inter- preted by epigraphers and iconographers. It also provided us with the best-preserved example yet encountered for studying the form and layout of fagade sculpture from a single building. Such in- formation once existed for the temples in the Main Acropolis at Copan, but unfortunately, at the time these temples were excavated, archaeo- logical methodologies were not keyed to the pre- cise location of all the fallen architectural and sculptural blocks that were being uncovered. The excavation methodology we employed during our investigation of Structure 9N-82 has enabled us to go beyond iriere speculation to actual dem- onstration of how sculptural motifs were ar- ranged on one eighth-century Copan vaulted ma- sonry structure. These methodological advances and the information they provide for the study of this and other sculpture-adorned buildings at Copan are the subject of this chapter. During the 1980-81 season, while clearing the front steps of Structure 9N-82 and the adjacent sectors of the plaza floor, numerous tenoned sculptural fragments were uncovered by David Webster and Elliot Abrams. It soon became appar- ent that the entire area in front of the central su- perstructure of Structure 82 was littered with such fragments, presumably fallen from the front facade of the building. In order to facilitate the study and hypothetical reconstruction of this fa- cade, Webster and Abrams recorded the precise horizontal and vertical positions of these pieces from the north side as they were encountered. The center of each fallen fragment was then plot- ted on a 1:40 scale map of Plaza A, and each piece was subsequently photographed and catalogued in the laboratory. During the 1982 excavations of the south side of Structure 82, I followed a slightly modified procedure. Sculptural pieces were individually plan-mapped to give an idea of the manner in which they had fallen, and the pieces were left in place during the excavations for both mapping and photographing. Once the precise three- dimensional references for all of the fallen frag- ments had been made, the hypothetical reconstruc- tion of the facade could then be undertaken on a secure footing. The resulting distribution map is reproduced here as Figure 22. This map includes only those fragments that are clearly sculptural pieces associ- ated with the facade of the central superstructure 4i</page><page sequence="46">Fig. 22 Plan map showing distribution of sculptural fagade fragments fallen from Structure 9N-82 1st. of Structure 82. Numerous architectural pieces (cordholders, stones with hollows in one corner, etc.) and some sculptures associated with the much simpler facades of Structures 80, 81, and 83 were also dutifully recorded, but do not enter into consideration here. During the excavation of the north side of Structure 82, two areas q{ concentration of sculp- ture were noted: the plaza floor and steps adjacent to the lower stairway and the top of the substruc- ture in front of the central superstructure. In the latter area there were particularly dense concentra- tions of fragments on either side of the central doorway, flush against the north superstructure wall, and also in front of the doorway itself. It was subsequently discovered that there were two courses of an identical facade motif still in situ on either side of the central doorway. These motifs seemed to form the lower borders of two niches, into which were set another kind of sculpture. It became clear that most of the fragments found in front of these niches pertained originally to them. Based on the assumption that there were three units of sculpture on the north facade of Structure 82, Elliot Abrams proposed a tentative reconstruc- tion drawing. The discussion in the article by Webster and Abrams (1983: 290-291) is based on this reconstruction, though the drawing they re- produce as Figure 7 is modeled on the present reconstruction. On the south side of the central superstructure, the back substructure wall consisted of two verti- cal wall faces, with the upper one slightly inset. All of the fagade fragments had fallen beyond the limits of the building and lay at the base of the wall. Three very clear groupings were discerned, corresponding to the bases of the east, central, and western sectors of the central superstructure. Subsequent study of the washed and catalogued fragments showed that each of these three groups formed a coherent body of sculpture, the content of which was homogeneous in its overall design, motif, and execution. These discoveries made it possible to develop a more satisfactory reconstruction of the north fa- cade. This reconstruction posits five, rather than three, units of sculpture on the north facade, three on the south facade, and one each on the east and 42</page><page sequence="47">Fig. 23 Plan map showing distribution of fallen sculp- tural facade fragments, south facade, eastern figure. west facades of the central superstructure. Rudi Larios V., the architectural restorer of the Phase II Copan project, was a consistent constructive critic of my hypothetical reconstructions and gave me the impetus to back up my ideas with struc- tural evidence; I tested the actual fit of the frag- ments in an oversized sandbox that I had built for this purpose. Because the south facade fragments and reconstruction are basic to the overall interpre- tation, this material will be examined in detail first. Hypothetical Reconstruction of the South Facade Sculpture Of the three groups of fragments found south of the back substructure wall, the eastern one was both the first to be located and the most complete (Fig. 23). Here a fragment of a human-head bust and another piece with crossed legs were found first, indicating that an almost life-size human fig- ure formed part of the design (Fig. 24). Thereaf- ter, numerous feather pieces, a deity head, and the remaining body parts of the human figure were uncovered in an area of ca. 2 m2 (Fig. 25). Another design motif, this one similar to that on the bases of the niches on the north side, was also found. It was obvious from a structural stand- point that this element should be placed beneath the human figure (Fig. 26). This basal element was notable for the length of the tenons of its constituent stones and their relatively tight cluster- ing close to the substructure wall. The excavations demonstrated that in the cen- tral group of sculptural fragments, the same basal element was found still in order, except for one missing stone. Here again, these basal fragments were closer to the building than were the other motifs. In this instance they were also found adja- cent to a still-in-order section of the medial mold- ing of the superstructure, which had obviously collapsed at the same time. This discovery 43</page><page sequence="48">Fig. 24 Fallen sculptural frag- ments from the south facade, eastern figure. Fig. 25 Fallen sculptural fragments from the south facade, eastern figure. 44</page><page sequence="49">Fig. 26 Rearticulated sculptural elements of the lateral figures. Fig. 27 Reconstruction of the south facade, eastern fig- ure (drawing by Barbara W. Fash). showed that the sculpture was originally inset into the upper register (entablature) of the facade, just above the medial molding. The position and order of these fallen elements in archaeological context showed that they formed a base or throne, upon which was seated, cross-legged or in tailor-fashion, a human figure. The western group was the most tightly clus- tered of the three, and almost as complete as that of the eastern group. Again, the base or throne, a human figure shown seated cross-legged (but lack- ing its head), and a plumed headdress were all represented among the fragments, indicating that the elements and composition of the three groups were, in fact, quite similar. The eastern group is the most complete unit of sculpture of all four facades of the central super- structure. Based on analogy with the basal motifs still in situ in the lower register of the north facade and on the clear case of the central figure on the south facade entablature, we can confidently place the basal motif at the bottom of the composition (Figs. 27, 28). In this case the base is complete, Fig. 28 Sandbox reconstruction of the south facade, eastern figure. 45</page><page sequence="50">consisting of seven stones in two courses, the whole measuring 1.26 m across and 32 cm high. The lower course contains two recesses or niches, framed by outset sections, like the basal motifs under the north niches. This basal element is iden- tified by Baudez (Chapter 3) as a decorated form of the T23 glyph. Following Knorosov and oth- ers, he reads the element as na (house). Seated cross-legged on this na glyph base is the human figure, consisting of six stones in four sec- tions or courses of unequal height. The body is complete, except that the right bust segment is represented only by the fingers, the rest appar- ently having been removed by stone scavengers. The figure wears a loincloth, with a plain front flap but having a belt decorated by two rows of beads. The beads of the upper row are elongated and either flat or tubular, while the lower beads are round. The left wrist wears a bracelet com- posed of long plaques or tubular beads (the right wrist is missing), and on his chest the figure wears a necklace with six rows of round or rectan- gular beads. The arm is partly independent of the bust but is proportionally too small for the body. The face is less than perfectly rendered, with a defective right eye (possibly corrected by a plaster coating) and a slightly crooked aspect. The rounded earspools are also slightly askew, and a beaded headband or diadem is depicted on the forehead. In the reconstruction drawing and pho- tograph, allowance was made for a 4 cm-high neck piece, because such pieces were found with three of the other facade figures. Five tiers of feathers are represented on the headdress of the east figure. Reconstructing the original layout of the feathers was facilitated by the manner in which the stones had been carved. The lines of feathers continue through two or three courses. Thus the spines and edges of the feathers serve as guides for matching up the blocks. Contrary to the case of the Puuc build- ings, where the pieces of sculptural facade were carved individually a priori and assembled on the building thereafter, the 9N-82 facade stones were obviously carved after the blocks had been assem- bled. This carving could have taken place on the Fig. 29 Restored feather headdress from the eastern inner niche figure of Temple 18. 46</page><page sequence="51">ground (using some equivalent to a sandbox) be- fore assembly on the facade, or the blocks simply could have been carved once they were in place on the building itself. The uniting of the four groups of feathers in the fashion shown in Figure 28 is based on analogy with the in situ feather headdresses of Temple 18 (Fig. 29), which is close in date of construction to Structure 9N-82 (Baudez and Dowd 1983). A space is shown be- tween the extant fragments of the uppermost course in this headdress, based on analogy with the more complete examples of the upper course found with three of the other figures. The position and order of the two central ele- ments of the headdress are also supported by structural evidence. These elements comprise a long-snouted deity head, with a maize cob sprout- ing from its forehead. These same two elements were also found with the west figure on the north side, and the maize element was found with the west figure on the south side and the east figure on the north side. None of these elements was found with the central figure of either the north or south side, whose headdresses were distinc- tively different from the others. Clearly, then, the long-snouted deity sprouting maize pertains only to the lateral figures on both the north and south facades. The fitting of the central headdress pieces them- selves demonstrates their vertical order. The deity head is rounded and as such fits directly on top of the figure's head. This position is iconographi- cally logical as well, for it is represented in numer- ous other Copan sculptures (e.g., Stelae C, F, I, M, N, P, Altar T top). The maize element fits perfectly atop the deity head, with its lower cen- tral element the same width as the uppermost forehead element of the deity head. Also, the ends of the carved areas on the sides of the deity's head and the maize element match perfectly, as does the length of their tenons. The other element found consistently with the side figures on both the north and south facades is a feathered dais. On the south facade, this compo- nent was found with the figures on the east and west; on the north facade, it is associated with the west figure. Such pillows are common features on polychrome ceramics of the Late Classic pe- riod (a stone version can be seen in the Nunnery of Uxmal). The underside of this feather piece has a small rectangular projection that matches perfectly the loincloth of the figure seated atop it (Figs. 26, 27). The dais, two of the base pieces, and four of the feather pieces contain remnants of stucco plas- ter up to 1.3 cm thick (Fig. 28). Thus the sculp- tural pieces, like the walls of which they formed a part, were completely coated with plaster in their original state. No traces of paint were detected in the stucco remnants, but the original surface was badly weathered. Structural evidence for the position and depth of relief of the upper-register facade figures is present in several forms. First, the base of the central fig- ure had fallen in a single, well-arranged section (face down) just south of the stones comprising the medial molding (Figs. 30, 31). This molding was remarkable for the outstanding length of the ten- ons of its constituent stones, some of which were Fig. 30 Plan map showing distribution of the fallen sculptural fragments of the south facade, central figure. 47</page><page sequence="52">Fig. 31 Medial molding of the superstructure, as found fallen in back of the central part of the south wall of Structure 9N-82 1st. The sculptural fragments of the base of the central figure were found just south of the molding. 60 cm or longer. Here an entire section of the up- per superstructure wall seems to have collapsed together and fallen clear of the substructure. The fact that the base of the sculpture component was found immediately adjacent to the still ordered stones of the medial molding demonstrates that the base was originally assembled directly atop the molding. This positioning would explain why the tenons of the base were notably longer than those of the figure and his headdress; that is, the face of the base was set flush with that of the medial mold- ing, which was outset (5-10 cm) from the plane of the upper facade of the building. The body and central elements of the headdress were outset to the same degree from the plane of the wall, whereas the feather blocks (which, unlike the above, were not smoothed on the sides) were laid in very nearly the same plane as the remainder of the upper facade wall. The form of the base of the central figure on the south facade duplicates that of the east figure; it is the same height, length, and width as the latter. As with the east figure, both its arms are disproportionately small, and both were placed on the chest, making gestures whose meaning is to us unknown. Again, six rows of beads are depicted on the necklace, and both wrists wear long plaque or tubular bead bracelets. In the case of this central figure, however, nei- ther the human body nor the headdress was found complete. This deficiency is at least partly the result of modern stone-scavenging activities. In June 1985, I discovered half of the bust, half of the legs/loincloth assemblage, and two headdress fragments from this central figure of the south facade (and others from the east and west facade figures) in a pile of sculptural fragments collected from the site in the early 1970s. Juan Sandoval informed us that he had collected these fragments in response to local reports of the discovery of esculturas bonitas by a work gang collecting dressed masonry blocks for modern construction. 48</page><page sequence="53">Fig. 32 Sandbox reconstruction of the south facade, central figure. These pieces of the central figure from the south facade had fallen farther from the building at the time the vault collapsed, and thus, of the three sculpture groups, were the most superficial and most easily collected. The reconstructed form of the east figure head- dress was used to predict the placement of the fragments of that of the central figure (Fig. 32). Note that the uppermost tier has a 40-cm wide central area with a smooth surface and no feath- ers. The three blocks shown in the uppermost tier irrefutably go together because of their unique height (13 cm vs. 18 cm for all the other tiers) and fit and because they have burn marks that carry over from one piece to the next. The only compo- nent of the central headdress motifs remaining on this figure is a trilobal sign ringed with dots or beads. Judging from the carving on its sides, this element was made to stand out some distance from the rest (Fig. 33). The same element is shown in high relief on the headdress of the cen- tral figure on the north side and, based on its position there, was placed in the uppermost part of this central headdress (see the reconstruction 49</page><page sequence="54">Fig. 33 Central headdress element found with the cen- tral figure, south facade. Fig. 34 Central headdress element found with the cen- tral figure, south facade. Fig. 35 Reconstruction drawing of the south facade, western figure. shown in Fig. 32). Another element, shown in Figure 34, probably was incorporated into this headdress, for reasons discussed later. The west figure of the south side is nearly as complete as the eastern one (Figs. 35, 36). Here only the head of the figure, the deity head, and two major feather pieces are lacking. This figure appears to have been a virtual duplicate of the east- ern figure, insofar as its headdress, base, and body are concerned. Here also, the plaster coating is oc- casionally preserved, in one case up to 1 cm in thickness. Found among the sculptural fragments of this figure were the pieces of a long, canal- shaped roof drainstone along with its capstone (Fig. 37). The position of this drainstone, and of a capstone found with the sculptural fragments of the eastern figure, indicates that the drains were placed above the figures, probably over the trans- verse walls dividing the rooms of the superstruc- ture for greater structural strength. Farther to the west of these pieces comprising the west figure of the south facade was found another block carved Fig. 36 Sandbox reconstruction of the south facade, western figure. 50</page><page sequence="55">Fig. 37 Plan map showing the distribution of the fallen sculptural fragments of the south facade, western figure. with feathers. It is taller and shows a distinctive layout for the feathers but is, in fact, symmetrical with some other pieces that apparently adorned the western wall of the central superstructure. Based on the documentation provided above, a hypothetical reconstruction of the upper register of the south side of the central superstructure of Structure 9N-82 can be offered (Fig. 38). Note the symmetry of composition and design of the three human figures, whose bases, body postures, and feather headdresses are all of the same size and form. The only known distinguishing feature is the distinctive central, nonfeather elements of the headdress of the central figure. It is likely, however, that the heads would have been slightly different from one figure to the next, based on analogy with the north side. Fig. 38 Reconstruction of the south facade of Structure 9N-82 1st (drawing by Barbara W. Fash). 51</page><page sequence="56">Hypothetical Reconstruction of the North Fagade The Lower Register The hypothetical reconstruction of the north facade, at first a seemingly daunting task, was simplified by the discoveries on the south side. More pieces were found on the front (north) side of the building because this side had an entab- lature as well as a lower register. For the lower register, the basal elements of two sculptural mo- tifs had been found in situ on the wall on either side of the central doorway. Furthermore, a frag- ment of a human bust was found falling out in front of the central part of the eastern element. In working with the fragments from the north facade in 1981, Barbara Fash (a sculpture illustra- tor for the Proyecto Arqueologico Copan) suc- cessfully pieced together four different serpent heads. Subsequent study of the sculpture- distribution map compiled by Webster and Abrams showed that all of the fragments from two of these serpent heads had been found in front of the eastern basal element on the lower register of the facade (Fig. 39) and that eleven of those from the other two serpents had fallen in front of the corresponding western basal element (Fig. 40). The serpents were consequently inter- preted to have derived from these lower-register components. The articulation of the serpent heads with the sculpture still in situ on the building was resolved on the basis of structural evidence. Some subtle but clearly defined burn marks were present on the sculptural fragments associated with the east niche. The normally green or pinkish volcanic tuff had turned yellow, orange, and, in some ar- eas, black as a result of exposure to fire. The burn marks corresponded on adjacent pieces, showing that the fire took place while the sculpture was still set into the facade. The block containing the jaw hinge of the western serpent head had burn marks that matched not only the other head frag- ments but the westernmost blocks of the basal Fig. 39 Plan map showing distribution of sculptural fa- cade fragments fallen from the north facade, eastern niche. Fig. 40 Plan map showing distribution of sculptural fragments fallen from the north facade, western niche. 52</page><page sequence="57">Fig. 41 Reconstruction drawing of the north facade, eastern niche. Fig. 42 Split serpent head framing south entrance to inner cham- ber, Temple 11. element, which were still in situ on the building. This block (CPN 3424) fitted perfectly into the space between two stones restored in that wall by Rudi Larios, thus confirming its correct place- ment. Furthermore, it demonstrated unequivo- cally that the serpent head stood vertically, with the inside of the mouth facing to the east. As for the eastern serpent, because its jaw hinge had been found in situ and restored by Larios, it was an easy matter to show that its head also stood vertically, opening to the west (Fig. 41). Baudez (Chapter 3) notes that the serpent is shown in split fashion, like the one on the sarcophagus lid at Palenque. This same arrangement is shown on the two-headed serpent framing the south inner doorway of Copan Temple 11 (Fig. 42) and on the top of the altar at the base of the Hieroglyphic Stairway (Gordon 1902: pl. 11). On the facade of Structure 82, the split serpent framed a niche into which other elements were inset. The serpent's mandible is outset 4-5 cm from the plane of the building facade, while the plane of the tenoned (T23) base element atop which it sits is outset 6 cm further. (Owing to the uniqueness and impor- Fig. 43 The north facade, eastern niche, as restored. 53</page><page sequence="58">tance of representations of feathered serpents in art of the Classic period, one should note that the feathers from the north facade of Structure 82 definitely do not form part of the serpents' bod- ies, as proposed by Webster and Abrams [1983: 290].) For the western niche, both of the jaw hinge fragments fit perfectly into the spaces left between in situ stones restored by Larios, and the distribution and fitting of the serpent head pieces showed that they had been positioned in the same fashion as those of the eastern niche. Two bust fragments were found falling out of the eastern niche, indicating that they were set into the open jaws of the serpent. The backs of these fragments (and those from the western niche) are flat rather than tenoned, thus implying that they were simply set into the niches rather than being tenoned into the fill of the building itself. Further examination brought to light frag- ments of arms, a neck, and one hand, which were of the same slightly larger-than-life-size scale as the two nontenoned busts. Of the arm and bust fragments that came from the eastern niche (ac- cording to the distribution map), all showed burn marks, in keeping with those found on the east- ern niche itself. The hand originally projected 16 cm from the plane of the serpent's jaw, as evi- denced by the limits of the burn area (see Fig. 43). In Classic Maya art, only the upper half of any being is portrayed emerging from a serpent's jaws; in this respect the eastern niche figures are no exception, as the types of fragments and the burn marks demonstrate. The whole corpus of information - especially the burn marks - was so complete and so consis- tent that Larios saw fit to restore all the fragments of the serpent head and deity body back into the lower register of the north fagade (Figs. 43, 44). None of the facade sculptures of the upper regis- ter was restored onto the building.

Fig. 46 Head of the Pauah Tun/Scribe as found in con- struction fill. Fig. 47 Body of the Pauah Tun/ Scribe as found in con- struction fill. One motif is carried over several figures throughout Structure 82: the beaded waterlily. It appears emblazoned on the chest of each niche bust. It is shown as a necklace pendant on the full-round Pauah Tun (scribe) sculpture found in association with an earlier version of Structure 82 and, in inverted form, on the headdresses of the central figures of the upper register (Figs. 45-47). A second motif, a conch shell inkpot held in the left hand, is seen in the east niche figure as well as in that Pauah Tun sculpture. Following Coe (1973), it is clear that the complete deity is pho- netically and glyphically named by the netted cap (pauah) and cauac body markings (tun). Unfortunately, the heads of both of these fig- ures are missing. Although two sculptural human heads were found among the fragments from the north side of the building, these had long tenons 55</page><page sequence="60">and thus cannot have pertained to the nontenoned torsos (cf. the Maize God shown in Maudslay 1889-1902: pl. 17). Nonetheless, the necklace pen- dant element of both figures and the extant left hand with conch shell inkpot of the eastern one leave little doubt that at least the eastern niche figure is a representation of the Pauah Tun/ Monkey Man deity found in association with the earlier version of Structure 82. In the case of the western figure, an anomalous and unique full-round element was found among the other niche fragments. Found broken in four, this delicate element is, in fact, incomplete. It may represent some sort of headgear that adorned the head of the niche deity (Fig. 48). At each upper corner of this element is the ik sign, which is also found on the facade of Structure 9N-83 and on the Reviewing Stand, west figure. Fig. 48 Drawing of the ik motif found with the other fragments fallen from the north facade, western niche. For the western niche, we have evidence that at least some of the disturbance of the fagade sculp- ture took place before modern times. For exam- ple, a neck piece (CPN 3421) was found inside Room 5, on the eastern side of the building. An arm fragment (CPN 3475) was found on the bench of Room 1 rather than among the collapse debris in front of the western niche. These frag- ments should pertain to this western niche bust judging from the fit and lack of burn marks. Their placement implies that the western niche figure's fragments were dispersed or at least par- tially disassembled prior to the collapse of the vaulted roofs of Rooms 1 and 5. This fact recalls the unusual circumstances recorded by Webster and Abrams for the uppermost part of the west plinth of the bench of Room 1 , which was appar- ently dismantled and removed before the roof col- lapsed, but prior to modern times because no looter's pit was noted. We have already seen that the burning of the eastern niche took place before the facade col- lapsed. Indeed, the eastern figure of the upper register was also still in place as well, judging from its matching burn marks. All of this gives one the impression that the building suffered con- siderable damage at the hands of Terminal Classic or Post-Classic peoples. Perhaps in keeping with the general Mesoamerican tradition of burning temples and deities to destroy their supernatural power, the Pauah Tun deity on the east side of the building's north fagade was thoroughly burned in what must have been a blazing fire. Even the feathers on the eastern figure of the up- per register are burned, and the uppermost of these stood a full 5.5 m above the substructure terrace. At the same time or thereabouts, the west- ern plinth of the bench and the western niche figure were partially dismantled, the head and hands possibly being carried off for use else- where. Here we may note that at Copan's Ball Court B, the head of the southwest wall panel of Temple 18 was found in a Post-Classic context (Fash and Lane 1983). The Entablature The entablature (upper register) of the north facade was laid out in an identical fashion to its counterpart on the south facade, with three hu- man figures seated atop T23 (na) bases and be- decked with elaborate plumed headdresses. The distribution of the fragments bore this out fully, with clear clusters defining the western, central, and eastern figures. The fall pattern showed only a slight overlap between some of the fragments of the central figure and those of the western one (Fig. 22). By far the most complete example of the three entablature figures is the western one (Fig. 49). The base has the same dimensions and form as that of the south facade figures. The body is once again built in five tiers with the figure seated cross-legged on a feather dais. Clothing details are identical to those of the south facade figures. The face of this western figure is much more 56</page><page sequence="61">Fig. 49 Sandbox reconstruction of the north facade, western figure. finely modeled than that of the eastern figure of the south facade, and unlike the latter is framed by thin strands of hair. The earflares and beaded dia- dem on the forehead, however, are similar to those of the eastern figure of the south facade. Here the deity head, maize element, and dais piece are identi- cal in form to those of the south facade side fig- ures. The feather headdress is likewise a virtual twin of that of the south fagade's eastern figure, with five tiers and a central smooth area in the uppermost two courses. The distribution of the fragments comprising this figure suggests strongly that it was placed axially above the western niche (Fig. 50). Based on the evidence of the central fig- ure on the south facade and on the length of the tenons (50 cm) of the base elements, we can be confident that this and the other upper-register fig- ures on the north facade were placed directly above the medial molding. The eastern figure of the north facade also 57</page><page sequence="62">Fig. 50 Plan map showing distribution of the fallen sculptural fragments of the north facade, western figure. Fig. 52 Plan map showing the distribution of the fallen sculptural fragments of the north facade, eastern figure. Fig. 51 Sandbox reconstruction of the north facade, eastern figure. matches the side figures of the south facade, as well as the western figure of the north facade (Fig. 51). Here both the distribution of the frag- ments (Fig. 52) and the burn marks on the pieces could be relied on during the reconstruction of this, the least well-represented of the north facade figures. The base was especially poorly preserved and, because of its lowermost position, suffered the greatest amount of burning. The body lacks the head, and the lower left arm is battered and broken. The headdress lacks the deity head, but the feathers are somewhat distinctive in that there is no crossing feather in the uppermost tier, as is present in all other cases. No dais was found. The central figure of the north facade, like that of the south facade, differs from its flanking ones. 58</page><page sequence="63">Fig. 53 Reconstruction drawing of the north facade, central figure. Fig. 54 Sandbox reconstruction of the north facade, central figure. Here, however, the differences extend beyond simply the central headdress motifs to include the body posture, clothing, base, and feather arrange- ments as well. This figure was clearly meant to stand out from the rest (Figs. 53, 54). The distri- bution of fragments (Fig. 55) demonstrates that this figure was originally positioned directly above the doorway leading into Room 1 . This figure is notably different in treatment and decoration from those of the lateral figures. Its face is more finely modeled, with more delicate earflares, a different treatment of the hair, and a central protruding element with side volutes (simi- lar in form to the maize element on the headgear of the lateral figures) in the place of the beaded diadem (Fig. 56). The body is also quite distinctive in both pos- ture and adornment. The right leg is shown tucked underneath the left thigh, but the lower left leg dangles down in front of the base, rather like that of the much earlier Olmec-style painting on the cave of Oxtotitlan (Fig. 57). His left ankle displays a finely worked sandal, though the toes of the foot are broken off. Around his neck hangs a necklace, also very distinctive, containing a long, monolithic pendant (probably like the jade ones found in many Late Classic Copan graves) held in place by a single row of round beads. Rather than having the arms doubled up with the hands flush against the chest, both arms are shown in the same position as those of the Pauah Tuns: upper arms down and held slightly out from the sides of the body, and lower arms held out perpendicularly, parallel to the ground. This positioning takes on more interest when we con- sider that the headdress carries the beaded wa- terlily motif (albeit inverted) that is shown as the pendant on the Pauah Tuns. Furthermore, the headdress also displays the tied waterlily motif identified by Thompson (1970) as a badge of the Bacab (or Pauah Tun, according to Coe [1973, 1978]). Thus the central figure seems to be identi- 59</page><page sequence="64">Fig. 55 Plan map showing distribution of the fallen sculptural fragments of the north facade, central figure. fied as being under the patronage of the Pauah Tun. Unfortunately, because both hands were broken off the forearms in ancient times, we may only postulate that the figure carried a conch shell inkpot in his left hand and a paintbrush in his right, as does the complete, full-round Pauah Tun/Monkey Man. Elaborate bracelets of the same form as the anklet adorn his wrists. The central headdress has a deity head quite unlike those of the side figures. The nose of the deity lines up nicely and dovetails with the central protruding element of the forehead of the human figure. A flared cap is shown perfectly atop the deity head, with a crossed-bands motif and the inverted beaded waterlily motif at the top and the tied waterlily at the bottom. The knot in the wa- terlily is located in the middle of a rectangular Fig. 56 Head and central headdress of the north facade, central figure. Fig. 57 Mural painting from Oxtotitlan, Mexico (after Joralemon 1974). 60</page><page sequence="65">cartouche, which begins on the forehead of the deity and continues on the cap piece, thus con- firming their proper positioning. The outflaring sides of the cap fit nicely in the hollows beneath the second uppermost tier of feathers, and this was considered the most probable placement for them in the reconstruction. The feathers them- selves are also quite distinctive, being wider and of greater length (1.66 m vs. 1.4- 1.5 m for those of the side figures), with a more elaborate cen- tral element (containing horizontal divisions or creases), and with seven plumes rather than five in the lowermost tier. The evidence suggests, though, that these feathers were composed of five tiers, like those of the rest of the figures. The base of the figure is rather unique, being made of smaller pieces. The tenons of the smaller pieces found on either side of the outset lower legs are much shorter than the rest of those com- prising the base. This fact supports the conclusion (p. 46) that the blocks were carved once they were in place on the building. The sculptor would have needed to leave a space on either side of the large "blanks" that were to become the base/lower leg pieces. Thereafter, these pieces could be easily filled by small stones with short tenons, which is exactly what we found. Another aspect of the base of the central figure is unique: the division between the upper and lower courses was made at the midpoint of the circular elements. Here we should note that the locus of division between the two courses in the bases is another piece of corroborating evidence for the reconstruction of three bases. For the base of the western figure, the division line was made below the circular elements; for the eastern fig- ure, it falls above these same elements; and for the base of the central figure, as noted, the division splits them in half (cf. Figs. 49, 51, 54). In trying to position this central sculpture prop- erly, several difficulties arose. Assuming a base with the same width as those of the side figures Fig. 58 Plan map showing the distribution of the fallen sculptural fragments of the east and west facades of Structure 9N-82 1st. 61</page><page sequence="66">(i.26 m), this figure would be placed asymmetri- cally with respect to the central axis of the base, for his left leg would be only 16 cm from the western edge of the base (as dictated by the fit of the circular elements, which invariably measure 22 cm across). Because the headdress of this cen- tral figure was wider than those of the side fig- ures, I considered that the base might also be wider. The fact that some pieces I had originally thought belonged to the easternmost set of circu- lar elements did not match up properly there also provided a convincing argument for the greater width of this central figure (1.42 m, for the circu- lar elements to align properly). For these reasons, then, I have chosen the reconstruction shown in Figures 53 and 54. Components of the East and West Facades While working with the feathers, we noted that there were two matching sets found in the 1981 excavations that were unlike any of those of the headdresses of the north or south facade figures. The height of the blocks was greater (21 cm vs. 13 and 16-18 cm), the layout of the feathers was distinctive, and they clearly did not fit with any of the other upper-register feather fragments. One set derived from the west side of the central Fig. 59 Sandbox reconstruction of the west facade fig- ure. superstructure, and the other derived from the east side (Fig. 58). Another piece was found on the south side of the building, directly south of the corridor between the central and western su- perstructures. Significantly, this latter fragment and the three found next to the west wall of the central superstructure had all obviously been burned while still in place (Figs. 59, 60), much like the niche and upper-register figures on the eastern part of the north facade. Furthermore, three feather pieces found among the IHAH sur- face collection of the early 1970s, which articulate with the other west side feathers, also exhibit burning. This fact led to the conclusion that all of these feather elements had originally been placed on the west facade, presumably in the upper regis- ter and situated over the doorway to Room 6. The form of these west facade feathers sug- gested a headdress, and two hands (CPN 3413/ 3418 and 3398) found in this same area derived from the figure that wore this headdress. Study of the IHAH collections produced the legs and belt for this figure, confirming that he, like the lateral figures on the north and south facades, sat cross- legged. For the east facade of the central superstructure we have one feather piece, found in the corridor Fig. 60 Reconstruction drawing of the west facade fig- ure. 62</page><page sequence="67">between the central and eastern superstructures (Fig. 58). The size, depth of relief, and design of this feather (Fig. 61) are identical to those of the west facade. There is also a human hand that is virtually identical in size and form to the hand from the west facade. In addition, a human bust (smaller and monolithic, unlike those of either the niches or the upper-register figures of the north facade) of the correct scale was found due north of the corridor between the central and eastern superstructures. The fact that these hands have tenons that extend back into the fill (rather than being attached to the bust, like those of the other facades) supports the identification of this bust as being from the east facade, because the bust was obviously carved without arms attached. The IHAH collection contained the legs and belt of this figure. The combined evidence strongly supports the conclusion that a seated, cross-legged human fig- ure wearing a feather headdress was inset above the doorways on the east and west facades of the central superstructure. The precise style of the headdresses is currently unknown. The lack of heads is not remarkable for four of the six fig- ures in the upper register of the north and south facades, and both of the lower-register figures lack heads. As with the central figure on the south facade, the presence of pieces from these Fig. 61 Sandbox reconstruction of the east facade fig- ure. figures in the IHAH collection is due to their having been closer to the surface, since collapse debris from the eastern and western superstruc- ture walls might have exposed some of these fragments on the surface. General Considerations of the Central Superstructure It is evident from the previous discussion that the horizontal positions of the sculptural compo- nents of the north and south facades can be clearly established from the distribution, fitting, and other structural evidence of the fallen fragments. Based on analogy with the north facade, one would presume that the purported eastern and western elements would have been centered above the doorways leading into Rooms 5 and 6. Evidence has also been presented that the bases of the upper-register figures were placed directly on top of the medial molding and were outset the same distance from the wall as the former. As such, the medial molding presents a sort of ground level upon which the bases and their re- spective upper-register occupants were seated. The height of the medial molding, and by ex- tension of the upper-register sculpture, is unfortu- nately a problem for which we have no direct physical evidence. None of the exterior super- structure walls was preserved to this height, nor were any of the interior walls preserved to the height of the vault spring, which would in all probability have corresponded to the height of the medial molding. Based on his extensive architectural experience at Tikal, Rudi Larios proposed a hypothetical re- construction of the cross section of the central superstructure of Structure 82 (personal communi- cation, 1982; Fig. 62). For this reconstruction, he assumed the doorway to be taller than it was wide by a proportion of roughly 5:4 (i.e., 1.25 m to 1 m). Directly above the doorway would have been a thick wooden lintel, giving way to the medial molding and vault spring at a height of 2.8 m above the level of the substructure terrace. The subsequent restoration of the niches on the north facade did nothing to refute Larios' idea, 63</page><page sequence="68">Fig. 62 Reconstruction of the cross section of Structures 9N-82 1st and 9N-82 2nd by Rudi Larios (drawing by Stanley Matta). for they are positioned more or less squarely in the middle of the proposed height of the lower register. For the upper register, the bevels of the innumerable vault stones found in the central room averaged 3 1 degrees from the vertical. Pro- jecting this from the proposed position of the vault spring and allowing for adequately thick cap- stones, the upper register would measure 3,4 m high from the top of the medial molding (40 cm high), giving a total height of 6.6 m for the cen- tral superstructure. The slight declination from the vertical of the upper facade is based on the fact that in the 1982 excavations we discovered and recognized a corner piece of the superior molding or cornice, which had an angle of 8 de- grees from the vertical. Neither the lower register nor the medial molding stones showed any decli- nation from the vertical, however, so the angle was restricted to the entablature and cornice. As noted, canal-shaped stone drains and/or capstones were found in back of the central superstructure south of the transverse walls, indicating that the thickly plastered roof was drained off the back side via two channels. The extensive trenching into the substructure and subsequent restoration work established clearly that Structure 9N-82 1st was originally a freestanding building. In this original building, the substructure measured 8.6 m (N-S) by 18.8 m (E-W) and was fronted on the north by a stairway some 13.6 m wide (Fig. 63). Using all of the available information, the reconstruction of the north facade of this building appears here as Fig- ure 64. Internal stratigraphic evidence showed 64</page><page sequence="69">Fig. 63 Plan of original, freestanding version of Structure 9N-82 1st. that the western substructure was added first (in two stages), and the eastern substructure was added subsequently. Prior to the construction of the freestanding Structure 9N-82 center 1st, another building had existed on the same site. Fragmentary sections of this edifice (Structure 9N-82 center 2nd) were found during the stabilization process, prior to the restoration of the (later) central room (1) of Structure 9N-82 center 1st (Fig. 62). Two pieces of a full-round, complete Pauah Tun sculpture were found in the fill of Structure 9N-82 center 1st, though separated by 9 m. This slightly smaller-than-life-size figure was decapitated and the head burned, with both pieces thrown into the fill during the construction of Structure 82 center 1st. This suggests that the sculpture was originally in use in the now destroyed earlier building and was ritually "killed" and buried when that building was abandoned. The continu- ity through time and space of Pauah Tun worship led us to hypothesize that this deity served as a lineage patron, or minimally the patron of the lineage or titular head of the group, through time (Webster and Abrams 1983: 295). The documenta- tion is sufficient, thanks to the relatively intact state of the facade sculpture corpus, for the case to be considered resolved. Interpretation and Comparative Study The presence of clear archaeological and epi- graphic evidence indicating that the building was occupied by two generations of scribes is of ex- treme interest. This structure has numerous fea- tures that reflect upon ancestor worship among the Classic Maya elite who resided here. Ancestor worship has been ably documented by many ethnographers of the twentieth-century Maya. The discovery of dynastic histories and royal portraits in the inscriptions and monumen- tal stone art of the Classic period by such pioneers as Heinrich Berlin and Tatiana Proskouriakoff showed that ancestor worship was a major focus of the art and architecture. These discoveries have now been augmented by the identification of par- entage statements in the inscriptions of the Classic period (Scheie, Mathews, and Lounsbury n.d.). The burial chambers and accompanying inscrip- tions found in the excavated pyramid temples of Tikal, Palenque, and other sites showed that kings were greatly revered after death.

Given the overwhelming evi- dence for ancestor worship among the ruling lin- eages of the Classic Maya realm and the equally strong evidence for ancestor worship among the peasant class twentieth-century Maya, one could predict that supernatural lineage patterns, ances- tor worship, and lineage perpetuation lore would all have been pervasive during the Late Classic period. It would appear that Structure 9N-82, with its significant archaeological remains and hi- eroglyphic and pictorial sculpture, gives us our best opportunity to date to study these questions. In the interest of furthering the discussion on this subject, I present my own interpretations (derived from the 1982 fieldwork and subsequently revised and refined) of the meaning and significance of Structure 9N-82 in comparative terms. The north facade of Structure 9N-82 faced onto Plaza A of Group 9N-8 and, as such, was the most ornate and symbolically explicit side of the building (Fig. 64). This facade was divided into two fields: the lower one (including the doorway and decorations on either side of it) relating to the supernatural world, the upper one (the entabla- ture) relating to the living, surface world. The serpents on either side of the doorway are charac- terized by their skeletal snouts and by the deco- rated ahau glyphic element shown at the end of their noseplugs. This glyph has been shown by Scheie, Mathews, and Lounsbury (n.d.) to have the meaning of "ancestor in the male line," and more specifically "father" in Classic period inscrip- tions. From the split serpents' jaws emerge an- thropomorphic deities, each of whom wears a beaded, trilobed waterlily motif as a necklace pen- dant. The eastern deity clearly depicts a patron of scribes and artists by virtue of the conch shell inkpot he carries in his left hand. By analogy with the figure found in association with the earlier version of Structure 82 (2nd), it represents, in all probability, a Pauah Tun (scribe). The upper reg- ister, in contrast, contains human figures in rich garb, whose clothing, faces, and headdresses indi- cate that they are dwellers of the surface world. Analogy with stelae, lintels, and ceramic vases of the Classic Maya period would indicate that these figures represent actual historical individuals. Given this basic framework, we can proceed to analyze the significance of the symbols and fig- ures depicted in these two fields. For the entablatures, the eastern and western figures of both the north and south facades are so similar as to be virtually identical to one another. The sharing of the inverted beaded waterlily mo- tif by the central figures on the north and south facades implies that these two facades are two sides of the same coin, as it were; that is, each side depicts the same three individuals. The similarity of the lateral figures on their re- spective fagades leaves one with the impression that these individuals were of equal stature to one another, and less important than the distinctive central figures. Their headdresses have what Linda Scheie (personal communication) calls the "personification head," with maize as the element in the forehead, which is to be understood as the being or object being given life. These side fig- ures are under the patronage of maize. Their iden- tity as historical individuals can only be specu- lated upon at this point. The maize reference may be a metaphor for a young man (i.e., a "youthful maize god"). It is interesting, though not conclu- sive, to note that some of the "maize god" busts from Temple 22 have similar, if not identical, hand positions as those from Structure 9N-82. The central figure on the north fagade is distin- guished from his two entablature companions by a number of features: a distinctive central head- dress complex, a different body position, a more finely detailed facial treatment, different clothing details, a wider base or throne, and possibly items held in the hands. Of particular interest are the central headdress elements. These elements serve as the diagnostic indicators of the supernatural aspects that their wearer assumes or emulates. For this figure, the indicators bear a remarkable resem- blance to the most prominent central elements in the headdresses of both sides of Copan Stela N (Fig. 65). Subsequent investigations of Copan facade sculpture have shown that this same headdress 67</page><page sequence="72">Fig. 65 The head and central headdress of Stela N, with dotted upper portion based on Maudslay 1889- 1902 (drawing by Barbara W. Fash). motif appears on figures from Temples 20, 22, 22 A, 32, and the fagade-ornamented structure at the site of Rio Amarillo. That small, curved ele- ment found with the central figure fragments of the south facade (Fig. 34) also appears in the head- dress of Stela N. Thus the long-nosed god (per- sonification) head, tied waterlily, and inverted beaded waterlily can be considered important ele- ments in the Copan royal line's own symbolism. How many other lateral, client, or rival lineages may be represented in the Copan Valley is an essential question for the future. The case of Rio Amarillo is of particular interest because the in- scription of Altar 1 at this site contains a nominal phrase ending with an emblem glyph that is not that of Copan. If emblem glyphs represent poli- ties, then I would venture that the facade figure from Structure 1 is probably a portrait of the local dynast. My interpretation of this symbol complex follows. David Stuart's recent and quite significant iden- tification of the dedication date of the Temple 22 bench as falling on an important anniversary in the reign of 18 Rabbit (Stuart n.d.) demonstrates that the use of Bacab or Pauah Tun benches be- gan no later than the first major temple of that king. It continues into the reign of the fifteenth ruler (Smoke-Squirrel, depicted on his headdress on Stela N and in the inner chamber of Temple 26), but almost certainly reaches its climax in the reign of the sixteenth ruler, Rising Sun. Examples of Pauah Tun/Bacab iconography dating to the reign of Rising Sun include those of Temple 21 (first discovered by the author in 1984), Temple 11 (the famous "Old Man" head, and his little- remarked-upon twin brother at the base of the steps), 9M-18 Structure A (Willey, Leventhal, and Fash 1978), CPN 999, from Group 10K-4, and the Structure 9N-82 facade and bench. We have already noted the close association be- tween the beaded waterlily motif and the Struc- ture 9N-82 1st (facade) and 2nd (full-round fig- ure) Pauah Tuns. The same association is found on Princeton Vase 16 (Coe 1978). In his consider- ation of the patrons of Maya scribes and artists, Coe illustrates Figure 2 of this vessel, without including a beaded element and pendants as part of that figure (Coe 1977: fig. 11). This element would thus pertain to the deity pictured immedi- ately in back of that figure, labeled Figure 1 in Coe's book (1978), and here represented as Figure 66. Fig. 66 Figure from Peten polychrome vase (after Coe 1978: rollout fig. 1). 68</page><page sequence="73">Fig. 67 Ceramic vessel from Copan Tomb 7-42 (draw- ing by Jose Humberto Espinoza). This individual also clearly represents a god of writing, by virtue of his "extra" ear with T7 infix, "computer printout" with bar and dot numerals, and conch shell inkpot in the right hand (for a Copan equivalent, see Fig. 67). The beaded wa- terlily here is shown frontally, but half of it is obscured behind the back of Figure 2, just as is the left hand. Even if we were to consider the motif here as associated with Figure 2 (the "Mon- key Man" God of Writing: Coe 1977; 1978: 106), this would only serve to strengthen the associa- tion between this motif and the Pauah Tun of Structure 9N-82 center 2nd, which has decidedly simian facial features (Fig. 45). Indeed, one is led to wonder whether the oft-repeated association of one of the four Bacabs/Pauah Tuns with the conch shell at Copan, Chichen Itza (Morris, Chariot, and Morris 193 1, 2), and at other sites and on painted ceramics of the Classic period may be derived partly from the association of this par- ticular deity with a conch shell inkpot, in his guise as a patron of Maya scribes and artists. The interrelatedness of the Pauah Tun concept or deity with that of the Bacabs is, as Baudez (Chapter 3) points out, well worth debating. The Maya name for the full-round sculpture in Struc- ture 9N-82 center 2nd, however, is not. It is un- ambiguously labeled as a Pauah Tun by the net bag (pauah) covering the hair and the tun sign on each upper arm. The Underworld associations demonstrated for the Pauah Tun by Michael Coe in the case of the niches of the Structure 9N-82 center 1st facade are clearly marked by the ser- pents from whose jaws the Pauah Tuns emerge. The serpent heads have fleshless, bony snouts, and the "decorated ahau" (father) glyphic element sprouts at the end of the noseplug elements that emerge from their nostrils. From the above, it may be suggested that the Pauah Tun, tied waterlily, and beaded waterlily motifs in the headdress of the central figure of the north facade of Structure 9N-82 are used to associ- ate that individual with the Pauah Tun, supernatu- ral patron of scribes and artists. This association is apparently verified by the text of the hiero- glyphic bench of the central room of 82 center 1st, which according to Berthold Riese (Chapter 4) refers to the protagonist of the inscription (who also dedicates the temple) as "Ahau Kin." Riese further infers this to mean that the protago- nist was an astronomer and calendar specialist. Such an individual must of course have been an accomplished scribe in order to practice such an esoteric trade. The distinguishing features and distinctive placement of the central figure of the entablature signify that this figure represents a portrait of the bench protagonist. That this protagonist was not the ruler of Copan is itself quite clear in the in- scription, which refers to Rising Sun in a secon- dary clause, following the initial clause referring to the date of commemoration of the temple, the act of commemoration itself, and the protagonist of that action, whose name is clearly different from that of any of the Copan dynasts. Elsewhere I have developed a multivariant model to explain the sudden and explosive prolif- eration of elite stone art during the reign of Ris- ing Sun (Fash 1983b: 258-260). The model is rooted in the demographic and environmental conditions existent during the reign of this last, seemingly most creative and beneficent Copan ruler. It was argued that the requirements of the Maya socioreligious and political system had dev- astating effects in Copan when it developed within an ecologically maladaptive settlement sys- tem. Therein the agriculturally richest, most cen- tralized land in the Copan Valley was given over 69</page><page sequence="74">to a series of urban wards, forcing subsistence agriculture and cash-cropping upslope. This prac- tice, in turn, entailed deforestation, shorter fallow cycles, soil exhaustion and erosion, and eventu- ally long-term precipitation loss. These condi- tions were exacerbated by factional politics among the oldest andVor most powerful lineages not only of Copan but apparently of Quirigua as well. It is my contention that the whole political system would have collapsed quite abruptly with- out continuing tribute from the elite lineages who supported it. This model sees Rising Sun and his court as seeking to ensure continued tribute by bestowing the ultimate royal prerogative upon the most im- portant lineage heads: hieroglyphic texts and re- lief sculptures with complex iconography. This represents a significant "sharing of information" of the highest, most sacred order, and as such is all the more interesting in theoretical terms. The consistent, overarching cosmological theme of the Rising Sun era monuments, depict- ing the Bacabs/Pauah Tuns and other supernatu- ral patrons as supporters - literally, the pillars - of the world order, makes perfect sense in this context. The fact that individuals other than the ruler Rising Sun are found in at least two more texts (Altar W' and the frieze of Structure 9N- 69) from this same residential compound indi- cates that local individuals also had the preroga- tive to dedicate inscribed and iconographically complex monuments in their own honor, within the context of their own sacred space. Given the striking evidence for continuity of Pauah Tun/ Scribe worship, the identification of the lineage head with said deity, and the broken fragments of hieroglyphic texts from previous (quite proba- bly local) monuments in the central stairway steps of Structure 9N-82 (Webster, Fash, and Abrams 1986), it should not greatly surprise us that the local lineage head would place himself - adorned with the symbols that simultaneously signify his supernatural patron, royal patron, and lineal ancestors - in the most prominent, public position on the structure. Riese (Chapter 4) believes that this individual is labeled as the "second in the sequence" of Ahau Kins in the inscribed bench text and that the ini- tial verb of the inscription makes a reference to Yax (green) Bacab (Pauah Tun) as well as the locative statement "in the house or temple. " This indicates that both 9N-82 center 1st and its prede- cessor, 9N-82 2nd, were houses (or "temples") of Pauah Tuns: both the supernatural deity and his flesh-and-blood followers, a supposition bol- stered by the presence of the full-round Pauah Tun/Monkey Man in association with the earlier building. In personal communications, Peter Mathews has pointed out that this would provide a possible explanation for the westernmost sup- port of the bench, which structurally should show a Pauah Tun/Bacab figure, but instead shows a human figure carrying the "decorated ahau ' (ancestor or father) glyph on a rope connect- ing him with the surface of the bench. This figure may represent the "first in the sequence" - the apotheosized ancestor of the protagonist of Struc- ture 9N-82 central 1st. In this context one is re- minded of Coe's thoughts on the nature of Maya residential compounds cum holy places: Who, then, might have been worshipped in a Maya temple? A god or the dead ruler for whom it was raised? Here we have an example of the false use of categories derived from our own culture, for in prehispanic Mexico and Central America these might have been one and the same. The rulers were descended from the gods, and a king probably be- came identified with his lineage god after death. By paying homage to the man, one was also paying homage to the god. Finely-made masonry tombs lav- ishly equipped with grave goods have often been found underneath the floors of the palaces as well. In other words, an ancient Maya center might have been as much a necropolis for rulers as a seat for the Maya administration. (Coe 1973: 7) This brings up a final point. Buried below and in front of the northeast corner of Structure 9N- 82 2nd was the grave of an adult male. Labeled Burial VIII-6, this individual had been interred in a tightly flexed position and provided with three Late Classic polychrome pots and a single, 16-cm long, greenstone pectoral (Fig. 68). Judging from the ceramics, flexed position (generally confined to the Late Classic period at Copan), and strati- graphic context and position of this burial, it probably dates to the time of use of Structure 9N- 70</page><page sequence="75">Fig. 68 Burial VIII-6. Note greenstone bar pectoral on chest of flexed skeleton. 82 2nd and the early, full-round Pauah Tun/ Scribe statue. The most compelling thing about the burial is the greenstone pectoral, which is vir- tually identical in size to the one depicted on the chest of the central figure of the north facade of Structure 9N-82 center 1st (Figs. 53, 54). The burial and the central facade figure provide fur- ther evidence for ancestor worship and lineage perpetuation lore, with the new lineage head proudly displaying the insignia of the same super- natural patron worn by (and buried with) his scribal predecessor and ancestor. Considering the demonstrated importance of ancestor worship among the Maya and other cultures sharing a simi- lar level of sociopolitical complexity, these data from Structure 9N-82 provide solid comparative evidence for the practice among the nonroyal elites of the Classic period. Significance of the Fagade of Copan Structure 9N-82 The excavation, documentation, and analysis of Structure 9N-82 and its associated remains have provided a solid base from which to explore some of the more sociocultural kinds of questions posed by anthropologists. Aspects of religion and social organization are often among the more diffi- cult problems for which archaeologists must gain direct, irrefutable evidence. Lacking living infor- mants, we are very much dependent on the preser- vation, explicitness, and methodologically sound interpretation of the relics of belief systems. In order to be credible to our anthropologist col- leagues, these analyses should be congruent or otherwise complementary to comparative materi- als, preferably documented sources. The significance of the case of Structure 9N-82 is that it is both congruent and complementary to the written records of its day and to documented sources of the colonial and modern periods con- cerning the fundamental nature of Maya super- natural (and living) patrons, ancestor worship, and lineage perpetuation lore. More compelling yet is the association between those cited in the inscriptions and portrayed in the symbolism of the building and the only contemporaneously bur- ied individual found in the thorough excavation, reconsolidation, and restoration of this multifac- eted structure. 7i</page><page sequence="76">Comparative study has revealed some associa- tions between the beaded waterlily motif, the Pauah Tun/Bacab, and other gods of writing in other works of Maya art, an association most clearly shown and conflated in the full-round Pauah Tun/Monkey Man sculpture of Structure 9N-82 center 2nd. The presence of Pauah Tun/ Bacab tied and beaded waterlily motifs in the headdress of the central figure on the north facade cements the association between the protagonist of the hieroglyphic bench in Room 1 (Ahau Kin) and the Pauah Tun in his guise as patron of Maya scribes, artists, and, apparently in this case, calendric specialists. It has been proposed here that this centralized, most public figure in the Plaza A compound of Group 9N-8 represents the protagonist of the initial, dated, locative clause of the hieroglyphic inscription. Structure 9N-82 was constructed at a nonroyal locus and should be appreciated as a monument to the local lineage, both its contemporary head and his lineal ancestors. This conclusion is based on the good evidence for Pauah Tun/Scribe wor- ship in successive generations (the full-round statue of 9N-82 2nd, and the facade and bench motifs on 9N-82 center 1st), the fragments of ear- lier, probably local hieroglyphic monuments in- corporated into the 9N-82 1st stairway, the proba- ble commemoration of Altar W' at this site (which does not cite the reigning dynast), and the wearing of a single pectoral by the central figure on the facade in emulation of the one worn by and interred with the lineage head buried in asso- ciation with Structure 9N-82 2nd. One should also note that the practice of incorporating previ- ous monuments in the steps of later buildings was undertaken by the royal line as well. Both 18 Rab- bit (in the frontal stairway of Structure 10L-2) and Smoke-Squirrel (in a reused block in the Hi- eroglyphic Stairway of Structure 10L-26) incorpo- rated broken glyphic monuments that cited their predecessors into the steps of their important buildings, in honor of their ancestors. In sum, localized lineage ancestor worship was tied into worship of that lineage's supernatural patron, just as was the case for the royal line. Replication of structures and concepts in Maya social organization and cosmogony is a well- accepted fact among ethnographers and archaeolo- gists; the present case material provides us with a unique opportunity to examine the phenomenon on a local level and scale. The foregoing analysis has sought to draw out the interrelatedness of the supernatural world of deities and ancestors and the living world of their supplicators and descendants. From ethnohistoric and hieroglyphic data we know that lineage ties were the ultimate determinants of Classic Maya social and political organization, and Coe (1973) has argued that only the elite lineages had any chance of escaping the Underworld after death. He has further surmised that scribes and calendric specialists were held in great esteem among the Classic Maya, just as they were among the later Mexica (Coe 1977) and that these occupations were restricted to elite noble lines. The facade and bench of Structure 9N-82 center 1st and the burial and statue associated with Structure 9N-82 center 2nd provide solid archaeological evidence for these arguments. 72</page><page sequence="77">CHAPTER 3 The House of the Bacabs: An Iconographic Analysis Claude F. Baudez Introduction Structure 9N-82 center, the House of the Bacabs, is the first major building outside of the Main Group at Copan that has been scientifically exca- vated. A large part of the sculpture that graced the outer walls has been recovered, and the bench in the central room, carved with both text and images, is very well preserved. The analysis of the rich and complex imagery of this building, combined with the epigraphic study by Riese (Chapter 4), has two main purposes: (a) to obtain additional information on Maya representations, be they concerned with mythology, rituals, or sociopolitical structure, and (b) to offer hypothe- ses concerning the nature and function of the building. In this chapter I discuss first the decora- tive sculpture ornamenting the outer facades of the building and then the iconography on the hi- eroglyphic bench inside the central room. The Facade Decoration The Lower Register The relief decoration of the lower register is restricted to the north wall of the building and is situated on either side of the main entrance (Figs. 44, 64). Here there are two anthropomorphic busts, each enclosed within the jaws of a skeletal serpent head. The best preserved of these statues, the one to the east of the doorway, holds a paint container in his left hand and has a trilobal pecto- ral adorning his chest (Fig. 41). Because both ob- jects are elements of the scribe statue, an old man seated tailor-fashion (Figs. 45-47) associated with an earlier version of Structure 82, I assume that the east bust also had a brush in his right hand and a wrinkled face. The western bust is armless but sports the same pectoral as the statue to the east. Both statues were probably alike;1 symme- try, as a rule, is very strictly observed at Copan when two motifs are equally distant and placed on the same plane as another motif or an opening (for instance, the two jaguars on Structure 24 or the two rattle bearers on Structure 12). Assuming that the two busts were similar to each other and both to their original model, they represent old men each wearing a trilobal pectoral and holding a conch shell paint container and brush, the imple- ments of scribes. These elders may be called Bacabs, as will be seen in the following pages. Their pectorals are in the form of a stylized wa- terlily blossom, identifiable by the general trilobal form including a wide central part adorned with a half circle at the top. As a pectoral this motif can be seen on several sculptures in the East Court (Proskouriakoff 1950: fig. 22a', b') and at Although I do not know how to orient it, I do not believe that the round element (Fig. 48) found among the other niche fragments has anything to do with the statue. It may come from another part of the building or even from another struc- ture; we know that in the Las Sepulturas zone some distur- bance and looting of sculpture took place long before modern times (Fash, Chapter 2). I would suggest that the two torch- like elements with ik signs are emanations from the nostrils of a serpent, like the ones on Copan Altar U. 73</page><page sequence="78">Quirigua, where it is worn by the central figure on the rear of Stela I (Morley 1935: 118). This motif is part of the ruler's headdress on Copan Stela N and of the toad on Altar D' (Maudslay 1889-1902, 1: pl. 114). The waterlily, a variant of which became the imix glyph, is a symbol of the Earth. It is constantly associated with earthly crea- tures such as Bacabs, toads, crocodiles, and so forth; it is also the plant that grows in the waters of the Underworld (Coggins 1983: 61) and, by extension, is a symbol of fertility. The serpent head enclosing each Bacab is de- picted as two upper jaws connected by the same mandible; it is the split representation of a single head, presented in this way to show the figure completely enclosed within the serpent's mouth (Figs. 41, 42). The split head is common at Copan, where it occurs in a number of situations: it frames low-relief scenes (e.g., on top of the altar at the base of the Hieroglyphic Stairway), doors (e.g., on Structure 11), or on bench inscrip- tions (CPN 999; Fig. 69). Nevertheless, it is with the split head in the west room of Structure 16 that the heads on the 9N-82 facade find their clos- est analogue. This is a relief that enclosed a cross- legged human statue (Maudslay 1889-1902, 1: pl. 10a; Hohmann and Vogrin 1982: pl. 86). Under the serpent's mandible is a T-shaped mo- tif with a row of beads and an upper bar ending in two hooks, perhaps a decorated form of the T23 glyph. This sign is read na (house), so its associa- tion with the Bacab/scribe figure could indicate that the building was his house. This interpreta- tion is analogous to Thompson's (1973) reading of the facades at the Uxmal Nunnery Quadrangle where a hut combined with a reptilian mask would reproduce the name Itzam Na; this suggestion is strengthened by Riese's reading (see Chapter 4) of glyph block C on the hieroglyphic bench inscrip- tion as "in the house of the green Bacab. " As another possibility one may identify this sign as the T that often adorns the forehead of the Earth Monster and is sometimes used alone as a pedestal (Copan Str. 18, southwest jamb) or a seat (Tonina Mon. 135). The Upper Register The upper sculptural register includes figures on both the north and south facades of the build- ing: these are the only ones sufficiently well pre- served to be discussed. On the north facade are two identical male statues flanking a central figure whose attitude and costume differ from those of his neighbors (Fig. 64). The flanking figures are seated tailor-fashion, but the central one has one leg tucked under him and the other dangling down. His arms are extended forward, and the hands may have held objects. In contrast, his com- panions hold their hands at chest level. Each wears a multiple-row collar, while the central fig- ure displays instead a long, tubular bead or pecto- ral. This figure wears a reptilian helmet crowned by superimposed motifs that are waterlily forms; the pad, an edge-indented rectangle, is secured by Fig. 69 Bench from the 10K-4 group, Copan (CPN 999). 74</page><page sequence="79">a knotted stem and flower, themselves topped by the stylized blossom that we have already seen on the chests of the Bacab/scribes (Figs. 53, 54). The flanking figures have the same helmet, but each is topped instead by a maize cob surrounded by leaves. On the south facade the two side statues are similar to the ones on the north, to judge by the easternmost, best-preserved figure (Figs. 27, 28). Of the central personage there remain only the bust and the top of the headdress; the former is similar to those of the flanking statues, while the waterlily found in the excavation is associated, on the north facade, with the central figure (Figs. 27, 53). In summary, the upper-register figures from the northern and southern sides may not be ex- actly alike. Of the eight figures from the upper register, only the one placed above the main door- way on the north side seems to have been more important than the others. These statues do not depict supernaturals, for their faces are wholly human and not grotesque; moreover, they are dressed as rulers and dignitar- ies. They are not ancestors because they lack any symbol indicating that they belong to the Under- world (such as a shell replacing the ear). Further- more, it would be unusual to show ancestors of unequal rank without naming the main lord. We must then assume that we are dealing with some real, living dignitary and members of his entour- age. The former may be the occupant of the house, that is, the individual who lived or worked in this building. In this case, he was al- lowed to take the same posture and don the same costume as the king. We do not know whether this was possible because all the humans por- trayed at Copan, whether alive or dead, seem to be rulers. An alternative hypothesis is that the sculptures of the upper register represent the king and his retinue. In fact, the major figure possesses the same headdress as Rising Sun on Copan Stela N. Since the inscription on the bench includes the name and titles of this king, I can see no reason why his portrait should not appear on the facade of the building. Accepting this interpretation does not imply that the king lived in, or carried out any activity in, this house. The only implication is that the king had his portrait carved on every important building, just as his names could be read on every important inscription. Whether he was the house's occupant or the ruler, the person portrayed above the door and his retinue convey the same message through their headdresses. Their reptilian (and probably crocodilian) helmets are crowned either with wa- terlilies or maize. As we will see later, this iconog- raphy is closely related to the iconography of the Bacabs. The Inner Decoration: The Hieroglyphic Bench The bench and the north facade have the same structure. Both are three-level compositions with Bacabs on the lower register and humans on the upper. The middle level is represented by the bicephalic monster on the front edge of the bench and, on the facade, by the medial molding (Fig. 13). The Middle Register The body of a bicephalic monster, indicated by a row of scales, is carved on the front edge of the bench. It supports an inscription of 16 full-figure blocks. The forelimb, to the viewer's left, has serpent markings and the trifoil sign often found at the elbow or knee of such monsters. The rear limb has none of these markings but is adorned by a bead anklet above the deer hoof that many monsters possess. The front head, on the left, is alive; it has the ek sign (star, or Venus) in the eye and tubes in the nose. Its jaws open on the wrin- kled face of a Bacab who wears a round ear orna- ment with three circlets and a knotted vegetal ele- ment (waterlily) on the forehead. The rear head faces inward, instead of outward as expected. This inverted position is characteris- tic of the rear heads of many monsters, which may also be shown upside down. Inversion (as a mirror image of the earthly world) stresses the fact that the skeletal head belongs to the Under- world. On the forehead, instead of the usual kin in a cartouche, is represented the back of a hand 75</page><page sequence="80">with extended joint fingers. Although it is verti- cally presented, it looks more like a 1713 a than a T710, whose spread fingers are generally associ- ated with circlets for blood drops. Assuming that this hand is meant for T7i3a, it is not a substitute for kin but rather a sign for completion or death (for the dead sun or the dead head of the mon- ster). The tripartite emblem is on the top; its cen- tral element, probably a spine used in bloodlet- ting, is bent back for lack of space, showing that we are dealing with a flexible object. Flanking it are the shell on one side and the percentage sign on the other (T509); the latter substitutes for the crossed-bands (T58: 522) sign as, for example, on the inner doorway of Structure 22 at Copan or on the sarcophagus lid at Palenque. Outside Copan I know of only one bench with a bicephalic mon- ster supporting an inscription; this is the subterra- nean throne in the Palace at Palenque, dated ca. 9. 1 1. 0.0.0 (Fig. 70; Robertson 1974: 86, fig. 19). Bicephalic monsters are cosmic creatures used in Maya iconography to represent either the heav- ens or the earth or even, as Thompson (1970: 214) has suggested, the "sides" of the universe. When the monster has an arch form and frames a door- way or a niche (Copan Str. 22; Piedras Negras Stelae 6, 11, 14, 25), it is meant to be the sky. When the monster is horizontally stretched out one has to rely on the context to decide which part of the universe is represented, unless cauac markings indicate the Earth. In this instance, de- spite the absence of cauac markings, I think the bench shows the Earth for two reasons: (a) To present real people sitting on the sky does not make sense; conversely, it is a Maya pictorial con- vention to show rulers and dignitaries seated on an image or symbol of the Earth, (b) One of the Copan benches (Fig. 69) is made up of the split head of the cauac monster enclosing an inscrip- tion, and the bench of Structure 18 carries cauac signs on its front edge (Baudez 1983: fig. Mxi8). The Upper Register A human figure, facing inward, is seated on each of the monster's heads. To the east is the complete figure of a man wearing a feathered cape, a skirt, and a belt; he stretches his left hand forward, while the right holds a three-pointed ec- centric before his chest. His headdress includes a squint-eyed mask of a bird(?) with a serpent wing to the side; above it is a band adorned with the mat motif and beads to form the zac glyph, mean- ing something like "pure power." The man wears an earplug with tube, a bead in front of the nose, bracelets of tubular beads, and a small pectoral inscribed with the po sign (Lounsbury 1973). Fig. 70 Throne from the Palace at Palenque. 76</page><page sequence="81">Along his back and probably forming a title or emblem we find successively a heron, a bundle or the end of the ceremonial bar, and a long-nosed mask. Like the major figure on the fagade, this personage is not a supernatural, nor is he an ances- tor; he may be the occupant of the house, al- though I prefer to see him as the ruler, if only because the pectoral he wears designates him as ah po (He of the mat). The upper two-thirds of the figure seated on the rear (right) head are missing, probably be- cause of looting. The posture is different from the figure on the front head, and both hands are empty; clothing is reduced to loincloth, and wrist- lets are of a type worn only by supernaturals or ancestors at Copan as well as Palenque (Scheie 1976: 14). This incomplete figure, seated on the skeletal head, is probably an ancestor; his counter- part is seated on the live head, to the east where the sun rises and near the emerging Bacab. A comparable situation is expressed on Copan Stela B, where the front head of the Earth Monster gives way to the emerging ruler, and an ancestor figure is seated at the top of the rear head (Baudez 1985b: fig. 6). The two humans are elements of opposition comparable to the one created by the two heads of the monster. The Lower Register Three pairs of anthropomorphic figures are carved in the supports of the bench. The outer- most figures forming the first pair are taller than the others and slightly outset relative to the verti- cal plane of the bench. The four inner figures are inset under the bench; the spaces between them form three wide niches (Figs. 13, 14). The inward-looking figures of the innermost pair are presenting the personified form of the lancet for autosacrifice: a serpent head, crowned by three knotted bands and long feathers, whose tongue is the instrument's blade or point (Jora- lemon 1974; Baudez 1985a). Both figures are dressed in simple loincloths but wear elaborate jade jewelry in the form of earplugs, collars, pec- torals (partly hidden), and wristlets. The figure to the right has a fish helmet; his companion sports a bird helmet facing outward, and an axe-and- smoke design sprouts out of his forehead. At Copan at least, this motif is exclusive to super- naturals and dead humans, whether they are rul- ers (e.g., Rising Sun on Stela 11) or slain enemies (Hieroglyphic Stairway). These two figures are most likely ancestors - they appear perfectly human - located in the Underworld. On the monuments the ancestors' main function is pre- cisely to display the implements or the results of autosacrifice. We have already seen an allusion to this rite in the form of the eccentric held by the personage on top of the live head of the monster. Continuing away from the center, the second pair of figures consists of two old men, facing outward, each of whom supports the bicephalic monster with one hand while bracing himself against the ground with the other. Each wears a long, flexible headdress (with no crosshatching) secured by a band knotted above the forehead; a pectoral made of a section of a shell adorns the chest of each, and their ears are covered by round ornaments with three circlets of the type com- monly worn by Bacabs and toads. The eastern figure of the outermost pair is drawn in the same position but faces inward; it represents an old man adorned with the same jew- els described above. In lieu of a true headdress or a cap, he has, amidst tufts of sparse hair, a knot- ted waterlily blossom nibbled by a fish; cauac markings are scattered on his body, and in front of the nose one can see tii8, a stylized serpent's upper jaw that seems, again, to be exclusive to supernaturals and ancestors. Along with the other two lower-register figures just discussed, they cer- tainly remind one of the Bacabs, who, according to traditions collected by Landa (1959), supported the sky at the four corners of the universe. Be- cause these creatures must be four in number and because of considerations of symmetry, one sus- pects that the last (western) figure of the outer- most pair must also be a Bacab, even if his aspect, attitude, and attributes are different from the oth- ers. Besides its aesthetic appeal, the nonlinear pat- tern formed by the two recessed and two project- ing outer supports emphasizes, through its two axes, the four figures' positions at the four cor- ners of the world. Let us leave aside for a while 77</page><page sequence="82">the case of the atypical outermost Bacab and con- sider the other three supporting figures. Landa's Bacabs were said to uphold the Heav- ens, while our atlantean figures support a bicephalic monster that, according to my previ- ous assertion, designates the Earth. Do Bacabs also support the iarth? As we will see later, Bacabs are earth creatures, and they may stand as well above or below the surface of the Earth, a concept unimportant to the Maya. As the cosmic monster may be sometimes Sky, sometimes Earth, the creatures who support it as Sky may well uphold it as the Earth. Furthermore, we have already mentioned two examples of benches that clearly represent the Earth. Thus we can con- ceive of the three figures of old men who support the bench, as well as the beings on the fagade with their writing implements, as Bacabs. The reader may prefer to call them Pauah Tuns, four gods of rain and wind assigned to specific colors and directions. Whatever designation we choose to use, or was used by the ancient Copanecos, it must be applied to all of the scribe figures on the outside of the building and to the atlantean fig- ures associated with the bench. I follow Tozzer ( 1 94 1 : 136, note 632) when he states, "It is impos- sible to place the Bacabs, the Chacs, the Pauahs, and the Uayeyabs, each in a distinct and special category." To this list I would add the anthropo- morphic numeral five, God N, and the Mams. In Copan sculpture Bacabs occur in two kinds of situations, both of which are illustrated by our bench: (a) either they are supporting an image of the celestial vault (e.g., Structure 22) or of the Earth (e.g., this bench and the one found in group 9M-18), or (b) a Bacab may emerge from the jaws of the front live head of the monster (e.g., this bench, "altar" GI, Altar M). Its skeletal rear head rarely disgorges any being; exceptions to this are the Jaguar/Nocturnal Sun ("altar" GI) and "God K" (Altar W'). The toad is a functional analogue of the Bacab. On the top of Altar D' it is likewise opposed to theJaguar/Sun, and in addition it exhib- its Bacab-like features such as a wrinkled face, ear ornaments with three circlets, and a waterlily sym- bol. The anthropomorphic maize that emerges from the live monster's head on the same Altar D' may also be associated with the Bacab. The ruler, in his accession image as the sun rising out of the jaws of the Earth Monster, is another possibility. Although at Copan he emerges from a monster with live heads at each end (e.g., on Stelae B and C), at Quirigua he rises from the live head of the monster whose rear head is skeletal (Zoomorphs O and P). Besides this, the ruler sometimes wears Bacab symbols such as waterlily forms, which are related to the Earth; he may even adopt their role as atlantean figures, as on the El Grillo (CPN 999) bench whose two supports represent the king Ris- ing Sun in glyphic form (Fig. 69). We have, thus, the following pairs of opposi- tions: front (head) rear (head) live (head) dead (head) Bacab Jaguar/Nocturnal Sun toad maize God K with skeletal ruler mandible This bipolarity, which permeates Maya cosmol- ogy, is also illustrated by the bench supports from Group 9M-18 (Fig. 71; Willey et al. 1978). The front edge of the 9M-18 bench is carved only with an inscription and is supported by four pairs of small, rounded pillars. Each pair consists of two atlantean figures, a death image, and a Bacab emerging from a seashell. On the 9N-82 bench, the same configuration of opposites (Bacab/death) is expressed in the text at glyph block G. The eight masks supporting the bench of Structure 10L-18 are those of the Cauac Earth Monster alter- nating with those of the Jaguar/Sun (Baudez 1983: 485, fig. Mxi8). In the basic opposition, the Bacab is on the Earth side along with the toad, the maize, and the ruler. Opposed to Death and theJaguar/Sun, he is the positive member of the contrasting pair and represents life, creation, and fertility. The earthly nature of the Bacab is often emphasized by cauac signs (as on the easternmost figure of our bench) or heads (as on the inner door of Structure 22). Copan is one of the very few Classic Maya 78</page><page sequence="83">centers in the central and southern Lowlands to exhibit Bacabs carved in stone. On the edge of Tikal Altar 4, four old men, enclosed by a quadrifoil, present an offering; they alternate with profiles of the Earth Monster (Jones and Satterth- waite 1983: fig. 58b). Each wears a shell pectoral dangling from a bead collar; two have a turtle carapace on their backs, and each has in the same position a rounded waterlily pad(?) with the kan sign in the middle (compare with the figure in Dresden 37a). Altar 4 is stylistically dated from the end of the Early Classic or the very beginning of the Late Classic period. The Bacabs are unknown in Copan sculpture before the reign of Rising Sun. Their almost com- plete absence from the sculpture of the central Lowlands during the Classic period does not mean that the Bacab concept was unknown. God N, who cannot be distinguished from the old Bacabs (see, e.g., Coe 1978, vase 10), is ubiqui- tous on Late Classic polychrome vessels. Besides Copan and Tikal, the Bacab theme is treated on Puuc buildings at Uxmal (on the west building of the Nunnery Quadrangle), Chichen Itza (La Iglesia, called by Teobert Maler [1944] - because of the Bacabs - El Templo del Caracol y de la Tortuga), Xculoc (Stephens 1843, 2: pls. xv-xvn; Pollock 1980: fig. 627), and Nohoch Mul (Maler 1944). The examples from the latter two sites have never been published in detail, but are clearly atlantean figures. The Bacabs found at Uxmal and Puuc Chichen Itza are old men shown variously as emerging from a shell, carrying a turtle carapace, or placed in front of a spider web. These three forms even- tually become very popular in Maya-Toltec Chichen. There they were carved as the main fig- ures on columns, or as secondary figures beneath a warrior or above him holding up the ceiling. They can also be found on the tail pieces of the serpent columns holding up the roofs. Because of its distribution in time and space the Bacab concept may have come to Copan from the northern Lowlands, together with a host of other traits that were imported during the reign of Ris- ing Sun. Let us return now to the westernmost (right) support, which is carved with a figure who does not hold up the bench. Like his eastern counter- part, he sports the waterlily knotted on the fore- head and nibbled by a fish, along with the tii8 sign in front of the nose; a waterlily pad on his knee underlines his terrestrial nature. He is a young man holding a rope ended by a "decorated ahau" head. His attitude is not that of a man de- scending or hanging from the sky using a rope.

Fig. 73 Bench support, Copan (CPN 849). Maya iconography in general, and especially at Copan, the rope is a symbol of captivity and sacrifice - themes usually alien to the Bacabs. A rope connecting several figures could also repre- sent an umbilical cord - that is, filiation. But our figure is not related to any other and presents the rope rather than being tied to it and thus con- nected. We might be dealing here with a linguis- tic message. Rope is k'aan in Yucatec (Barrera Vasquez et al. 1980) and might stand for k'an, maize. This kind of substitution would not be unique in Maya iconography and epigraphy. Houston (1984: 790-805) has presented evidence for substitutions of signs for sky, snake, and the number four, all of which are homophonous or almost homophonous in most Maya languages. Thus the substitution of k'aan for k'an is perfectly possible. Palenque offers a good example of young men acting as Bacabs. The carved legs of the Del Rio throne, which was standing below the Oval Tab- let in the Palace, display a youthful figure who possibly represents a Bacab (Scheie 1978: figs. 11, 12). The best-preserved leg, known as the Ma- drid Stela, shows a young individual seated on the Earth Monster, which has imix in its eye (Fig. 72). The man holds up a waterlily pad with flower attached as well as the bench, which is carved with an inscription. The figure wears the same headdress as the one worn by the Bacabs on Copan Structure 22, a knotted band with criss- crossed areas around the forehead. Very similar to the Del Rio legs is an undocumented sculpture from Copan (CPN 849) which was certainly a support for a bench (Fig. 73). This personage is shown seated on the Earth Crocodile with a wa- terlily pad close by. His right hand is up, but, due to erosion, its exact position is unknown. The figure's face is also eroded, and no features are recognizable with the exception of a beard. At knee level is the Copan emblem and the Ba-ca-b(a) compound. I contend that the westernmost support of the bench represents a Bacab, although of a variety distinct from the usual old men. Both varieties share the symbolism of earthly creatures, closely associated with vegetal growth and fertility. The 80</page><page sequence="85">concept of the Bacab as a young man may have originated in the western part of the Maya Low- lands inasmuch as this kind of representation, along with the Bacab-supported bench and the inscription on top of the bicephalic monster, oc- cur at Palenque more than a century before. Summary Nowhere is the Bacab theme more profusely expressed than in Structure 9N-82 at Copan. On both sides of the main entrance one is welcomed by a Bacab with scribal implements, presented as apparitions. Once inside the building, the visitor is confronted with the wrinkled head of a Bacab enclosed within the jaws of the live head of the bicephalic monster - an image symbolizing a posi- tive emanation from the Earth. The Bacabs are seen again, this time as atlantean figures holding up the Earth/bench at the four corners of the uni- verse. One of them has a different attitude and features; he is young and displays waterlily and maize as fertility symbols. Last but not least, the Bacab plays a part in the inscription. In glyph block G he forms one mem- ber of the Bacab/death pair, which elsewhere is illustrated on the supports of the bench from Group 9M-18 (Fig. 71). In glyph block C the old Bacab with a yax under his arm is followed by the tuyotoch expression, translated by Riese as "in his house." If we translate yax as green, the left part of block C would refer to one of the Bacabs associated with the color green (for water or vege- tation?) and a direction(?). If yax is translated as first, it may refer to the earlier Bacab/scribe who seems to have been associated with Structure 9N- 82 2nd. If we give yax the meaning of new (such as in the expression New-Sun-at-Horizon [Rising Sun]), the reference may conversely be to the new occupant of the final phase of the building. There is a remarkable correspondence between the Bacab statues on the facade (assuming they were identical to the Bacab/scribe associated with the first phase of the building) and glyph block C of the inscription. The statues actually may be seen as full-figure glyphs in the round, with the image of a Bacab whose forehead wears T6i4a, otoch. The statues may then be read as "the Bacab (his) house." I further suggest that the pectoral ostenta- tiously worn by the statues, besides being an im- age of the waterlily blossom, is a stylized form of ti6, yax. The jewel and glyph share a trilobal form and an enclosing half circle. The former lacks the dots that usually fill the half circle and the group of traits joining it to the outer rim. In its sense of green, a pectoral in yax form would be appropriate for such real pectorals were cer- tainly made of jade. If my reconstruction is accept- able, the statues would state: "the Yax Bacab, (his) house." Admittedly the occupant of the house must be the "second calendar priest" referred to in the in- scription (glyphs E, right, and F, left; see Riese, Chapter 4). Because the calendar priest's activities included the writing and painting of sacred books, some sort of relationship must exist be- tween the priest/scribe and the Bacab, such as indicated by the Bacab/scribes on the fagade. I suggest that the Bacab as a supernatural entity functions as a sort of patron to mortal priests. In the inscription as well as in the images, the calen- dar priest places himself under the protection and patronage of the Yax Bacab to the extent that he calls his house the House of the Bacabs. This special relationship is easy to understand; the calendar priest's main task is divination, so the Bacabs are for him of considerable importance as year-bearers. As Landa states: And they [the Indians] distinguished the calamities and fortunate events which they said must happen during the year of each one of them [the Bacabs ], and of the letters [the dominical letters, equivalent to what we call year-bearers], which accompany them. (Tozzer 1941: 136) Were the Bacab/scribes writing mens' destinies? 81</page><page sequence="86">CHAPTER 4 The Inscription on the Sculptured Bench of the House of the Bacabs Berthold Riese Introduction The main feature of the central room of the House of the Bacabs is an elaborately carved bench just over 6 m long (Figs. 13, 14). An in- scription is sculpted in well-rounded relief on the outward-facing (north) side of the bench and can be completely seen and read only if one moves inside the room from left to right along the length of the bench. When the central room was intact and roofed, the inscription would have been barely visible, with only a short segment showing through the wide front doorway. It must, therefore, be classified as a private text in contrast to public inscriptions such as are found on stelae and altars. The inscription (Figs. 15, 16) consists of 16 blocks (A-P) of paired full-figure glyphs, one pair of which constitutes each glyph block. Other glyphic elements are to be found interwoven into the paired arrangements. Identification and Transcription of Glyphs Identification of signs, glyphs, and phrases is difficult because there are very few full-figure glyphs available for comparison. At Copan other inscriptions with extended use of full-figure glyphs include Stela D (CPN 7), Altar D' (CPN 82), Altar W' (CPN 101), the bench in Structure A of Copan Valley group 9M-18, and two much- destroyed and not-yet-reconstructed friezes in Temple 11 and 26 of the Main Group. Besides these, there is a fairly general use of single full- figure glyphs in Copan inscriptions that other- wise employ normal glyphic forms. These consti- tute my primary corpus for comparison. Other sites at which full-figure glyphs are found are Quirigua, Yaxchilan, and Palenque. Only Quiri- gua has more than three inscriptions of this kind, but there the use of full-figure glyphs is confined to calendrical statements and thus constitutes only a very limited source of comparison. Once the glyphs on the bench have been identi- fied, the next step is to transcribe them into the system for analyzing manuscripts that was de- vised by Zimmerman (1956) and later adapted by Thompson (1962) to include monumental inscrip- tions as well. Using this system is not entirely satisfactory; Thompson's catalogue does not fully cover head and full-figure glyphs. Nevertheless, I attempt to transcribe the text as far as possible, introducing "NN" for forms not covered by the catalogue, and adding "FF" to indicate full-figure forms; " + " indicates a spatial relation not identi- cal to normal syntactic coordination.

This is borne out by the date and other syntactically fixed glyphs, especially name and title glyphs. Usually Maya glyph syntax is quite strict on its lower levels as well. In this inscription, however, the pairing of full-figures seems to override the syntax on the level of glyph formation and two-glyph phrases. Decipherment and Interpretation The text begins in block A with the tzolkin date 1 1 Oc. The coefficient 1 1 can be identified by the scroll marking around the eye of the human being sitting on the left. The day glyph is rendered as a seated human with the head of an animal not un- like other known head forms for the day glyph oc, surrounded by the usual cartouche found with day glyphs. The haab date in block B has a coefficient of III. Note the ik' sign on the torch or rattle held by this full-figure in its right hand, which serves as the identifying element. This coefficient is fol- lowed by a month of the cauac group (see cauac markings on the person's body). This group is constituted by the consecutive months Ch'en, Yax, Zac, and Ceh. Of these four, Yax is the most probable here, although the diagnostic su- perfix (ti6) is not too distinct and slightly misrep- resented in the drawing of the bench (Figs. 13, 15). Thus the whole calendar round date com- posed of both the tzolkin and haab components reads 13 Oc 3 Yax. At Copan all the benches with carved support- ing front legs comparable to this one date from 9.17.0.0.0 (18.I.771) or later (see Baudez, Chapter 3). The long count position of the Calendar Round date should therefore be placed after 9. 17.0.0.0 and before 9. 18. 10. 17. 18 (6. VIII. 801), the last surely contemporary date at Copan found in Temple 18 in the Main Group,1 or at best slightly outside this time span. These conditions exclude all possibili- ties but one, namely, 9. 17. 16. 13. 10 11 Oc 3 Yax (23. VII. 787). It is very probable that this is the correct reading of the date inscribed on the bench. The inscription continues to block C, left, with the portrayal of an aged person with a scarf around his head, who holds a yax sign (ti6) un- der his left arm. This aged person is probably a Bacab, Pauah Tun, or God N. "Yax Bacab" or "Green Bacab" would be a designation for one of the four Bacabs, or world-direction deities.2 From a calendrical point of view it remains un- clear why reference should be made to one of these deities. The preceding Calendar Round date is neither a New Year's date (1 Pop) nor is its tzolkin- day one of the four year-bearers, which would be Akbal, Lamat, Been, or Edznab in the classical Peten system, and Kan, Muluc, Ix, or Cauac in the Campeche-Puuc system. Both sys- tems are known to have been used at Copan. It is therefore tempting to abandon the interpretation of this glyph as "Green Bacab" and propose that it is, rather, the name of Rising Sun, the Copan "See Baudez 1983, 2, chap. X, sec. B, for a full discussion of the inscriptions from Temple 18 of the Main Group. 2Landa (1959: 62-75) refers to four Bacabs, four Pauah Tuns, four Xib Chacs, and four individually named deities as constituting this group. Here I choose to use the term Bacab instead of Pauah Tun, which has found some usage in epi- graphic studies, for reasons of consistency with the overall text of this volume and because the glyphs concerned are not specific as to which deity name of the complex is meant (see also Houston n.d.). 83</page><page sequence="88">Fig. 74 Rising Sun's name from Temple n (north door, eastern panel: C3-D4), Main Group, Copan. ruler contemporary with the date on the bench. His name can indeed be written this way (Fig. 74). But this apparently elegant solution must be rejected for three reasons: (a) Rising Sun's name is never confined to only this one glyph but con- tains more elements, building up a string of names and titles (Fig. 75); (b) assuming C, left, to Fig. 75 Rising Sun's name from Copan, Group 9, Stela 8: B2-A5 (drawn from photographs; original sculpture now destroyed). Fig. 76 House glyphs from: (a) Codex Dresden, p. 64CI; (b) Chichen Itza, Temple of the Door Jambs: A9; (c) Copan, Main Group, Temple 11, south door, west- ern panel; (d) Palenque, Palace, Tablet of the 96 Hiero- glyphs: B8; (e) Yaxchilan, Lintel 21: B7. be the name of Rising Sun, the syntax of this inscription would be very awkward, establishing a relationship between the same person men- tioned twice. This second argument against the Rising Sun interpretation can be fully appreciated only after one studies the whole inscription; (c) the Bacab iconography of the bench and the exte- rior decoration of the building (see Baudez, Chap- ter 3) makes the interpretation of "Green Bacab" more appealing on a level of overall context than the Rising Sun interpretation. To resolve the problem of the lack of chrono- logical and ritual reference to the world-direction complex, Yax Bacab can be considered the name or title of the actual occupant of the building and not a reference to the deity. As a personal name or title Yax Bacab is also known from the hiero- glyphic text on Stela 3 (CPN 41, B7 lower right). Because these two references are 140 years apart, however, they obviously cannot refer to the same living person. In block C, right, there follows a glyph that can be read tuyotoch (Chorti), meaning "in his/her house." This hieroglyph is confined to texts refer- ring to buildings (e.g., in the hieroglyphic manu- scripts) and/or inscribed in buildings (Fig. 76). 3 If we consider the Bacab glyph and the tuyotoch glyph as a compound forming a short clause, 3See Riese, B. 1981. 84</page><page sequence="89">85 their joint meaning could be something like "in the house of the Green Bacab." I do not offer any specific interpretations for the glyphs in Blocks D to E, left. Although iso- lated elements can be read, they do not convey a meaningful message at this point. According to their textual position, they should constitute names, titles, or similar nominal expressions. Block E, right, can be read ahau k 'in, meaning "calendar priest" in Yucatec and other Mayan lan- guages.4 F, left, can be partially read ka(y) hal ... , meaning "second in a sequence" (i.e., change or succession). * These two glyphs read together would convey something like "second calendar priest." "Second" might be understood in regard to successive occupants of the building. Indeed, an earlier construction phase contained the sculpture of a Bacab with his brush and paint container (Figs. 45-47). 6 These writing imple- ments provide further information on his priestly duties as a writer of divinatory almanacs and reli- gious manuscripts in general. Blocks F, right, to G, right, remain without specific readings or interpretations. They should constitute titles. The person in F, right, is a super- natural being, traditionally called God K, used as a title in many nominal phrases at Copan. The person depicted in G, left, looks much like a Bacab (compare with C, left) but lacks the associ- ated color symbol. G, right, is apparently a death god. Thus block G recalls a similar association of death god images with Bacabs found on the sup- porting legs of the bench recovered by the Har- vard excavations in the Las Sepulturas group 9M- 18. No interpretation is offered for block H, left. The right part of block H pictures a blindfolded person throwing incense {pom, rendered glyphi- cally through T58o°687a) into a spined cylindrical container of a kind found archaeologically in Late Classic contexts at Copan (Fig. 77). Two scrolls indicate that he is burning the incense. This fits well into an overall picture of a calendar priest Fig. 77 Pictures of spiked censers from the Mayan Hi- eroglyphic Manuscripts: (a) Madrid Codex, p. 36; (b) Madrid Codex, p. 39; (c) Paris Codex, p. 17.

Note that today calendar priests in traditional Maya communities make use of in- cense in their divination rites.7 I cannot offer detailed interpretations for the glyphs in blocks I to J, left, but I must remark that J cannot be construed as a child-parent rela- tional expression, as has been proposed by Fash (Chapter 2). The resemblance of J, left, to ti + 122 + 535(^23), as shown in Figure 78, the normal form of this relational glyph, is not strong enough to support this idea. Rather, blocks I and J constitute the last part of the nominal clause of the protagonist of the first part of the inscription, concluding in J, right, with the glyph for lord (ahau), rendered as a vulture-headed human be- ing, with additional phonetic marking of the U (T130). Block K contains a paragraph-introducing ex- pression, expanded through incorporation of the Copan emblem glyph, which lacks its usual pre- fix. Paragraphs thus introduced mostly refer to 4See Lounsbury 1973, for the ahau segment of this phrase. The alternative proposed by Lounsbury, ahpo, can be ex- cluded as a reading. 5See Prem and Riese 1983. 6See Webster and Abrams 1983. 7See Tedlock 1982.</page><page sequence="90">Fig. 79 Yaxchilan Lintel 17 (drawing by Ian Graham, from Graham and von Euw 1977). one of the persons pictured in an accompanying scene. This usage is best illustrated by the Yaxchilan lintels (Fig. 79). It can also be seen on the doorjambs of Temple 18 in the Copan Main Group (Fig. 80). A reasonable reading, semanti- cally fitting these contexts, would be u'bah (Yucatec, with close cognates in the Cholan lan- guages) meaning "can be seen." The addition of the Copan emblem in this case might simply hint at the general context of Copan. The u'bah state- ment probably refers to the sculptured image of the ruler Rising Sun situated over the doorway leading into the room where the bench is found, as reconstructed by Fash (Chapter 2) and identi- fied by Baudez (Chapter 3). Block K thus intro- duces a new paragraph referring to a second per- son, whom we will identify glyphically in the following blocks. Block L, left, contains a glyph that, in classical inscriptions, introduces names in general (Fig. 81) - the so-called God C of the Post-Classic hi- eroglyphic manuscripts. No interpretation can be given for the right element in this block, which shows an uncharacteristic young person. Blocks M and N contain the nominal phrase of Copan ruler Rising Sun, Yax Paca(h) Chan Toh (literally, Sunrise Heavens Storm). Rising Sun ac- ceded to power on 9.16.12.5.17 6 Caban 10 Mol (26.

There are, however, two indistinct minor ele- ments on top of the bat's head, which could be ti68. The closing glyphs in block P may be read katun batel. Batel means "warrior" in Yucatec.8 Katun means that he is in his first 20-year period of office, or of age.9 Of these two concurring interpreta- tions, only the reference to office is chronologi- cally feasible, for Rising Sun must have been well over thirty years of age when the bench was carved, and thus would have been in his second 20-year age period. As to the batel office, he must have acquired it some time after his accession to the throne of Copan or else the chronological state- ment would be incorrect. It is not yet known what this batel office really meant in the sociopolitical context of Copan. A linguistically close cognate, Fig. 81 Hieroglyphic text from Grolier Vessel no. 49 (after Coe 1973). batab , is known to have been a high-ranking office in the political hierarchy of Post-Classic Yucatan. In middle-rank Post-Classic states, the batab was even the supreme ruler.10 To extend this to Copan is chronologically and geographically untenable, but there might be an underlying similarity, which gives us some idea of what could have been con- veyed at Copan by calling Rising Sun a batel. Since there are only two further mentions of this batel title at Copan - namely, on Altar K (CPN 22) with the ruler Smoke-Jaguar and on Stela 6 (CPN 52) 8See Closs 1984. 9See Riese, B. 1981.

Fig. 82 Copan, Altar K: 02-R1. The name of Smoke- Jaguar-Imix-Monster with final batel expression. Summary The inscription on the bench dates to 9. 17. 16. 13. 10 (23. VII. 787). It refers to the build- ing in which it stands as the house of a Bacab, characterizes the occupant as a second calendar priest in this place, and finally makes reference to the current Copan ruler, Rising Sun, as the supreme sovereign. There is a unique pattern of Late Classic Copan inscriptions exemplified in this text. Persons of secondary importance can have their own monu- mental records in private inscriptions such as bench panels and carved vases, but they must make reference to the current ruler. This pattern contrasts with other Maya centers where such per- sons are only mentioned in royal inscriptions, and this occurs almost exclusively when they are ge- nealogically related to the ruling king or when they are conquered enemies. If this interpretation of Copan texts is correct - and it must be emphasized that it relies heavily upon my own personal interpretation of the syn- tax and broader context of Copan inscriptions - Copan might be classified from an epigraphic point of view as a place where the supreme ruler allows latitude for personal representation among officials of his polity or perhaps members of pow- erful collateral lineages. 88</page><page sequence="93">CHAPTER 5 Household, Lineage, and State at Eighth-Century Copan, Honduras William T. Sanders Introduction As David Webster pointed out (Chapter i), a ma- jor objective of the Copan project is the recon- struction of the institutions - social, political, eco- nomic, and religious - of Copan at its peak, that is, during the Coner phase. My reconstruction will be accomplished by the judicious application of ethnographic analogies (some of a direct histori- cal nature, i.e., sixteenth-century and contempo- rary Maya, others from a broader sample) to a variety of different classes of data, primarily from surface surveys and large-scale excavations of resi- dences. An additional source of data is the rich corpus of sculpture from Copan, some narrative and historical in nature, some iconographic. The primary intent of the reconstruction is to evaluate the significance of the House of the Bacabs in terms of the overall structure of the Late Classic Copan polity. On the basis of the chapters by Baudez, Riese, and Fash, we have a number of agreements and disagreements as to the meaning of the sculptural facade of the bench and building. With respect to the bench found in the central room of Structure 82, it is clear that the inscriptions refer to a series of titles, the most important of which both Riese and Fash interpret as "Calendar Priest." These ti- tles were given by Rising Sun, the sixteenth and last ruler of Copan, to the protagonist, presum- ably the resident of the building (see the follow- ing discussion) and head of the large complex known as Group 9N-8. The granting of these ti- tles, or possibly the specific title Calendar Priest, conferred the privilege of possessing an inscribed bench. One of the glyphs has been interpreted by Fash as implying some kind of kin relationship of the protagonist to the ruler; Riese believes its meaning is not yet precise enough to arrive at this conclusion. There is also a reference to an earlier holder of the title Calendar Priest, presumably a kinsman of the protagonist. The epigraphic message is carved on the body of the bicephalic serpent which, in turn, is sup- ported by two Bacabs, gods who hold up the four corners of the universe. Baudez also identi- fies the two figures seated on the heads of the monster as human and suggests that one repre- sents a living person (his identification is Rising Sun himself), the other an ancestor. The lower facade on the north (front) side of the building has two niches, each occupied by a sculp- tural representation of the Bacabs as scribes, and the upper register has a total of definitely six, possi- bly eight, life-sized elaborately dressed humans. The two identical central figures on the north and south sides are identified as Rising Sun by Baudez, but as the protagonist by Fash. Neither offers an identification of the remaining figures, all of whom seem to represent a single person. This chapter discusses the function of the struc- ture in the wider context of Copan society and 89</page><page sequence="94">polity and develops some preliminary models as to the nature of Copanec institutions in Coner times and the integration of this structure with the ideological dimensions of Copanec culture. My reconstruction will be based primarily on set- tlement data. The House of the Bacabs: Implications from Settlement Data On the basis of surface survey, which at the present time involves an estimated 90 percent of the population that resided in the Copan River Basin within Honduras (an area of approximately 500 km2) and on complete excavation of more than a hundred structures, the following general statements can be made about Copanec residences during the Coner phase.1 First, only rarely did the Maya live as isolated nuclear families in the Copan pocket (the segment of the valley in which the Main Group is located). In some cases, usu- ally high-status households, the residential group was large, consisting of a number of such fami- lies, whose residences composed a series of build- ings constructed on platforms and grouped around formal courtyards. The construction material of the superstruc- tures varied from those built completely of bajareque (wattle-and-daub) walls and thatched roofs to dressed stone buildings with corbeled vaults and a series of intermediate forms. These differences, along with the height and mass of the substructures, clearly related to social status.2 Such was the case of Structure 82, which defines the south side of Courtyard A, itself part of a large group that included at least n plazas and irrhis data base derives from three projects: Willey's settle- ment survey of a portion of the Copan pocket and excavations in the house compounds; the continuing surveys from the Proyecto Copan: Primera Fase directed by Claude Baudez, and the Proyecto Copan: Segunda Fase directed by David Webster and me. 2A study by Elliot Abrams (n.d.), one of the excavators of the Courtyard A complex, based on published ethnographic accounts, new data obtained from informants in the Copan Valley, and experimental work, has calculated the variability of labor input of house construction. The estimates vary from 57 person-days of labor for small wattle-and-daub houses with thatched roofs built on very low cobble platforms, to 8188 person-days in the case of the central building of Struc- ture 9N-82 center, the House of the Bacabs. more than 40 mounds (Fig. 5). Excavation re- vealed that Courtyards A and B of the group are built on the summit of a huge platform 70 m (N- S) by 30-40 m (E-W), with other courtyards ly- ing at ground level and ringing this massive sub- structure. The Courtyard A group is clearly the most important one in terms of the size and qual- ity of its buildings and, of course, the presence of the elaborate sculptural facade on Structure 82. Excavation of the group has exposed at least 50 buildings, varying considerably in quality of con- struction, size, and function. One of the most difficult problems in Maya archaeology has been ascertaining the function of buildings, particularly in the case of so-called pub- lic buildings (e.g., in the Main Group at Copan). This is also somewhat of a problem with residen- tial architecture in general because buildings as a whole were kept relatively clean of refuse. In the case of Copan, however, a combination of archi- tectural features and plans, associated artifact con- centrations either within or near buildings, and burial distribution in terms of location, age, and sex, have provided us with a reasonably clear pic- ture of the composition of Maya households and the uses of the various structures that comprise them (for visual orientation for the following dis- cussion, the reader is referred to Figs. 4 and 5). The great majority of buildings that we have investigated at Las Sepulturas consist of rooms al- most fully occupied with high, spacious masonry benches, and these rooms are relatively free of re- fuse. These structures are probably equivalent to what Mesoamerican peasants today refer to as ca- sas, which have primarily dormitory functions. All of our archaeological examples on all social levels involve small rooms and structures, even in terms of peasant standards of housing today, and appar- ently these served primarily as shelter. Most work activities took place in courtyards, on front terraces - which probably had pent roofs - or on substructures that had either open shed-like build- ings or ones constructed of perishable materials on their summits. Several structures in each com- pound seem to have served as communal kitchens for the group. Other functional types include stor- age buildings or rooms, bachelor's houses, tem- 90</page><page sequence="95">pies, shrines, and craft workshops. The reasons for the identification of these functions are summa- rized in Table 2 (pp. 92-95). A word of caution: One should not place too much stress on the single function identification that the table implies be- cause data from ethnographic analogy suggest that strict definition of function was never a feature of most traditional housing. For those structures classified as dormitories there are three basic building plans, which I will refer to as Types A, B, and C. Type A is usually built completely of masonry with dressed stone walls and either a corbeled or a beam-and-mortar roof (e.g., Structure 9N-82 center in Courtyard A, Structure 69 in Courtyard C; see Figs. 5, 10, 62). In a few cases, however, the roof may have been of thatch. They are all well constructed and placed on high substructures. The floor plan con- sists of a central room with two lateral chambers. In most cases one lateral room has no exterior doorway and connects directly with the central room, while the other has its own separate access on the short side of the building and no direct access to the central room. We will refer to this as Type Ai (e.g., see Structure 97 in Courtyard E, Fig. 5). The central building of Structure 82, in an earlier phase, was a structure of this type. It had its own separate substructure, and the east room had direct access to the central room; at a later phase the doorway was walled up. Subtype A2 has two lateral chambers, both with direct access to the central room and no independent access. In the case of some structures of the Type Ai, the room having direct access to the central room does not have a bench, but the other room always does. In some cases both rooms have benches. In the case of Type A2 (see Structure 195, Fig. 4), of which there are very few in our sample, neither of the two lateral rooms has a separate bench. Type B is a tandem arrangement of rooms, each with its own access on the front terrace and no mutual communication (e.g., Structure 83 in Courtyard A; see Fig. 7). Each room has its own bench. In some cases, several buildings in this arrangement or a combination of Types A and B were strung together on a single platform in a later phase by filling in the intermediate corri- dors. In the case of Structure 82, the central build- ing and its accompanying east and west structures form a single line of rooms facing on the terrace. Construction materials are highly variable in the tandem-type house. Types A and B seem to be limited to high- status compounds. Most lower-status compounds have single houses (Type C) constructed on very low platforms, sometimes with low apron-like terraces added to them (see Fig. 4a). The building itself usually consists of one main room, occasion- ally with a lateral chamber and usually with a separate entryway. Courtyard A, as a group, is composed of build- ings of these described types and, in this respect, is similar to other courtyard groups. It does, how- ever, have some unique features. The large open space between Structure 81 to the west and the west superstructure of Structure 82 functioned as a work area. This space probably had a thatched roof but was without walls. The building on Structure 81 obviously has a connection with the ball game, given the type of paraphernalia on its floor as described by Webster (Chapter 1). It also differs from normal residences in its spaciousness, unusual bench configurations, and especially in its associated ritual vessels and facade sculpture. Our data suggests two possible models of its function and cannot discriminate between them. One possi- bility is that it functioned as a special shrine for the preparatory rituals we know accompanied the game, where sacred paraphernalia such as yokes and hachas were stored, and as a kind of club- house for the ball players. The other possibility is that it was an extension of the bachelor's house concept. We know that boys and unmarried men were lodged in separate houses by the Conquest period Maya. They were provided with food by their families but slept at the house. Possibly Structure 81 was a special clubhouse - a residence for unmarried ball players. Structure 80 is identi- fied as a temple, probably dedicated to the cult of the ancestors, on the basis of the criteria indicated in Table 2. Structure 83 and the western and east- ern superstructures of Structure 82 are typical tandem-type dwellings.

The central building of Structure 82, in its early phase at least, has the typical plan of a Type A 1 residence. The courtyard, and the group in general, has less domestic refuse than other groups excavated, but it is abundantly clear from the nature of that refuse that the group functioned as a residence. This low density of refuse reflects the general high status of the occupants. In this connection, Structure 78, excavated as part of the Courtyard H group, is of particular interest (Fig. 5). Excava- tion revealed that it faced Courtyard A and un- doubtedly served as a kitchen. We found very heavy concentrations of sherds, primarily from serving vessels, along with dense concentrations of used obsidian blades. We suspect that, mini- mally, it served all the occupants of the court and was the kitchen of the group. Its location, some- what outside of the courtyard itself, strongly sug- gests that the food may have been prepared by personnel other than the women residing in the compound. The location might also be inter- preted as indicating that the kitchen served to pre- pare festive foods for the entire kin group. We have 24 obsidian hydration dates from Structure 78 - principally from the deep midden of domestic refuse that accumulated between it and Structure 76 immediately to the north (Fig. 5). These dates clearly show that the area was heavily in use beginning in the early eighth cen- tury and continued to be used well into the elev- enth century, with a particularly intensive period of use between a.d. 800 and 1000. This obsidian chronology is consistent with the occupational his- tory of Courtyard A as discussed by Webster (pp. 35-39). The discovery of burials placed underneath the courtyard floor along the fronts of Structures 82 and 83 also confirms the function of the courtyard group as primarily residential - this is a typical pattern found in all the other residential groups at Copan. Based on analogy with these other groups (e.g., Structure 195 in Group 9M-22A, Structure 189, Group 9M-22B, and Structure 97 in Group 9N-8 in Courtyard E), a major tomb should lie under the staircase of the central building of Struc- ture 82. Unfortunately, trenching was not carried out at the suspected location because of the unusu- ally good preservation of the substructure and our plans for future restoration. An alternate possibil- ity is that men of a status sufficiently high to occupy a structure as impressive as the House of the Bacabs were buried in the royal compound (see Rathje 1970). In summary, the overwhelm- ing evidence from comparative architecture and associated features is that the Courtyard A group had a primarily residential function. An interest- ing question is the reason for the variation in plan of what we are calling dormitories. This has mainly to do with the fact that high-status Maya men in Copan (and this is based on specific ethno- graphic analogy from the Conquest period Maya and general analogy from a broad range of strati- fied societies, primarily African, as well as royal Maya inscriptions) had large polygynous house- holds. In polygynous societies in West Africa, for example, the household head usually had a sepa- rate residence, and his wives and their dependent children live either in separate buildings arranged in a compound or in rooms in a large structure (Schwerdtberger 1982). Following this analogy, Structure 82 center would have been the residence of a compound head and the two flanking build- ings, added at a later date, the apartments of his wives. Structure 83 has a multiple room arrange- ment and could have been the polygynous house- hold of his heir. Alternatively, it could have been the residence of other wives of the head of the compound. If this interpretation is correct, the changing floor plan of the central building is of consider- able interest (Figs. 17-21). To recapitulate, in its initial phase the ground plan was similar to a num- ber of other structures excavated by the project (such as Structure 69 in Plaza C, Structure 67 in Plaza B, Structure 97 in Plaza E, and all courtyard complexes of Group 9N-8) in that it included a central room and two lateral chambers, only one with direct communication to the central room. At a later date the door to the east room was sealed up, and the corridor room complex was constructed between the west and central build- ing. In terms of access, the corridor rooms were 96</page><page sequence="101">integrated with the west room of the central build- ing. The back room of this corridor complex is featureless, but the front room has a small bench and several wall niches. Niches of this type occur at Copan in a number of rooms and are also found inset into staircases of substructures. In sev- eral cases we found a single small pottery vessel in situ either within the niche or broken in front of the niche. The small sizes, limited numbers, and variable positions of these niches clearly indicate that they are not storage cupboards for ordinary kitchen ware, but rather must have had some nondomestic function. Another, more inferential piece of information is necessary before attempting a reconstruction of the obviously complex function of Structure 82. The most elaborate tombs found during our proj- ect are in the form of rectangular chambers with dressed stone walls and either corbeled or slab roofs. These always contain a single mature adult male skeleton extended on the floor with ceramic offerings placed in wall niches. On the basis of these considerations, during its initial phase the central building probably con- sisted of a throne room - the central room (Room 1), which functioned primarily for ceremonial and political gatherings of high-status individuals of the expanded kin group to be described below, with the bench as a seat, or throne, for the head. The east room (Room 5) probably functioned as his sleeping quarters. The west room (Room 6) may have been the residence of his head wife or possibly was used to house daughters of marriage- able age. The idea of a separate residence, either a building or a room, for adult unmarried men and women is a common ethnographic pattern in West African societies, and, as I pointed out in my discussion of the function of Structure 81, this was a feature of Conquest period Maya cul- ture. Considering this latter ethnographic ana- logue, perhaps only young women were housed in rooms attached to the head's residence. One or the other arrangement suggested here is probably the case with all of the Type A residences we excavated during the season. When the plan was altered, the function was reversed in terms of the use of the lateral cham- bers; the west room became the head's dormi- tory. With respect to the corridor complex, the front room probably had primarily ritual func- tions. Because of the presence of the niches and the resemblance of the room to the tombs, I would suggest that this was a private ancestral shrine of the compound head who made periodic food offerings to his immediate ancestors. This, again, is a common pattern in Africa where ances- tral cults, as among the Maya, were tightly inte- grated with household ritual (Herskovits 1938; Ojike 1946). It should also be pointed out that shrines directly associated with houses have been excavated at the archaeological site of Mayapan in northern Yucatan (Smith 1962; Proskouriakoff 1962). The back room of the corridor complex probably functioned primarily as a storage area. With respect to the iconography and the epi- graphic narrative of the bench of the central build- ing, we have a characteristic combination of politi- cal and religious symbolism that is a common feature of elite art in agrarian states. It is precisely because of this integration that archaeologists in the Maya area confuse the situation by labeling many buildings as temples which, in fact, had primarily residential functions. The status and roles of a man like the head of Courtyard A in such societies are almost always multifaceted, that is, he is a political leader with supporting clients, he is the leader of a corporate economic institu- tion, and he is a priest. There is increasing evi- dence that, among the Maya, ancestral cults may have been of considerably greater significance than the cults of the high gods - another fascinat- ing West African parallel - and heads of large, ex- panded kin groups clearly would have played a major priestly role in conducting ceremonies and rituals in honor of both immediate and remote ancestors. Throughout much of Maya history, the priesthood as a separate and distinct institu- tion probably was, if not absent, at least rare. The head of Courtyard A was obviously one of the most important men in the Copan polity, rank- ing second possibly only to Rising Sun himself. This statement is based not only on our investiga- tions of Courtyard A but also on evidence obtained from the broader context of our settlement survey. 97</page><page sequence="102">I have pointed out previously that the typical Coner-phase Maya household was physically ex- pressed in a single courtyard group. Courtyard A, however, is part of an expanded domestic group of a much larger size that includes at least 10 courtyards, young men's houses, temples, shrines, storage rooms and buildings, kitchens, work areas, craft workshops, and at least 40 casas - structures to which we have assigned a pri- marily dormitory function (Fig. 5). We suspect that the entire domestic group had a population in excess of 200 people. Most of the buildings in the group had dressed masonry walls, and at least a third of the casas had either beam-and-mortar or corbeled roofs. The residents of some of the struc- tures, such as Structure 69 of Courtyard C, Struc- ture 97 of Courtyard E, and Structure 67 of Courtyard B, must have had relatively high status within the large expanded group. The courts of these three courtyard groups, along with that of Courtyard A, are characteristi- cally very spacious and contrast very sharply with the situation in the courtyard groups H and D. These groups, with their dense concentration of rooms and reduced courtyard space, suggest significant differences in status between these two parts of the overall group. Confirming evi- dence in the form of craft workshops indicates that some of the houses were occupied by profes- sional craftsmen: in one case, shell and stone carvers (Structure 110B); in another, weavers (Structure 110C). There are also important differ- ences in burial customs and layouts of temples and shrines in Courtyard D suggesting that the residents were probably non-Maya foreigners who were presumably clients of the protagonist of the bench. In summary, the protagonist was the head of an immediate household that was very large, internally stratified, characterized by some level of economic specialization, and possi- bly ethnically diverse. Comparison of the House of the Bacabs with Other Elite Complexes: Settlement Implications In Willey's 1975-76 survey, the house groups of the valley were ranked in four main status lev- els numbered from 1 to 4, as Webster has indi- cated. The distinction is primarily based on the height of the highest mound (in general this extra height is due to the presence of a masonry build- ing with a vaulted roof on the summit, but such buildings also often have higher substructures) but also includes the criteria of the size of the group and surface evidence of the quality of con- struction. An additional type consisted of small isolated residences. Group 9N-8 was the largest and most imposing of all the Type 4 groups. In the valley as a whole, there are approximately 19 Type 4 groups (including now destroyed sites un- der the modern towns of Copan and Santa Rita); the next lowest level, Type 3, includes 30 cases. We know, on the basis of Willey's excavation, that at least one of the Type 3 groups, CV43, has a structure with an inscribed throne, and our own excavations at 9M-22A (another Type 3 com- pound) revealed a building with a sculptural fa- cade. Presumably all Type 3 and 4 compounds have at least one structure with either a bench, a sculptural facade, or both. Of the elite Type 3 and 4 sites, 23 are located in the small compact area near the Main Group that we refer to as the urban nucleus, and 37 of the 49 are located within the Copan pocket, a segment of the drainage basin that includes some $0 km2 of alluvium, foothill, and steep hillsides. All of these groups lie within a radius of 8 km of the Main Group and most of them within a radius of 5 km. Our surveys indi- cate that approximately 80-85 percent of the population of the entire drainage basin (in Hondu- ras) resided in this same area (about 15,000- 21,000 people). The remainder of the drainage basin of some 500 km2 had only 3000-4000 resi- dents (see Webster and Freter n.d.). Because of the overcrowding of the Copan pocket, we also estimate that the population was at least double the local carrying capacity, and so it must have been necessary for surplus foods to have been produced and transported to the pocket from the more lightly settled hinterlands. A con- ceivable economic model would be that the popu- lation of the hinterlands consisted of "free" pro- ducers (i.e., farming families with direct access to small holdings) who produced surpluses of agri- cultural products, some of which were paid to the 98</page><page sequence="103">state as taxes and some traded in the market for craft products. The fact that the population of the hinterlands was proportionately so small, and that a high percentage (over 60 percent) of them resided in single-family dwellings and clusters of such dwellings, suggests an alternative model. Ru- ral producers may have been politically and eco- nomically dependent on the high-status com- pounds in the Copan pocket (i.e., they were not economically independent rural landholders) and integrated with the core population through kin- ship and related ancestral cults. In support of this model is the fact that very few burials have been found during excavations in these outlying settle- ments. These excavations include 474 test-pits in approximately 38 percent of the rural mounds. Webster has also completely excavated eight rural sites, and none of those dating to the eighth and early ninth centuries has produced any burials. Presumably deceased kinsmen were brought to the central community for burial and cult activi- ties. If this model is correct, then the head of a large compound of the type such as Group 9N-8 probably had an even larger number of kinsmen attached to his household and an even greater eco- nomic and political power base. This arrange- ment of land use and social structure is found among the Yoruba of Nigeria; many aspects of Yoruba society and economy provide excellent models for Late Classic Copan (see Forde 195 1). With this rich data base from both survey and excavations, we are now in a much better posi- tion to shed light on a major problem of Classic Maya archaeology: the nature and functions of what we used to refer to as the ceremonial centers of Maya polities. The elucidation of this problem is critical to our understanding of the nature of Classic Maya society as a whole, and our views on that subject have changed dramatically over the past two decades of research. Although some disagreement was always evident among Maya scholars, it is fair to say that most of them ac- cepted the model offered by J. Eric Thompson until Tatiana Proskouriakoff s dramatic and far- reaching paper on the nature of Maya writing was published in i960. Classic Maya centers had two major types of structures: small buildings with simple ground plans placed on top of high- terraced substructures and large buildings with complex ground plans on low substructures. Fol- lowing the Thompson model, the former were referred to as temples and were presumably to be dedicated to a pantheon of gods. The latter were called palaces and were interpreted either as the residence of corporations or orders of priests at- tached to the temples or as temporary residences used only during ritual seasons by priests who normally resided in outlying settlements. The as- sociated subject matter of the inscriptions was thought to be primarily calendrical, astrological, and religious in nature, and sculpture in general was thought to represent primarily religious themes. On the basis of what can only be called an epigraphic revolution (as well as through excava- tions of temples, palaces, and residences and via settlement surveys), our views of Maya society, polity, and religion have undergone a dramatic reorientation. The Classic Maya states were clearly ruled by kings who headed large expanded households. Rulers and at least some of their rela- tives and retainers resided in the palaces. The tem- ples were apparently funerary monuments to kings and their ancestors. In fact, it is not an exaggeration to say that the complexes of funerary temples and residential structures that make up the great concentrations of buildings found in Maya "ceremonial centers" are not fun- damentally different in function and concept from the ordinary residential compound, differing only in scale and the obvious increased ceremonial- political functions related to the exalted status of the compound head (for an interesting West Afri- can parallel see Ojo 1966). Unfortunately, at Copan, the Main Group (what I would now refer to as the royal compound, rather than ceremonial center) was excavated at a time when the major objective of archaeological excavation was to re- veal architecture and sculpture rather than to ascer- tain structure function. In reconstructing the func- tion of the Main Group, therefore, we will have to use analogy with our excavated residential com- pounds of lower rank (Figs. 4, 5). In its final phase, the Main Group (Fig. 1) con- 99</page><page sequence="104">sisted of a huge open plaza, defined by a series of specialized architectural complexes on the north- western and eastern sides, which clearly func- tioned as a large open space for public gatherings. Group 3 on the northeast, on the basis of excava- tions conducted by the Copan Project, is now identified as the Maya equivalent of the Aztec calmecac, a combination of bachelors' quarters and school for young noblemen (Cheek and Spink 1986). Group 1, which defines the Great Plaza on the northwest, is unexcavated and of unknown function. The Ball Court and the Temple of the Hieroglyphic Stairway (probably the funerary temple of the fifteenth ruler of Copan) define the court on the southeast side. The palace of that ruler probably lies beneath the mass of the acropo- lis (numerous structures, including residences, have been detected by tunnels). The south side is defined by the huge mass of the acropolis, on whose summit are two courts delimited by a great number of structures. Apparently all of the structures on the summit of the acropolis and a substantial part of the mass of the huge substruc- ture were built by Rising Sun, the sixteenth and last ruler of Copan, during whose reign the sculp- tural bench in Structure 82 was installed (Fig. 13). The summit of the acropolis, then, is best de- scribed and identified as the residential compound of the last ruler of Copan. The sculpture on the summit of the acropolis well reflects the point made earlier, that is, the close integration of the religious and political messages that are typical of early agrarian states. The sculptural facade of Al- tar Q, for example, which was at one time identi- fied as an astronomical congress, is now identified as having purely historical and political subject matter (e.g., see Scheie and Miller 1986: 125). The figures carved along the sides of the altar represent the sixteen rulers of the Copan dynasty. In the front, the first ruler of Copan faces the sixteenth ruler of Copan and is apparently hand- ing him the baton of command. Its political impli- cations are obvious. It stands in front of Temple 16, the largest structure on the acropolis and one that was built probably as the funerary temple of the last king of Copan judging from its imposing size, central location, and facade of sculpted skulls. Structure 11, with its large niches, reli- gious iconography, and position on the south side of the spacious court, probably functioned primar- ily for religious ceremonies. The religious func- tion is suggested by the sculpted figure of the God of Storms and the doorway-like niches; how- ever, all of the epigraphic material, both on the facade as a whole and on the summit temple, is historical in nature - another example of the fu- sion of political and religious ideology at Copan. If we accept this reconstruction, the west court can be described as the administrative part of the royal compound in which lineage heads and other high-ranking individuals participated in religious rituals and political events. It is probably unwise to regard these two activities as being indepen- dent since they apparently were so tightly inte- grated in Copan society. Altar Q, instead of func- tioning as an altar, actually may have been the throne upon which the king sat during these meet- ings. The Great Plaza could have comparable func- tions but on a much larger scale, involving a sub- stantial percentage or even the entire population of the Copan polity (an estimated 18,500-25,000 people). The east court, following this interpretation, was probably the more private part of the royal compound; the obvious candidate for the actual residence of the king of Copan would have been the set of buildings on the north side including Structures 22, 22a, and 21a (Trik 1939; Fig. 6). These three structures, in terms of their overall spatial relationship to each other and their arrange- ment on their substructure, bear a striking resem- blance to the overall plan of the three buildings of Structure 82. This parallel is even more striking when one considers that two of the courtyard complexes in Group 9N-8 (A and B), were built on the summit of a great platform, an obvious analogy to the acropolis substructure. The head of Group 9N-8 may have used the royal residence as a model for his own. The floor plan of Struc- ture 22 was strikingly similar to our excavated Type A residential buildings and most particu- larly to the Subtype A2, as represented by Struc- tures 194 and 195 of Group 9M22A. In all three cases the lateral rooms have direct access to the 100</page><page sequence="105">central room. In terms of their comparative size to the central room, they have a slot-like appear- ance and lack sleeping benches. One difference between the floor plan of Structure 22 and its buildings and structures of the Type A category elsewhere is the fact that the "bench" actually has doorjambs; in effect, the jambs create a back- room/front-room appearance with the back room raised at a higher level. Like the bench in the House of the Bacabs, the riser of this elevated room is covered with a sculptural design, as are the doorjambs and the facade above the doorway. The west room has a small, low bench of a type we are calling work benches. In Trik's (1939) re- port he noted the discovery of sherds from cook- ing ware on the floor and in front of this bench and typically cited this as evidence of a later reuse of a temple after the collapse of Classic Maya civilization. We suggest, in fact, that it might be the remains of some food preparation function for the room. I am not implying that the kitchen was actually located here - this would not be in agreement with the way rooms are used in other residential compounds - but rather that food may have been reheated in the king's house for his use. The reader is referred to Bernal Diaz' vivid de- scription of Moctezuma's dinner, for which young women prepared food on chafing dishes as the king dined (Diaz 1963: 225-226). Structures 21a and 22a have a similar front- room/back-room appearance, for the back room, which is similarly elevated, has doorjambs. We see the presence of doorjambs, however, as sim- ply an elaboration of what is basically a common plan in all of these residences, that is, a raised back area for sleeping. In the case of Structure 2 1 a, this dormitory function is further suggested by the presence of a bench in the front room and by a second-level bench built on top of the floor of the back room (a feature we also find in several excavated residences). Most of the other struc- tures in the east court seem to have been funerary temples. I believe that Structure 18, excavated by Baudez, was the funerary temple not of Rising Sun himself but rather one of his close relatives. Structure 30, with its small size and associated wall niches, suggests an immediate analogy to the corridor complex in Structure 82, that is, it may have functioned as a private oratory for the king conducting ancestral rites. Accepting this function of the east court and based on analogy with Courtyard A of Group 9N-8, I would expect a great number of associ- ated courtyards where junior wives, kinsmen, and clients of the ruler resided. South of the acropolis, at ground level and architecturally inte- grated with it (i.e., the acropolis substructure wall delimits one side of the court) are a number of large residential groups with evidence of ma- sonry buildings and sculptural facades (Fig. 1); this is the area referred to in the literature as El Cementerio. On the basis of the same principle used by Willey in his original definition of what constitutes these expanded domestic groups (i.e., the integration of courtyards by the sharing of common structures), at least four courtyard com- plexes south of the acropolis, with a total of 23 buildings, and an additional 15 complexes on the west in the El Bosque enclave, would have to be considered as part of the acropolis compound. Additional evidence of the dominant status of the royal household is illustrated by Abrams' pre- viously cited analysis of the relative costs of the construction of residences. He estimates the work input for Structure 10L-22 (Temple 22, which we regard as the residence of Rising Sun) at 30,499 person-days. This is approximately four times the cost of the House of the Bacabs. An even more dramatic illustration would be provided by calcu- lation of the relative costs of the great platform underlying Courtyards A and B of Group 9N-8 and that of the acropolis on which Rising Sun's palace is situated. Unfortunately, these calcula- tions are not yet available. Finally, the area we have defined as the urban nucleus consists of at least 1000 house mounds distributed in two clusters on either side of the royal compound, El Bosque to the west, directly adjacent to the plaza, and Las Sepulturas (where Group 9N-8 is located) to the east, separated from the palace compound but connected to it by a causeway. The entire pattern of settlement at the El Bosque barrio of the urban nucleus con- trasts very sharply with Las Sepulturas. First, the 101</page><page sequence="106">El Bosque barrio is physically much closer to the Main Group and, in fact, is placed directly against it. Second, virtually all of the Type 3 and 4 com- pounds in the El Bosque barrio are either architec- turally integrated with the acropolis or are lined up along an approach avenue to the Great Plaza. The bulk of the area is occupied by low-status dwellings. There is a distinct possibility here that all of the high-status residences in the El Bosque ward housed members of the royal lineage, and this fact would mean that the king had a popula- tion of some 3000 people politically and economi- cally directly dependent upon him. The House of the Bacabs: Its Social Significance for the Copan Polity The picture we have drawn of the Copan polity and society in the Coner phase includes the fol- lowing elements: (a) Extended family households varied considerably in social status, with poly- gyny closely related to this differentiation, (b) Households were incorporated into lineages of varying size and generational depth, closely inte- grated with a series of levels of ancestral cults, (c) The heads of maximal lineages formed a noble class and provided leadership in a number of sepa- rate but closely integrated spheres of activities - political, economic, and religious. The immediate supporting households of these nobles included close kin, distant relatives, and unrelated clients; internal rank distinctions were significant. Some members of these expanded lineages had economi- cally specialized roles, but the majority were probably cultivators, (d) At the top of the hierar- chy was the king and the royal lineage who may have had several thousand people as direct eco- nomic and political dependents. Following this model, much of what we see in Copan settlement in general, and in the particular characteristics of Group 9N-8 of Courtyard A as well as the characteristic features of the House of the Bacabs, falls into a clear and obvious pattern. While the power of Rising Sun and the royal lin- eage of Copan was considerable, as evidenced by the massive architecture of the palace compound and the size of his immediate and expanded house- hold, the royal institution never effectively cur- tailed the power of lineage heads such as the head of Group 9N-8. Riese notes, in this regard, the unusual access to impressive monuments that nonroyal persons seem to have had at Copan (Chapter 4, p. 88). Haviland (1981), in his study of Tikal, suggests a pattern somewhat similar to this as a feature of Tikal during the Early and Middle Classic periods. He argues that these large kin groups began to break down in Late Classic times. Copan, following this argument, would seem to have been a very fragile and incompletely centralized polity even during the reign of its most powerful ruler. One of the major features of state society as contrasted to rank societies is the emergence of new institutions essentially divorced from the old kin-based structure and created specifically to by- pass and subvert their power. In many fully evolved states, this process advances to the point where larger-scale kinship organization atrophies and ultimately disappears. The Main Group as a whole at Copan has sufficient architectural com- plexity to suggest a development of some special- ized institutions; the calmecac that we identified in Group 3 is an example of this. There is also clear evidence that the last king of Copan was heavily involved in creating a new religious system fo- cused on high gods and that these gods were di- rectly linked to the position of the ruler. This is most evident in Baudez's reconstruction and inter- pretation of Copan iconography. Based on sev- eral papers (Baudez 1986, and this volume, Chap- ter 3), the evolution of regal symbolism can be encapsulated in three phases. The initial phase be- gins with the emergence of portrait sculpture dur- ing the reign of Smoke-Jaguar, supposedly the twelfth ruler of the Copan dynasty. It is at this time that the population of the Copan pocket ap- parently was first organized under a paramount ruler with effective central authority. The motifs on the stelae of Smoke-Jaguar are heavily overlaid with war/sacrifice symbolism linked in some way to a solar cult. The sun is also integrated with a jaguar deity. The ruler's primary role seems to have been that of war captain. During the reign 102</page><page sequence="107">of 1 8 Rabbit, his successor, the jaguar symbolism declines in importance and is replaced with an ophidian deity, and the Sun God is anthropomor- phized. The Sun God continues to be associated, however, with sacrifice, but Baudez believes that earth/ water/fertility symbols are added as a com- plex, linked in some way with royal status. These symbols include maize gods, cauac monsters, the crocodile, and God K. Finally, additional changes occurred during the reign of Rising Sun. There is a renewed focus on warfare, particularly evident on the facade of Structure 18 in the Main Group, where the inte- gration of solar and war symbolism is the major theme. It is also at this time that the Bacab cult, apparently introduced from northern Yucatan, ap- pears at Copan. The picture, then, is that of an evolving religious ideology relating in some way to the changing status of the leader of the Copan polity. It is possible that a separate religious insti- tution involving a professional priesthood ap- peared during the reign of Rising Sun. The granting of titles to lineage heads, along with sculptural facades on their houses, can be seen as an expression of both the weaknesses and strengths of the state of Copan. The unique re- gional pattern in which the great majority of the population, and particularly the high-ranking no- bles, resided within a short distance of the court can be viewed both as having a coercive aspect, that is, a requirement by the king designed to al- low him to keep an eye on the activities of these lower-ranking but politically powerful individu- als, and also as a desire on the part of those same individuals to be close to the court in order to safeguard their rights (although there is also a strong historical factor here - the undoubted early settlement of the area of the urban core long before the Copan state emerged). The political situation that resulted was a highly volatile one. The mete- oric rise and equally rapid decline of statehood at Copan (the entire process apparently occurred over a 200-year period and involved only four- five generations of rulers) is clear evidence of this. As Webster has already noted (Chapter 1), we now know that the central state of Copan (in the sense of a polity centered on a single, dominant royal line) collapsed a century or more before the signifi- cant population decline in the valley and that for 100-200 years after the royal collapse some elite elements of the lineage system persisted, including those in the large 9N-8 household. Considering the situation delineated above, it is not surprising that the king rewarded potential rivals with special privileges and that high- ranking lineage heads were able to appropriate for themselves prestige accoutrements and behavior that we might expect to be limited to the royal lineage. Thus we have, on the one hand, the case of a state that was only partially effective in mo- nopolizing force and, on the other hand, lineage heads whose positions were somewhat precarious because of the great power of the royal line. As a result, the high gods of the royal lineages were represented on the houses of high-ranking kin leaders, frequent references to the king are sculpted on the facades of these same houses, and high-ranking nobles used thrones as seats of au- thority in the same way as the ruler himself. As Baudez notes (Chapter 3), the presence of the ruler's portrait on the House of the Bacabs does not necessarily mean that he himself lived there or even had any direct connection with the build- ing, because such iconography is found on almost every sculptured building at Copan. It should be emphasized that honorific titles given to heads of maximal lineages by the king, while they undoubtedly enhanced the prestige of their holders at court, did not of themselves pro- vide the basis for secure power bases. A powerful lineage head, such as we find at Group 9N-8, obtained his status through his position as head of a core population of kinsmen and clients that numbered at least 200, as well as expanded groups that may have included as many as 1000 people. In other words, the title of Calendar Priest was given in recognition of real power but did not create it. In this respect it seems very similar to the kinds of titles granted by African kings for the same purpose, and perhaps is equally insignificant in terms of real economic or political power, such as in the case of the title of Keeper of the Royal Umbilical Cord among the Baganda (After 1961; Roscoe 191 1). 103</page><page sequence="108">Because of the heavy emphasis in the anthropo- logical literature on the growth of formal bureau- cracies associated with early states, it is worth noting here that many early complex societies are court centered. By this I mean that, while there certainly may be formal bureaucrats and adminis- trators, many of the people around the king pos- sess partly independent power bases of their own; such magnates are potential rivals of the king and of each other. Their presence at the royal court is as much to maneuver for their own advantage as to discharge system-serving functions, and many of their titles may be purely honorific. The political structure described here is a classic example of what Richard Fox (1977) has defined as the segmentary state. The features of the palace compound and urban nucleus of Copan could have served as the prototype for his regal-ritual city. Such cities are relatively small in population and function primarily as central places for the residences of rulers and nobles and their expanded households and for religious rituals closely inte- grated in nature and function with political power. Segmentary states are symbolically central- ized, but the political position of the ruler is cir- cumscribed by the power of a class of nobles with separate ascribed prerogatives and resources. An essential difference in the political leadership be- tween this type of state and the fully evolved state with a strong central government can be conceptu- alized by drawing the distinction between court and bureaucracy, as I have already observed. Seg- mentary states are characterized by elaborate court protocol and ceremony, and there are al- most innumerable titles - usually given to those men with independent power bases - that are largely ceremonial in nature. A true bureaucracy consists of persons with well-defined spheres of activity and influence, including major judicial, administrative, religious, military, and economic functions; these positions also tend to be filled by royal appointees, but such specialized personnel often lack political resources of their own. They are the king's men, to whom is delegated what power they possess. One final point that needs to be discussed is the reason for the failure of the Copan royal lineage to create a more powerful political institution and to reduce the power of the lineage heads. In many African cases where strong political structures do evolve, the mechanism is almost invariably that of imperialistic expansion. In the Baganda case, for example, the core state was highly successful in conquering a large extensive neighboring re- gion, including a number of once independent tribes and chiefdoms. The management and ex- ploitation of this conquered territory was appro- priately directed by the royal lineage. The kings then created a class of stewards to administer the conquered territory, and these men were inten- tionally selected from the lower-ranking individu- als of Baganda society. In other words, they did not have an original independent power base and were clients of the king. Thus they became king's men, subject directly to him and dependent on him for their economic wealth, political power, and authority. Because the conquered territory was enormously larger than the core, this new institution effectively subverted the authority of the old lineage heads, which, by the time of Brit- ish contact, were powerless (After 1966; Fallers 1956). This process is precisely what I meant when I said that the state is characterized by the creation of new institutions divorced from the old kin-base structure. In the case of many small Yor- uba states in Nigeria, that is, states that were not able to expand militarily, the situation is much more comparable to Copan: the power of the king is sharply circumscribed by councils of chiefs of local lineages. The abortive attempt by 18 Rabbit to incorporate Quirigua into his politi- cal domain clearly reflects both the desire and the ineffectiveness of the Copan royal lineage to ap- ply this same mechanism, and the lack of success of these military ventures probably restricted state formation over much of the Maya Low- lands. Thus I do not regard the reconstructed Copan sociopolitical structure described above as a feudal one, as proposed by Adams and Smith (1981), nor do I believe that such feudal models are applicable to Classic Maya society in general. 104</page><page sequence="109">Summary In summary, the House of the Bacabs, follow- ing my interpretation, had a primary residential function and included a throne room, two dormi- tories, a connected shrine, and a storage room. It was the residence of the head of an expanded household that included members of a minimal lineage and unrelated clients, some of whom were non-Maya foreigners and specialized craftspeople. He was also probably the head of an expanded kin group that may have had a thousand mem- bers and the holder of various court titles awarded to him by the last king of Copan. Among these most prestigous titles was that of Calendar Priest, and its holder also enjoyed privi- leged use of elite iconography, inscriptions, and monuments, indicating his extremely elevated so- ciopolitical status as a member of the Late Classic Copan polity. 105</page><page sequence="110">Epilogue David Webster In the preceding chapters we have synthesized in- formation and interpretations from archaeology, epigraphy, and iconography in order to under- stand the implications of the House of the Bacabs, both as an individual structure and as an elite com- ponent of a much larger sociopolitical system. Having done so, it is a revealing exercise to try to imagine what our interpretations would be like were we to depend only upon one such class of evidence. What if, for example, we had explored only Structure 9N82 center (as so many Maya buildings have been explored) with a limited test trench through its center, revealing the Hiero- glyphic Bench but only a few sculptural elements from the facade of the building and few architec- tural details? We would know that we were deal- ing with an elite structure of some sort and, of course, the rough date of its construction. The inscriptional evidence for a titled protagonist (the Calendar Priest), for ritual, and for some connec- tion with the ruler Rising Sun would also be clear. We would probably be able only to hazard the guess that we were dealing with a temple or possibly a palace. Such was the conclusion of Willey, Leventhal, and Fash (1979: 40) concerning an elite structure that contained a bench in a nearby Type 3 group. Iconography alone, revealing as it may be con- cerning general themes of Maya cosmology, rit- ual, and rulership, lacks the specificity that allows fine-grained behavioral interpretations. To the Maya themselves, artistic texts may have been perfectly intelligible without accompanying in- scriptions, but they convey much less to us. For example, in the Type 3 group 9M22-A (Fig. 4c) we uncovered a vaulted structure in 1981, which was elaborately ornamented with facade sculpture but which lacked inscriptions. Although we be- lieve that this building served the same function on a more modest level as the House of the Bacabs, it cannot be associated with specific titles, individuals, or rituals, and its precise chronologi- cal and behavioral implications are not clear. As Baudez, Riese, and Fash have shown, the recovery and integration of both iconographic and epigraphic texts allow a richness of interpreta- tion impossible if either is lacking. Had we some- how recovered these data without the larger ar- chaeological context, we probably would be in a position to argue that the House of the Bacabs was an elite residence, but many of our colleagues likely would still prefer to interpret the building as essentially ritual in function. Archaeological evidence alone is the single most powerful component of evidence, given the goals of our project. If we had only the results of our surveys and excavations but no texts of any kind, we probably would be able to generate and confirm the same basic model of the place of the House of the Bacabs in the larger Maya sociopo- litical system at Copan. We would lack, however, the precision and independent confirmation of chronology derived from the inscriptions, as well as detailed insights into the way elite individuals related to the royal establishment and to each other. And we would certainly have a much poorer concept of how such elites manipulated ritual and ideology to legitimize and reinforce their positions and vie for authority and power. Because we (and our predecessors) were able to operate on such a large scale at Copan, we can integrate the iconographic and epigraphic evi- dence from the House of the Bacabs with the much larger archaeological perspective not only 106</page><page sequence="111">of Courtyard A, but also of Group 9N-8 as a whole, and on the highest level the regional Copan settlement system. This perspective leaves little doubt that the original ranked residential unit hypothesis that was developed during the Harvard project i!s correct in general terms. Our conclusions as presented above are not, however, like Maya glyphs themselves, written in stone. Many of our own data from Copan must still be analyzed in detail, including most of the artifacts and their distributions, and these will, no doubt, hold some surprises for us. We also expect refinements in the near future, on the basis of ongoing fieldwork, of our population esti- mates and of our obsidian hydration dates, both of which will probably shift slightly. But very likely the general conception of sociopolitical structure and change derived from the excavation data is valid, simply because the weight of the evidence of all kinds is so great. This is not necessarily true for interpretations of texts, which are more dynamic. Samples of textual materials are small and sometimes fortu- itously recovered. Breakthroughs in decipher- ment are common and often unanticipated. Quite conceivably, both iconographic and glyphic inter- pretations at Copan as a whole, and at the House of the Bacabs in particular, will require revision. Hints at some of these changes are already emerg- ing from studies such as those of Fash and his colleagues at the Main Group. Possibly Rising Sun was not the last designated king of Copan, since a shadowy successor - New Bat - may be referred to on Stela U. Rising Sun himself may have maintained his position at Copan for ten to twenty years longer than we originally thought. One of the most fascinating possibilities, derived from continuing architectural and textual studies of Temple 26, is that Rising Suft might not have been responsible for building the great mass on the acropolis in its final phase, but rather that most of the late construction was carried out by his immediate predecessors (Fash, personal com- munication to Sanders, October 1987). If this hy- pothesis proves to be the case, it has obvious im- plications for the House of the Bacabs and its elite occupants. We now associate its construction, and most of the visible construction of 9N-8 as a whole, with the supposed vigor of the reign of Rising Sun; presumably the glory of his court also enriched the great Maya nobles associated with him as kinsmen or retainers. The new possi- bility is that the establishment of some of these powerful nobles actually waxed as Rising Sun and the institution of royalty itself waned, reflecting a process of intra-elite competition that under- mined kingship. But interesting and informative as these new dis- coveries may be, at best they will necessitate only some fairly minor tinkering with the Copan ar- chaeological sequence as we now understand it. As Sanders points out (Chapter 5), the significance of our current model of Maya sociopolitical institu- tions at Copan, which emphasizes the importance of ranked, corporate kinship groups, is that it links the Maya with a much larger sample of similar systems known from the ethnohistoric and ethno- graphic literature. It is the realization that the Maya make sense in this broader, comparative framework that I find the most satisfying result of our work. Such a realization has been long in com- ing, and one hopes that the recent Copan research will help further to correct the notion, so cherished by previous generations of Mayanists, that the Classic Maya were somehow unique in their "theo- cratic" sociopolitical arrangements. That the Maya were such superb and copious artists and, even more important, that they left us an intelligible record of dates and inscriptions is indeed unique. Many scholars still prefer to view these texts only within the highly particularistic context of Maya culture history. This view is unquestionably valid but needlessly parochial. I have long believed that the ultimate value of these unique data is their use- fulness in reconstructing, in detail perhaps impossi- ble elsewhere, an account of the evolution and structure of a complex society and culture broadly representative of others we will never be able to understand in such detail. What is unique about the Maya - their texts - may, ironically, prove to be of greatest value in establishing more convinc- ing, uniformitarian insights into general cultural evolution. 107</page><page sequence="112">APPENDIX The Original Location, Date, and Possible Implications of Altar W' David Webster Introduction Altars are among the most numerous and con- spicuous of the public monuments at Copan. They are not only aesthetically impressive, but often bear inscriptions and dates referring to po- litical and religious events. During the Late Clas- sic period they are almost entirely confined to the royal establishment at the Main Group, although a few also occur elsewhere, most notably in Groups 9 and 10, located, respectively, in the modern town and the cemetery of Copan. The latter areas also produced some of the latest carved stelae in the valley, dating to the last de- cade of the eighth century, that is, to the end of the reign of Copan's last great king, Rising Sun. Altars and stelae exhibit strong co-variation in specific and general location. Because stelae are clearly politically significant monuments dedi- cated to the glorification and legitimization of Maya rulers, the associated altars have, by impli- cation, the same function, at least in part, and may be considered royal monuments. Where ico- nography and inscriptions are well preserved and understood this association is sometimes blatantly the case, as in the famous Altar Q in the West Court of the acropolis at Copan. Given this asso- ciation with rulership, the discovery of altars at some distance from the Main Group at Copan raises important questions concerning the statuses of the groups living in the architectural groups at which they are found. We will probably never understand adequately the significance of those altars found in Groups 9 and 10, for the sites themselves have been largely destroyed; in any case, as mentioned above, royal stelae come from the same general area. More interesting and explicable are the implications of Altar W' (Fig. 83), which was found during the first Peabody Museum Expedition of 1891-92. The monument is discussed by Morley (1920: 13, 330-334)&gt; and the following discussion of its date and location derives from that source. Location of Altar W' Morley's description of the original location of Altar W' includes the following pertinent infor- mation: (1) It was found in a group located 1 km east of the north end of the Main Group. (2) It was on the west side of the Copan River. (3) It was in the center of a courtyard, sur- rounded by structures. (4) The group (later called Group 5) was an impressive one, with architecture of well- cut stone and with sculpture visible among the debris of all the structures, and espe- cially the southern one, which Morley calls a "temple. " Unfortunately, when the monument was recov- ered there was no adequate map of the urban 108</page><page sequence="113">Fig. 83 Altar W' Copan, as illustrated in Morley 1920: 331; (a), front, (b,c), sides, (d) back. zone, so Morley's description is all we have to go on, except for a photograph taken in 191 7 show- ing Altar W' in place, with a large mound in the background. Early in our excavations in 1980-81, as the com- plexity of Group 9N-8 became apparent, Abrams and I became increasingly convinced that Altar W' had probably come from Courtyard A. This seemed more and more likely as additional exca- vation data came in from surrounding groups during the 1982 season. By then we were suffi- ciently sure of this interpretation that we in- cluded it in our preliminary article on Courtyard A (Webster and Abrams 1983). Our reasoning was as follows: (1) Judging from both Morley's account and our understanding of the general context of such monuments, Altar W' must have come from a major outlying elite complex, undoubtedly one of those designated Type 4 in the Harvard hierarchy. (2) Morley's distance estimate was incorrect: traveling 1 km due east of the north end of the Main Group puts one on the east bank of the river, whereas Morley clearly says 109</page><page sequence="114">that the group with the altar was on the west bank. Morley could hardly have been mistaken about this point. (3) There are only two Type 4 groups close to the west bank of the river in the area in question - Groups 8M-11 and 9N-8. These are 600-700 m from the Main Group, and given the intervening countryside (espe- cially in 19 1 7) Morley 's overestimate of the distance is understandable. (4) Of these two, 8M-1 1 can probably be elimi- nated for several reasons. First, it is more northeast than east from the Main Group, whereas Courtyard A is almost due east of the north end of the Great Plaza. Second, the southern building of 8M-11 is very low and unimpressive and has no observable sculpture on its surface (the group was tested by Evelyn Rattray in 1982). (5) The 191 7 photograph shows a mound very much like 9N-8-82 in the background. (6) All of the structures in Courtyard A of Group 9N-8 produced some sculptural ele- ments, with the southern mound having by far the most. 8M-11 as a whole does not fit this pattern, nor does any other of the courtyard units in 9N-8. (7) The date on Altar W' as given by Morley falls into the period when Group 9N-8 was experiencing its final spurt of growth. The altar is decorated with full-figure glyphs as is the sculptured bench in the House of the Bacabs, and the carving on the altar is ex- tremely fine, as Morley notes; the bench has similar fine carving. In short, Group 9N-8 is by far the most likely location for the altar. It is the largest and most impressive of the Type 4 units in the urban core and is located just where Morley describes, dis- counting his overestimate of the distance. It has a large and impressive plaza - Courtyard A - which, in turn, has a sculptured building of exactly the kind that an archaeologist of Morley's generation would have been likely to call a temple. Courtyard A nicely fits the description, and no other location does. The Altar W' Inscription Altar W' has a calendrical inscription, now partly destroyed, running around all four sides (Fig. 83). The text begins with a Supplementary Series notation and also includes two Calendar Round dates - 6 Ahau 13 Kayab, and 8 Kan 12 Mol. The latter date contains an error, but despite this, and the lack of an Initial Series notation, Morley was confident that the two dates could be read as 9.17.5.00 (a.d. 27 Dec. 775) and 9.17.5.9.4 (exactly 184 days after the first date). Of these two dates Morley thought the last was "prophetic" (i.e., referring to a future event) and that the actual erection date of the monument was the first one). The Altar W' inscription also appears to in- clude a reference to an individual other than Ris- ing Sun, and the name glyphs of this individual bear some resemblance to those on the sculptured bench from the House of the Bacabs. This inter- pretation, which strengthens the connection to Courtyard A, derives from Riese and Fash (see Webster, Fash, and Abrams 1986: 184-185). Morley notes that Altar W' shares glyphic ex- pressions and stylistic expressions with Altar Q in the Main Group - Rising Sun's genealogical monument - and suggests that it was set up shortly after it. Possible Implications Assuming that we are correct in attributing Al- tar W to Courtyard A, how do we explain its presence there? One possible explanation is that it was originally set up elsewhere (e.g., the Main Group) and was then moved to Courtyard A some time after the royal collapse. We know that a good deal of sculpture was moved about at Copan after a.d. 800, and of course Post-Classic movement and defacement of earlier sculpture is common at Lowland Maya sites. This process is generally considered to have taken place in essen- tially egalitarian contexts, that is, it was carried out by survivors of the Classic collapse who squatted occasionally in elite complexes; either such people used old monuments for their own ritual purposes or mutilated them, presumably in no</page><page sequence="115">reaction against despised or threatening Classic norms. It would be unusual for a monument the size of Altar W' to have been moved any great distance under these circumstances. At Copan, as we have seen, there is compelling evidence that secondary elites long survived the royal collapse. This brings up the interesting pos- sibility that such elites, striving to maintain or increase their own authority in the political vac- uum caused by the destruction of the royal dy- nasty, may have reused earlier monuments. Those elites dominating the 9N-8 group were probably among the most powerful of the survi- vors, and they certainly would have had the labor to move such a monument. That Altar W' seems closely associated with Rising Sun's genealogical monument, Altar Q, is suggestive in this regard. Possession of such an altar might reinforce a con- nection with the former elite dynasty. On the other hand, if this was the intent, why not move Altar Q itself, or even commission the carving of a new monument? Another possibility is that Altar W' was origi- nally erected in Courtyard A, and that the date of a.d. 775 commemorates this event. In this case it would suggest that the elite proprietors of Group 9N-8 were of extremely exalted status and that their prerogatives included those normally associ- ated with royalty. Given the iconographic and textual allusions to Rising Sun associated with the somewhat later House of the Bacabs, this is not entirely implausible. There may even have been a close consanguineal connection between the 9N-8 elites and the royal family. In this case, Altar W' would still be functioning in a sense as a royal monument. The trouble with this interpretation is that in a.d. 775 the House of the Bacabs and its flanking buildings probably had not been built yet. Courtyard A was still a comparatively mod- est group, lacking large vaulted buildings and ex- tensive facade sculpture or a sculptured bench. Why its occupants should be allowed to erect an altar at this point is puzzling. A variant of the former possibility is that the occupants of 9N-8 were very high-ranking elites with their own power base largely independent of and unrelated to (at least in terms of descent) the royal lineage, which recognized their importance by the granting of court titles and prerogatives such as access to carved monuments. Riese (Chap- ter 4, p. 88) makes the point that secondary elites seem to have unusually free access to such monu- ments at Copan. Nevertheless, the monument would still have been erected, as far as we can tell, before the last major spurt of construction in Courtyard A, in all probability during the tenure of the original scribe or calendar priest who occu- pied the comparatively modest penultimate struc- ture of the House of the Bacabs. One final possibility is that the location of the monument is correct, but that the date is wrong, not in the sense that Morley read it incorrectly, but rather that the monument was, for unknown reasons, given a date earlier than its actual erec- tion. In this case, the erection of the monument could have been contemporary with the radical enlargement of the Courtyard A group in the years immediately preceding the royal collapse or could even have occurred after the collapse, as the surviving elites jockeyed for political position. We are currently unable to sort out these possi- bilities. What we can say is that if Altar W' was found in Courtyard A (and discounting the possi- bility of movement by squatters), it is further tes- timony to the extreme rank and authority of the proprietors of Group 9N-8, whether the monu- ment pertains to the period of intense political centralization during the reign of Rising Sun, or to the post-8oo period of elite activity as the socio- political system gradually unraveled. hi</page><page sequence="116">Bibliography Abrams, Elliot M. n.d.
