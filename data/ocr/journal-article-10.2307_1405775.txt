<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Theology of Reinhold Niebuhr Edward D. O'Connor, C.S.C. REINHOLD NIEBUHR is perhaps the most influential ex- ponent of a Protestant view of life in modem America. While American Protestants today seem to be shifting their attention from Niebuhr to Paul Tillich, this recent trend is still far from counterbalancing the dominant position held by Niebuhr from the early thirties well into the fifties. And even Tillich's in- fluence is, in a sense, an extension of Niebuhr's, for it was Niebuhr who brought Tillich to this country from Germany in 1933. Also, the latter's ontology is, on the whole, perhaps more complementary than contradictory to the ethics of Niebuhr. Although Niebuhr's thought is centered around questions of social ethics, it ranges upwards into theology and downwards into economics and politics. We are concerned here only with his the- ology. As he has never written a systematic treatise in this field, his theological views have to be abstracted from his ethical writings1 and fitted together into a system. Such an undertaking, risky in any event, is, in Niebuhr's case all the more difficult, but also more necessary, because of certain peculiarities of his style. These can be illustrated by his use of the term liberal, one of the most important terms in his lexicon, for it designates the religio-social outlook against which he has waged war most of his life. The most significant trait of his style is his use of a historian's diction to handle the problems of a philosopher. Liberalism, in his language, does not designate any pure intellectual type or essence, a precise doctrine or tendency, but a historical conglomerate of doctrines and tendencies pertaining to many fields, politics, eco- nomics, theology, etc., the conjunction of which is in many cases contingent. But Niebuhr is never occupied with composing a his- tory of liberalism, or of any other historical reality that he has 1 The work of which we have made the greatest use in this article is The Interpretation of Christian Ethics (New York, 1935).

His almost exclusive concern is to interpret the significance of his subject, often by merely allusive references, and it is sometimes difficult to determine precisely to what aspect his observations are relevant. Secondly, Niebuhr's language is very personal.2 Basically his- torical in type, it has not, however, the precise delimitations that would come from a scholar's methodical research. He himself has admitted that he "did define liberalism too consistently in terms of its American versions" ;3 and one of his liberal critics declares that the liberal Protestantism which he describes exists only "in much popular Christianity and in the extreme views of a few theo- logians." 4 Finally, Niebuhr's use of words often turns on their connota- tions rather than on their proper meaning. Sometimes he leaves the impression that liberalism, in a given instance, means little more than sentimental optimism. An even better example is his use of the terms divine, infinite, and eternal as practically equiva- lent and interchangeable synonyms for the transcendental reality which he opposes to the historic, finite world of observable phenom- ena (cf. pp. 67-69). Thus he contrasts the finite with the eternal (instead of the finite with the infinite, or the temporal with the eternal). The difference in meaning between infinite and eternal has been lost from sight; they are interchanged simply because their connotations are vaguely the same. These qualities of Niebuhr's diction make it difficult to deter- mine precisely what he is affirming or denying even when the general drift of his message is unmistakeable. And the difficulty increases as the passage of time dissolves the historical conjunctions or alters the connotations supposed by any given one of his writings. For a critical appreciation of Niebuhr's thought, there is need, therefore, of a careful analysis which will fix objectively and firmly the meaning of his principal ideas, and correlate them with one another. Several writers have surveyed the entire range of his works and composed accounts of his theology in its historical de- 2 A French student of Niebuhr has remarked that his language creates a problem - not because English is a foreign language to a Frenchman, but because Niebuhr's English is peculiar to himself.

In order to give Nie- buhr's theology the close scrutiny which his style makes imperative, it will be preferable to focus attention on a single representative work. Once we have a firm hold on a single expression of his theology, it will be comparatively easy to discern such variations and developments as may occur elsewhere. The Interpretation of Christian Ethics is one of Niebuhr's earlier books, and, in the judgment of a reliable critic, reveals "the beginning of Niebuhr's more distinctive theology." 6 It was pub- lished in 1935 when the author had decisively rejected the Marxist analysis of the social situation, and was "dimly feeling [his] way . . . toward a realistic and valid Christian ethic." 7 It also has the advantage of consciously and explicitly relating theology to the ethics which has always been Niebuhr's principal concern. It is true that later works "disavowed some" and "amended others" of the ideas put forth in the Interpretation, so that Nie- buhr finally declared himself "not able to defend, or interested in defending, any position" taken in this early work.8 It can, how- ever, be doubted whether any fundamental change of position is involved in these later revisions at least so far as their theology is concerned.9 There are refinements of assertions made too simply or even inaccurately,10 but the essential outlook of the Interpreta- 5 This has been done by Hans Hoffmann, Die Theologie Reinhold Niebuhrs im Lichte seiner Lehre von der Siinde (Zurich, 1954).

"is developed most consistently in Augustinian- Lutheran theology" (p. 90). But in The Nature and Destiny of Man, lectures delivered in 1939 (four years after the appearance of the Interpretation), Niebuhr notes with much greater accuracy that "Augustine is very explicit in his affirmation that the evil of sin cannot completely destroy the goodness of what God has created in man" (I, p. 267). This development is illumined</page><page sequence="4">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 175 tion seems to be maintained. In any case, the Interpretation repre- sents Niebuhr's thought at a decisive moment of its formation, and is a point of departure to which all later developments"1 can be related.12 I Niebuhr's "Conversion" Niebuhr calls his theological position "Prophetic Christianity." He reached it only by a conversion from the "liberal Christianity" in which he had originally been educated. For an appreciation of his doctrine, it will be useful to recall the main steps in this con- version, which was one of the more significant events in the history of twentieth-century American Protestantism. Upon his graduation from the Yale Divinity School in 1914, Niebuhr chose the parish ministry in preference to an academic career, motivated in large part by his "boredom with epistemol- ogy." 13 Although he was eventually to return to academic life and remain associated with it, his interests ever continued to be more practical than "theological." 14 The thirteen years he spent by a remark in the "Intellectual Autobiography" (KB, p. 9), referring to the author's early years at Union Theological Seminary: "I am . . . surprised to note in retrospect how late I was in studying the thought of Augustine carefully." 11 In the field of Christology, Niebuhr's thought seems to have developed noticeably after the Interpretation. Cf. the Conclusion of the present article, especially notes 47-50. Some of Niebuhr's later writings also evince an insis- tence on the personality of God, for example, KB, pp. 19, 432 f., which the Interpretation would hardly have prepared us to expect. 12 The present article was submitted to Professor Niebuhr for examination before the final revision was made. He replied: "I want to express my ap- preciation for the fairness with which you have dealt with my thoughts, though we hold quite different positions. There are one or two judgments which I am inclined to challenge, but they are not important, and so I return this manuscript to you without any suggestions or changes. .. ." (Letter of Sept. 18, 1959). Some revisions have been made in this article since the receipt of that letter; they have not altered the basic judgments made in the original, but only the manner of expression.

Leaves From the Notebook of a Tamed Cynic (Chi- cago 1929; p. 45 of the 1957 re-edition by Meridian Books). Recently, Niebuhr declared that anyone who reads his Faith and History (1949) "would be fair in concluding that I have not, in years of theological study, proceeded very far from my original ethical and apologetical interests" (KB, p. 9). Similarly: "I have never pretended to be a theologian" (ibid., p. 439).</page><page sequence="5">176 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS in a Detroit parish destroyed in Niebuhr the liberal creed which he had imbibed from his father, the seminary, and the divinity school, and prepared the way for the "prophetic" faith which he was to elaborate as professor of Christian Ethics at Union Theo- logical Seminary. The First World War, which began a few months after his graduation, had less to do with his rejection of liberalism than the social injustices with which he came into direct contact.15 Detroit was then in the period of great industrial expansion caused by the automobile industry, with Henry Ford setting the pace. During Niebuhr's ministry there,16 the city tripled in size, from half a million to one and a half million people. Niebuhr quickly per- ceived the injustices hidden under this facade of success,17 and at the same time discovered that ". . . the simple little moral homilies which were preached in that as in other cities, by myself and others, seemed completely irrelevant to the brutal facts of life in a great industrial center. Whether irrelevant or not, they were certainly futile. They did not change human actions or attitudes in any problem of collective behavior by a hair's breadth .. *." 18 This experience and others disillusioned Niebuhr with the liberal "confidence in human virtue which human nature cannot sup- port," 19 and persuaded him that the peril of sin (curiously com- 15 Ibid., p. 5. 16 Father Charles E. Coughlin was also beginning his ministry in the dio- cese of Detroit during this same period. There is, between the early careers of these two men, a remarkable coincidence, which is all the more significant in view of their ideological divergences. Both were profoundly disturbed by the economic injustices they witnessed, and were led to undertake crusades for the restoration of social justice. They even became national figures, one by his books and university lectures, the other by his radio addresses, at about the same time, when the great depression of the early nineteen-thirties accen- tuated the actuality of their critiques. 17 One of his first undertakings was to debunk the highly acclaimed gen- erosity of Henry Ford.

This results in political theories which are not able to cope with the problem of establishing a rela- tive justice in society through the strategic use of coercion, con- flict, and balances of power" (p. 143). In his disillusionment with liberalism, Niebuhr was inclined for a while, like the "more realistic portion" of the Protestant Church at that time, to adopt a radical, that is, Marxian, world view (p. 16). The latter, he felt, "has a better understanding of the depths of evil which reveal themselves in human history," and at the same time "transmutes an immediate pessimism into an ultimate optimism by its hope in the final establishment of an ideal social order through a miracle of history" (p. 18). Before long, however, he came to feel that the Marxist expec- tation of a millenium in which "all social conflicts will be finally resolved and all human needs satisfied" (p. 19) was, like liberal- ism, unrealistic and utopian. Ultimately he was to conclude: "Both liberalism and Marxism are secularized and naturalized versions of the Hebrew prophetic movement and the Christian re- ligion" (p. 17). In both views there is a failure to preceive the full extent of human evil, consequent upon a naturalistic unawareness of the transcendence of the divine; for "the sense of sin is peculiarly the product of religious imagination" (p. 65), since "the sense of God and the sense of sin are involved in the same act of self-conscious- ness" (p. 67). The Marxist influence on Niebuhr was strongest about 1932, 21 in man; faith in his capacity to subdue nature, and faith that the only sub- jection of nature achieves life's final good; faith in man's essential goodness, to be realized when man ceases to be spiritual and returns to nature (roman- ticism), or when he ceases to be natural and becomes rational; and finally faith in human history, which is conceived as a movement upward by a force immanent within it."

But just three years later he was already publishing the Interpretation of Christian Ethics, with its radical criticism of Marxism. Whether it was the "refutation of the liberal and Marxist faith by the facts of contemporary history" that brought him to "a deeper understanding of the Biblical faith," 22 or whether it was this deeper understanding which prompted his criticism of the liberal and Marxist views of human history, Niebuhr is now unable to say.23 The Christianity in which Niebuhr found at least the meaning of existence was not a faith provided ready-made by any of the exist- ing churches. In reacting against liberalism, he had no intention of returning to the type of Christianity - Orthodox Christianity he generally calls it24 - against which liberalism itself had been a reaction: "Orthodox Christianity, with insights and perspec- tives in many ways superior to those of liberalism, cannot come to the aid of modem man, partly because its religious truths are still imbedded in an outmoded science and partly because its morality is expressed in dogmatic and authoritarian moral codes" (p. 4). The authentic Christian message, therefore, was not to be found in either the liberal or the orthodox churches: Niebuhr was obliged to rediscover it for himself. 22 He once declared that "whatever measure of Christian faith I hold today is due to the gradual exclusion of alternative beliefs through world history." "Ten Years That Shook My World," in The Christian Century, April 26, 1939, p. 546. 23 Niebuhr, "Intellectual Autobiography," in KB, p. 9. In fact, he goes on to elaborate a theory of a "circular relation between faith and experience" (p. 16). 24 When he speaks of "Orthodox Christianity," Niebuhr generally has Protestant Christianity chiefly in mind. There is no special reference to the dissident Christian churches of the Orient which are commonly called Ortho- dox, although he would doubtless apply to them also much of what he says about "Orthodox Christianity." The Roman Catholic Church would also be intended in many of his criticisms of "Orthodoxy," although it is occasionally specifically exempted, and is, on the other hand, singled out for some special criticisms (especially for its "demonic pretensions," p. 232). It would be very difficult to delimit with precision the segments of Protes- tantism which he classifies as Orthodox. In the present writer's opinion he has in mind not so much the original Protestantism of the Reformers, as evolved forms of Protestantism to be found in the churches of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (to the extent, of course, that they had resisted liberal tendencies). It would be safe to take Fundamentalism as a clear type of this kind of "Orthodoxy."</page><page sequence="8">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 179 II Religion and the Transcendent The most important concept in Niebuhr's theology is that of the transcendent. It is the heart of religion - at any rate, after the latter has attained a certain degree of sophistication. The best access to Niebuhr's concept of the transcendent will be by way of his ideas about religion itself. Niebuhr sees religion as generated by the human mind's im- perative need of finding a meaning in life: "Religion is concerned with life and existence as a unity and coherence of meaning" (p. 6). The world of observable phenomena appears as a passing flux produced by disordered and mutually opposed forces; but the religious mind finds an ultimate coherence and unity, turning the world into a cosmos. This is accomplished by discovering some center to which other things may be related, and which becomes thereby a "source of meaning" for them. Primitive man may find the "sacred center of a meaningful existence" in "the unity of the tribe or the majesty and mystery of some natural force - the sun, the moon, the mountain, or the generative process" (p. 6). Such a god may create a unified cosmos only within the domain of the tribe itself, and it will need to be superseded by another center of meaning of wider scope: "When experience forces an awakening culture to fit the life of other peoples into its world, it conceives of a God who transcends the life of one people so completely as no longer to be bound to it" (p. 8). The ultimate term of this development is reached in "high religion" which ". . . is distinguished . .. by its effort to bring the whole of reality and existence into some system of coherence" (p. 6). This, however, is not possible except in terms of a source of meaning which transcends "all the observable facts and forces," and a realm of meaning that includes "more than the history of the concrete world" (p. 7). The function of the transcendent in Niebuhr's system is there- fore, to give meaning and coherence to the world in which man finds himself. The reason why it is postulated as transcending the observable world is that it must serve to explain the world in its entirety.</page><page sequence="9">180 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS Niebuhr does not attempt to analyze the transcendent in itself, a feat which he would doubtless consider impossible; he speaks only of the various relationships between the transcendent (also called the infinite, the eternal, the divine, or simply, God, as well as by several terms involving essence, which we will discuss below); and the world (also called the finite, the temporal, history, existence . . .). Hence, it is in terms of its relationships to the world that we must study Niebuhr's conception of the transcendent. These relationships are basically two, inasmuch as the tran- scendent is both the source, and the goal (or fulfillment) of the world. About the transcendent as source of the world,25 Niebuhr has nothing to say other than what is implied in the term itself and the few synonyms (basis and ground of existence) with which it is occasionally varied. Even the term source is not to be taken literally. The transcendent did not exist before the world and bring it into existence; it does not even appear to be a cause simul- taneous with its effect - although this is less clear. In what sense the notion of source can be verified in that from which nothing seems to derive is a question that Niebuhr does not take up. It should be noted furthermore that Niebuhr does not attempt to prove the existence of the transcendent, as philosophers have demonstrated the existence of God. In fact, he would probably refuse to admit the expression, "existence of the transcendent," since he reserves the term existence to the world; the transcendent is said by him to be real, but not to exist. But even the reality of the transcendent, he does not attempt to prove; he merely observes that without the transcendent, the world would be incoherent, whereas "Reason insists on a coherent world because it is its nature to relate all things to each other in one system of consistency and coherence" (p. 75). Elsewhere he declares that "the human mind is forced" to con- ceive each thing in its relation to the "totality of reality";26 and that "it is impossible to live at all without presupposing a mean- 25 To avoid confusion, note that Niebuhr speaks of the transcendent as a source in two respects: it is a source of meaning by being both source and goal of existence. 26 "The human mind is forced to relate all finite events to causes and consummations beyond themselves. It thus constantly conceives all particular things in their relation to the totality of reality, and can adequately apprehend totality only in terms of a principle of unity 'beyond, behind, and above the passing flux of things' (Whitehead)" (p. 66).</page><page sequence="10">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 181 ingful existence" (although even this latter necessity is qualified by "the possible exception of the rare skeptic who is more devoted to the observation of life than to living it .. ." p. 6). In other words, Niebuhr shows the necessity of postulating the transcen- dent, not in the manner of a metaphysician proving that it must really exist, but rather in the manner of a psychologist or anthro- pologist, pointing out a force in man that causes him to believe that it does "exist" (or, "is real"). The second relationship of the transcendent to the world con- sists in its being the goal and fulfillment of life. This is an aspect which interests Niebuhr much more than the preceding, evidently because of his predominantly ethical interests. The goal (or end, or destiny) toward which human life27 is directed is for Niebuhr a kind of ideal world characterized by unity and harmony, in contrast with the conflict and contingency found in the actual world: "The prophetic faith, that the meaningfulness of life and existence implies . . . an end beyond itself, produces a morality which implies that every moral value and standard . . . points toward an ultimate perfection of unity and harmony, not realizable in any historic situation" (p. 106). This unity and harmony affect the relation of life to life (p. 107), and imply that one affirms "the life and interests of the neighbor as much as those of the self" (p. 110). The human mind is capable of visualizing such a state of per- fection, and feels obliged to strive to realize it in the existential world. Because, however, of the degree to which "human finite- ness and sin enter into all human actions and attitudes" (p. 122), the ideal can never actually be attained - it remains for man "an impossible possibility." Human reason . . . is always capable of envisaging possibilities of order, unity, and harmony above and beyond the contingent and arbitrary realities of its physical existence; but it is not capable (because of its finiteness) of incarnating, all the higher values which it 27 In all that Niebuhr says about the transcendent as goal or fulfillment, there is manifestly reference to human life and endeavor, even when he speaks of the goal "of life" or "of existence" without any further qualification. It is man's effort that is conceived as having a transcendent goal and fulfillment. As source, on the contrary, the transcendent is related to the whole of existent reality, not just to human striving. This inadequation between the two aspects of the transcendent is not intended by Niebuhr; nothing in his language sug- gests that he is even aware of it.</page><page sequence="11">182 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS discerns; nor even of adequately defining, the unconditioned good which it dimly apprehends as the ground and goal of all its con- tingent values. (p. 66) Consequently, the ideal becomes a standard whereby the short- comings of man's accomplishments are manifested: "Every moral achievement stands under the criticisms of a more essential good- ness" (p. 218). Man in having to strive for a goal he can never realize does not, however, deprive himself of all reason for striving, or doom himself to frustration; for the transcendent is not only the goal, it also is the "fulfillment" of his endeavor. This is one of the prin- cipal themes of the Interpretation, and like so many of Niebuhr's cardinal doctrines, is not given any rational explanation or analysis. Niebuhr is content to declare that a religion of revelation (or prophetic religion) is marked by ". . . its hope for an ultimate fulfillment of meaning and its faith that the God who is the ground of existence is also the guarantor of its fulfillment" (p. 22).28 More frequently, Niebuhr simply refers to the transcendent as "the ground and the fulfillment of existence." 29 It is clear that this fulfillment is not to be conceived as some sort of heavenly reward given after life in this world is over. Such a notion comes from taking literally a myth that was meant to be understood only symbolically, and produces "historical illusion" (cf. p. 57). We will see below that the myth of the Redemption is a symbolic expression for the fulfillment of man's life by the tran- scendent, and like all great myths expresses a truth that cannot be given a satisfactory rational expression. As conceived by Niebuhr's faith, therefore, the world is as it were suspended between two poles - a transcendent source and a transcendent goal-fulfillment - which give it unity, coherence, and meaning. Niebuhr assumes that the goal at which life aims, and the fulfillment which it receives without reaching the goal, are one and the same; and never even seems to suppose that their identity could be questioned. That this goal-fulfillment must, in turn, be identified with the source of existence, he explicitly affirms, 28 In one of his more recent statements on this matter, Niebuhr declares: "The Christian faith holds out the hope that our fragmentary lives will be completed in a total and larger plan than any which we control or compre- hend. . ." KB, p. 6. 29 It should be kept in mind that (as was noted above) Niebuhr avoids attributing existence to the transcendent at all.</page><page sequence="12">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 183 while recognizing that this position involves difficulties: "Religious faith ... invariably . . . identifies the origin and source with the goal and end as belonging to the same realm of reality, a proposi- tion which involves religion in many rational difficulties but re- mains, nevertheless, a perennial and necessary affirmation" (p. 7). Only when he is dealing with the problem of moral obligation does Niebuhr explain why such an identification must be made, in spite of the "rational difficulties" it involves. Moral obligation is an obligation to strive for an ideal. But an ideal as such cannot impose itself upon us, because it lacks reality. Every ethical system, therefore, "must base its moral imperative in an order of reality and not merely in a possibility" (p. 55).3so It acquires reality if we suppose it identical with the "source of existence," which is the truest reality."3 Niebuhr nowhere declares what "rational difficulties" are in- volved in the identification of the source of existence with its goal (and fulfillment); but it is not difficult to discern at least one such difficulty that this identification encounters in his system. In the Christian faith, God has always been the alpha and the omega, the source and the end of creation, because, having created it, He offers to it (in the person of the rational creature) union with Himself as a goal at which it can aim. This goal is possible of attainment, and when attained becomes the fulfillment of the creature's striving. But in Niebuhr's system, in which the goal of life is an unattainable ideal, it is hard to see in what sense it can be identified with the source of historic being, or regarded as its fulfillment. A clue to Niebuhr's view on this matter may be found in his tendency to speak of the transcendent as essence, in opposition to which he designates the historical world as existence. Thus, he contrasts "life in its essence" with "what it is in its actual exis- tence" a contrast that is the same as that between the ideal and the actual (p. 205). Elsewhere, he refers to the transcendent as "the order of life in its more essential reality" (p. 8), or "its final essence" (p. 9), or "its ultimate essence" (p. 219); and he speaks of "the transcendent unity of essential reality" (p. 213). It is obvious that in Niebuhr's vocabulary the "essence" of a thing so0 Elsewhere he declares: "Somewhere, somehow, the unity of the world must be or become an established fact and not mereJy a possibility" (p. 55). 1s Cf. section IV of the present article.</page><page sequence="13">184 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS means a sort of ideally perfect version of it, like the conception existing with all its purity and perfection in the mind of the archi- tect, prior to the limitations, imperfections, and accidents that will be imposed by the contingencies of the material and the circum- stances involved in its realization. It is such essences that make up the transcendent, a realm in which they are harmonized with one another in an accord as perfect as each essence is in itself.32 Essences so conceived seem very much like Plato's "Ideas" - eternal, perfect forms, of which visible reality is only an imitation or participation. Only once, it is true, does Niebuhr express any accord with the Platonic view of things, when he identifies God, as Judge of the world (according to the prophetic concept), with "the ultimate unity" (Niebuhr's preferred way of conceiving God), and with ". .. the good which is, to use Plato's phrase, on the other side of existence" (p. 37).33 When the transcendent is conceived in the manner of Platonic ideas, it becomes clear how it can be both source and goal of existent reality. It is goal inasmuch as it is a pattern that man is striving to imitate. It is source, not as a maker, but again as pat- tern, a pattern of which actual things are an imitation. In other words, it is both source and goal in the very same sense, the sense in which a pattern is related to the imitation. It is called source when related to an imitation which already exists, and goal in relation to one that someone is striving to bring into existence. But this Platonic perspective does not make clear how the tran- scendent can also be a fulfillment of man's striving. We have seen that Niebuhr does not explain the nature of this fulfillment; in places, however, he seems to suggest that it consists simply in man's conviction that that which he is attempting to realize in the historic world is "already the truest reality" (p. 9). In this case, the con- cept of fulfillment seems to have lost all proper meaning; all that 32 An entirely different reason for identifying the goal with the source is suggested in the following lines: ". . . the insistence upon the Creation as a work of God always saves prophetic religion from contempt for the partial and imperfect values of history and a consequent identification of religion with a passive contemplation of a transcendent ideal beyond existence" (p. 214). 3a It is the "Idea of the Good," of Book VI of the Republic which is here identified with the God of Judgment. But even without this explicit reference, it would be clear enough that Niebuhr thinks of essences (or the ideal, or the transcendent) in a Platonic spirit. Note, however, that the only other explicit reference to Plato that is made in the Interpretation describes him as a "ration- alist" (cf. p. 24 f.).</page><page sequence="14">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 185 is being asserted is that the transcendent essences or patterns are not merely possibilities envisaged by the human mind, but have reality in themselves. What sort of reality they have, however, is not very clear. Nie- buhr himself gives no direct explanation on this point, except to insist that the transcendent does not belong (like Plato's ideas) to a realm apart from the real world, but is organically related to it. What he means by this is a question we shall have to postpone until we have examined his doctrine on myth. What we have seen thus far can be summed up in this, that the religious outlook, whereby man puts meaning and coherence into the world, consists in referring all things to a transcendent center, which is at once the source, goal, and fulfillment of the world. This transcendent center looks very much like an amalgam of the God of Scripture and the Ideas of Plato. Its three functions of source, goal, and fulfillment are those which God fulfilled in Scripture. God Himself, however, has been discredited, and the Platonic ideas have been summoned to take His place. Under the name of "unconditioned essence of life" (p. 70), they serve plaus- ibly as the goal of life (or of the existing world). It is difficult, however, to see any real meaning in their being called a source; and calling them a fulfillment seems to contradict the postulate that as goal they are unattainable. These latter two 'functions' appear to be only empty titles that are retained simply because they went with the office when God held it. III Myth Niebuhr's concept of religion can be called intellectual, but not rationalist. It is intellectual, because it makes religion out to be purely an affair of the mind, a Weltanschasuung rather than an attitude of worship or love of God. Religion "is concerned with life and existence as a unity and coherence of meaning" (p. 6). But it achieves this meaning not by rational explanation, but by means of symbols. Niebuhr mistrusts rational explanation and argument; he uses the very term rationalism with abhorrence, to express his disdain. The view of life which he proposes instead, he terms "mythical religion." Niebuhr's understanding of myth and mythical religion is ex- pressed mostly by way of contrasts with science and philosophy - the two main types of "rational" thought, which he opposes to</page><page sequence="15">186 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS mythical or symbolic thought. Science stays on "the surface" of nature and history, "analyzing, dividing, and segregating its de- tailed phenomena and relating them to each other in terms of their observable sequences." Whereas it "is the genius of true myth to suggest the dimensions of depth in reality and to point to a realm of essence which transcends the surface of history . . ." (p. 12). But in its straining towards the transcendent, the human mind is obliged to distort reality as science sees it,34 and to express itself mythically: "since myth cannot speak of the trans-historical with- out using symbols and events in history as its forms of expression, it invariably falsifies the facts of history, as seen by science, to state its truth. Religion must therefore make the confession of St. Paul its own: "As deceivers and yet true" (II Cor. 6:8)" (p. 13). Myth is therefore the expression of a truth, but an expression which, when judged by science, appears false. It is comparable to the work of the portrait artist who "will falsify, unduly accen- tuate, and select physiognomic details in order to present his vision of the transcendent unity and spirit of the personality" (p. 83). It follows that to interpret myth literally is to pervert it. One of the great tragedies of "orthodox" Christianity was that it read the myths of Genesis as though they were historical records. To have emancipated Christianity from such "dogmatic and literalis- tic interpretations of its mythical inheritance" is one of the "great achievements" of liberalism.35 84 Why is this distortion necessary? Niebuhr does not attempt to give a fundamental explanation. Such reasons as can be gleaned from his remarks will be indicated below, in connection with his rejection of "philosophical," that is, rational explanations. 35 Not long ago, the rise of Billy Graham provoked Niebuhr to make the following clear statement of the positive results of liberalism: ". .. we are in danger of sacrificing one of the great achievements of 'liberal' theology, namely, the absolute honesty with which it encouraged the church to examine the scriptural foundations of its faith. This honesty involved not only loyalty to the truth but also fidelity to the standards of the whole modern world of culture, which rightly insisted that no facts of history could be exempted from historical scrutiny in the name of faith. Christianity was a historical religion. It rested upon the facts of history as interpreted by faith. But the faith would have to be profound enough to remain secure, even though peripheral myths with which former ages surrounded the truth of faith in the hope of validating it were disproved. In short, this honesty toward the scriptural foundations of the faith was not only an act of loyalty to the whole enterprise of modern culture; it was also a method of purifying the Christian faith. For this honesty made it imperative for the believer to accept Jesus as the Christ because the relevation of God in Christ validated itself to him</page><page sequence="16">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 187 The contrast which Niebuhr draws between myth and science is not so instructive as that between myth and philosophy, because philosophy is more akin to myth than science is. Like myth, phil- osophy has a sense of depth, and arises out of a concern for mean- ing. It, too, is an attempt to put order and coherence into the con- fusion of observable phenomena; Niebuhr even speaks of it some- times as "rationalistic religion" (p. 25). But philosophy attempts to give a purely rational account of the world. It rests "its world view entirely upon the ground of rational consistency" (p. 14), and seeks to dispense with symbols and myths altogether. While Niebuhr does not utterly reject philosophy,36 he insists: "Every authentic religious myth contains paradoxes of the rela- tion between the finite and the eternal [that is, between the world and the transcendent] which cannot be completely rationalized without destroying the genius of true religion" (p. 14). This is a proposition which could be held in different senses and for various reasons; the arguments by which Niebuhr justifies his stand must therefore be scrutinized carefully. In one place he declares: "Myth alone is capable of picturing the world as a realm of coherence and meaning without defying the facts of incoherence" (p. 26). This implies that a philosophic system must necessarily ignore or deny the reality of incoherence, of blind force and contingency, in the world; it supposes, in other words, that a rational account is always of a "rationalistic" type, that is incapable of recognizing and encompassing the irrational. One would like to see Niebuhr consider the opposite possibility, or, at least, declare the reasons that preclude it; but he is content to rest his case on the connota- existentially and did not require the confirmation of 'signs and wonders.' It is this distinct gain of liberal Christianity which is now imperiled, with the general loss of the prestige of liberalism and the general enhancement of orthodoxy." - "Literalism, Individualism and Billy Graham," in The Christian Century, May 23, 1956, pp. 640 f. 36 "Philosophy is, in a sense, a mediator between science and religion. It seeks to bring the religious myth into terms of rational coherence, with all the detailed phenomena of existence which science discloses. . . . If theology is an effort to construct a rational and systematic view of life out of various and sometimes contradictory myths which are associated with a single religious tradition, philosophy carries the process one step farther by seeking to dis- pense with the mythical basis altogether and resting its world view entirely upon the ground of rational consistency. . . . This rationalization of myth is indeed inevitable and necessary, lest religion be destroyed by undisciplined and fantastic imagery or primitive and inconsistent myth" (pp. 13 f.).</page><page sequence="17">188 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS tions of the term rationalism. The fact seems to be- and Nie- buhr's own confession of what he calls "boredom with episte- mology" 37 bears this out - that his acquaintance with the efforts of philosophers to formulate a rational account of existence is not very profound. Niebuhr rejects philosophy for another reason that carries still greater weight with him, for he believes that rational thought tends to dissociate the transcendent from the world, to sunder the "or- ganic relationship" (passim) which ought to be maintained be- tween them. His fullest exposition of this disjunctive tendency occurs in a description of how "rational religions" develop into mysticism. "They begin by a rational quest after the eternal forms within the passing flux." But "the eternal forms which give: body to temporal reality finally become dissociated from it" (p. 23). Mysticism is simply the natural culmination38 of this dissocia- tion: "rational observation turns into mystical contemplation as it strains after the final vision of the absolute and eternal . . . the eternal becomes an undifferentiated transcendence, 'a fathomless depth in which no distinctions are visible or a fullness of being that exceeds our comprehension' " (p. 23). Such a transcendent "ceases to have relevance to the historical and temporal process"; instead of being the "ground of the natural," it "is only the ulti- mate abyss of the natural where all distinctions vanish and all dynamic processes cease" (p. 21). We will not here discuss the validity of Niebuhr's concept of mysticism. But his idea that rational inquiry tends to develop into the sort of detachment from reality that he understands mysticism to be, is interesting because of the light it sheds on his concept of the working of reason. He considers the God of the 87 Cf. supra, note 13. In making this remark to explain why he foreswore graduate study and an academic career, Niebuhr seems to take epistemology to represent philosophy in general, at least, as its principal part. In this he is acquiescing in the dominant philosophical outlook of the post-Kantian period. On the other hand, the fact that he instinctively turned away from a philosophy thus centered around epistemology is indicative of a healthy intellectual realism that might have exerted a healthy influence on contemporary philosophy. But Niebuhr, unable to find or to formulate a philosophy that was both objec- tive and rational, turned to a "symbolic" mode of discourse which largely cut him off from any direct influence on philosophical thought. 38Rational religion can avoid this development only at the price of an "optimistic identification of the Absolute with the totality of things, a conclu- sion at variance with tragic realities of existence and detrimental to high moral passion" (p. 24).</page><page sequence="18">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 189 mystic to be an abstraction from the ideas of the philosopher, which in turn have been abstracted from the real world. In other words, God is a kind of divine liqueur, a quintessence distilled from the essences of material reality. "In mysticism the effort is made to penetrate first to the rational and then to the ultrarational essence of human existence in the confidence that man thus pene- trates to the unconditioned essence of life, to God" (p. 70). The supposition that underlies this whole train of thought is that the rational process of abstraction, by which the mind forms its ideas of the experienced world, involves attributing to these ideas a separate existence of their own, just as to God, too, is attributed a separate existence when He, in His turn, is "abstracted" from the ideas by the mystic. Here again it would appear that Plato is slipping unannounced into Niebuhr's thought. When Niebuhr speaks of rationalism, it is Platonism that he has in mind, or at least a Platonic type of thought. This makes it easier to appreciate the motivation behind his unqualified rejection of it; nevertheless, we must recall that Niebuhr's own concept of the transcendent as a harmonious realm of pure essences is itself largely an unconscious imitation of the Platonic theory of ideas, as was noted above.39 In contrast with the "dualism" that results from a rational quest of meaning, an "organic relationship" (p. 264 &amp; passim) between the world and the transcendent is maintained by mythical religions. This is because they * . discover symbols of the transcendent in the actual40o without * . separating the one from . . .the other. This is perhaps the most essential genius of myth, that it points to the timeless in 39Niebuhr points out that the mystical extreme of rationalism which he has described fails to attain even that "final source of life's meaning" for which it seeks, because it "ends by destroying the meaning of life" (p. 23). This critique is quite in the spirit of Aristotle's observation that Plato's ideas "help, in no wise, either towards the knowledge of other things . . . or to- wards their being, if they are not in the individuals which share in them" (Metaphysics XIII, 5, 1079b15). Niebuhr, however, seems not to be aware either of Aristotle's criticism, or of the epistemology which he proposed as proof against such criticism. 40 Note that Niebuhr is here taking historical realities as symbols of the transcendent. The term myth applies most naturally to a fiction by which a profound truth is symbolically expressed, for example, the "myths" of Creation, Judgement, etc., which will be discussed below. But in the "mythical religion" expounded by Niebuhr, the limited goods that man can achieve in the histori- cal world are also symbols of the transcendent.</page><page sequence="19">190 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS time, to the ideal in the actual, but does not lift the temporal to the category of the eternal (as pantheism does), nor deny the significant glimpses of the eternal and the ideal in the temporal (as dualism does). (p. 82) The contrast which Niebuhr erects between the rationalist tendency to dissociate the world and the transcendent, and the genius of myth at keeping them "related," can be understood at two levels, the epistemological and the ethical. In the epistemologi- cal sense, it means that the formulation of rational concepts en- tails a falsification, which is avoided when mythical symbols are used. In the ethical sense, it means that the rational consideration of "eternal essences" robs historic existence of its meaning, because the "temporal and relative forms (of the latter) are believed not worthy to be compared with the absolute" (p. 23 f.); whereas mythical religion, viewing all temporal achievements as related to the ideal (but never identified with it!) gives to the latter their full value. Niebuhr obviously intends both of these meanings, although he does not clearly distinguish them. And as, in general, his con- cern with theological questions is motivated principally by their ethical implications, so here it is the moral advantage of the "mythical" approach to reality that is chiefly in his mind when he contrasts it with the rational. Myth, for him, is not just a way of knowing the transcendent by means of the historical, it is above all a way of clothing the historical with some participation41 in the values of the transcendent. Whether the "organic relationship" that Niebuhr would main- tain between the world and the transcendent be taken in an epis- temological or ethical sense, it presupposes an ontological relation- ship between them. (The latter, incidentally, would not be the same in the two cases.) There is, however, no discussion of the ontology of the transcendent in the Interpretation, and in subse- quent years Niebuhr has steadfastly refused to enter into ontologi- cal questions.42 If, therefore, we ask him how he knows that the 41 This term is not used by Niebuhr. We use it, not in order to emphasize the Platonic drift of his thought, but because no other term seems capable of expressing the relation between the "actual" and the "ideal" which makes us obliged to the former by reason of the latter. 42 Paul Tillich speaks of Niebuhr's "rejection of the ontological question within theology" (KB, p. 36). Niebuhr replies that he does not "depreciate" the Aristotelian rationalism that Tillich is defending, but insists that the freedom of man and of God elude the grasp of a rational ontology (ibid., pp.</page><page sequence="20">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 191 transcendent can only be known symbolically and not rationally; or how seeing human values as a symbol of "the order of life in its more essential reality" (p. 9) gives rise to a moral obligation toward them; or, for that matter, why we ought to view the world symbolically - he can give no reason. These are first principles in his system. Does Niebuhr's doctrine on myth correspond, at least in spirit and intention, to the Thomistic doctrine on the analogy of being? Both agree that the realities of this world, through a certain like- ness they have to the divine nature, give us an imperfect knowl- edge of it. However, the reason why we cannot have a perfect knowledge of God is, according to St. Thomas, that He has (or is) "a fullness of being that exceeds our comprehension" - a notion that Niebuhr explicitly rejects.43 Furthermore, St. Thomas holds that a truly rational knowledge of God is possible (even though it is imperfect), because a proper analogy obtains between God and the world; for Niebuhr, we must distort the realities of the world by myth in order to obtain a (non-rational) "glimpse" of the transcendent. The parallels, therefore, between Niebuhr's myth and Thomistic analogy would appear to be of a very general and superficial order. Niebuhr's doctrine has also been compared to that of Rudolf Bultmann, who likewise uses the concept of myth as a key to the interpretation of the Christian message. Niebuhr himself, however, has insisted on the radical difference between Bultmann's under- standing of myth and his own. Bultmann's projected "de-mytholo- gization" of Scripture presupposes that the truth expressed by myth can be extricated from it and put in non-mythical form - a supposition that contradicts the very foundation of Niebuhr's position. It is not possible to purify Christianity of its myths, ac- cording to Niebuhr; what is needed in order to make the Christian 432 f.). He holds that "the philosophies which emphasize ontological cate- gories, whether in naturalistic, idealistic, or mystical terms, in short, annul man in his undoubted historic existence" (ibid., p. 18). 43 Interpretation, p. 23. The phrase is cited by Niebuhr from Morris Cohen, Reason and Nature, p. 146. We have seen that Niebuhr himself does not furnish any reasons why the transcendent can be known only through symbols. His arguments against philosophical inquiry rest on the supposition that all philosophy is of a rationalistic type; they do not therefore imply any conception of the ontological relationship between the world and the tran- scendent.</page><page sequence="21">192 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS message intelligible to our time is simply to recognize that it is myth, and not read it as if it were history.44 Niebuhr recognizes four great religious myths: Creation, the Fall, Judgment, and Redemption. Creation and Redemption are the two principal ones, corresponding to the two chief aspects of the transcendent, as source and fulfillment of the existing world. But in order to account for the presence of evil in the world, the Creation myth must be supplemented by that of the Fall, and the Redemption preceded by Judgment. "God the Creator" is a mythical expression for the transcen- dent source of existence: To say that God is creator is to use an image which transcends the canons of rationality, but which expresses both his organic relation to the world and his distinction from the world. To be- lieve that God created the world is to feel that the world is a realm of meaning and coherence without insisting that the world is totally good, or that the totality of things must be identified with the Sacred. (p. 26) The myth of the Fall symbolizes the origin of evil. The fol- lowing paragraph gives some indication of the paradoxical struc- ture of Niebuhr's interpretation of this myth: According to the myth of the Fall, evil came into the world through human responsibility. It was neither ordained in the counsels of God nor the inevitable consequence of temporal exis- tence . . . but this responsibility is slightly qualified by the sugges- tion that man was tempted. The serpent, symbol of the principle of evil, in the story of the Fall, does justice to the idea that human rebellion is not the first cause and source of evil in the world. The world was not a perfect harmony even before human sin created confusion. (pp. 72, 73) 44In his "Reply to interpretation and criticism," Niebuhr objects to the equating of his position with that of Bultmann (KB, pp. 438, 446). "I do not think that Bultmann makes a sufficient distinction between the pre-scientific myths and what I have elsewhere defined as the myths of permanent validity, without which it is not possible to describe the ultimate realities in conditions of the temporal world" (p. 438). He even goes on to regret that he ever used the word myth to describe the transcendent significance of Jesus, "particularly since the project for 'demythologizing' the Bible has been undertaken and bids fair to reduce the Biblical revelation to eternally valid truths without any existential encounter between God and man" (p. 439). Although these texts were published twenty years after the Interpretation, they are in perfect accord with it.</page><page sequence="22">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 193 The myths of Judgment and Redemption45 symbolize the tran- scendent goal of existence in its two functions of criterion (where- by the shortcomings of the world are manifested) and fulfillment (in which they are overcome). The myth of the Creator God offers the possibilities for a prophetic religion in which the transcendent God becomes both the judge and redeemer of the world. . . . In genuinely prophetic religion, the God who transcends the created world also convicts a sinful world of its iniquities and promises an ultimate redemption from them. (p. 29) It is an integral part of mythical religion to place the redemp- tive fulfillment at the end of time. Niebuhr criticized Catholic orthodoxy for replacing "Isaiah's hope for redemption at the end of history" with "a reference toward a realm of transcendence above history" (p. 30). Niebuhr justifies the eschatological ele- ment in the ethical demands of Jesus, because "their final fulfill- ment is possible only when God transmutes the present chaos of this world into its final unity" (p. 56). But this defense of the eschatology inherent in prophetic reli- gion should not be interpreted to mean that Niebuhr expects the day to come when, literally, the present imperfect order of things will be brought to an end, and God will set all to right. Eschatology is only a mythical statement, "in terms of concepts connoting his- torical sequence," of a "paradoxical aspect of reality." "Placing the final fulfillment at the end of time and not in a realm above temporality is ... to state mythically what cannot be stated ration- ally" (p. 57). Those who take this myth as though it were literally true fall into an historical illusion of the type mentioned above. IV Ethics Niebuhr's interest in theology is chiefly motivated by ethical preoccupations, and his theological positions are manifestly influ- 45 Note that in Niebuhr's system, Judgment is equivalent to condemnation and precedes Redemption. This manner of relating Judgment and Redemp- tion has a certain scriptural foundation, particularly in the Old Testament; but it is also dictated by the logic of Niebuhr's system.</page><page sequence="23">194 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS enced by ethical convictions. Moreover, the present summary of his theology has been abstracted from a theory of Christian ethics. An adequate appreciation of his theology must at least take note of the moral implications which he derives from it. As a matter of fact, the two are so closely interwoven in Nie- buhr's thought that his ethical doctrine sounds almost like a repeti- tion of the theology in a different key. There are some points of his doctrine about which it is impossible to say whether they per- tain to ethics or theology. Such, for example, is the "organic rela- tion" between the transcendent and the world, which was dis- cussed above in his theology, and will appear now in his ethics. Is it an objective truth that needs to be perceived, or a moral atti- tude that ought to be maintained? It is hard to say. The connection between Niebuhr's ethics and his theology can be illustrated by his concept of moral obligation and of the "sense of sin." Both of these notions are fundamental to his ethics, and both are conceived as part of the "religious tension of life" (p. 9) that results from viewing the world in the light of the transcendent. Moral obligation "is always an obligation to promote harmony and to overcome chaos" (p. 105). The given world is anarchic, and a moral act is one that tends to introduce some measure of order and unity into it. What drives man to moral acts, "bends the bow from which every arrow of moral action flies," is "the tension between what is and what ought to be" (p. 8). And that which "ought to be," the ideal at which the moral act aims and to which it responds, is nothing other than the transcendent "order of life in its more essential reality" (p. 8), the transcendent goal of life which we have already examined. Niebuhr gives no account as to how the transcendent ideal is constituted as that which "ought to be." This is a prime datum, an irreducible, fundamental element of his system: an ideal order of life which appears to man as that which ought to be. From the contrast between this transcendent ideal and the actual, his- torical reality, moral obligation is generated. Hence "the sense of obligation in morals from which Kant tried to derive the whole structure of religion is really derived from religion itself" (p. 9). The "ethical fruitfulness" of religions depends upon the tension which they are able to establish between the historical and the transcendent, and this in turn is measured by two considerations: "the degree to which the transcendent truly transcends every value</page><page sequence="24">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 195 and achievement of history, so that no relative value of historical achievement may become the basis of moral complacency; and the degree to which the transcendent remains in organic contact with the historical, so that no degree of tension may rob the histori- cal of its significance" (p. 9). Orthodox Christianity has suc- cumbed to the tendency to identify God with the symbols of God in history, whereas liberal Christianity has invested "the relative moral standards of a commercial age with ultimate sanctity by falsely casting the aura of the absolute and transcendent ethic of Jesus upon them" (ibid.). Only prophetic Christianity has suc- cessfully avoided these two extremes: S. . the God of mythical-prophetic conception . . . is both the ground46 of existence and the essence which transcends existence. In this mythical paradox lies the foundation for an ethic which enables men to give themselves to values actually embodied in persons and existence, but also transcending every actuality, thereby escaping both the glorification of human temporal and partial values characteristic of naturalism and also the morally enervating tendency of mysticism to regard "love of creatures" as disloyalty to God and to confine the love of God to a rational or mystic contemplation of the divine essence which transcends all finite existence. (p. 212) The sense of sin in Niebuhr's ethic is a negative counterpart of moral obligation. Like the latter, it "is the consequence of meas- uring life in its total dimension and discovering the self both re- lated to and separated from life in its essence" (p. 65). But whereas moral obligation impels man to act, the sense of sin reveals to man the shortcomings of his actions and thus saves him from "premature complacency" (p. 106). The sense of sin is not, however, a simple recognition that one has done wrong. It embraces different states of mind correspond- ing to three degrees of sin. When "higher possibilities, which the individual is not free to choose, reveal the imperfection of the action which he is forced to take," there results "a sense of religious guilt which feels a general responsibility for that for which the individual agent cannot be immediately responsible" (pp. 77, 78). From the feeling of guilt in this sense, "no action, not even the 46 Why the transcendent ideal must be conceived, not merely as the ful- fillment of existence, but also as its ground, has been explained in section II of the present article.</page><page sequence="25">196 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS best" is exempt in high religion (p. 82). Such a sense of sin is nothing other than an awareness of the contrast between the his- toric reality of one's own action and the transcendent ideal by which it must ultimately be measured. A greater degree of guilt occurs in those actions performed in situations in which "human reason is actually able to envisage moral possibilities, more inclusive loyalties, and more adequate harmonies of impulse and life ... than those which are actually chosen" (p. 77). In such actions there is "an element of perver- sity, a conscious choice of the lesser good," and this is the case with "practically every moral action" (p. 77). Finally, sin "in the more exact sense of the term" occurs when 0 . man makes pretensions of being absolute in his finiteness. He tries to translate his finite existence into a more permanent and absolute form of existence. This is the root of all imperialism in man, and explains why the restricted predatory impulses of the animal world are transmuted into the boundless imperial ambi- tions of human life. . . . (Man) tries, in short, to make himself God. (pp. 84,85) This supreme degree of sin consists not so much in the divergence of the self from the absolute or ideal, as in the identification of one's limited self with the absolute. Hence, there is presumably no "sense of sin" corresponding to it; rather it involves precisely a lack of any sense of sin. Niebuhr's basic ethical doctrine sums up in this: that man's moral life is generated by the sense of obligation, which impels him to strive for an ideal, and is safeguarded by the sense of sin, which keeps him from mistaking his limited and defective accom- plishments for the ideal. And as these two attitudes in turn spring from a sense of the transcendent, it is plain that in Niebuhr's con- ception, moral life is the fruit of a religious outlook, and ethics a statement of the practical implications of theology. This explains the persistent tendency of critics to appraise Niebuhr's thought from a theological point of view, despite his reiterated insistence that he does not consider himself a theologian, but a preacher or a professor of ethics. V Conclusion Niebuhr calls his religion "prophetic Christianity." It would</page><page sequence="26">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 197 seem more appropriate to call it mythical transcendentalism. It is a world view characterized by the postulation of an ideal order of reality which so transcends the historical world that it can suitably be expressed only in myths. It implies nothing that is either distinctively Christian or prophetic. The four great religious myths which Niebuhr recognizes - Creation, Fall, Judgment, and Redemption - are, it is true, taken from the religious tradition derived from Jesus and the Hebrew prophets; but this is an his- torical contingency that does not depend on the intrinsically super- natural character of these doctrines. Jesus and the prophets are not the emissaries of a personal God who freely uses them to make His voice heard in the human world; they do not even seem to perform any per se unique and irreplaceable function in the reli- gious history of mankind. What they accomplished is indeed re- markable, but is wholly of human inspiration and subject to criti- cism like all other historical achievements.47 The myths in which they voiced their doctrines would seem to be, at least in some equivalent form, the inevitable cornerstones of any great religion. The accomplishment of the Hebrew prophets lay in saving from extinction the old Hebraic culture-religion, based on the creator myth, by purifying and elevating it (pp. 26-30).48 Jesus recovered the true spirit of prophetic religion which had meanwhile been lost, and raised it to a still higher perfection. He gave the love ideal such purity, universality, and absolutism as to make it transcend the possibility of historic realization, but without destroying its organic contact with the historic order (pp. 31, 48). He also added a new myth - that of the Christ - to the four elaborated by the prophets.49 47 "Jesus no less than Paul, was not free of these historical illusions. He expected the coming of the Messianic kingdom in his lifetime; at least that seems to have been his expectation before the crisis in his ministry. Even when he faced the cross rather than triumph he merely postponed the ultimate triumph to a later future, though to a rather proximate one" (p. 57). It should be noted, that in his later writings, Niebuhr has occasionally made statements that seem to attribute a more than human value to Jesus Christ. Cf. note 50. 48 They saved it from the extinction with which the Babylonian captivity threatened it (p. 30); they purged it "of the parochial and puerile weaknesses of its childhood" - without, however, rationalizing it (p. 26); they elevated it "by their interpretation of the meaning of catastrophe" in terms of the Redemption myth, and they extended the Redemption so as to include "more than the fortunes of Israel" (p. 30). 49 "The Jesus of history actually created the Christ of faith in the life of the early Church" (p. 120). This Christ, as understood by orthodox Chris-</page><page sequence="27">198 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS In Niebuhr's later writings, the role of Christology seems to have augmented;50 but in the Interpretation, the distinctively Christian and prophetic elements do not seem to make any sig- nificant addition to what is already contained in his concept of mythical religion. In confirmation of this judgment, we may cite the following declaration: "Christian faith is a type of optimism which places its ultimate confidence in the love of God and not the love of man. .. ." "In the love of God" is immediately paraphrased as follows: "in the ultimate and transcendent unity of reality and not in ten- tative and superficial harmonies which human ingenuity may con- trive" (p. 120; italics ours). Niebuhr opposes this "prophetic" Christianity to the "liberal" Christianity against which he has crusaded ever since his conver- sion from it. Nevertheless, his mythical interpretation of the Chris- tian message is characteristic of the liberal approach; the elements of his creed that are most distinctively Christian have been trans- muted into a set of non-denominational beliefs that could as easily be expressed in non-Christian symbols. And Niebuhr accepts the fundamental presupposition of liberal theology - that Christianity is a human creation, even though perhaps superior to any other religion that has emerged in history. Finally, the intellectualist spirit in which Niebuhr conceives of a God who is neither wor- shipped nor loved, but simply postulated by a mind that cannot find meaning in the world without Him, is wholly congenial to the liberal mentality. It might seem as though Niebuhr's insistence on the divine transcendence distinguished his doctrine from the ordinary pattern of liberal Christianity; Niebuhr himself constantly brandishes this tianity, is a "true and mythical symbol of both the possibilities and limits of the human" (p. 15). The life of Jesus was not a redemptive act in the sense attributed to it by Catholic (or Lutheran) theology; rather, "His historic life is related to the transcendent Christ as a final and ultimate symbol of a relation which prophetic religion sees between all life and history and the transcendent" (p. 120). Niebuhr says nothing to indicate by what title the historic life of Jesus is "a final and ultimate symbol." On the other hand, he warns us that "the relation of the Christ of Christian faith to the Jesus of history cannot be discussed within the confines of this treatise in terms adequate enough to escape misunderstanding" (p. 120). 50 In 1956 he declared that "the Christological center of my thought has become more explicit and more important" (KB, p. 439). How true this is may be gauged by the avowal he makes (ibid.). "I have come gradually to realize that it is possible to look at the human</page><page sequence="28">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 199 point of his theology in the face of the liberals. However, a divinity that is nothing but an idealization of the historical world has a transcendence so qualified and anthropomorphic that few liberal theologies should have difficulty in embracing it. And it is quite in accord with the liberal spirit that this divinity should be pre- sented, not as a person who has freely intervened in human history, nor even as a Being whose existence is necessarily implied by objec- tive evidence, but simply as the satisfaction of a need experienced by the human soul - in this case, the need to find coherence and meaning in the world. The only major position of Niebuhr's that withstands the more characteristic movement of liberal theology is his insistence on the reality and prevalence of sin in human life. This is without a doubt an important theological issue; and if the essence of liberal- ism consists, as Niebuhr says, in "faith in man,"51 the stand one takes on this problem will be crucial in determining his relation to liberalism. However, liberal theology taken as a concrete, his- torical movement (and it is thus that Niebuhr always treats it) consists of much more than optimistic humanism; and in all other important questions, Niebuhr's theology conforms to the liberal pattern. In fact, it consists of little more than an amalgam of notions, nearly all of which are commonplace in one or another current of liberal thought.52 Even his conception of sin has under- situation without illusion and without despair only from the standpoint of the Christ-revelation. It has come to be more and more the ultimate truth. If it is reduced to something other than its Scriptural content, if, for instance, Jesus is revered as an exemplary man and example, all the confusions and sentimentalities of secular idealism are multiplied" (KB, p. 439). But Nie- buhr has never formulated his Christology, and it is hard to say whether the text just cited represents a change from the views he held in the Interpretation, or whether (as we are inclined to suspect), he would feel able to make both statements simultaneously. Professor Paul Lehmann, of Princeton Theological Seminary, declares that "Christology is the leit-motiv of Reinhold Niebuhr's theology." He adds that the most explicit and elaborate statement of Niebuhr's "Christological concern" (sic!) is to be found in Faith and history (New York, 1949), especially chapters IX-XI and XIII (KB, p. 253). 51Cf. supra, note 19. 52 This applies, we believe, not only to the notions we have discussed, but to countless others, for example, Niebuhr's views on mysticism, asceticism, sac- ramentalism, religious authority; likewise to his appraisals of St. Augustine and St. Thomas; and to much of his interpretation of Scripture. It must be remembered that Niebuhr does not profess to be a theologian (or historian); he relies largely on the experts in these fields, and it would appear that many of his 'experts' have a pronounced liberal outlook. His reply to Professor</page><page sequence="29">200 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS gone a characteristically liberal remolding, in that the "will of God" to which sin is opposed is nothing other than "life in its essence." This is not to say that his conversion from "liberal" to "pro- phetic" Christianity was unreal, or that his thought is wholly derivative. But his conversion and his originality are situated prin- cipally on another plane than that of theology - that of practical attitudes toward social and political questions; while the theological terms in which he expresses these attitudes are by and large those of liberal Christianity. The purpose for which Niebuhr elaborates his theological scheme is to put "a unity and coherence of meaning" into life and existence. He does not make it clear, however, to what extent he conceives this unity and coherence as objective properties of the real world which the religious mind merely discovers; many of his expressions suggest that he has in mind a subjective form, a sort of poetic vision, which men are impelled to impose on the world re-created by their minds, because of some inexplicable inner drive which makes the thought of an absurd world intolerable. Whatever be the case, it is by being referred to the transcen- dent that the world is seen to be meaningful and coherent. But is the transcendent itself coherent? It appears rather to be a con- fused blend of attributes that are mutually incompatible and singly unintelligible: for it is a source from which nothing actually comes, an end which nothing can attain, and an essence (in the sense of an idealization of historical reality), which is already the truest reality, although not realized in history nor existing apart from history. Niebuhr insists that the transcendent ideal must already be real, since otherwise it could not put man under an obligation; but he offers no objective argument for its reality: it is simply "an article of faith." Neither does he explain how, even granted that it be real, it engenders obligation. The transition from the Alan Richardson of Nottingham, England, on the question of Christ's Resur- rection, is typical: "My impression was that historical scholarship seemed to indicate that the story of the empty tomb was an afterthought and that the really attested historical fact was the experience of the risen Christ among his various disciples" (KB, p. 438). We have already noted (note 10) that when Niebuhr began to read St. Augustine's own works, he abandoned the "total depravity" interpretation of Augustine which Niebuhr had accepted presumably from some history of dogma.</page><page sequence="30">THEOLOGY OF REINHOLD NIEBUHR 201 is to the ought to be which is crucial to the entire body of Nie- buhr's thought, is nowhere justified.53 Niebuhr freely concedes that he has "never been very compe- tent in nice points of pure theology," adding with characteris- tic disdain that he has "not been sufficiently interested heretofore to acquire the competence." 54 But the shortcomings that have been pointed out - if such they be indeed - cannot be dismissed as "nice points" or minutiae; they affect the foundation and card- inal point of the entire system. When the elements of Niebuhr's theology are assembled to- gether, they do give the impression of some kind of coherence. Upon critical examination, however, this appears to derive from a blending of images rather than authentic intellectual consistency. Niebuhr, of course, frankly avows that a rationally consistent ex- planation of reality is impossible, and that he proposes to bring coherence and meaning into the world solely by myth. But it is the present writer's judgment that the myths which he employs serve mainly to dull the clash of incompatible concepts, while the brilliance of his style (which comes from vast historical acquaint- ances adroitly deployed by a resourceful imagination) veils radical deficiencies in the intellectual structure of his doctrine. These criticisms apply to Niebuhr's theology, not to his social and political views, which are a more important part of his thought. And even his theology has a certain value as an expression of his personal attitude towards life. He elaborated this theology as an attempt to formulate the theoretical bases underlying the moral convictions and attitudes he had developed in his personal en- counter with reality. Niebuhr is a man who has responded generously to the call of a noble ideal, but has experienced the resistance and corrupting influence with which the world resists its realization. All moral men undergo this experience; some react by abandoning the ideal in disillusionment, while others, who retain the ideal, renounce 53 If we may venture a conjecture, it is that Niebuhr has not adverted to the distinction between seeing a truth and "feeling" an obligation. He treats them as one, hence has no need of a bridge from one to the other. A similar criticism could be made of his concepts of the "meaningfulness" of life, of symbol, of "organic contact," and in general of every concept in his system that links theology and ethics. A study of these notions from the point of view of the confusion of the moral and ontological orders would cast signifi- cant light on the structure of Niebuhr's thought. 54 KB, p. 3.</page><page sequence="31">202 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS the sort of effective advocacy of it that would bring them conflict or trouble. Niebuhr's course has been neither to relinquish his ideals nor to abandon the struggle, but to persist in a campaign that has been both inspired and honest (very successful, too, we might add). It is the nobility of this position, together with the intelligent and persuasive statement of it, that explains the in- fluence Niebuhr has had on American social thought, and imparts the chief value to his work. In his effort to define the ultimate theological bases for this position, Niebuhr has been less successful. This is perhaps the profound reason for the tendency of contemporary American Protestantism to turn from Niebuhr to Tillich. The human mind demands an ontological basis for its moral convictions; and for the present, at least, the ontologically grounded theology of Paul Tillich seems to make a more plausible claim to satisfy this demand than does the morally inspired theology of Niebuhr. But the very fact that Niebuhr's ethics have made so profound an impact in spite of an insufficient intellectual foundation is itself indicative of their validity. Man's moral convictions are not derived from the phil- osophical theory by which he tries to give them a rational basis, but from tendencies inherent in the structure of his own being. He becomes conscious of moral obligations long before he is able to give theoretical reasons for them. If Niebuhr has been so much listened to in our time, it is because he has spoken a truth in the moral order which has been recognized by human hearts despite the inadequacy of his attempts to rationalize it.</page></plain_text>
