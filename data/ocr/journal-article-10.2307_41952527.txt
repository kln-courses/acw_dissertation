<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance Vol. 25 No. 2 (April 2000) 235-250 Large Companies and Insurance Purchases: Some Survey Evidence* by Brian G.M. Main** The paper discusses the corporate demand for insurance by offering a brief review of the theoretical work in the area and by presenting the results of a survey of large U.K. companies with regard to their insurance purchase decision. It is argued that the usual pooling-of-risks motivation for insurance purchases can usefully be superseded by a transaction-costs theory where insurance offers a low-cost alternative to expensive contingent contracting among the stakeholders of the firm. There remain substantial uncertainties over how wide or encompassing the notion of transaction cost is in this context, and there is some evidence that institutional and regulatory considerations also play a part in the company's insurance purchase decision. 1. Introduction The traditional approach to explaining the behaviour of large companies in purchasing insurance against general risks such as fire, storm damage, vehicle accidents, and third-party liabilities1 is to treat the company in a similar fashion to an individual. A utility function characterized by risk aversion is assumed, and insurers are able through risk pooling to offer the company risk reduction at a price which appeals to such risk-averse agents. While at the heart of this approach there remains something of a problem in defining exactly whose or what utility function is to be assumed, the fact that incorporated companies have legal personalities has the effect of suggesting that this might not be a major conceptual problem. But in the light of the work of Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965) and Mossin (1966) which extends the earlier efforts of Markowitz (1952) into a consolidated view of how to value the stocks and shares that are traded on securities markets, it becomes clear that this anthropomorphic view of the company as insurance purchaser cannot be sustained in the case of large widely-held companies. As will be explained below in more detail, investors with a widely diversified portfolio of shares have already "insured" the type of (specific) risks against which insurance policies offer protection. The explicit purchase of insurance cover by the individual companies merely incurs transaction costs while bringing no gain to the investors (the owners). This shortcoming in the traditional approach is highlighted by Main (1982a, 1982b) and by Mayers and Smith ( 1 982), among others. But while these authors investigate other possible motivations for insurance purchase by such large companies, motivations that do not rest on * This research was prompted by discussions at the 1 5th Annual European Law and Economics Conference in Utrecht, September 1998.

The results are informative and may point the way forward to a more encompassing theory of insurance purchases by large companies. Section 2 of the paper offers a brief review of the literature as it has developed in recent years. Section 3 discusses the sample design of the survey and presents a summary of the results obtained. Conclusions are drawn in section 4. 2. Theory When consideration is given as to what an insurer does by way of value added, the matter usually comes down to pooling a large number of risks. Such pooling has the effect that, to the extent these are independent risks, the law of large numbers ensures the average claim emanating from the average policy will be predictable with a very small, almost zero, variance. Any systematic correlation between risks that is local and capable of further diversification can be sold on under a reinsurance arrangement, and to the extent that this cannot happen then the risk is technically uninsurable, becoming a gamble or risk-assuming prospect, which is not what insurance is about. It is well known that by holding a large number of identical, or near identical, risks the insurance company faces very little uncertainty in terms of the average claims experience per policy. This is the basic pooling-of-risks explanation of insurer behaviour. The important point, in terms of large widely-held companies, is that each individual shareholder is free to have followed something akin to this strategy in choosing their portfolio of shares. Diversification is a key consideration in portfolio choice. Rather than thinking of the insurance company with its large number of policies written on broadly similar risks, we can think in terms of the diversified investor with a portfolio of shares in a range of companies each facing similar specific risks. The key insight of Markowitz ( 1 952), Sharpe ( 1 964), Lintner ( 1 965), and Mossin ( 1 966) is the realization that it is the part of the equity share's (or "stock") return which cannot be diversified, namely the systematic risk, which drives the relative pricing of one equity share versus another. In the context of a mean variance model of asset valuation,3 specific risk plays no part in capital asset pricing as it can be diversified away. But, of course, the quintessential type of specific risk, namely fires affecting plant or facility, vehicle accidents, or product liability is the very stuff of insurance.4 It follows that for any company to purchase insurance against such contingencies is not to the immediate advantage of its diversified shareholders. This is because such insurance purchases will involve certain transaction costs and loadings 2 The term " general risk" , which is taken here to represent the range of moderate non-life hazards confronting a company in its business (fire, storm damage, vehicle accidents, third-party liabilities, and so on), also represents, rather confusingly, what are known as specific risks in the finance literature - those risks which are not correlated across companies or the market in any systematic way. What is not a specific risk is termed a systematic risk. These systematic risks cannot be diversified away and form the key consideration of financial asset pricing in models such as the Capital Asset Pricing Model. 3 See Rubinstein, 1973 for a general discussion. 4 Main, 1983b, 1981 explains the importance, in this context, of distinguishing between specific and systematic risk. © 2000 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.</page><page sequence="3">LARGE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PURCHASES 237 which can only represent a diminution of profits to the shareholder with no offsetting gain. This assumes the existence of a well functioning second-hand market in the company's shares, in order that the investor can always be diversified, and this observation should, therefore, be restricted to widely-held companies. Any company advantage from insurance purchases must, therefore, rest on more subtle, less direct considerations than the mere selling or pooling of specific risk that is the feature of the standard view of insurance. In Skogh's terms (1989, p. 726), what we need is "a theory of insurance that is complementary to the pooling-of-risks theory". Some obvious examples of alternative theories and other considerations are considered by Main (1982a, 1982b) and by Mayers and Smith ( 1 982). Skogh ( 1 989) has brought these up to date by including transaction cost theory. The major alternatives are the following. Costs of financial distress Opportunity cost considerations suggest that any decision on whether or not to, say, rebuild a plant burned down in a fire will not depend on the existence of insurance cover. If the rebuilding project can offer a competitive return, then funds could be borrowed on the capital market; if not, then the proceeds of any insurance cover would be better lent or invested in the capital market than being committed to the project of rebuilding the plant. But if the destruction of the facility has placed the enterprise in a cash-flow crisis, whereby financial intermediaries are reluctant to lend, then this "externality" of financial distress would inhibit the rebuilding project even if commercially viable. In this case, the existence of insurance cover would make a difference. Bjuggren (1995) builds on a transaction cost approach of Williamson (1988) to develop this notion of financial distress and link it to the very real consideration of the conjunction of bounded rationality and opportunism resulting in difficulties in terms of incomplete contracting. The possibility of asset specificity produces further motivation, in this context, for the company purchase of insurance as a form of precontractual arrangement that reduces transaction costs. It is worth remembering, however, that for financial distress to be an empirical consideration we are talking more of catastrophe cover than the usual general risks cover. Informational asymmetries The possibility that the company is able to obtain a "good deal" from the insurance market because its risks are indeed greater than reflected in the policy price charged by the insurance cover, can only be a short-term disequilibrium phenomenon. Experience rating of premiums rapidly eliminates such situations.5 There is a role, however, for informational asymmetries if the company uses the purchase of insurance (and the consequent subjecting of the company to the insurance underwriter's risk-assessment scrutiny) as a way of signalling its true risk position to others who may have less access to such information. In a similar way, creditors may place a covenant on bond lending, requiring that the funded project or equipment be insured. Mayers and Smith (1987) revisit this issue and argue that a highly levered firm (with a large proportion of debt finance) is more likely to need to guarantee incentive compatibility (to ensure that equity holders and 5 As will be discussed in section 4, one of the respondents to the survey claims that at various stages of the underwriting cycle such considerations do nor apply and "bargain" rates are available. © 2000 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.</page><page sequence="4">238 MAIN owners behave in a way that is also in the interest of the bond holders). Such incentive compatibility (labelled "me-first" rules in Davidson et al., 1992, p. 62) can be engineered through insurance purchases. But most bonds are free from such covenants and most insurance purchases by companies are not well reported or audited, so the empirical importance of this mechanism is open to question. Human capital The relationship between a company and its employees is generally a long-term one. Co- investments in mutually advantageous specific human capital require a measure of trust on both sides. It is possible that, much as with bond or debenture holders above, the visible insuring of the plant and so on provides employees with an added measure of security which then encourages them to invest in specific human capital. In a sense this allows the employees' utility function to create a utility fiinction for the company. But the fact remains that, financial distress aside, insurance purchases result in no actual increase in security of the jobs involved, as the company's owners remain free to use any insurance-claim proceeds to invest elsewhere, or not to invest at all. Taxation While insurance premiums are generally tax deductible, so too are expenditures to repair accidental damage. Consequently, no immediate tax advantage of insurance purchase is apparent (or no more so than with the alternative of implicit self-insurance by absorbing the risk). But as Main (1983c) explains, there exists the possibility of insuring assets at replacement value and, under the tax exemption conditioned on "involuntary conversion", the possibility then arises of being able to repair any damage on an as-new basis using tax- exempt insurance proceeds. This leaves the company with the advantage of having depreciated the original asset during its existing years of service, thereby having enjoyed the benefits of this tax shield, and yet finding itself in the position of being able to restate the asset in the balance sheet and hence to depreciate the replacement asset as new. The occurrence of an insured accident consequently enhances the after-tax income of the company in a way that would not exist without the purchase of insurance. While this explanation remains valid it is not clear that it creates an empirically large incentive to purchase insurance. Insurer services Much as in the recent analysis of trade unions which has moved away from an emphasis on their monopoly power towards an examination of the services they provide to their members, this explanation of insurance purchases concentrates on the services that are packaged along with insurance cover. The importance placed on these services was recorded in an earlier survey6 by Main (1983a). Prominent among these are risk assessment and claims 6 "Many of the survey respondents went out of their way to point out the importance of the risk management, claims settlement, and specialized engineering services that come to them from the insurance company", Main, 1983a, p. 94. © 2000 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.</page><page sequence="5">LARGE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PURCHASES 239 handling. Ashby and Diacon (1996) provide survey evidence for the U.K. that documents the importance of risk management in large U.K. companies. In both of these areas of risk management and claims administration, insurers have the possibility of achieving economies of scale through specialization. Of course, risk assessment and advice on safety and maintenance can be purchased independently through engineering consultants, and claims handling can similarly be privatized, but it may be that economies of scale and scope allow insurers to hold on to a competitive advantage in these fields. Transaction cost theory Skogh (1989, 1991, 1998) argues that an important function of company purchases of insurance is to introduce the external monitoring role of the insurance underwriter, hence inhibiting opportunistic behaviour on the part of the company and, thereby, enhancing the degree of co-operation among stakeholders and consequently reducing transaction costs. This is a more comprehensive argument than that raised under human capital considerations above . It also anchors the purchase of insurance by companies in the field of transaction cost economics. The advantage in transferring casualty-type risks to an insurer who specializes in pricing such low probability risks and in dealing with their outcomes (risk management, claims handling, etc.) is that such a transfer avoids the high transaction costs of negotiating contingent contracts with the various stakeholders in the organization. Insurance companies possess experience and expertise in handling what are to other agents relatively low probability events. Their expertise is manifested both in the pricing of these risks (in terms of deciding price per policy and designing the associated deductibles and risk prevention programmes) and in handling the outcomes that do arise (in terms of loss adjustment, claims handling, etc.). Contract design and enforcement falls to the party with most expertise (the insurer), and transaction costs are thereby minimized. The attraction of engaging such specialists in contracting applies whether the company is a small private firm with a risk- averse owner manager or a large widely held public corporation. The attraction does not rest on pooling-of-risks as such. Other considerations In an interesting game-theoretic analysis of two firms in an oligopolistic market-sharing situation, Ashby and Diacon ( 1 998) argue that company purchases of insurance provide a way by which companies can co-ordinate their efforts to reduce output fluctuations and hence reduce the chance of destabilizing co-operation in the profit-maximizing collusive arrange- ment to share the market. Also deploying strategic considerations, but this time in the context of legal cost insurance, Kirstein ( 1 998) demonstrates that the presence of insurance may enhance a litigant's bargaining strength in their pre-trial negotiation rather than serving to shift risk. The next section of the paper examines the extent to which these various non-risk- pooling views of the insurance purchases are supported by evidence from a survey of large U.K. companies. 3. The survey and its results Empirical work in the area of company purchases of insurance has been relatively sparse. There are three recognizable forms. The most direct is the case study. An excellent example of © 2000 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.</page><page sequence="6">240 MAIN this mode of investigation is available in Doherty and Smith (1993), where the authors look in depth at the decision of British Petroleum to insure against most small losses while absorbing (or self-insuring) all large risks. This strategy is certainly difficult to explain using the pooling-of-risks approach to insurance, but fits quite readily into Skogh's (1989) transaction cost theory approach. In a second type of approach, illustrated in both Davidson et al. (1992) and Mayers and Smith (1990), investigators utilize aggregate statistical data, from the reports of the A M Best Company. These studies are generally limited by lack of detailed information on the variables of interest, e.g. the tax status of individual firms in the study of reinsurance by Mayers and Smith (1990) and firm-specific data in Davidson et al. (1992). A third and more direct approach is that of the survey questionnaire. Hogue and Olson (1976) use personal interviews7 in their pioneering effort. Main (1983a) relied on a postal questionnaire of the Fortune 500 and achieved a response rate of 23.3 per cent. In their postal survey of risk and finance managers at 350 U.K. companies in 1 993, Ashby and Diacon ( 1 996) achieved a response rate of 27 per cent on the first attempt and a cumulative 36 per cent after a follow up some two months later. The survey results presented here are from a postal questionnaire8 sent out to some 373 companies chosen from the top 500 companies in the 1998 publication of the Times 1000. No follow-up or reminder questionnaires were dispatched, but a response rate of some 32 per cent is achieved on the first sweep.9 This relatively high response rate possibly reflects an interest in this topic or may be due to the promise of the return of a description of the survey results to all those who participated. From the analysis of responses, it appears that insurance management in large companies is a fairly specialized business with an average of 2.4 people in each company so involved on a full-time basis, and with 1 9 per cent of companies having five or more people engaged on a full-time basis. The reporting level of these insurance specialists is at a reasonably senior level (with 57 per cent reporting to main board level). Unsurprisingly, most companies regularly review their risk exposures in terms of buildings, machinery and equipment, inventory, and fixtures. Only in the case of motor vehicles does the routine review of risk exposure deviate from the near universal. This is probably due to the use of leased vehicles and the standard insurance requirements imposed by law in this field. It is evident that a significant proportion of perceived risk exposure is self-insured (retained). Some 95 per cent of the responding companies take an explicit policy decision to absorb certain potential losses, with 42 per cent of respondents retaining over 20 per cent of insurable risks, and 20 per cent of respondents retaining over 50 per cent of insurable risks. Furthermore, 60 per cent of companies see themselves as moving towards more self- insurance. That said, the average level of insurance premiums paid by the responding firms is significant with an average across the sample of £7.6 million. In terms of the key considerations of this paper, the various non-risk-pooling factors that might be thought to be influencing the insurance decision are presented in Table 1 . This is 7 The interviews lasted some one hour and 22 minutes on average and 1 143 enterprises were interviewed. 8 A copy of the questionnaire is can be found on the World Wide Web at http://www.ed.ac.uk/~ejaal7/. From the top 500 companies listed in the Times 1000 , all investment trusts and property companies are eliminated, leaving a sample frame of 373 companies from which 1 19 responses are obtained. Anonymity is guaranteed to all respondents. 9 The responding firms over-represent the larger companies from the sampling frame, with 44 per cent in the top quartile, 28 per cent in the second quartile, 24 per cent in the third quartile and 21 per cent in the fourth quartile responding. This gives an overall response rate of 32 per cent.

In Table 1, the value 1 is assigned to indicate "not at all important", the © 2000 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.</page><page sequence="8">242 main value 2 indicates "only somewhat important", and the value 3 "very important".10 Table 1 ranks the average scores from most to least important on the basis of the average score. The top five reasons can all be taken as relating to financial distress or profit-maximizing considerations, in some way or other. Rate of return, avoidance of catastrophic losses, cash flow/earnings smoothing, and economic return on premiums all figure prominently. It is only with the sixth and lower ranked reasons that considerations of signalling, bond-holder or statutory requirements enter. Even these reasons are closely followed by cost of capital and tax-related considerations. Insurance as a confidence-building measure among the workforce ranks 12th in this list, and insurer services such as the joint provision of loss prevention programmes and claims handling are ranked lowest. From a slightly different perspective, Table 2 reports on the responses to a question which probed as to the importance of various considerations relating to the choice of insurer. Once again, these are ranked by the average score of importance on a scale of one to three. The flexibility of the insurer and the impact of claims experience on premiums assume two of the top three positions. But claims handling and the provision of information also are ranked high, these last two being transaction cost-based reasons. Among the remaining reasons there is little difference in weightings. Table 3 attempts to arrange these various dimensions in groupings that relate to those themes raised above, namely costs of financial distress, informational asymmetries, taxation, human capital, insurer services, transaction cost theory, and other considerations. This grouping is somewhat speculative, and it is possible to argue with the composition of the groupings. 1 1 In addition, for some themes there are multiple measures available (for example, there are some five questions that might be argued to tap a concern with transaction costs) whereas there are relatively few for others (there being, for example, only one question that relates to human resources and providing security of employment). What is done in Table 3 is to sum over the available scores in an unweighted manner to provide an average score for the group, and then to present the results ranked by the average score for the group and, within groups, by the score on individual dimensions. By this procedure, there are three grouping that stand out: transaction cost theory (score 2.29), costs of financial distress (score 2.27) and other considerations (score 2. 1 8). Thereafter come insurer services (score 2.01) and informational asymmetries (score 1 .90), with a larger gap before taxation (score 1.55) and human capital considerations (score 1.39). While these results lend some support to the idea that non-risk-pooling motives may indeed be driving the demand for company purchases of insurance, there remains substantial scope for more precise analysis. It seems difficult to say much more on the basis of these results other than that taxation and human capital considerations seem relatively unimportant. In an effort to add a little more precision to the analysis, two additional variables captured by the survey are analysed by multiple regression. The first variable utilizes an indication given by respondents as to the level of insurance purchases made by their companies. In the original question, this is described in a categorical manner, and to facilitate regression the mid-points of these categories are used to estimate the approximate expenditure (in £ 10 In the questionnaire a fourth category was offered to respondents if they were not sure how to respond. These values are treated as missing values here and ignored. 1 1 However, the raw data are available in Tables 1 and 2, and readers are free to experiment with alternative groupings. © 2000 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.</page><page sequence="9">LARGE COMPANIES AND INSURANCE PURCHASES 243 Table 2: Ranking of importance of considerations concerning choice of insurance company Average score (1 = very important; 3 = not at all important) (Standard Number of Rank Reason deviation in responses brackets) 1 .

Because of the susceptibility to outliers, a robust regression technique is deployed.13 Regression results using the logarithm of insurance purchase as the dependant variable are reported in the left-hand column of Table 4. As is common in the specification of expenditure and wage equations, the logarithmic transformation is used to allow for a wide range in the level of insurance purchased. A second dependent variable that is also susceptible to regression analysis can be created from the responses to a question asked of respondents regarding the percentage of their company's perceived insurable risk which is, in fact, self insured.14 Using the mid-points of these categorical responses to provide a measure,/?, of the percentage of risk self-insured, it is possible to perform a logit regression.15 The results obtained are displayed in the second column of Table 4. As expected, size matters here. The logarithm of company turnover is positively related to the level of expenditure on insurance purchases (coefficient 0.843) and also positively related to the proportion of risk that is self-insured (coefficient 0.324). This is not 13 Robust regression is conducted in STATA which uses an initial screening method based on Cook's Distance to eliminate gross outliers prior to calculating starting values and then performs Huber iterations whereby small residual cases are assigned a weight of unity and large residual cases get smaller weights. See Volume 3 of the STATA manuals (4th edn), p. 136.

In terms of the other explanatory variables, the willingness of the insurer to tailor coverage is associated with lower expenditure on insurance (-0.675) and a higher proportion of self-insurance (1.214). The perceived provision of loss experience information is positively associated with the proportion of risk self-insured (0.796) as is, unsurprisingly, the assistance in developing a self-insurance programme (0.834). This last variable also significantly reduces the absolute amount of insurance bought. Taken as a group, the descriptors that were associated above with transaction cost motivations for insurance purchase seem to lead more to non-purchase of insurance, suggesting that while these motives may be important, they are important to companies who are already limiting their purchases of insurance. In terms of avoiding financial distress, it is surprising that the catastrophic loss concern does not appear to be statistically or empirically important. The desire to protect cash flow and hence avoid financial distress is positively related to insurance purchases (0.460), but concern over a stable earnings function has a negative impact on the level of insurance purchase which seems perverse. None of these variables significantly influences the self-insurance propor- tion. Turning to other considerations, a sensitivity of insurance premiums to claims experience and a sensitivity to the opportunity cost of cash flow tied up in self-insurance © 2000 The International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics.</page><page sequence="14">248 MAIN reserves are, as might be expected, both associated with a higher proportion of self-insurance (coefficients of 0.752 and 0.762 respectively). Most surprisingly, none of the insurer services variables is statistically significant in either column of Table 4. Informational asymmetries in the form of providing a signal to the business community (0.526) and being required by bond-holders (0.493) are associated with higher insurance purchases. Importance placed on the profitability or rating of the insurance carrier seems to be associated with less insurance purchased. This may reflect a substitution of quality of cover for quantity, or a greater importance placed on the core cover purchased. Achieving lower cost of capital through insurance purchase is associated with companies with a higher proportion of self-insurance (0.720). For taxation, there is no statistically significant influence on the level of insurance, but such concerns reduce the proportion self-insured (with coefficients of -0.967 and -0.998). Finally, providing assurance to workforce reduces the proportion of self insured (-1.357). 4. Conclusion With an average £7 million in insurance purchases per company in the survey data considered above, the demand for insurance from companies is clearly significant. But in this empirically important area of insurance purchases by large widely-held companies, the motivations underlying such purchases seem to lie not in the traditional risk-pooling considerations but in a range of other influences. It is certainly possible to distinguish earlier non-risk-pooling explanations such as costs of financial distress, informational asymmetries, taxation, human capital, and insurer services. But a more encompassing concept is that of transaction cost economics where the company's purchase of insurance is intended to introduce the external monitoring role of the insurance underwriter, hence inhibiting opportunistic behaviour on the part of the company and so enhancing the degree of co-operation among stakeholders and reducing transaction costs. When asked directly (as reported in Table 1) about the importance of various factors in deciding how much insurance to purchase, surveyed companies rank considerations of catastrophic loss and financial distress ahead of notions of signalling their probity to the financial community. Requirements by bondholders, tax considerations, and assurances to employees are ranked even lower. Similarly, when considering what influences choice among insurers (as in Table 2), the flexibility and service aspects (claims handling, provision of loss experience information, premium adjustment) seem to dominate general familiarity or assistance with in-house loss prevention or self-insurance programmes. Grouping these various factors presents some difficulty as there is clear scope for overlap, but the suggestion from an attempt made in Table 3 is that there are several prominent strands, not least of which is transaction costs, but that assurance to the workforce and tax considerations do not seem to be among the more important. Taking a step further in Table 4 by deploying multivariate analysis serves to underscore the complexity of the situation. In general, factors that are associated with an increase in the propensity to purchase insurance are also linked to a decreased proportion of risks that are self-insured. Some of these relationships are obvious. Thus, those companies that place importance on insurance companies assisting them in developing and servicing their own self-insurance programmes tend to buy less insurance and self-insure more.

There are also certain institutional aspects that are neglected here. Thus, in open-ended comments in the questionnaire returns, several survey respondents emphasize the importance of statutory requirements in dictating insurance purchase (e.g. public liability, employee liability, and so on). Others indicate that they are often contractually obliged to purchase insurance, either by banks (a motive similar to the bondholders variable used above) or by business partners. Several respondents feel that insurance cover represents an aspect of good corporate governance and protects shareholder value (a view at odds with the material in section 2 above). Another observation is that by being sensitive to the underwriting cycle it is possible to acquire insurance cover at bargain rates. It is the conclusion of this paper that there are a wide range of motives other than risk- pooling for companies to purchase insurance. Apart from the more economistic, such as minimizing taxes, most of these reasons can be grouped under transaction cost considera- tions. From the analysis presented above, it seems likely that the more useful notion of transaction costs here is an encompassing one rather than the narrower range offered in Table 3, which attempts to separate transaction costs from other alternative motives. The results, particularly in Table 4, suggest that the story of company insurance purchases is a complex one, with a wide range of interactions among a range of influences, many of which can be viewed as stemming from transaction cost considerations.
