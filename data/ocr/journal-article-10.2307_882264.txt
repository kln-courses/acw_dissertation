<plain_text><page sequence="1">A source for the inverted imagery in Georg Baselitz's painting BY RICHARD CALVOCORESSI THE upside-down compositions of Georg Baselitz (b. 1938) have baffled many people since their first appearance in 1969. Seen in the context of his earlier work, however, and understood metaphorically rather than literally or as a gimmick to attract attention, I believe their meaning is not so difficult to grasp. The standard view of Baselitz - one that he has himself helped to promote - is that content is of little significance in his art; he is concerned to create an abstract, autonomous painting, though one in which the object is still recognisable.' Like Cezanne's apples or Monet's haystacks, Baselitz's trees, eagles and cows thus become a pretext for formal and stylistic explorations. He paints in series. The Strassenbild cycle of 1979-80, in which the motif of the shouting or gesticulating figure at a window is slightly varied from picture to picture,2 is a conspicuous exam- ple which in a curious way recalls both Monet and his late- modernist successors in minimal art. Repetition is one of several devices employed by Baselitz to undermine the individuality of his subject and purge it of any emotional connotation. In each of the eleven P. D. Fuss paintings of 1963 a putrefying foot, painted in colours that demonstrate the artist's admiration for Griinewald's rendering of diseased skin in the Isenheim altar- piece, is shown from a different angle, as if illustrating a medical textbook; in certain cases the foot appears as an isolated, anon- ymous stump, mutilated above the ankle.3 Baselitz has consistently refuted any connection between his work and expressionism, and yet his imagery, if not exactly conveying extreme emotional or psychological states, at least evokes their portrayal in earlier art. Van Gogh, Munch and Nolde have all on occasion been 'quoted', while the Strassenbild paintings more generally echo the erotic urban encounters depicted by Kirchner and other artists of Die Briicke. Some of the heads in Baselitz's recent figure paintings, such as Franz im Bett and Adler im Bett, both of 1982, bear a striking resemblance to the grotesque beak masks worn by doctors in the seventeenth century as a protection against the plague.4 Baselitz has also identified with a range of outcasts or outsiders, such as the late nineteenth-century Swedes C. F. Hill and Ernst Josephson, as well as other lesser known schizophrenic artists.5 There is noth- ing remarkable in this interest: over sixty years have passed since the publication of Hans Prinzhorn's influential book on the art of the insane,6 and in our own day the work of Giinter Brus, Arnulf Rainer and others testifies to the power which this alter- native tradition of l'art brut continues to exert over the artist's imagination. But in Baselitz's case it does suggest that, contrary to received opinion, content is important. By looking at his early work, which is rich in allusions of a particular kind, we may conclude that pain and suffering can be 1 Among statements made by the artist at various times, the following may be regarded as typical: 'I have always seen my paintings as independent from meanings with regard to contents - and also independent from associations that could result from them. If one pursues the logical conclusion of that thought, then it follows that if one needs a tree, a person or a cow in the picture, but without meaning, without contents, then one simply takes it and turns it upside down. Because that really separates the subject from its associations, that simply has to be believed; it defies an interpretation of the contents. If it stands on its head, it is delivered of all ballast, it is delivered from tradition'. (H.

For Hill and Josephson, see Vor der Zeit: Carl Fredrik Hill und Ernst Josephson, Zwei Kiinstler des spdten 19. Jahrhunderts, exhibition catalogue, Kunstverein in Hamburg [1984]. Two drawings by Hill are remarkably prophetic of Baselitz's preoccupations: one depicting a single fir tree (No.4) and another a man holding a fish in each hand (No.96). Both tree and figure are placed centrally on the paper and occupy its entire height, emphasising the emblematic quality of the image. For the appearance of a stylised fir tree in Baselitz's work, see the catalogue of his last exhibition at Waddington Galleries [October-November 1984], especially the drawing repr. p.32; and Richard Shone's review in these pages, [January 1985], p.59. The charcoal drawing of the fisherman, whose flybuttons are shown undone, has strong aggressive and sexual connotations, as in some of Baselitz's paintings of 'heroes' with their exposed genitals. The interpenetration of verbal and visual imagery is a characteristic of schizophrenic art shared by Hill and later parodied by Baselitz in his two Pandemonium manifestos of 1961 and 1962, the second of which is also a homage to Artaud. 6 Bildnerei der Geisteskranken, Berlin [1922]. 894</page><page sequence="2">83.

Consider Baselitz's use of the tree as an image, which, in German art from Altdorfer to Joseph Beuys, has acquired semi-mystical overtones.7 Through its association with the Crucifixion, the tree becomes a terrible symbol of human cruelty. The analogy between tree, cross and human body is frequently made in Baselitz's paintings and drawings of the sixties. Tree trunks are shown scorched, their stunted or broken branches dripping blood. This anthropomorphism is reinforced by the addition of male human attributes such as a hunting bag slung around the trunk (Fig.83)9 or forms sug- gestive of organs, both digestive and reproductive, hanging from branches or draped over the roots.10 The lone shepherd or hunter leaning against a tree trunk is a common subject in German nineteenth-century painting. In 1855, for example, Ferdinand von Rayski, a realist painter much admired by Base- litz, painted an imposing portrait of Alexander Graf von Einsiedel (Neug Pinakothek, Munich) which shows the Saxon count in hunting clothes, shotgun under one arm, resting against a magnificently solid tree. In Vorwiirts Wind 1966, one of Baselitz's khaki-clad partisans - today's mock-heroic answer to the tradi- tional shepherd or hunter - his arms and legs outstretched to the extremities of the canvas, stands directly in front of a blackened tree. It is one of the most frontal and symmetrical of all Baselitz's compositions and its emblematic implications are obvious."11 Crucifixion imagery also occurs in the early paintings ofA. R. Penck, Baselitz's oldest friend; and of course it runs like a leit- motif through the more self-dramatised work of Arnulf Rainer (Fig.86). As distinct from the Viennese 'actionists', however, Baselitz is not concerned to simulate ritual violence or sacrifice for its supposed cathartic effect: he is a painter, not an action painter or a performer. But Christian iconography has provided him with a potent source for his topsyturvy vision of the world. There are numerous representations in western art of the mar- tyrdom of St Peter, who is traditionally believed to have been crucified upside down at his own request in the Roman arena. One particularly realistic example seems to have stimulated Baselitz's imagination. This is by Masaccio, part of a predella in the Gemaldegalerie in West Berlin, where Baselitz lived for several years after leaving the German Democratic Republic (Fig.87). The painting depicts the moment when the saint's hands are nailed to the crossbeam; his feet, placed fairly wide apart, have already been pinned to a much shorter beam at the top (or bottom) of the wooden cross. Baselitz made two draw- ings based on this picture in 1969,12 the year he began to paint everything upside down. He shows the inverted figure propped up against a tree trunk instead of a cross, but there are unmistakable marks in one of the drawings (Fig.85) of a rectan- gular crossbeam supporting his arms and another to which his knees are nailed. Although Baselitz tilts the body forty-five degrees away from the spectator, thus softening the brutal sym- metry of Masaccio's image, he retains such details as the saint's halo, bearded face and loincloth. Francis Bacon once compared Cimabue's great Crucifixion, which he had inverted in his mind (and which is illustrated upside-down in the book of interviews with David Sylvester) to 'a worm crawling down the cross'.13 This bizarre image inspired the right-hand panel of Bacon's Crucifixion triptych of 1962, now in the Guggenheim. On one level Bacon's paintings are private and profoundly ambiguous statements but, on another, his achievement has been to take archetypal subjects from art his- tory and mythology and remake them in language which reflects our atrocity-conscious but Godless age. Is it therefore surprising that Baselitz, whose childhood in Saxony must have been interrupted by accounts or actual scenes of war, occupation and expulsion, should have turned to the Crucifixion as (in Bacon's words) an 'armature on which you can hang all types of feeling and sensation'?'4 The peculiar significance of the crucifixion of St Peter as a motif for Baselitz lay presumably in its fortuitous evocation of that tradition of popular imagery, closely related to European Fool literature, in which moral and social values are overturned - the Mundus inversus or topsyturvy world.15 Among more literal examples of this type of imagery are variations on the following themes: an ox (sometimes a pig) wearing an apron takes a hatchet to a man suspended upside-down by his toes; trees stand on the tips of their branches; and a tree trunk with human face and limbs saws a woodcutter in half.16 The latter could almost be a/description of one of Baselitz's own 'fracture' paintings of 1967-69, where the dismembered pieces of foresters and their dogs are sent spinning round the picture plane, and the presence of an axe serves as an ironic reminder of the artistic violence that has taken place.17 From such visions of disharmony it was a logical step to painting the subject on its head. And indeed, in one of Baselitz's first upside-down pictures, Der Wald aufdem Kopf 1969 (Fig.84), trees really do 'stand on the tips of their branches'. Yet despite this subversion of natural order, the image conveys little of the sense of absurdity that it undoubtedly would if painted by, for example, Magritte. This is in large measure due to Baselitz's more painterly technique, which forces us to see the work as a painted surface before anything else. But inverted trees are one thing, inverted humans another. When we contemplate the primitive body language of Baselitz's figures, we would do well to recall the artist's own words: 'When you have a sign, a cross or whatever, it has a source, a real source - not abstract - in a gesture, in human posture'. 7'Einen Baum niederschlagen konnte dem Morde an einem Menschen gleich erachtet wer- den': not a spokesman for die Griinen, but HERBERT SCHRADE in Baum und Wald in Bildern deutscher Maler, published, significantly, in 1937 in Munich, p.3. 8 See for example, pl.41, 43, 48 and 50 in catalogue of Georg Baselitz Zeichnungen 1958-1983, Kunstmuseum Basel [1984]. 9 Untitled 1966, oil on canvas, 135 by 79 cm (Galerie Michael Werner, Cologne). 10 E.g.

As I have pointed out elsewhere, the convergence of erotic and religious imagery, often in morbid, sado-masochistic Crucifixion fantasies, is another aspect of schizo- phrenic art which is echoed in Baselitz's work. (Freud, it will be remembered, compared the behaviour of neurotics to that of the devout.)

In a lecture at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in September 1983, Sarah Wilson cited the general theme of the Martyrdom of St Peter as one of several possible precedents for Baselitz's prac- tice of inversion, although she was unaware at the time of the painting by Masaccio or of Baselitz's studies after it. 13 Interviews with Francis Bacon 1962-1979, London [1980], p.14. 14 Ibid., p.44. 15 The first to connect Baselitz with the Mundus inversus idea was D.

Anamorphic imagery, which Baselitz used in his work of the late 'fifties and early 'sixties, is closely related to this tradition. "7 See R.

The majority of refugees from Germany's eastern territories in Prussia, Silesia and Pomerania following the defeat of Hitler were countrymen - farmers, foresters, agricultural workers - and it may have been these whom Baselitz had in mind when painting his Waldarbeiter. 18 'Entretien avec Jean-Louis Froment et Jean-Marc Poinsot', cited at note 3 above, p.18.
