<plain_text><page sequence="1">Music as Drama Fred Everett Maus Introduction Recent professional music theory and analysis have tended to avoid certain large questions. Theorists have written little, explicitly at any rate, about the value of music, or the nature of musical experience. Stanley Cavell has noted that, whatever the cause, the absence of humane music criticism ... seems particularly striking against the fact that music has, among the arts, the most, perhaps the only, systematic and precise vocabulary for the description and analysis of its objects. Somehow that possession must itself be a liability; as though one undertook to criticize a poem or novel armed with complete control of medieval rhetoric but ignorant of the modes of criticism developed in the past two centuries.1 Joseph Kerman has also expressed regret at the limitations of professional theory and analysis. Kerman suggests that the appeal of systematic analysis was that it provided for a positivistic approach to art, for a criticism that could draw on precisely defined, seemingly objective operations and shun subjective criteria.2 The following have given me valuable advice and encouragement in re- sponse to earlier versions of this paper, and I am very grateful to them: Milton Babbitt, Edward T. Cone, Joseph Dubiel, Patrick Gardiner, Eric Graebner, Marjorie Hess, Katharine Maus, Alan Montefiore, James K. Randall, Eric Wefald, Peter Westergaard, and Richard Wollheim. 1Stanley Cavell, Must We Mean What We Say? (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), 186. 2Joseph Kerman, Contemplating Music (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985), 73. Cavell and Kerman agree that the precision, definiteness, and clarity of theory and analysis have worked to discourage the study of more obscure and demanding aspects of music. It would be hard to relinquish the precision and detail that musical analysis can offer; the problem is to integrate theory and analy- sis somehow into a more comprehensive understanding of mu- sic. At times theorists seem simply oblivious to such issues. Al- len Forte, in a paper on Schenker that is probably the best intro- duction to Schenker's late work, concludes with a list of un- solved problems in music theory, suggesting that Schenker's work might contribute to solutions. He mentions, for instance, the lack of a theory of rhythm in tonal music, and the lack of helpful analytical techniques for music outside the standard eighteenth- and nineteenth-century repertoire. Forte does not ask whether Schenker's work can lead to a better understanding of the importance of music, or to a convincing account of musi- cal experience. In this Forte is more reticent than Schenker him- self, whose writings are full of evaluations and speculations that go far beyond Forte's range of concerns. But Forte is silent about Schenker's broader claims, except for a footnote in which he tersely dismisses "Schenker's frequent indulgence in lengthy ontological justification of his concepts."3 Forte's paper as- sumes that one aspect of music, its "structure," can be distin- guished from other aspects and studied separately. Other forms of inquiry might concern themselves with other aspects of mu- sic, but music theory and musical analysis, as the study of "structure," can progress independently of those other fields. Some theorists are more explicit than Forte in acknowledg- ing areas of aesthetic inquiry that they have set aside. Fred Ler- dahl and Ray Jackendoff write that 3Allen Forte, "Schenker's Conception of Musical Structure," in Maury Yeston, ed., Readings in Schenker Analysis and Other Approaches (New Ha- ven: Yale University Press, 1977). Kerman has commented on Forte's paper to show the self-imposed restrictions of professional theory and analysis.</page><page sequence="2">Music as Drama 57 an artistic concern that we do not address here is the problem of musi- cal affect-the interplay between music and emotional responses . . like most contemporary theorists, we have shied away from affect, for it is hard to say anything systematic beyond crude statements such as observing that loud and fast music tends to be exciting. To approach any of the subtleties of musical affect, we assume, requires a better understanding of musical structure.4 David Epstein writes that "the matter of 'expression' in music is beyond the confines of these studies ... the question of what music 'says' is vast and complex and deserves separate study." Like Lerdahl and Jackendoff, Epstein suggests that an under- standing of "expression" presupposes an understanding of "structure": "in attacking this problem it is first of all essential clearly to perceive, to recognize, and to comprehend what it is we hear, free of external or misconstrued meanings."5 These two sources imply the existence of a dichotomy between, on one hand, issues of musical "structure," and on the other hand, is- sues of "affect" or "expression." In referring to "affect," Ler- dahl and Jackendoff link that part of the dichotomy to emotion. Epstein, more cautiously, relies on two different formulations, referring to" 'expression' "and to "what a piece 'says,' "using scare-quotes and commenting that the terms are imprecise. But evidently Epstein sees a dichotomy between, on one hand, "structure," and on the other hand, an aspect of music analo- gous to the meaning of human language or gesture. Whether or not they acknowledge the existence of larger aesthetic issues, theorists generally defend the autonomy of their own studies. Even Kerman, while castigating analysts for 4Fred Lerdahl and Ray Jackendoff, A Generative Theory of Tonal Music (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1983), 8. In a footnote they add a further comment: "The affective content of music, we believe, lies in its exploitation of the tonal system to build dramatic structure." This suggestion is in accord with my argu- ment in this paper, though Lerdahl and Jackendoff would probably find my presentation unacceptably informal. 5David Epstein, Beyond Orpheus (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1979), 11. their narrowness, seems to leave room for such an independent area of inquiry: Their dogged concentration on internal relations within the single work of art is ultimately subversive as far as any reasonably complete view of music is concerned. Music's autonomous structure is only one of many elements that contribute to its import. Along with preoccu- pation with structure goes the neglect of other vital matters-not only the whole historical complex ... but also everything else that makes music affective, moving, emotional, expressive.6 According to Kerman, analysis has usurped the place in musical institutions and education that should be occupied by a more ambitious music criticism. But Kerman writes of the "autono- mous structure" of music as though such a component can be isolated unproblematically: it is one, though only one, of mu- sic's "elements." Criticism, then, would supplement descrip- tions of "structure" with considerations of historical context and with-again-an area of concerns linked somehow to hu- man emotion. In trying to understand what music theory can contribute to a more general understanding of music, it would be natural to be- gin with this well-entrenched dichotomy between "structure" and "affect" or "expression." Many musicians and writers on music believe that some such dichotomy exists. If they are right, then an understanding of the distinction between these different aspects of music, and-once they are clearly distinguished-an understanding of the relation between them, would be a crucial step in integrating the insights of music theory into a larger pic- ture. In reflecting on this dichotomy, theorists can now turn to work by the philosopher Peter Kivy, who has recently distin- guished between "technical" and "emotive" descriptions of music, arguing for the musical importance of emotive qualities. 6Kerman, Contemplating Music, 73.</page><page sequence="3">58 Music Theory Spectrum Kivy's essay The Corded Shell begins by noting a "paradox of musical description": Either description of music can be respectable, "scientific" analysis, at the familiar cost of losing all humanistic connotations; or it lapses into its familiar emotive stance at the cost of becoming, according to the musically learned, meaningless subjective maundering.7 Kivy distinguishes two kinds of musical description, and he as- sociates each kind with a different readership: trained musicians prefer technical description, while "musically untrained" music-lovers are likely to find emotive description attractive. So in evaluating emotive description, Kivy not only addresses a general aesthetic issue, he also addresses a practical problem about criticism. Professional musicians may enjoy "the healthy atmosphere of amphibrachs and enhanced dominant relation- ships," but such technical description leaves a large and worthy musical community out in the cold. Music, after all, is not just for musicians and musical scholars, any more than painting is just for art historians, or poetry for poets. It seems both surprising and intolerable that while one can read with profit the great critics of the visual and literary arts without being a professor of En- glish or the history of art, the musically untrained but humanistically educated seem to face a choice between descriptions of music too technical for them to understand, or else decried as nonsense by the authorities their education has taught them to respect.8 How should one address this issue? According to Kivy, What needs doing, rather than to take cheap shots at technical lan- guage, is to make emotive description once again respectable in the 7Peter Kivy, The Corded Shell: Reflections on Musical Expression (Prince- ton: Princeton University Press, 1980), 9. Kivy expects that his dichotomy be- tween ways of describing music will not be novel for his readers. As he puts it, musicians write technically at a "familiar" cost; the alternative is the "familiar" emotive stance. 8Ibid., 8-9. eyes of the learned, so that it can stand alongside of technical descrip- tion as a valid analytic tool.9 So Kivy intends his defense of emotive description as a defense of the criticism that amateurs can read-at any rate, those ama- teurs who are "humanistically educated." But Kivy is not only, perhaps not primarily, concerned with the needs of musical am- ateurs. Kivy argues that ascriptions of emotional properties can be intelligible, objective, and relevant to aesthetic evaluation. If Kivy is right that emotional properties often contribute to the value of a composition, then anyone who cares about music should want to know about them. The emotive description that interests Kivy has two defining traits. It ascribes emotional expressiveness to the piece, rather than ascribing emotions to the composer or listener,?0 and it should be taken literally, not as "nonsense" that somehow guides the listener's perception." Kivy associates emotive criti- cism especially with the writings of Donald F. Tovey, whose fa- mous Essays in Musical Analysis originated as program notes for concerts in which Tovey appeared as conductor or pianist.12 Kivy is astute in choosing Tovey to exemplify popular criticism: not only are Tovey's essays accessible to readers with diverse musical backgrounds, but many professional musicians and mu- sical scholars consider Tovey one of the most insightful analysts, in his program notes no less than in his more professionally ori- ented works.13 Many musicians would grant that an interpreta- tion and defense of Tovey's criticism is a valuable undertaking. 9Ibid., 9. l?Ibid., 6-7. 1Ibid., 9-10. 12Kivy introduces the discussion of emotive criticism by quoting some of Tovey's analytical writing (p. 6), and at the end of his essay he indicates that his arguments have vindicated Tovey's critical practice (p. 149). Kivy mentions only one other contemporary writer, H. C. Robbins Landon, as a practitioner of emotive description (p. 120). 13According to Joseph Kerman, "for richness, consistency, and complete- ness, Tovey's Beethoven stands out as the most impressive achievement, per-</page><page sequence="4">Music as Drama 59 Though one is grateful for Kivy's clarity, his project is much too simply conceived. If Kivy succeeds in defending emotive de- scription so that it can "stand alongside of technical descrip- tion," he is left with an obvious puzzle about musical experi- ence. When he concludes his defense of emotive description, it seems that music can be described in two very different ways. These two ways use quite different vocabularies, and many peo- ple can only understand one kind of description, although both ways of describing music constitute "valid criticism." Assuming that the two kinds of description bring out different aspects of music, what is the relation of these aspects? What is it like to hear a composition that has such diverse qualities? How might the experiences of listeners with different vocabularies differ? Do the two vocabularies record two completely different ways of experiencing music? Or do perceptions of musical structure and perceptions of emotional expression simply "stand along- side of' each other in musical experience? Or is there some way of unifying these different aspects within a single coherent expe- rience? At several points Kivy's essay touches on the relation be- tween emotional aspects of music and other aspects. Kivy won- ders whether it is possible to listen to music without perceiving its expressiveness: Some people claim to, and I suppose we should take their word for it. I suspect, though, that the most plausible way of looking at it is as a matter of selective attention. A listener can, I think, decide to focus on the expressive qualities of music, or to focus on some other aspect instead. Whether one can totally extirpate one's perception of musi- cal expressiveness I tend to doubt, but am prepared to believe if brought to it.14 haps, yet produced by the art of music criticism." (Kerman, "Tovey's Beethoven," in Alan Tyson, ed., Beethoven Studies 2 [London: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1977], 191.) 14Kivy, The Corded Shell, 59. This is an intriguing suggestion, but Kivy's claim that one can focus selectively on different aspects of music does not commit him to any view about the way a listener might integrate those aspects. When Kivy presents his theory of musical expression, he ar- gues that various features of pieces, identifiable under technical descriptions, are naturally or conventionally expressive. For ex- ample, he connects musical contour with expressive inflection in speech, the diminished triad with restlessness, and the minor triad with "the darker side of the emotive spectrum."15 But such correlations leave the relation between different aspects of mu- sic obscure, for it seems that emotive and technical descriptions interpret the same features of a piece in quite different ways. A conventional musical analyst might try, for instance, to under- stand the motivic relations among the details of the piece, and he or she might try to place the details in a larger musical pro- gression described in technical vocabulary. Kivy's approach takes the details one by one and associates them with emotional states, presumably interpreting their succession in terms of a co- herently developing series of emotional states. This leaves a var- iant of the original puzzle about Kivy's position: can the two kinds of description come together in a single unified descrip- tion of a piece, or do they reflect two fundamentally disparate ways of regarding the same details? No account of music as a loose conjunction between, on one hand, ingeniously patterned sounds, and on the other hand, ex- pressions or evocations of various emotional states, will be plau- sible. A better account must consider, much more centrally than does Kivy's essay, the extent to which a composition can unify its different aspects. Given the confusing, fragmented image of music in Kivy's treatment, it is easy to see why theorists like Lerdahl and Jack- endoff, or Epstein, have suggested the priority of theory and 15Ibid., 46-56, 71-83.</page><page sequence="5">60 Music Theory Spectrum analysis over more humanizing forms of interpretation. Edward T. Cone has argued similarly: "If verbalization of true content-the specific expression uniquely embodied in a work-is possible at all, it must depend on close structural anal- ysis."16 Rather than dismantling music into loosely related com- ponents, these writers argue, one should begin with what is sol- idly established-the insights of theory and analysis-building from this knowledge toward an understanding of "affect," "ex- pression," "content," "meaning," ... The discussion so far points toward an attractive but inade- quate position on the relation between music theory and the broader issues of music criticism and aesthetics. The position can be summarized in four claims: (1) Music theory and musical analysis constitute an autonomous discipline, capable of estab- lishing its methods and achieving results without drawing on other ways of interpreting music. (2) Theory and analysis study one aspect of music, namely its "structure." (3) The "structure" of a composition is only one of its aspects. Among the others, one is particularly crucial for criticism and aesthetics. It is hard to name, because the common designations-"expression," "affect," "content," etc.--all imply controversial commit- ments. But this other aspect is closely linked in some way to hu- man feeling or emotion, and it may also have affinities with lin- guistic meaning. (4) An attempt to articulate this unnamed humanistic aspect of music must draw on the solid achievements of theory and analysis. Ignoring the findings of theory and anal- ysis will lead to a fragmentary, unconvincing account of other aspects of music. I am in partial agreement with this position. Certainly it im- proves upon Kivy's views. Theory and analysis have achieved many insights into tonal music, and a more ambitious aesthetic theory must draw on those insights and place them in a convinc- 16Edward T. Cone, "Schubert's Promissory Note," Nineteenth Century Music 5/3 (1982): 233. ing relation to its own claims. But I find the received notion of musical "structure," as an aspect of music that can be distin- guished from "meaning," to be vague and obscure. Further, the position that I have summarized places far too much weight on the role of emotion in musical experience. It will take considerable exposition to clarify and motivate these points of disagreement. Reflections on a Passage by Beethoven To move toward a more general understanding of music, it will be helpful to reflect at length on a particular musical exam- ple. The beginning of Beethoven's String Quartet, opus 95, (Ex. 1) is richly complex, inviting close scrutiny. In this section I begin with detailed description of the first seventeen mea- sures, interrupting the description twice for some preliminary commentary. I have not restricted the description to the lan- guage provided by conventional music theory; rather, I have tried to articulate my understanding of the passage as clearly and flexibly as possible, using music-theoretical language along with other kinds of description. After the Beethoven analysis, I move to a more general consideration of the kind of musical thought instantiated in the description.17 Analysis. Loud, aggressive, astonishingly brief, surrounded by silence-the initial abrupt outburst leaves much unresolved complexity, even confusion. It is strangely timed as a whole, arriving forcefully and apparently decisively-no uncertainty among the instruments about the proper course-but ending so quickly, as though that gesture could feel complete and self- sufficient. It is palpably incomplete. The clumsiness of the pas- sage, its awkward incompleteness, comes largely from its inter- 17By working from a detailed analysis to more general claims, obviously I run the risk that some readers will disagree with some or much of the analysis. Such readers may still find interest in the generalizations that follow, provided they believe that there are satisfactory analyses that conform to my generaliza- tions. (In any case, the analysis is offered as one way of hearing the passage, one option among many for me or for any other listener.)</page><page sequence="6">Music as Drama 61 Example 1.

The change from sixteenths to eighths articulates the opening strangely; the placing of Dl and C creates rhythmic conflict and confusion. The sixteenth notes, along with the rep- etition of the opening F, suggest a quarter-note pulse, and to some extent that pulse gives greater weight to the Dl than to the C. But this creates a bizarre neighboring motion, the elabo- rated note altering between its two appearances! The pitches are easier to understand as a line descending from F to C and returning to F, passing through the pitches that most conven- tionally appear in ascents and descents in minor. But this latter pitch configuration gives special weight to the C, contrary to the implied quarter-note pulse. Rhythmic ambivalence comes along with harmonic uncer- tainty. Heard as rhythmically stressed, the Db creates some sense that D[, rather than C goes together with the emphasized Fs and the top AN to make a background triad for these two bars; this sense is muddled or contradicted by the D in the as- cent to F-muddled rather than wiped out. C, taken as part of a background triad, would give a second inversion, that is, a dis- sonant, unstable form, of the F-AkI-C triad. Perhaps the C can be heard as resolving D I, but as standing for a V chord (extend- ing through a consonant E at the end of the bar). This last might be the most satisfactory harmony for the passage, but still the rhythmic location of the implied V is vague, and the passage does not in itself suggest such importance for the E; so this in- terpretation feels more like the listener's desperate imposition of a familiar stereotype than like a report on the harmonies pro- jected by this very passage. Commentary. The analysis uses traditional music- theoretical vocabulary and relies on traditional assumptions about tonal music-that pitch and rhythm go together most simply when their hierarchies align, that neighboring structures normally begin and end with the same pitch, not with an altered version of the same scale-step, and so on. Correct labelling us- f J</page><page sequence="8">Music as Drama 63 ing theoretical vocabulary, and comparison of the Beethoven passage to the common procedures of musical succession sum- marized in theoretical generalities, are essential parts of the analysis. But the analysis begins by calling the opening a loud, aggressive, abrupt outburst, calling it clumsy, incomplete. These are not technical terms of music theory. Nor do they name emotional qualities, though they do anthropomorphize the passage somewhat, describing it as one might describe a person or a human action. In the analysis they function as gen- eral descriptions of the music, the theoretical description serv- ing to amplify and substantiate. The clumsiness or incomplete- ness of the music is not hard to hear, but it is heard more precisely when one is sharply aware of the disproportion cre- ated by the sixteenth notes, dividing the music into a short span-but not an upbeat!-set against a much longer, slower span, or when one is sharply aware of the particular lack of fo- cus created by skewing of pitch structure and meter. Both sorts of description-"technical" or music-theoretical, "dramatic" or anthropomorphically evocative-belong, interacting, to the analysis. If the "specifically musical" descriptions do not supplant the others, then the more animistic or anthropomorphic descrip- tions, attributing to the piece qualities of human action-"an aggressive, abrupt outburst, forceful and apparently decisive"-need further attention and reflection. Analysis, continued. The next outburst (mm. 3-5) invites comparison to the first: again, loud, aggressive, and sur- rounded by silence, but this second attack is not quite so brief; indeed, it is long enough to seem very repetitious by the end, even while it sustains the sense of frustratingly halting succes- sion. The increased duration feels like a response to the exces- sive brevity of the first passage, while the repetitiousness marks the response as less than successful. In other respects as well the new passage registers an aware- ness of peculiarities of the opening and an effort to clarify, but again there is abruptness throughout, and new peculiarities ap- pear. Response to the earlier problems comes in various ways. The rhythmic complexities of the opening yield to an almost ob- sessional clarification and simplification. In m. 3 the first violin refers to the stressed second beat of m. 1, but now the emphasis belongs to what is obviously an offbeat pattern, clearly subordi- nated to the stronger beats stressed by the lower instruments. The lower instruments also emphasize a division of the bar into halves, responding to the uncertain articulation of the third beat in m. 1. In the next measure all four instruments join to divide the bar neatly in half. And when, in the next bar, the earlier stress on the second beat appears, it no longer subverts the strength of the first or third beat, rather appearing as an af- tereffect to the strong downbeat, almost an echo. The pulling- in of the register and move from a full triad to a bare octave not only subordinates the second beat to the first, but the silence on the third beat is a natural continuation of this fading away. This last effect, then, refers to the opening bar, divided into 1+3 beats, reproducing the disproportion but rendering it appropri- ate and undisturbing. The passage also refers to the pitch-related obscurities of the opening, offering clean, simple reworkings of the pitch mate- rial. The whole three-bar passage harps on the dominant triad, vaguely suggested at the opening; and in particular, the outer parts pound on the pitch C on strong beats (even the first vio- lin's offbeat pattern places C in stronger positions than in m. 1). Earlier there was an obscure suggestion of a second-inversion F triad; now such a triad appears unequivocally, emerging from and resolving into V chords. The definiteness of the dominant harmonies, with subordinated tonic harmonies distinctly inter- posed, makes the possible glimpse of V in m. 1 seem, in retro- spect, too dim to be believable. To some extent this second out- burst reshapes the first as essentially a long tonic chord to be succeeded by a long dominant. However, the sound of that tonic remains cluttered with intimations of other harmonies. Throughout there is, strangely, no hint of the Dl, nor of the Dt which was at odds with it. And even more disturbing is the</page><page sequence="9">64 Music Theory Spectrum registral discontinuity between the two outbursts, the second disregarding until quite late the lower register of the first, while opening without transition an area extending a tenth above the original upper boundary. This upper region contains only first violin Cs, which perhaps associates the pitch and registral pecu- liarities of this response especially with something like hysteria on the part of the first violin. More generally, the completely unmediated contrast of textures-octave-doubled theme fol- lowed by tuneless chords-gives the two passages a mutual re- pulsion that keeps them from settling into any persuasive conti- nuity. So far, then, the events of this piece are a rough, abrupt ini- tial outburst, and a second outburst which responds to many peculiar features of the opening but also ignores some of its sali- ent aspects, matching the roughness and abruptness of the opening and combining urgent response to the first passage with a strained disjunction. Commentary. The analysis continues to include specific de- scription in music-theoretical terms, again in interaction with general descriptions that do not use specifically musical vocab- ulary. A crucial element becomes prominent: events are ex- plained, the analysis gives reasons for their occurrence. The analysis treats the second passage as in many ways a reasoned response to the first. The first passage was rhythmically con- fused; that gives a reason for the second passage to respond with corresponding rhythmic clarifications; rhythmic features of the second passage are explained by citing such reasons. The first passage was harmonically obscure; that gives a reason for the second passage to respond with corresponding harmonic clarity, retrospectively simplifying the harmonic feel of the first passage somewhat and integrating the two passages into a sin- gle clear harmonic succession, or trying to. Analysis of the next few measures will show a continuation of this drama of abrupt action and response, confirming the ap- propriateness of the analysis so far but introducing no new modes of interpretation. Analysis, concluded. The next passage, from m. 6 to the first beat of m. 18, retraces the preceding events: there is a return to the motive of the opening, then something which is like the sec- ond outburst in amounting to a long, decorated V chord. As mm. 3-5 responded to mm. 1-2, mm. 6-18 respond, more ade- quately, to all the preceding events. The passage is long and continuous, continually purposeful, neither abrupt nor repeti- tious. Addition of an explicit chord to the cello's repetition of the opening motive makes the harmony unambiguous. Because the harmony is clear, and because a meter has already been es- tablished, the placement of a passing tone on the third beat raises no special problems. In the present setting the motive seems much more straightforward. That second-beat chord hardens the break between the six- teenth notes and eighths in the cello motive, reviving and inten- sifying the earlier disproportion. But relatively unemphatic syncopations (mm. 8, 10, 12) refer quietly to the chordal attack, placing softer attacks in a metrically straightforward context, absorbing the blow until by m. 14 rhythms align simply with the meter-a gradual, tactful procedure. The previously slighted D[, now exerts its influence: the opening returns in Gb major, which bears the same relation to the tonic key that Db bears to C, and a key in which Db is part of the tonic triad, as the first violin demonstrates. From this starting-point there is a slow move to the dominant. Not only does the move to V (mm. 8-9) spell out the semitone relation between the keys of Gb and F (their dominants are connected by an utterly literal semitone descent), but the Db to C connec- tion is singled out as special by delays of both pitches. The strat- egy: since previously there was an outburst with a problematic Db, and a response that seemed to ignore the Db, compensate by imitating the first outburst but doing something wilder than the Dl, was (but like the D,), and resolve it explicitly to some- thing like the initial response. The beginning of the response is a little startling; it creates another sharp break between contig-</page><page sequence="10">Music as Drama 65 uous gestures, having little to do with the tonic and dominant chords that immediately precede it; but since its motive and harmony link it primarily to the first gesture of the piece, this local disjunction is not as disturbing as the contrast between the first and second outbursts. Explicit resolution of the Db to C continues in the first violin tune (mm. 12-15), twice by putting Db in a much weaker rhyth- mic position than C, once by putting the D, on the third beat of the bar and resolving it unambiguously to C. The first violin in this passage sticks to the new register it opened in bar 3; the high register was abruptly and irrelevantly opened, but now the first violin assimilates it to the other registers that have been used by repeating in this register the features of lower registers (an F triad with C as the lowest note, Cs neighbored by D[,s). Mm. 13-15 refer back to the earlier alternating tonic and dominant chords, but slowly, smoothly. And rather than elimi- nating the problematic Db, these measures include it, along with D1, in clear relation to the primary chords. And then, re- calling the possible mingling of Dl and F triads at the opening, m. 16 places a D6 triad in the position that might have been occupied by F minor, leading the Dl up to D1 while placing a chromatic lower neighbor to C, as if to diminish the import of the Dl by providing a symmetrical semitone neighbor, the two closing in on the structurally focal C. In place of the earlier dis- regard of the problematic D 6, here is elaborate, lucid acknowl- edgement of the pitch, placing it in vivid, definite relation to F minor. The Db triad also does much to assimilate the Gb sound, absorbing it and placing it in the governing tonality. The present passage occupies the combined registral spread of the opening outbursts, forming one seamless space from reg- isters that had contrasted sharply. The piece now seems to have opened a wide registral span by successively opening two sub- spans. Within this space the cello has a special role. Having be- gun the passage by retrieving the opening motive, the cello maintains a special concern with the beginning of the piece: its remarkable ascent and descent (mm. 10-17) occupy the regis- tral spread that was occupied at the opening by the entire en- semble, referring to those boundaries but showing them to have been narrow. The earlier textural discontinuity is absorbed into a single developing process. What felt like a jarring succession of extremes-line versus chords-now appears within a process of increasingly independent instrumental parts. Stages of the process: octave doubling; chords, with some rhythmic diver- sity; line and chords; polyphonically independent, rhythmically diverse parts. The return to the opening motive and texture in m. 18 groups the first seventeen measures together as a separate stage of the action, and the analysis of those measures has already provided sufficient basis for the following discussion. However, it is worth noting briefly that the issues arising in the opening measures remain fundamental concerns in the continuation of the piece. The abrupt return to the opening raises new ques- tions about the status of Dl and now G6 as well, and the subse- quent tonicization of Db attempts to draw the disheveled pitch materials into a new stability. The major-mode return of this material in the recapitulation reenacts the suppression of Db in mm. 3-5, giving urgency to the final return of F minor. Con- cern about the metrical placement and resolution of D b persists to the last measures of the movement. Of course, to explore these later developments fully would require a lengthy analysis. It would be natural to call the quartet a conspicuously dra- matic composition, and the analysis makes the sense of drama concrete by narrating a succession of dramatic actions: an abrupt, inconclusive outburst; a second outburst in response, abrupt and coarse in its attempt to compensate for the first; a response to the first two actions, calmer and more careful, in many ways more satisfactory. I suggest that the notion of action is crucial in understanding the Beethoven passage. A listener follows the music by drawing</page><page sequence="11">66 Music Theory Spectrum on the skills that allow understanding of commonplace human action in everyday life. In transferring those skills from the con- text of ordinary human behavior to the more specialized con- text of musical events, a listener can retain some forms of inter- pretation relatively unchanged, while other habits of thought must be changed to fit the new context.18 In order to under- stand the use of these skills in hearing music, it will be helpful to begin with some generalizations about nonmusical contexts. The related notions of action, behavior, intention, agent, and so on, figure in a scheme of explanation or interpretation that applies to human beings (also, more controversially or problematically, to some animals and to sophisticated ma- chines, for instance, chess-playing computers). The scheme works by identifying certain events as actions and offering a dis- tinctive kind of explanation for those events. The explanations ascribe sets of psychological states to an agent, states that make the action appear reasonable to the agent and that cause the action. The explanatory psychological states can be divided roughly into epistemic states (beliefs and the like) and motiva- tional states (desires and the like). Ascriptions of psychological states are constrained by the need for the agent to shape up as an intelligible person: fairly coherent, consistent, rational, and so on. Besides beliefs and desires, one important class of ex- 18In focusing on musical action, and most obviously in my discussion of fictional "musical agents," I have been influenced by Edward T. Cone's excel- lent study The Composer's Voice (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1974). The importance of that book has not yet been sufficiently recognized by music theorists. To trace the precise pattern of agreement and disagreement between Cone's ideas and mine would require a separate and rather intricate essay; here I can only record my indebtedness to his work. I encountered Roger Scruton's fine essay "Understanding Music" (in his The Aesthetic Un- derstanding [London: Methuen, 1983]) after formulating the claims and argu- ments of this paper, but I am pleased by the similarity between his position and mine. Three other models that were influential for me: work by Flint Schier in aesthetics, and the art criticism of Adrian Stokes and Michael Fried. planatory states includes character traits, moods, and emo- tions. These function in a variety of ways: they can affect episte- mic and motivational states, and they sometimes help to explain failures of consistency or rationality.19 What shows that an event is being regarded as an action? Some words are consistently associated with actions; to say that some event is a theft is always to classify that event as an action. Other words sometimes designate actions, sometimes not; knocking down a snowman might be an action, but if I slip on the ice, bumping the snowman by accident, and it falls, my knocking it down is not an action. More generally, it is a neces- sary condition for an action that it can be explained by citing the agent's reasons, by ascribing an appropriate configuration of psychological states.20 The Beethoven analysis includes some terms that always in- dicate actions. An abrupt outburst, for instance, is always an action, and so is a reasoned response. But also, the explana- tions the analysis gives for events in the piece, beginning espe- cially in the description of mm. 3-5, cite reasons consisting of psychological states, explaining the events of the piece just as actions are explained. Consider again the analysis of mm. 3-5: many features of the second outburst are explained by ascribing an intention to respond to the first outburst and beliefs about 19For careful and influential explorations of the point, see Donald David- son, Essays on Actions and Events (New York: Oxford University Press, 1980). My account draws largely on Davidson's views. Along with Davidson's work, G. E. M. Anscombe, Intention (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1957) was crucial in establishing the study of action as a central preoccupation of current analytic philosophy. Sophisticated, engaging, recent work includes Daniel Dennett, Brainstorms (Montgomery: Bradford Books, 1978); Christopher Peacocke, Holistic Explanation (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979); Adam Morton, Frames of Mind (New York: Oxford University Press, 1980); and Jennifer Hornsby, Actions (Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1980). 20These generalizations simplify, but not in ways that affect the musical ap- plications. For discussion of necessary and sufficient conditions for an event to be an action, see Davidson, Essays, and Peacocke, Holistic Explanation.</page><page sequence="12">Music as Drama 67 the precise points of unclarity in the opening gesture. For in- stance, the description points out that the passage presents cer- tain pitch material, which was more obscurely presented be- fore, and in depicting this as a response, it ascribes thoughts which refer to the opening, that is, thoughts that the opening had certain features which make a compensating action appro- priate. Something like this: "That outburst left a vague, equiv- ocal sense of a dominant triad. That is unsatisfactory, and one way to deal with the situation is to present a dominant triad more straightforwardly, leaving no doubt about what I mean." The thought is ascribed to explain an action, the action that the thought shows as rational. More formally, one can identify beliefs-"There was something vague about the harmony at the opening; a straightforward alternation of tonic and domi- nant would be much clearer"-and a desire-"I want to re- place the sound of the opening with something clearer"- combining to give a reason for acting. Saying that the passage harps on the dominant suggests that the response is repetitious and perhaps a little out of control. While the contents of mm. 3-5 warrant this description, there is a further suggestion that the same mood or character trait that led to the initial outburst continues to operate, infecting the re- sponse with a certain clumsiness, both internally and in its rela- tion to the first outburst. As with the ascription of thoughts, the ascription of mood or character to explain events resembles ex- planation of actual behavior. In general, the description of the Beethoven passage ex- plains events by regarding them as actions and suggesting moti- vation, reasons why those actions are performed, and the rea- sons consist of combinations of psychological states. But to whom are these ascriptions of action and thought made? It might be thought that these descriptions are straight- forward accounts of what the composer did in composing the piece, or what performers do in performing it. Two consider- ations show that these suggestions are too simple. First, if the analysis contains description of an action or mo- tivation that cannot be ascribed to the composer or performers, and if this fact does not show that the analysis is wrong, then it seems the analysis involves the ascription of at least one action to an imaginary agent. Consider again the account of mm. 3-5: the second outburst is an abrupt, clumsy response to the first outburst. But that does not mean that Beethoven penned the opening, noticed its unresolved complexities, and hastily penned a rough response. (Maybe he did, but that is indepen- dent of what the analysis claims.) Neither is it the case that Beethoven pretended to respond roughly and hastily; there is no sense of play or pretense about that response, which sounds earnest. Nor does the analysis describe the actual response of the members of the string quartet. An essential part of the pas- sage is the feeling that the first outburst has taken someone somewhat by surprise, and that the roughness of the second outburst comes from unpreparedness. But the members of the quartet know what is coming next. A second consideration is more general. In listening to a piece, it is as though one follows a series of actions that are per- formed now, before one's ears, not as though one merely learns of what someone (Beethoven) did years ago. And in following the musical actions, it is as though the future of the agent is open-as though what he will do next is not already deter- mined. But then the actions are not straightforwardly those of the composer, whose (relevant) sections are all in the past, nor of the performers, whose future actions are already prescribed. But these considerations are not conclusive. They indicate that some kind of imaginative activity or construction of fiction figures in understanding music. That might involve the ascrip- tion of actions and psychological states to fictional characters; but it might equally, for all these arguments have shown, in- volve the creation of fictionalized versions of the composer or performers. For instance, if I follow musical actions as though they are presently taking place, I could be following the actions</page><page sequence="13">68 Music Theory Spectrum of imaginary agents, but I could rather be imagining that the composer is presently performing those actions. Or if I follow actions of which the future is open, I could be following the actions of imaginary agents or I could be imagining that the per- formers are improvising. The analysis does not answer these questions about agency; indeed, at many points the Beethoven analysis is evasive about specifying an agent. For example, "the next outburst ... regis- ters an awareness of peculiarities of the opening and an effort to clarify ... The whole three-bar passage harps on the dominant triad." The first sentence mentions an outburst, an awareness of something and an effort, without identifying anyone to whom these thoughts and actions belong. The second sentence seems to say that a passage does something: but perhaps this is a way of saying that the passage is a harping on the dominant, again without specifying a musical agent. Such evasions might seem to be omissions, gaps that a fuller analysis would fill. I suggest, however, that the gaps belong in the analysis, that they record an aspect of musical experience. The evasions reflect a pervasive indeterminacy in the identifica- tion of musical agents. Sometimes it seems appropriate to think of the whole texture of a piece as the action of a single agent. In other contexts a differentiation of agents within the texture may be more natural, conspicuously in concerto style, where a solo part interacts with an orchestra, but also in many less ex- treme contexts. For instance: "the first violin refers to the stressed second beat of m. 1 . . . The lower instruments also emphasize a division of the bar into halves." What questions about individuation does such a passage answer? Does it, for instance, show that the first violin part in this passage corre- sponds to the activity of a single agent, determinately set apart from the rest of the ensemble? But why not think of the first violin part as somewhat like one limb of an agent who has sev- eral limbs and can do several things at once? And what about the other three instruments-are they three agents cooperat- ing, or a single agent producing chords? Further, the distinction between first violin and lower instruments is sharp in m. 3 of the Beethoven (as described by the excerpt just quoted), but de- creases in the following measures; the first violin retains indi- viduality in that it contributes only Cs, while the other instru- ments play more different pitches, but the rhythmic unison suggests a single chord-producing agent. And-whatever is shown by the dissociation of the first violin from the other instruments-this is only a small part of a piece in which the four instruments continue to play; what does the temporary distinctness of the first violin mean for the dramatis personae of the rest of the piece? Indeed, what is the relation, in terms of the identity of the agent, between the opening outburst and mm. 3-5? The inde- terminacy here is reflected by another evasion in the language of the analysis: nowhere is it clear whether the response to the first outburst is made by the same agent or agents. If the conti- nuity in the performing forces suggests continuity of the musi- cal agency, the registral discontinuity and utterly different treatment of the ensemble may suggest that a distinct agent or agents have entered to respond. (Consider also the prominence of the first violin in m. 3; at the opening, the first violin merely doubles the second, so at m. 3 the first violin enters somewhat as a new character.) Questions like these arise naturally, and they do not invite determinate answers. The actions that a listener follows in lis- tening to the Beethoven passage do not belong to determi- nately distinct agents. More precisely, as the listener discerns actions and explains them by psychological states, various dis- criminations of agents will seem appropriate, but never with a determinacy that rules out other interpretations. The claim is not that different listeners may interpret the music differently (though they undoubtedly will), but rather that a single listen- er's experience will include a play of various schemes of individ- uation, none of them felt as obligatory. If this is correct, then the thoughts connected with music are not just a matter of imagining the composer's actions as occur-</page><page sequence="14">Music as Drama 69 ring in the present. Were that the case, indeterminacy about the musical agent would not be possible; there would be one agent, whose actions give rise to the entire musical texture, de- terminately continuous from beginning to end of a piece. Nor does a listener simply imagine that the performers before him are improvising, or otherwise cast them in dramatic roles like actors in a play; once again, a determinate set of agents would result. However, it remains possible that the play of interpreta- tions within this indeterminacy would include interactions in- volving fictionalized representations of the composer and per- formers. As indicated in the commentaries, the analysis mingles standard music-theoretical vocabulary with other sorts of de- scription. The anthropomorphic language, I suggested, be- longs to the analysis because the analysis reports an experience of the music as a succession of actions. A crucial question re- mains: what is the relation between the actions I have discussed-outbursts, attempts to resolve-and the music- theoretical language of the analysis? The musical terminology includes some phrases (e.g., "measures 7-10") that serve mainly to locate parts of the score, but also phrases (e.g., "the change from sixteenths to eighths," "a rhythmic strong point," "the pulling in of the register and move from a full triad to a bare octave") which describe the way the music sounds in per- formance. It is the latter language, and its relation to the more overtly dramatic language, that is interesting. The first point to observe is that the technical language and the dramatic language offer descriptions of the same events. That event at the opening of the quartet, according to the anal- ysis, is an outburst and it is also a unison passage with an ob- scure relation between metrical hierarchy and pitch hierarchy. The technical vocabulary of the analysis describes the actions that make up the piece. To develop this point into something more interesting, fur- ther reflection on ordinary non-musical action will be helpful. Suppose I write an address on an envelope. That action has many different descriptions; for example, I have addressed a letter, used some ink, misspelled part of the address, embossed the address on one page of the enclosed letter, moved my hand in an elaborate pattern, and so forth. Some of these descrip- tions, but not all of them, are pertinent in understanding why I want to perform the action; or to put the point differently, the action is intentional under some descriptions, but not under others. I intentionally address a letter, I do not intentionally misspell some words. Again, my action can be evaluated in var- ious ways according to various criteria, and given certain crite- ria some descriptions will be pertinent to evaluating the action while others will not. Descriptions that bear on evaluation will not necessarily be the same as those under which the action is intentional. For an evaluation of my social skills, it may be im- portant that there are misspellings and that the pen has made indentations on the letter in the envelope. Much of the theoretical language of the analysis not only de- scribes the actions of the piece, but describes them in ways that show the intention with which the action is performed. To ex- plain the second outburst, the analysis implies an intention to respond to harmonic obscurity with a clear alternation of domi- nant and tonic chords. Other language, not providing a descrip- tion of an act as intentional, nonetheless provides descriptions that pertain to evaluations that motivate subsequent actions. The metrical and harmonic obscurities of the first outburst, as it is depicted in the analysis, seem consequences of its haste and abruptness, not features intended by the musical agent or agents.21 Those obscurities, though, are recognized and moti- 21This point depends on a crucial distinction between Beethoven's histori- cal intentions and those of the agents in the piece. Suppose a dramatist writes that a character should trip and fall at a certain point in a play. The dramatist intends the clumsiness, but in an important sense it is not his or her clumsiness, and within the world of the play the clumsiness is not intentional. A similar distinction holds for the quartet. Perhaps Beethoven intended the passage to be clumsy. Still it makes sense to say that this is not Beethoven's clumsiness, and that it is not intentional in the world of the quartet.</page><page sequence="15">70 Music Theory Spectrum vate later attempts to compensate. The theoretical language provides a description that bears on an evaluation of the pas- sage; that description then figures in the thoughts of the agents of the piece when they evaluate the first outburst and formulate a response.22 In short, the music-theoretical language in the Beethoven analysis gives descriptions of the actions in the piece, bringing out aspects that are pertinent in describing and evaluating the events as actions. This point is not trivial: it should not be taken for granted that descriptions of actions happen to be pertinent to their explanation and evaluation. Consider, for instance, the descriptions that a physiologist might give of my bodily move- ments in addressing a letter, sealing it, and walking to the mail- box. The physiologist might produce accurate anatomical de- scriptions of my actions, but those descriptions would not show how I thought of the actions in deciding to perform them, nor would they be relevant for most criteria of evaluating my actions. Because of the relevance of the theoretical descrip- tions in explanation and evaluation, that language also figures in attribution of thought to the musical agents. While the theoretical language of the analysis most obvi- ously designates actions, a further indeterminacy concerning agency enlarges the possible dramatic functions of theoretical language. In everyday contexts, there is a sharp distinction be- tween agent and action. Agents and actions are different sorts of things: an agent is, for instance, me, an animal of a certain size, shape, and history, while my actions are transient events. But in musical thought, agents and actions sometimes collapse into one another. An F minor triad or the opening motive of the Beethoven quartet might be regarded as actions, perhaps typi- 22The last three paragraphs are indebted to Davidson. See especially "Agency," "The Logical Form of Action Sentences," and "The Individuation of Events," in Essays on Actions and Events. Davidson's views are controver- sial. Other positions on the individuation of actions and events would allow me to make the same points, but in a more cumbersome way. cal actions of some recurring character; but they might instead be regarded as agents, as characters within the composition. This issue does not arise in the language of the Beethoven anal- ysis, except perhaps in its evasiveness, but Schoenberg, for in- stance, writes that "a piece of music resembles in some respects a photograph album, displaying under changing circumstances the life of its basic idea-its basic motive,"23 and similar de- scriptions are common. In Schoenberg's description a motive is treated as a dramatic character. This indeterminacy between sounds as agents and as actions is possible because a musical texture does not provide any recognizable objects, apart from the sounds, that can be agents. If the sound is regarded as action, the listener may also, seeking a perceptible protagonist, attribute those actions to the sounds as agents. In music, Yeats's enigma-how to tell the dancer from the dance-arises continuously and vividly. I will summarize these points about the Beethoven analysis by comparing the Beethoven passage to a stage-play. Compari- sons between drama and music, especially music of the classical period, are commonplace, but the Beethoven analysis makes it possible to specify the comparison in considerable detail.24 It will be useful, for purposes of comparison, to sketch a some- 23Arnold Schoenberg, Fundamentals of Musical Composition (London: Faber and Faber, 1967), 58. 24Tovey and Rosen have written influentially about the dramatic character of the classical style. For characteristic passages, see Donald F. Tovey, "So- nata Forms," in his Musical Articles from the Encyclopedia Britannica (Lon- don: Oxford University Press, 1944), 208-232, and Charles Rosen, The Classi- cal Style (New York: W. W. Norton, 1972), 70-78. Stanley Cavell, "The Avoidance of Love: A Reading of King Lear," in his Must We Mean What We Say? (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1969), 267-353, includes insightful suggestions about music and drama. Cavell writes about music on pp. 320-22 and 352-53, but the point of his remarks depends on much of the rest of the essay. Elliot Carter describes his own music as dramatic in conception. See, for instance, his remarks on the Second String Quartet, in Else Stone and Kurt Stone, eds., The Writings of Elliott Carter (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1977), 278-79.</page><page sequence="16">Music as Drama 71 what simplified, idealized notion of a "normal stage play." Four properties will be relevant: (1) a play presents a series of actions; (2) the actions are performed by fictional characters (or fictionalized representations of mythical or historical figures); (3) for the audience, it is as though the actions are per- formed at the same time as the audience's perception of the actions; and (4) the series of actions forms a plot that holds the actions together in a unified structure. I have suggested that the quartet, like a stage play, presents a series of actions, per- formed by imaginary agents and perhaps fictionalized versions of the composer and performers, and that these actions are heard as taking place in the present. Regarding the fourth prop- erty of a "normal stage play," the structuring of events into a plot, it may seem obvious that the issue arises only for an entire movement or multimovement composition, rather than the opening fragment of a piece. but in fact a definite plot structure is discernible within the opening bars of the quartet. For a perti- nent account of plot one can turn to the work of the contempo- rary literary theorist Tzvetan Todorov. According to Todorov, an ideal narrative begins with a stable situation that some force will perturb. From which results a state of disequilibrium; by the action of a force directed in a converse direction, the equilibrium is re- established; the second equilibrium is quite similar to the first, but the two are not identical.25 25Tzvetan Todorov, Introduction to Poetics, trans. Richard Howard (Min- neapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1981). Todorov has contributed some of the best work toward the construction of a "grammar" of narrative, analo- gous to the grammar of a language. Some other crucial works in this areas are Vladimir Propp, Morphology of the Folktale, trans. Laurence Scott (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1968); Claude Levi-Strauss, "The Structural Study of Myth," in his Structural Anthropology, trans. Claire Jacobsen and Brooke Grundfest Schoepf (Garden City: Anchor Books, 1967); Roland Barthes, "In- troduction to the Structural Analysis of Narrative," in his Image-Music- Text, trans. Stephen Heath (London: Fontana, 1977), and S/Z, trans. Richard Miller (New York: Hill and Wang, 1974). These studies are by now somewhat dated: theoretical work on narrative has recently concentrated more on politi- Todorov's remarks are very suggestive for the general issue of musical plot; musicians will find it easy to think of many ways in which compositions can conform to Todorov's schema. (A par- ticularly obvious example of an "ideal narrative" would be so- nata form.) In applying the schema to the opening of Beethoven's quartet one should remember that Todorov is de- scribing an ideal narrative in which the plot structure is simple and complete. The Beethoven passage can be understood as in- volving a modification of Todorov's schema, in two respects. First, the opening gesture combines the functions of establish- ing an initial state of stability and introducing an imbalance of "disequilibrium": to put it in a very general way, the first two bars establish a certain tonality and meter, but they do so in an obscure or confusing way, thereby introducing a problem that needs to be resolved. A second modification of Todorov's schema appears in the occurrence of two attempts to establish stability, one (in bars 3-5) that is only partly successful, and a second (in the rest of the passage) that responds more success- fully to the opening five bars. The existence of such condensa- tion and overlapping suggests that the Beethoven passage not only organizes its events into a plot, but does so in a particularly sophisticated way. The analogy between the opening of the quartet and the "normal stage play" holds up fairly well. Two points that em- erged earlier qualify the analogy in important ways. First, the actions in the music are not as close to everyday actions as are the actions of nonmusical drama. In a stage play, characters per- cal, psychoanalytic, or rhetorical issues rather than the narrowly formal issues of structuralist analyses. However, the structuralist accounts remain promising for work on musical narrative. Typically such accounts abstract from specific actions and individual characters while generalizing about the patterns of events within "well-formed" narratives: accordingly, this approach seems pe- culiarly well-suited to bringing out similarities between musical and nonmusi- cal narratives.</page><page sequence="17">72 Music Theory Spectrum form actions that occur in everyday life: they make promises, argue, marry, murder, and so on. In the Beethoven passage, the actions have general descriptions which can be satisfied by eve- ryday actions: for instance, there are two outbursts at the begin- ning of the piece, and the second one is an attempt to respond to the first and compensate for it. But these actions also have more detailed descriptions that are "specifically musical": for in- stance, the second outburst responds to the first by establishing a straightforward metrical pattern, by clarifying the pitch struc- ture, and so on. Second, a stage play normally involves a definite number of fictional characters that can be reidentified as the same characters at different points in the play. Hamlet is a different character from Gertrude, and Hamlet in Act V is the same character as Hamlet in Act I (otherwise one could not con- template the extent to which Hamlet might have changed in the course of the play). But the agents in the Beethoven passage are indeterminate. It may seem strange at first to think of music as a kind of drama that lacks determinate characters. The position may seem less strange if one recalls that Aristotle, in the Poetics, considers the traits of individual characters to be less important for a tragedy than the intelligibility and unity of the series of actions in the plot: the most important of all is the structure of the incidents. For Tragedy is an imitation, not of men, but of an action and of life ... Dramatic action, therefore, is not with a view to the representation of charac- ter: character comes in as subsidiary to the action, and of the agents mainly with a view to the action.26 For Aristotle, the imitation of agents in tragedy serves the more essential purpose of imitating an action. Perhaps Aristotle's re- marks can help one grasp the suggestion that music can be dra- 26Aristotle, Poetics, trans. S. H. Butcher (New York: Hill and Wang, 1961), 62-63. matic without imitating or representing determinate characters at all. Musical Structure as Dramatic Structure In light of the preceding discussion, what is the structure of the Beethoven passage? The analogy to drama suggests that the structure of the music is its plot. The structure could be summed up as three large actions, the second responding to the first and the third responding to both earlier actions. Or, fol- lowing Todorov, one could describe the structure in terms of equilibrium and imbalance, in the slightly complicated way that I indicated. But these structures do not imply any distinction between structure and other aspects of the music, for all the de- tail of the analysis simply provides fuller specification of its plot. Nor does this account of structure permit a distinction be- tween "structure" and a more "humanistic" or "emotive" as- pect of the music: humanistic aspects, more precisely the drama and anthropomorphism that I have discussed, are already present as aspects of the plot. But this notion of dramatic structure is different from the notion of "structure" that appeared in the first section of this paper. There, I cited writers who agreed in distinguishing a par- ticular aspect of music, "structure," that is studied in isolation from other aspects by theorists and analysts. How would one isolate the structure, in that sense, of the Beethoven passage'? In particular, does the dramatic or anthropomorphic language contribute to a description of "structure"? Or is it closer to the pole of "meaning" and "expression"? This question is hard to answer with any conviction. The no- tion of "structure" seems stable when it is vaguely specified as some sort of "patterning of sounds" and placed in opposition to "affect," "emotion," and so on. When the picture is complicated-and given greater verisimilitude-by introduc- tion of the dramatic aspects I have presented, the contrast breaks down.</page><page sequence="18">Music as Drama 73 The contrast breaks down at both ends. In light of a detailed narration of musical drama, it becomes very implausible that emotion occupies a privileged role in musical experience. A writer who believes that emotion is the only link between music and ordinary human life will stress emotion heavily in explain- ing the importance of music. But the Beethoven passage is con- nected to everyday life by action, belief, desire, mood, and so on.27 In short, the quartet analysis, along with my subsequent commentary, does little to support the notion of musical struc- 27Kivy's The Corded Shell, as I indicated earlier, relies uncritically on a sharp distinction between technical and emotive description of music. Curi- ously, however, there is a brief passage in which one can glimpse a promising unification of his account of musical experience, along the same lines that I have been exploring. Kivy observes that to regard a piece as expressive is to regard it animistically. In order to defend the ascription of emotional expres- sion to music, he argues that ascription of emotion to music figures in a much more general pattern of animistic construal: only a moment's reflection on the way we talk about music will reveal, I think, how deeply "animistic" our perception of it really is. A musical theme is frequently de- scribed as a "gesture." A fugue subject is a "statement"; it is "answered" at the fifth by the next "statement" of the theme. A "voice" is still what musicians call a part in a polyphonic composition, even if the part is meant to be played on an instrument rather than sung by a voice. ... we must hear an aural pattern as a vehicle of expression-an utterance or a gesture-before we can hear its expressiveness. (Pp. 58-59) According to Kivy, the vocabulary of technical description reveals that musical events are sometimes construed as utterances or gestures, and it is such utter- ances or gestures that provide the basis for the ascription of emotion. The dichotomy between technical and emotive aspects of music governs Kivy's thinking so powerfully that he can even sketch a position that eliminates the dichotomy, without being led to question the fundamental importance of the dichotomy. ture as a patterning of sounds, the appropriate subject matter of a technical discourse that remains aloof from aesthetic is- sues. For at least some music, a satisfactory account of struc- ture must already be an aesthetically oriented narration of dra- matic action. Evaluation and elaboration of the claims I have made can come from two obvious sources: further detailed analyses, and close interpretation of major texts in music theory and aesthet- ics to see whether dramatic models operate in these texts. The latter task is both important and promising: in fact, it turns out that some of the finest and most influential theorists understand music as a drama of interacting agents. I mentioned Schoen- berg's dramatic construal of motivic patterning; more gener- ally, Schoenberg's Harmonielehre construes pitches and har- monies as agents, struggling for supremacy, and it is notable that his language becomes more animistically dramatic when he addresses the most crucial foundational concepts. Schenker's early work depends on a similar dramatization of pitch rela- tions, and his later work remains pervasively animistic in the context of a very different theory. Tovey is perhaps the most obvious example of a major analyst who explains music by pro- viding a dramatic narrative. (Ironically, Kivy's central example of an emotive analyst turns out not to be predominantly con- cerned with emotion, but rather with narratives in which dra- matic and technical language mix freely, as in my Beethoven quartet description.)28 The prerequisite for such further explo- rations is a clear, if provisional, exposition of the concepts of musical agency, drama, and so on, which the present paper has attempted to provide. 28These brief comments on major theorists summarize detailed interpreta- tions that I hope to publish shortly.</page></plain_text>
