<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tortoise in Mythology and Ritual by Hukam Chand Patyal 1.0. An attempt is made in this paper to find out the role played by the tortoise or turtle in the Vedic and post-Vedic mythology and ritual. In fact, this paper is an enlargement and revision of Patyal (1979). Animals play a very vital part in the religious and mythological beliefs of the Aryans. Usually deities are conceived as anthropomorphic, but still there prevail some theriomorphic conceptions of the deities. In rituals animals are connected with mythological conceptions of the gods. 'Animals, widely believed to have superior power, to sustain, for instance the potency of vegetation, to have mysterious relations, to be a sort of reservoir of power for the socio-religious community, could even be representatives of the god whom they accompanied' (Gonda 1969: 147). Totemism and all theriomorphic features involve problems of symbolism, imagery, and the consciousness of human personality in its relation to animal and other life. The tortoise is a reptile par excellence which plays a very significant role in mythology and ritual. 1.1. In Sanskrit the words k?rma, kasyapa, kacchapa, etc. mean 'tortoise or turtle'. The tortoise is a member of the reptilian order Testudinata or Chelonia. All marine and some fresh-water species are named 'turtle'; most of the species found in smaller ponds and marshy places are 'water-tortoises' a few being designated as 'terrapins'; while the terrestrial ones irrespective of their size are 'land-tortoises'. About 300 living species are available in the world (see Encyclopaedia Americana, 27.286-87). 2.0. Tortoise in the Vedic Mythology Anthropomorphic, theriomorphic, and fetishistic conceptions are equally significant in the Vedic mythology. In fact, in the Veda mythology, ritual and religion are intermingled and they cannot be separated from each other. In the aetiological or cosmogonic myths the animals, possessed of sacrosanctity, are closely associated. In many countries the tortoise or turtle is considered as one of the mythical animals on which the world rests (see, e.g., N.W. Thomas in ERE, 1.530; Waida in Eliade, ed., 1987: 15.96-7, etc.). Cosmogony in many savage religions is too well-known. Every mythical account of the origin of anything presupposes and continues the cosmogony (Eliade 1963: 21). Cosmogonic myth in essence continues a 'sacred history', which [1] 97</page><page sequence="2">describes the beginnings of the world, the role which this primordial stage plays differs widely in man's religious conception (Kuiper 1970: 91). 2.1. The popular tortoise myth was perhaps borrowed from popular belief. Its central figure Kasyapa, the father of creatures, plays a very significant role in the cosmogonic and genealogical conception of Vedic people (cf. e.g. AVS, 8.5.14), in exerting fertilizing influences and in granting stability of the world, it has qualities in common with the creator god (Praj?pati) who is the pratisth? (SatBr, 7.1.2.1 f.; see Gonda 1986: 68). Praj?pati, the creator god, assumed the form of a tortoise to produce all creatures, and all creatures are said to have descended from the tortoise (SatBr, 7.5.1.5) (l). The name k?rma is said to be synonymous with kasyapa. He is identified with primeval Purusa from whom by means of the sacrifice the gods created the whole universe, and also men and gods. The tortoise is identified with the yonder sun (SatBr, 7.5.1.6). The sun creeps over the three worlds in the form of a tortoise (SatBr, 7.5.1.9, etc.). The tortoise is also said to be the (life-)breath, for it creates all creatures (SatBr, 7.5.1.7). In VdjaS (13.31) the tortoise is elevated to the position of 'lord of waters'. In ancient mythology the tortoise belonged to Varuna, the lord of waters, thereby it (the tortoise) also became 'lord of waters' (SatBr, 7.5.1.9). In a cosmogonic myth (SatBr, 6.1.1.12) the life-sap (rasa) is identified with a tortoise. He (Praj?pati) desired: 'May I create this (earth) from the waters. He compressed this (earth which was in the embryonic form, or in the form of the egg-shell) and threw it into the waters. The juice (i.e., life-sap) which flowed from it became a tortoise; and that which was spurted upwards (became) what is produced above here over the waters. This whole (earth) dissolved itself all over the waters; all this (universe) appeared as one form only, viz. waters' (2). Again in SatBr (7.5.1.1) the tortoise is said to be the rasa (juice, i.e. life-sap) of these worlds, but in TaiS (5.2.8.5) the tortoise is said to be the medha 'life-sap' (see Dumont 1957: 17; also see Staal (ed.) 1983: 1.120 f.) (3) of the (domestic) animals. Because (!) SatBr, 15.15 : sa yat k?rmo n?ma / etad vai r?pam krtv? praj?patih praja asrjate jad asrjadakarot tad yad akarot tasm?t k?rmah kasyapo vai k?rmas tasm?d ?huh sarv?h praj?h k?syapa iti \\. Biardeau (1976: 18) thinks that the alleged etymological connection of k?rma with kr- 'to make, to do' is important (see Staal, ed., 1983: I 121). In the post-Vedic mythology this transformation of primordial purusa became the tortoise (k?rma) incarnation of Visnu. The germs or basis of this incarnation are found in this passage of SatBr. For the tortoise incarnation of Visnu, see the relevant section of this paper. (2) SatBr, 6.1.1.12: so'k?may?ta / ?bhyo'dbhyo'dhtm?m prajanayeyam iti t?m samklisy?psu pr?vidhyat tasya yah par?n raso'tyaksarat sa k?rmo'bhavad, atha yad ?rdhvam udauksyate'dam tad yad idam ?rdhvam adbhyo'dhi j?yate / seyam sarv?pa, ev?nuvyait tad idam ekam eva r?pam samadrsyat?pa eva //. Cf. RV, 10.129 (a cosmognoic hymn) which speaks about the evolution of truly existent cosmos (sat) from the undifferentiated chaos (asat). (3) TaiS, 5.2.85: medho v? es a pas?n?m yat k?rmah. Keith erroneously renders medha by 'intelligence'. Dumont (1957: 17) rightly renders it by 'life-sap'. Cf., e.g. TaiA, 1.25.2: k?rmam upadadh?ti I ap?meva medham avarundhe. S?yana here renders medha by s?ra. By seizing the domestic animals the sacrificer takes possession of this world, and by seizing the wild animals he takes possession of the yonder world. On tortoise, see Macdonell 1897: 151, 153; Gonda 1960: 102. 98 [2]</page><page sequence="3">of its shape the tortoise is regarded as a symbol of three worlds. The lower shell of it is this (terrestrial) world, the upper shell of it the yonder sky, and what is between (the shells) is the atmosphere (SatBr, 7.5.1.2). In V?jaS, 24.34 = MaiS, 3.14.15, the tortoise is said to belong to the heaven and earth (4) (cf. SatBr, 7.5.1.10 where it stands for heaven and earth). In Tai A (1.23.3) in a dialogue between the primordial Purusa and Praj?pati, the creator, it is said that this purusa appeared in the waters in the form of a tortoise out of the bones and flesh of Praj?pati (5). The sacrificial cake (purodasa) is said to have become a tortoise and started creeping about (TaiS, 2.6.3.3; cf. TaiS, 5.2.8.4; SatBr, 1.6.2.3). We also get some idea of totemism or the belief in the descent of the human race or of individual families or tribes from animals. Kasyapa 'Tortoise' is the name of a seer (RV, 9.114.2), but he figures in later Sathhit?s as a mythical character (see, e.g., AVS, 1.14.4; 2.33.7; 4.20.7; 8.5.14; V?jaS, 3.62, etc.). InAVS (19.53.10 = AVP, 12.2.10) Kasyapa is identical with the self-existent Praj?pati. In AitBr (8.21 ( = 39.7)) it is said that Visvakarman Bhauvana promised the earth to Kasyapa (cf. SatBr, 13.7.1.15; for Kasyapa, see Vedic Index, s.v.). According to PancBr (15.5.30) by means of the Ak?p?ra s?man the seer Ak?p?ra Kasyapa is said to have attained power and greatness. In JaimiBr (3.273; cf. 3.203) the name ak?p?ra is explained in a curious myth or legend. 'Ak?p?ra Kasyapa ("the tortoise Ak?p?ra") descended together with the Kalis into the ocean. He sought in it a firm-footing (pratisth?; on the term pratisthd, see Gonda 1975: 11.338-74). He saw the Ak?p?ra s?man and landed with it. Thereon he found a firm-footing in the ocean, viz. the earth. Thenceforth, the Kalis sit on his back. This Ak?p?ra s?man is a firm-footing. The The Chandoma(-days) are an ocean (because of a large number of stotriya-verses), and Kasyapa (the Tortoise) is able to convey (them) across the ocean. This Ak?p?ra s?man is for crossing over the ocean of the Chandoma-days'. (See, e.g., Keith 1970: 240; Caland's note on PancBr, 15.5.30). This tortoise Kasyapa, of limitless dimension, is nothing but a cosmic tortoise who finds this earth in the ocean (for various versions of cosmogony, see fn. 5). (4) V?jaS, 24.34: dyav?prthiviyah k?rmah (Uvata and Mahidhava: kurmah kacchapah dy?v?prthiviyah dy?v?prthwtdevatah); cf. SatBr; 7.5.1.10. (5) For various theories of creation, one may refer to Kuiper (1970: 98 ff.). According to one of the theories the earth was the result of a process of coagulation (cf., e.g., JamiBr, 3.360; Br?raU, 1.2.2, etc.). The second theory is that of mundane egg, which is either connected with the coagulation of the waters or the Creator. For various versions of this myth, see, e.g., SatBr, 11.1.6.1-2; JaimiBr, 3.360; JaimiUBr, 1.56.1; Ch?ndoU, 3.19.1, etc. The third theory tells us that a cosmogonic boar brought some mud upward from the bottom of the waters, which in the beginning became the beginning of the earth. This version of cosmogony is found in (black) YV texts (see, e.g., TaiS, 7.1.5.1; MaiS, 1.6.3; K?thS, 8.2; KapiKaS, 6.7; TaiBr, 1.2.1.3; Tai?, 10.1.8; ?paSS, 5.1.7, etc.). t3] 99</page><page sequence="4">2.2. Tortoise in the Post-Vedic Mythology In the post-Vedic mythology the tortoise appears to be the incarnation of divine being Visnu. Praj?pati is replaced by Visnu in the post-Vedic cosmogonic myth of the churning of the world ocean, the churning staff or axis of the world rests on tortoise. The story of the churning of the ocean is available in a number of versions in Mah?Bh?, R?m?, and many Pur?nas. It is believed that the gods churned the ocean of milk for the sake of amrta (nectar) with the help of the daityas or asuras. Visnu took the form of a tortoise (k?rma) and supported on its back mountain Mandara which served as a churning-stick. The serpent V?suki they used as churning-rope, the mountain as the churning-staff. Then Sri was born who was immediately claimed by Visnu. Even in Mah?Bh? (1.16) the Tortoise is not an avat?ra, but in R?m? (1.44.17) it becomes an avat?ra of Visnu. The Kasyapa (Tortoise) as creative power may once have been the tortoise as earth-power (cf. SatBr, 7.5.1.5) upholding Mandara (Mah?Bh?, 1.16.10-12), later (cf. VisnuP, 1.9.84) interpreted, k?matham r?pam, as a form of Visnu {R?m?, 1.44.17). Visnu is not only preserver but also destroyer (Mah?Bh?, 3.187.41; K?rmaP, 1.1.96; 1.16.30, etc., see Pai 1975: 102). As Avat?ra he saves; as wakener and maker, he creates; as Rudra, death etc., he destroys (see Hopkins 1915: 207, sec. 146). In Mah?Bh?, 12.851* we have a list of the Avat?ras: Harhsa, K?rma, Matsya, Var?ha, Narasirhha, V?mana, two R?mas, Krsna, and Kalki (cf. SkandP, 5(3).151.4 which has Buddha for Harhsa; and Mah?Bh?, 16.4.13 also mentions Sesa). The legend of K?rma-Avat?ra is available in many versions. It is not possible in this paper to give the typological classification of the myth (see e.g. Mah?Bh?, 1.15-17; R?m?, 1.44; HariVam, 3.30; VisnuDhaP, 1.40.10-20; Brahm?ndP, 1.25; K?rmaP, 1.1.27-31; Bh?gP, 8.5.15-8.12.47, etc.). This myth is found in Puranic texts belonging to Vaisnava and Saiva systems. For a detailed study of the myth one may refer to R?ping (1970), Coomaraswamy (1913: 314-16), Dange (1987: 893 ff.). 2.3. Tortoise in the Modern Indian Religious Beliefs and Folklore In India the tortoise is worshipped as a totem, or is sometimes supposed to save from calamities. In North India the K?cchis and Kacchawaha Rajputs allege that they take their names from the Kacchapa or tortoise, similarly Kurmis also refer their name of k?rma (see Crooke 1896: 2.149). The tortoise is a totem of the Mundari Kols. The Kharwars and Manjhis of Mirzapur worship clay images of tortoise. The Gondas believe that their ancestor Lingo was saved by the tortoise from the clutches of the alligator. In Kath?SaS?g (12.15A ff.) there is a story where the sons bring a tortoise for the sacrifice of their father, so that he can be saved from going to hell, etc. For such totemic beliefs connected with animals one may refer to ERE, 1.483-535; Cook, ERE, 10.667; Crooke 1896 and 1926, chapters on Animal worship). According to Chatterji (1945: 79) many images of Dharma in Bengal are just a figure of a tortoise. 100 [4]</page><page sequence="5">The word dharma is a Sanskritized form of the Austric *durom, duram, *daram, darom 'tortoise', cf. Bengali dur? or duro (p. 79). 2.4. Myths and Beliefs Connected with the Tortoise or Turtle in the World In various cultures there is a widespread belief that the earth rests on the back of a turtle or tortoise. Many creation myths in the world are connected with the tortoise or turtle. Among North American Indians many myths are prevalent which have reference to the turtle. According to the Maidu in California, a turtle dived to the bottom of the primeval ocean and produced a little soil under its nails. God made a ball of the soil, which then grew miraculously until it became as large as the universe itself. In the Onodaga and Iroquois (i.e., Mohawk) myth the world was at first covered with water, and when Aataetsic fell from heaven, the animals in a conference decided to bring the earth, the turtle brought the soil on his back, and then the miraculous growth of the earth took place. The turtle is an important Iroquois totem; the clan traces its descent from a turtle that threw off its shell. According to the Buriats, in the beginning there was nothing but water and a turtle. God turned the turtle on its back and built the world on its stomach. In other versions Mandishire (the bodhisattva Manjusri) transforms himself into a great turtle and supports the earth he has made on the surface of the waters (Waida in Eliade, ed., 1987: 15.96-7). In China the turtle symbolizes the universe (sky and earth). From prehistoric times we find 'stone' turtles in South Korea and southern Japan (Kyushu) on the seashore facing the Korean peninsula. People believed that the turtle bestows immortality on the dead and escorts them across the sea to paradise under waters (Waida, ibid.: 97). In Zoroastrianism, the tortoise was an evil creature, and consequently was to be killed (Vendtddd, 14.5). Many taboos are also connected with turtle or tortoise. Kwapas were not allowed to lift a small water-tortoise by its tail, lest there should be a flood (ERE, 1.530). The turtle was sacrificed in Pomotu. The Zunis have the turtle as one of their totem. Turtle-fishing is full of many tabus in Madagascar ? the fisher had to eat the turtle on the shore, and shell had to be left there too. In the islands of Towes turtle dances were performed to ensure success in the fishing. Thus many beliefs are connected in the world with the turtle or tortoise. The Balinese temple called 'Meru' stands on the basement of a big tortoise (see Vogel 1926: 284). 3.0. Tortoise in the Vedic Ritual Every big or small act promised the sacrifice riches in cattle and offspring, long life and bliss in the other world. Thereby, it is that even the animals, inanimate objects and beings, sacrificial implements and vessels, etc., are employed very meticulously and even without the slightest negligence in the Vedic rites and they are held in high [5] 101</page><page sequence="6">esteem. Tortoise is a reptile par excellence which is employed in or associated with many Vedic rites. 3.1. Tortoise in the Full- and New-moon Sacrifices In the case of the baking of the sacrificial cakes, the Adhvaryu should give (that ball) the shape of a tortoise while it is being flattened {BaudhSS, 1.9). He (the Adhvaryu) should make (each of the cakes) neither thick nor of the size of an ap?na; he should make it resembling the form of a tortoise and of the measurement of a horse's hoof (?paSS, 1.25A = BhdrSS, 1.26.2; cf. M?nSS, 1.2.3.22). (On the baking of the sacrificial cake, see Srautakosa [Eng. Sec] I.i.285-90). 3.2. Tortoise in the Purhsavana Rite In the Purhsavana rite he (the husband) puts gall of a tortoise (k?rmapitta) (6) on her (wife's) lap (PdrGS, 1.14.5). If he desires 'May (the son) become valiant', he recites over him (i.e. over the embryo) modifying the rite (?), 'Thou art, Suparna' (V?jaS, 12.4). 3.3. Tortoise in the Asvamedha In the horse sacrifice a number of animals are enumerated which are tied to the sacrificial posts and in the intermediate spaces, with the names of deities or deified entities to which they are dedicated. In this rite there seems to be some sort of exaggeration in the number of victims which goes even up to 609 or more. Sometimes even impossible animals are also mentioned, 'but it must be remembered that the Asvamedha was a most important tribal solemnity of rare occurrence and that no effort would be spared to assume its performance with all possible splendour'. (Griffith, YV(Tr.), p. 258, fn. 1; cf. Keith 1970: 344-45). In V?jaS (24.34 = (K.) 26.7.4 =MaiS, 3.14.15) the tortoise is one of the animals tied to the sacrificial posts, and it has close association with the deities Heaven and Earth (dy?v?prthivi). It is perhaps chosen because of its shape which resembles these two worlds, viz. heaven and earth. The oblation is made (in this rite) of the roasted flesh, the various parts of the victim being assigned with the call sv?h? to a host of deities and other objects which are regarded as deified for the occasion. The hooves (6) The expression k?rmapittam is understood by one of the commentators as 'dish with water' (see Karka: k?rmapittasabdenodakasar?vam ucyate). MW, 'a vessel with water'. I follow here Oldenberg, see his footnote on this s?tra in SBE, 29.292. The tortoise is able to exert fertilizing influences (cf. Gonda 1969: 127). Tortoise is associated with a number of totems of sexual nature. 102 [6]</page><page sequence="7">of the victims are offered to the (deities) tortoises with the formula: k?rm?n chaphaih (prin?mi) '(I gratify) tortoises with the hooves' (TaiS, 5.7.13 = MaiS, 3.15.3 = K?thS, 5.13.3 = V?jaS, 25.3 = (K.) 27.3.1). In TaiS (5.5.17.1) the enumeration of the victims to be tied to the sacrificial posts goes on, here the tortoise is offered to the months (cf. V?jaS, 24.37; (K.) 26.8.2; MaiS, 3.14.8; K?thS, 5.7.7) (7). Association of the tortoise with the months reminds one of the time which at the beginning generated Prajapati, the self-existent {AVS, 19.53.10). 3.4. Tortoise in the Animal Sacrifice In the animal sacrifice the parts of the victim are cut off in such a manner as to make either some animals or some other objects. In AitBr (2.6 = 6.6) detailed account is given like this: 'Make its (victim's) breast an eagle, its two front legs hatchets, its two fore feet spikes, its shoulders two tortoises, as it were, its loins uncut, its thighs two door leaves, its knees oleander leaves; its ribs are twenty-six' (8) (cf. MaiS, 4.13.4; K?thS, 16.21; TaiBr, 3.6.6.3; S?nkh?SS, 5.17.5; M?nSS, 5.2.9.4). In AsvSS (1.3.3.1) it is described (under the hautra relating to offering of the Omentum) as the adhrigu-ceH which is recited by the hotr, viz. daivy?h samit?ra ?rabhadhvam Uta manusy? upanayata, etc. (see Srautakosa, I.ii.830). In M?nSS (5.2.9.4) it is described as modifications of words at the animal sacrifice. As a matter of rule for the limbs of the two or more animals the plural is used (instead of dual, see M?nSS, 5.2.9A). 3.5. Tortoise in the Agnicayana Rite The piling up of the fire-altar is one of the most important and elaborate ceremonies of the Vedic rite (9). This rite is performed along with a Soma-sacrifice, but it is (7) TaiS, 5.5.17.1 reads, anyav?poWdham?s?n?m m?s?th kasyapah [...], whereas V?jaS, 24.37 reads, anyav?poWdham?s?n?m rsyo may?rah suparnas te gandharv?n?m udro m?s?m kasyapo rohit pundm?ct golattik? te'psaras?m mrtyave'sitah //. Griffith, The cuckoo belongs to the Half Months; antelope, peacock, eagle, these are the Gandharvas; the other belongs to the Months; tortoise, doe-antelope, iguana, Golattik? belong to the Apsarases; the black snake belongs to the death'. Really speaking the correct rendering of ap?m udro m?s?m kasyapah should be 'the otter belongs to the waters, the tortoise to the months'; see Uvata and Mahidhava: kasyapah kacchapah m?s?n?m. (8) AitBr, 2.6 (= 6.6) syenam asya vaksah kmut?t prasas? h?h? sal? dosani kasyapev?msacchidre sroni kavasor? skrekaparn?sthwant? sadvimsatir asya vankrayah /.

(9) For an elaborate account of the Agnicayana, one may refer to Weber, IndSt, 13.217-92; Eggeling, SBE, 41. xxvi-xxvii, 143 ff.; SBE, 43.xiii-xxvii and translation and notes on K?ndas 8 to 10 of this volume; HDS, Il.ii. 1246-55; Keith (1970: 354-56); TaiS (transl.) cxxv-cxxxi; Dumont (1951: 629-75); Staal, ed. (1983). t7] 103</page><page sequence="8">obligatory in certain cases. At the bottom of this rite lie certain cosmogonic or aetiological theories. 3.5.1. In the Agnicayana rite a tortoise is also immured or buried alive in the fire altar. According to M?nSS (3.6.16) 'If he cannot find a tortoise (for the piling up of the fire-altar) he should place a crab (karka), if he cannot find it, he shall bake a purod?sa in the shape of a tortoise and place particles of gold used as elevation (hiranyaprda), gold on both sides according to some on it\ 3.5.2. The Building up of the Ahavantya Fire-Altar (the First Layer) He (the adhvaryu) lays down a lotus-leaf (in the centre of altar-site where the horse planted its hoof) (TaiS, 5.2.6.5; SatBr, 7.4.1.7 ff.; ?paSS, 16.22.3); and on that lotus-leaf the golden disc, worn by the sacrificer at the time of the Visnu strides during the initiation period, is placed (see SatBr, 6.7.1.1 ff.) with the mantra brahma jajn?nam (V?jaS, 13.3; TaiS, 4.2.8.2). He puts down a golden (image of) man to the south of that golden disc with his head to the east and face turned to the sky, and he does not cover the entire golden disc, with the mantra 'in the beginning the Hiranyagarbha came into existence' (V?jaS, 13A = RV, 10.121.1; cf. SatBr, 7.4.1.19; TaiS, 5.2.7.2, etc.). With the sarpan?ma formulas (V?jaS, 13.6-8; TaiS, 4.2.8.3) the sacrificer pays homage to the serpents (see SatBr, 1AA.26 ff.; IndSt, 13.249). By the side of the two arms of the golden man the adhvaryu places two srucs, one of k?rsmarya filled with ghee on the right (i.e. south) side, and the other of udumbara filled with curds on the left (i.e. north) side with their tops to the east (TaiS, 5.2.7.2-3; SatBr, 7.4.1.36-8). The k?rsmarya one he lays down with (V?jaS, 13.13) and the udumbara one with (V?jaS, 13.14). The sacrificer puts down the naturally perforated brick (svyam?trnn?, i.e. the earth) (10) on the golden man (TaiS, 5.2.8.1; SatBr, 1 A.2.1-5). Symbolically it represents the vital air. Then the adhvaryu lays down the d?rv?-bnck (TaiS, 5.2.8.2; SatBr, 7.4.2.10 ff.). That is to say, a stalk of d?rv? grass is laid upon the first naturally perforated brick in such a way that the root lies upon it and the tops hanging down to the ground (for details see Eggeling, SBE, 41.187, fn. 3; IndSt, 13.249 f.). He lays down the dviyajus-brick (to the east of d?rv?) with (V?jaS, 13.22-3; see SatBr, 7.4.2.16 ff.), two retahsic-bncks to the east of the dviyajus with (V?jaS, 13.24; see SatBr, 1 A.2.22 ff.); he lays down the visvajyotis-bnck between the two retahsic bncks (n) with (V?jaS, 13.24; see SatBr, 7.4.2.25 ff.), then he places two rtavy? bricks with (V?jaS, 13.25; see SatBr, 7.4.2.29 ff.), then as as?dh?-bnck with (V?jaS, (10) The three svayam?trnn?s in the centre of the first, third, and fifth layers represent the three worlds, viz. the earth, atmosphere and heaven (SatBr, 9.5.1.58).

Immuring the Living Tortoise An aratni to the south of the as?dh?-brick and to the east of the svyam?trnn? brick (the adhvaryu, acting for the sacrificer) places a living tortoise with its face towards the golden man (i.e., to the east) on the avak? (moss-like) plants (K?tySS, 17.4.28; cf. ?paSS, 16.25.1; SatBr, 7.5.1.1 ff.; TaiS, 5.2.8.5; K?thS, 20.7 = KapiKaS, 31.9) (12). The avak? plants are like a tortoise [K?tySS, 17.9.6). In that the heads of the dead animals are deposited, a burial ground is made; in that he puts down a living tortoise, (thereby) he happens to be a non-maker of the burial ground (asmas?nacit), the tortoise is fit for dwelling (TaiS, 5.2.8.5; cf. MaiS, 3.2.7). The tortoise (which is said to represent the Sun or Praj?pati) is anointed with a mixture of ghee, honey, and curds with the mantras (V?jaS, 13.27-9), and is enveloped in moss covered with a net and made motionless by means of pegs (TaiS, 5.2.8.6; SatBr, 7.5.1.4; ?paSS, 17.25.2; HirSS, 11.7.41). He puts it down with three mantras (V?jaS, 13.30-2), which express the wish that the tortoise may go to the deep waters; that the sun and fire may not torment it by heat, that it may reach heavenly worlds, and that divine rain may follow (SatBr, 7.5.1.8, ?paSS, 16.25.2; HirSS, 11.7.42; K?tySS, 17.4.27; see IndSt, 13.250 f.). The adhvaryu then makes it move with (V?jaS, 13.31). In fact, he sets the tortoise down with three mantras', while muttering the second mantra he makes it move while he still holds it in his hand (SatBr, 7.5.1.9). He then puts mortar and pestle of udumbara wood about one aratni north of the svyam?trnn?-brick. 3.5 A. The Mystery of the Fire-Altar (Number of Bricks in Layers, etc.) According to SatBr (10.4.3.14) the first layer (of the altar) consists of ninety-eight (items). The adhvaryu lays down the yajusmatt-bricks (with certain formulas), grass bunch, the four-clod bricks, the lotus-leaf, the gold plate and man, the two offering spoons, naturally perforated brick, the d?rv?-brick, a dviyajus-bricks, two retahsic-bricks, a visvajyotis-brick, two rtavy ?-bricks, an as?dh?-brick, a tortoise, mortar and pestle, (12) On various mythological beliefs connected with tortoise, see section 2 of this paper. The custom of placing living animals, sometimes even human beings, under the foundations of a house or of a bridge etc. to secure its stability is of very great antiquity and formerly widespread (see Griffith's note on V?jaS, 13.30). Keith (1970: 355, fn. 1) remarks The practice may clearly be connected with the recorded discovery of toads living inside rocks, etc.'. I do not agree with it. The tortoise is chosen because of its fertilizing influence, and due to its association with the creation myth, and due to its shape resembling the universe. [9] 105</page><page sequence="10">fire-pan, the five victims' heads, fifteen apasy ?-bricksy five chandasy ?-bricks, fifty pr?nabhrt-bricks. In a dialogue between Kusri Vajasravasa, Susravas and others, the significance of putting certain objects in certain directions or positions is indicated (see SatBr, 10.5.5.7 and 10.5.5.10, etc.). 3.5.5. According to BaudhSuS (9.1), one who is desirous of conquering the world of Brahman, he should construct the fire-altar in the shape of a tortoise, this is the accepted tradition. The tortoises are said to be of two types, viz. those with angular limbs (vakr?ngas), and those round ones (parimandalas), the same are the limbs of the fire altar [BaudhSuS, 9.2). No part of the tortoise should be eaten, other aquatic beings like fish etc. should also not be eaten. Thus, one who knowing this piles up this ?runaketaka fire, for him the waters and the water-animals become harmless (TaiA, 1.26.7). This appears to be a root of totemic belief, and the tortoise is held in high esteem. 4.0. Resume From the foregoing discussion we are led to the following considerations argumenti causa: i. In mythology and ritual the tortoise holds high and divine position, and possesses supernatural powers. Praj?pati, assuming the form of a tortoise, created the universe and also other creatures. ii. The tortoise becomes incarnation of a divine being Visnu in the post-Vedic mythology. iii. The cosmogonic myth in many religions and beliefs in the world is closely associated with the tortoise. iv. In the Vedic rituals the tortoise plays a significant role. In the Agnicayana it is immured alive in the altar. In the Asvamedha rite the tortoise is one of the animals tied to the sacrificial posts, and it belongs to Heaven and Earth. In sum, the tortoise is a reptile par excellence.
