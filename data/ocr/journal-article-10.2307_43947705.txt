<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michelangelo in Love: Decoding the Children's Bacchanal Mary D. Garrard In 1532-33, Michelangelo created a group of drawings as gifts for Tommaso de' Cavalieri, the young Roman nobleman he had met in the summer of 1532 and with whom he had fallen in love. The gift drawings included the Cleopatra now in Casa Buonarroti, Florence, a Rape of Ganymede, and three drawings at Windsor Castle: The Fall of Phaeton (known also in two other versions), the Punishment ofTityus , and the so-called Children's Bacchanal (Fig. 1). Two more related drawings at Windsor, Il sogno and the Three Labors of Hercules, may also have been given to Cavalieri, but their origins are less clear.1 Two of the gift drawings, the Ganymede and Tityus , are pre- sumed to be those delivered to Cavalieri at the end of 1532 and acknowledged by the recipient in his first letter to the artist, on New Year's Day, 1533 (Fig. 2). 2 They allude meta- phorically but openly to tńe artist's passion for the handsome young patrician, which Michelangelo also professed in son- nets. The Fogg Ganymede (either a first version or a copy of the lost drawing owned by Cavalieri) shows the young shep- herd swooning in the grip of a rising Jovian eagle.3 It has been connected with the first love sonnet the artist addressed to Cavalieri in August 1532, which reads in part: "s' un 'anima in duo corpi e fatta etterna, / ambo levando al cielo e con pari ale. . . ." (If one soul in two bodies is made eternal, rais- ing both to heaven with similar wings. . . .).4 In the Tityus drawing, Jupiter's soaring eagle has become a vulture peck- ing at Tityus's liver, now inflicting punishment rather than pleasure. Together, the two drawings have been taken to rep- resent the rapture and torture of love.5 The Tityus drawing, like Michelangelo's sculptural Victory (Fig. 25), has been linked with another sonnet he wrote for Cavalieri, which speaks of pain, conquest, and bondage and ends with a direct allusion to his beloved's name: "resto prigion d'un cavalier armato" (I remain the prisoner of an armed cavalier).6 Michelangelo's decision to voice his passion through myth- ological themes was a logical choice, since Cavalieri was not only a fledgling artist but also an admirer and later collector of antique art. According to Giorgio Vasari, Michelangelo drew a life-size portrait of his young friend, in which Tom- maso was dressed in classical attire, holding a medal or por- trait.7 Beyond that, however, their shared humanistic knowledge of classical art and myth afforded Michelangelo and Cavalieri a metaphoric vocabulary for coded private expression. Profoundly ambivalent about his passion for young male beauty, Michelangelo defensively denied rumors of his homosexuality yet maintained a consistently ambigu- ous positioning for both his friends and public. The love son- nets and gift drawings could be understood equally within the conventions of Petrarchan courtly love that shaped Michelangelo's earliest poetry, and within the Florentine Neoplatonist concept of Socratic love, which followed the ancient Greek ideal to celebrate love between older and younger men (in 1532, Michelangelo was fifty-seven; Tommaso was twenty-one or younger).8 Like Giovanni Pico della Mirandola and Agnolo Poliziano before him, Michelan- gelo could simultaneously express his passion in explicitly physical terms and insist on its purely spiritual nature.9 To some extent, Michelangelo's publicizing of his love for Cavalieri was a form of self-protection, since cloaking the poetry and drawings within the mantle of Neoplatonist and Petrarchan models provided a cover for the riskier covert meaning.10 Well aware of the discrepancy between his desires and the moral/legal constraints of society, Michelangelo surely used ambiguity as a hedge against too overt interpreta- tion. At the same time, he could also enjoy the playful coding of meaning within classical themes, not so much to conceal as to thematize the homosexual message, addressed to an esoteric audience that included both his love object and other men in the know.11 As Maria Ruvoldt has pointed out, Michelangelo's love for Cavalieri was an "open secret," pro- tected by intermediaries who carried letters back and forth between them, but advertised by both the artist and his friends to a wider private circle.12 The drawings' very ambiguity - their simultaneous nature as both secret and public and their consistent functioning on two planes of meaning - was what gave them their frisson. The structural scaffold of double meaning in the drawings and sonnets - "I'm saying this, but it might be that" - served as a form of semiotic play, certainly for Michelangelo and perhaps for Tommaso. Michelangelo ended the letter that accompanied his first gift drawings with an enigmatic sen- tence: "It is usual for a donor to name the things he gives to the recipient, but for reasons of propriety, it will not be done here," teasing his new beloved with a hint of passions that could not be expressed openly.13 In one of the earliest son- nets addressed to Cavalieri, Michelangelo repeats the word "know" suggestively, implying an intimacy the two men already shared: 'You know that I know, my lord, that you know / that I come closer to take delight in you, / and you know I know you knowjust who I am."14 There are hints that they would have preferred to keep their relationship private, as in Tommaso's comment to Michelangelo that "I tried hard to save the Ganymede ," when Cardinal Ippolito de' Medici borrowed some of the gift draw- ings to be copied in rock crystal.15 Yet there was little hope for this possibility when the very drawings in question per- formed a striptease of meaning for knowing audiences. When Sebastiano del Piombo recommended to Michelan- gelo that he turn his Ganymede drawing into a Saint John of the Apocalypse by adding a halo, he proposed a camouflage that implied an insider's knowledge.16 The point for their friends, it would seem, was not to determine whether Michel- angelo's love for Tommaso de' Cavalieri did or did not have a sexual dimension, nor even whether the emotions he expressed were "real." It was to keep the story in play and contribute to the hermeneutic game.</page><page sequence="2">MICHELANGELO IN LOVE: DECODING THE CHILDREN'S BACCHANAL 25 1 Michelangelo Buonarroti, Children' s Bacchanal, 1533, red chalk, 103/4 x 15I4 in. (27.4 x 38.8 cm). Royal Collection, Windsor Castle, inv. no. RL 12777 (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Royal Collection Trust, © Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2013) The double meanings of the Ganymede and Tityus drawings were fairly obvious and easily accessible to an audience who recognized the personal application of these narrative themes. Other drawings in the Cavalieri group - the Chil- dren's Bacchanal , The Archers , and the Sogno (Fig. 10) - are more cryptic, and these have continued to baffle scholars even on the level of primary meaning. Since none of the three represents a known narrative, efforts to interpret them have led to allegorical readings, quite extensive in the case of The Archers and the Sogno.17 The Children's Bacchanal , the last of the four named by Vasari, has received much less attention than the other gift drawings and has resisted even allegorical interpretation. Michelangelo's friends could joke about his "Ganymedes," but the Bacchanal flew under the radar, even in its time. A new reading suggests that the Children 's Bacchanal shared with the Ganymede and Tityus a specific relevance to the Michelangelo-Cavalieri relationship, but one more deeply coded. Like the Sogno , which it matches in iconographie com- plexity and self-quotation, the Bacchanal may refer discur- sively to the relation between the artist's passion for his love object and his own artistic creativity. Cavalieri 's physical beauty awakened in Michelangelo not only love but also newly inspired creativity, leading him to freshly inventive ways of representing his passion and of figuring beauty. In this sense, the Ganymede and Tityus can be understood not as barely metaphoric representations of an artist elevated and ravaged by love but, rather, as extravagant images of surren- der and torture inventively married to the artist's passion for his young friend, their very excess an expressive equivalent of his teeming artistic imagination. In all the gift drawings, I propose, Michelangelo presents to the beautiful beloved, in a reciprocal spirit, the creative fruits of an artist transformed by love, whose metamorphosis has generated new images and an expanding visual vocabu- lary. Because Tommaso gave him "the food on which he lives," as the artist put it in a letter,18 Michelangelo gives Tommaso the visible manifestation of his renewed creativity. The Children's Bacchanal The Children 's Bacchanal, probably the last created of the Ca- valieri drawings, is the most highly finished and formally sub- tle of the group.19 Five groups of figures, mostly nude putti, are drawn in equally firm detail and sculptural modeling, as if in relief, and distributed laterally across three tiers of a rocky setting. The effect of high finish is offset by the grainy surface and overall granular texture, as if the figures were seen through a fine mist.20 The Bacchanal! s exceptional deli- cacy of touch was noted by Vasari, who avowed: "with the lightness of breath you could not have achieved greater</page><page sequence="3">26 ART bulletin march 2014 VOLUME xcvi number 1 2 Michelangelo or after Michelangelo, The Rape of Ganymede, 1532, black chalk, 14V4 x 105/s in.

Despite its qualitative fineness, the Bacchanal has attracted few admirers. Erwin Panofsky found the drawing gloomy and dismal; Baruch Kirschenbaum considered it morally depraved ("Michelangelo has taken exalted motifs and used them to depict a base semi-human orgy"); and Herbert von Einem pronounced, "There is little joy in this representation of revelry."22 In Michael Hirst's description, "Torpor, melan- choly, a drunken sleep, and death dominate ... in a setting deprived of sun and sky."23 Nearly everyone has been puzzled by its strange combination of images. As the exasperated Frederick Hartt complained, "no text has yet been produced to solve the enigma of the subject."24 Indeed, no known nar- rative theme could explain this ensemble of thirty children, a sleeping man, a nursing satyress, an upturned deer, a boiling pot, and a child-packed wine vat. If the Bacchanal holds an allegorical message, it is in the consensus of scholars a dys- topic one, since its bacchanalian imagery radiates neither pagan exuberance nor sensual pleasure. But if the Bacchanal has no recognizable narrative subject, it does have a generic context. The episode at top right, of chil- dren playing around a wine vat (Fig. 26), simultaneously 3 Donatello, Judith Slaying Holofernes, ca. 1457-60, detail of the relief on the base showing spirìtelli treading grapes, bronze, 17V4 x 22V£in.

Palazzo Vecchio, Florence (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Alinari, provided by Art Resource, NY) recalls Andrea Mantegna's engraving Bacchanal with a Wine Vat of about 1475, an illustration in Francesco Colonna's Hypnero- tomachia PoliphiĶ and the reliefs on the base of Donatello's Judith Slaying Holofernes , of about 1457-60 (Fig. 3). 25 These artists allude to the genre of Bacchic reliefs on Roman sar- cophagi, which show putti and satyrs crushing grapes in vats and drunken entourages proceeding toward sacrifice. A Bac- chic sarcophagus in Pisa in which putti play around wine jars, one diving in and another urinating, was Donatello's probable source, and perhaps Michelangelo's as well (Fig. 4).26 Renaissance Bacchic imagery, as in antiquity, stood broadly for erotic sensuality, nature's seasonal cycles, mortality, and, sometimes, spiritual depravity, luxury, or excess. But, as Charles Dempsey explains, Donatello's putti are more pre- cisely spiritelli, the diminutive form of spiritus , the "breath of life animating the human organism," whose movements rep- resent both love and the life force, an amoral, or premoral, figure for "those uncontrollable sensations" that "arise in the body unbidden," induced by fright, music, drinking, sexual arousal, or suddenly falling in love. The fully active spiritello was invented by Donatello and proliferated in Renaissance imagery thereafter.27 In the Children's Bacchanal , Michelangelo's expressive homage to Donatello is clear, but he also drew on antique reliefs directly, incorporating details not found in quattro- cento precedents and connecting them in ways not implied in the antique models. For example, the drawing's central motif of children carrying a supine hoofed animal combines two images: one, on a much-copied sarcophagus that stood near S. Maria Maggiore, Rome, of putti carrying a drunken Pan, and a sarcophagus fragment with a satyr shouldering an overturned small animal, whose flailing legs are echoed in Michelangelo's upended deer (Fig. 5). 28 Each of the five epi- sodes in the Bacchanal is grounded in antique Bacchic imag- ery: the nursing satyress echoes a nursing maenad on the second-century CE Torlonia Vase, while a Hellenistic puteal, or well head, in the Vatican presents a model for the sacrifice</page><page sequence="4">MICHELANGELO IN LOVE: DECODING THE CHILDREN'S BACCHANAL 27 4 Roman sarcophagus, detail showing spińtelli playing around a wine jar, 2nd century CE, marble, 18 x 59 in.

At the same time, each group also resonates with modern references: the central group of spiritelli carrying the deer to sacrifice is, mutatis mutandis, a near quotation of Raphael's Borghese Entombment of Christ , a point that underlines the theme of sacrifice while impl^ng a Christ-like identity for the deer (Fig. 8). 30 The boys conducting the pig sacrifice recapit- ulate gestures and poses seen in the Sacrifice of Noah in the Sistine Ceiling, particularly the faggot bearer (in reverse), while the sleeping man recalls both the drunken Noah in the final history and Adam in the Creation of Eve.31 Indeed, if one thinks of the drawing as a fantasia on Sistina themes, the spiritelli look like liberated versions of the paired putti who flank the prophets and sibyls, released from architectural confinement to operate as free spirits. Considered in the dual contexts of antique Bacchic sar- cophagi and Michelangelo's own visual vocabulary, the spiri- telli of the Bacchanal project an expressive tone not of gloom and depravity, but of antic liberation. Like Donatello, Michel- angelo invests his spiritelli with an animated frenzy that matches them to their function to represent the sensations that "arise in the body unbidden." Children are naturally libidinous and amoral, and their wild and reckless behavior can be frightening. Yet these children are engaged in deadly serious play, whose importance is signaled by their physical exertions and determined expressions. Michelangelo's irre- sponsible spiritelli are playing with fire, intent on secret experiments whose purposes and outcomes are far from clear. As the dominant actors of the Windsor drawing, they transport us to a perilous fantasy realm, where anything might happen and there are no rules. Equally unclear is the relation of these rebellious activities to the somber groups below. In contrast to the vigorous ener- gies of the high-spirited children, a seemingly miserable satyress sits wedged in the cavernous shadow of a rock, nurs- ing a child from a withered breast. On the right, a nude man slumps, overcome by sleep or drink. Do these icons of abjec- tion provide a moral perspective on the wine-fueled misbe- havior of the children, signifying the dangers that lie beyond the tipping point of excessive drink? Both earlier and con- temporary writers have thought so. One scholar recently</page><page sequence="5">28 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 1 7 Hellenistic puteal, Drunken Dionysos Supported by Satyrs. Vatican Museums, Vatican City (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Alinari, provided by Art Resource, NY) concluded that the putti in the Bacchanal "symbolize how man, whose reason has become stultified and who has become enslaved by the senses, ends life in a sleep 'constantly plagued by dreams.'"32 And entries on this drawing in both the Royal Collection online catalog and a recent exhibition catalog sin- gle out elements in the composition that point to man's ani- mal nature and the destructive effects of drinking wine to suggest that the drawing may have been intended "to warn the young Tommaso not to drink excessively."33 An alternative perspective on the effects of drink has a lon- ger history. When Pico della Mirandola named Bacchus, and not Apollo, as the leader of the Muses, he drew on Plato's idea of divine poetic furor to imply a connection between Bac- chic ecstasy and creative inspiration.34 Marsilio Ficino's the- ory of divine inspiration as an ecstatic frenzy, or madness, amplified Plato's model for quattrocento Florentines.35 Similarly, Girolamo Savonarola, echoing Saint Ambrose, explained the union of the soul with God through metaphors that celebrated the sanctifying "drunkenness" of the Eucha- ristie wine.36 So pervasive was the metaphor linking drink with spiritual inspiration that, as Ruvoldt has shown, a Renais- sance image of the philosopher Diogenes was formally com- posed to resemble Michelangelo's drunken Noah in the Sistine Ceiling, to evoke an association that strengthens his image as inspired philosopher.37 The paradox that drink can be both uplifting and debilitating was captured in the ancients' idea of Bacchus as uniquely able to discriminate between intoxication and inebriation. Within Renaissance thought, this two-edged nature of drinking recalls that of melancholy, whose doubleness represented, in Ruvoldt' s words, "the peculiar mix of benefits and afflictions that made the humor both desirable and suspect."38 The literature on both subjects makes clear that Renaissance Italians appreci- ated the paradox. This very paradox complicates our efforts to interpret the Bacchanal s meaning. A Platonic madness may drive the 8 Raphael, The Entombment of Chrìst , 1507, oil on panel, 72V£ X 69V4 in.

Must we choose, privileging one meaning of intoxication as dominant? Or does Michelangelo's expressive differentiation of the groups establish the paradox itself as the theme, whose variations are elaborated within a quasi- narrative framework? Reading in Dream Logic One drawing survives to tell us how this composition began. A chalk sketch in the Musée Bonnat, Bayonne, the apparent point of departure for the Bacchanal, 39 includes just two of the elements: the sleeping man and the boys in the wine vat (Fig. 9). The man in the left foreground, who reclines in the pose of a river god,40 is drawn more firmly than the hazy, tumbling, merging putti, who weave in and out as if faintly remembered or dreamed by the reclining protagonist, distin- guished from them by size, formal density, and physical maturity. The boys who play in and around a staved vat and a boy who sleeps at lower right set the theme of wine pressing and drinking, an activity in which the sleeper may or may not have partaken.41 The Bayonne sketch contains the two elements that are seemingly in greatest opposition in the finished drawing - the exuberant boys in the wine vat and the drunken or sleep- ing man - and in both images, their relation is ambiguous. In the Bayonne study, the outlines of the man's body are given in both black and red chalk versions, and it is not estab- lished whether he is turning to look at the boys, turning away from them, or slumping in a stupor. The boys' actions are barely hinted, yet dedicated: one climbs into the tub; two others pass a vessel that resembles an archaic Greek krater;</page><page sequence="6">MICHELANGELO IN LOVE: DECODING THE CHILDREN'S BACCHANAL £9 9 Michelangelo, Reclining Male Nude with Nude Children , before 1533, red and black chalk, 8Vs x 12^8 in.

Vaquero, © Musée Bonnat-Helleu, Bayonne) and at the middle, a boy moves forward somewhat furtively, carrying a similar vessel toward or away from the slumped man. This provocative yet unexplained juxtaposition, with its hazy but specific features, suggests that the idea for this bac- chanal might have originated in a dream, which Michelan- gelo set down in a sketch, then later developed. Dreaming is pertinent here. Ruvoldt has effectively articu- lated the connection between dreams and artistic creativity in the Renaissance, including Michelangelo's full knowledge of the associations that make up this nexus.42 Along with the concept of divine furor , Ficino also revived Plato's idea that true inspiration comes not to the rational mind but in moments of its suspension, whether in sleep or intoxication. In this state of vacatio , according to Ficino, "the more that the external movement ceases, the greater the interior activity."43 The dreams that ensue from the vacatio of sleep were, for many Renaissance writers and artists, specifically associated with creative activity. The Neapolitan humanist Giovanni Pontano identified dreams as a source of poetic invention. Pietro Bembo proclaimed to Lucrezia Borgia that three sonnets had come to him in a dream; and Albrecht Dürer complained that in his dreams he envisioned "great works of art and beautiful things" that never appeared to him when awake, and left him as soon as the dream faded.44 Michelangelo, a Saturnine melancholic who self-identified with night as the matrix of his artistic creativity,45 was also interested in dreams and their association with inspiration. He recounted his dreams and liked to interpret them and those of others.46 Sometimes this was tongue-in-cheek. In a letter to Luigi del Riccio, Michelangelo reports that in the previous night's dream, he encountered the beautiful Cec- chino Braci, "l'idolo nostro," who was laughing yet also seemed menacing. Not knowing which of the two aspects to believe, he asks Riccio to find out from the boy and resolve the ambiguity for him.47 An example cited by Ruvoldt dem- onstrates the close connection for Michelangelo between dreaming and the mind's work of creative invention. In a let- ter to Vasari, he explains that a design for the Laurentian Library came to him, as "a certain staircase appears in my mind, like a dream." As Ruvoldt observes, it is a description that "reveals the visionary quality of invention."48 Francisco de Hollanda quoted Michelangelo on the close interaction between the intellect and the image seen "with interior eyes," as the artist selects from those things "his imagination and prudence may attain, as an exemplar dreamt or seen in the sky or elsewhere."49 Perhaps the clearest indication of Michelangelo's absorp- tion in the relation between dreams and artistic creativity is II Sogno , or "The Dream," a drawing that is virtually a textbook illustration of the Renaissance link between artistic inspira- tion and melancholy (Fig. 10). 50 Since the seventeenth cen- tury, the Sogno' s beautiful male nude aroused by a trumpeting angel has been understood to represent the human soul awakened to virtue from vice, with the tradi- tional vices identified in the half-figure images who float around him.51 Michelangelo's own identification with the allegorical nude, as melancholic artistic genius receiving divine inspiration, has been secured by modern writers who have fleshed out iconographie references. Most recently, Ruvoldt maintained that the Sogno' s hero is in fact dreaming (there being pictorial traditions for open-eyed dreamers) sur- rounded by "dream visions" of his carnal temptations, whose insubstantial material form in the finished drawing connotes their existence solely in the artist's imagination.52 Ruvoldt' s analysis of the Sogno holds two important implica- tions for our consideration of the Bacchanal One is that their very different imagery involves a common theme, the relation between sexuality and artistic inspiration, a point to which I will later return. A second implication is that Michelangelo's interest in dreams tells us something about his creative pro- cess. In taking on Michelangelo's dream interpretations, Ruvoldt is careful to avoid modern psychoanalysis and to define the dreaming-creativity nexus in pre-Freudian terms, as "a rhetorical tool" of early modern artists and poets.53 It is important to establish that dreams were associated with crea- tivity before Sigmund Freud wrote on the subject, yet we need</page><page sequence="7">30 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 1 10 Michelangelo, Il sogno (The Dream), ca. 1533, black graphite on paper, 155/s x 11 in.

The Courtauld Gallery, London, Samuel Courtauld Trust, D.1978.PG.424 (artwork in the public domain; photograph © Samuel Courtauld Trust, The Courtauld Gallery, London) not eschew post-Freudian insight if it is useful. For once we start to think about dreaming, not in terms of iconography but of its seemingly irrational logic, we are on an unconven- tional path that may turn, to adapt Freud's metaphor, into a royal road to understanding. In the Sogno , the artist's sketchy depiction of the "vices" served to convey their statús as dream images in the mind of the dreamer. Something like this is suggested in the Bayonne drawing, although since the haziness of the background fig- ures was not preserved in the Windsor drawing, the sketchy figures may simply represent ideas in formation, as in many compositional studies. Even so, the visual resemblance of the dream images in the Sogno to Michelangelo's initial study in the Bacchanal points to a certain overlap in his mind, where both dreams and ideas for compositions came unbidden. By his own acknowledgment, if Hollanda quoted the artist accu- rately, conscious and unconscious processes interpenetrated: images produced in his mind (the inner eye) were sorted, used, and combined by the rational intellect ( entendimiento ). By the evidence of Michelangelo's art, the act of drawing kept the sifting process going, as the hand found new combi- nations and possibilities for meaning. Sometimes final choices were made on the sheet as contours firmed up; sometimes decisions were deferred, to be resolved elsewhere, or not. Michelangelo was not exceptional in drawing creatively on images that came into his mind spontaneously, but he was unusual among Renaissance artists in allowing the unratio- nalized promptings from his imagination to leave their visi- ble trace so frequently. Many of his drawings contain vestiges of earlier ideas. The Bayonne drawing is exemplary in pre- senting several possible attitudes for the reclining man: red chalk outlines propose a raised left arm and larger torso, while black contours show the arm at the man's side and the torso smaller; the head is, in alternative solutions, thrown back or slumped forward. A decision for any one of these might impart a different meaning to the whole.54 The entire drawing projects a tentative, searching mind-set, as if the act of drawing would tell the artist what this strange image might mean. It looks, in these respects, very much like one's initial effort to recall a dream. It is not my intention to argue that the Bacchanal was inspired by a dream, which is neither knowable nor essential to the argument. Rather, I want to approach both the Ba- yonne sketch, which does not make recognizable sense, and the finished Children's Bacchanal , which elaborates an idea that remains cryptic, armed with some basic tenets of dream interpretation. Though most of these principles were first stated by Freud and Carl Jung, they have filtered into psy- choanalytic practice as methodological guides that are often applied in dream analysis. First, everything and every charac- ter in a dream represents an aspect of the dreamer.55 Sec- ond, dreams are primarily visual images, whose "episodes" we convert into stories that make narrative sense but are often expressions of the same idea in different symbolic forms.56 Third, all dreams have multiple significances. The symbolic form of dreams is not representational (x = y), but associational (x = many). A single dream image can have many possible associations, even contradictory ones, which may converge to produce new meaning, or the inti- mation of wholeness and integration.57 When faced with a choice of interpretations, dream analysts recommend, it is more productive to think in terms not of "either-or" but of "both-and." As both Jung and Renaissance alchemists advised, one should look for signification where contradic- tory elements intersect or where disparate things are brought together in a new unitary figure, whose promise is the resolution of conflicts.58 The problem of determining the precise mental state of the slumped recumbent man who appears in the Bayonne drawing and the Children 's Bacchanal is effectively eliminated by applying dream logic (to coin a phrase that is only seem- ingly an oxymoron). We need not decide whether the man is drunk or asleep because, to the Renaissance mind, these were related states, connected by the equation forged sepa- rately for each with vacatio , the precondition for creative inspiration or religious ecstasy.59 It is a perfect example of the need for a "both-and" interpretation, appropriate in this context for an ambivalent visual keynote whose two possible readings embrace the potential of drink for ruin or inspira- tion. The man's slumber may be wine-induced, but because he is in a state of vacatio , he could be dreaming creative ideas - including the one depicted above his head, for one</page><page sequence="8">MICHELANGELO IN LOVE: DECODING THE CHILDREN'S BACCHANAL 31 way to read this entire image is as a dream of the sleeper who is also represented within it. Ambiguous or ambivalent images can mean different things to different viewers, of course, and in her reading of the Sogno , Ruvoldt emphasizes its appeal to "multiple inter- pretative possibilities."60 My interest here is not in audiences who interpret an image in diverse ways but, instead, in the possibility that the image might hold a synthesizing power, at least for the person who produced it. Dream logic works by combining incongruous or contradictory elements to pro- duce a potent new meaning, offering the dreamer the prom- ise of reconciling contradictory or problematic aspects of his or her life. If the Children's Bacchanal is subjected to such logic, its ambiguous or incongruous figures and groups need not stump us, but might profitably be taken as meaningful fusions that point to Michelangelo's intentions, whether con- scious, unconscious, or both. They can point to specific inter- pretations, such as the reading I will advance here, which makes sense in the context of the artist's known concerns and passions. To seek a correct interpretation, however, would be wrongly reductive, for, as dream analysis shows, the human unconscious produces richer and more complex polyvalent images and metaphors than what is rationally intended by artists or circumscribed by art historians. To fol- low the way of thinking that dream interpretation inspires, we should ask not what the drawing means, but how it means. Dream logic can be seen in Michelangelo's composition of The Fall of Phaeton , which Michelangelo made in three ver- sions, perhaps as alternatives for Cavalieri to choose from. In the version in the Accademia, Venice, which may have been the first (though scholars differ on this),61 the emphasis is on the falling horses that are rendered in sharp detail while the rest of the figures are barely sketched (Fig. 11). Their rapid, upside-down descent is stressed by the vertical axis on which they are paired iconically. Phaeton falls along this cen- tral axis, his outstretched arms answered by those of the river god Eridanus below, who is young, unbearded, and muscular and an active participant in the drama. Their interaction is consistent with Ovid's account, in which Eridanus receives Phaeton and bathes his face when he falls far from home.62 In the Michelangelo-Cavalieri context, the dynamic of love precipitated and reciprocated is strongly hinted. It is relevant, as Leonard Barkan observed, that cavaliere means horseman,63 and so the wordplay may have prompted the choice of subject. Indeed, Michelangelo is known to have enjoyed wordplay and double meanings, as well as the substi- tuting of images for words.64 Or, in just the way that a dream will produce a powerful double entendre, the visual image may have come first to the love-enchanted Michelangelo, an image in which falling horses, off balance and upside down, are a metonym for falling in love with a man named Cavalieri. Michelangelo's depiction of Phaeton's fall to earth after wrecking his father's chariot is sometimes said to have been inspired by an antique Phaeton sarcophagus,65 yet since in that relief horses are neither falling nor upside down, the mere reminder of the theme by the relief could have prompted the artist to contextualize a visual image that came to him spontaneously - just as Freud says we do in dreaming.

Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice, inv. no. 177 (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venezia, Su concessione del Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali) In dream logic, the Phaeton drawings do not express a moral position, such as Michelangelo's allegorical self-punishment for his transgressive declaration of love in the Ganymede. Instead, they present a "picture of a feeling."66 The falling protagonist, the horses, and the characters below all partake in this emotion, and the horses are the keynote, a point emphasized in their clear and distinct visual realization. In the symbolic order of the dream, all these elements are dimensions of the artist's emotional state, joined to express collectively the intense sensations of danger and risk, instabil- ity and vertigo, that love has brought. The Hornless Deer The emotionally charged upside-down horses of the Phaeton design may have helped inspire the image of a large, upside- down deer that is the nexus of the central episode in the Children 's Bacchanal. This passage is the most dramatic of the three additions to the Bayonne composition, an interpola- tion that separates the sleeper/ dreamer from the wine-vat boys, while aligning them loosely on a three-stage vertical axis.

The ani- mal at the heart of this composition looks something like a horse, but its cloven hoofs identify it unmistakably as a deer, specifically the red deer, which is the largest species. How- ever, the animal lacks thé deer' s other key signifier: his ant- lers. This could be one of the rare breeds without anders but, more likely, the lack itself is significant. The hornless deer, I propose, may be a figure for Michelangelo the artist, a possi- bility that is suggested by a cluster of associations between the horns of a deer and the tools of a sculptor. The Latin word oryx describes both a stonemason's pickax and a kind of deer or antelope, so called for its long, nearly straight, pointed horns, which are found in both sexes.67 The two meanings were intertwined from an early time, and the connection survives in some modern Italian dictionaries, where the Italian word for the deer, orige (or orice, orece) is said to come from the ancient Greek orux (hoe, pick) , while piccone (pickax, stonemason's hammer) is derived from orussõ , mean- ing scavo (to dig), with reference to the form of the horns.68 Dictionaries favor the naming of the animal from the pickax its horns resembled, while archaeological evidence and logic favor the reverse, that the deer's antlers were first used for dig- ging, giving rise to the same word for both in Greek.69 In either case, a linguistic link between a pickax and deer horns had been forged many centuries before Michelangelo's time.70 This arcane (to us) association between anders and stone- cutters' tools is conceptually related to Michelangelo's use of a different sculptural tool as an extension of himself. In a marginal note on a drawing for a David, the artist wrote, "David with his sling, and I with my bow" (the arco , or bow, that was a sculptor's hand drill), metaphorically asserting his quest to defeat his own giant (the gigantic marble block) as the biblical David had conquered Goliath.71 As Irving Lavin has shown, Michelangelo's arco also alluded to another sculp- tural tool, the seste ad arco , or bowed caliper (compass or dividers) used to transfer dimensions from a model to the full-scale sculpture (Fig. 12), which was, as Lavin notes, "the sculptor's primary instrument of measurement and proportion."72 Since the bowed caliper also resembles deer antlers, the metaphor could have come as well through this channel. Or, by dream logic, the entire cluster of associations joined in Michelangelo's mind to produce an explosive mul- tiple signifier that is invoked by its unexpected absence. Another sculptor/stonemason allusion is seen in the boy wearing a turban on the far right of the deer-carrying group, who is a carryover, in reverse, of the turbaned figure of Nico- demus in Raphael's Entombment (Fig. 8). Nicodemus was fre- quendy depicted wearing a turban, perhaps in reference to his own associations with sculpture.73 Turbans could inde- pendendy denote the practice of sculpture, as in the sculp- ture workshop relief below Nanni di Banco 's Four Crowned Saints at Orsanmichele, Florence, and in Lorenzo Ghiberti's turbaned self-portrait on his first doors for the Florentine Baptistery, which alludes to his work in the manual art of sculpture. In the Bacchanal , several spińtelli wear some sort of headdress, but only two wear sculptor's turbans - one at each end of the deer-carrying group. Moreover, the turban seems to have been a personal signifier for Michelangelo, to judge from his turbaned head in a portrait drawing in Paris, from which painted versions by Giuliano Bugiardini and others may derive (Fig. 13), and from a turbaned figure with his fea- tures in the Crucifixion of Saint Peter , who has been identified as a self-portrait (Fig. 23). 74 Let us postulate, then, that Michelangelo occupies the cen- tral group both as the turbaned sculptor-putto and as the sculpture-alluding orige. The omission of the deer's horns is odd (and invites explanation in any case, as do the hat-wearing 13 Florentine artist, Portrait Drawing of Michelangelo, ca. 1520-22, pen and ink, 143/s x 97/s in.

The deer's lack is stressed by the isolation of his head against an empty space opened by a parting of legs. Michelan- gelo lacks the most important of the sculptor's tools, his seste - what better way to speak of the blindness of one afflicted by love? For in the absence of the horns and in the plight of the disoriented deer, another of Michelangelo's metaphors is invoked: his legendary faith in the importance of the giudizio dell'occhio, the judgment of the trained eye, and his personal conviction that he had compasses, or seste, in his own eyes.75 Upside down, confused, and blinded - one eye is covered by a child's hand - the hornless deer is a powerfully effective figure for a man who has lost his compass. In the sonnets written for Cavalieri, Michelangelo expresses similar feelings of disorientation and loss of con- trol that love has brought, in ever-changing metaphoric terms. In one (no. 70), he is rudderless; he has "wandered about and gone astray / like an empty ship turning in every wind."76 Others offer images of his blinding by Tommaso 's dazzling beauty: "I see, with your beautiful eyes, a sweet light / that with my blind ones I could never see" (no. 89). His love is shaped by metaphors of fire and burning that are no less intense for being Petrarchan conventions. He is paradoxi- cally drawn to that which destroys: "My only food is what flares up and burns, / and that which others die from, I need to live" (no. 74). He speaks of [his] "heart, which is more alive / the hotter the fire" (no'. 93) . In light of this poetic metaphor, the boiling pot heated by flames toward which the tormented deer is propelled might represent the burning crucible of the artist's passion. The agents of this translation, as well as of heating the fire, are baby incarnations of Eros, whose primary signification is the uncontrollable nature of erotic love. Michelangelo under- lines the erotic theme at the heart of the composition: the determined spińtello who links the deer-carrying group with the boiling pot plants one hand on the deer's haunch and the other near his groin, perhaps even grasping his penis.77 This shockingly intimate action on an animal hints that sexu- ality is at stake, and of the deer's anthropomorphic shadow identity. The boys tug the struggling deer toward the boiling pot, a translation that mimics Raphael's sacred entombment of Christ, yet as if in profane parody the animal is carried toward the sacrificial site not headfirst, but with genitals leading. After his sacrifice on the cross, the dead Christ was buried so that he could rise again; his entombment marks the translation from human to divine. The deer that stands for Michelangelo's pas- sion for Cavalieri will be sacrificed while alive - but toward what outcome? Before we follow the deer to his fiery fate, let us examine the two groups in the lower level of the composi- tion, for the strand they jointly introduce will clarify the point of the deer's sacrifice, as well as the effect of disorienting love on this sculptor who has lost his seste. The Sleeping Man The sleeping man's pose, seen with multiple possibilities in the Bayonne drawing (Fig. 9), has been decisively finalized in the Windsor drawing: he now slumps forward, his body bent into a curve, and his symmetrically extended arms hang over a draped form (Fig. 14). Has his identity also been determined? Some scholars have interpreted him as Silenus, as counterpart to the satyress who parallels him, but his beau- tiful body is idealized, not fat or comical like that of Silenus.78 His pose brings to mind the dead Christ in the drawing made later for Vittoria Colonna in 1542, an imago pietatis that juxta- poses death and despair with the promise of resurrection and rebirth, for which the Bacchanal figure must have been a template (Fig. 15). The Chris t-with-hanging-arms appeared earlier in a study for a Lamentation on the reverse of the Ba- yonne drawing, a connection that prompted Alexander Nagel to speak of an "inspired dialogue" between the Bacchic scene and the Passion scene on both sides of the sheet.79</page><page sequence="11">34 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 1 15 Michelangelo, Pieta (for Vittoria Colonna), 1542, black chalk, lP/s X 7Vèin. (28.9 x 18.9 cm). Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston) Nagel rightly detects a dialogue, although the man with hanging arms cannot literally be Christ, who would have no place in this pagan bacchanal. If a primary identity is embed- ded in Michelangelo's sleeping man, it is his own. The sleeper/dreamer supports himself on a draped block whose contours can be discerned through the cloth as rectan- gular or square. This reminds us of the block on which Hera- clitus rests in the School of Athens , in Raphael's late addition to the composition that has been widely recognized as an embedded portrait of the sculptor/ architect/ poet Michelan- gelo (Fig. 16) .80 In Raphael's homage to the master of the contemporaneous Sistine Ceiling, the philosopher's medita- tive pose alludes obliquely to his melancholic genius, via Michelangelo's brooding self-portrait in the Sistine Jeremiah (Dürer's Melencolia I of 1514 was still a few years away). When the figure was inserted into the School of Athens , Michel- angelo's melancholic identity was not yet fully shaped,81 and the marble block was primarily a sign of his identity as sculp- tor and architect. By the time the Children's Bacchanal was drawn, however, the sculptural block on which the Michelangelized Heraclitus leans had acquired a richer meaning, here resonating of that pure potential that Michelangelo first described in a sonnet for Cavalieri: "within marbles are images rich or worthless, / depending on what our talents can draw out of them." Later, in his most famous sonnet, he would turn this into artistic theory: that the single marble block contained within its boundaries all possible ideas, attainable only to the hand that obeys the intellect.82 Unlike the marble block in the School of Athens , which functions as a creative support both as writing base and tabula rasa, the block that supports the sleeping man in the Bacchanal is creatively inaccessible to him - it is covered, and his back is turned against it. Since by 1533 Michelangelo was well aware of his reputation as melancholic, it seems a knowing reference to Raphael's image of him as a melancholic genius.83 Despite the efforts of a spińtelb to rouse him, this man is in a state of paralysis and torpor. He is an almost histrionic exaggeration of the melancholic tempera- ment Michelangelo was thought to embody: he has lost his will, is unable to create, and has given up in despair. The image is a visual correlative of the opening lines of a poem quoted above (no. 70): "O cruel star, or rather, cruel will / that constrains and binds my power and my volition." If Michelangelo the artist inhabits the body of the sleeping man, he is also present in the guise of others. Because the drunken Silenus and the dying Christ are brought to mind by iconographie hints, they, too, haunt the figure's identity. (The question is not, Who is he? but, How does he signify?) Christ is the more obvious shadow persona. The sleeper's outstretched arms and hanging head evoke Christ's agony and death on the cross, injecting the theme of sacrifice - implicitly, in this case, the artist's sacrifice to his art. Michel- angelo's self-image as bound to the will of others, an image 16 Raphael, School of Athens, detail showing Heraclitus, 1511, fresco.

(91 x 107 cm). Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Scala, provided by Art Resource, NY) of self-sacrifice, is a constant theme in his writings. What Rob- ert Liebert explained as "Michelangelo's profound need to see himself as captive" applied to both love and art.84 In let- ters, he describes himself as a slave to the wishes of his papal patrons: "I lost the whole of my youth, chained to this Tomb [of Julius II], contending, as far as I was able, against the demands of Popes Leo and Clement."85 In poetry, he simi- larly defines himself as a prisoner of love, "tortured" or "martyred" by his desires.86 The sleeper's apparent drunkenness invokes the god Dio- nysos (Fig. 7) and his drinking companion Silenus. As Svet- lana Alpers and Lisa Rosenthal have shown, Silenus was for Peter Paul Rubens, as for Virgil, a "paradigm of ecstatic, pro- tean, and Dionysian creativity," whose "effeminized disempow- erment is a condition of generating art."87 Michelangelo's pairing of quasi-Silenus and the nursing satyress is echoed and perhaps clarified in Rubens 's painted Bacchanal of about 1613-15, where the poetic creativity of the drunken Silenus is juxtaposed with the natural procreativity of the satyress (Fig. 17).88 Michelangelo's allusion to Silenus, avatar of Diony- sian divine furor who generated art in his drunken state, intro- duces the latent potential for creativity within the artistic genius who suffers melancholic paralysis. As a shadow identity for the artist, this quasi-SilenuS is positioned in structural dia- logue with one of his mythological band, the nursing satyress, yet with quite different consequences for the art-nature rela- tion than is seen in Rubens. The Nursing Satyress On the left side of the base zone sits an aged satyress, who allows a child to nurse at her withered dug, while another child sits on her thigh with his back turned (Fig. 18). She is differentiated from nursing satyresses of the period by her somber aspect and demeanor (compare, for example the playful spirit of the group in the left foreground of Piero di Cosimo 's Discovery of Honey) and by the fact that her children are not of her species: they have human bod- ies, not the goats' legs that were more common in satyr families.89 This mother's barrenness is underscored by her sacklike, empty breasts, a departure from the associations with animal fertility and natural abundance that satyrs and satyresses usually carry - associations that Rubens heartily sustained. Michelangelo's image of the satyress as old and exhausted, unable to supply milk, may refer to Leon Battista Alberti 's characterization of Natura as the mother-nurturer of artists, who had previously produced geniuses and giants but now was "old and tired," having spent her resources before the dawn of the Renaissance.90 Michelangelo would, of course, become a living refutation of Alberti' s contrived despair (Alberti used the device to introduce Filippo Brunelleschi 's genius to the world) , and, as I have elsewhere argued, Michel- angelo cast himself as a specially favored child of Mother Nature. We see this formula in his repeated depiction in sculp- tures and drawings of the nursing Christ Child, who repre- sents, metaphorically, the artist drawing sustenance from his mother, Mary/Natura.91 The Children's Bacchanal, in pointed contrast, offers an artist-nature relationship more in keeping with Alberti 's poetic figure: a cold and withdrawn, or simply worn-out, mother who cannot or will not feed her human chil- dren, artists who seek her nurture. The nursing satyress group, like the sleeping man, alludes intertextually to Michelangelo's own art. Its structural com- position, a mother with one child nursing and another rest- ing on her thigh, resembles the central unit of a drawing that has recently joined Michelangelo's oeuvre, a Holy Family</page><page sequence="13">36 ART bulletin march 2014 VOLUME xcvi number 1 18 Michelangelo, Children' s Bacchanal, detail showing the nursing satyress group.

In the Bacchanal , we see a troubled artist-nature relationship. One child tries unsuccessfully to draw his mother's nurturing milk; the other turns his back on her. The second child's pose incorporates a reference that would have been recognized in this period: the association between male buttocks shown from the rear, da tergo , and male homosexual intercourse.93 Images of the male nude da tergo typically held seductive erotic appeal (a classic example is Parmigianino's Cupid Sharpening His Bow), but Michelangelo summons up that trope in order to deny it, for turning one's back on Nature, contra noturam, is a way of saying with extraordinary visual economy that homosex- ual practice is against nature - as was preached by its Renais- sance critics94 - in this case imparting a negative meaning to homosexual attraction. It is in this context another sign of dys- function in the family unit. The base zone of the Bacchanal presents two images of cre- ative dysfunction. Dream logic leads us to see that these are not separate narrative episodes but expressions of the same idea in different symbolic form. On each side, the artist's back is turned on a potential source of creativity - the child on his nursing mother, the man against his marble block. Each unit evokes a more productive counterpart: the satyress group recalls the Holy Family; the dreamer-and-his-block recalls the Michelangelo quotation in the School of Athens. Not only are the artist and Natura unable to perform their individual creative or procreative roles, they also turn away from one another and are formally disconnected. The sepa- ration between Natura and the artist is heightened by a fis- sure in the rock between them, a vertical caesura that emphasizes their isolation, crammed into separate pockets of a gloomy netherworld. A tentative link between the groups is provided by the lightly sketched objects on the ground: a lamb or goat head and a chalice placed on a cloth.95 In both Christian and antique iconography, these objects allude to ritual sacrifice: Christ as Lamb of God and the Eucharistie chalice that holds his sacrificial blood, or the Dionysian gift of wine and the goat sacrificed to produce it.96 Themes of pagan sacrifice appear in Renaissance art, sometimes understood as foreshadowing</page><page sequence="14">MICHELANGELO IN LOVE: DECODING THE CHILDREN'S BACCHANAL 37 20 Michelangelo, Children's Bacchanal, detail showing the pot-boiling group.

The sacrificial goat and the wine/blood chalice, as ritual objects common to both religions, may symbolize religious rites per se. They lie between the satyress and the sleeper, pertaining to them equally, yet they are so faintly rendered, they fail to connect the groups effectively - implying that they, too, are unproduc- tive. And, perhaps, that they, too, stand for dated, conven- tional concepts. Ritual objects that have lost their power are juxtaposed with a cold and indifferent Natura who no longer nurtures artistic geniuses and a despairing melancholic artist exhausted by service to others and paralyzed by his own lack of will. Sacrificing the Red Deer While the drawing's lower zone speaks of creative dysfunc- tion and conventional sacrificial ritual, the middle zone encompasses sacrifice in a more immediate, physical, and vio- lent way. At bottom are frozen and cramped, static figure groups; in the middle is a scene that is active, dynamic, and hot. The gap between the two groups below is bridged on the next tier by the stamping féet of spińtelli who descend from the boiling pot to the deer. The deer-bearing group bulges at its center, countering the concave indentation beneath. This sense of expansive bulging is due to the addition of one figure, the putto with his back to us, a figure not present in Raphael's Entombment. His value is more than formal, for, seen da tergo, he echoes the back-turned child on the satyress 's lap below. This boy's vigorous contrapposto, his organically supple body, plump buttocks, and energetic par- ticipation in the action give the da tergo view a more attractive aspect than was signaled by the crabbed child below, suggest- ing a shift in meaning for the coded reference. On this tier, homosexuality is not contra naturam but fully and whole- somely natural. This small shift of meaning is a keynote for the new expres- sive cast of the middle zone, which features libidinous sexual- ity, unblocked freedom of movement, and a crisis. By contrast to the lower plane, here there is life and feeling, even suspense. The erotes are going to consign the helpless, rudderless, topsy-turvy deer to the bubbling heat of the pot they stir, which has already consumed the flesh of smaller beasts (Fig. 20). A rabbit skin and a boar's head hang from a tree above; one pig or boar is being boiled in a large pot, as another is brought to be sacrificed. Flames from the fire below are so hot that one boy protectively covers his face. Nonetheless, more heat is needed, for the fire is stoked by one boy and blow-fanned by another, while two more bring faggots to increase the flames. The boys tug the struggling deer leftward to be sacrificed. That the deer is too large for this pot is a reminder that, despite the allusions to a plot, we are in a symbolic and not narrative realm. The arrested and counterpoised movements of the deer-bearing group also support an iconic rather than narrative reading. The turbaned boy on the right pulls against the leftward lateral flow to slow the movement, and he stands back, less engaged than the others, wearing a con- templative expression that Hirst described as a "haunted, ani- mated pathos."98 This alternative surrogate for Michelangelo considers his plight more thoughtfully than can the thrash- ing deer. The convergence of two metaphoric self-images, the deer's right front leg pinned under the turbaned boy's arm, effectively conveys Michelangelo's creative paralysis in the grip of love - he is prohibited, or prohibits himself, from</page><page sequence="15">38 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 1 21 After Andrea Mantegna, Larvate Erotes Frightening Two Companions , late 15th or early 16th century, pen and brown ink, 8!/s X 7 in.

The boy's expres- sion deepens the significance of the moment, as his pose helps pause the action, so that the meaning of the central episode, as projected both by the deer's disorientation and his sacrifice, is on display for consideration. What is the meaning of the deer's sacrifice? The evidence of Michelangelo's poetry suggests that this metaphoric sacri- fice of the artist to his passion for Cavalieri will be beneficial. Nearly every one of the poems addressed to Tommaso con- tains a metaphor of fire and burning to convey his beloved's effect on him. In number 57, he acknowledges its restorative benefit: "Since I gain more life from one who burns and sears me, / just as more fuel or wind makes a fire flare up." The theme of passion's flame as a source of healing and self-renewal is sometimes a paradox. In number 54, he ponders: "What a strange thing, that the pain of fire is often cured by fire." In sonnet 62, Michelangelo links the transfor- mative power of fire to renew the lover with fire's power to refine art: Only with fire can the smith shape iron from his conception into fine, dear work; neither, without fire, can any artist refine and bring gold to its highest state, nor can the unique phoenix be revived unless first burned. And so, if I die burning, I hope to rise again brighter among those Whom death augments and time no longer hurts. Just as the passage through fire brings the sculptor's concetto to its realization, so the lover's burning passion will gain him transcendence in death. Michelangelo speaks here of bronze casting, which was not his medium, yet in another sonnet he manages to connect fire with marble and stone." The com- mon theme, in both love and art, is the consuming and puri- fying action of fire. In the lowest zone of the Bacchanal, the artist is sacrificed to his art. On the second tier, sacrifice by fire is essential for his art. The hornless deer, or Michelangelo the artist, is adrift, disoriented by love, and disarmed by the loss of his seste. It is love that comes to the rescue, for the erotes know that the only way out is the boiling pot that will render his burning flesh, as the pig's flesh is rendered, that is, purified, its solid flesh transformed into liquid as the fire transforms base metal into the higher state of gold. On the second tier, as below, the self is embedded in the mythic. The sacrifice of the Michelangian deer in the Chil- dren's Bacchanal is conducted strictly according to Bacchic convention, for it closely resembles the Dionysian sacrifice depicted on the Vatican puteal illustrated above (Fig. 6) . As Carl Kerényi explains, this involved boiling the sacrificial ani- mal (in ancient Greece, a young goat or kid; in the puteal, a wild boar) in a kettle filled with the goat mother's milk.100 The kid, a substitute for Dionysos as the divine child, is mysti- cally reunited with its mother (as Dionysos rejoined his divine mother in the underworld) , and when the goat's body parts are consumed by initiates, they, too, partake of Diony- sian divinity. The sacrifice of the goat and its ritual consump- tion are necessary to ensure the annual regrowth of the vine and the renewal and endurance of life. It is a short step from Dionysos to Attis and Adonis, and then Christ, and to the rec- ognition of the common purpose of ritual sacrifice in sequential Mediterranean religions.101 A mythically broad understanding of sacrifice is implied in Michelangelo's sonnets for Cavalieri, in which metaphors of burning and consuming are linked, sometimes paradoxically, with Cavalieri's power to revitalize and restore him. Such an understanding is visually underlined in the Children 's Baccha- nal by the restaging of Raphael's Entombment in pagan guise. Michelangelo was no anthropologist, but in the Christian religion he knew well and in the antique art he admired, the purpose of sacrifice was always clear. Just as Christ's entomb- ment is followed by his resurrection, so must one go through suffering and a form of death in order to be born anew. And so the sacrifice of the deer is essential for the artist's spiritual rebirth and the return of his creative powers. When the flesh of the sacrificial animal is rendered and consumed, the skin and head remain, as Michelangelo shows in the rabbit skin and boar skull that hang above the caul- dron. They are material vestiges of the transformative pro- cess: in the shedding of his skin, the deer/artist's spirit will be liberated. The sloughing of skin to gain new life is a recur- rent theme in Michelangelo's poems. He wrote in number 33 (dated 1524-29): "like an old serpent through a narrow space / may I pass, shedding my old armor, / and may my soul, stripped of its old habit / and of everything human, be restored to life." In number 94, a sonnet of about 1535, prob- ably written for Cavalieri, he envies the lowly creature that "strips off its own skin, and only through death might be called truly born," wishing that he might similarly change his</page><page sequence="16">MICHELANGELO IN LOVE: DECODING THE CHILDREN'S BACCHANAL 39 22 Francesco Salviati, after Michelangelo, Allegory of Prudence, ca. 1531-40, red chalk on laid paper, lOVs X 14VŽ in.

They are indices, in a Peircian sense, of a past condition - old armor and old habit shed, so that the artist may enter a new life. The imagined realization of that new life is found in the climax of the progression, the wine-vat scene at upper right. The compositional flow embodies the flow of the liber- ated spirit, directing our gaze to this unexpected resolution: the upward, diagonal right movement is initiated in the flames under the pot and the angle of the deer's hind legs. A sweep of curving drapery takes us to the crouching boy next to the wine barrel, who propels us into the group of laugh- ing, irreverent children. Can this wine-vat group, the seem- ingly least serious of the entire composition, really embody the goal of the spiritual journey? Perhaps so, if we keep in mind the drawing's genre and purpose. At the site of Michelangelo's pig-boiling sacrifice, a child stands at far left who, uniquely among the spińtelli , observes the action but does not participate. His playful crouch and laughing face signal that he is enjoying the spec- tacle. Folds on his wrists and back, and his covered groin, indicate that the boy may be clothed. He wears a carefully detailed helmet, with a line under the chin that might be a strap, or could indicate a mask. In their engravings after the Children's Bacchanal, Enea Vico and Nicolas Beatrizet made these ambiguous indications explicit, giving the child a belted tunic, an elaborated helmet, and a more clearly masked face.104 Masked putti are common enough in Roman and Renais- sance imagery to be a named type, larvate erotes. They frequently wear a Silenus mask to frighten their spińtelli companions (Fig. 21). Michelangelo touched on this theme in a lost drawing known from replicas, in which a child wearing an upside-down mask approaches an allegorical figure of Pru- dence and two other children (Fig. 22). The drawing's tone has convincingly been identified as facetious and mock- ing.105 Although the Latin word larva , literally, "mask," can also allude to death,106 the playful spirit of this drawing sug- gests that the primary meanings of a mask- disguise, arti- fice, pretending - are more relevant. Similarly, in the Children's Bacchanal , the laughing masked observer may be present to signal that the pot boiling is only play, an illu- sion, whose outcome will be a happy one. The Armed Cavalier The person to whom such a signal would mean most is the drawing's recipient, Tommaso de' Cavalieri. I propose that the little masked observer is a burlesque representation of Tommaso himself. He is present in disguise, but his helmet is a dead giveaway, linking the figure to the cavaliere armato of sonnet number 98 just as directly and clearly as does the young victor in the sculptural Victory.107 A cavaliere is a knight on horseback; armed, he is a soldier. Comparable to the masked boy's helmet are those of the horse-mounted soldiers in Michelangelo's Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Fig. 23). Renais- sance soldier helmets vary widely in style, yet common to many is a strap under the chin, secured to the helmet by leather sidepieces. The sideburn flap, being functional, is one feature that distinguishes a helmet from an invented fan- tastic headgear. Many Renaissance helmets also had attached visors that could be raised or lowered; a convenient example is seen in Dürer' s Knight , Death and the Devil , where the visor lifts to a peak above the knight's face. We see these features in miniature in the Bacchanal , and again in a drawing in Oxford that has been grouped with</page><page sequence="17">40 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 1 23 Michelangelo, Crucifixion of Saint Peter, 1542-45, detail showing soldiers in left background, fresco. Cappella Paolina, Papal Palace, Vatican City (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Scala, provided by Art Resource, NY) Michelangelo's teste divine , or "ideal heads," in a figure whose headdress is often described as fantastic or exotic (Fig. 24). 108 The headgear of the figure in this drawing is far less exotic than many Michelangelo depicted, and with its side flaps and raised visor, it is generically akin to that of the Bacchanal putto, as are both to helmets of the period. Why should both figures not represent Tommaso de' Cavalieri, one a life study and the other a playful caricature? Despite Michelangelo's aversion to portraiture, he is known to have drawn a portrait of Tommaso, to which this drawing may be related, as some scholars have surmised.109 A few have even conjectured that Cavalieri might have been the model for the Oxford drawing.110 Yet none to my knowledge has con- nected the young man's helmet with Michelangelo's imagi- native figuration of Cavalieri as a soldier in the last lines of the sonnet the artist addressed to his beloved: "I remain the prisoner of an armed cavalier."111 The possibility that the Oxford drawing portrays Michel- angelo's beloved lends support to the identification of Cava- lieri with the handsome youth of the sculptural Victory , whose sensuous profile resembles the profile in the drawing (Fig. 25). 112 The typological similarity of Michelangelo's ideal heads complicates the matter, of course. Perhaps more accu- rately, these images are connected to Cavalieri not as identifi- able portraits, but as specimens of ideal beauty distilled from his particular physiognomy and linked through their associa- tive referents to his name. Nonetheless, on the strength of the poetic trope alone, many scholars have accepted the met- aphoric casting of Tommaso as victor over a vanquished Michelangelo in the Victory , a statue that has long been con- nected with Michelangelo's projects for the tomb of Julius II. The Victory has been convincingly dated to 1531-34 on for- mal grounds, contemporary with Michelangelo's statue of Duke Giuliano in the Medici Chapel, with whom the young victor shares the incipient mannerism of refined facial fea- tures and a long, elegantly twisted neck.113 The question of its origins, whether as one of the two-figure groups of allegor- ical Victories planned in the early projects for the tomb's lower level, reworked to fit the reduced project of 1532, or as a new sculptural group, perhaps for that project or perhaps for Cavalieri himself, is a complicated matter, not to be resolved here.114 It is sufficient to register that the metaphor of the cavaliere armato may have had broader scope. In the period of his deep involvement with Tommaso de' Cavalieri, Michelangelo produced three images - the helmeted child in the Bacchanal, the Oxford helmeted youth, and the sculp- tural Victory - that can credibly be understood to represent his beloved as the armed cavalier he extolled in poetry. The Boys in the Wine Vat In July 1533, Michelangelo was still in Florence, wanting nothing more than to be with Cavalieri. In a draft of a letter to his friend Bartolommeo Angelini, he wrote: if I long day and night, as it were, without any intermission to be in Rome, it is merely in order to return to life, which is impossible without the soul. And since the heart is in truth the abode of the soul, and my heart being for the first time in the hands of him to whom you have confided my soul, the natural impulse was for it to return to its own abode.115 Recognizing the Neoplatonic basis for the artist's conception of his beloved as an alter ego, the soul of his heart, Edith Balas connected Michelangelo's words with Ficino's identification of the beloved as a projection of self: "after I have lost myself, if I recover myself through you, I have myself through you."116 24 Michelangelo, Ideal Head (Portrait of Tommaso Cavalieri?), 1532- 34, red chalk, 8Vs x 6V2 in.

Michelangelo has been liberated by his love for Tommaso to recover his creative energy, which - the struc- tured sequences of the drawing imply - comes in the form of sensual and sexual awakening and permission to enjoy this without guilt. Cavalieri 's presence in the guise of a mischie- vous child sets the tone and guides us to the site where the awakened senses are at equally mischievous play. Our eyes move swiftly, through drapery lines that stretch like electric wires, from the pot-boiling scene to the wine-vat scene (Fig. 26) . A crouching boy leads us in, a thirsty boy dips into the wine vat; there is an absorbed grape stomper, a greedy toper who pours and drinks at the same time, and a smiling boy who pisses into wine that has been drawn for him. In dream logic, Michelangelo identifies with all of them. It is the realm of creative liberation, newly attained and exuberantly at play. Below, the children work hard to carry the deer, tend the fire, seek mother's milk, or lift a cloth. The wine-vat boys are all pleasure and fun. They express their joy through social transgression - pissing in the wine is like profaning the Host. The pissing putto partakes of a distinct Renaissance genre, as Patricia Simons has shown, whose examples range from deschi da parto, where peeing boys allude to fertility, to lavabos in the Florentine Duomo, where a spińtello standing on an inflated wineskin "makes water," an implicit transformation of fluids that evokes the transubstantiation of the Eucharist.117 Closer to Michelangelo's drawing are images of boys playing in fountains or wine kegs, in which one urinates into a bowl held by another, or into a companion's mouth.118 In these images of laughing boys at intimate play, the transfer of bodily fluids and the close proximity of mouths and penises bring to mind same-sex eroticism.119 In shocking contrast to Michelangelo's "insistent denial of the body"120 and his almost puritanical insistence that his homoerotic affections were entirely chaste and proper, the misbehaving boys beg to differ, as if to upset the applecart of Michelangelo's superego with the runaway apples of his unleashed libido. They perform the role of the archetypal Trickster, intermediary to the unconscious, whose cultural forms range from Hermes Psychopomp to Coyote, and who erases and plays with boundaries. Trickster delivers "the inspirations and energies of the creative impulse," but also "'come-uppance' to those who exhibit hubris."121 His pranks are restorative, for "where someone's sense of honorable behavior has left him unable to act, Trickster will appear to suggest an amoral action, something right/ wrong that will get life going again."122 Michelangelo's comeuppance is his ego's submission - in the rare instance of this drawing - to the greater force of his repressed sexuality. ' Interpreted in this way, the wine-vat scene is the culmina- tion of a journey that begins in the sleeping man's awaken- ing, his progression as the upturned, hornless deer to sacrifice, and then to transformation and release. Simulta- neously, it is a corrective commentary on all that happens below. If pig boiling represents the purifying transformation of flesh into spirit, the wine-vat boys are doing the opposite: adulterating the wine, a spirit symbol in Christian practice, with bodily fluids. They represent the renaturalization of the 25 Michelangelo, Victory , 1531-34, marble, height 8 ft. 6 in. (2.59 m). Palazzo Vecchio, Florence (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Scala, provided by Art Resource, NY) artist, a step beyond the agonistic middle stage in which he struggles against the urges of physical love. Their actions may seem depraved to some, but these spińtelli exude energy and vitality, like the urinating putto and his cohort in Titian's Bac- chanal of the Andńans , which Michelangelo had seen in Fer- rara,123 and like their prototypes in Roman art, who embody nature's natural cycles. Like spińtelli everywhere, they are driven by desire, not by habit. The boy pissing in the wine cup is not really profaning the Host but renaturalizing a rit- ual that had become convention-bound, symbolized by the faint sacrificial objects on the ground zone. This theme is brought home by the contrast of the shallow drinking cups that hold wine (and urine) with the functionless sacramental chalice next to the goat head, a vessel of the same shape. The contrast is between the old, conventional, and outworn and the young, transgressional, and fresh. The Heretical Hierarchy Panofsky's dim assessment of the Windsor Bacchanal cast a long shadow. He described the drawing's mood as "hopeless dejection and lethargy," concluding that the bacchanal is enacted by beings not fully human and might represent a realm lower than that of Tityus and Phaeton , the "sphere of a purely vegetative life." This Neoplatonic reading influenced</page><page sequence="19">42 ART bulletin march 2014 VOLUME xcvi number 1 26 Michelangelo, Children* s Bacchanal, detail showing the wine-vat group. Royal Collection, Windsor Castle, inv. no. RL 12777 (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Royal Collection Trust, © Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 2013) others to equate its theme of drunkenness with the lowest state of the soul trapped in matter.124 Scholars have erred, I believe, in assigning a singular condition to the entire draw- ing, yet Panofsky was not wrong to see Neoplatonic hierarchy in its structural scaffolding. There is hierarchy, and even ascension, but with a difference in value weighting. The Neoplatonic ascension of the soul from "the lowest things to the highest," from enslavement in the earthly prison to the liberating return to God, was given concrete visual form in Michelangelo's designs for the Medici Chapel tombs and in his earlier designs for the tomb of Julius II.125 The lowest level of the Bacchanal is a kind of carcere terreno , or earthly prison, as in the Medici Chapel, although in a sense personal to the artist. Overburdened by thought and work, the sleeping artist has lost contact with both his own spirit and potentially revitalizing nature, here represented by the equally dysfunctional satyress. On the tier above, the artist is awakened to love, and his senses are activated. On this plane, there is physicality and touching, even of sexual parts, as the compassless deer replaces the sleeping man in the artist's stead. Here, Michelangelo enters into a new relationship with nature - his own - for the homosexual erotic denied on the ground floor is embraced on the second plane. Yielding to sacrifice, the artist is transformed by physical love, a trans- formation that generates new creativity, expressed in the final scene where boys frolic in the wine vat. The physical sen- sation and exertions of the second stage give way, on the highest level, to overt sexual play, reckless intemperance, and the uncontrollable behavior that distinguishes spińtelli as agents of the life force. In Neoplatonist orthodoxy, the highest level should be a purely spiritual zone, where intellect and will transcend the world of matter and the senses. In the Bacchanal, this hierar- chy is inverted. We ascend from a zone of intellectual and creative paralysis - the dreamer and his problem, the gloom of the satyress group - to an apex where indulgence of the senses rules. By the rules of hierarchy, the lowest level, the only one where adults appear, is a realm of "shadow and death," while the highest position is taken by children play- ing in the wine vat, a stage of transcendence that follows the baptism by sacrifice. In this drawing, Michelangelo invoked the Neoplatonic hierarchy in order to challenge its priorities. Against the division of love into discrete categories - that is, chaste Socratic homosexual and carnal heterosexual, a division avowed by the Florentine Neoplatonists and by Michelangelo himself - the love-liberated artist posits a topsy-turvy world of children at play, where everything is upside down, from the hapless deer to the scale of values, where nothing of the senses is forbidden and the uncensored indulgence of instinct is celebrated. Michelangelo offered another image of the world upside down in the Allegory of Pru- dence drawing, where a child wearing an upside-down mask enters to frighten other children (Fig. 22). 126 Here, too, is Trickster (signaled by the jester's head on Prudence's mir- ror) , though his potential mischief appears to be checked by the stern, sober Prudence. But, as Paul Barolsky has observed, the drawing is a scherzo that plays with conventional imagery, for, by inverting the allegorical old man's mask, the child makes fun of the allegory, invoking the World Upside Down topos.127 Here, Michelangelo skewers pretension and vanity with playful ridicule. Although mischief has a freer hand in the Children 's Bacchanal, in both drawings, as in the culture-norm inversions of Carnival, the world is turned upside down to mock the right-side up. There are many playful moments in Michelangelo's art, but no other work is so completely devoted to the theme of homo Indens as the Bacchanal, since all but four of its thirty-two characters are engaged in playing. As Johan Huizinga observed in his classic study of this theme, play is the enemy of the serious, a stepping outside "reality" that children and animals do for pleasure, and it is where their freedom lies.128 Play is a vacation from the moral structures and principles</page><page sequence="20">MICHELANGELO IN LOVE: DECODING THE CHILDREN'S BACCHANAL 43 that society depends on, and yet it is more unquestionably real than these abstractions, as an essential component in human makeup that engages our animal nature and our emotions, and embraces the irrational and ecstatic. Michel- angelo's Children's Bacchanal , in toto, is a paean to play, whose signature character is the masked, helmeted baby cava- liere who crouches in a stance that universally says, as if to a puppy, come and play. Crossing the zones to spread their mischief, several spińtelli have escaped from the top level to participate in the lowest sphere (Fig. 14). They arrive as a group of three (a shadowy fourth is subordinated), emissaries from above who come to awaken the sleeper and bring -him wine from the vat. That they have just arrived is signaled by the foreshortened pose and over-the-shoulder head turn of the boy who holds the drinking cup. He first appeared in the Bayonne drawing as the furtive cupbearer who links the wine vat to the reclining man (Fig. 9), whose own antecedent is found in the Sistine Ceiling scene of God Separating Sky and Water, where an angelic companion of God hurtling through space looks backward to evoke the great speed of the Deity's flight. That the young messengers bring a form of salvation to the man sunk in despair is hinted by the number three, the magic number in allegory and myth in which supernatural interven- tion often arrives.129 And in their presentation of a cup to the hero in extremis there is, of course, a reminder of the angels who bring the cup of sacrifice to Christ in Gethsemene. The sleeper is brought a cup of wine enriched by natural body fluids, a signifier of his rebirth in the senses, which will generate new artistic inspiration. A second spińtello pulls back a cloth, unveiling the sleeper - or, given the shortage of fabric, perhaps he is unveiling not the man but the block at his back, to reveal his source of creativity. Again, as in dreams, meaning is deepened by multiple allusions. When Michelangelo drew on the antique "Bed of Polycleitus" relief for this motif of a sleeping male figure unveiled, a connec- tion several writers have pointed out, it may well have been for the reliefs primary meaning: Cupid revealed to Psyche, or love revealed to the soul.130 That allusion would be an appropriate keynote for this drawing. The third figure at far right is the most enigmatic. Eyes closed, a faint smile on his lips, head tilted, he seems to be just waking up, but his body is already moving in a dancelike rhythm. Here is still another surrogate for the artist, the only one to represent his reborn state. Rising to a vertical position, he crooks his right hand into an angle that echoes the left hands of the satyress and the sleeping artist, but unlike their unproductive gestures, this spińtello uses his right hand to make contact with his sexuality. He frames his penis with his fingers, perhaps to proclaim its creative potential, on the analogy of Jacopo della Quercia's Adam at S. Petronio, Bolo- gna, who frames his penis in a measuring angle that evokes God's designing compass to connote the creative power of the male organ (Fig. 27). 131 The judgment of the genitals has replaced the judgment of the eye. And since creativity is generated here, the ground zone is not entirely barren. This is consistent with Michelangelo's identification with night, which he viewed as the dark, fertile matrix where new life and artistic inspiration are produced.132 With the descent of the spińtelli from top to 27 Jacopo della Quercia, Temptation of Adam and Eve, detail showing Adam, ca. 1429-34, stone relief. S. Petronio, Bologna (artwork in the public domain; photograph by Alinari, provided by Art Resource, NY) bottom, a circular movement is initiated, which sweeps to the satyress group, then up to the flames as if through a chimney flue, continuing through the lines that lead right- ward (the flames, the deer's feet, the curtain) to meet the wine-vat group, and then drop again to the bottom on the right. This clockwise movement, a stirring of the composi- tional pot, is initiated in the turning of the deer, whose feet rise and head falls. The deer's destabilizing is the crux of the composition: it makes everything else happen and sets the theme of the drawing, which is the destabilizing yet regenerative power of love. Michelangelo's embrace of erotic love in the Bacchanal contradicts his emphasis on the incompatibility of physical desire and spiritual love in his sonnets and, most conspicu- ously, in the Sogno (Fig. 10). 133 In that drawing, sexuality is acknowledged in the crudely lustful images of "vice" sur- rounding the dreamer, but these are set in opposition to the higher inspiration the dreamer receives from the trumpeting angel. Most scholars have interpreted the drawing's theme as transcendence over physical desires.134 In a more nuanced reading, Ruvoldt finds a mind-body split at the heart of the Sogno , with the artist divided between his attractions to both spiritual ascent and physical desire, a tension thematized in</page><page sequence="21">44 ART BULLETIN MARCH 2014 VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 1 the seductive beauty of the male nude body, which presents to the viewer the very kind of temptation experienced by the artist. Yet resolution in favor of virtue is firmly achieved, as the dreamer directs his gaze upward to glory, averting his eyes from vice.135 The Sogno is a rational visual articulation of ideas about artistic inspiration, filled with formal references that consti- tute a clear moral position on the spiritual-carnal polarity, in which sexual and intellectual generation are kept apart. The beautiful male body may signify the problematic role of sen- sual desire, but its subliminal appeal to the viewer is excluded from the moralizing conclusion and even speaks against it. Michelangelo's own ambivalence about the power of spiritual love to overcome carnal love is seen in the Sogno' s subver- sively positive acknowledgment of the physical in the very image that defines it as an evil temptation. The Sogno posits, nevertheless, a fundamental contradiction between artistic creativity and libidinous sexuality. And the Bacchanal resolves that contradiction. Here, Michelangelo postulates a deeper and more organic connection between sexuality and creativ- ity, in which they are not at odds but interdependent. Did the radical holism expressed in the Bacchanal result from insight brought by the experience of passionate love, or was the drawing a kind of thought experiment in which love's beneficial effect on creativity was extravagantly but rhetori- cally celebrated? To try to determine the proportion of sin- cerity to rhetoric in the Children 's Bacchanal might be a futile effort, since even Michelangelo could not be sure. In one sonnet of the Cavalieri period, he appears to doubt his own sincerity, complicating the very thing he had achieved in the gift drawings. I wish I wanted, Lord, what I don't want: between my heart and the fire hides a veil of ice which moderates the fire, so that my deeds don't match my pen, and makes my page a liar. I love you with my tongue, and then regret That love doesn't reach my heart; yet I don't know where I might open a door to grace, so it can spread Within my heart, and chase out all pitiless pride.136 So successful was his creation of an art that professed romantic passion, the maker laments the failure of his love to match the ecstasy of his pen, that is, his literary and artistic "tongue." The veil of ice might be repressive public opinion, or a self-censoring chill arising from within - this sonnet is unusually cryptic within a cryptic oeuvre - yet Michelangelo seems to voice a paradox that has troubled many poets and artists: experience and emotion may be the honest founda- tion of personally expressive art, but the very reality of the emotions are called into question when exploited for artistic purpose. Or is Michelangelo's lament in this sonnet that his love for Tommaso proceeded from his tongue, not his heart, simply another form of protective deception and self-deception, itself the veil of ice? Perhaps the deeper truth could only be told in an enigmatic drawing that spoke to its maker from beyond his conscious mind, telling him what he would not overtly maintain nor rationally accept: that to acknowledge the legitimacy of his erotic desire for Cavalieri by figuring it openly might put him in touch with his natural sensual core, and show the way to renewed creativity.

Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Open Secrets," esp. 117-22. Leonard Barkan, Transuming Passion: Ganymede and the Erotics of Humanism (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), 82, described the gift drawings and sonnets as "acts of introspection transferred into privacy a deux, but beyond that often circulated within a larger, but still private, coterie." 13.

For the iconographie connection between Ganymede and Saint John the Evangelist, and Sebastiano's "good joke," see Panofsky, "The Neoplatonic Movement," 212-16. Saslow ( Ganymede in the Renaissance, 51) observed that Sebastiano's recommendation "hints at a deliberate camouflage of the original reference." In a letter to Michelangelo of November 1545, Pietro Aretino complained that the artist had failed to send him a requested drawing, advising that by doing what he promised, "you would have silenced all those spiteful tongues, who say that only certain Gherardos and Tommasos can obtain them," referring to Cava- lieri and Gherardo Perini, an earlier beloved of Michelangelo; quoted by Saslow, ibid., 48-49. 17.

Ramsden's translation: "Messer Tommao, my dear lord - Although I have not answered your last letter, I do not believe that you believe that I had forgotten, or could forget, the food on which I live, which is none other than your name."

See Popham and Wilde, The Italian Drawings, cat. no. 431. Hirst's sugges- tion ( Michelangelo and His Drawings, 111-12) that Vasari listed the four compositions in their order of execution yields a likely sequence. Most scholars agree that the Ganymede and Tityus were the two sent to Cava- lieri in the last days of 1532. The first two versions of The Fall of Phaeton are thought to date from before June 1533; the Windsor version had been received by September 6, 1533, when Tommaso wrote a letter of acknowledgment. The Children's Bacchanalhas been dated just after the Phaeton on formal/ technical grounds (Johannes Wilde, in Popham and Wilde, cat. no. 431; and Hirst, Michelangelo and His Drawings, 116) and, since it was copied by Raffaello da Montelupo in Florence in 1533 (see n. 41 below), the Bacchanal was presumably executed there before Michelangelo returned to Rome in October 1533. Of the four drawings certainly given to Cavalieri, all but the Bacchanal are drawn in black chalk. Among the possible Cavalieri gift drawings, The Archers and The Labors of Hercules are also in red chalk. 20. The drawing's close-knit structure and overall textural unity led Wilde (in Popham and Wilde, The Italian Drawings, no. 431) to compare it to an engraving, while Hirst ( Michelangelo and His Drawings, 73, 113) cited this drawing as a prime example of Michelangelo's technique of strok- ing chalk over a grained paper surface to produce the granular effect. For a fuller discussion of this technique, see William E. Wallace, "Studies in Michelangelo's Finished Drawings, 1527-1534" (PhD diss., Columbia University, 1983), esp. 62ff. 21. Vasari, Le vite (Florence, 1550), 986: "una baccanaria, che col fiato non si farebbe più d'unione," here translated in Wilde's graceful phrase ( Six Lectures, 156). 22. Panofsky ("The Neoplatonic Movement," 223) deemed the drawing "entirely devoid of amorous tension," lacking hilarity or humor, with the satyress presenting "deadly torpor." Kirschenbaum, "Reflections on Michelangelo's Drawings," 106; and von Einem, Michelangelo, 137. For Wilde (Six Lectures, 153-56), the "putti represent functions of life at its lowest level."

Dempsey distin- guishes the Renaissance spiritello from the nude child (putto) in antique art, who might or might not represent love. Spiritelli appear in Dona- tello's reliefs on the Florentine Duomo Cantoria, the Prato pulpit, and the base of the Judith. 28. For this antique quotation in the Bacchanal and others given here, I am indebted to Pamela Askew's perceptive initial researches. For the former sarcophagus, now in the British Museum, London, see Bober and Rubinstein, Renaissance Artists, no. 83; and for the latter, ibid., no. 81, and fig. 69a for the free copy/ variant reproduced here.

Alexander Nagel, "Gifts for Michelangelo and Vittoria Colonna," Art Bulletin 79, no. 4 (1997): 658-59, notes Michelangelo's referencing of Raphael's Entombment in the Children's Bacchanal and in a drawing in the Musée Bonnat, Bayonne, for a Lamentation. The reverse of the Bayonne drawing contains a preliminary sketch for the Children 's Bacchanal, dis- cussed below (Fig. 9). 31. These connections were pointed out by Panofsky, "The Neoplatonic Movement," 221-22. 32.

The Royal Collection's online catalog entry (http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/ collection/912777 /a-childrens-bacchanal, adapted from The Art of Italy in the Royal Collec- tion: Renaissance and Baroque [London: Royal Collection, 2007] ) asserts that the drawing embodies a "standard Neoplatonic theme," in which the "semi-animal" behavior of the children and satyress signifies "the lowest state of humanity," while the drunken sleeper may warn Cavalieri "about the perils of drink." 34. Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, Oration on the Dignity of Man (1486), quoted and discussed in Ernst Cassirer, P. O. Kristeller, and J. H.

Also quoted by Alexander Nagel, Michelangelo and the Reform of Art (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 95ff., who explores the connection between ecstatic drunkenness and Christ's Pas- sion; and cited by Maria Ruvoldt, The Italian Renaissance Imagery of Inspi- ration: Metaphors of Sex, Sleep, and Dream (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 25, who rightly sees the implication for artistic creativity. I am indebted to Ruvoldt's illumination of many Italian Renaissance images in light of these ideas, which clearly pertain to the Children 's Bacchanal. 35.

On Bacchus 's ability to strike the right balance, see Luba Freedman, "Michelangelo's Reflections on Bacchus," Artibus et Historiae 24, no. 47 (2003): 126. The apparent drunk- enness of Michelangelo's Bacchus, unusual in its time among freestand- ing images of the god, may have caused its patron Cardinal Raffaele Riario to reject it, according to Ralph Lieberman, who discusses the stat- ue's intentionally destabilized formal composition; Lieberman, "Regarding Michelangelo'^ Bacchus," Artibus et Historiae 22, no. 43 (2001): 65-74. 39. See Charles de Tolnay, Corpus, vol. 2, no. 337v, who dates the drawing 1525-30. Panofsky ("The Neoplatonic Movement," 221) connected the imagery of the Bacchanal and the Bayonne drawing with Titian's Worship of Venus and Bacchanal of theAndrians, which Michelangelo would have seen when in Ferrara in 1529. However, a putto urinating into a dish appears in a Michelangelo drawing from perhaps a decade earlier; see Pauljoannides, The Drawings of Michelangelo and His Followers in the Ash- molean Museum (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007), cat. no. 66. Joannides unconvincingly suggests that the Bayonne drawing was a study for a putative Bacchanal for Alfonso d'Este's Camerino, invited in competition with Titian. 40. He resembles the reclining river god in two of the Fall of Phaeton draw- ings (British Museum and Windsor). All these are related to the river gods projected for the Medici Chapel; see Tolnay, Michelangelo, vol. 3, 46-47. 41. A drawing by Raffaello da Montelupo in the Ashmolean Museum, described by Joannides, The Drawings of Michelangelo, as a copy of the Children 's Bacchanal, in fact repeats selected figures and groups in the composition, which vary in their fidelity to the poses. Cf. Raffaello's even looser and more selective copy of the Fall of Phaeton (Popham and Wilde, The Italian Drawings, cat. no. 787v, fig. 151). 42.

Plato pre- sented the idea of creative furor in the Timaeusr, for Ficino's amplification of it, see n. 35 above. 44. Examples cited by Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 102 (Pon tano and Dürer), and idem, Italian Renaissance Imagery, 21 (Bembo). In Purgatorio, canto 9, lines 16-18, Dante writes of the dreams of the last hours of sleep, which produce visions almost divine; cited by David Summers, Michelangelo and the Language of Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981), 488-89 n. 40. 45. On Michelangelo's view of fecund night as the source of creative inven- tion, expressed in a set of poems, see David Summers, "Form and Gen- der," New Literary History 24 (1993): 243-71; Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 102; Buck, Michelangelo' s Dream, 21-22; and Mary D. Garrard, Brunelleschi' s Egg: Nature, Art and Gender in Renaissance Italy (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2010), 268-69. The poem that most clearly links the artist's self-identification with both night and melan- choly is Saslow, The Poetry of Michelangelo, no. 104, also quoted by Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 102. On the artist's identification with night via the mask that accompanies Notte in the Medici Chapel, see John Paoletti, "Michelangelo's Masks," Art Bulletin 74, no. 3 (1992): 423- 40; and in a more broadly Neoplatonic and Orphic context, Francesco Gandolfo, Il "dolce tempo": Mistica, ermetismo e sogno nel cinquecento (Rome: Bulzoni, 1978), 113-38. 46. Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 102, gives examples, with an empha- sis on Michelangelo's ability to interpret dreams and his apparent belief that his own dreams were prophetic. 47. Michelangelo to Luigi del Riccio, 1538-39, in Michelangelo, Carteggio, vol. 4, no. 958. 48. Michelangelo to Vasari, September 28, 1555, in ibid., vol. 5, no. 1215, cited by Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 103. In a briefer letter to his nephew Lionardo, written on the same day (Carteggio, vol. 5, no. 1214), Michelangelo used the phrase "like a dream" to describe his idea for the library, then repeated it in his letter to Vasari. 49. "In painting, the idea is an image that the intellect of the painter has to see with interior eyes in the greatest silence and secrecy. This he must imagine and select from the most excellent and rare things that his imagination and prudence may attain, as an exemplar dreamt or seen in the sky or elsewhere." Francisco de Hollanda, Da pintura antiga, ed. Angel Gonzalez Garcia (Lisbon: Imprensa Nacional-Casa de Moeda, 1984), 95, trans. Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 103. For the proba- bility that Francisco accurately recorded Michelangelo's thoughts on this subject and for fuller discussion of fantasia, or the artist's power to envision, see Summers, Michelangelo and the Language of Art, chap. 14, esp. 217-33. 50. For the "circumstantial evidence" that the Sogno was made for Cavalieri, see Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 93. Winner ("Michelangelo's II Sogno," 227-42) observed that Vasari was probably the first to give the drawing a tide and suggested (n. 13) that Vasari may have meant the word sogno to refer to the "imaginative invention of the artist," citing a seicento analogy of fantastic drawings that were called sogni to mean "capriccio" or "fantasia." 51. Hieronymus Tetius, a seventeenth-century visitor to the Barberini Pal- ace, offered this interpretation of the drawing, which was essentially sus- tained by Panofsky ("The Neoplatonic Movement," 223-25). Ruvoldt ("Michelangelo's Dream," 86) gives details. 52. Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 90-91, 99-100. 53. Ibid., 102. 54. Analogous in this respect is a later drawing of Christ on the Cross, where the head of Christ turns in pentimenti both left and right, suggesting that Michelangelo had not yet decided whether to have him turn to the Virgin or to Saint John. Joannides, Michelangelo and His Influence, no. 24. 55. According to Jeremy Taylor, Dream Work: Techniques for Discovering the Cre- ative Power in Dreams (New York: Paulist Press, 1983), 119, this was the insight of Fritz Perls and the Gestalt school. 56.

Freud's idea, elsewhere called "secondary elaboration,"</page><page sequence="24">MICHELANGELO IN LOVE: DECODING THE CHILDREN'S BACCHANAL 47 is also discussed by Barkan ( Michelangelo : A Life on Paper, 296-97) in an application of Freud's dream analysis to Michelangelo's working process that fortuitously parallels my own, which was initiated independently and developed before I saw his book. 57. Freud called the multiple meanings of a dream image "condensation" (Interpretation of Dreams, chap. 6, A). C. G.Jung emphasized the synthe- sizing work of the unconscious, which he termed "compensation." See Jung, Dreams, trans. R. F. C. Hull (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1974), 37ff., 101-4, 289ff. Jung's idea of "compensation" is explained clearly by Taylor, Dream Work, 128-32. 58.

Michelangelo's penchant for punning and double mean- ings is visible throughout his correspondence, for example, his pun on giudizio, meaning both an artist's judgment and the Last Judgment (see Summers, Michelangelo and the Language of Art, 370). On Michelangelo's verbal facility, see also Deborah Parker, Michelangelo and the Art of Letter Writing (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2010). 65. The sarcophagus (Bober and Rubinstein, Renaissance Artists, 70, fig. 27) was cited as Michelangelo's prototype by Buck (Michelangelo' s Dream, 124); and, earlier, by Craig Hugh Smyth, Mannerism and Maniera (Locust Valley, N.Y.: J.J. Augustin, 1963), 19, who ascribed the observa- tion to then-doctoral candidate Rosalind R. Grippl. 66. For the interpretation of the Phaeton as Michelangelo's mythological self-punishment for his attraction to Cavalieri, see Panofsky, "The Neo- platonic Movement," 218-20; Tolnay, Michelangelo, vol. 3, 114; Liebert, Michelangelo: A Psychoanalytic Study, 288; and Saslow, Ganymede in the Renaissance, 38. Taylor, Dream Work, 128, discusses "the ancient wisdom that 'a dream is a picture of a feeling.'" 67. In the Oxford English Dictionary (hereafter OED), 11th ed., the first definition of "oryx" is "a pickax," while the second is "a kind of antelope or gazelle, so called from its pointed horns." 68. Salvatore Battaglia, Grande dizionario della lingua italiana (Turin: Unione Tipografico-Editrice Torinese, 1961), vol. 12, 101, s.v. "orige." 69. The online OED, for example, defines oruxas "a pickaxe, hence applied to the animal." Conversely, recent excavations at Stonehenge revealed that red deer antler picks were used to excavate the site, ca. 3630-3375 BCE, some thousand years before the first stones were erected. John Noble Wilford, "Stonehenge Used as Cemetery from the Beginning," New York Times, May 30, 2008, "Science." 70. Curiously, the Italian word for the deer, orige or its variants, is not used to describe a pickax or stonemason's tool in any Renaissance documents I have examined. In the two instances Michelangelo mentioned "pickaxes" in correspondence, his word was pichone (Michelangelo, Carteggio, vol. 2, no. 286, May 1518, and no. 343, September 13-14, 1518). The words oryx, orige, and variants do not appear in the Vocabolario degli accademici della Crusca (Florence, 1612), nor in descriptions of sculptors' tools, such as that given by Vasari in the first section of the Vite . However, since the pickax was a tool for rough-quarrying stone, not for refined sculptural work, the word might have been used by stonemasons but not in literary texts. It is pertinent that Michelangelo's earliest years were spent with a stonemason's family in Settignano, where by his own account he was "suckled among the chisels and hammers of the stonecutters." 71. For the inscription on this drawing of ca. 1501-2 and its relation to the sculptor's tool, see Charles Seymour Jr., Michelangelo's David: A Search for Identity (Pittsburgh, 1967), 7-8; and Irving Lavin, "David's Sling and Michelangelo's Bow: A Sign of Freedom," in Past-Present: Essays on Histor- icism in Art from Donatello to Picasso (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), 29-61, esp. 31-36. * 72.

See Wolfgang Stechow, "Joseph of Arimathea or Nicodemus?" in Wal- lace, Michelangelo: Selected Scholarship, vol. 4, 195-216, and, for the sculp- ture connection, 206. The association of sculptors in particular with turbans is also seen in portraits of Donatello and other sculptors in Vasari's Lives-, see Paoletti, "Michelangelo's Masks," 432 n. 21. 74. For the portrait drawing of Michelangelo (Tolnay, Corpus, vol. 1, no. 118r) and related copies, see Ernst Steinmann, Die Portraitdarstellun- gen des Michelangelo (Leipzig: Klinkhardt und Biermann, 1913), 16-20, pls. 2-6. Leo Steinberg first identified the turbaned horseman at upper left of the Crucifixion of Saint Peter as a self-portrait. Steinberg, Michel- angelo's Last Paintings: The Conversion of St. Paul and the Crucifixion of St. Peter in the Cappella Paolina, Vatican Palace (New York: Oxford University Press, 1975), 54. Paoletti ("Michelangelo's Masks," 432-37, figs. 10, 12) further identifies turbaned figures in two Michelangelo drawings in the Ashmolean as self-portraits, and finds another in the Allegory of Pru- dence drawing discussed below (Fig. 22). 75. Michelangelo's opinion that the artist needed compasses in the eyes was reported by Vasari (in a letter to Martino Bassi of 1570) and later by G. P. Lomazzo. For these, see Summers, Michelangelo and the Language of Art, chap. 10, esp. 370-73, also chap. 6. On Michelangelo's view that "the world is blind," that is, lacks discerning judgment, see Saslow, The Poetry of Michelangelo, no. 109, and that his ability to discern beauty and harmo- nious proportions was given him at birth, see no. 164. See also Garrard, Brunelleschi' s Egg, 268. 76. The numbering of Michelangelo's poems here follows Saslow, The Poetry of Michelangelo. 77. Liebert's close scrutiny of the drawing led him to insist this was the case (Michelangelo: A Psychological Study, 289). At the least, the detail is sugges- tively ambiguous. 78. Panofsky ("The Neoplatonic Movement," 221) cites a "relatively 'idealistic' Silenus type in Renaissance art." 79. See Nagel, Michelangelo and the Reform of Art, 158-68, fig. 86, for the evo- lution of the Colonna composition from related Michelangelo drawings, including the Children 's Bacchanal, also, for discussion of Bacchic refer- ences in Michelangelo's images of Christ's Passion, see chaps. 3, 5. 80. The identification of Heraclitus as Michelangelo, first proposed in the modern literature by Deoclecio Redig de Campos ("Il pensieroso della Segnatura," in Michelangiolo Buonarroti nel TV centenario del * Giudizio Uni- versale" 1541-1941 [Florence: Sansoni, 1942], 205-19), has become an interpretative commonplace. See Rona Goffen, Renaissance Rivals: Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Titian (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002), 222-26. Maria H. Loh, "Renaissance Faciality," Oxford Art Journal 32 (2009) : 350-53, recently argued that the Michelangelo identification was invented by Redig de Campos, yet on the unconvincing grounds that no premodern documentary confirmation or "authorized" portrait source is known, and with no consideration of the visual connection between Heraclitus and the Sis tine Jeremiah. 81. Summers, Michelangelo and the Language of Art, 116-17, discusses the ancient and medieval roots of the connection between creative fantasia and melancholy, noting that some of the best early evidence for its con- nection with Michelangelo is visual, such as Raphael's image of Michel- angelo as Heraclitus, the "dark philosopher." As Summers observes, "such images no doubt partly describe Michelangelo's natural disposi- tion, but just as certainly the ideals they embody must also have helped to shape his character." 82. Saslow, The Poetry of Michelangelo; the former is no. 84, of about 1534. The latter is sonnet 151 (ca. 1538-44), which begins: "Non ha l'ottimo artista alcun concetto / c' un marmo solo in sé non circonscriva / col suo superchio." 83. Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 89-92, discusses Michelangelo's assertion of his melancholic nature in letters of the 1520s and his grow- ing reputation as melancholic. See also Piers Britton, "'Mio malincho- nico, o vero . . . mio pazzo": Michelangelo, Vasari, and the Problem of Artists' Melancholy in Sixteenth-Century Italy," Sixteenth Century Journal 34 (2003): 653-75. 84.

Michelangelo's complaint of abuse from his patrons began early and ran long. In another example from 1542, he grumbled that "painting and sculpture, hard work and fair dealing have been my ruin and things go continually from bad to worse. It would have been better had I been put to making matches in my youth" (Carteggio, vol. 4, no. 1000, trans. Ramsden, vol. 2, 226). 86. Saslow (The Poetry of Michelangelo, 27) identifies this theme in the poetry, giving examples.

Svetlana Alpers, The Making of Rubens (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995), chap. 3. In Virgil's sixth eclogue, the drunken Silenus is bound by two shepherds and a nymph, who mock him and make him sing. Alpers comments (108) that "this low figure, in his drunken, bound state, pours out mythic tales of creation, of love, and of death." See also Lisa Rosenthal, Gender, Politics, and Allegory in the Art of Rubens (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), 101-3, who extends Alpers's interpretation, and whose characterizations I quote here. 88.

For example, the Satyr Family bronze plaquette by Andrea Riccio, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., Samuel H. Kress Collection, 1957.14.262. More frequent was the family sired by a satyr from a human mother, whose children were also human. See Lynn Kaufmann, The Noble Savage: Satyrs and Satyr Families in Renaissance Art (Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1984). Panofsky ("The Neoplatonic Movement," 222, fig. 31) compared the Bacchanalwìth Piero di Cosimo's Discovery of Honey, but without contrasting their expressive tones. 90. In the prologue to Della pittura, Leon Battista Alberti writes: "Thus I believed, as many said, that Nature, the mistress of things, had grown old and tired. She no longer produced either geniuses or giants which in her more youthful and more glorious days she had produced so mar- velously and abundantly." Alberti, On Painting, trans. John R. Spencer (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1966), 39. 91. For amplification and examples, see Garrard, Brunelleschi' s Egg, 134-35, 267-68, and for Michelangelo's ideas about art's relation to nature, 266- 74. 92. The drawing, which measures 11 by 15Vè inches, was acquired by the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, in 1993 and is dated ca. 1530 on its Website. Michael Hirst, noting connections with the Children's Bacchanal on both recto and verso (which shows a group of putti playing) , placed the Holy Family sheet at the time of the Bacchanals execution.

On the condemnation of homosexuality as unnatural, or "against nature," by preachers such as Bernardino of Siena and Savonarola, see Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, 41, 46, and passim; and dall'Orto, '"Socratic Love,"' esp. 47-48. The term contra naturamwas used by medieval theo- logians and poets (see Garrard, Brunelleschi's Egg, 26, 27), and in Greek, para phusis, by the Apostle Paul (Romans 1). 95. A third object is faintly outlined; this was turned into a round vessel by copyists, but its shape was not determined in the Windsor drawing. 96. For discussion of the Dionysian sacrificial rite in different periods of antiquity, see Carl Kerényi, Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life, trans.

See Fritz Saxl, "Pagan Sacrifice in the Italian Renaissance," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 2 (1939): 346-67, for examples of ways that Renaissance artists incorporated pagan sacrifice imagery. 98.

See Saslow, The Poetry of Michelangelo, no. 63, where fire metaphors play on properties of stone, for example, flint makes a spark, and marble is burned to make the lime used in mortar. 100. Kerényi, Dionysos, 250-61, describes the Dionysian boiling ritual and its variations. That the Roman relief shows a boar, not goat, sacrifice exem- plifies the alteration of the Greek Dionysian pot-boiling ritual in other cultures, just as the Dionysian ritual itself partook of older cross-cultural practices, for example, the ancient Egyptian ritual killing of the sacred pig identified with Osiris. See Sir James G. Frazer, The Golden Bough : A Study in Magic and Religion (London: Macmillan, 1957), vol. 2, chap. 49, for different animal forms taken by a range of prehistoric deities. 101. E. O.James, Origins of Sacrifice: A Study in Comparative Religion (London: John Murray, 1933), 177, pointed out that to drink Christ's blood is to assimilate the life principle.

Walker, The Woman' s Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1983), s.v. "Boar." 102. The cast-off skin metaphor recurs in nos. 51, 161. Steinberg, Michel- angelo's Last Paintings, 39-40, discussed Michelangelo's images of sloughed skin as a sign of spiritual renewal, linking them to Dante's description of the butterfly bursting free of its shroudlike cocoon, a favorite passage of the sculptor. 103. The embedded self-portrait in the Last Judgment's hanging skin as meta- phor for Michelangelo's desired redemption of his unworthy self is dis- cussed by many writers, including Edgar Wind, Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance (New York: W. W. Norton, 1968), 186-90; Leo Steinberg, "Michelangelo's 'Last Judgment' as Merciful Heresy," Art in Američanů (1975): 48-63; and Bernadine Barnes, Michelangelo' s Last Judgment: The Renaissance Response (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998), 102-6. The new life that follows Michelangelo's sloughing off of his old skin is found in a more hidden counterpart of the self-image in Saint Bartholomew's skin: the self-portrait at the top of the Last Judgment, where, as Frederick Hartt pointed out, he shows his resurrected self in heaven. Hartt, "Michelangelo in Heaven," Artibus et Historiae 13, no. 26 (1992): 191-209. 104. On these two prints, see Bernadine Barnes, Michelangelo in Print: Repro- ductions as Response in the Sixteenth Century (Farnham, U.K.: Ashgate, 2010), 64-65. Vico's engraving, which is dated 1546 and reproduces the drawing in reverse, was presumed by Adam von Bartsch {Le peintre graveur, vol. 15, 260) to have preceded that of Beatrizet, which restores the original orientation. The engravings indicate that the Windsor draw- ing was originally a little wider on each side; the truncated figures at far left and far right are fully visible in both prints. 105. Dempsey, Inventing the Renaissance Putto, 96-106, discusses this drawing of putti playing with a Silenus mask and gives other examples of larvate erotesr, see also Jane Martineau, ed., Andrea Mantegna, exh. cat., Royal Academy of Arts (London: Thames and Hudson, 1992), 457-58, no. 149. On Michelangelo's lost drawing and its copies, see Paoletti, "Michelangelo's Masks," 434-38; Paul Barolsky, The Faun in the Garden: Michelangelo and the Poetic Origins of Italian Renaissance Art (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1994), 9-12; and Buck, Michel- angelo' s Dream, no. 16. 106. Winner, "Michelangelo's II Sogno," 232, cites the association of the Latin word larva with both masks and malevolent spirits of the dead, interpret- ing the mask in the Sogno 21s a metaphor for death (239) . Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," connects the masks of the Sogno instead with the iconography of deceit. 107. According to Saslow, The Poetry of Michelangelo, no. 98, the poem's date is uncertain, but it has been placed close to the Tityus drawing because of its imagery. 108. Ludwig Goldschneider, Michelangelo Drawings (Greenwich, Ct., 1951), no. 49, identifies it as an "Oriental headdress." Howard Hibbard, Michelangelo (New York: Harper and Row, 1974), 189, called the headdress "fantastic"; Joannides, The Drawings of Michelangelo, cat. no. 31, called it "exotic." Tol- nay, Corpus, vol. 2, 323r, linked the Ashmolean drawing with head studies that Michelangelo gave his friend Gherardo Perini in the 1520s, yet, as Michael Hirst points out, he also made head drawings for Cavalieri. Hirst, Michelangelo Draftsman, exh. cat. (Milan: Olivetti, 1988), cat. no. 23. 109. Documentation of the Cavalieri portrait is given in n. 7 above. Earlier scholars (Thode, Wilde) had tentatively connected Cavalieri with the Oxford drawing, and with a less finished study of the same or similar head at Windsor (inv. no. 12764r), a connection that is considered more fully by Schumacher ( Michelangelos Teste Divine, 178-85). See Summers, Michelangelo and the Language of Art, 203-17, for a reconciliation of Michelangelo's Cavalieri portrait with his dislike of portraiture. As explained by Vincenzo Danti in Platonic terms, Tommaso's beauty was considered Nature's perfect achievement, which the artist could do no better than record faithfully (Danti, Trattato, 1567, cited by Summers, 217). A vision of such natural beauty through Michelangelo's eyes is found in his second documented portrait, the British Museum drawing of Andrea Quaratesi, another young pupil-beloved of the artist. See Chapman, Michelangelo Drawings, 209-1 1 ; and Barkan, Michelangelo: A Life on Paper, 197-99. 110. Perrig, Michelangelo' s Drawings, 77-79, identified both the Oxford and Windsor drawings as portraits of Tommaso de' Cavalieri, but unconvinc- ingly attributed both drawings to Cavalieri himself. Schumacher, Michel- angelos Teste Divine, 178-82, rejects Perrig's attribution of the drawing to Tommaso yet accepts the idea that the drawings represent Cavalieri, as the embodiment of Michelangelo's ideal of beauty. 111. Saslow, The Poetry of Michelangelo, no. 98: "Se vint' e preso i' debb'esser beato, / maraviglia non è se nudo e solo / resto prigion d'un cavalier armato." 112. Joannides, The Drawings of Michelangelo, cat. no. 62, making no connec- tion with Cavalieri, dates the Oxford Ideal Head about 1630 rather than the early 1620s proposed by others, pointing out its resemblance to the Victory in type, elegance, and delicacy. Perrig, Michelangelo' s Drawings, 77-79, noted the resemblance of the two drawings to the sculptural head of Giuliano de' Medici, arguing further that Michelangelo lent the features of his beloved to the head of Giuliano. 113. Panofsky ("The Neoplatonic Movement," 218) dated it 1532-34; and Tolnay ( Michelangelo , vol. 4, 59-60, 112) ca. 1531-32. Conversely, Johannes Wilde ("Michelangelo's 'Victory,'" in Wallace, Michelangelo: Selected Scholarship, vol. 3, 437-58) dated the Victory to 1527-30, and thus before Michelangelo met Tommaso. John Pope-Hennessy ( Italian High Renaissance and Baroque Sculpture [London: Phaidon, 1963], cat. vol., 24); and Hibbard ( Michelangelo , 202-6) similarly dated the sculpture before the Cavalieri period, explicitly rejecting a connection with him. 114. Martin Weinberger, Michelangelo the Sculptor (New York: Columbia Uni- versity Press, 1967), vol. 1, 253-69, proposed that the Victory was begun in June 1533, when, complying with the new contract of 1532 that called</page><page sequence="26">MICHELANGELO IN LOVE: DECODING THE CHILDREN'S BACCHANAL 4g for a simple wall tomb, Michelangelo decided to create new double- figure compositions to fill the two niches, rather than using the Louvre Slaves. Edith Balas, "Michelangelo's Victory. Its Rôle and Significance," Gazette des Beaux-Arts 113 (1989) : 67-80, reprinted in Wallace, Michelan- gelo: Selected Scholarship, vol. 3, 459-72, proposed that the Victory was not intended for the Julius Tomb but instead was carved by Michelangelo in 1532-34 as a private work inspired by Cavalieri, while he pretended to work on the tomb. 115. Michelangelo to Bartolommeo Angelini, July 1533, trans. Ramsden, Let- ters of Michelangelo, vol. 1, 195; and Michelangelo, Carteggio, vol. 4, no. 908: "Però, se io desidero come senza alcuna intermessione, giorno e n[octe] , di esser costà, non è per altro che per tornare in vita, la qual cosa non può esser senza l'anima; e perché il core è veramente la casa dell'anima, e essendo prima il mio nelle mani di colui a chi voi l'anima mia avete dacta, naturai forza era di ritornarlla al luogo suo." 116. Balas, "Michelangelo's Victory," 77, quoting Ficino, Commentary on Plato' s Symposium, 144-45. 117. Patricia Simons, "Manliness and the Visual Semiotics of Bodily Fluids in Early Modern Culture , " Journal of Medieval and Early Modern Studies 39 (2009): 331-73. 118. These include an anonymous north Italian engraving, a drawing by Marco Zoppo, a miniature, and several other quattrocento drawings and prints; see ibid., 345-47. 119. Simons (ibid., 356) notes that the Italian verb rìdere, "to laugh" or "to smile," also connoted sexual acts, particularly sodomy. 120. See Saslow, The Poetry of Michelangelo, 32, for the quoted phrase and dis- cussion of Michelangelo's ambivalence about his own sexuality. In poem no. 58 especially, Michelangelo insists to Cavalieri that his desire is chaste, despite what others have said. Saslow, "'A Veil of Ice,"' probes the question of the role of physical sex in Michelangelo's emotional attachments. 121. Taylor, Dream Work, 165, 220.

Nagel, Michelangelo and the Reform of Art, 162, recognized that the Children' s Bacchanalia concerned with sacrifice and regeneration, yet he, too, viewed it as a single Neoplatonic stratum, the entire image said to represent a "lower zone" of "sacrifice and dark stirring, a deathly realm that feeds and makes possible the regions of light" (presumably to be found elsewhere) . 125. In speech VI, chap. 15, Ficino describes the steps by which Diotima leads Socrates "from the lowest things to the highest," a progression from material existence in nature to divine spiritual beauty (Ficino, Commen- tary on Plato's Symposium, 136-38). For the broadly Neoplatonic pro- grams of both the original Julius Tomb and the Medici Chapel, see Tolnay, Michelangelo, vol. 3, 63-75, vol. 4, 23-25. 126. Buck, Michelangelo' s Dream, no. 16, connects this drawing with the recently published Narrenschiff, or Ship of Fools, by Sebastian Brant, in which human weakness and sin are denounced as foolishness, overcome by a prudent man. 127. Prudence is represented in the fifteenth-century allegorical engravings, the so-called Mantegna Tarocchi, with the double face of a young woman and old man's mask. See Barolsky, The Faun in the Garden, 9-12, for this interpretation and for his perceptive discussion of Michel- angelo's ironic self-mocking in poetry and other drawings. 128.

To name a few examples: in Christine de Pizan's Cité des Dames, the despairing author is fortified by the arrival of a female allegorical trium- virate, Ladies Reason, Rectitude, and Justice; in Giotto's Arena Chapel, Enrico Scrovegni presents his chapel to the three Marys, to expiate his sins; in the Triumph of Death in the Camposanto, Pisa, the corntly pro- cession encounters three coffins.

Benjamin Nelson (New York: Harper and Row, 1958), 63-75. 130. Nagel, Michelangelo and the Reform of Art, 161, gives Michelangelo's refer- ence to the "Bed of Polycleitus" relief a religious significance, connect- ing it with the Man of Sorrows theme. For the relief and its copies, see Bober and Rubinstein, Renaissance Artists, no. 94. It is not clear whether the reliefs subject was known in the Renaissance. 131.

Ruvoldt, "Michelangelo's Dream," 105, cites the relevant sonnets (nos. 260, 166) in which Michelangelo speaks of the tension between physical and spiritual love and applies them to the Sogno. 134. For the literature, see ibid., 109 n. 4. 135. Ibid., 99-101, 103-7. 136. Saslow, The Poetry of Michelangelo, no. 87.
