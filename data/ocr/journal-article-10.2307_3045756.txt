ANDERSON AND CHRISTINE MULLEN KREAMER, Wild Spirits Strong Medicine: African Art and the Wilderness, University of Washington Press, Seattle, with the Center for African Art, New York, 1989. Pp. 152; 145 ills., 130 in color. $37.50 Since its opening in 1985, the Center for African Art in New York City has been responsible for a wide range of exhibition cata- logues on diverse aspects of African art. Although of varying scholarly merit, the Center's publications have often been distin- guished by the lavishness of their photographic production and their exploration of timely themes. Wild Spirits Strong Medicine: African Art and the Wilderness, by Martha G. Anderson and Christine Mullen Kreamer, is at once one of the most thematically provocative and visually rich of these publications. The catalogue is divided into three parts: an introduction by Enid Schildkrout, an anthropologist who is also listed as the volume's editor; the main text by Martha G. Anderson and Christine Mullen Kreamer; and photographs of exhibited sculptures with short captions by Carol Thompson of the Center for African Art. The insightful and thought-provoking introduction by Schild- krout provides us with the historical background of anthropolog- ical theories concerning the wilderness espoused by a number of "armchair anthropologists," such as Sir James Frazer, E.B. Tylor, and W. Robertson Smith. As Schildkrout notes, "The tradition of the early synthesists never totally died out . . ." (p. 14), and anthropologists such as Mary Douglas, Edmund Leach, Jack Goody, and Clifford Geertz have continued to refine the theo- retical parameters of associated debates. She goes on to discuss related concerns of modes of production and the grounding of associated questions around ideas of "self" and "other." Noting the distinction made in African societies between views of forest beings and perceptions of water spirits, she observes (p. 20): What we seem to have here are two kinds of strangers: those of the bush or wilderness which threaten orderly village life in a settled agricultural society; and those of the water which are associated with social change and potential enhancement of ex- isting society. This contrast is based on a concrete reality: while the bush obviously threatens the village with wild animals, weeds, disease, and other familiar dangers, the foreigners and goods that arrive from beyond the oceans insidiously change culture by substituting foreign values and promising new kinds of wealth. The reality of foreign influence drifts in slowly, al- lowing people the illusion of control, but in fact, the siren song of the water spirits may in the long run cause greater destruc- tion to traditional African civilization than the most powerful and angry spirit of the bush. Similar dichotomies are important to the understanding of the larger significance of the "wild spirit" theme in African art. The text of the catalogue, written jointly by Anderson and Kreamer, is divided into five chapters titled simply: "Wilderness," "Space," "Denizens of the Wild," "Diviners, Healers and Hunt- ers," and "Power." In these chapters, the authors elaborate on the varying ways in which African views of "the wilderness" and be- liefs concerning it find expression in the art. As Anderson and Kreamer suggest (p. 23): Beliefs about the wilderness are reflected upon in many African systems of thought and then expressed in social action: in art, in ritual performances, in language, and even in the organi- zation of space. . . . The intellectual construct of nature/cul- ture or wilderness/village is useful for it gives insights into Af- rican concepts of civilization.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 511 The first chapter, "Wilderness," looks at the ways in which an- thropologists and other scholars have explored the concept of "wilderness" and "civilization" in recent years. Chapter two fo- cuses on the village/wilderness dichotomy and how this is ex- pressed in spatial organization and personal adornment. Chapter three takes up the role of religious forces that mediate between village and wilderness. This chapter also compares descriptions of wilderness beings with their representations in art. The crossing of boundaries between village and wilderness in the context of particular activities, such as divining, healing, and hunting, is the subject of chapter four. Chapter five discusses how those in po- sitions of political power use wilderness themes. Anderson and Kreamer are to be congratulated for the wealth of material covered in their writing. The field photographs also have been selected well. Nonetheless, there are several problems with their text. First is the question of the organization of the material and the clarity of the exposition. Though the text ranges broadly through the sources, there is little within each chapter that binds the material together. One reads that "A" group does this, "B" group believes that, "C" group maintains thus and so. It is not clear why certain African cultures were selected for in- clusion in the analysis and not others, and why the authors have chosen to discuss them in the particular order selected. More to the point, all the included cultures, arts, and ideas are given equal weight, so that it is very difficult for the reader to discern issues of special significance. Throughout, one wishes for an authorative voice to articulate a sense of "forest" through the many "trees." Certain chapters stand out as more successful than others. The exploration of how boundaries between wilderness and civiliza- tion are crossed is effectively treated in chapter four. Chapter five (on power), on the other hand, suffers from the inclusion of nu- merous disparate topics: "Blacksmiths," "Animals and Witches," "Power Images in Ceremonies," "Emblems of Authority in De- centralized Societies," and "Emblems of Authority in Centralized Societies." Never do the authors raise the issue of how political structures specifically affect perceptions of the nature/culture di- chotomy. And one culture group, the Cameroon Grasslands, is discussed as both a decentralized society and a centralized king- ship. Chapter two, "Space," is also served poorly in the text. Not only have the authors left out nearly all the major works on Af- rican architecture, but they have also failed to articulate the cen- tral ways in which categories of wilderness and civilization are blurred in architectural traditions and related conceptualizations of space. No mention is made of the fact that features of the wil- derness are frequently introduced into both the house and the village's communal spaces. Likewise, the forests are periodically "civilized," or tamed, through seasonal offerings, rituals, and fires. One also wonders why "space" and "personal adornment" have been joined together in this chapter; the topics of space and adorn- ment may share key features, but they are not explored here. A second and related difficulty with the text concerns the ques- tion of its historical and theoretical framing. The brief section of chapter one that presents the central issues of the wilderness and civilization (pp. 24-26) is inadequate. Though much of the focus in this section is on anthropological writings, little in-depth crit- ical evaluation is devoted to these works; indeed, a far better theoretical overview appears in Schildkrout's introduction. In the final analysis, one wants to know what the authors think about these matters. As art historians, how do they situate themselves within the larger anthropological and structuralist discourse, and how do they answer recent critiques of structuralist theory? In addition, Anderson and Kreamer made little attempt to de- fine their argument with respect to earlier art-historical writings on wilderness themes. Missing from the introductory theory sec- tion of their text, for example, is any reference to the book of 1974 edited by Douglas Fraser on the subject of dichotomies in African art. The essays in Fraser's African Art as Philosophy treat a range of similar topics drawn from structuralist theory (Nature/ Culture, Creative/Destructive, Beauty/Beast - to name but a few). Fraser's edited volume constitutes the first real discussion of these issues by an African art historian; thus Wild Spirits Strong Medicine in some respects represents a missed opportunity to move the topic forward. Also absent from the authors' analysis is any mention of the well-known "wildman" traditions in West- ern art history. As a result, Wild Spirits Strong Medicine is never situated within that long-standing art-historical discourse. To their credit, Anderson and Kreamer do make a brief stab at theory on their own in the suggestion that there may be an underlying correlation between beliefs about the wilderness and the means of economic production. The authors argue the point this way (pp. 23-24): Beliefs in nature spirits and the powers of the wilderness may be, in part, a response to economic uncertainties as these settled peoples struggle, technologically and symbolically, to manage the environment. Hunters and gatherers, in contrast, do not try to control their environment to any great extent; their economic systems adapt to fluctuations in the environment. Pastoralists also move over their environment and are not very concerned with maintaining fixed boundaries between their settlements and the world outside. Not surprisingly, pastoralists, hunters, and gatherers do not have the same attitude to the forest, grass- land, or wilderness as do the settled peoples who are our subject here. To those familiar with African anthropological literature, this statement will be viewed as far too general and simplistic to offer any real insight. Nonetheless, it is too bad that Anderson and Kreamer do not explore further the issue of modes of economic production in their text. It is in responding to questions such as this that the larger significance of the wilderness/civilization di- chotomy in Africa may lie. A number of related questions also remain unasked. For example, does the environment of a culture affect in substantial ways the framing of questions raised by that culture about wilderness and civilization? What is the larger im- pact of a culture's political structure on related wilderness/civi- lization issues? Do societies living in cities and those in dispersed settlement patterns share similar values? Do matrilineality or pa- trilineality make any difference? Do those societies whose econ- omies are grounded in commerce, fishing, or craft production rather than agriculture or hunting/gathering have the same views as those discussed here7 Also left generally unexplored are key issues such as paradox, conflict, contradiction, and conflation, which are an inherent part of any related analysis. The shifting concerns with zoomorphism and anthropomorphism in African origin myths also need to be explored further. The issue of historiographical grounding is also central to this discussion. Nearly all the African sources cited in the catalogue's bibliography were written after 1960. Although the authors sug- gest (p. 24) that "no one [previously] has systematically surveyed the existing literature on Africa to draw general conclusions" on this subject, their overwhelming bias toward recent sources and those in English also presents problems. Readers may be left won- dering why earlier writings and French or German texts generally have been excluded. This is important because the wilderness/ civilization polemic was framed quite differently by scholars studying African cultures in the prestructuralist era of anthro- pological writing. There were also important differences in var-</page><page sequence="3">512 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1990 VOLUME LXXII NUMBER 3 ious European schools of thought on related issues. Also of in- terest in this light is how views of civilization and wilderness have changed as a result of extensive European or Islamic influence in various African areas. Furthermore, one is curious about the ways that early European myths about Africa - as an impenetrable "wilderness" peopled with a variety of strange "tailed" and "hairy" human denizens - have influenced associated beliefs and schol- arship both past and present. The third part of the catalogue is composed of photographs of the objects presented in the exhibit. There is, unfortunately, little real correlation between this section and the main text. Although references are made in the margins of the Anderson and Kreamer essay to the objects whose photographs appear in the last section, none of these works is specifically mentioned or treated in the text. Chapter two, on space, for example, is illustrated with a variety of Lega sculptures, which are never mentioned in this chapter. Chapter three, in turn, is illustrated primarily with ob- jects of the Ijaw of Nigeria and various Burkina Faso groups. Though the Ijaw water spirit masks are discussed in a section of this chapter, the rich Burkina Faso traditions are explored by the authors only in a subsequent chapter. Chapter four, in turn, while referring to a range of cultures and arts, is illustrated only with Songye examples. Cameroon Grasslands sculptures, which are illustrated in conjunction with chapter five, in turn are treated only summarily in the associated text. The lack of correlation between the exhibition objects and the text is also evidenced in the substantial errors that appear in the cross-referencing between the two sections. Beside a paragraph discussing Gourmantche (Burkina Faso) concepts of the wilder- ness (p. 30), we find a notation to look at catalogue entries 24- 60, which constitute instead a range of sculptures from the Lega of Zaire. Likewise, on p. 78, in a discussion of Kuba (Zaire) sym- bols of power, we see a reference to catalogue number 13, which turns out to be a vessel of the Asante of Ghana. For illustrations of the arts from the Benin kingdom of Nigeria (p. 77), we are directed to catalogue entries 86, 87, 92, all three of which are Songye figures from Zaire. And, on page 76, it is suggested that we look at catalogue number 28 for a view of a Kwele gon mask from Gabon; instead, we find a hat of the Lega of Zaire. It is important to note as well the lack of information in associated captions on the earlier collection histories of these objects. The dates when they first entered Western collections are not indicated either. The brief explanation on page 81 that all works date from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century is not a viable substitute for such collection history data. In view of the lack of a clear correlation between the catalogue text and the objects exhibited, the reader may question how par- ticular sculptures were selected for inclusion. No answer is clearly evident, but at the beginning of the catalogue, on the same page as the names of the current Center for African Art donors, is a listing of lenders to the exhibition. A quick tally of donors and lenders suggests a very close connection between the two, one that is evidently being promoted by the printing of the two lists side by side. Is there a problem in this practice? In the end, prob- ably not, since the choice of objects exhibited may be dictated in part by what works were available as loans, but implicit in this practice is the possibility that key decisions concerning object se- lection are undertaken with an eye as much toward fund-raising as toward the cohesiveness of a particular catalogue (and exhibition). In the end, Anderson and Kreamer are able to convince the reader both of the importance of African conceptions of wilder- ness and civilization and of the variant ways in which these cat- egories are intentionally blurred. And, in turn, many of the ex- hibited works are visually striking examples of related themes. Yet many readers will be left unsatisfied, knowing that previous scholars have written more thoroughly and thoughtfully about this polarity both in Africa and in other parts of the world. These readers may in turn ask whether this catalogue really has moved them toward a clearer understanding of the central issues of the wilderness/civilization discourse.
