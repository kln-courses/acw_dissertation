Anyone who knows the contemporary literature on divine suffering will be familiar with (some variants of) the following picture of its emergence. Divine impassibility is utterly unknown to the Old Testament, and in the New TestamentJesus's suffering reveals the true face of God as a suffering God. Within a Hellenistic environment with its axiom of divine impassibility, this was an indigestible truth. Generally, the orthodox church fathers sub mitted to the dictates of Hellenism. There were some exceptions, however, most notably those of the Patripassianists (monarchic modalists), Origen at his best moments (esp. his sermon on Ezechiel 16), his pupil Gregorius Thaumaturgus, Lactantius, and the Theopaschites, who in various ways kept the Biblical truth that God is a suffering God alive.1 Their views were either suppressed and forgotten or declared heretic.2 Looking back from I Some would also add gnostic Manichaeism with its pivotal doctrine of the passi ble Jesus (Jesus patibilis) here. See, e.g., J. van Oort, 'Manichaismus,' in: RGG4 Vol. 5 (Tiubingen 2002), 732-741, 737. 2 This is the picture that emerges from the classic work byJ.K.

In the Middle Ages it no longer survived in official theology, but lived on in art,3 to emerge again in the theology of Martin Luther, and nineteenth- and espe cially twentieth-century British theology, from where it spread all over Christian theology. Altogether, we have here a rather romantic picture of a heroic struggle between good guys (the passibilists) and bad guys (the impassibilists), with the bad guys remaining in almost complete control over the good guys during nineteen centuries, and the good guys emerging vic torious in the twentieth century. As to the early church (because that is what concerns us here), patristic scholars have sounded notes of caution in several respects: modalism was not primarily about the suffering of the Father, but about strict monotheism vs. emerging trinitarianism; Origen's sermon on Ezechiel 16 is difficult to interpret in light of his other work;4 most of the Theopaschites defended the orthodox position that is questioned by contemporary passibilists, etc. These notes of caution, however, did not add up to a fully developed alter native interpretation of all we know about the doctrine of divine impassibility in the theology of the early church. This is the gap Paul Gavrilyuk aims to fill in his first book, a revised version of his Ph.D. thesis supervised by William S. Babcock. Gavrilyuk's alternative consists of two parts. On the one hand, he denies that divine impassibility was axiomatic in Hellenistic schools of thought. On the other hand, Gavrilyuk argues that it is time for a radical revision of our view of the debates on impassibility in the early church. Contrary to popular convictions, the heretics were the bad guys who were trying to impose divine impassibility on the orthodox fathers. These were the good guys who heroically defended the real suffering of the Logos against the attacks by the Docetists, the Arians and the Nestorians. Gavrilyuk broadly distinguishes between three positions: (1) those who main tain that God is utterly impassible: the Docetists, the Arians and the Nestorians; (2) those who keep the suffering and the impassibility of God of God, Cambridge 1926) and the Patristic attempt of process theologian J.M. Hallmann (The Descent of God, Minneapolis 1991). 3 See, e.g., F. Boespflug, 'La Compassion de Dieu le Pere dans l'art occidental (XIIIe_ XVIie siecles),' Le Supplinent: Revue d'Ethique et Theologie Morale 172 (Mars 1990), 123-159; M.-C.

Gavrilyuk, it will be clear, sympathizes with the orthodox church fathers. Their view, he argues, is Biblical: anti-anthropomorphic and anti-anthropopathic tendencies were present in the Bible already. It is quite clear that 'it is misleading to think of the patristic theological dilemma as involving a choice between the unemotional and uninvolved God of the Hellenes and the emotional and suffering God of the Hebrews' (46). Moreover, contrary to twentieth-century theological folklore, in the early church 'impassibility' functioned not as a positive attribute of God, denoting Him as static and indifferent, but as one of the negative qualifyers of apophatic theology, denying that God could be susceptible to the fluctuating affective states that are characteristic for human beings. For the fathers, impassibility was 'compatible with select emotionally coloured characteristics, e.g., love, mercy, and compassion' (48). These emotion-like states, however, can never take control of God; God is always in perfect control of them. The main part of the book, however, is devoted to the debates with the heretics who put the orthodox fathers under impassibilist pressure, and it is quite interesting to see how Gavrilyuk interprets these debates. In Chapter 3, Gavrilyuk takes off from the theology of martyrdom. Martyrs were not merely believed to partake in Christ's resurrection, but were also believed to share His suffering. Thus, the theological account of martyrdom pre supposed the reality of Christ's suffering. This was a problem for the Docetists, who on account of their strong views of divine impassibility denied the reality of Christ's suffering. The Docetists found it difficult to make sense of martyrdom, a difficulty that was exploited by the church fathers of the second and third centuries upholding the real suffering of Christ over against them. It was still unclear, however, in what way the suffering of Christ was to be related to the impassibility of God. A first step towards settling that issue was taken in the Patripassian controversy: it was the Son, not God the Father, who suffered in the Incarnation (Ch. 4).6 In Chapter 5, Gavrilyuk turns towards Arianism. Is Arianism a reaction to the understatement of Christ's involvement in the human condition by I Here, Gavrilyuk builds on the work of Thomas Weinandy (Does God Suffer?, Edinburgh 2000). 6 Cf. my 'Patripassianism and the Impassibility of God,' Svensk Teologisk Kvartalskrift 72 (1996), 73-81 (not discussed by Gavrilyuk).</page><page sequence="4">236 REVIEWS orthodox theology? Is God's suffering in Christ at the heart of Arian sote riology, as Maurice Wiles and R.P.C. Hanson have claimed? Gavrilyuk denies this, not only because he believes there was no reason whatsoever for a passibilist revolt against the orthodox position, but also because he doubts the Arian origin of a collection of anonymous Homilies on the Psalms, Wiles's main piece of evidence. In the end, Gavrilyuk argues, it is Arianism, with its denial of the fully divine status of Christ, that downplays the fact that Christ's suffering was God's suffering. Finally, in Chapter 6 Gavrilyuk argues that Nestorius developed his two-subjects Christology in an attempt to safeguard God's absolute impassibility, while Cyril of Alexandria started from the self-emptying of God and maintained the tension between suffering and impassibility in God. In response to the Nestorian accusation of theopatheia, he developed his theory of appropriation: 'The Word made human experiences his own by appropriating them from within: that which was violent, involuntary, tragically purposeless, and fatal for an ordinary human being was made voluntary, soteriologically purposeful, and life giving in the ministry of the Word' (175). Summarizing, Gavrilyuk provides an apology for what he terms the con sensus patrum. Though he is rather unfriendly about contemporary theolo gies of a suffering God, the interpretation Gavrilyuk gives of the theological developments in the early church can easily be appropriated by these. It enables them to present themselves as the inheritors not of a handful of heretics, but of the main tradition, completing the liberation of theology from the axiom of impassibility, a liberation that in the early church was impossible because of the pressure that came from the Docetists, the Arians and the Nestorians. Thus, the appeal of Gavrilyuk's reinterpretation may well be wider than he foresees. I should add to this that, on the whole, Gavrilyuk's interpretation of the theology of the patres and their opponents is more credible than rival interpretations like those by J.K. Mozley and J.M. Hallmann. Altogether, then, this is a timely and most welcome addi tion to the debate. That being said, the following criticisms remain. (1) There is a tension between Gavrilyuk's two main claims. On the one hand he denies that there was an axiom of impassibility, and on the other he claims that the Docetists, Arians and Nestorians defended the absolute impassibility of God, and the orthodox church fathers had to defend the suffering of the Logos against these. Generally, Gavrilyuk is more con vincing when he defends the second of these claims than when he defends the first, for which he provides very little argument. It tells against Gavrilyuk that he does not engage with the best literature on the axiom of impassi bility, e.g., Herbert Frohnhofen, Apatheia tou Theou: Uber die Affektlosigkeit Gottes</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 237 in der griechischen Antike und bei den griechischsprachigen Kirchenvatern bis zu Gregorius Thaumaturgus (New York 1987). This book is mentioned in one footnote only. After reading Gavrilyuk, I tend to accept his second claim, and to reject the first. (2) This brings me to a second criticism: he ignores not only Th. Kobusch and H. Frohnhofen, but also the highly relevant studies by W. Elert and Th. Ruither (misspelt by Gavrilyuk as Ruther) in German and by M. Feitsma in Dutch. He is aware of these; they are mentioned in the bibliography, but not discussed in the book. Generally speaking, Gavrilyuk limits himself to English literature and as a result fails to en gage with many important publications. (3) Not only Gavrilyuk's choice of secondary literature, but also his choice of primary sources can be criti cized. Favorite patristic proof-texts of twentieth-century passibilists like Origen's sermon on Ezechiel 16 and Gregorius Thaumaturgus's Ad Theopompum are completely ignored. (4) The earlier literature and Gavrilyuk share a distortion of the patristic material that should not go unnoticed. They all suggest that divine impassibility was a major issue in the first cen tury debates. I would argue that it was not. Divine impassibility was taken for granted, and was not one of the main focuses of debate in the early church. One can see this, for instance, from the fact that the only full length discussion of impassibility coming from the early church was Gregory Thaumaturgus's Ad Theopompum, which was soon forgotten until it was republished only in 1858. After that, the first monograph to appear on this topic was Marshall Randles, The Blessed God: Impassibiit_ (London 1900). That was the beginning of a series of books, to which nowadays new addi tions are made yearly. It is only when one looks back with the twentieth century debates and developments in mind that one can come to think that divine impassibility was a major object of debate in the early church as well. (5) As a patristic study Gavrilyuk's book is to be appraised. His aims go well beyond that, however, and Gavrilyuk both provides an intro duction to the contemporary debate and makes his own contribution to it. His description of the main arguments in the contemporary debate (pp. 5-15), however, is hopelessly superficial and prejudiced. There is nothing wrong with the fact that Gavrilyuk prefers the traditional position above its contemporary rivals, but that is no excuse for the caricature he paints of these. Let no one think that this is the status quaestionis! Moreover, where Gavrilyuk engages in a discussion with twentieth-century authors, he unfail ingly misses the mark. One telling example must suffice. Gavrilyuk claims: 'Jurgen Moltmann, EberhardJuingel, and Richard Bauckham see the crucifixion as the decisive revelation of the divine identity. But if this were the case, if divine identity were somehow defined by the crucifixion in such a way as to</page><page sequence="6">238 REVIEWS suggest that it was God's very nature to suffer in human fashion, then the assumption of the flesh would become quite unnecessary. For in this case the flesh would merely duplicate in its imperfect way the suffering that the Word had already undergone in his own nature' (174-175). Let's begin by noticing that none of the twentieth-century authors men tioned claims it was God's very nature to suffer in human fashion! All of them claim thatJesus' suffering in a human body reveals something about the eternal nature of God, i.e. that it is not untouched by some form of suffering, however different from and more perfect than human suffering. This, however, is just a characteristic slip of the pen in Gavrilyuk's description, the precision of which is directly proportional to the time gap separating us from the authors described. Things become worse when we inquire what Gavrilyuk's argument against the twentieth-century authors is. He suggests that Jesus' life and death may not be seen as the 'decisive revelation' of 'God's very nature', for if that would be the case, the 'assumption of the flesh would become quite unnecessary.' Why? Probably because it would be more of the same. If God had been suffering from all ages, why should Jesus suffer on the Cross? Consequently, if the incarnate Son suffers on the Cross, we may infer from this that 'God's very nature' is not suffering. Now let's apply this stunning piece of logic to various other aspects of Jesus' life and death. If the incarnate Son healed the sick, we should infer that it is not in 'God's very nature' to heal the sick! If Jesus came to save the sinners, we must infer that it is not in 'God's very nature' to save the sinners! If Jesus blessed the poor and lowly, we must infer that it is not in 'God's very nature' to bless the poor and lowly! The very least that we should say here, is that in order to lend any plausibility to the theological principle put forward in the above quotation, Gavrilyuk should have given us some criteria about its application and scope. In the absence of these, the principle is entirely unacceptable. I must confess, moreover, that I am at a complete loss to see how these criteria should be formulated. Let me conclude by two minor points of criticism: (1) The author seems to be unaware of the fact that the Theos in theopaschitism is the same as the Theos in theotokos: God the Son. Consequently, he uses 'theopaschitism' for the position that God (unqualfied) suffers (14, 74). (2) On p. 152 one should read anthropolatria for athropolatria.
