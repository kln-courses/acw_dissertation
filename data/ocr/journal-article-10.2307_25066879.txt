<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Akhziv Cemeteries: The Ben-Dor Excava tions, 1941-1944, by Michal Dayagi-Mendels. IAA Reports, No. 15. Jerusalem: Israel Antiquities Authority, 2002. vi + 176 pp., 97 figures, 33 plans, 1 table, 1 map. Paper. $30.00. This final report on important Iron Age burials at Akhziv is a welcome addition to studies on material culture from the Phoenician homeland. Dayagi-Mendels is to be commended for her exemplary research and presentation of dormant archaeological materials excavated over six decades ago. The volume consists of a brief introductory chapter, six body chapters, and a conclusion by Dayagi Mendels. Specialized appendixes follow on the epigraphy of the grave stelae by Frank Moore Cross and the scarabs and amulets by Othmar Keel. It is thoroughly illustrated, with detailed technical drawings of tomb plans, pottery, and other material culture, as well as object photographs. Given the circumstances leading up to the publication of this tomb material, detailed by Dayagi-Mendels in the preface and chapter 1, we owe a debt of gratitude to the author for presenting these finds to the scholarly commu nity. The cemeteries were first dug in 1921 by an unknown individual who claimed to have excavated close to 100 burials, recording the work in a note to the authorities. The cemeteries came to Ben-Dor's attention in 1941 when visiting Nahariya, where looted objects were for sale. Ben-Dor traveled to Akhziv to assess the situation and found recently plundered tombs. Rescue excavations were mounted to further hinder looting and to better understand the cemeteries. Four one-month excavation seasons were conducted between 1941 and 1944, the materials from which were transited and housed in the Rockefeller Mu seum. In 1947 war broke out; when fighting ended, the</page><page sequence="2">100 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 337 material was on one side of the border and the excavator on the other. Twenty years and another war later, Ben-Dor had access to his Akhziv materials; however, he passed away before publishing them. Domain over the materials was transferred to Ruth Hestrin, but she too passed before she could complete the project. Chapter 1 also contains useful overviews of the two main cemeteries, one to the south of the settlement site of Akhziv, called Ez-Zib or Buqbaq, and one to the east called Er-Ras. A map showing the position of the tell and the general locations of the southern and eastern burial grounds is lacking, although the verbal descriptions suf fice. The Ez-Zib cemetery is around 1 km south of the ancient city. Its tombs were cut into the soft sandstone bedrock. In his search for undisturbed tombs, Ben-Dor excavated trenches and discovered materials deposited above and between burials. Dayagi-Mendels notes that much of this material was ceremonial, including a large number of chalices and lamps that she believes were used in cultic rites. The Er-Ras cemetery is located on a lime stone spur to the east of the site. Dayagi-Mendels con cludes her introductory remarks with a revealing set of statements related to the analysis of the material. This was hindered by the passage of time since excavation and the recording and surveying methods of the period, not to mention damage from looting, war, and storage for over half a century. She notes in particular that skeletal infor mation is lacking, which is unfortunate but was not un usual for the period. Chapter 2 is a detailed analysis of the tomb typologies in both cemeteries. Dayagi-Mendels defines four primary types: (1) shaft tombs with one chamber, whose roofs were a part of the feature carved from the bedrock; (2) shaft tombs with one chamber, whose roofs were constructed from stone slabs; (3) a trough tomb; and (4) a masonry tomb. A variant Type 1.1 is also defined as similar to Type 1 tombs with additional niches cut into the bedrock. The Er-Ras cemetery was made up primarily of burials in tombs of Type 1 and Type 1.1, while the majority of burials in the Ez-Zib cemetery were in Type 2 tombs. Dayagi Mendels adds that Ez-Zib included four examples of Type 1 tombs, as well as the unique examples of Type 3 and Type 4 tombs (p. 4). This contradicts the later attribution of the one Type 4 tomb to the Er-Ras cemetery (pp. 103-4). Comparative evidence for shaft tombs from elsewhere in Syria-Palestine, as well as from Phoenician colonies in Cyprus and the western Mediterranean, is presented. From a structural point of view, this chapter should have been placed after the detailed discussions of each tomb, pre sented in chapters 3 and 4. Thus tomb typology would have followed these overview chapters and preceded the chap ters that deal with other typologies. Chapters 3 and 4 detail the tombs in the southern and eastern cemeteries, respectively. The form of each tomb is described, and top and section plans are provided where available. The contents of each tomb are presented, with highlights from the ceramics, metals, and other small finds illustrated in technical drawings or photographs. Dayagi Mendels discusses the periodization of the tombs based on the range of pottery forms and occasionally on chronologi cal information from scarabs. These two chapters contain a wealth of information presented in a highly organized, very usable fashion. The placement of tomb illustrations within the text, together with tables of finds, illustra tions, and photos following, makes it extremely easy for the reader to understand the morphology and contents of each tomb. Inlay eyeliners from imported Egyptian wooden coffins are discoveries of note. They were found in two Persian-period tombs in the Er-Ras cemetery and represent a less costly version of the imported Egyptian stone sar cophagi used in the burial of elite Phoenicians. The ceramic typology presented in chapter 5 divides the vessels into major categories, with descriptions of the features of each vessel type and subtype, fabric, parallels, chronology, and finally a list detailing which tombs con tained the vessel type. Like most tomb assemblages, the pottery types are skewed in number and variety. Interpret ing the functions of these ceramics is challenging, and even more so when dealing with looted tombs, imprecise notes, and methods from older excavations. Also, with multiple-use tombs it is exceedingly difficult to discern which grave goods belong to which burial. With these caveats in mind, it is interesting to note the number and variety of bowls and jugs, and the rarity of kraters, storage jars, juglets, cooking pots, and lamps. Bowls are typically associated with the consumption of food or liquids, and jugs with the serving of liquids. Dayagi-Mendels does not draw interpretive inferences from the ceramic evidence, and there is little discussion about the possible functions of the various pottery types she defines. Chapter 6 is focused on small finds and is primarily devoted to the remains related to adornment of the de ceased and to dress. Thus Dayagi-Mendels discusses the various types of jewelry, including earrings, finger rings, bracelets and armlets, and beads, pendants, and amulets from necklaces, as well as fibulae that would have been part of the clothing of the deceased. Other small find types that are catalogued in chapters 3 and 4 are not discussed typologically in chapter 6, including tools, weapons, weights, spindle whorls and a loom weight, gaming pieces, bone and ivory inlays, kohl sticks, and ivory pomegranates that may have been from small scepters. These other small finds are more likely to have been prized possessions of individuals buried in the tombs, or may have been interred as symbols of profession or of sta tus. Chapter 7 details the variety of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines from the cemeteries, along with other representative terra-cottas, such as boats, masks, and an architectural model. The variety of these terra cottas demonstrates that there was no standard figurine, or set of figurines, that was deposited with any regularity with burials.</page><page sequence="3">2005 BOOK REVIEWS 101 In her summary chapter, Dayagi-Mendels notes the rel ative uniformity of the tombs in the two cemeteries from Akhziv and suggests that the families buried in both were from similar segments of their society. She speculates that this represented a middle class, an attribution that seems anachronistic and awaits a more robust reconstruction of Phoenician social structure based on remains from ceme teries. The author notes that there is very little material evidence for contact with neighboring Israel or Judah. There are also very few remains that show connections with East Greece or Egypt; the majority of foreign goods were Cypriot. This dearth of imports in tombs primarily dating to the ninth-seventh centuries b.c.e., the exact time of the great Phoenician expansion and colonization through out the entire Mediterranean, speaks to a regionalism in the Phoenician homeland. We are in debt to Dayagi Mendels for her excellent presentation of the Akhziv cem eteries and look forward to further final reports on the subsequent excavations of Phoenician tombs from this important Iron Age site.
