<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rejoinder to Schuyler Cammann's Review of The Decoration of Mirrors of the Han Period The review of my book The Decoration of Mir- rors of the Han Period by Mr. Schuyler Cammann (JAOS, Vol. 81, No. 3 [1961], pp. 331-336) is a challenge which demands an answer. Of the more than 90 mirrors dealt with in the book, the re- viewer considers 9 as forgeries or as later in date than I had estimated, and concludes his review with the following statement: "A definite book on Han mirror patterns, giving a more precise chro- nology of their development, based on experience with actual examples, is still greatly needed." My answer will, therefore, mainly be confined to a discussion of the validity of the arguments on which the reviewer bases his rejection of the genu- iness or date of these mirrors. In recent years a large number of mirrors have been excavated in China, many of them found in tombs of the Han period. Examples referred to in my reply will, for the most part, be chosen from recent Chinese publications. The reviewer's remark that "more recently, it has been impossible to get reports at all, as the Mainland Chinese have ceased to share their findings with scholars in other lands." seems not to be altogether accurate, the less so as most of the publications mentioned in my reply came out only after I had completed work on my book. According to the reviewer the mirror PI. 37 is decadent . . . lacking any recognizable sym- bol in its design except for the TLY marks of the frame itself, very likely dates fromn the post-Han period when old traditions in North China tended to disintegrate under " barbarian " rulers. The caption says of the latter, " Owner unknown," and the state of the illustration shows that it must have been drawn from some book, which is not cited." The reviewer overlooked the fact that on page 55, in discussing this mirror, I pointed out that a similar mirror had recently been found in a Han tomb. It might have been advisable to look up the Chinese publication (referred to in the foot- note) in which a picture of this mirror was shown, before condemning the mirror in such terms. The accuracy of my judgment and dating has, in the meantime, been confirmed by the discovery of the same type of mirror in tombs in China which date from the later part of the Western Han to the early Eastern Han period.' I may add that I acquired the photograph of this mirror some years ago from the Courtauld Institute in London, where I was told that the owner was unknown. The one valid criticism is that I overlooked the inscription in the centre of the mirror (P1. 29). However, I cannot agree with the reviewer's esti- mate of this mirror which, according to him, "is certainly atypical, even suspiciously so . . . " This mirror has been published previously by Professor S. IUmehara,2 an expert on inscription and one of the best, if not the best, connoisseurs of ancient Chinese mirrors. He considered this mirror not only as genuine, but as one of the outstanding mirrors in the famous Moriya collection and dated it first century B. c. As I have explained in my book, various stylistic features of this mirror con- firmed Professor Umehara's date. Further objec- tions raised against this mirror are concerned with ' Loyang Shao-kou 1an mu,a (Han tombs excavated in Shao-kou, Loyang) by the Archaeological Excavation Team of the Loyang area.

The reviewer remarks: "If the author never saw the inscription, how does she know it is of a type often found on early Han mirrors? Actually, the eight characters shown constitute two auspicious phrases, neither of which is known from previously discovered Han mirrors, and although the sentiments are similar to those found on Western Han mirrors, the wording of one of them in particular tzu' sun pu chiieh seems centuries later." This attack is surprising because (as I state on page 38) I quote Professor Umehara's translation which reads: "The brilliance is like that of the sun and moon; posterity ever con- tinuing." If the reviewer would only have looked at some mirror of the Han period he would soon have found out that inscriptions referring to the brilliance of sun and moon are very common es- pecially on late Western Han mirrors.3 Moreover, Professor Karlgren in his article on Early Chinese Mirror Inscriptions quotes both phrases quite fre- quently.4 Neither does the choice of characters warrant any later date; chiieh is quoted by Karl- gren several times 5 and according to him and other scholars it is sometimes incorrectly written chi,6 e. g. on a late Western Han mirror found in Shensi.7 There seems, therefore, to be no reason for assuming that the inscription warrants a " cen- turies later " date. Further objections against this mirror are based on some of its decoration. The reviewer writes: Another principal feature on this mirror in PI. 29 is the outer ring of design depicting the four animals known as the ssit she'n. Here the four creatures are shown racing madly around the ring, with the dragon and tiger extended in the "flying gallop," whereas on Western Han mirrors the dragon and tiger from this group are characteristically shown slinking in a very deliberate, rather sinister, fashion. In view of all these discrepancies, it seems impossible to consider this as an authentic example of the Western Han period, which the author frequently cites it as being. This mirror is the earliest type of this kind of TLV mirror known to us, and so far there are no other mirrors with which it could be compared (see page 38). However, the fact that animals are shown on it in "flying gallop" speaks for, not against, an early date, because it is a very common motif in Western Han art,8 and to reject a mirror as genuine and as later Western Han because it is decorated with animals in " flying gallop " shows a surprising lack of the most elementary knowl- edge of Chinese art. The conclusion can be drawn that the reviewer has not been able to state a single valid point why this mirror should be "centuries later," " atypical and even suspiously so." Mr. Cammann uses the word "atypical" several times to prove that a mirror, or an inscription is late or a forgery. Apparently he classifies as "atypical" all mirror types or inscriptions not known to him. However, his evaluation appears still to be based on the time and occasions when, as he writes, he looked "through the jumble of wares in the Tung-hsi shops in pre-war China." Since then a great number of mirrors have been found in tombs of the Han period and many are decorated in a manner hitherto not known which might well, at that time, have been considered to be forgeries or later copies. Another mirror which the reviewer doubts is Fig. G. According to him: Its pattern is a welter of anachronism. The center depicts only three of the Four Spirits (ssii shln), and 3 Shensi sheng ch'u t'u t'ung ching,c (Bronze mirrors excavated in the province of Shensi) by the Cultural Bureau of the province of Shensi) (1959), PI. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28; Loyang ch'u t'u ku ching, op. cit., PI. 51, 52, 53, 56, 57, 64; Hunanr ch'u t'u t'ung chinrg t'u JU,d (Pictures of Bronze Mirrors excavated in Hunan) by the Cultural Bureau of the province of Hunan) (1960), PI. 54, 55. 4 BMFEA, No. 6, pp. 8-81.

In addition to other unfamiliar elements in the design, these numerous icono- graphic mistakes would suggest a very late Han or post-Han date, when the earliest traditions had been forgotten, or even a much later forgery; but it is repre- sented as a type example for the period of Wang Mang, and a number of theories and later citations are based on this untenable attribution. In reality plain facts speak a very different lan- guage; the absence of one of the Four Spirits (ssui shen) is quite common and can be seen on a great number of TLV and other mirrors found in tombs of the Han period in provinces as far apart as Hunan, Chekiang and Shensi; 9 on a large number of Han mirrors animals do not move in the same direction, nor do they always follow one another in the proper order but are often shown running in opposite directions or facing one another.'0 The lack of one of the letters can be seen on many TLV mirrors dating from the Western Han to post-Han periods.1" The coin image, as I pointed out, was one first cast during Wang Mang's time; it was not so popular as the wu-chu coin which was recast throughout the Han period. A forger of later date would hardly have selected it as decoration. The reversal of two characters on the coin imprint is a mistake which could happen to an artisan of the Han period no less than to a forger of later times. A final proof that mirrors of this type were made during the Han period is provided by a mirror found in 1956 in Hunan in a tomb of the Han period.'2 It shows exactly the same half-kneeling, half running human figure facing not a tiger but a bird and other animals moving in different directions. If the reviewer had read the book more carefully he would have known that this is no ordinary ssfi she'n mirror but, as pointed out (e. g. pages 56 and 82-84) belongs to another group, examples of which include mirrors shown in fig. F, P1. 39 and 40. In fig. F (dated A.D. 10) and on P1. 39 Hsi-wang-mu is shown surrounded by some of her common companions and additional figures on these mirrors reveal that the decoration illus- trates legends centering round Hsi-wang-mu and the archer Hou-i (or Hou Yi). The design, there- fore, is neither a "welter of anachronism" nor does it contain "numerous iconographic mistakes," but is quite logical. The date I gave to this mirror is not Wang Mang but "between Wang Mang's time and the beginning of the Middle Eastern Han period." In regard to the date, it should be noted that a mirror with the same type of border pattern has recently been excavated in Honan. It was found together with a TLV mirror with de- corations typical of the style during Wang Mang's time. Both mirrors contain in their inscriptions references to the Hsin dynasty, i. e. to Wang Mang's shortlived reign.13 There seems, therefore, not the slightest reason to believe that this mirror is of very late Han or post-Han date; on the con- trary, mirrors found in Han tombs after I com- pleted the book support the correctness of my dating. After having, in his opinion, demolished my judgment of these two mirrors, the reviewer continues: Since the mirrors in PI. 29 and fig. G apparently served as the basis for the statement that animal borders originated in the period before the Eastern Han, and since both these mirrors are later, if not spurious, we have nothing to show that such borders began until the Later (Eastern) Han period, at the earliest. Actually, they probably originated rather late in that period, being a mark of decadence. Among other signs that they are characteristic of a late development, in a time of break- down of old traditions, we find that the mirrors on which they occur often have a defective central patterns. For example, the mirror on PI. 40 displays the ssft she'n in the wrong order, while that on PI. 42 lacks the turtle and the snake, showing an anthropomorphic monster wrestling with the serpent, instead. Further anachronism, including a border procession that changes directions in a disconcerting fashion, even showing one animal walking upside down, plus faulty casting, all mark the mirror PI. 42a as an obvious fake. This is an example of the careless manner in which this review is written. I could never have based 9 E. g.

Secondly, my evidence that animal borders began in the late Western Han period is not based on the decoration of the rim of the mirror in fig. G, but, as I wrote on page 68-69, on a mirror found in a Western Han tomb in Ch'ang-sha in Hunan. Mirror with animal border patterns have in recent years been found in quite a number of tombs of the time of transition, that is between the later part of the first century B. c. and the beginning of the Eastern Han period,14 including the one found in Honan mentioned above.13 It would be interesting to know on what factual evidence the reviewer based his statement that animal borders originate rather late in the Eastern Han period and are a "mark of decadence." The centre of the mirror P1. 40 is not at all defective, but as explained above, be- longs to a different group of mirrors and is not an ordinary ssit she'n mirror. Anthropomorphic monsters can be found on a great many Han mir- rors 15 and the reviewer must have overlooked the fact that the mirror fig. C. found in a Western Han tomb in Ch'ang-sha is decorated with anthro- pomorphic creatures. Nor would the fact that the border procession changes direction prove that the mirror P1. 42a is late or a forgery, not even that one of the animals is walking upside down. These features can all be found on genuine Han mirrors.16 However, the reviewer seems again to have overlooked the fact that this mirror has been included as a warning showing the deterioration of TLV mirrors, long after the close of the Han period. The mirror on P1. 57,17 dated by inscription A. D. 117 is, in the view of Mr. Cammann, another "blatant later forgery." It is, according to him . . . decorated with a soulful looking ram awkwardly deployed around the central boss. The faulty depiction of both horns and hoofs might cause one to pause before assigning it to a Han artist, but the presence of the Eight Trigrams in the late arrangement ascribed by Sung scholars to the legendary Fu-hsi, and the fact that the two inscriptions are given in separate kinds of pseudo-archaic writing, both make it quite clear that this was a forgery, made expressly to appeal to a scholar of a later period interested in epigraphy and dated inscriptions. Even the texture of the surface, which is clearly apparent in the splendid reproduction, shows that the mirror was probably cast from a free wax model in a technique that was not characteristic of the Han period. However, a similarly "awkwardly deployed" ani- mal decorates a stone mirror found in a tomb of the Han period in Hunan 18 and another creature in a similar position is shown on a mirror exca- vated in Shensi.19 As pointed out on page 74 mirror centres covered by a heraldic looking bird are quite common in the Han period and some have been found in tombs of the Eastern Han period.20 On the contrary, far from being a sign of a later date or forgery the fact that the ram is "awkwardly deployed" and shown with its head not only turned back but twisted upwards at the same time confirms the correctness of its date. The tiger and dragon figures on mirrors dealt with in the same group are extremely "awkwardly de- ployed " and animal figures on stone or other mate- rials excel in twisting their bodies and turning their heads much in the same manner 2' including some on a mirror found in Hunan which, accord- ing to its style, must roughly date from the same period as the mirror PI. 57.22 That rams play an important part in the art of the Han period is shown by their representation on doors of tombs and on other places. Pictures of such animals can often be found impressed on round tiles (see page 74), sometimes with a similar inscription in ar- chaic writing according to which the figure repre- sents a ram or "auspicious ram." There is, there- fore, every reason to accept the choice of such a 14 E. g. one found in a tomb in Pai-sha (Yil-hsien), Honan, Kaogu xuebao, 1959, No. 1, page 75, fig. 2; Loyang ch'u t'u ku ching, op. cit., P1. 69 (end of Western Han), P1. 75, P1. 77, both dated: early Eastern Han time. 16 E. g. many can be found in Western publications, such as Karlgren's "Huai and Han," op. cit., P1. 80, (L. 3).

There is nothing in the treatment of the horns and hoofs which speaks against a Han date; on the contrary, the hoofs resemble closely those of stags engraved on a stone found in a tomb of the later Han period in Shan- tung.23 To use different types of script on one and the same mirror is characteristic of Han mir- rors; ancient types of characters are most often used in the inner section of the mirror while inscriptions on the outer sections are written in contemporary style. In the latter part of the Eastern Han period sometimes two different types of archaic characters are used in the inner and outer section of a mirror.24 Moreover (see page 74), interest in archaic forms of writing is exactly what one would expect at this period because it was during this time that Hsii Shen wrote his famous dictionary of ancient characters. Tri- grams played an important part in the Han period and can e. g. be found on a divination board dis- covered in a Han tomb in Korea. According to ancient tradition the so-called Fu-hsi sequence is older than the Wlen Wang order; 25 the rejection of the antiquity of this sequence and the belief that it was not invented before the Sung period, is a hypothesis and I wonder whether the reviewer has taken the trouble to check the arguments of the Chinese scholars mentioned by Needham20 or just accepted their judgment without questioning. As in many other cases, archaeological evidence might prove that ancient traditions are more accurate than the estimates of scholars of later times. Moreover, certain facts speak against a later date of this mirror which the reviewer could have easily ascertained by looking at mirrors of later periods with trigrams. All of them are arranged in the so-called Wen Wang sequence.21 Nor does the treatment of the surface of the mirror resemble in the least the soft and dough-like figures on Sung and later mirror.28 On the con- trary, it corresponds exactly to the treatment of figures typical of this type of mirror in the Eastern Han period, as described by me on pages 71-74. The workmanship of this mirror, which is one of the many I have personally examined, is of su- perior quality, hardly to be expected from a later forger who worked for scholars interested in mir- rors mainly for the sake of "epigraphy and dated inscriptions." To sum up: stylistic and other features confirm that this mirror is not only genu- ine Han but that its date is accurate. The mirror on P1. 25, dated A. D. 64, is rated as: . . . another possible forgery . . . . made later for a date-minded antiquarian." Mirrors of this type have recently been found in large quantities in Han tombs.29 This one corresponds in style to others which for one reason or another can be attributed to the first century A. D.30 Moreover, typical of inscription on mirrors from the Five Dynasties period onwards is that they are set apart in a framed panel and not included in the design as on this mirror31 even when the mirror copies an archaistic design.32 The last mirror objected to as another probably forgery is fig. M., dated A. D. 281. It has an extremely large and flat knob which-as I pointed out on page 98-is typical of mirrors of post-Han date and can be seen on mirrors of the Six 23 Tomb near Fushan, excavated by the Cultural Bureau of the province of Shantung.

I hope, however, that they will read the text more carefully and that their criticism will be based on a sound knowledge of Chinese art in general and of mirrors in particular. Beyond the discussion of actual mirrors much more space is given by Mr. Cammann to what he calls ". . . the promulgation of certain personal theories regarding these patterns . . ." of which he heartily disapproves. Everybody has the right to reject my interpretation of some mirror patterns as images of parasols or canopies. However, from a serious reviewer one can expect that, at least, he will take the trouble to read the article to which the reader is referred to in the text and in various footnotes.35 That this disregard is intentional and not just an oversight is plainly revealed in a quotation from the text in which the words refer- ring to this article "As explained elsewhere are left out and replaced by dots. The aim of this book is to establish a chronology and other aspects are dealt with only insofar as they are essential for the understanding of particular features of mirrors, and relevant to their dates. A reviewer referring to my interpretation in regard to proto- types and meaning of some patterns should read the article before drawing conclusions which are misleading. He could then certainly no more have accused me of e.g.: not mentioning the re- viewer's article on TLY mirrors;336 not offering an interpretation of TLV patterns; ignorance concerning the terrestrial aspect of mirror symbol- ism, or, believing that the signs on these mirrors referred to the sky only,38 which he calls an ". . . obsession" which "leads to amusing contradic- tions,"39 and, in general, unfamiliarity with the most elementary forms of cosmological symbolism. Moreover, a more careful reading of my book would have shown him that I never interpreted signs on these mirrors in the limited sense of symbolizing the canopy of the sky only. E. g. on page 35 I wrote: "Cosmological speculations oc- cupied the minds of the people of the Han dynasty ...... and their belief in the identity of macro- cosm and microcosm enabled them to interpret the signs on these mirrors in terms of time, space, order of society, moral commands, life and death of human beings, and so on." It would lead too far to deal separately with other points raised by the reviewer, such as border patterns, handling of mirrors, the character erh 40 and other matters. A. BULLING.
