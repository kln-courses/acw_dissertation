Donnelly proposes to specify the function and theoretical foundations of human rights, that is, such rights as are "held equally by all persons simply because they are human beings" (p. 9). Beside drawing useful distinctions, Donnelly's main contribution is to outline a "constructivist" theory of human rights, according to which such rights depend on human potential and are universally shared. (This conception rests on something like Bishop Butler's idealized human nature, though the author does not remark on the comparison.) The constructivist account stresses a "forward-looking" moral vision such that the historical particularity of claims to human rights may be identified without sacrificing the requirement of universality. But as Donnelly suggests, his constructivism is purely formal and demands a "politically relevant" philosophical anthropology if defensible lists of human rights are to be generated (p. 37). The book manifests a rare order of intellectual honesty. Donnelly concedes that his theory of human rights is at best fragmentary, which it is, but hopes that it points in promising directions, which it does. His criticism of other theorists 888</page><page sequence="2">Book Notes 889 is acute, and the book as a whole, while very sketchy, articulates some novel ideas which deserve consideration. T. M. R. MacFarlane, L. J. The Theory and Practice of Human Rights. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1985. Pp. 193. $25.00 (cloth). The book promises to "discuss selected key rights with a view to determining what minimum area and practical form of the right can be substantiated in universally applicable forms." That promise is not kept. The book is divided into nine chapters. The first is a general discussion of "the nature of human rights." The next seven concern particular rights or classes of such rights (e.g., "the right to life" or "economic and social rights"). The ninth chapter, though titled "Problems of Implementation," is simply a summary of the conclusions of the preceding eight. What little theory there is derives from recent philosophical work, especially that of Ronald Dworkin. The book makes no significant contribution to that work. Discussion of actual practice is also quite limited (though there is a lot of miscellaneous information about particular human rights in particular countries). Most of the book consists of the writer's citation of particular human rights documents, his explanation of what he takes the various rights to consist in, and his statement and dismissal of various alternatives. The argument for his view, when there is one, is almost always thin. The book might serve as a reference or starting point for someone not familiar with either the theory or practice of human rights. M. D. Cauthen, Kenneth. Process Ethics: A Constructive System. New York: Edwin Mellen Press, 1985. Pp. ii + 365. $59.95 ($14.95 if used as text). An exceptionally well written, well reasoned, informed, and useful book, Process Ethics is "a systematic, inclusive theory of ethics based on process theology," presented as a philosophical ethics and a Christian natural ethics. Equally strong in ethical theory, metaethics, and discussion of current issues and specific cases in the context of classical and contemporary theory, Cauthen excels at presenting relevant cases followed by lucid and concise observations illustrating the impact of opposing theories upon their resolution. Defining process metaphysics as the claim that "there is at work in the world a creative purpose which brings into being experiencing subjects who have intrinsic worth and a potential for enjoyment" (p. 125), Cauthen derives the moral im- perative: "Respond to the creation of life in the evolutionary process by honoring the intrinsic value of living beings and by promoting the fulfillment of their potential" (p. 127). This must be done contextually and lovingly. A one-hundred- page discussion concluding that "social welfare, freedom and equality are the three values that constitute the heart of justice, each to be maximized to the extent allowed by the pull of the other two" (p. 305) is followed by Cauthen's stands on social, political, and economic issues. E. H. C.</page><page sequence="3">890 Ethics July 1986 Cooney, Timothy J. Telling Rightfrom Wrong: What Is Moral, What Is Immoral, and What Is Neither One Nor the Other. Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1985. Pp. 158. $17.95 (cloth). This is not a philosophically illuminating book. Cooney's central thesis is that moral philosophy has failed to separate two matters passing as morality (p. 17). Genuine moral judgments are elliptical for arguments about rightness or wrongness with respect to shared desires (such as the desire to stay alive) and include claims that murder, robbery, arson, and pollution are morally wrong. Claims about abortion, capital punishment, homosexuality, and gambling, however, are opinions charading as moraljudgments because such acts "would not cause the destruction of the group if we allowed one person to do them freely or everyone to do them once" (p. 103). The distinction is suspect given that abortion and capital punishment, for example, can be viewed as murder. It is ultimately simplistic since Cooney's test for differentiating a genuine moral issue is that saying that the statement is an opinion "sounds odd and jarring" (p. 58). Cooney's "precise definitions" are vacuous; for example, "right" means correct or coherent for us to do given our shared desires (p. 34). Discussion of alternative theories is dogmatic and misleading: rights are "political opinions concerning how a group should conduct itself and thus, have nothing to do with morality" (p. 135), Kant's view is presented as utilitarian generalization, and utilitarianism fails because "it lays the groundwork for wiping out one group of innocents after another so that those remaining can enjoy the greater pleasure" (p. 133). In sum, Cooney's book is no better than his widely publicized forgery used to gain publication. J. W. D. Wollheim, Richard. The Thread of Life. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1984. Pp. xv + 288. $22.00 (cloth). This book contains the revised and expanded version of the William James Lectures in philosophy Richard Wollheim delivered at Harvard University in 1982. The lectures continue Wollheim's interest in philosophical psychology, particularly in Freudian metapsychology. The overarching theme of the lectures is, What does it mean to be a person-not personal identity-rather, what does it mean to live the life of a person? Wollheim discusses the person within "a genetic or developmental account" as required by Freudian psychology (p. 176). This is quite different from what has become known in contemporary philosophy as the issue of personal identity. Analytic philosophers, such as Derek Parfit and Saul Kripke, treat the topic of what it means to be a person within the context of logical analysis. Their discussions turn on the logical definitions for and uses of terms like "continuity," "sameness," and "identity." Wollheim presents his interpretation of persons independently of any contemporary treatment of personal identity. Wollheim's thesis is that living the life of a person is essentially an intellectual activity. It consists in understanding what it means to lead that life. To explain what he means by "understanding," Wollheim looks at various psychological processes such as narcissism, derealization, and depersonalization. He also examines common psychological phenomena such as love, friendship, and selfishness.</page><page sequence="4">Book Notes 891 Wollheim sees philosophy as inadequate for the task unless it begins to treat psychological issues such as the formation of the superego, the coloring of conscious mental events by sexuality, and the expression of instincts in consciousness. He explains some of these psychological phenomena in Freudian terminology. Wol- lheim's command of Freud, both historically and conceptually, is to be respected, but he fails to show the relevance of his psychological account for philosophy of mind and moral philosophy. His discussion of what it means to be a person assumes a philosophical model that is never defined. (For example, Wollheim uses the term "disposition" throughout the book but does not explain according to which philosophical tradition he is using it.) Wollheim's discussion of what it means to be a person could provide a feasible alternative to the analytic approaches to personal identity if Freudian psychological terms were integrated with phil- osophical ones. R. M. M. Amjad-Ali, Charles, and Pitcher, W. Alvin, eds. Liberation and Ethics: Essays in Religious Social Ethics in Honor of Gibson Winter. Chicago: Center for the Scientific Study of Religion, 1985. Pp. xi+ 233. $24.95 (cloth). This tribute to the life and work of Gibson Winter is divided into three centers of attention: sociology of religion, religious social ethics, and critical hermeneutics. The essays intend to be constructive responses to Winter's influence. They are diverse and wide-ranging, moving both at the levels of theory and praxis. Some of the essays in the area of critical hermeneutics and phenomenology are burdened by unexpounded technical terminology. And some essays end at the point where constructive questions begin. Generally, however, the essays are fitting responses to a life spent in creative engagement with the problems of religious social ethics. H. L. H. Bowie, Norman E., ed. Making Ethical Decisions. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1985. Pp. xii+ 371. $17.95 (paper). With so many ethics anthologies in print, a new arrival must be put immediately to the test of pedagogical utility, i.e., it must be asked what it can achieve that existing texts cannot. Norman Bowie's Making Ethical Decisions answers this question rather well because of both its clear topical focus and its balanced mix of old and new material. The ethics textbook market has become increasingly dominated by current issue readers covering topics such as abortion, euthanasia, and capital punishment. In contrast, Bowie's book excludes such topics in order to devote full attention to ethical theory. The result is a collection that separates ethical theory into four broad categories: the possibility of morality, the scope of morality, fundamental ethical principles, and ethical decisions in a social context. Each of the four sections merges contemporary with classical figures, and hence the reader en-</page><page sequence="5">892 Ethics July 1986 counters Wellman, Hare, Toulmin, and Gewirth side by side with historical lu- minaries such as Plato, Aristotle, and Butler. An engaging feature of the book is its topical geography, which, in addition to laying out standard issues, frames new ones. Thus, formal subheadings in the book include not only the familiar "Utilitarianism," "Rights," and "Why Be Ethical?" but also "Respect for Persons" and "Moral Duties and Moral Ideals." T. D. Nielsen, Kai. Philosophy and Atheism. Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1985. Pp. 231. $18.95 (cloth). In this interesting set of eleven papers-some new, others written in the sixties and seventies -Nielsen elaborates his verificationist attack on theism. Eventually, the line goes something like this: conceptions of God are either anthropomorphic, or they are not. On the one hand, an anthropomorphic God (e.g., the one defended by Alvin Plantinga) is highly improbable. On the other hand, the concept of a nonanthropomorphic, ineffable something (e.g., the sort of concept recommended by Aquinas and Calvin) is incoherent. Statements that purport to be factual claims about such a God are completely incapable of being confirmed or disconfirmed (p. 117). Moreover, no identifying description of the supposed referent has even been provided (p. 83). Nielsen does not conclude that the term "God" is devoid of meaning. There are correct and incorrect uses of the term (pp. 82-83). Nevertheless, the concept is incoherent. In addition to papers de- veloping this attack, there is a piece on humanistic ethics as contrasted to religious ethics, and a very nice discussion of Anthony Flew's God, Freedom and Immortality (Buffalo, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 1984). H. S. C. Dahl, Robert A. A Preface to Economic Democracy. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985. Pp. vii+ 184. $14.95 (cloth). Those readers who have followed the intellectual odyssey of Robert Dahl will find much that is familiar in this interesting analysis of the alleged tension between equality and liberty. In this short book, Dahl addresses the argument that there is an inherent conflict between the expansion of social and political equality and the preservation of liberty. While the question was posed by the founders of the U.S. Constitution in terms of the effects of equality and democracy on economic liberty (in the form of private property), Dahl suggests that the changing economic order brought about by modern capitalism has reformulated the question in terms of the effects of economic liberty on the level of social and political equality. He asks whether we can create a society that provides greater equality and that more approaches our notions of democracy without giving up liberty. After beginning with an analysis of the traditional formulation of the problem as posed by Tocqueville, Dahl offers an alternative view that emphasizes the equal status of equality and liberty in modern democratic societies. The remaining sections of the book constitute a proposal for economic reforms that Dahl contends</page><page sequence="6">Book Notes 893 would enhance equality without destroying our basic liberties. These reforms involve Dahl's familiar support for worker-owned and worker-controlled industries. While Dahl has proposed these reforms in other contexts, his ideas remain challenging and worthy of serious consideration and debate. J. K. Green, Philip. Retrieving Democracy: In Search of Civic Equality. Totowa, N.J.: Rowman &amp; Allanheld, 1985. Pp. ix+ 278. $19.95 (cloth). For Philip Green, the task of "retrieving democracy" is the central theoretical and political question of our time. This retrieval requires an analysis of what a true democracy would entail and what it is about the present order that prevents the achievement of such a democracy. In this provocative new analysis, Green offers some important insights into the present shortcomings of democracy in advanced industrial societies. More than merely undertaking another analysis of democracy, he also proposes a political and economic program for its imple- mentation. In contrast to many existing arguments for democratic reform that have been incapable of attracting the support of the mass coalition necessary for political change, Green suggests that his approach is both novel and practical enough to appeal to such a political base. The argument rests on the premise that political equality is the major concern of citizens in modern society. Political equality, however, cannot be achieved without social equality. Therefore, social equality must be achieved first; its achievement requires fundamental changes in the economic structure of society. This argument is not as novel as Green suggests, and it is open to considerable debate whether posing the problem in terms of the prerequisites of political equality will attract mass support for fun- damental economic change. Nonetheless, Green's presentation is a thoughtful and informative addition to this ongoing debate. J. K. Smith, Rogers M. Liberalism and American Constitutional Law. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985. Pp. 328. $22.50 (cloth). The major strengths of Rogers Smith's book are two: it provides an excellent critical survey of the major contending schools of constitutional interpretation while it presents a consistent argument that a reconstructed version of Lockean liberalism provides the best possibility for developing a unified account of con- stitutional principles. Smith makes his case in three stages. The first sets out the aims of early liberalism, acknowledging its inconsistencies as put forward by John Locke and his successors. Smith then examines the alternative theories of political purpose he calls the communitarian, the romantic, and the egalitarian. With great clarity, Smith illustrates the problems of these approaches by discussing four key issues in constitutional law: due process, free speech, political appor- tionment, and governmental responsibility for social and economic welfare. The final section directly addresses the task of providing a convincing restatement of the Lockean notion that the purpose of government is to "promote the capacities</page><page sequence="7">894 Ethics July 1986 of all for reflective self-direction or rational liberty." The conclusion which is critical of Rawls and Dworkin will not convince all critics of Lockeanism, but the book gives an excellent overview of constitutional problems and debates. W. M. S. Memmi, Albert. Dependence: A Sketch for a Portrait of the Dependent. Boston: Beacon Press, 1984. Pp. viii+ 185. $17.95 (cloth). Albert Memmi is a French philosopher-psychologist-sociologist who has written much in the past on the subject of subjection and domination. A stay at the hospital has made him recognize the difference between dependence and dom- ination. Dependence is based on consent and satisfies some need of the dependent in a way that domination does not. Patients are dependent on their doctors; prisoners are simply dominated by the prison staff. This book is an analysis of the relation of dependence in its various forms, using examples from everyday life and literature but drawing inspiration mainly from Freudian and humanistic psychology. While Memmi discusses many examples, two are clearly the most paradigmatic and the richest in detail: the dependence of the child on the mother and the dependence of the faithful on God. The book is written in straightforward and simple language, accessible to a very broad audience. Memmi's subject should make it attractive to those readers of Ethics interested in moral positions centering on love and responsibility as recently explored by Gilligan. Unfortunately, what they will find reads too much like Games People Play rather than a serious analysis of an important moral phenomenon. Memmi's book is better read as a symptom of a "therapeutic" culture than as a potential source of deeper understanding. K. So. Hookway, Christopher, ed. Minds, Machines and Evolution: Philosophical Studies. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984. Pp. xi+ 177. $29.95 (cloth). This collection of papers is loosely organized around two approaches to the theory of mind-evolutionary biology and Artificial Intelligence (Al). Christopher Hookway compares Peirce and Quine as epistemologists. David Hull argues that biological species are historical entities -individuals, not natural kinds -and that events involving them are better understood by way of historical narratives rather than covering-law explanations. Elliott Sober presents an illu- minating account of fitness and selection. John Maynard Smith makes some intriguing suggestions about the evolution of intelligence based on evolutionary game theory. Neil Tennant gives a provocative, though very loosely argued, account of how language might have evolved. These pieces provide easy intro- ductions to several large literatures with useful references. On the Al side, there are papers by Yorick Wilks (consciousness in machines), Margaret Boden (animal perception from an Al viewpoint), and Daniel Dennett. The pieces by Wilks and Boden are thin and rather unconvincing, owing perhaps to the dearth of solid results in Al to work from. Dennett's paper ("Cognitive</page><page sequence="8">Book Notes 895 Wheels") examines the "frame problem" and criticizes some standard Al moves as "profoundly unbiological"; anyone interested in epistemology should read it. C. C. Keller, Evelyn Fox. Reflections on Gender and Science. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1985. Pp. viii+ 189. $17.95 (cloth). Feminism begins by focusing on the situation of women. But in demonstrating that their subordination is not a natural phenomenon, that women have been made rather than born, as Simone de Beauvoir said, it becomes evident that men, too, in their domination and in their proudest cultural achievements, have been deeply marked by the social and conceptual hierarchies propping up a patriarchal worldview. Even scientific inquiry, maintains Evelyn Fox Keller, has developed in a way which expresses an ideology of masculinity as well as a desire for knowledge. Keller traces the historical emergence of the modern conception of scientific knowledge from Plato's denial of the female-associated material substrata to Bacon's notion that the female chaos of nature must be dominated and controlled by the man of science. She draws psychoanalytic connections between the male child's development of autonomy from the mother under patriarchy and the methodological assumptions of many scientists seeking laws by which to know and control a passive natural object. Arguing that the ideology of masculinity has become a constraint on the further development of science, Keller offers an alternative paradigm of scientific inquiry involving a dynamic process of interaction between the scientific subject and the natural world in all its complexity. This is the sort of book which should make people begin to realize the broad social significance of a feminist analysis of gender relations. P. S. M. Forbes, Graeme. The Metaphysics of Modality. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1985. Pp. x+257. $29.95 (cloth). This work is a sophisticated but accessible defense of a collection of theses concerning possible worlds semantics and the nature of modal reality. Many of the theses have had their defenders. What is unique here is the attempt to fashion a coherent whole from some seemingly disparate elements. For example, Forbes is an antirealist about possible worlds. Hence, he holds that sentences purportedly quantifying over possible worlds are literally false. He also holds that the standard interpretation of modal operators as quantifiers over possible worlds captures the literal meanings of such operators. And he regards at least some everyday modal assertions as literally true. His way around the obvious tension is to reinterpret the quantifiers in a way which retains the methods of possible worlds semantics without the ontological commitments. But if one is serious about antirealism, it is difficult to see why at least some of the traditional worries-worries about transworld identity and the counterpart relation-do notjust evaporate. Forbes confronts such issues</page><page sequence="9">896 Ethics July 1986 head on. His positions are eclectic, but they are informed by a sustained, if controversial, vision of the nature of modal reality. He believes that the modal facts about certain broad categories of things -specifically, sets, organisms, artifacts, substances, events, and properties -can be discerned by sustained a priori analysis of the concepts which define what it is to be an entity of each of these categories. K. A. T. Wilson, H. T. Tradition and Innovation: The Idea of Civilization as Culture and Its Signnificance. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984. Pp. x+260. $35.00 (cloth). H. T. Wilson denies that innovation and tradition frame a genuine dichotomy, for innovation is the very form of our tradition. This denial serves as a point of departure for a critical investigation of Western industrial civilization and its self- understanding. Dialectically developing insights from Wittgenstein, Marx, and Weber (that "archetypal icon of non-critical criticism"), Wilson takes "innovation" to be a hieroglyph-or code word-whose secret meaning is to be found in that more imposing trinity which reigns over the consciousness of modernity-ratio- nality, history, and progress. Deciphering the hieroglyph proves to be no easy task on Wilson's own account, nor does deciphering the deciphering. The world of innovation is indeed hieroglyphic-especially where "unhinged," we come to it "as an observable yet abstract totality made up of 'concrete' parts-as-facts-as- events in the form of empirical particulars." Working through this exceedingly nontraditional language generally proves worth it, however, for there are par- ticularly insightful discussions of the "disciplined observer," the myths of objectivity, and the technical bias of our Western civilization. Best of all, Wilson turns some of our most "civilized" tools-like cultural anthropology-back upon the very civilization which created them. In this way, he forces us to confront the familiar yet alien cultural creatures we have become. J. F. Benjamin, Roger, and Elkin, Stephen L., eds. The Democratic State. Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1985. Pp. vii + 275. $29.95 (cloth); $12.95 (paper). The emergence of the modern democratic state raises serious concerns for the contributors to this volume of essays. Their major concerns relate to the implications of this development for liberalism and the liberal justifications of democratic government. The book's basic premise is that the growth of the autonomous state undermines the liberal justification of democracy in which the state is seen merely as "a contract for the safety, convenience and prosperity of the contracting parties" (p. 1). Given this premise, the different essays focus on the character of this new democratic state and the effects of this state on the future of politics and society. These essays testify to the fact that these issues are profoundly important and that they are, as the editors point out, insufficiently incorporated into main-</page><page sequence="10">Book Notes 897 stream studies of modern democracy. The essays of Benjamin and Duvall, Elkin, and Arneson and Ordeshook offer various analyses of the salient features of the democratic state, each emphasizing the autonomous interests of state actors and the increasing complexity of state forms and institutions. In other essays, Braybrooke and Furniss reflect, with varying degrees of optimism, on the future possibilities for a new normativejustification of the state in a liberal society. These interesting essays serve as a thoughtful reminder of the complex issues related to democracy and the modern capitalist state. J. K. Lowenthal, Richard. Social Change and Cultural Crisis. New York: Columbia University Press, 1984. Pp. viii + 252. In this collection of essays, first published in German in 1979, Richard Lowenthal presents an odd mixture of Cold War anticommunism, a firm adherence to the principles of detente, a strong belief in the soundness of the social democratic version of the welfare state, and an equally strong commitment to reformist strategies of political transformation. Lowenthal contends that a cultural crisis has befallen the West. This malaise "has . . . arisen from processes of long-term social change, because the creative reinterpretation of our basic values, and the adaptations of our norms of conduct and our institutions have not kept pace with the acceleration of those changes" (p. 39). Social Change and Cultural Crisis is an attempt to contribute to the needed reinterpretation of basic Western values. As his polemics against Habermas and Helmut Schelsky, a conservative German sociologist, evidence, Lowenthal ardently believes in social democratic reformism. Today's cultural crisis, so Lowenthal maintains, gives social democracy the chance to redefine its goals and, thus, to recapture the political initiative it has lost to its conservative challengers. Given this reviewer's opinion that social democracy is part of the problem, he is unconvinced that Lowenthal's suggestions are solutions at all. K.-K. T. Bendix, Reinhard. Force, Fate and Freedom: On Historical Sociology. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1984. Pp. xviii + 143. $11.95 (cloth). In the summer of 1981, Reinhard Bendix gave a series of public lectures as the first Max Weber Guest Professor at the University of Heidelberg. The German version was published in 1982, and this is its translation back into English. It is a brief summary of Bendix's life work, including a programmatic statement on the tasks of social science and a variety of sketches in comparative social history based on materials from his previous main studies Work and Authority in Industry, Nation-Building and Citizenship, and Kings or People. The programmatic statement identifies two theoretical attitudes in social science, historicism and rationalism. Bendix defends historicism, and its greater skepticism toward the scientific as- pirations of social studies, against views, ranging from systems theory to Marxism, whose hope it is to discover true laws of social life. The sketches in social history</page><page sequence="11">898 Ethics July 1986 are attempts to distill the essence of Bendix's previous work in this area. They center on the themes of authority and legitimation both in industry and in the state. This book will be of interest mostly as a supplement to Bendix's earlier publications. You can get in it a quick sense of what is most important in them, but it does not stand well alone. It is all but impossible to distill the essence of a social history without sounding superficial. This is a field which loses more than others when the detail is left out. The author's programmatic statements, however, are mainly useful for the understanding of his other work. On their own they, too, seem quite thin. Bendix is a great practitioner of comparative social history in the Weberian tradition, but the present book is not a good place to find this out. K. So. Staniland, Martin. What Is Political Economy? A Study of Social Theory and Under- development. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1985. Pp. xi+ 229. $18.50 (cloth). Staniland's book begins with the query, "What ... do writers mean when they refer to 'a political economy approach?"' (p. 1) and, to no one's surprise, ends with the conclusion, "There is clearly no such thing as 'the theory of political economy,' and there never will be" (p. 198). In two-hundred pages Staniland manages to briefly outline the controversy over the logical status of economics (chap. 2) as well as to review some of the literature on rational choice, corporatism, various approaches in international relations, and the Marxist debate on the state (chaps. 3-6). As the book's subtitle indicates, Staniland emphasizes the political economy literature dealing with underdevelopment. For those familiar with the field, What is Political Economy? has little to offer. However, to the uninitiated, it is a valuable introductory survey of the state of the art in the study of the political economy of underdevelopment. K.-K. T. Gellner, Ernest. Relativism in the Social Sciences. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985. Pp. viii + 200. $39.95 (cloth). At a time when positivism has become the South Africa of the intellectual world, Gellner defends it. The essence of positivism, according to Gellner, is an insistence on a granular metaphysics, a maximum separation of questions. Events can be isolated and brought to bear on our general beliefs. If the critical spirit is to have any teeth, Gellner insists that the atomisationn of information and the orderly systemisation of explanation is imperative" (p. 90). Gellner also agrees with the positivists' emphasis on science as the paradigm method of knowledge acquisition. The emergence of science introduced a radical discontinuity in human history. Relativists are fond of claiming that all knowledge is relative to particular societies and has no validity over and above them. There are "no natural kinds, there are only social kinds-and each society makes up its own" (p. 176). Prescientific societies never doubt the superiority of their beliefs. Gellner finds it a profound irony that "self-doubt has become most acute and anguished in the one civilization</page><page sequence="12">Book Notes 899 which really does know better-namely, our own" (p. 1). In the course of his book, Gellner takes on several fashionable intellectual traditions -the later work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper (Gellner classes the early work of both men as positivistic), hermeneutics, and structuralism. His prose is witty, and his criticisms frequently devastating. This is a genuinely philosophical book in which fundamental questions are addressed. Gellner's writing is not technical, but he assumes that the reader already has a broad understanding of the philosophies under investigation. D. L. H. Rosenberg, Alexander. The Structure of Biological Science. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985. Pp. xi+ 281. $37.50 (cloth); $12.95 (paper). Rosenberg presents an updated introductory text in the philosophy of biology. Originally he intended to provide a physicalist, materialist, reductionist account, but in the course of writing his book, the character of the biological theories and practice which he studied modified his conclusions to such an extent that his vindication of reductionism and materialism turned out to be somewhat hollow, and his refutation of antireductionism leaves biology with considerable strategic and methodological autonomy. Rosenberg's main conceptual tool is that of "su- pervenience," a technical notion introduced to handle the relation between such psychological concepts as fear and hunger and the physiology of the central nervous system. As it turns out, no type-type identifications can be made between psychological and physiological natural kinds. Instead, higher-level phenomena supervene on lower-level phenomena, that is, tokens can be identified such that any two objects in exactly the same circumstances with precisely the same mi- croproperties cannot have different macroproperties. Rosenberg argues that su- pervenience is the strongest relation that obtains between Mendelian genetics and molecular biology, fitness in evolutionary theory and evolutionary phenomena, as well as functional characteristics of systems and their subsystems. Rosenberg cites two main reasons why so many people continue to misconstrue evolutionary theory-the failure to see that "fitness" is a primitive term in that theory and species are not natural kinds, but spatiotemporally localized particulars (individuals). He has shown the consequences of this latter conclusion for the social sciences elsewhere (Sociobiology and the Preemption of Social Science [Baltimore and London: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1980]). D. L. H. Blalock, Hubert. Basic Dilemmas in the Social Sciences. Beverly Hills, Calif.: Sage Publications, 1984. Pp. 184. $17.95 (cloth). Blalock is a leading representative of an important group of sociologists whose main work is in causal models, methodology, and applied statistics. Their work is characterized by unusually careful attention to the problem of measurement, by the construction of highly complex causal-statistical models, and by a certain weakness of theoretical imagination. This book is Blalock's call for reform in the</page><page sequence="13">900 Ethics July 1986 social sciences. It is written in simple language and is addressed to a broad audience. It identifies two sources of the current crisis in sociology and in some other social sciences: the diversity of the researchers' intellectual backgrounds and the complexity of social reality. An adequate theory of any social phenomenon, writes Blalock, must contain at least twenty or thirty variables and must recognize multiple relations among them. The more variables, the better our understanding. Blalock recognizes only grudgingly the need for simplicity in a theory. This book will be useful for those who want an easily accessible account of the goals and frustrations of an important group of sociologists. Much that Blalock says about the state of the field is both reasonable and accurate. But it is hard to see the sort of complex statistical models he advocates as the ultimate scientific ideal in the social sciences or anywhere else. Surely complexity can be recognized and deeper understanding obtained in more fruitful ways. K. So. Condren, Conal. The Status and Appraisal of Texts: An Essay on Political Theory, Its Inheritance, and the History of Ideas. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1985. Pp. xiii + 303. $27.50 (cloth). This deconstruction of the political theory community's attributions of classic status to such works as Plato's Republic, Machiavelli's Prince, and Locke's Second Treatise is learned in substance and stylish in form, if inconclusive. Condren argues that there is no usefully definable set of perennial issues that classic texts treat, no significant "tradition" to be elicited from the texts themselves or imposed by respectable dialectic ab extra, and little or no cash value in such concepts as originality, contribution, and influence. Coherence fares better among the usual terms of appraisal, but the "sleazy" property of ambiguity contributes much more to classic status. The critique, carried on through a fresh, often witty examination of the classic texts, their idolizers, and their humanizers, is useful, though not, I think, fatal to any of the ideas attacked. Condren's final glance at current attitudes prompts a further question: Does historicist sensitivity to context indeed preclude moral appropriation of past essays in political thought, or, in bringing them down from heaven and setting them in motion, does a proper historicism render the classics more engaging, practically as well as academically? Aside from garbled passages on pages 48 and 206, the book is well printed. A. S. Mc. Skocpol, Theda, ed. Vision and Method in Historical Sociology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984. Pp. xiii+410. $39.50 (cloth); $12.95 (paper). Some of the most interesting work in contemporary social science is done by social and economic historians and historical sociologists. In the last decade this work has grown dramatically both in quantity and quality. Skocpol's book both reflects the growth and is likely to contribute to it. It contains papers given at a 1979 conference whose aim was "to further methodological reflection among a</page><page sequence="14">Book Notes 901 growing network of historical sociologists" (p. ix) by considering the work not of recognized classics such as de Tocqueville, Marx, or Weber but of more contem- porary authors, most of them still alive. The core of the book consists of chapters on Marc Bloch, Karl Polanyi, S. N. Eisenstadt, Reinhard Bendix, Perry Anderson, E. P. Thompson, Charles Tilly, Immanuel Wallerstein, and Barrington Moore. There are also two chapters by Skocpol which provide a more general context and summarize the results of the conference. While most chapters do focus on the methods used by the various authors, they also consider the more general intellectual stance of each, his agenda, and substantive conclusions. Many are written by distinguished historical sociologists cum social historians. Almost without exception, they are well crafted, well argued, and well informed. In combination they provide as thorough and complex a picture of the enterprise of historical sociology as is likely to be available from any source. For anyone interested in the current state of that enterprise, this will be an indispensable book. K. So. Smith, Steven B. Reading Althusser: An Essay on Structural Marxism. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1984. Pp. 230. $19.95 (cloth). After situating Althusser within the context of the history of Western Marxism (e.g., Lukacs, Kojeve, and Sartre), Smith offers a thorough discussion of Althusser's thought. He considers Althusser's epistemology and philosophy of science, ex- plicating key concepts and drawing parallels between Althusser and certain phi- losophers of science in the Anglo-American tradition (e.g., Feyerabend, Kuhn, and Winch). His explication of basic notions like "symptomatic reading," "prob- lematic," "epistemological break," "structural causality," and "determination in the last instance by the economy" is clear and free of the jargon that normally accompanies discussions of Althusser. Smith also distinguishes Althusser's inter- pretation of the Marxian theory of society and history (what he terms the "over- determination thesis") from its competitors within the Marxian tradition: the "fundamentalist thesis" of technological determinism (e.g., Kautsky, Plekhanov, Bukharin, and more recently, Cohen) and the "internal relatedness" thesis defended by Lukacs and, more recently, by Ollman. In addition to being clear and concise, Smith's book is focused on the thought of Althusser himself. He doesn't get involved in doctrinal disputes between Althusser and "Althusserian Marxists" (or, for that matter, other Marxists), and he is to be commended for this. T. M. Scanlon, James P. Marxism in the USSR: A Critical Survey of Current Thought. Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1985. Pp. 362. $35.00 (cloth). This is a critical survey of recent writings in "Marxist-Leninist" philosophy in the USSR. The author challenges Western stereotypes about Soviet philosophy in two respects. (1) Most Western commentators emphasize the orthodoxy of Soviet Marxism, and therefore the lack of creativity within Soviet philosophy.</page><page sequence="15">902 Ethics July 1986 Scanlon now claims that Marxism-Leninism as practiced in the Soviet Union is far from an integrated system. Despite its constricted vocabulary, in terms of substantive issues there is a fair amount of creative scholarly debate among Soviet philosophers. (2) Some Western observers think that Soviet leaders are cynical about Marxism, that Marxism-Leninism has lost its force in the USSR. In this book, Scanlon emphasizes the prominent place Marxism occupies in Soviet life, the unchallenged hegemony of Marxism-Leninism in the Soviet Union. The book offers a formidable overview of the relevant Soviet literature. The first four chapters introduce the reader to the debate about the scientific character of philosophy and summarize different interpretations of the nature of materialism, dialectics of nature, and problems of objectivity in social research. The second half of the book surveys the official positions and debates on four substantive areas: philosophy of history, social philosophy, ethics, and aesthetics. The survey of literature strongly supports Scanlon's claim about the latent pluralism in Soviet philosophy. He persuasively documents, for instance, that Soviet authors operate with such a broad and vague definition of "matter," the "primacy of the economic base," and "realism" as to allow the articulation of the most varied positions. In fact, most Soviet social philosophers are historical interactionists rather than historical materialists, properly speaking. I was less persuaded as far as intellectual creativity within Soviet Marxism is concerned. The only debate I found genuinely fascinating was the one conducted in Soviet semiotics by Iuri Lotman and his colleagues. In other fields, Soviet philosophical pluralism impressed me as a pluralism of mediocrity. I also remained somewhat skeptical about the prominence and forcefulness of Soviet Marxism. Though the hegemony of Marxism-Leninism may be unchallenged in the USSR, the collapse of the doctrine in Poland and its deep crisis in countries like China and Hungary should make us skeptical concerning its prospects in the Soviet Union, too. I. S. Schroeder, William Ralph. Sartre and His Predecessors: The Self and the Other. Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984. Pp. xv + 326. $45.00 (cloth). Sartre often misrepresented the philosophers who influenced him most. William Ralph Schroeder, in Sartre and His Predecessors: The Self and the Other, attempts to rectify this by exposition of, and lively debate with, Husserl, Heidegger, and Hegel, specifically with respect to their claims about oneself and others. He speculates about what Sartre's view might have been had he been a better interpreter of these philosophers. Schroeder's goal is not merely to set history straight, but also "to integrate the best insights of each philosopher and to fashion a new understanding of the relationships between oneself and Others" (p. ix). Schroeder provides lucid and coherent in-depth analyses, leading to an original and interesting position in which he stresses the interdependence of self and other. It is to his credit that he accomplishes this in a manner which is accessible and relevant to analytic and Continental philosophers. The major weakness of the book is that it fails to put Sartre's claims about the self and others within the context of his ontology as a whole. In particular, Schroeder does not distinguish adequately between Sartre's claims about being-for-itself, or consciousness, and the ego. Nevertheless, it is a book worth studying for it makes a contribution to</page><page sequence="16">Book Notes 903 historical scholarship on Sartre and the major influences on him, and to con- temporary philosophy of mind. L. C. Cadwallader, Eva Hauel. Searchlight on Values: Nicolai Hartmann's Twentieth-Century Value Platonism. New York: University Press of America, 1984. Pp. xxvi + 207. $22.50 (cloth); $11.25 (paper). The author finds in Hartmann a variety of value Platonism which is immune from what she regards as the most common objections to the position. In particular, she shows how Hartmann's multidimensional value pluralism allows him to escape the charge that belief in ontologically real value ideals invariably leads to bigotry and narrowminded cultural chauvinism. Although she primarily wishes to open value Platonism to fresh scrutiny and to make Hartmann accessible to analytically inclined Anglo-American philosophers, the question of the truth of Hartmann's position pervades the book. For that we find in the last chapter a cautious but strong defense. Cadwallader attributes to Hartmann a pragmatist criterion for ontology. Since we must take account of value ideals in our living, we should regard them as real. That is the same criterion we use to vindicate belief in the existence of perceptual objects, so Hartmann's theory displays theoretical economy. Thus the author replies to those who charge that value Platonism uneconomically populates the universe with mysterious objects. William H. Werkmeister's introduction nicely places Hartmann's Ethics in the wider context of his later works on ontology and aesthetics. J. B. S. Turner, Stephen, and Factor, Regis. Max Weber and the Dispute over Reason and Value: A Study of Philosophy, Ethics and Politics. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984. Pp. ix+ 274. $29.95 (cloth). This book traces the history of the arguments for and against Max Weber's conception of the relation between rational knowledge and values. It is, as the authors put it, "an attempt to provide, through comparison and explication, enough intellectual distance between Weber and present commonplaces so that serious rethinking is possible" (p. 5). The first task is to debunk the now conventional view of these matters, based as it is partly on distortion, partly on selective perception, and partly on a domestication of Weber's views. Turner and Factor put emphasis on Weber's political doctrines and on the political context within which he operated. Weber's "decisionism," his defense of the fact-value distinction and his commitment to German national power as the ultimate value are seen as part of an overall coherent position. The book then traces the history of critiques, defenses, and misunderstandings of that position. It begins with various disputes in Weimar Germany: Scheler, Lowith, Jaspers, and Heidegger were the main figures. Weber is then transferred to England and America through the work of Morgenthau, Schumpeter, and Mannheim as well as Parsons and Bendix. The transfer of the debate also changes it as the Weberian tradition encounters</page><page sequence="17">904 Ethics July 1986 logical positivism and pragmatism. More recently, critiques of the Weberian position come from the Frankfurt school, especially Horkheimer, Marcuse, and Habermas, from Leo Strauss and his students, and in various attempts to "re- habilitate" moral deliberation, as in the works of Finnis on natural law and Rawls or Daniels on the method of ethics. Turner and Factor's book covers the history of these debates with an impressive breadth and depth of scholarship and with clarity and succinctness. This book should be of special interest to all those unhappy with the Weberian legacy in modern social science and in contemporary morality. K. So. Glassman, Ronald, and Murvar, Vatro, eds. Max Weber's Political Sociology: A Pessimistic Vision of a Rationalized World. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1984. Pp. viii + 295. $35.00 (cloth). All but one of the fourteen essays in this volume were presented originally at the Max Weber Colloquium held at William Patterson College in October 1980. They divide into four subject groups. Chapters by Gerth, Factor and Turner, and Kilker focus on Weber's politics, his views of democracy, liberalism, German history, and current events. Chapters by Wrong, Scaff, and Tar discuss various aspects of the relation between Weber, Marx, and various Marxists (e.g., Lukacs). Essays by Casanova, Bologh, and Antonio take up the subject of rationalization as the central unifying theme of Weber's work. Finally Lyman, Swatos, and Glassman write about various aspects of charisma and charismatic authority. Reinhard Bendix provides a brief prologue under the title "What Max Weber Means to Me," and Vatro Murvar writes an epilogue about Weber's analyses of Russia. It is not made clear why that should be an appropriate epilogue for a book about Weber. As with most such collections, this one is of uneven quality. But most of the chapters are either too short, or too specialized, or simply not well enough thought through. Some of the better essays will be of interest to Weber specialists, no doubt. The book, however, cannot really be recommended to anyone else. K. So. Mommsen, Wolfgang J. Max Weber and German Politics, 1890-1920. Translated by Michael S. Steinberg. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985. Pp. xxi+498. $50.00 (cloth). Max Weber did not bestride his times like the Colossus; thus, this recent translation of Mommsen's controversial study is not a heroic biography, nor does it simply reveal the historical context of Weber's thought. Rather, we see Weber's positions on the major issues of Wilhelmine and early Weimar Germany as drawn from essays, speeches, and correspondence. Weber's political views, Mommsen argues, flowed from two main sources: a deep commitment to the liberal values of individualism, dignity, and integrity; and an almost Bismarckian determination to see Germany become a world power. (The latter source, as embarrassing to Weberians as "Die Judenfrage" is to Marxists, is the main point of controversy.)</page><page sequence="18">Book Notes 905 Mommsen weaves these values with Weber's advocacy of the bourgeoisie's wresting of power from a dilettante emperor and from a declining agrarian order, his support for worker strikes but opposition to governmental regulation of factories, and his view that only through parliamentary democracy could Germany take its rightful place in the world order. Mommsen concludes with an essay comparing his position to Marxian, psychoanalytic, and other interpretations of Weber and his politics. We are left with an image of a man motivated by the antagonistic passions of humanism and imperialism, whose impact on his times was limited but whose keen gift for exposing hypocrisy and sham made him as constant as the North Star. B. M. D. Adamson, Walter L. Marx and the Disillusionment of Marxism. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985. Pp. x + 258. $25.50 (cloth). Marxism, Walter Adamson suggests, has become "disillusioned," not in the sense that its ideas have been shown to be outdated, or its ideals chimerical, but in the sense that it has, or should, shed its illusions. The proletariat is not, after all, the universal class; nor is the Soviet Union or any other "socialist" country the last best hope of mankind; nor is the revolution just around the corner. Quite the contrary, in fact. Adamson's book might have been titled (a la Richard Rorty) Marxism without Mirrors or Marxism without Foundations. Adamson finds fault with the "foundationalist" assumptions of Marxism, which he seeks to resituate as a particularly cogent and compelling voice in an ongoing conversation about the human prospect. Discerning disparate strands within Marx's own theorizing, Adamson attempts to sort these out and to supply his own rather distinctively hermeneutical synthesis. "Marxism," he writes, "deserves our most serious con- sideration insofar as it teaches us how to interpret social and historical reality." He omits to mention that Marx's Eleventh Thesis on Feuerbach counsels precisely the opposite course. Not recognizably "Marxist," but first-rate, anyway. T. B. Nielsen, H. A. Where the Passion Is: A Reading of Kierkegaard's "Philosophical Fragments." Gainesville: Florida State University Press/University Presses of Florida, 1983. Pp. x + 209. $20.00 (cloth). Many commentators will put any scholarly question between themselves and the task of forming an opinion on a scabrous passage. Not H. A. Nielsen. Aside from glancing references to the Postscript, Nielsen virtually steps into the Fragments and closes the door behind him. There is no real attempt to situate this mighty volume in the parade of philosophical or, for that matter, Kierkegaardian ideas. Yes, Wittgenstein is made to comment on S. K.'s understanding of sacral language, and Kant is presented as a foil, but all along the reader is enjoined to stick to the text. While frugal in his chapter-by-chapter summaries, Nielsen is prodigal in elucidating Kierkegaard's religion outside the limits of reason. For those who have ears to hear, the Fragments is a font of hard sayings, e.g., we are in Error,</page><page sequence="19">906 Ethics July 1986 that is, helplessly in love with it. In seminar style, Nielsen interprets all such claims and then takes up the argument against himself. When the dialectics are over, Kierkegaard's words ring clearer and just as offensive. One finds a hiatus here and Nielsen tossed there; nevertheless, like precious few studies, Where the Passion Is does not call for another turn in Kierkegaard's grave. It is a welcome rara avis. G. D. M. Heidegger, Martin. Schelling's Treatise on the Essence of Human Freedom. Translated by Joan Stambaugh. Athens: Ohio University Press, 1985. Pp. viii+ 195. $26.95 (cloth); $14.95 (paper). In our age, when "liberation" has become the watchword of political action, surprisingly little thought is given to the meaning of freedom. But then, action requires decision and not reflection. The problematic character of freedom, however, thereby all too often goes unseen. Perhaps no one in modern times has more profoundly considered this problem than Schelling, who, in his Treatise on the Essence of Human Freedom, tries to construct a rational system on the basis of freedom alone, which leads to the rather disheartening recognition of the necessary connection of freedom and evil. Heidegger brings Schelling's thought to life in a magnificent manner in the lectures contained in this volume. The work, however, is more than a commentary and points to the hidden essence of Heidegger's own thought in the connection of Being to absolute freedom. Straightforwardly written and ably translated, this is an excellent introduction to Schelling and Heidegger that also takes us to the heart of darkness that dwells in the unthought essence of those ideas and principles for which we live and for which we often are willing to die. M. A. G. De Tocqueville, Alexis. Selected Letters on Politics and Society. Edited by Roger Boesche and translated by James Toupin and Roger Boesche. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1985. Pp. xiv + 417. $24.95 (cloth). This book is a needed contribution to the Tocqueville materials now available in translation. Excepting the correspondence with Gobineau, Tocqueville's letters have not appeared in English since the translation of Beaumont's collection more than a century ago. Boesche's collection consists of 104 letters, 102 from Tocque- ville's hand and 2 addressed to him from Beaumont. Well over half of these have never appeared in English. While those familiar with Tocqueville's voluminous correspondence will find some important letters not included (several to J. S. Mill come to mind), Boesche has brought a keen eye and sensitivity to Tocqueville's concerns to the task of selection. Boesche has wisely kept his introductory remarks to a minimum and appended brief and helpful biographical sketches of Tocqueville's correspondents. Tocqueville's most important letters were, for the most part, confined to a select</page><page sequence="20">Book Notes 907 circle which was remarkably enduring over the years and which gives his letters something of the character of conversation. As this collection so admirably demonstrates, Tocqueville's correspondence is more than a commentary on his work; it is itself a part of the substance of that work, providing also crucial indications of mood and method. This volume will further establish Tocqueville's importance as a profound theorist and critic of modernity. B. J. S. Smith, Bruce James. Politics and Remembrance: Republican Themes in Machiavelli, Burke, and Tocqueville. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1985. Pp. xii + 287. $27.50 (cloth). In this well-crafted book, Bruce Smith sets out to probe the "mysteries of political action." His theme is the interdependence of active political life and the capacity of a people to nourish both freedom and reverence for authority. It is Smith's insistence that freedom is nourished by genuine piety, rather than compromised by it, that gives the book an unusual and distinctive stance. The book's most original and provocative section is the final chapter, which argues that both freedom and political equality stem from the citizen's sense of "possessing and being possessed by a public thing." This experience is the root of piety and the foundation of authority and is, in turn, sustained by republican institutions which provide the setting for "the narration of political life." Smith develops and sustains his main thesis by fresh and, at points, striking readings of Machiavelli, Burke, and Tocqueville, all of whom shared the awareness that public freedom is fragile and requires citizens' ability to recapture for themselves the spirit of freedom which marks the beginning of republican experiments. Smith's book is a notable restatement of that same spirit. W. M. S. Welch, Cheryl B. Liberty and Utility: The French Ideologues and the Transformation of Liberalism. New York: Columbia University Press, 1984. Pp. ix+ 289. $30.00 (cloth). Cheryl B. Welch illuminates the contours of the liberalism of the French Ideologues. Welch argues that the Ideologues, in response to the excesses which emerged from the linguistic vagaries of the Rights of Man, sought to alter the ground of the liberal polity from natural rights to social utility. It is this transformation and the subsequent fate of ideologie that Welch traces through the work of several theorists, most notably Destutt de Tracy. Framed by historical chapters, the heart of Welch's study is an analysis of the Ideological viewpoint-the combining of a sensationalist psychology and a moral theory of self-interest with economic liberalism and representative democracy. Welch pays special attention to the Ideologues' search for scientific bases for political action before discussing their political theory and comparing ideologie with Benthamite utilitarianism. Welch concludes with a discussion of the disin-</page><page sequence="21">908 Ethics July 1986 tegration of the Ideological perspective that has much to say about the intellectual origins of French socialism. Welch is at her best when examining certain enduring vantage points in French liberalism and the metamorphoses such vantage points underwent. In attempting to establish the utilitarian pedigree of the Ideologues, however, Welch sometimes loses sight of the distinctively French elements in idologie-the relation between its revolutionary origins and the fatal hiatus between theorie and pratique. As a result, Welch does not directly confront the problem her study presses- namely, the failure of French liberalism. B. J. S. Miller, James. Rousseau: Dreamer of Democracy. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1984. Pp. xii+272. $25.00 (cloth). James Miller has written an ambitious book in which he attempts to restore Rousseau as the "decisive theorist" of modern democracy. Rousseau's meaning and political significance are revealed, according to Miller, less in the "clinical language" of the Social Contract than in the "poetic evocations" of such works as the Second Discourse and La Nouvelle H&amp;loise. Miller argues that Rousseau's conception of the ideal polity emerged from "vivid scenes of Geneva," both real and imagined, and that his contribution to democratic theory can only be gauged by taking account of the interplay of image and argument in his work. The dialectical quality of Miller's method gives his book a complexity of structure in which some elements are more successful than others. The first half examines Rousseau's relation to Geneva, beginning with a wonderful chapter on "reverie." In this first part, Miller weaves biography and exegesis together so as to "show how" Rousseau created his political vision. Although Miller might have said more about the democratic implications of "reverie," and developed the tensions between Rousseau's pastoral and political images more fully, Miller's method and conclusions are original and provocative. The second half considers Rousseau as revolutionary icon. In Rousseau's reveries, the modem "transvaluation" of democracy is accomplished. Here, however, Miller's emphasis on imagery obscures Rousseau's deep ambivalence toward modernity and permits Miller to paint Rousseau, rather too easily, as the "chief architect" of 1789. This work is, nonetheless, a fine contribution to Rousseau scholarship and a suggestive inquiry into the origins of modern democratic thought. B. J. S. Hont, Istvan, and Ignatieff, Michael, eds. Wealth and Virtue: The Shaping of Political Economy in the Scottish Enlightenment. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983. Pp. ix+ 371. $59.50 (cloth). This collection of thirteen new essays arose out of a colloquium held at Cambridge in May 1979. The essays constitute an interesting but highly uneven contribution to an ongoing scholarly debate over the "intellectual roots" of the science of political economy as developed by eighteenth-century Scottish philosophers. Most useful in my view are John Pocock's essay suggesting that both "civic humanist"</page><page sequence="22">Book Notes 909 and "natural law" traditions may have influenced Scottish political economy, even if each tradition is conveniently studied in isolation to clarify its "tunnel view" of events; John Robertson's ambitious attempt to synthesize themes from both traditions in a distinct interpretation of the rise of Scottish economic thought (particularly as found in Hume); and Donald Winch's essay casting doubt on civic humanist approaches to Smith's Wealth of Nations in favor of an alternative approach which emphasizes continuity with the natural jurisprudence tradition and yet which also finds room for the uniqueness of Smith's personal vision. The remaining essays are not without insights (especially regarding lesser-known Scottish writers such as Carmichael, Fletcher, Lord Kames, and Millar), but the editors' introductory piece and John Dunn's essay must be judged disappointing. A general caveat is that most of the contributors (with the notable exception of Winch) apparently take it for granted that "collective context" is of overriding importance for understanding Scottish Enlightenment economic ideas. But serious consideration should be given to the competing hypothesis that political economy is largely shaped by its own "internal logic," given that its basic premises about human psychology are invariant with respect to moral and legal contexts. For better or worse, political economists (including the classical Scottish variety) may generally view their work as a body of "scientific deductions" whose formal va- lidity (if not practical appeal) is quite independent of "external" intellectual influences. J. R. Fogelin, Robert J. Hume's Skepticism in the 'Treatise of Human Nature.' London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1985. Pp. xii+ 195. $25.00 (cloth). Since Norman Kemp Smith's classic study, much recent Hume scholarship over- emphasizes Hume's naturalism and, as a result, Fogelin claims, misrepresents the systematic importance and radical character of Hume's skepticism. To redress this imbalance, Fogelin argues for the following (now) controversial theses. (1) Hume accepts an unmitigated epistemological skepticism. (2) Hume recommends forming only a moderate skepticism as the "causal product of two competing influences": Pyrrhonian doubt and natural instinct. (3) Hume employs both antecedent (a priori) and consequent (empirical) skeptical arguments, employing the former when addressing reason and induction and the latter in discussing perception and morality. While it has been shown how a moderate skepticism complements Hume's naturalistic program, Fogelin's aim is to show that throughout Hume's Treatise his radical skepticism and naturalism are "mutually supportive." Fogelin wisely resists the perennial temptation to explicate and evaluate Hume's arguments apart from their textual and philosophical setting. In addition to the topics usually associated with Hume's skepticism, chapters on Bayle's skepticism regarding extension and Hume's natural history of philosophy are included. Significant features of Reid's criticism of Hume are reassessed. This clearly written study is an important challenge to what in many circles remains the standard interpretation of Hume. C. Co.</page><page sequence="23">910 Ethics July 1986 Spinoza [Baruch (Benedict de)]. The Collected Works of Spinoza, vol. 1. Edited and translated by Edwin Curley. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1985. Pp. xx+ 727. $45.00 (cloth). This is the first installment of what will soon be a two-volume complete Spinoza in English translation. Organized chronologically, this volume takes us up to late 1665 and includes the Emendation of the Intellect, the Short Treatise, the exposition of Descartes's Principles, and the Ethics, together with translations of all of the extant letters both to and from Spinoza in the period. The translations are based on the standard Gebhardt edition of Spinoza's writings, Spinoza Opera (4 vols. [Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1925]) and are keyed to volume, page, and line of that edition. But in the notes and introductions, Curley makes clear that he has also made use of the very latest textual studies and editions available. The translations are very careful and accurate, and the notes provide important discussions of textual and interpretative problems, with reference to the best secondary literature in English, French, German, and Dutch. One hundred pages of a glossary-index allow the reader to trace connections between Spinoza's Latin and Dutch ter- minology and Curley's English translation. While it will be a great help to the student, this volume is also a major contribution to Spinoza scholarship in any language and sets a new standard for edition and translation in Anglo-American studies in the history of philosophy. D. E. G. Delahunty, R. J. Spinoza. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1985. Pp. xvi + 317. $49.95 (cloth). This is a volume in the series, The Arguments of the Philosophers. Like most of its companions in this series, the volume aims for a reasonably comprehensive overview of the philosopher chosen, with the emphasis on the arguments. Delahunty begins with three chapters on Spinoza's epistemology, drawn largely from the Treatise on the Improvement of the Intellect and the Ethics, part 2. After that, the book follows the order of the Ethics, from God through minds, bodies, the emotions to freedom, eternity, and immortality, treating most of the main questions Spinoza takes up there. Unfortunately missing is any extended account of Spinoza's critique of revealed religion, and missing altogether is Spinoza's political thought. While Delahunty attempts to provide some historical context, his heart is obviously in the careful examination of the arguments, and on this he does a good, work- manlike job. The book should serve as a useful introduction to Spinoza's thought for a wide range of readers, from the philosophically sophisticated undergraduate on up. D. E. G. Singer, Irving. The Nature of Love. Vol. 1: Plato to Luther, 2d ed. Vol. 2: Courtly and Romantic. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984. Vol 1: Pp. xiii + 381. $20.00 (cloth). Vol. 2: Pp. xv+ 513. $25.00 (cloth). These two volumes (of a projected three) cover an enormous range of history, literature, and philosophy, and cover it with intelligence and passion. The main</page><page sequence="24">Book Notes 911 organizing theme contrasts the classical tradition of eros and philia with the Judeo-Christian tradition of nomos and agape. The first emphasizes a more or less objective appraisal, and the other a creative or even gratuitous bestowal of value. Singer examines both the contrast and the possibility of a synthesis. To understand love as an ideal and as a psychological state, Singer invokes an analysis of love in which our ideas about the emotion (seen as a way of valuing) and its possible objects (especially the Good, God, idealized human beings, and real ones) help shape and constitute the state. Thus, as our self-understanding and our appreciation of what is of value develop, the nature of love changes. Singer traces major stages in the development. The conflict between what he calls realist and idealist views of love is rooted in a dialectic of instinctual need, with its biological imperatives, and creative imagination, with its quest for the magic of merging. While particular claims and readings are open to question, the panoramic sweep of the work makes it impressive and valuable. J. N. Sorensen, Villy. Seneca: The Humanist at the Court of Nero. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984. Pp. 352. $25.00 (cloth). Anyone interested in the life and times of Seneca will undoubtedly find much of interest in Villy Sorensen's book. Most of Sorensen's 330-page book is actually devoted to (1) Roman history before and during the life of Seneca, (2) the lives of Caligula and Nero, and (3) the life of Seneca. Seneca's literary works are covered in about 125 pages, and, as Sorensen devotes about fifty of those pages to Seneca's tragedies, the philosophical writings are covered in a scant seventy- five pages. Not surprisingly, these constitute the weakest part of the book: Sorensen brings very little philosophical analysis or insight to bear on Seneca's peculiar brand of Stoicism and is normally content to summarize the various essays and epistles while relating them (often inappropriately) to various fashionable Con- tinental philosophers: Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Hegel, Heidegger, Sartre, and so forth. More disturbing, however, is that Sorensen is oblivious to the fact that Seneca's Stoicism is a very peculiar brand of Stoicism, one which often contradicts and perverts various key doctrines of the original Stoic thinkers. Unless one is cognizant of this fact, however, it is difficult to arrive at a proper understanding of Seneca's philosophical position and significance. G. S. Aristotle. Nicomachean Ethics. Translated by Terence Irwin. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Co., 1985. Pp. xxvii+ 441. $19.50 (cloth); $6.75 (paper). This translation gives a good deal more help to those engaged in the study of Aristotle's work than any other presently available in English. One of its greatest advantages is the extensive supplementary material Irwin has included: eighty- four pages of notes, a forty-seven-page glossary, and several pages of suggestions for further reading. The notes and glossary will be useful not only to beginning or advanced students, but to scholars and teachers as well. Within the text itself,</page><page sequence="25">912 Ethics July 1986 Irwin has taken the radical step of adding to the conventional segmentation of Aristotle's work into books and chapters. We now also have smaller sections, each with its own number and heading (e.g., "7.104 The deficiency corresponding to incontinence"). The translation stays close to Aristotle's Greek and reads smoothly enough. The liberal use of square brackets for the translator's interpolations will indicate to the reader how spare Aristotle's Greek often is. At times, whole sentences are interpolated to make the thought more intelligible. In general, the translation sticks to the conventional Greek-English correspondences: "happiness" for eudaimonia, "virtue" for arete, "temperance" for sophrosune, etc. But there are some innovations as well: "decision" replaces "choice" for prohairesis, "intelligence" replaces "practical wisdom" for phronesis, and "fine" replaces "noble" for kalon. Hackett has performed a fine service for us by producing a sturdy, well-designed, and inexpensive edition of this outstanding translation. R. K. Plato. The Being of the Beautiful: Plato's Theaetetus, Sophist, and Statesman. Translated and with commentary by Seth Benardete. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984. Pp. li+ 539. $42.50 (cloth). Benardete's translations are intended to be strictly literal. Wherever possible, a particular Greek word will be rendered by the same English word in different contexts, even if English idiom is thereby strained. Plato's syntax and word order are faithfully preserved even if the resulting English is less easy to read. Plato's flowing, flexible, and deceptively colloquial Greek thus becomes somewhat stilted and cumbersome; his stylistic lesson, that penetrating philosophy does not require impenetrable prose, is consequently blurred. Nonetheless, the gains are substantial for those who wish to get Plato's precise meaning clear-Benardete is certainly less tendentious than Cornford, for instance. He will be most useful for those with some knowledge of Greek already who are looking for a helpful 'crib.' The translation of each dialogue is followed by an extensive interpretative commentary. In true Straussian manner, the lines, having been meticulously translated, are then read between with little concern for hard evidence and much room allowed for imaginative reconstruction of hidden meanings. Great weight is placed on the form and dramatic context, usually ignored for these dialogues. There is no reference, either in the commentary or in the few brief notes, to modern scholar- ship or alternative interpretations of the arguments. The introduction is largely taken up with a long account of the Hippias Major on the grounds that its subject, the beautiful, provides the theme which links the three dialogues translated. R. G. M. Burger, Ronna. "The Phaedo": A Platonic Labyrinth. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1984. Pp. ix+ 288. $25.00 (cloth). This work is a detailed examination of Plato's Phaedo, in the form of a commentary. The whole dialogue is segmented into thirteen units, and a separate chapter is devoted to each. The author adopts the method of interpretation advocated by</page><page sequence="26">Book Notes 913 Leo Strauss: the platonic dialogue is regarded not as a treatise but as a dramatic conversation in which no single speech or character represents Plato's teaching. According to this approach, the speeches of Socrates may be known by Plato to be unsound; for the use of irony allows Socrates to conceal from his interlocuters what the reader may uncover-by giving to various hints and literary devices the proper emphasis. For example, Burger finds it significant that the Phaedo's first word is autos (in this context, meaning "yourself"). This, Burger believes, "identifies the self with the living being, without implying any separation of psyche from body" (p. 7). The dialogue's message is that we should neither identify with the body alone (the hedonist's mistake) nor with the separated soul (the philosopher's mistake). Though the various arguments presented in the dialogue for the im- mortality of the soul fail, that, according to Burger, is precisely their intention. Those who accept Strauss's interpretive strategy will find much to value in this work. Others will wonder: "How submerged does a reference have to be before it drowns?" Julian Barnes, Flaubert's Parrot [New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1984]). R. K. Fisher, Louis. Constitutional Conflicts between Congress anid the President. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1985. Pp. xviii + 372. $40.00 (cloth); $8.95 (paper). This book is a substantial extension of a 1978 book. It deals with the constitutional and political history of significant constitutional conflicts. These conflicts include the appointment and removal of federal officials by the president, presidential legislative powers, the history of legislative and executive vetoes, congressional investigations, impeachment, executive privilege, expenditures, treaties and ex- ecutive agreements, and the war power. The book's tremendous scope, however, is matched by the soundness of the scholarship and judgments reflected there. The earlier version of the book was selected as one of the six most valuable books for new members of Congress. That is an accurate measure of the high value of the book. It deserves to be included in the personal library of serious scholars and political observers. The history discussed in the book is often necessary to understand great constitutional controversies. One is surprised to discover the rarity and trivial nature of secret funding by Congress during the entire nineteenth century. A. S. Loh, Wallace D. Social Research in the Judicial Process: Cases, Readings, and Text. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 1984. Pp. xxix+ 778. $37.50 (cloth). Let's begin with a typical chapter: a case study of the death penalty. Following an introductory section on the historical scope of capital offenses, the history of statutory reform and repeal, and the nature of judicial challenges, Loh presents the equal protection challenges (Marvin Wolfgang's research, Maxwell v. Bishop), the due process challenges (Witherspoon v. Illinois, Hovey v. Superior Court of Alameda County), the Eighth Amendment challenges (Furman v. Georgia, public opinion</page><page sequence="27">914 Ethics July 1986 on the death penalty, Gregg v. Georgia, the deterrent effect of capital punishment), and so on. Loh fashions a skillful amalgamation of text, judicial case opinion, empirical research studies, and notes and questions-the fine print, or "connective tissue," binding these diverse readings. Extensive references are furnished. This vigorous procedure is followed in eleven large chapters ranging from case studies in Southern and Northern school desegregation, the judicial exclu- sionary rule, and jury selection and function, to perspectives on psycholegal research, the judicial process, and the relation of social research to the judicial process. While the number of topics is small in relation to the size of the book, each topic is examined thoroughly, from a variety of perspectives. Loh's casebook is an ambitious project. While it is aimed at both law and social science students, it will appeal to a wider audience as a useful sourcebook. Loh's brisk prose, assiduous editing, and varied typographical format contribute to the book's appeal. B. G. H. Channels, Noreen L. Social Science Methods in the Legal Process. Totowa, N.J.: Rowman &amp; Allanheld, 1985. Pp. x+276. $39.95 (cloth). Noreen Channels's book is intended as a resource with which legal professionals can apply the methods of social science to legal proceedings. The ten chapters "cover all aspects of a research project from the initial posing of an empirical question through the data gathering and the analysis stage" (p. 1). The first two chapters briefly discuss the history and uses of social science in legal transactions and a comparison of legal and scientific analyses and objectives. Chapters 3-9 provide an exposition of standard research methods of the social sciences, including the nature and types of research questions; research design and validity; population identification and sampling; types, evaluation, and validity of measurements; data collection; and differential and inferential statistical methods. Throughout these chapters a recurring theme is the concept of control, a device for refuting rival explanations of a given set of data. While, for the most part, the book is a useful presentation of orthodox methodological questions and techniques, one theme remains unsettling. Although the final chapter, "Collaboration between Lawyers and Social Scientists," recognizes the incompatibility of the aims of the lawyer as adversary and the social scientist as (relatively) objective truth seeker, Channels's proposed solutions (the social scientist is an expert who works in clearly specified ways for, or is consultant to, the attorney rather than the attorney's client) seem less than satisfactory on both practical and theoretical grounds. Should scientists 'work for' lawyers or courts at all? B. G. H. Barnett, Larry D., and Reed, Emily F. Law, Society, and Population: Issues in a New Field. Houston: Cap and Gown Press, 1985. Pp. xv+ 186. $29.95 (cloth). This book advances the thesis that court cases dealing with the constitutionality of government action vis-a'-vis population issues (fertility, mortality, migration,</page><page sequence="28">Book Notes 915 etc.) can be explained and predicted on the basis of social forces affecting societal structure. While the conclusions reached are far from definitive, owing, in part, to the inherent limitations of sociology, the book does establish the material requirements which the contents of the premisses of an explanatory theory in this field ought to satisfy. Hence, the book's primary value lies in advancing regulative principles for the study of court decisions concerning demographic processes. The book's chief failings are in neglecting to address canonical issues in judicial decision making, in ignoring the individual makeup of the Supreme Court, and in overemphasizing the impact of social forces on legal decisions. In what is perhaps the most interesting chapter, the authors predict, on the basis of sociological data, that within the next ten years the Supreme Court will require State validation of homosexual marriages. In reaching this conclusion, they un- derestimate the role of religious tradition in American life and the impact of AIDS on this subculture. J.G. H. Fawcett, J. E. S. Outer Space: New Challenges to Law and Policy. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984. Pp. vi+ 169. $24.95 (cloth). This little book by a distinguished scholar is the best treatment of the subject now available. It deals in succession with legal issues in the following areas: telecommunications, remote sensing, energy sources in outer space, the use of space stations, and the military uses of outer space. The complex problems involved are described succinctly, difficulties are not glossed over, and the judgments of the author are wise and judicious, reflecting his long experience of the law. His general conclusions are that "the complexity of space operations, and the difficulties of regulating them at so many different levels, are manifest, and perhaps no human activity has ever been so basically international. Much has still to be done, in the common interests of all countries and their peoples, to secure outer space practices across all frontiers, not least proper control of military uses of outer space.... The opportunities and dangers of space operations are together without precedent in history" (pp. 121-22). "But in the principal influences at work there are obstacles to progress and time is running out" (p. 116). If one puts, on one side, the complexities of the legal problems involved and the necessity of harmonizing the conflicting principles and, on the other side, the enormous pressures produced by the continuing march of technology, the clamour of special interests, the play of domestic politics, and, above all, the deadly poison of continuing political tensions between the superpowers, one should not be sanguine about the possibilities for a sensible solution. The capacity of states for egregious folly seems insatiable. C. B. J. Verba, Sidney, and Orren, Gary R. Equality in America: The View from the Top. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1985. Pp. x+ 334. $22.00 (cloth); $12.50 (paper). This book reports on a survey of diverse national and local leaders conducted by the Washington Post and Harvard University in 1976. The book emphasizes</page><page sequence="29">916 Ethics July 1986 three points: (1) values are important in shaping political attitudes; (2) leaders' values shape national policies; and (3) there is an uneasy balance between American support for equality in politics (one person, one vote) and equality of economic opportunity (the same rules for all) and rejection of equality of economic results (income limits, hiring quotas). The most interesting part of the book is the analysis in chapter 4 of how leaders can believe in both equal opportunity and a system that produces unequal results. The link is the notion of just deserts: those at the bottom must be there because of their failures. The methodological procedure by which the authors illustrate this point and the political implications they derive from it are worthy of our attention. The book is filled with numbers and tables, but at times the data are only weakly related to the focus of the book. There are, for instance, few attempts to study factors other than "values" as causes of attitudes. There is little evidence available from the survey for studying the importance of leaders' attitudes in shaping political decisions. The importance of the issues raised and the authors' findings, however, recommend this book, especially for specialists in the literature. G. T. Eisenstadt, S. N., and Ahimeir, Ora, eds. The Welfare State and Its Aftermath. Totowa, N.J.: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1985. Pp. x+329. $27.50 (cloth). This book is a collection of papers presented at a seminar held in Jerusalem in May 1983. Twenty-three scholars and experts from ten countries, so S. N. Eisenstadt writes in the introduction, assembled "to assess the achievements, hopes and criticisms of the welfare state, the calls for reevaluation of the path of democratic society, and the role of welfare services in shaping social policies in the post- welfare state era" (p. 7). Given the format of The Welfare State and Its Aftermath, its overall quality is expectedly quite uneven. The most useful essays are those in parts 1 and 2. They deal with the history of, and with the contemporary controversy over, the welfare state. The writings in part 3 discuss the welfare state's institutional aspects. The different welfare policy experiences in Scandinavia, Austria, Switzerland, Japan, France, Great Britain, and the United States are the subject of part 4. Part 5 contains papers on the Israeli welfare state. Without exception, the authors included in this volume are either liberal defenders of the welfare state or its free-market critics. Marxist criticisms of the welfare state are notably and regrettably absent. K.-K. T. Turner, Jonathan H., and Musick, David. American Dilemmas: A Sociological Inter- pretation of Enduring Social Issues. New York: Columbia University Press, 1985. Pp. xi+ 375. $40.00 (cloth); $15.00 (paper). This book is a cross between an advanced undergraduate textbook and a let- liberal polemic, and it only partially succeeds in completing both agendas. Its problem is hinted at in the preface: the authors reject our "conservative times" and "utilitarian ... domination of] our thinking about . .. social issues," but</page><page sequence="30">Book Notes 917 substitute only the rather bland formulation that "both the definition and the substance of social issues are lodged in cultural and social forces." The book continues in this vein through an examination of the left's standard list of social problems-"the contradictions of capitalism," racism, sexism, pollution, and so on. The message and rhetoric are a little too heated for a textbook, although perfectly appropriate for a polemic; at the same time, the substance is too formulaic and thin spread for a rousing polemic, although perfectly appropriate for a textbook. Thus the book falls between two stools, and it is hard to see just who its audience will be. This conclusion is unfortunate, because American Dilemmas contains a lot of useful and nonobvious information and has some insightful comments. Perhaps its most valuable contribution is its refreshing refusal to mimic Pollyanna; it insists, and convincingly demonstrates, that the problems it discusses often have no solutions, at least in the sense that Americans are unwilling to pay the financial and other costs necessary to solve them. Few authors, and especially few textbook authors, are able to maintain such ambiguity and for this, if nothing else, the authors deserve a wider audience than they are likely to receive. J. L. H. Dougherty, Charles. Ideal, Fact, and Medicine: A Philosophy for Health Care. New York: University Press of America, 1985. Pp. iii + 203. $22.75 (cloth); $8.75 (paper). Dougherty begins his philosophy for health care with a phenomenology of moral experience and ethical reflection from which he adduces an overarching principle for public policy and individual decision making in medicine: practical personal autonomy within progressive societies. Central to his thesis is the conviction that the facts of medical science and technology must be interpreted, evaluated, and directed in light of the ideal enshrined in his overarching principle. Practical personal autonomy furnishes both the goals and the conditions according to which medical expertise is to be addressed. Thus, medical expertise must be designed to enhance practical autonomy, but such expertise must be controlled by a respect for human dignity and human rights, along with the rights of informed consent, informational privacy, "democracy" within the institutional settings of health care, and patient participation in the healing process. Such rights are designed to protect the patient from paternalism or manipulation for utilitarian purposes. But Dougherty's phenomenology is sufficiently "social" so as to permit genuine considerations of the social benefits of medical research, benefits that could enhance the practical personal autonomy of others now and in the future. Thus, he balances an awareness of moral ideals, intractable facts, individual rights, and social needs in a commendable fashion. R. B. M. Coppenger, Mark. Bioethics: A Casebook. Englewood Cliffs, NJ.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1985. Pp. xv+ 206. $12.95 (paper). Mark Coppenger's Bioethics: A Casebook is an unneeded addition to the rapidly growing market of bioethics textbooks. It is a relatively short book consisting</page><page sequence="31">918 Ethics July 1986 exclusively of legal cases in which bioethical issues are exemplified. While the selected cases are for the most part interesting, they are poorly organized (the Quinlan case is subsumed under the chapter on "informed consent") and unbalanced (the chapter on "privacy" contains but three cases), and the brief introductions to the topics are rather shallow. It is Coppenger's belief that by examining actual legal cases, the student will sense an immediacy otherwise lacking in other cases, real or hypothetical. The impression, however, is that bioethics is uniquely a legal problem-an impression Coppenger takes pains to disclaim. He includes, however, a glossary of esoteric legal terms (writ of mandamus, amicus curiae) which he thinks is needed to understand the cases. I do not see why anyone teaching bioethics (and his book is intended for pedagogical use) would use this book in lieu of the standard books such as Beauchamp and Walters. As an independent book, it is inadequate; as a supplement, it is unnecessary. Perhaps in a law course on health law, it may find a use, but even this is doubtful owing to its simplicity. J. G. H. Jones, D. Gareth. Brave New People: Ethical Issues at the Commencement of Life. Rev. ed. Grand Rapids, Mich.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1984. Pp. xxi+ 223. $8.95 (paper). Drawing upon biblical principles, stories, laws, and images, Jones develops general guidelines for analyzing moral issues regarding the generation, alteration, or termination of human life. Jones is chary of two extremes: an uncritical acceptance of technology as an end in itself, and a facile approach to biblical inerrancy that promises quick solutions to complex medical problems. Using data from each extreme, he combines technical sophistication and general biblical wisdom, applied in an ad hoc fashion. The arguments are guided by a Christian affirmation of responsible human creativity within a fallen world in which tragic choices are often necessary. Jones provides conditional allowances to in vitro fertilization, therapeutic abortion, and artificial insemination, but he derides an unqualified celebration of these options for purposes of convenience or social utility. His discussion of cloning and recombinant DNA technology is equally informative and nuanced. Jones is overly defensive toward his evangelical adversaries, and he would strengthen his arguments by attending more systematically to the nature and weight of relevant duties in conflict situations. Nevertheless, his discussion of the promises and perils of new medical technology is informative and sagacious. R. B. M. O'Donovan, Oliver. Begotten or Made? Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1984. Pp. ix+88. $4.95 (paper). In this series of lectures, originally delivered under the auspices of the London Institute for Contemporary Christianity, O'Donovan addresses several problems of sexuality and procreation. His argument moves on two tracks. On a general</page><page sequence="32">Book Notes 919 level, he apprizes the cultural assumptions according to which quandaries are defined, assumptions which place a premium on "technique" in medical practice and family planning. He also addresses the specific problems of in vitro fertilization, artificial insemination, embryo research, and transsexual operations, all of which fall under general moral disapproval. Whether he is addressing the general moral landscape or resolving specific moral problems, O'Donovan employs an inchoate moral theory that turns on an understanding of the natural teloi of human activity. In vitro fertilization, for example, is criticized because it severs the relational and procreative aspects of sexual intercourse, aspects to which conjugal activity is naturally ordained. But O'Donovan never adequately defends his notion of the natural. Thus, it is not clear why certain acts of human willfulness are "artificial" unless one embraces a Cartesian dualism to supplement a theory of natural law. O'Donovan's version of "the natural" is vitiated by now familiar criticisms of "physicalism"-an un- fortunate and untenable reductionism. R. B. M. Harris, Chandice C., and Snowden, Fraser. Bioethical Frontiers in Perinatal Intensive Care. Natchitoches, La.: Northwestern State University Press, 1985. Pp. ix+ 131. $10.00 (paper). The essays in this volume constitute the proceedings of a conference entitled "Bioethical and Developmental Frontiers in Perinatal Intensive Care," held at Northwestern University College of Nursing on May 10-11, 1984. The participants address the issues raised by the birth of defective infants from the vantage points of their respective disciplines. F. Snowden (philosophy) maps out the ethical issues of Baby Doe-type cases and discusses the way the humanities can contribute to our understanding and resolution of them. R. Francoeur (humanities, biology) discusses the humanization and personalization of the fetus as part of an interwoven history of health care exploration and philosophical inquiry. J. Clausen (anthro- pology, nursing) examines the relevance of culture to bioethical issues that arise during the perinatal period. B. Milstein (law) shows how infants are protected by civil rights statutes, and J. Paris (theology) argues that vitalism in medicine runs counter to Judeo-Christian tradition. The final paper, by I. Thorneycroft (reproductive endocrinology), reviews the latest reproductive technologies and shows that difficult bioethical issues extend back to the moment and means of conception. J. G. H. De Kervasdoue, Jean; Kimberly, John R.; and Rodwin, Victor G. The End of an Illusion: The Future of Health Policy in Western Industrialized Nations. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1984. Pp. 292. $28.50 (cloth). The theme of this collection of essays is the move in government health-care policy from an emphasis in the 1950s and 1960s on increasing access to an</page><page sequence="33">920 Ethics July 1986 emphasis in the 1970s and 1980s on controlling costs. The collection includes a number of general essays, followed by case studies of the situation in France, Britain, the United States, and Quebec. In some sense, the story is one familiar from other policy areas. With the economic downturn of the 1970s, money for government programs became harder to come by, even as technological changes increased the costs of provision. At the same time, there occurred a growing skepticism about the value of in- tervention in the first place, in the form of studies purporting to show that health care had little effect on health. These essays present a good introduction to these issues, though they can hardly be accused of advancing the state of the art. The country studies emphasize commonalities in the response to growing health-care costs and in the different options for the future. (Indeed, the commonalities are so great that it is questionable whether the separate country-studies approach used here is really a good one.) What is, perhaps, missing is more of a sense for differences between health care and some of the other policy areas affected by the cutback economics. Dealing with these issues of human life as they do, health care attitudes are bound to raise special ethical concerns and worries. The authors are, in my view, a bit quick to proclaim unreservedly that "the notion that the welfare state can provide an abundance of health services for all citizens is now, recognized as an illusion," or to dismiss the notion of a right to health care. S. K. Capaldi, Nicholas. Out of Order: Affirmative Action and the Crisis of Doctrinaire Liberalism. New York: Prometheus Books, 1985. Pp. x + 201. In this polemic Capaldi presents the most extreme condemnation of affirmative action yet to appear in print. But affirmative action is only the narrower of Capaldi's targets. The broader is "doctrinaire liberalism," the central claims of which seem to be the following: man is the victim of circumstances greater than himself; an intellectual elite understands these circumstances but the masses do not; this elite should therefore control the state and use it to regulate all existing institutions to liberate the oppressed. In Capaldi's view affirmative action is an inevitable consequence of doctrinaire liberalism because it involves government trying to regulate the university to liberate black people who are held to be oppressed. Capaldi declares both affirmative action and doctrinaire liberalism to be sinister and destructive. Affirmative action, he says, very nearly destroyed the university; state activism, and affirmative action in particular, will lead to fascism. These extraordinary claims are unsubstantiated. Capaldi's attack on affirmative action is cocksure but incompetent. He claims to examine "every specific argument that has ever been offered for affirmative action," and to refute these arguments with "embarrassing ease." In fact he examines and refutes straw men. Neither does he show that an advocate of affirmative action must be an advocate of "doctrinaire liberalism." B. R. B.</page><page sequence="34">Book Notes 921 Shrader-Frechette, K. S. Science Policy, Ethics, and Economic Methodology: Some Problems of Technology Assessment and Environmental-Impact Analysis. Dordrecht: D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1985. Pp. xviii+ 321. $39.95 (cloth). Ignore the title. Ignore the subtitle. The much more modest task of this book- and one that it accomplishes well-is to expose various fallacies underlying risk- benefit and cost-benefit analysis (known here as RCBA) as currently practiced. Some objections turn on arguments from the philosophy of science; some pertain to the practice of technology assessment specifically; some recommendations for reform touch on questions of mathematical economics. But those primarily in- terested in science policy or economic methodology really should look elsewhere. This book collects nine separately written essays. Despite that, it displays impressive thematic unity. The quality of the chapters, however, is uneven. Shrader-Frechette is clearly best at close-quarter counterpunching. Chapters devoted to exposing the particular fallacies of others' arguments are treasure chests. Chapters designed to be more general or constructive fall flat by comparison. It is difficult to believe that the same razor-sharp critic of earlier chapters found any profundity in the thought-which forms the basis for one of the book's two positive recommen- dations-that "technology tribunals" would be superior to "science courts" because they could address "the major social-political-ethicalscientific facets of current controversies .. ., and not just the scientific aspects" (p. 293). Still, "econocrats" and their critics alike will find in the central chapters of this book invaluable lessons. R. E. G. Gibson, Mary, ed. To Breathe Freely: Risk, Consent, and Air. Totowa, N.J.: Rowman &amp; Allanheld, 1985. Pp. xv + 294. $35.00 (cloth). This book follows the tried-and-true formula of the Maryland Center for Philosophy and Public Policy's series. Roughly, a quarter of the book is given over to natural scientists on aspects of air pollution (passive smoking, workplace pollution, acid rain, and ozone pollution), half to philosophers (together with a token lawyer and psychologist) on the ethics of imposing risks and the role of consent in justifying or excusing it, and a final quarter to economists on how to reduce air pollution. Each chapter is an excellent one of its kind. All are accessible to readers from other disciplines, or from none. With a few honorable exceptions-the editor's own chapter conspicuously among them-the essays stand largely in- dependently of each other, with few, if any, cross-references. There is a particularly glaring disjunction between the philosophers, concerned primarily with risk im- position in general and its justification or excusing (through consent) in particular, and the economists, concerned with air pollution in general and its reduction (through, e.g., enforceable standards or marketable permits) in particular. So, much of the work of putting the book together, in an intellectual sense, is left to the reader. But no matter. The chapters on risk by Scheffler, Railton, and Thomson immediately enter the "must" list for philosophers writing on the subject, and students of applied philosophy have yet another excellent set of papers on an important policy issue to work over in classes.

Pp. xi+ 108. $11.95 (paper). It is commonly believed that institutions of higher education and those who inhabit them are somehow immune to "real world" moral travails. A major aim of this book, one of the Prentice-Hall Series in Occupational Ethics, is to expose the illusion of this ivory tower myth. Robinson and Moulton begin with a lucid, succinct discussion of the range of moral conflicts inherent in academic institutions; the nature of ethical theories; and four general ethical principlesin light of which the morality of actions may be judged: the principle of fairness, the principle of maximizing benefits, the principle of universalization, and the principle of treating others as ends in themselves. The remainder of the book, chapters 2-5, offers a comprehensive array of moral difficulties which haunt higher education: the connection between ethical principles and academic values, the relation between the university and the community, the value of knowledge, financing of higher education, and respon- sibilities to students. Problems in the hiring and evaluation of faculty, in research, and in teaching are posed and examined in light of the above ethical principles. In the face of the increasing commercialization and overextension of higher education in America, its moral problems grow more acute; its violation of moral principles more prevalent. Robinson and Moulton's "small book" gives a timely, skillful, and systematic treatment of the issues, and in pondering its relentless questions, we realize that the academy is not quite the civilized place we like to believe.

The dual purpose of Sola's collection of readings is to examine the role of ethical issues in educational administrative decision making and to encourage admin- istrators to include relevant ethical factors in their decisions. Toward this end, the twenty-five selections are arranged in two major categories: the theoretical and the practical aspects of educational decision making. Topics addressed include codes of ethics for educational administrators, development of practical admin- istrative skill (with many references to Herbert Simon's Administrative Behavior), the crisis of administrative legitimacy, values clarification, philosophy and edu- cational administration, and a variety of brief case studies on sexism, race relations, freedom of speech, and the like. A twenty-eight page bibliography is included. The strongest and most valuable pieces, both reprints, are Beauchamp and Chil- dress's explanation of moral dilemmas and concise outline of ethical theories and John Ladd's influential paper, "Morality and the Ideal of Rationality in Formal Organizations." Generally, however, the contents of this volume do little to advance our understanding of the subject. Stephen Bailey's essay, for example, on the moral quandaries confronting him as a mayor, has only a tenuous connection with the theme of the book. Nor would I recommend the book as a text. Too many of the selections are written in forced and tedious prose by persons unfamiliar with</page><page sequence="36">Book Notes 923 fundamental principles of moral philosophy or, one suspects, of administrative science or decision theory. B. G. H. Johnson, Deborah G., Computer Ethics. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1985. Pp. xv+ 110. $11.95 (paper). Johnson, Deborah G., and Snapper, John W., eds., Ethical Issues in the Use of Computers. Belmont, Calif.: Wadsworth Publishing Co., 1985. Pp. ix + 363. What do some introductory books about professional ethics have in common with some new computer software? Both may be excessively user-friendly. Just as one may enter a few plain-English commands and perform astonishing computer analyses, so one may also utter a few magic words (like greatest happiness for the greatest number or Categorical Imperative) and perform stunning feats of moral choice. The problem in both instances, of course, is that deep knowledge consists in understanding the complex logical process which the simple commands invisibly invoke. Without this knowledge, one can neither solve problems outside the range of the package nor figure out what to do when one encounters an unanticipated bug in the system. Written for an audience of computer professionals who have no training in either ethics or law, Deborah Johnson's Computer Ethics encounters this difficulty in discussing the moral dilemmas of the computer programmer. Should the programmer be responsible for programs that go awry? Does the programmer need to worry about privacy? What are the consequences of computers for the distribution of power? Who should own computer programs? Both legal and ethical answers are forwarded to these questions. Johnson's conciseness and clarity make the puzzles seem easy. In a few short pages, she dismisses ethical relativism and introduces consequentialist and deon- tological theories of ethics as equally valid theories which apply under different (unspecified) circumstances. She also presents such complex legal notions as negligence, strict liability, and the division of labor among copyright, trade secret, and patent protection. Making these complex, messy notions seem absolutely straightforward is both the book's major strength and its greatest weakness. The user-friendly approach quickly vanishes, however, when Johnson's slim text is combined with the plump anthology she has coedited with John Snapper. Paralleling the structure of the text and consisting mainly of the articles cited there, the anthology immerses readers in the ethical equivalent of machine language. Here, very little seems congenial to the novice as the authors of these re- published articles take on the topics of professional codes of ethics, legal re- sponsibility, the nature of privacy, the relation between power and computers, and the legal protection of software. More comprehensive introductions and some more judicious editing would have improved the collection. Most pieces are, despite extensive redundancy, reproduced in their entirety, except for the law review articles which are mysteriously missing their integral footnotes. By and large, however, the collection creates the more accurate impression that we are still working with a myriad of incompatible systems and that our answers to moral and legal dilemmas still need extensive debugging.

Coral Gables, Fla.: Institute of Interamerican Studies, 1984. $14.95 (paper). Nolan provides perhaps the most detailed and subtle account to date of "the collective ideology of the leadership of the FSLN as it developed from its roots in the 1950s through the victory over the old regime in July 1979, and the implications this ideology held for post-war Nicaragua." The core of the text describes shifts and breaks in the leading themes, theoretical views, and practical strategies adopted by a group of romantic student radicals (including Carlos Fonseca and Tomas Borge) who came of age in the 1950s. It describes how they assimilated (and were assimilated by) a younger generation of leaders (such as Jaime Wheelock and Humberto Ortega) and evolved a body of theory and practice influenced by the Central American tradition of the "golpe," Marxism-Leninism, the traditions of the nationalist guerrilla leader Sandino, Che, and, finally, the fairly rich mix of ideas and movements that began to emerge in Nicaragua after Vatican II, the 1972 earthquake, and the broadly based alliance that arose at the peak of the 1979 insurrection. The concluding chapter of the book is, however, significantly less subtle. In words that echo Bertrand Russell's analysis of Marx, Nolan argues: "In its most advanced form, an ideology like Sandinismo serves as a surrogate religious faith. The revolution is God, the new society is the promised land, and the Frente is the clergy" (p. 123). Yet this claim is belied by the dramatic shifts recounted in Nolan's own narrative (such as the [Utercerista] commitment to political pluralism and Wheelock's about-face on the question of socialization). An equally serious weakness is Nolan's failure to consider empirical evidence the FSLN can and does offer for its central ideological claims. An empirical case can be made and needs to be evaluated. Overall, the book is in many ways an excellent study of the origins of an important new brand of Marxism, but it is flawed by conclusions inconsistent with its own narrative and by an evaluation that does not attempt to seriously consider the empirical merits of the FSLN ideology. G. C. Kaufman, Gordon D. Theology for a Nuclear Age. Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1985. Pp. xi + 65. $12.95 (cloth); $7.95 (paper). Modern theology endeavors to reconceive its fundamental symbols in light of the "world picture" of modernity, and Kaufman insists that the perils of the nuclear age require radical theological reconstruction. Traditional notions of divine sovereignty and Christian soteriology yield the potentially dangerous notion that human irresponsibility cannot finally frustrate divine purposes. Theological symbols (God, Christ) must be imaginatively reconstructed for Christians to "ap- propriately interpret" the gravity of the nuclear situation, to provide "guidance" or "orientation." God, as the "ultimate point of reference," has functioned tra- ditionally to relativize and humanize Christian loyalties, and these two functions constitute criteria for theological adequacy. Kaufman's constructive suggestions employ an immanentist process theology: God is an ecological reality, a power operating in the forces of nature and history. Devotion to God entails the resolve to continue life on earth. A specifically Christian theological vision must include</page><page sequence="38">Book Notes 925 radical self-denial and a widening of human loyalties to embrace the universal community. Yet Kaufman's method moves in a curious circle: symbols are necessary to render experience intelligible, but symbols are reconstructed according to data that are intelligible apart from theological insights. Kaufman also fails to distinguish between the social function of a symbol and its referent; it is unclear whether the test of a symbol's truthfulness is its humanizing function or its ability to refer cogently to an immanent ecological power.
