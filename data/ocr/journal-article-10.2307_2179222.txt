THE division of the sciences into natural and mental is of comparatively recent date. Wilhelm Dilthey was perhaps the first to emphasize effectively the secular character and in- dependence of the mental sciences. Heinrich Rickert has pro- posed to substitute for the term "mental sciences," whose currency is due chiefly to Dilthey's writings, the more restricted term, "sciences of culture." He has not, however, succeeded in introducing that name. As proposed by Dilthey, the mental sciences, whose meaning, province, and import must be brought clearly into view, as against the undue claims of the natural sciences which deny their' limits, lay the emphasis of the inquiry upon introspection. By this method a closed system of the mental sciences is to be worked out, within which "the knowledge of reality, determinations of value, norms, and formulations of purpose are related." The object is to enable the mental sciences in this form to take up their position as equals, over against the system of the natural sciences. For Dilthey, the foundation of philosophy consists in introspection, for "in philosophy the unitary nature of man, which expresses itself variously in different spheres of life and appears temporally de- termined, rises to a consciousness of the connection of these ex- pressions and thereby to the autonomous self-certainty of exis- tence and action." For the knowledge of reality, the determina- tion of value and the fixation of purpose, introspection is in the last analysis the decisive factor in the organic connection of the inner life. Beyond this organic connection thought cannot go. In his essay entitled "The Study of Individuality," Dilthey 329</page><page sequence="2">330 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. expresses himself in greater detail on the organic connection of the spiritual life. All individual formations and all particular relations are embraced in this organic connection of the spiritual life. It is the single condition of life and knowledge. This organic connection should make intelligible, at least to some extent, the living, dynamic connection between the spiritual life and the world of history. For this purpose, Dilthey proposes to substitute for speculative psychology, on the one hand, and experimental, on the other, his descriptive and analytic psychol- ogy which alone makes possible a comprehensive system of the mental sciences in the sense intended by Dilthey and his school. If, then, the mental sciences rest upon inner experience and the artistic understanding of others, then Dilthey's descriptive and analytic psychology naturally becomes the foundation of the mental sciences. The most important of Dilthey's works is and remains his Introduction to the Mental Sciences, in which he endeavors to es- tablish an epistemology of history, and to provide a deeper foun- dation for the mental sciences than had ever been done before. According to his own admission, his first concern is to establish philosophically the principle of the historical school, and the work of the particular social sciences which is at present com- pletely determined by that school. In this way he aims to reconcile the opposition between this historical school and the abstract theories. A " theory of knowledge of the mental sciences," such as Dilthey has contemplated for a generation, without, however, finding leisure to develop into a compact statement the broadly conceived scheme, is the essence of his scientific endeavors. Here are gathered together all the threads of his deep personality. The holy of holies of the human race, namely, truth, is invisi- ble and therefore difficult of approach. The choicest spirits among all nations and in all times have striven, through potent constructions of thought, to pave the road to this shrine and to make access to truth possible for their disciples. Apart from innumerable impassable side-paths and obviously wrong roads, four great high-ways of thought rise into view, in the building of which whole generations have labored. These four principal</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] HISTORICAL OPTIMISM: WILHELM DILTHEY. 331 roads are: God, Spirit, Nature, and History. In order to ascertain the final and highest truth about the meaning of the world-existence, as of all particular existence, the whole of the Middle Ages sought'to question God, to fathom His being, and to deduce earthly truth from the attributes of God, of which truth- fulness is one of the foremost. At first, men resorted by prefer- ence to supernatural light, revelation, and inspiration; later, reluctantly, to natural light, human reason. From the sixteenth century on the illumination of the natural light of reason has increased to such an extent that it eclipses the supernatural light. Philosophers no longer ask of the theologians but of the mathe- maticians what truth is. The ancient doctrine of "double truth"-which appeared for the first time in the didactic poem of Parmenides as the antithesis of doctrine of 'being' and doctrine of 'appearance,' in Plato as that of idea and phenomenon, and in Aristotle as that of the supralunar and the sub-lunar world- acquires in the Middle Ages the formulation of natural light and revelation; and finally receives, in modern times, the form of the opposition between vgritgs eternelles and vgritgs de faith. Instead of the authority of dogma, there has appeared the autonomy of human reason. But every age, even the most revolutionary, has the tendency to stiffen into a dogma; so that revolutionists have their fanatical dogmatists as much as the reactionaries have. The rebellious triad-Humanism, Renaissance and Reformation -has no doubt, in solid phalanx, helped to open the way for the natural light of human reason as against the supernatural light of revelation, if not intentionally, yet in effect. But it im- mediately announced a new dogma: the infallibility of human reason. The authority of the Church creed is removed only in order that the autonomy of human reason may be proclaimed. And this struggle between authority and autonomy, which effects the transition from the mediaeval age to modern times, has been expressed by no one more clearly than by Wilhelm Dilthey, in a series of articles on the history of philosophy which appeared in my Archiv fur Geschichte der Philosophie.' In the transition from the dogma of the Church to the dogma of reason the following subconscious psychological process takes 1 Dr. Stein is the editor of the Archiv fir Geschichte der Philosophie.</page><page sequence="4">332 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. place. The medieval Church, as the guardian of supernatural light, assigns to human reason hard and fast limits that must not be overstepped. "Your natural light, understanding," it says, "may only move within the two boundaries of the Old and the New Testament. Truth has been found. God has proclaimed it to the Jews in the Old, to the Christians in the New Testament, and to the Mohammedans in the Koran. If you wish to illumine truth with your natural light, nothing stands in your way, seeing that supernatural light can but be benefited when strengthened by the illuminating power of natural light, but only on one con- dition, namely, that you accept God as the only gateway of truth. Either reason follows this path, or no path at all. Every other path is closed to it once for all." But now human reason met with the same fate as Kropotkin in the Peter-Paul fortress. In his autobiography, Kropotkin narrates how, during his incarceration, he gave sole atten- tion "to preserving his physical vigor." For this purpose he paced rapidly back and forth in his cell one thousand and fifty times, which made a day's march of two miles. This exer- cise kept up his physical strength. And now if one carries this procedure from the physical to the mental sphere, and translates bodily exercises into dialectical ones, one gets an approximately correct view of the work of scholastic philos- ophy. Human reason was not allowed to quit the prison- cell of ecclesiastical dogma. But within these four walls it might, in order to exercise its powers, walk to-and-fro a thousand times a day. And this it did. He who finds himself compelled by the course of his studies to work his way through this litera- ture, soon recognizes the gait of these spiritual ruminants-this intellectual treadmill, an endless to-and-fro, a thousand repeti- tions, distinguished only by small shades of personality. But the Nemesis of world-history is always at work making breaches in these prison walls. As Kropotkin preserved his physical powers, so did the Scholastics exercise and strengthen their spiritual powers through daily logical gymnastics. This forced to-and-fro march on beaten paths produced in them a remarkable refinement. Their instrument, the intellect, was sharpened and polished. Their art of disputation, which in subtlety and</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.] HISTORICAL OPTIMISM: WILHELM DILTHEY. 333 acuteness, in fineness and elegance, not only yields nothing to that of the dialectical athletes of ancient times, the Sophists, but frequently even excels them, improved their mental powers to such an extent that in the thirteenth century the Scholastics began, by means of this delicate instrument, daily sharpened anew, to undermine their confining prison walls. The free thinkers at the Sorbonne in Paris, the nominalistic Scholastics in England, the Averroists among the Arabs and in Padua, the followers of Gersonides among the Jews, all employed human reason, refined by Scholastic philosophizing, to bore through the walls of dogma, till they succeeded in peeping, as through a keyhole, at that which lies beyond dogma. Here new horizons opened before thinkers. Ways to truth appeared of which the Scholastics had never dreamt. God is no more the only door to truth, as had been so long assumed. Rather, two new gates are opened, through which the philosophy of modern times seeks to force its way to truth. The one is called Mind, the other Nature. The first we characterise as rationalistic and idealistic, and, since Kant's day, as dogmatic philosophy (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz); the second, as realistic, empirical philosophy (Bacon, Hobbes, Locke, the philosophers of the English Enlightenment, the French Encyclopaedists, Hume). In the former, Nature is derived and deduced from' Mind; in the latter, on the other hand, Mind is distilled out of Nature. There, Nature is logicized, completely deduced from "Reason;" here, on the other hand, is Mind naturalized. There, one proceeds (methodologically considered) deductively; here, inductively. There, one erects a cult of reason; here, a cult of fact. There, one holds absolutely and exclusively to the sovereign human spirit, whose autonomy, reliability, and unconditional as well as limitless capacity are maintained with the rigidity of a dogma; here, one is content with attending to facts, observing and group- ing methodically, grasping and classifying reality in its connec- tions, in short, reducing all truth to objective reality. For the idealist, that is true which can be proved mathematically; for the naturalist, that which can be observed and described as an actual phenomenon of nature. The new creed of the idealist is therefore Mind (ratio), and the new evangel is mathematics.</page><page sequence="6">334 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. The new creed of the realist, on the other hand, is Fact (res), reality, and its new gospel is-since the days of Leonardo da Vinci, Kepler, Galileo, and Newton-physics. These two gateways of truth, mathematics and physics, proved to the scientists of modern times to be wide enough for a part of truth, but too narrow for the whole of truth. If, for instance, to know, as Comte says, is savoir pour privoir, then we can no doubt discover from mathematics and physics what is and what must be; but we can never discover what should be. The descriptive natural sciences catalogue and make an inventory of the three realms of Nature, according to class, type, species, and genus, as they actually are and present themselves to our senses. The inductive natural sciences, on the other hand, construct the eternal relations among the forces of Nature, and organize, according to the mathematical method, the existence of things, "so far as it is determined by universal laws." The former thus determine what is actual in Nature; the latter group and classify the constant relations of natural forces to one another, and find the formulas for what is necessary, i.e., what is necessary for thought. What man should do, however, he can learn neither from mathematics nor from physics. Thus, Mind and Nature give only partial truths; they throw light upon what is and must, but not upon what should be. We humans are, however, primarily acting, and only secondarily thinking, beings. It is of incomparably greater importance and value to us to know what to do or to avoid than to gain an insight into the connection of natural processes. Kant calls this the primacy of practical over theoretical reason. Whether the universe is composed of atoms or energies is a question which affects our instinct for knowledge very much; but our individual life is not at all affected by it. We could regulate our relation to the universe equally well according to the one conception or the other. It is otherwise with questions of 'should.' With the answer to these questions stands or falls our personality. Man requires at every moment of his conscious existence standards of behavior, sign-posts, norms, by which to regulate in every particular case his actions and his relations. These norms the medieval Church fixed for its devotees, and they preserve their</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.] HISTORICAL OPTIMISM: WILHELM DILTHEY. 335 validity wherever the deep-rooted respect for a supernatural origin of these norms has maintained itself undiminished. In our culture-system, however, there are large sections of the population who fundamentally reject any super-rational source for the fixing of standards of human behavior. Not a few of our generation refuse to consult inspired legislators, who lived thousands of years ago and carried on their beneficent work in other climes and times, under essentially different historical and cultural conditions. Yet even these advanced persons require some criteria of action, else they fall into licentiousness and anarchic caprice. If, however, neither theology nor mathematics and physics afford them directions for their actions, they are compelled to look about for a new gateway to truth, and this fourth and last gateway is History. Nature, as we have emphasized before, is the kingdom of laws, History, the kingdom of ends and values. Since all should is equivalent to is in the future, to the realization of a willed con- dition and a purposed end, human ends cannot be obtained and derived from nature, but from history. I should do that which, in the first place, will further my self-preservation, and, over and above this, the preservation of the species. What has elevated my species-in this case the human race-civilized, tempered, ennobled, advanced it, I can never learn from mathematics or physics, but from history in its widest sense, in the sense, namely, of the universal history of human culture. This is the great laboratory of the student of mind. If we survey that group of actions of preceding generations which have benefitted the life of the race, served to maintain and elevate it, and if we exclude those which have proved pernicious, reactionary, and destructive, we obtain by the aid of these reflexions criteria of our own con- duct. We should do whatever has been proved by history to preserve the species, to further the interests of the race, to elevate the human type. On the other hand, we should refrain from whatever history has proved corrupt and injurious, disintegrative and destructive, retarding or hindering the welfare of the race. Droysen has expressed this thought in the following words: "History is the self-knowledge of mankind, its self-certainty. It is not light and truth; but is the seeking after them, a sermon</page><page sequence="8">336 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VoL. XXXIII. about them, an inspiration to them." Universal history as the highest teacher of mankind, this is the summit of the hopes and dreams of the historical school as well as of the "mental history movement" of our time. Wilhelm Dilthey has been called "the philosopher of the his- torical school." We believe we have presented in the above ac- count the meaning and justification of that which has, ever since the days of Winkelmann and Herder, Savigny and Niebuhr, Jakob Grimm and B6ckh, Burke, Guizot, and Tocqueville, gone by the collective name "historical school." Our analysis of the psychological process, in which we try to reveal the inner neces- sity that has led to the origin of the historical school, does not claim to have indicated with chronological accuracy the only effective causes of the origin of the school. We are rather fully conscious of offering here only a psychology of the historical school as we picture it to ourselves and as we wish to reproduce it in the reader's mind, in order to evaluate truly the position of Dilthey as a philosopher of the historical school and a leader of the mental history movement of the present day. We propose to describe here in brief outline the philosophical attitude of Dilthey towards the historical school. When the gate of history to the knowledge of truth was opened, the first restless spirits seized upon the new discovery in impetuous haste. Bodin, Bossuet, Montesquieu, Turgot, Condorcet, and especially the Italian Vico in his Scienza nuovo (1725), worked without limit the mine of the philosophy of history. Their fancy grew wings with which they flew into the ethereal region of the most daring dreams of the metaphysics of history. In their youthful joy of discovery, they thought they had found the laws of history, and by way of these laws come into possession of the key to the world-riddle. It was the dream of a God in history-one of those premature metaphysical generalizations in which the history of literature, that cemetery of human ideas, is so uncan- nily rich. God was sought at first in the Church, then in the human spirit, then in nature, and lastly in history. And thus there arose in the philosophy of history a new kind of metaphys- ics, which Dilthey, who makes a vigorous assault upon all metaphysics, seeks remorselessly to drive out from every nook and corner.</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.] HISTORICAL OPTIMISM: WILHELM DILTHEY. 337 But likewise did the naturalistic sociology of Comte, Mill and Spencer find in Dilthey its keenest and most outspoken critic. These positivists confound, as Herder did before them, nature and history, the kingdom of laws and the world of ends and values. Out of protoplasm and cellular nucleus they tried to deduce what man ought to be. According to them, man is, even in his behavior, only a segment of the whole of Nature and is therefore subject to the general world-laws and not to special laws of ends. This naturalism finds its crudest expression, in sociology, in that organic conception of sociology once dominant, as founded by Spencer and sanctioned by Schaeffle. In the eyes of Dilthey, sociology is no less metaphysics than is the philosophy of history; only, it is there a question of natural- istic and here of idealistic metaphysics. Dilthey has casually let fall these much discussed words: "This superstition, which subjects the works of the historians to a secret process in order alchemistically to transform the concrete substance found in them into the pure gold of abstraction and to compel History to yield up its most precious secret, is just as grotesque as ever was the dream of an alchemist nature philosopher who hoped to extract from Nature her magic word." To this metaphysics Dilthey opposes a psychology and epistemology of history. The epistemologist is in his eyes the legitimate successor of the sceptic. Dilthey represents the stand- point of introspection based on an epistemological illumination of history. And just as every thinker proceeds at first critically and negatively from his own standpoint, in order to build the sub-structure for his own contribution, and then to justify posi- tively its existence as a logical necessity, so does Dilthey destroy with a sure hand all metaphysics, in order to provide room for his psychology and epistemology. The analysis of the facts of consciousness is the highest principle of his doctrine. Inner experience supplies for him the firm foundation of his thought. All experience is determined by the conditions of our conscious- ness. From this centre, by means of the special sciences, rays must be sent to the periphery of the universe. The right of the mental sciences to existence must, therefore, be maintained, and their province must be determined over against that of the</page><page sequence="10">338 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. natural sciences, as has since been in large measure accomplished by Windelband and Rickert from the standpoint of the philosophy of norms. The historical school to which Dilthey belongs requires a psychological grounding and epistemological founda- tion, which Dilthey had intended to supply in his Introduction to the Mental Sciences. The positivists, Comte and Mill, he points out, distorted historical reality through arbitrary adoption of the methods of natural science. Not through the door of Nature, but through that of History does one enter the realm of the mental sciences. Only historical introspection prepares for a full comprehension of philosophical introspection (epistemology). The French and English positivists (Comte, Mill, and.Spencer), against whom Wilhelm Dilthey was the first among the Germans to enter the lists with the whole weight of a training in universal history, have, according to him, erected only an emergency structure which is no more tenable than the bold speculations of a Schelling or Oken about Nature. Nature, however, is dumb. Only " the power of our imagination throws upon it a gleam of inwardness and life." It is also for us only external, not internal like society, which we experience in ourselves. "The waterfall is composed of homogeneous, colliding particles of water; but a single sentence, which is after all only a breath from the mouth, convulses the whole living society of a continent through a play of motives in a multitude of individual units." It is, consequently, a great mistake to try to construct the mental sciences after the pattern of the natural sciences. On the contrary, the temptation would seem to be much more direct for the naturalist to explain the essence of nature on the analogy of social facts, which are more familiar because created by us. For socio-historical reality forms the point of departure for all knowledge. The knowledge of the totality of this reality, Dilthey calls the most general and final problem of the mental sciences. The principal objection which Dilthey raises against the Hegelian philosophy of history and sociology of the type of Comte and Spencer is to the effect that metaphysics lurks in all of them. They, therefore, do not represent real sciences at all; their problems are insoluble and their methods false; they misconceive, moreover, the relation of the historical sciences to</page><page sequence="11">No. 4.] HISTORICAL OPTIMISM: WILHELM DILTHEY. 339 the other special sciences. Hegel's 'world-spirit' and even Schleiermacher's 'reason' are abstract ideas, which spread their gray net over the historical world. It is worse still with the naturalistic metaphysics of history of Comte and of his interpreter Mill. Dilthey recognises Comte's law of the three stages (fetishism, metaphysics, and positivism) as a real discovery, although in this Turgot anticipated Comte. He is also sympa- thetic with the relation of dependence of the historical succession of events upon their logical order, as disclosed by Comte. Kant had thought along similar lines before him. But he cannot accept the confused and indeterminate general ideas which Comte applied to the historical process, the "stony generaliza- tions " of Comte. These outlines he compares to " brick buildings which imitate, by means of whitewash, the blocks, columns, and ornamentation in granite which can only be produced as the result of long and patient labor upon a brittle substance." It is all "metaphysical fog," which is nowhere denser than in Comte, who transformed the Catholicism of De Maistre into the silhou- ette of a hierarchical government of society by science. Here we cannot refrain from interpolating two observations. We do not like to see the Caesaro-popism of Comte, which belonged to the last period of his creative activity-a period which was at least dimmed by the preceding spiritual darkness- exploited as an argument against the author of the Course of Positive Philosophy. The position of Dilthey as against Comte, whose philosophy had neither a psychology nor an epistemology for its base, is so strong that it can very well renounce such an easy triumph. Further, it is a fair demand of the sense of justice not to treat Mill, after his break with Comte, as a mere train- bearer of the French positivist. The recent publications of Lkvy-Brtihl, moreover, throw ample light on this point. Of course, we have no intention here of weakening the arguments of Dilthey against sociology; for we are here concerned only to exhibit Dilthey's philosophy in its essential features. We believe we have revealed the negative-critical part; mental science must be freed from vassalage to the methods of the natural sciences. At the same time, however, the logical connections which relate the separate sciences within it to one another must be revealed,</page><page sequence="12">340 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. for the "isolated philosophy of the spirit is a ghost; the separa- tion of the philosophical view of historico-social reality from positive reality is a pernicious inheritance from metaphysics." As Kant has opposed a 'critique of pure reason' and Avernarius a 'critique of pure experience' to all previous dogmatism, so Dilthey begins his epistemological foundation of the mental sciences with a critique of historical reason, i.e., of the faculty of man to know himself and society and the history created by him. Formal, logic, methodology, and epistemology are subjected, for this purpose, to a strict examination in the light of their his- torically effective forms. Against empiricism, on the one hand, and speculative idealism, on the other, the standpoint of intro- spection, of inner experience, is firmly held, historically developed, and demonstrated as the decisive counter-argument to all metaphysics. It is true, every metaphysical system is necessary in its place and time, i.e., logically justified; but viewed under the glass of introspection all metaphysics appears as an historically limited phenomenon. Metaphysics cannot explain the world- connection without falling into inconsistencies. It inevitably becomes involved in antinomies. Its instruments of thought, substance and causality, are neither transparent nor capable of unambiguous definition. Therefore, exactly as in the case of Hegel and Comte, it is inferior to religion. But religious life is not for Dilthey, as it was for them, a passing phase in the evolution of mankind; for though it represents its experiences, by psychological necessity, in the symbolic language of myth and dogma, it is the "permanent basis of intellectual evolution." In this view, Dilthey is akin to Feuerbach. The self-disintegration of metaphysics, to which is devoted the historical portion of the Introduction, with its fine perception of details and its large view of the whole, leads to this, that all meta- physics "is struck dumb." Materialism, pantheism, monism, and idealism are promptly "stunned" by the irrefutable sceptics. Concepts like force, atom, molecule are for most scientists only a system of auxiliary constructions, with the help of which to explain the conditions of the given state of things in a connection which is clear for thought and useable for life. If Dilthey had not written this sentence a quarter of a century ago, we would not</page><page sequence="13">No. 4.] HISTORICAL OPTIMISM: WILHELM DILTHEY. 341 be surprised to hear our modern nature-philosophers, Ostwald, Mach, or Stallo, speak in praise of it as the newest view. That object and cause, substance and causality are but 'ideas grounded in experience,' is a conception which our modern energists can find in Dilthey. Anything else, he thinks, lacks legitimacy of origin. The same is true of atom, force, or law. Natural science confines itself to partial contents of the external reality and does not attain to a unitary connection of all the conditions of existence. Whereas the philosophers of the past spoke of substantial forms or matter, the physicists of today set up natural laws and mass- particles, and the Darwinians speak of forms, species, and genera of nature-metaphysics pure and simple. These are only other expressions for the repressed inner purposiveness. But if one remembers the historic fate of the most revered of all metaphysi- cal concepts, i.e., substance and causality, Dilthey, in agreement with Kant, assures us, as the last word of his Introduction: " Metaphysics as science is impossible." Every metaphysician only reproduces his ego, as Aristotle already asserted against Plato's doctrine of ideas. He exhibits at bottom only a gigantic reflection of his own self. "The metaphysical spirit beholds itself in fantastic magnification, in a second face, so to speak." Consequently, the epistemologist who investigates this self becomes the legitimate successor of the sceptic. Epistemology is thus, as it were, the euthanasia of metaphysics. In a story of great beauty adapted from Novalis, Dilthey arrives at this conclusion: If the soul seems to succeed in behold- ing the subject of the natural process itself, stripped of its veil, it finds in this its own self. If only Feuerbach had lived to see the appearance of the Introduction! Here anthropomorphism, as the prime source of all our forms of thoughts and values, is exposed at a still deeper level than is done by Feuerbach. Cham- berlain and Keyserling at their profoundest touch Dilthey. Not only myth and religion, but even metaphysics is nothing but an idealization and generalization of human race-properties which we substantialize, objectify, and set up as our 'second self.' Here, however, the thread breaks off. The positive develop- ment of epistemology is lacking. We get a faint and distant glimpse only of that philosophical</page><page sequence="14">342 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXXIII. new land which Dilthey has set out to discover, but has not quite conquered for us. If I interpret correctly the features visible to us, I find them in the sentence: "Thought can find no other connection in reality than a logical one." If it be given to Dilthey to carry his monumental work to a completion, he may succeed no better than Kant, who, having destroyed metaphysics as a science, subsequently gave shelter to it again in the form of the 'metaphysical need.' But our sensitive, delicately strung poet-philosopher, who more than anyone else responds to lyrical waves of thought, will replace the hard 'metaphysical need' of Kant by the softer 'indissoluble metaphysical temper.' My historical authority for this assumption is no other than Wilhelm Dilthey himself. After metaphysics has become permanently mute to him, there still appears a trace of something like longing in the following sentence, which we quote at the same time as a sample of the style of the great linguistic artist: "But from the stars there rings out, even to us, when the stillness of the night approaches, that harmony of the spheres, of which the Pytha- goreans said that only the noise of the world could drown it, an indissoluble metaphysical temper which is at the base of all arguments and will survive them all." The richest philosophical product of our time is that collective work which we owe to the combined labors of the professional philosophers, Die Kultur der Gegenwart (The Culture of the Present Day). In the volume entitled Systematische Philosophie, the leading German systematic philosophers have expressed them- selves synoptically on their respective specialities. Thus, Wilhelm Dilthey has dealt with "The Essence of Philosophy;" Alois Riehl with " Logic and the Theory of Knowledge; " Wilhelm Wundt with " Metaphysics; " Hermann Ebbinghaus with " Psychology; " Rudolf Eucken with "The Philosophy of History;" Friedrich Paulsen with "Ethics," and Theodor Lipps with "Aesthetics." Wilhelm Dilthey's introductory chapter on "The Essence of Philosophy" gives the collection its character. Philosophy is for him the doctrine of thee world-view. By philosophy or doctrine of the world-view is to be understood, first of all, with Plato and Kant, the reflection of the spirit upon all its modes of</page><page sequence="15">No. 4.] HISTORICAL OPTIMISM: WILHELM DILTHEY. 343 behavior. Whereas the sciences of experience seek to reveal portions or phases of reality, philosophy since Comte aims to comprehend the whole of reality and thereby to build up, through the logical connection of all the sciences, a system of perfectly unified knowledge. This logical connection, which Comte as- sumed but did not prove, especially since, in his system of positive philosophy, a psychology is no less wanting than a distinctive logic, is to be established only through inner experience. For this reason, philosophy has been called by Beneke and Lipps 'the science of inner experience or mental science.' But even this definition does not satisfy Dilthey. The object of the mental sciences consists, according to Dilthey, in the reality of the experiences themselves given in inner perception. In his beautiful book, Erlebnis und Dichtung (Experience and Poetry), Dilthey has pursued this trend of thought from the side of poetry (Lessing, Goethe, H6lderlin, Novalis). Here, however, Dilthey deals merely with the definition of philosophy itself, which, in contradistinction to the separate sciences, has for its problem the solution of the riddle of the world and of life. In the historical solution of this problem, it shows itself as a permanent function in the system of ends in society and, indeed, as that function which reveals a "uniform situation in society." These systems of ends Dilthey designates by an expression which has been naturalized in the language, namely, 'systems of culture.' As art and religion, so also does philosophy belong to the structure of society. "For in the co-existence of persons and succession of generations, general ideas, standing in relation to the riddle of the world and of life, are joined in a system of ends." He who analyzes philosophy, therefore, must, according to Dilthey, find the types of world-views and recognize order in their formation. The types of religious philosophy are gradually translated into conceptual thinking and thereby affect the philosophical world- views. With art in general and poetry in particular, philosophy shares a greater mobility and freedom. Its object is the world. To grasp the value, meaning, and significance of this world, and that in the form of conceptual thought-this task it has ack- nowledged from the beginning of historically authenticated thought. And however much Dilthey may reject metaphysics 23</page><page sequence="16">344 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. as a science, he cannot deny the claim of philosophy as a priveleged member among the culture-systems, nay, he must actually declare that conceptual thought proceeds to the highest generalizations, rises to an architectonic whole culminating in a single peak, and even contains within itself the "reference to an all-comprehending connection and the establishment of a final principle." If we, however, once admit a single world-principle, a world-reason especially, a world-end or a world-cause, then we cannot for long escape the eternally tempting siren song of the 'metaphysical need.' This 'metaphysical need' must be taken account of also by social optimism. The only qualification is that I recognize it independently of any metaphysical hypothesis. I have here sketched an outline of the meaning of history regarded indepen- dently of any metaphysical standpoint, except the assumption that history is proceeding on an upward course. LUDWIG STEIN.
