The importance of these Pre columbian cultures in the general scheme of Mesoamerican archaeology has been the object of much speculation, but as yet, few facts have been unearthed to give more than a hint of their substance, character and way of life. The following article is a brief, general account of the first phases of our recent explora tion along the Costa Chica in the remote southern region of the State of Guerrero. A complete report of this archaeological sur vey will be published by The Brooklyn Museum after the final season of fieldwork in 1963. The study, sponsored by the Museum and made possible by a grant from The Ford Foundation in its Program in the Creative Arts, was undertaken by the author and Dr. Alan P. Olson, Curator of the Museum of Northern Arizona, with the assistance of Louisa Rowell Stark, Sra. C. de Miranda and Andres Bustos Fuentes. Since the Spanish Conquest, many of the rebellious and turbulent events in Mexico's history have taken place in the mountainous state bordering the Pacific known as Guerrero. Its name — the Spanish equivalent of warrior — suggests as much the rugged character of this land as the temperament of its inhabitants. It first brings to mind some of the nation's soldiers; the shipwrecked Gonzolo Guerrero, for one, incited the Maya against Cordoba at the time of the Conquest;1 centuries later, the revolutionary Juan Guerrero led the ill-fated "peasant rebellion" against the rule of Spain.2 But the state officially honors Vincente Guerrero, who fought for independence along with Hidalgo and Morelos in the bloody decades of the early nineteenth century. Their plans for a Mexican Republic were conceived within the territories now com prised in the state, and its mountains gave refuge to Guerrero's insurgent regiments which, even after the execution of his two compatriots, kept alive the ideals of the Revolution. As in the days of this dedicated soldier, the wild, isolated countryside still nurtures the idealistic and independent character of the people of Guerrero, and arms them as well with an avid distrust of strangers. The ranges of the Sierra Madre del Sur are formidable barriers against the outside world, and settlements are not infrequently cut off from one 7</page><page sequence="3">another by many wide, unpredictable rivers which descend from the highlands to the sea. One modern highway connecting the Mexican capital with the sophisticated port of Acapulco bisects the state; so far it has had little effect on the surrounding regions, and the hardy, tradi tional way of life in the scattered villages of Guerrero continues without any interruption. Travellers do not often venture beyond the route to Acapulco. There are few roads and a journey by horse or on foot through this unfamiliar country is exceedingly arduous — but it could also be an adventure worth its risks and discomfort. This aspect of Guerrero is apparent in a curious tale told by archaeologists who, some years ago, explored the length of the Rio Balsas in the northern part of the state. In a small village midway on their journey, they sought a place to stay the night and were directed to the house of one Dona Julia. Although it was the only shelter available for miles around, there was plenty of room; a few days before, prim Dona Julia shot the previous boarder for casting aspersions on her character and shot her husband, too, for believing him. This is one of a number of extraordinary legends of Mexico's "wild west" which also help to explain Guerrero's continued isolation. During the past two centuries Guerrero's citizens have exerted their influence in national politics, but the role of its ancient cultures in Mesoamerican prehistory is not yet clear. Archaeological exploration has been limited mainly to the highlands adjacent to the states of Michoacan, Morelos, Oaxaca and Mexico, and in the regions of the Rio Balsas and the northern coast. The southern half of the state, es pecially along the Pacific coast or Costa Chica, is relatively unknown. Despite theories purporting the area's importance in the Preclassic or Formative period of Mexican culture or its possible significance as a point of contact with Andean civilizations,3 no facts have as yet been provided by actual archaeological excavations. Spanish documents4 evidence that southern Guerrero was a thriving center of late Precolumbian culture though the sixteenth century reports by friars, landowners and corregidores on conditions in New Spain, concede the rapid extinction of the Indian. Like hundreds of other settlements in the southern provinces, the town of Ometepec with an already depleted population of 10,000 in A.D. 1540 was decimated to a mere 400 people only thirty years later. Azoyu, reduced from 10,000 to 1000 in the same decades, fared better, but of the 20,000 inhabitants of Xochislahuaca, once a major religious center, only 500 survived the epidemics, hunger and exploitation of the encomenderos.0 Death took its greatest toll among the Indians of the coast, causing such a desperate labor shortage that Spanish landlords were forced to import African slaves to work their estates. Although the nature of the evidence is negative, these records do attest to the final destruction of a once populous, pros perous and civilized land. 8</page><page sequence="4">Beyond this, little else was known about the southern coastal region of the state; it could only be inferred that cultural sequence followed that of other Middle American civilizations whose development is well understood. Southern Guerrero adjoins the land of the Mixtecs who were prominent in the final centuries before the Conquest, and was by no means remote from Monte Alban, the center of culture in Oaxaca during both Preclassic and Classic eras. Possibly, a long established connection with these regions existed in the past and perhaps in some way, southern Guerrero played a significant role in the Precolumbian history of Meso america; these factors determined its choice for an exploratory archaeo logical survey. A research grant awarded by The Ford Foundation provided the opportunity to explore the Costa Chica; under the sponsorship of The Brooklyn Museum, the first stages of field work were carried out in the winter of 1959—60 and again during the following fall. The purpose of the survey was to locate and map all archaeological sites within the region in order to determine, as far as possible without extensive excava tion, the nature and particular characteristics of its architecture and art and the cultural identity of its ancient inhabitants. The initial phase of the survey, centered in the Ometepec and Igualapa districts, was an important and necessary introduction to the Costa Chica; it permitted a return trip less than a year later for extensive, almost unrestricted exploration within the block of territory indicated on the map below.

Beyond a few market towns, scattered hamlets, isolated ranches and copra plantations, the forest is dense, almost impenetrable and obscures the traces of ancient settlements. Locating sites seemed impossible at first, since this wilderness of mountains and river canyons precluded a systematic, mile-by-mile search of the terrain and there were no previous archaeological studies to provide some point of departure. Yet again Colonial documents were informative for they noted several of the region's major civic and religious centers at the time of the Con quest and a number of these place-names still correspond to present day settlements. Beginning the search along the foothills of the Sierras in the interior margin of the Costa Chica, we explored several important sites within the vicinity of San Luis de Acatlan, Azoyu, Igualapa and Ometepec and discovered numerous other ruins as we made our way down to the coast. Aided by local informants who often pointed out promising areas, we found that locating sites was, in reality, far less of a problem than actually reaching them. Not only were the horses which we hoped would carry us over most of this rough terrain difficult to secure, but it was soon apparent that here all means of transport are, at best, fortui tous. From time to time we were offered the luxury of a lift by Jeep, small plane, even dugout canoe, though many miles were crossed on foot, in the manner of both ancient and modern inhabitants of Guerrero. A Jeep was part of the equipment for the second trip. Yet as we set out from Acapulco, unseasonable, torrential rains began to flood all of southern Mexico. Warned that even the road beyond town was under water, time did not permit delay, and we began on the first leg of a slow and muddy journey south. Fortunately the Jeep floundered just before the Rio Papagallo, a bridge-less, quarter-mile expanse of tumultous river which could have carried it out to sea. The problem of travel in southern Guerrero is compounded by another, more serious element. While our welcome along the way was warm and hospitable, almost making a myth of the Costa Chica's popular notoriety, we soon learned that for strangers some caution is, indeed, necessary. The importance of the region as a center for pilgrimages and religious shrines dates back to Precolumbian times and many ancient customs, albeit modified to conform to Christian practice, still remain in force. Since the time of the Conquest, disruption of these traditions has been associated with the presence of strangers. Our situation was in no way improved by an obvious North American nationality. The activities of a fellow countryman, an Evangelical missionary doctor, were causing severe tensions throughout southern Guerrero; although he built the only hospital between Oaxaca and Acapulco and tended 10</page><page sequence="6">remote patients by plane, he was opposed by the Catholic Church, es pecially in those districts traditionally important as shrines. The clergy, energetically combating his growing influence among the poorer settlements, succeeded in spreading the belief that all Americans are evangelistas. For this reason, we were watched with suspicion in Igualapa and were advised to limit our stay in this village to which many thousands of pilgrims still come each year. We did so only after an intensive and futile search for the ancient site which logically should exist in the vicinity. The grounds of the cathedral, set on the mountain slope above the village and overlooking the valley below, promised the best results. But, under the vigilant guard of the padre, the whole area was in accessible and only ceramic deposits found nearby indicated the possi bility of an earlier occupation. As the present sacerdotal character of these, villages is actually the continuation of an ancient, non-Christian tradition, it was not surprising to discover that certain archaeological ruins, although remote and un inhabited, are still regarded as sacred among the more primitive peoples of the coast. The extensive architectural complex known as Capulin Chocolate was an impressive example; on the summit of the site's largest pyramid-mound, a fireplace had been built next to a group of nine stone stelae. The fireplace was of recent vintage and we were finally able to ascertain that certain Christian holidays are celebrated here each spring with strangely unorthodox rites and animal sacrifice in order to invoke the summer rains. If the peoples of southern Guerrero still cling to the heritage of the past, it would seem that these traditions were formed by a Precolumbian civilization of exceeding vitality. Proof of this exists in the numerous traces of antiquity found throughout the area; ruins of once magnificent pyramids surrounded by complexes of buildings, courts, vast plazas and causeways lie covered by centuries of forest growth or beneath villages and their entangling milpas. Despite concealment, the most immediately striking feature was the location which had been chosen for these religious or civic centers; even in the relatively flat coastal area, each was situated on the hill, mountain-side or cliff-edge which commanded the broadest, most distant view possible. More accessible or archi tecturally feasible ground, even higher or more defensible peaks could have been selected within the immediate vicinity, but invariably no other spot provided so vast a panorama and optical illusion of height and space. The builders' motivation for site placement would have important social or religious implications but so far we can only speculate. Perhaps it was for protection since the Mixtecs in neighboring regions are known to have fortified mountain peaks with walls and moats to which they retreated in time of attack. Yet we found little indication, however, that this was significant in the formation of an architectural style along the 11</page><page sequence="7">Costa Chica. The majority of sites, built up gently sloping areas, were easily vulnerable to attack on one or more sides and no signs of defensive installations were apparent. The builders may have also considered some form of communication since the highest mound construction at each site frequently provided an observation point from which one or more of the other centers in the neighboring region could be seen. In all likelihood, religious and ritual factors dominated the choice of building ground. The ancient Mesoamerican proclivity to elevate temple structures on high pyramid bases reached its ultimate point in Oaxaca where an entire mountain peak was leveled to make way for the ritual structures of Monte Alban. Among the Mixtecs, the gods were also thought to dwell in high places and it is not unlikely that similar ideas prevailed in southern Guerrero. Each archaeological site will be described in detail in another publi cation, but seen as a group, certain significant characteristics stand out as indicative of the particular architectural style of this region. The ancient builders cleverly made use of the formation of the terrain to give awesome height to the dominant pyramid-mounds, sometimes posing the final group of these constructions at the precipitious rim of a canyon or cliff. The ruins at Comaltepec follow the contours of a high saddle-shaped hill above the Rio Caterina and, even more spectacularly, the Piedras Labradas site was built up to the sheer cliffs of a mountain overlooking this same river. The predominate structures at Tesanto and Capulin Chocolate stand at the edge of vast canyons while the site of Cerro de la Yerba Santa, as its name implies, is found on the uppermost slopes. No general rule seemed to govern architectural orientation, perhaps because conformation to the natural advantages of the terrain was more important to the builders than directional preference. Below the major pyramids of each ruin were descending series of adjoining courts and broad plazas, their perimeters marked by low mounds supporting other smaller structures or, as was true of certain highland sites as Piedras Labradas, depressions which might have been ceremonial ball courts. In most instances, these constructions and in numerable other mounds placed at random had once been faced with stone. There were indications that stone stairways led to the top of some of the smaller constructions, while paved causeways as at Capulin (Fig. 2) or wide earth ramps as at Piedras Labradas and San Isidro connected the largest pyramid mounds. Dwelling areas beyond these ceremonial precincts were more difficult to locate. Only rare evidence of stone walls with no visible pattern of construction and ceramic deposits in earth cuts or along stream banks some distance below the mound complexes would suggest living quarters. At many sites such as Tesanto, Piedras Labradas, Capulin, Cruz Corazon and Yerba Santa presumably agricultural terracing was extensive, often extending down the mountainside to the river valley below. 12</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 2 Paved causeway at the Capulin Chocolate site.</page><page sequence="9">Our scheme of architectural characteristics can only be tentative without confirming surface appearances by actual excavation. On the other hand, the style of pottery fragments and diverse objects as figurines, stamps, spindle whorls, whistles, ear ornaments, pendants and large stone sculpture found on the sites gives a more accurate idea of the identity of these ancient builders. Ceramic evidence, although necessarily incomplete and tentative, seems to indicate a substantial difference in cultural sequence between the coastal plain and the interior mountainous region of the Costa Chica. A larger proportion of coastal pottery and ceramic figurines belonged stylistically to the Preclassic or Formative cultures of the first millennium B.C. Among the sherds collected at Marquelia, Comaltepec and San Isidro were simple black vessels deco rated with incised geometric designs, some filled with red pigments, and polished brown and white slipped wares. Different types of solid and hollow handmade figurines were found in abundance, especially beautifully modeled female heads with punched eyes and elaborate headdress, varieties of the Olmec "baby face" with characteristically deformed cranium and mouth labret, figurines with grotesque appliqué features, some with bearded faces and others in elaborate costume but with curiously eyeless heads ( Fig. 1 ). These early types were supple mented by a small range of clay sculptures rendered according to the Classic period styles of Monte Alban and Teotihuacan in central Mexico, dominant in the early part of the first millennium A.D. In contrast, little Preclassic pottery or figurines were collected in those ruins located in the mountainous San Luis — Ometepec zone, although of course, such material might be encountered in actual exca vation. Instead, strong influences beginning in early Classic times seem to have come from the Oaxaca region and possibly Teotihuacan. Pottery consisted largely of buff, orange, polished red or red and orange wares, bridge-spout vessels, tripod bowls, effigy pot covers and some pottery with anthropomorphic appliqué features (Fig. 3). Vast deposits of plain red ware, miniature bowls and many other forms, were found on one section of a mound at Cruz Corazon, but this red ware is ubiquitous in the Costa Chica and is apparently so along Guerrero's northern coast. Mold-made figurines with features of the feline, bat and old man deities, others with characteristic mouth and dental mutilation suggested again Oaxaca, while a number resembled the Mixtec god, Xipe. Toward the end of the first millennium A.D., the differences which separated the mountain and coastal cultures of the Costa Chica began to fade while population seems to have increased. Ceramics and figurines of the late Classic and Postclassic era styles appear with the same fre quency and in great quantities in both regions; serpent and effigy-form vessel supports were common but no examples of the famous late Mixtec polychrome were turned up even after intensive search. Several flat, stylized Mazappan-type figurines, common in Nayarit, Jalisco and else 14</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 3 Pottery types from San Luis de Acatlan. where further north along the Pacific coast, came from Marquelia. Here, too, we found a small hand-modeled head with curled hair and lip labrets, an image of a Negro slave which curiously marks the end of this ancient artistic tradition. Perhaps because of their isolation as well as their superstitions, the people of the Costa Chica have done surprisingly little digging among the ruins. While villagers frequently come across objects when building their mud walled houses or working in the fields, we noted only one instance of surreptitious treasure hunting. A travelling merchant managed to excavate a deep hole in one of the mounds at San Luis and produced several handsome pottery vessels. He apparently intended to keep these finds for he was quickly accused of stealing a horde of gold, his cache was confiscated, and he was then run out of town. Except for the San Luis pottery and a plantation owner's small groups of figurines and jade ornaments, little of the archaeological material can be found locally or in collections elsewhere. Perhaps for this very reason there is as yet only meager indication of the existence of an important sculptural tradition in southern Guerrero. Evidence comes mainly from those sites which are presently occupied and, in all likelihood, sculpture may some day be found in many of the undisturbed sites as well. Several life-sized clay figures, reportedly unearthed in one coastal town during construction work, were said to have been destroyed as "works of the devil." We did not deny the possible truth of the account, although the only fragments of large sculpture collected — a sensitively modeled nose, ear and hand — might also have 15</page><page sequence="11">been part of braseros or effigy incense burners. Immense slab stelae, common in both highland and coastal sites, were placed singly or in groups on the large plazas facing pyramid-mounds or on the summit of these mounds (Fig. 4). While several of the nine stelae at Capulin Chocolate were still upright, similar monuments at other sites had fallen and only with some difficulty were we able to ascertain the absence of markings or carving. Similar undecorated stelae have been noted among the archaeological sites along the coast of Oaxaca. Stylized, columnar, monkey-like figures were found some distance from the main architectural complex at Azoyu, Capulin and Piedras Labradas, but only at the last named site did we find a series of well executed stone sculptures and reliefs. All, for the most part, were executed in essentially the same style. One colossal boulder was carved with a merchant or burden carrier bent over by the weight of his bundle; the figure stood on a particular glyph which characterized several of the Piedras Labradas sculptures. Another stela depicted an elaborately costumed figure with the composite features of the feathered serpent and jaguar. A large jaguar, magnificently carved in the round and deco rated with a necklace of sea shells and glyph pectoral, was curiously Fig. 4 Unmarked stelae located on the plaza before a small earth mound at the Cruz Corazon site. 16 Fig. 4 Unmarked stelae located on the plaza before a small earth mound at the Cruz Corazon site.</page><page sequence="12">headless. Although we could not be certain that this was its original form, the stone showed no break and had been removed in this condition from the ramp of Piedras Labradas' great pyramid. The village women were using several sculptured monuments as grinding stones; a fine relief of a serpent-jaguar-bird monster was still distinguishable although the carving on several larger stones had been totally obliterated. Turtles and enormous serpent heads also found strewn about the site completed the assemblage. These explorations, however limited by the method of surface survey, proved that the Costa Chica is indeed another of Mexico's archaeo logically rich provinces. The majority of sites showed evidence of a long human occupation; those along the coastal plain especially, seem to have been inhabited from Preclassic times in the first millennium B.C. when life in small farming and fishing villages marked the beginning of Mesoamerican civilization. The traces of Guerrero's early peoples hint of their artistic orientation toward the south and east — to the cultures of the Gulf Coast, Oaxaca and along the Pacific coast south into Guatemala. Later, in the first centuries of our era, as the momentum of New World civilization increased, southern Guerrero apparently felt the strong impulse of Monte Alban and Teotihuacan, both sophisti cated and intellectual centers of the Classic era. Without adequate investigation it is more difficult to speculate on the course of events during the subsequent Postclassic epoch. Other regions of Mesoamerica were beset by warfare, civil strife and conquest but southern Guerrero appears not to have been adversely affected for its towns seem to have grown and prospered until the Conquest brought about the end of all Indian civilization in Mesoamerica.
