<plain_text><page sequence="1">"keeping pace with the visual revolution": Intermediary Reference in Gertrude Stein's Prose Poems Tender Buttons and Wyndham Lewis's Novel Tarr Antje Kley ABSTRACT This essay is concerned with intermediality, especially in the form of intermediary reference, as a flexible creative adaptation of media-specific aesthetic concepts, structures or possibilities- here from the visual arts and cubism in particular- into a new media context- here the modernist text. Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons and Wyndham Lewis's Tarr, two much neglected modernist texts, are studied for their thematization, evocation or reproduction of a Cubist visual aesthetics in order to evaluate form and function of these adaptations for the texts' poetic respectively nov- elistic processes of meaning production. In very different innovative ways, both texts deal with the artifice of surfaces in order to conceptualize the discontinuities of experience. Stein's and Lewis's work is thus shown to present unique attempts to 'keep pace with the visual revolution' at the be- ginning of the twentieth century. Intermediality as Modernist Experiment Since the 1990s, "intermediality" has become a much discussed paradigm in liter- ary and cultural studies.1 As an umbrella term, it generally refers to the transgression of boundaries between traditionally distinct media. Intermedial transgressions pro- liferate in times of rapid social and intellectual change, in the face of which tradition- al means of representation seem exhausted or at least limited. At the present cultural moment, it is mainly the formally hybrid contemporary art scene with its acoustic ar- chitectures, danced texts, hyperfictions and other artistic crossovers which suggests that investigations of plurimediality, mediatransformation, and intermediary refer- ence will yield promising lines of inquiry (cf. Rajewsky 1-27; Greenblatt 13-15). Within the more specific context of literary studies, references to music, film, paint- ing, and other transpositions d'art can be found in much contemporary literature by such authors as e.g. Raymond Federman, Robert Coover and Richard Powers, Sal- man Rushdie, John Fowles, Adam Thorpe, and Peter Ackroyd. But the phenomenon is far from new. As Werner Wolfs work testifies, Romanticism and its legacy call as much for detailed and carefully contextualized intermediary readings as do literary modernism and its tacit dialogues with the other arts. Werner Wolf considers "a liter- ature-centered investigation of contacts between verbal art works and other media" an indispensable analytical line of inquiry for the proper understanding of the histo- ry and function of modernist texts ("Intermedialität" 85, 111). In the present essay, 1 Cf.

From the turn of the nineteenth and into the twentieth century, fundamental changes manifested themselves in the development of mass culture, and a wealth of discoveries and innovations in media and transportation technology, science and philosophy marked an incisive break with the Victorian age and the American gen- teel tradition. Within a time span of only a few years the world saw the isolation of radium, the discovery of X-rays, the invention of the light bulb, wireless telegraphy, the cinematograph, and the Zeppelin air ship, the rise of the automobile, streetcars and underground railways, as well as Freud's 'talking cure,' the Lebensphilosophie of Bergson and Nietzsche, and the definition of quantum theory. These changes vi- tally transformed the modern city and the perception and conceptualization of the relationship between the subject and the world. Around 1900, the "continuity" snapped, Henry Adams observed in his 1907 autobiographical investigation of the meaning of modern history: "the break of continuity amounted to abysmal fracture for a historian's subjects" (381). With the turn of the century, as Malcolm Bradbury writes, "[t]he world had ceased to be a unity and become a multiple, the human mind had taken on a new relationship to power and force" (251). These develop- ments had their artistic counterpart in the beginning of the twentieth century within a cosmopolitan and experimentalist transatlantic artistic scene located prominently in London and Paris. As Wyndham Lewis would later and with characteristic fervor put it, "Europe was full of titanic stirrings and snortings- a new art coming into flower to celebrate or announce a 'new age'" (qtd. in Bradbury 261). Bradbury maintains that "it was roughly the same band of years- the two decades just before the Great War- that saw the great massing of the social, scientific and technological changes we name modern, and the birth of the avant-garde arts" (273).2 Wyndham Lewis and Gertrude Stein are two modernist writers who, in very dif- ferent ways, were an integral part of the Paris and London visual and literary art scenes, but whose literary work is often considered obscure.3 Stein is well known as a patron of Cubist art and her own work is frequently labeled "Cubist" (cf. Steiner 132); Lewis was a painter himself and sought to realize his Vorticist ideas, them- selves highly indebted to Cubist work, in his writing. In this article, their work, how- ever, is subject to analysis not primarily for the authors' interest in painting, nor for an isolation of the presumably abstractable aesthetic content of visual and verbal art forms. Stein's and Lewis's texts are studied for the ways in which they adopt from Cubist painting the formal inquiry of their own medium: that of writing. In this context, it is important to keep in mind that the term "Cubism" means different things when applied to literature and when applied to painting: "Cubism 2 In the context of these fundamental changes, we also see the enormous diversification of nar- rative form, content, and function known as the "turn of the novel" (Friedman; Bradbury, Mod- ern British Novel 1-66; Reinfandt 216-33). 3 The literary work of both writers is only slowly emerging from a dominantly biographical treatment. However, there has been significant work done on Stein's and Lewis's writing since critical frameworks of interpretation have begun to catch up with it during the 1980s.</page><page sequence="3">"keeping pace with the visual revolution" 517 is a term that has no precise or literal meaning when applied to literature, though it has a dense and precise historical meaning when applied to painting" (Dasen- brock 10). Unable to define Cubism as "either a style, the art of a specific group or even a movement," the art historian Christopher Green describes Cubism as a concept "embracing] widely disparate work" in the visual arts, loosely united in "formal concerns regarding the conventions of representation and the dissolution of three-dimensional form" (239). On the basis of Green's general definition, the following essay provides an analysis of how and to what effect Stein's prose poems Tender Buttons (1914) and Lewis's novel Tarr (1918) adopt and transform a Cubist program in writing, how and to what effect they use a Cubist visual aesthetics as a medium for a conceptual dialogue with the visual arts on the dimensions of time and space. These readings will attest to the enormous flexibility of different kinds of modernist narrative and to their potential to make available in writing a sense of the newly transformed relationship between representation and the world, be- tween the individual and reality. "a rested development": Cubist Painting and Gertrude Stein's Tender Buttons Despite the difficulties involved in defining a brief, heterogeneous and enor- mously influential movement cut short by the First World War (cf. Berger 71-92), Cubism is generally considered "the first and most influential of all movements in twentieth-century art" (Green 239). We call 'Cubist' the abstract or non-figurative paintings by Picasso, Braque, Gris, and others that emerged out of Paris before the First World War and which marked a more radical break with the visual arts tradi- tion of five centuries than even Kandinski's expressionist color accords presented in München in 1911/12 (cf. Gombrich 570).4 In the artistic conflict between impres- sionistic pattern and a more solid and permanent form, Paul Cézanne first attempt- ed to work against impressionist dissolution of structure, contour, and composition and to render depth without sacrificing the brightness of colors.5 Cézanne turned against the long-established early Renaissance convention of rendering the illu- sion of depth with toned-down colors and shade, a convention which indicated the direction the light comes in. His Stilleben (1879-82, fig. 1) successfully presents three dimensions without pretending that the canvas has more than two. Cézanne suggested to "deal with nature as cylinders, spheres and cones" and thus to super- sede representation and an interest in its subject with analysis and an interest in form (Monnier 371; cf. also Walker 5-13; O'Connor 97-98). Walker argues that Cé- zanne departed from the ideal of unmediated vision which is indebted to John Ruskin's nineteenth-century doctrine of the "innocence of the eye." He was con- scious of the fact that "his was not an 'innocent eye,' that his observations were al- ways mediated by his awareness of the concrete resources of his medium" (Walker 11, 5-13). Knowing that he could not reproduce nature, but must represent it by color, "Cezanne's surface designs were conceived in an effort to create a perfect 4 On the pitfalls of the term 'abstraction,' see also Steiner (134-35). 5 Cf.

These ideas prompted Picasso to paint not what he saw (not at least according to the principles of art which teach how to see things) and not to attempt in an impressionist manner to ban a fleeting moment onto the canvas, but to construct a permanent image out of single parts. In his Stillife with Violin and Grapes (1912, fig. 2), for example, different perspectives that are present simultaneously in our mind's eye are put onto the canvas in a structured way. The formal game was to construct the tangible and solid image of a physical object from a few incorporeal suggestions. As Guillaume Apollinaire put it in 1913: "Cubism differs from the old schools of painting in that it aims, not at an art of imi- tation, but an art of conception, which tends to rise to the height of creation" (17). 6 6 Analyzing Cubist works, art historians conventionally distinguish between an early analytical phase (supposedly more strongly based on the study of things) and a later synthetic (and more purely inventive) phase. Green problematizes this distinction particularly with reference to Picas- so's work. He argues: "broadly speaking, Picasso, Braque, and Gris did tend more to 'synthetic' procedures after 1912 [first use of insertion of words, collage, and papier collé]. Their work prior to 1912, however, was not exclusively 'analytical' and synthesis or invention was a key factor in their Cubism from the beginning. Invention and a conceptual rather than a perceptual view of art are related preoccupations in Cubism" (243).</page><page sequence="5">"keeping pace with the visual revolution" 519 Figure 2 Gertrude Stein greatly admired the new analytical and inventive rather than representational mode of realism first in Cezanne's and later in Picasso's painting, and her own writing of the time was deeply indebted to this vision (cf. Walker 127- 49). Even the title Tender B uttons- tenderness tends not to be our first associa- tion with buttons- is indicative of its suggestive literary aesthetics, freed from the constriction of representational organization. Stein's verbal still lives are playful pieces which project onto the page different non-referential or associative per- spectives seemingly dislodged from the control of the conscious, purposive mind. The portrayal of inanimate objects (occasionally animated with human qualities and invested with erotic overtones) allowed Stein to delight in everyday life from many different perspectives and to systematically separate herself from represent- ing things as she cognitively knew or remembered them (cf. Stein, "Portraits and Repetition"; O'Connor 97-99, 115-20).7 By presenting a stylistic surface that "strenuously [...] resists this habitual tendency to dissolve into familiar images of the human and social world" (Walker 15), Stein's enigmatic prose poems thus ef- fect a forceful disruption of conventional reading practices- a disruption which might prompt readers to feel, as one anonymous contemporary reviewer put it, 7 About everyday objects in Cubist painting, see Gombrich 574 and O'Connor 99-115.</page><page sequence="6">520 Antje Kley "like going out and pulling the Fime Bank Building over onto [themselves]" (14).8 With their unfeigned reaction, however, these readers will miss Stein's attempt to capture in writing the ideologically mediated artifice involved in the conscious un- derstanding of the immediacy of experience. Stein's work defamiliarizes the famil- iar and thus temporarily effects and eventually denies the critical distance that seems so central to dominant accounts of modernism- which assume that the modernist text provides an autonomous alternative to mass culture and the femi- nine. While Walker emphasizes the distancing effects within Stein's work, pointing to her "brilliantly subversive demonstration of the unbreachable gulf that sepa- rates the chaotic plenitude of the sensory world from the arbitrary order of lan- guage" (xviii), Pitchford stresses the limits of this aesthetic distancing effect when she refers to the "objection underlying Tender Buttons that all representation in fact shapes reality into social categories of meaning rather than reflecting it" (663). This double demonstration is reserved, however, for those readers willing to surrender to the obstructive lure of Stein's prose poems. Surrendering in that sense, I propose to read the introductory piece of Tender Buttons as giving us a key (musical rather than in terms of 'lock and key') to the entire collection9: A CARAFE, THAT IS A BLIND GLASS. A kind in glass and a cousin, a spectacle and nothing strange a single hurt color and an arrangement in a system to pointing. All this and not ordinary, not unordered in not re- sembling. The difference is spreading. (3) The poem consists of a heading, two verbless phrases and a final short programmatic sentence. Its single verb "is" is an instance of the collection's preference for decep- tively simple verbs of being. These are often used to propose logically absurd identi- ties, for example "Dirty is yellow" in "A PIECE OF COFFEE" (5) or "Very little cake is water" in "ROOMS" (50). The poem makes use of the vivid, concrete, and noun-based vocabulary that characterizes the entire collection. "[Arrangement," a recurring word throughout the collection, appears here in a phrase which indicates the way in which words (nouns mostly) are given meaning in these poems: they are "an arrangement in a system to pointing," in a system which directs the reader's or listener's focus of attention, rather than pointing beyond themselves to the objects they denote. These arrangements follow laws of sound and rhythm, rather than those of semantic or syntactic meaning. There is, for example, a wealth of alliterations ("spectacle," "strange," "system," "spreading"), repetitions ("a cousin," "a specta- cle," "a single hurt color," "a system," "not ordinary," "not unordered," "not resem- bling"), as well as homonyms and vowel changes in echoed words ("ordinary" vs. "unordered"). The pieces also often exhibit an experimental manipulation of spell- ing, rhythm, and sound, such as "Alas a dirty word, alas a dirty third alas a dirty third, alas a dirty bird" in "CHICKEN" (35), "Egg ear nuts, look a bout" in "DINNER" (36), or "It is so a noise to be" in "EATING" (37). These sensual arrangements of 8 Pitchford discusses some of the dismissive reactions to Stein's writing by contemporary and later critics. y Cf. Walker 135-36; Bowers 88-89; Haselstein 197-2ÜÜ.</page><page sequence="7">"keeping pace with the visual revolution" 521 words and phrases are part of "an arrangement in a system to pointing," a system which directs us to adjust our perceptual apparatus to see or hear what we usually take to be transparent signifiers to another reality beyond the materiality of the words themselves. As playful puzzles, Stein's anti-representational arrangements do not only invite, but impel us to look at the words, rather than only through them. Take the carafe from the poem's title: We readily assume a carafe to be a trans- parent, possibly artfully cut and therefore sparkling object. The poem's title, how- ever, calls it "a blind glass," stressing that it is not transparent, and also diminishing the idea of its sparkle. The word "spectacle" takes up the double idea of surface and depth, since it denotes both, something to see (better) through and a visual object or performance to marvel at. Through the s-sounds, "spectacle" is also connected to the other parts of the poem's first phrase, which indicate different kinds and degrees of similitude. "A kind in glass" stresses similarity, "a cousin" is of the same family, but not of the same parents, "nothing strange" promises familiarity, "a single hurt color" might be a transcription for relation by blood, whereas "an arrangement in a system to pointing" suggests the deliberate production of an artifice which assumes systematic function: that of pointing, of directing attention. In these different de- grees of similitude, objects lose their solidity, singularity, and definition. Clear and precise categories of perception and knowing are thus playfully undermined and washed away. Anti-referential aesthetic possibilities unfold which may be read as encoding a pleasurable and secretly proliferating erotic transgression (cf. McCabe 75-77). The second phrase of "A CARAFE THAT IS A BLIND GLASS" describes "[a]ll this"- all these different relationships, the idea of depth vs. surface, the poem itself- as neither "ordinary" nor "unordered in not resembling." All this is not "or- dinary," but it claims an order even- or, possibly, in particular- where it is not ap- parent. "The difference is spreading," subsequently announces the closing sentence, passing interpretive authority over the playful puzzle on to the reader. As the col- lection progresses, programmatic meta-statements like this last sentence- the pres- ence of which Steiner reads as "one of the most obvious similarities between Cub- ism and Steinian writing of all phases" (157)- surreptitiously recur, most prominently so in the last section, "Rooms" (cf. Bowers 100): "Act so that there is no use in a center" and "all order is in a measure" (43, 50). "Lecture, lecture and re- peat instruction" at the end of "MUTTON" (26) even self-reflexively parodies such statements on the activity encoded in these prose poems. Characteristically, the first poem exhibits a preference for selection, metaphor, and pun over contextual combination and metonymy, and a de-familiarized, some- times fractured, paratactic syntax, which appears to make sense, but dazzles and thus parodies rational referential discourse (cf. Isaak 24-50).10 In the form of a rid- 10 Critics keep referring back to Stein's own distinction between her early method of avoiding nouns in favor of long métonymie sentence structures, used in The Making of Americans, and her subsequent attempt in Tender Buttons to meet nouns head on by relying on metaphor and short, paratactic phrases. See Stein, "Poetry and Grammar." The distinction between these two styles is frequently associated with the "metaphoric" and the "métonymie" in the work of the linguist Ro- man Jakobson and the psychologist William James, with whom Stein studied at Radcliffe (cf. Dubnick 28-44; Meyer 94-96, 115).</page><page sequence="8">522 Antje Kley die, the introductory poem displays- it makes a spectacle of- a programmatically Cubist confusion of its material, "words as things," and subject matter, "words as signifiers of things," explicitly making the medium its message (Steiner 157). As a programmatic riddle, the introductory poem can key us in to what alternately seems like semantic excess or claustrophobia and leaves us unsure of our control of a text that may seem empty to the degree that it is full of itself. The effect is that, as Ellen Berry aptly puts it in her account of the kind of attention required by Stein's writing, "[o]ur desire as readers to structure our experience of the text must necessarily in- teract with [...] the power of the text [...] to structure (or déstructure) our experi- ence" (33). In comparison to contemporaneous Imagist writing, Stein's prose poems demand a more active participation by the reader, who is not given a ready grasp of an object, but who is submitted to a process of exploring the set of assumptions through which the object is known as what it is (cf. Pitchford 646; Haselstein 199). Stein's prose poems are an exploration of writing and grammar as the means for making sense in language as much as visual Cubist work embodies an exploration of painting and the geometrical laws of space (cf. Steiner 136; Apollinaire 12; Dub- nick 63-84). While the pieces presented in Tender Buttons retain, like Cubist paint- ing, representational traces- here to the pleasurable household space evoked, as the subtitle indicates, by Objects, Food, Rooms11 - , they are centrally concerned with the materiality of the medium and, by obstructing the flow of the reading ex- perience, they exhibit the plasticity of the word. Walker maintains that Stein's "commitment to the reality of immediate experience was always matched- if not mastered- by her intense awareness of the separate but equal reality of language" (1, xiv). And Walker underlines that "Tender Buttons is not derivative from paint- ing, but a logical product of Stein's parallel investigation of the same fundamental issue that preoccupied Cézanne and then Picasso and Braque: the problem of rep- resentation, redefined in terms of the distinctive resources of their medium" (xvi- xvii). As much as did the Cubist painters, Stein attempted to render the depth of human experience without pretending to have recourse to a transparent medium which would allow her to simply put a mirror to it.12 The distinctive resources of writing and painting differ considerably, however, in their mode of signifying and in their dominant relationship to the dimensions of time and space (cf. Steiner 141-60). 13 The medium of writing- language- is a closed system of signs, whereas the media of painting, color and shape, consist of compara- tively non-significant material. This is probably one reason why Cubist painting is much more firmly established than non-narrative literary work such as Stein's. Nonetheless, as Walker remarks, both media structurally feed on "the transforma- tive power of juxtaposition": "language brings things to mind by calling their names, and sounds and syntax can create relationships among them that are as complex and 11 Feminist readings have emphasized Stein's concealed celebration of lesbian desire in Tender Buttons (cf. Dickie 18-36; McCabe). 12 On the logic of linguistic evocation of the material world in Tender Buttons, see Haselstein. 13 Steiner presents a good analysis of Cubist painting, but in the context of her study, she main- ly deals with Stein's early writing and fails to see anything but "'numinous' objects" in Tender Buttons (156).</page><page sequence="9">"keeping pace with the visual revolution" 523 multiple as the ones in cubist collage" (134, 133). Given the sequential character of language, however, writing is an art in time, whereas the visual arts gain significance in space. In his comparison of the late antique Laokoon-group and Virgil's treat- ment of the Laokoon incident in the Aeneid, the German author and philosopher of the Enlightenment, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, sought to break with Horace's dic- tum "ut pictura poesis," which had granted primacy to painting over writing. There- fore Lessing defined the specific semiotic quality of the verbal and visual media by distinguishing between their objects as bodies in space and action in time. In this re- spect, Cubist painting and Stein's writing in Tender Buttons bring the two media closer together. Cubism achieves a conceptual representation of time within the generally spa- tial art of painting. John Berger explains that Cubist painting combines disconti- nuity of space with a continuity of structure, thereby creating the possibility of art revealing processes instead of static entities. The content of [Cubist] art consists of various modes of interaction: the interaction between different aspects of the same event, between empty space and filled space, between structure and movement, between the seer and things seen. Rather than ask a Cubist picture: Is it true? or: Is it sin- cere? one should ask: Does it continue? (86) The Cubist visual image includes the temporal in the spatial: with its polycentric design, it captures the flow of time in an "eternalizing space" which Apollinaire called the "fourth dimension" (12). This 'fourth dimension' refers to the effect of 'seeing around' space: It "implies for the perceiver a liberation from the fetters of his own static position. He is to be able to see as a simultaneity what before was visible to him only as a function of time. [...] Such a treatment is conceptual; it shows that the perception of an object is colored by previous knowledge about it" (Steiner 141). In contrast to the Cubist visual representation of time, movement or change in painting, Stein's prose poems arrest time into single moments of percep- tion within the generally temporal art of narrative. The written image converts "the dynamic into the static, the temporal into the spatial" (Lodge 103). It cap- tures a crystallized moment and thus presents, as Stein puts it in "END OF SUM- MER," "a rested development" (33). Addressing the issue of time from opposite directions, both visual and verbal images function as means to explore and depart from their respective media's long-established representational logic. In their me- dia-specific ways they playfully demonstrate that the dream of a direct, unspoiled, and unmediated vision (the 'innocent eye') is necessarily an illusion, the letting go of which Tender Buttons presents as a liberating experience rather than as painful loss (cf. Meyer 116; Walker 148). In place of the tired dream of exact mimetic rep- resentation, Stein's prose poems support the pursuit of an intimate comprehen- sion of both the limiting and enabling laws of language. "the sunlit pagan surface of the earth": Vorticism and Wyndham Lewis's Tarr Wyndham Lewis was a prolific painter, writer, and critic throughout his life. During the years after the hiatus of the First World War, he republished most of his writings, reinventing himself as a modernist artist polemically critical of mod-</page><page sequence="10">524 Antje Kley ernism and with ambivalent protofascist leanings (cf. Miller 67-120; Sherry 138- 50). 14 For the present context, however, I will focus on the Vorticist aesthetics Lewis developed before the First World War. As Dasenbrock confirms, this visual aesthetics functions as a laboratory for a modernist articulation of a space-logic which "had its enduring impact on literature" by challenging narrative's sequen- tial time-logic (63, 85, 140-51).15 As "one of the first British artists to be aware of, and interested in, Cubism and Expressionsim" (Humphreys 287-88), Lewis was assimilating Cubist style into his own visual work from 1911 on (cf. Edwards 53-54). Lewis's early pencil drawing Girl Asleep (1911; fig. 3), for example, divides the image into geometric planes. The drawing does not yet constitute an analytical Cubist work, however, since the planes "coincide spatially pretty exactly with the forms of naturalistic rendition" (Edwards 56). The same rigid geometricized construction and its limited vocabu- lary of signs generates a tense and muscular figure in Smiling Woman Ascending a Stair (1912, fig. 4). Some of Lewis's subsequent paintings, like The Dancers (1912, fig. 5) or A Feast of Overmen (1912, fig. 6)- one of his illustrations of Shakes- peare's short, schematic portrait of a corrupt urban society in Timon of Athens- , display a further dislocation of figurai articulation. This formal dislocation ini- tiates a successive dispersal of the integral human figure as the center of meaning, "a complement of the preoccupation with the integrity of the self in the modern world," into a more general texture: the isolated human figure becomes an anach- ronism (Edwards 112, 113). Even though Lewis's paintings initially retained more of a representational logic than did Picasso's, Cubist division of the image does serve his work more than a merely decorative function. With his Vorticist ideas, Lewis successfully strove to convey the multiply determined quality of life within a new social reality. Vorticism was a short-lived movement across the arts, founded by Lewis and Ezra Pound in 1914 subsequent to Lewis's rhetorically violent fall-out with Roger Fry and the Bloomsbury group's 'tasteful' and 'provincial' aesthetics. The concept of the 'vortex' as the point of energetic concentration at the heart of a whirlpool of energy was adopted to promote a vigorously defiant movement against Victorian taste and sensibility, 'effeminate' politeness, and a superficial and ineffectual kind of humor. As a partisan and aggressive call for renewal, Vorticist art sought to meet the challenge of the machine age while sharing neither the Futurists' eager excitement about the effects of industrialization nor their missionary zeal: where Futurism unreservedly saw a model in technological progress, Vorticism used methods and procedures adopted from technology (straight lines, sharp angles, vi- sual patterns, repetitions) while ideologically striving to keep a critical distance. As Dasenbrock argues, "the Vorticist painters use an abstract or dehumanized 14 For a contextualization of Lewis's politics and an analysis of how they manifest themselves in his fiction, see Jameson and Corbett. 15 Modernist space logic as a replacement for a sequential time-logic in narrative technique has been systematically explicated by Frank.

Lewis asserted his ar- tistic leadership of the movement with his aptly titled journal Blast, which saw only three issues before the movement's "playful violence was eclipsed by the real violence of the First World War" (Edwards 100).17 Nevertheless, Cork maintains, between 1914 and 1916, the Vorticists "manage[d] to produce an impressive range of images which sustained their claim to revitalize British art" (701). Vorticism was strongly influenced by developments in French painting, whose intervention into the tight bind between the language of painting and mimetic imi- tation enabled an unprecedented degree of experimentation and a dedication to the artistic creation of a poetic reality rather than of mimetic illusion. Lewis and Pound conceived of Vorticism in opposition to Cubism and Futurism in particular and, to a lesser degree, also to Expressionism. This opposition, however, reveals the movement's deep indebtedness: on the basis of a specifically Bergsonian ten- sion between matter and spirit, Vorticism combined Cubist articulation of form and pictorial space with a Futurist articulation of dynamic movement (cf. Edwards 60-94; Sherry 147-49).18 Lewis developed what Edwards calls a "'compromise' idi- om [...] from Cubism and Futurism, retaining the expressive power of the feel of the body, yet showing it as snagged in the material world with its energy transects" (Edwards 87). Lewis thus made a disciplined attempt to put abstraction at the ser- vice of representation, rather than rejecting representation altogether. He devel- oped a conceptual representationalism, "based on machine and architectural forms," which balks at the possibility of transcending the material world and which allowed him to capture a sense of the painful contingency of modern identity con- struction onto the canvas (Humphreys 287; cf. also Dasenbrock 62-77). Edwards explains this conceptual representationalism of individual identity as follows: The procedure analogises the construction of identity in modern societies from the city's varied levels of organisation: intangible networks as well as the more obvious streets, communication and transport systems. Such identities are not simply free and emancipat- ed pick-and-mix constructions from the cornucopia of modernity; Lewis at all times had an Althusserian sense of the ways in which the systematic determinism of modern societ- ies masquerades as personal autonomy. (125) The way in which Vorticism takes up and departs from Cubist abstraction, pro- vides an apposite set of descriptors for the formally rather conventional novel Tarr (1918): the novel, too, is an attempt at an abstract representationalism.19 In 16 Dasenbrock 47; cf. also Cork 701; Orchard 9-21; Gaßner 22-37; Seeber 335-36. 17 All three issues of Blast have been reprinted by Black Sparrow Press between 1981 and 1984. 18 For an account of Lewis's ambivalent attitude towards Bergson; see also Kush. 19 Lewis wrote Tarr between 1907-14.

In order to assess the novel's critical place, it makes sense to consider briefly Lewis's poetics at the time. Before the First World War, Lewis thought that his lit- erary contemporaries were "not keeping pace with the visual revolution" and its rejection of photographic mimesis and the mimetic theory of art (Lewis, Rude As- signment 139; cf. also Dasenbrock 129; Miller 88). Therefore, in his play Enemy of the Stars (1914), Lewis "attempted to introduce the stark imagery and style of the new art into a complex and poetic prose," and the piece itself stages an onslaught on the means of narration which still finds few parallels in British or American writing (Humphreys 287; cf. also Miller 67).20 In this seven-scene montage text, which is situated in the distant future and features three unnamed male charac- ters, conventional narrative passages alternate with grammatically experimental ones with few conjugated verbs and ambiguously connected, immobile phrases in the place of sentences. The text thus "avoid[s] specifying temporal relations"- a technique which makes reading quite literally a puzzle (Dasenbrock 127-51; 131; cf. also Miller 88-93). According to Thomas Kush, the staging of Enemy of the Stars, this "rite enacted in a vague visionary realm, where metaphysical forces ap- pear in the form of abstract blocks of color," succeeds as "the closest approxima- tion to the visual art of any of Lewis' writings" (63). Compared with Enemy of the Stars, Tarr seems, at least in formal terms, to re- turn to narrative normalcy. For Lewis himself, the anti-narrative modernism of Enemy of the Stars was a dead end because, as Dasenbrock suggests, its quasi Im- agist "show-case sentences" proved too static to keep the narrative moving: "nothing leads up to" the self-contained image, "and it in turn leads up to noth- ing" (131).21 Nonetheless, both Dasenbrock and Edwards agree on the central sty- listic innovation of the gesture that is Enemy of the Stars- i.e., its replacement of the sentence by the phrase which anticipates the stylistic direction of Pound, Eliot, and Joyce (cf. Dasenbrock 135-51; Edwards 36; Klein). In a frequently quoted passage from his 1950 autobiography Rude Assignment, Lewis voices his retro- spective skepticism about his earlier attempts at an abstract modernist language which would deaden narrative: It became evident to me at once, however, when I started to write a novel, that words and syntax were not susceptible to transformation into abstract terms, to which process the vi- sual arts lent themselves quite readily. The coming of war and the writing- at top 20 Foshay calls the play an "inversion of the genre of drama" and an "unperformable" depar- ture from dramatic action "which must in fact be read like a novel" designed as a literary embod- iment of the preexisting philosophical problem of the "irreconcilability of mind and body, idea and activity" (45, 49). Lewis wrote the play for the first issue of Blast 51-85. 11 Dasenbrock calls the text "a terrible botch of a narrative, because the narrative is deliberate- ly botched" and maintains that the "real significance of the play is a gesture" (133, 135).</page><page sequence="15">"keeping pace with the visual revolution" 529 speed- of a full-length novel [Tarr] was the turning point. Writing- literature- dragged me out of the abstractist cul-de-sac. (138-39) In spite of its syntactic truce with narrative and time, Tarr is not the return to an altogether pre-modern narrative which Lewis's own retrospective statement might suggest. Working against this impression is the text's aggressive intensity, its paratactic staccato sentences, and, above all, a formal design which analytically accentuates the mechanistic view of human social behavior embodied in its pro- tagonists. These techniques continue to attack the temporal suppositions of narra- tive and the prominent role of plot without frontally assaulting narrative itself (cf. Dasenbrock 137, 151, 157-58). Tarr is narrated by a covert third person or heterodiegetic narrator who moves in and out of internal and external focalization, giving us access to the characters' perspectives in direct speech and free indirect discourse as well as commenting on those perspectives. Some critics miss the narrator's flexibility: Foshay, for exam- ple, reads the narrative perspective as simply an omniscient one (cf. 69). Miller (cf. 100-11) stresses with Messerli (cf. 289) Lewis's skillfully anti-conventional narra- tive manipulation of voice; he suggests that the occasional "formal awkwardness and 'flawed' narration of Tarr, at once reveals Lewis's departure from modernist conceptions of significant form and anticipates the rhetorical tools Lewis would use in his satirical and polemical sallies" (111). In particular, Lewis's texts exhibit a tendency to work against the realist convention of an anthropomorphic identifi- cation between speaker and person, voice and body (cf. Miller). A central exam- ple of that is the dual voice narrating Kreisler's rape of Bertha in the perpetrator's studio, where she sits for him as a model. Kreisler's sexually aggressive act is rep- resented in the narrator's and Bertha's almost disembodied subsequent cognitive apprehension of it: He was standing there at the window now as though wishing to pretend that he had done nothing; she 'had been dreaming things,' merely. The long silence and monotony of the posing had prepared her for the strangeness now. It had been the other extreme out of which she had been flung and into which, at present, she was again flung. She saw side by side and unconnected, the silent figure drawing her and the other one full of blindness and violence. Then there were two other figures, one getting up from the chair, yawning, and the present lazy one at the window- four in all, that she could not bring together somehow, each in a complete compartment of time of its own. [...] She now had to go away as though nothing had happened. It was nothing. After all, what did it matter what became of her now? [...] She was let out as a workman would have been, who had been there to mend a shutter or rectify a bolt. (194-95) With its jarring perspective on a jarring act, this short excerpt is characteristic of Lewis's style, which, as Jameson aptly puts it, "hammers the reified world into a forbiddingly cubist surface" and "blasts through the tissue of his novels like a steam whistle, breaking them to its will" (81, 25). Jameson's reading of Lewis's plainly sexist, racist or protofascist diction not as a matter of taste, but as a funda- mental aesthetic problem is convincing: Lewis's "artistic integrity is to be con- ceived, not as something distinct from his regrettable ideological lapses (as when we admire his art in spite of his opinions), but rather in the very intransigence with</page><page sequence="16">530 Antje Kley which he makes himself the impersonal registering apparatus for forces which he means to record, beyond any whitewashing and liberal revisionism" (21). In seven parts covering a time span of about 20 days, Tarr presents a satiric and profoundly unsympathetic portrait and critique of the bourgeois-bohemian scene of early twentieth-century Montparnasse and its concept of an authentic life- style.22 The reader is introduced to two artists: the would-be self-confident En- glishman Tarr and the personally as well as artistically ineffective German Kre- isler. The narrative is structured around these two characters' intertwined plights for either a clear segregation or a successful integration of ascetic artistic refine- ment and bourgeois sexual indulgence.23 Tarr's inability to separate from Bertha Lunken and, with her, from everything he sees as opposed to the artistic principle, forms the center of parts I, V, and VII of the book. Tarr appears as a rational observer of the dystopian Montparnasse art scene, one who would like to be more detached from his own sensuality than he is in order to create what he considers the supreme work of art, namely himself: "the artist is he in whom the emotionality normally absorbed by sex is so strong," he explains to another artist, "that it claims a newer and more exclusive field of deployment. = Its first creation is the Artist himself, a new sort of person; the cre- ative man" (29). 24 Wanting to be authentic, but sticking to his abstract and polar- ized conception of the art-life relation, he cannot master the conflict between Apollonian and Dionysian impulses, which he considers to have precipitated Kre- isler's downfall: "I believe that all the fuss he made was an attempt to get out of Art back into Life again, like a fish flopping about who had got into the wrong tank. [...] = He was trying to get back into sex again out of a little puddle of art where he felt he was gradually expiring" (302). Like the penniless and dourly instinctual 36-year-old art student Kreisler, who is at the center of parts II through IV, Tarr can never live both sides of the art-life di- alectic at once. Tarr and Kreisler actually have more in common than their oppo- sitional characterization initially implies. Both of them are "restless, quick flame- like" egos (300) who are mainly concerned with themselves (cf. Levy 52; Kramer 253-62; Jameson 95).25 Kreisler, however, is the more sinister and aggressive, more militantly misogynistic of the two. In his incapacitating restlessness, he rapes Ber- 22 Klein suggests that Tarr is named after Poe's "The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether," pointing to an analogy between the parodie society of the madhouse in Poe's narrative and the bourgeois-bohemian scene of Montparnasse in Lewis's novel (cf. 28). 23 The two artists may be read as programmatic incarnations of the self-controlled Vorticist and a paranoid Futurist (cf. Dasenbrock 51 and Gaßner 24). Jameson proposes to read the superior Englishman Tarr and the furiously humiliated German Kreisler as national allegories (cf. 90-96) and as unrefined prototypes "of the genius or strong personality and the average mediocrity of 'mass man'" (101). For a more recent account of nationality in Tarr, see Peppis 133-61. 24 Critics disagree about Lewis's use of the equal sign as a form of punctuation. Dasenbrock reads it as a "connective device" in some places, in others as "highlighting] the absence of any continuity" between sentences (155, 156). 25 On the basis of his reading of Tarr as national allegory, Jameson questions Tarr's observer's aloofness and security as an illusion which hides the fact that "the British Empire is inextricably and structurally involved in and dependent on the outside world" (95).</page><page sequence="17">"keeping pace with the visual revolution" 531 tha, accidentally kills Soltyk, his rival for artistic and sexual attention, in an absurd duel, and then commits suicide. Both, 'cultured' Tarr and 'loud-mouthed' Kreisler, project their own artistic and sexual shortcomings on the women they meet, the sentimentally passive, bourgeois-bohemian and emotionally unstable German Bertha Lunken (cf. 68) and the self-confident, financially and sexually autono- mous Russian-German Anastasya Vasek, respectively.26 Both men hate their own emotional distress and sense of uselessness in these two women. In comparison to Kreisler, however, Tarr is allowed a rather painless exit from the problems they both face- though to different degrees- even if the way Tarr's story winds down into indifference unfavorably contrasts with the self-confident way he first pre- sents himself. Both of them finally accomplish nothing. Kreisler 's telling name indicates that he's conceived as an outer-directed ma- chine generating the momentum of the narrative. As a rotating and ridiculous epitome of male self-sufficiency and violence, "Kreisler moves through the novel in a series of vortical gyrations that functions as his principal mode of engagement with others and that generates the force field surrounding him" (Wutz 846). For short periods of time, Kreisler performs as "one of those little steam toys" (117) and "a rusty machine [thirsty] for action" (150) at the dance at the Bonnington Club, when he rapes Bertha, and in the duel; subsequently, his residual energies idle down, most significantly when Soltyk, refusing to kiss Kreisler to forgo the duel, finally attacks him: "'Acha-acha-' a noise, the beginning of a word, came from his mouth. He sank on his knees. A notion of endless violence filled him. Tchun-tchun-tchun-tchun-tchun-tchun! He fell on his back, and the convulsive arms came with him. The strangling sensation at his neck intensified" (273). Lewis's abstract portrayals of the characters' main traits, taken out of the flux of time which conditions them, gain definition in contradistinction to the portrayal of the personal in the work of James Joyce or D.H. Lawrence. While these writers were also working against linear continuity in their texts, Lewis had a strong anti- pathy against their valorization of temporality, flux, and temporal subjectivity which involved the illusion of an unmediated apprehension of the outside world (cf. Quéma 38-41; Jameson 84-86 and Fn20): To put this matter in a nutshell, it is the shell of the animal that the plastically-minded art- ist will prefer. The ossature is my favorite part of a living animal organism, not its intes- tines. My objections to Mr. D.H. Lawrence were chiefly concerned with that regrettable habit of his incessantly to refer to the intestinal billowing of the 'dark' subterranean pas- sion. In his devotion to that romantic abdominal Within he abandoned the sunlit pagan surface of the earth. (Lewis, Men without Art 164; qtd. in Dasenbrock) In Tarr, the characters' reality manifests itself on the visual surface of things (cf. Kush 75-78). Appearances are manifestations of interiority, which is not itself ex- plored. Kreisler's painfully enraged reaction to seeing Anastasya with Soltyk at the Café Berne, for example, is rendered as a fauvist canvas, that is, as a brightly colorful ornamental pattern: 26 Bertha considers Anastasya an "unnatural [...] poseuse" and a rival (183, 293), while Anas- tasya finds Bertha plainly "not interesting" (301) and speaks of her as a "female booby" (297). For a concise analysis of the emotional triangles involved in this character constellation, see Qué- ma 112-14 and Jameson 96-104.</page><page sequence="18">532 Antje Kley He was as conscious of the interior, which he could not see from his place on the street, as though, passing through, he had just found the walls, tables, chairs, painted bright scarlet. He felt he had left a wake of seething agitation in his passage of the Café. Passing the two people inside there had been the affair of a moment, not yet grasped. This experience ap- parently of the past, was still going on. The sense's picture even, was not yet complete. New facts, details were added every moment. He was still passing Anastasya and Soltyk. (122) Throughout the text, rooms similarly function as reified manifestations of the characters inhabiting them. Bertha's place, for example, with its cheap bourgeois- bohemian and richly lifeless interior (cf. 52-55) is to Tarr "the purest distillation of the commonplace" (55), and Kreisler dwells like a "devout recluse" (77) in his "funeral-vault"-like room (cf. Kush 73; Klein 119). As Edwards puts it, "in the universe of Tarr, there is no true Rousseauistic language of the heart; feelings are intense, but their expression involves artifice" (38; cf. Miller 86; Jameson 86). Tarr's possibly only, but surely significant advantage is that he is aware of the fact. The characters in Tarr live in a world of signs: the text shows their minds invaded and constituted by rumors, expectations, stories, discourses, even when they at- tempt to be most authentic. Tarr draws up his course of action in his high-powered conversations with his friends, who serve, as he puts it in a diary entry included in the first chapter, as "a substitute for this defective self" (31), and there are rival versions of central incidents which are worn smooth as their exchange sets the action moving and defines the characters' identity. There is, for example, the rough compromising "stage-kiss" Kreisler plants on Bertha in public, satisfying the "needs of their differ- ent roles" (142-43), an incident witnessed and heard about by different parties; or Kreisler's absurd insistence on a duel with Soltyk, which is narrated several times from the differently limited perspectives of Tarr, Kreisler, and Soltyk, one right af- ter the other. Caught in the whirlwind that precipitates his downfall, Kreisler ex- plains himself to be "a hundred different things; I am as many people as the different types of people I have lived amongst" (256). And in the beginning of the text, Hob- son, another artist-friend, is described through Tarr's perspective as "a crowd": = You could not say he was an individual. = He was a set. He sat there, a cultivated audi- ence. = He had the aplomb and absence of self-consciousness of numbers- of those who know they are not alone. = Tarr was shy and the reverse by turns. He was alone. The in- dividual is rustic. For distinguishing features Hobson possessed a distinguished absence of personality. (29) Tarr's own self conception is from the beginning given shape as an oppositional one. Presented in the preface as one of the author's "showmen" (15), he is the only character who can supposedly live up to the challenge of a discursively con- structed world. At least that is the program he's invested with. In this context, his distinctly Vorticist self-description as a "mummy-case" reveals both his awareness of the artifice involved in self-expression as well as his need for opposition, be- cause taking an anti-Romantic stance involves his openly misogynist description of women as the incarnation of the hatefully vital and natural:27 27 Dasenbrock's explanation of Lewis's "alleged misogyny" as "simply a pessimism about the liberating possibilities of sex" seems lame and reductionist in an otherwise excellent article (51).</page><page sequence="19">"keeping pace with the visual revolution" 533 A complicated image developed in his mind as he stood with her [Bertha]. He was re- membering Schopenhauer. It was of a Chinese puzzle of boxes within boxes, or of insects' discarded envelopes. A woman had in the middle of her a kernel, a sort of very substan- tial astral baby. This baby was apt to swell. She then became all baby. The husk he held was a painted mummy case. He was a mummy case too. Only he contained nothing but innumerable other painted cases inside, smaller and smaller ones. The smallest was not a substantial astral baby, however, or live core, but a painting like the rest. = His kernel was a painting. That was as it should be! (58-59) Tarr's description of his own self-conception is very much informed by a Vorticist visual aesthetics, as the following quotation from Hubertus Gaßner on the con- cept of the vortex shows: Die Kunstwerke und die einzelnen Künstler, die Künstlergruppe und die Großstadt Lon- don-sie alle rotieren, angeordnet in konzentrischen Kreisen, im Inneren des kosmi- schen Wirbelrings. Diese ineinandergeschachtelten Wirbel erinnern an die russischen Puppen in der Puppe, die ein universaler Energiestrom erfaßt und in kreiselnde Drehbe- wegungen versetzt hat. Im Kunstwerk als dem kleinsten, innersten Wirbel ist noch diesel- be Rotationsenergie wirksam und wahrnehmbar, die den kosmischen Energie wirbel [...] kreiseln läßt. [...] [G]anz im Gegensatz zum 'universellen Dynamismus' der italienischen Futuristen explodiert diese energetische Kraft nicht und sie verströmt auch nicht, son- dern sie fügt die Elemente ineinander und schließt sie zusammen. (24) Secondly, Tarr's emphasis on artifice relies on his vilification and strict rejection of everything that is organic and, to him, safely associated with femininity. Tarr pref- erably vents his misogynist disgust on women in situations where he is unable to live up to his own masculinist self-image, for example, when he cannot quite get himself to separate from Bertha and the organic life he associates with her: How foul and wrong this haunting of women is! = They are everywhere! = Confusing, blurring, libelling, with their half-baked, gushing, tawdry presences! It is like a slop of children and the bawling machinery of the inside of life, always and all over our palaces. Their silly flood of cheap illusion comes in between friendships, stagnates complacently around a softened mind. (32) There was only one God, and he was a man. = A woman was a lower form of life. [...] (313-14) Tarr reacts similarly when the self-confident Anastasya, his only intellectual equal, flusters him: "Surrender to a woman was a sort of suicide for an artist" (214). In con- trast to the formally complex high modernist renditions of the perception and psy- chological interiority of a Clarissa Dalloway or a Stephen Dedalus, the characters in Tarr lack substance and depth.28 Many critics have rejected Lewis's work precisely for this reason (e.g. Leavis 53). But, as Miller convincingly argues, "[i]t seems beside the point to judge the 'shortcomings' of Lewis's work according to the evaluative criteria of high modernism, a literary poetics that Lewis had himself explicitly reject- ed" (88). Jameson also claims that Lewis's writing "demands new reading habits, for 28 Levy identifies four correlates of the lack of interior identity in Tarr: (a) "susceptibility to ab- sorption by ambient identities," (b) "discontinuity of selfhood," (c) "multiplicity of selfhood," and (d) "recourse to masks" (48).</page><page sequence="20">534 Antje Kley which we are less and less prepared. Anglo-American modernism has indeed tradi- tionally been dominated by an impressionistic aesthetic, rather than that- external- izing and mechanical- of Lewis's expressionism" (2). An intermediary consider- ation of Lewis's fictional investigations of representation and selfhood demonstrably proves a more adequate approach to his uncommon modernist aesthetics. Tarr is an abrasive, callous, and bellicose text, portraying an abrasive, callous, and bellicose company of people. Significantly, the story does not seem to go anywhere in particular: the Kreisler story ends with his suicide and, after the loss of the narra- tive engine, the Tarr story idles down into a general sense of entrapment and indif- ference. There is no insight, no renewal, the artist does not come into his own in transcending the organic in the sense that Tarr advocates: "Tarr presents its artists as achieving not liberation and order, but dependence and disorder" (Kramer 262). In merely half a page the story is drawn to a close with a summary of the ensuing years which Tarr spends as a pendulum between Bertha- and Anastasya-type wom- en. Several critics have attempted to smooth out the novel's ending. Alistair Davies, for example, suggests that it presents a successful recognition and transcendence of the banal and that Tarr, as a father of three children, realizes his selfhood in becom- ing "a literal source of formation and regeneration" and thus a true creator (117). However, given Tarr's explicitly anti-organic program as well as his overall too close relation to Kreisler, Davies's conclusion cannot convince. Kush's reading of the nov- el's ending as a successful balancing of "personal desires with social pressures" (75) similarly ignores textual discrepancies. While the protagonist Tarr strives for control and mastery of the self's multiplicity, if not for a unified and detached artistic identi- ty, the text Tarr as a whole reveals the protagonist's project as intangible and brand- marks the rational dream of control as misguided. This reading aligns well with Qué- ma's contention that "Lewis fails to create in fictive terms the vision of philosophical totality and stability to which his non-fictional texts aspire" (82, my emphasis; cf. also Jameson 101-02; Kush 85). This "failure" indicates the degree to which that vi- sion of philosophical totality and critical detachment remains an illusory one. The social and psychological reality of Tarr is generated and advanced within the scope of an anti-organicist economy of discursive exchange. Without under- mining the formal conventions of fiction nearly as radically as Ulysses, Tarr pre- sents a new vision of our being in the world which, in contrast to high modernist fiction, is much less given to a precise mimetic recording of individual conscious- ness.29 In this respect, Lewis's Tarr is a novelistic assault on English individualism and presents a powerful image of how the modern city's proliferating options pro- foundly alter our conceptions of the self. "Act so that there is no use in a center" Lewis's Vorticist novel Tarr and Stein's Cubist (and in that, she thought, quintes- sentially American) Tender Buttons present unique attempts to 'keep pace with the 29 For an account of the high modernist tendency "to mistake images for the things and people they represent," see Armstrong 244-77 and Pitchford 653-65.</page><page sequence="21">"keeping pace with the visual revolution" 535 visual revolution' at the beginning of the twentieth century. Both texts work against the grain of nineteenth century representational aesthetics as well as against a more refined modernist realism in order to comment adequately on a world in which "the continuity" had snapped. Rather than pursuing individual truth or the primary real- ity of self and object "on the other side of images," as Armstrong (244) and Pitchford (653-65) argue the high modernism of Woolf, Joyce, and Lawrence does, they both deal with surfaces and with what their artifice reveals about the world around them. Steins' and Lewis's texts are very different in their playful respectively agonized tone as well as in relation to issues of gender.30 Both, however, are early attempts to articulate the discontinuities of experience as well as the dissolving of solid concep- tions of identity and mastery. For this reason Tarr and Tender Buttons must be seen as writings ahead of their time. Their exhibition of the constitutive dependence be- tween the artifice of their medium and the world around them is unparalleled at the time except in painting. Berry, for example, argues that "Stein approached the mod- ern from a direction which has come to be viewed as postmodern" (1, 1-35; cf. also Schmitz). Similarly, Peppis reasons that Tarr diagnoses the allure and persistent ap- peal of national determinism and English individualism as promising coherence, or- der and control; but in "revealing these efforts at containment and explanation" as "doomed to fail," the novel "anticipates much later 'deconstructions'" of such cate- gories as individuality and nationality (160). While Stein's and Lewis's work went against the dominant grain of high literary modernism, it enabled and significantly diversified the modernist tradition on both sides of the Atlantic, and it has anticipat- ed much of what is perceived to be postmodern today (cf. Pitchford 653-65). An in- termediary analysis of Tender Buttons and Tarr does not only underline the hetero- geneity of modernist literature frequently obscured by processes of canon formation and their critical construction of a particular modernist literary style. It also helps to articulate the historical continuities between modernism and postmod- ernism, particularly in respect to a discussion of identity formation. 30 For a recent discussion of Stein's lesbian modernism and its recovery of desire, see McCabe.
