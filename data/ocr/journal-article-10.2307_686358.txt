The des- cription and explanation of the activities which contribute to this end belong to the context of discovery. Among the important activities of this process is that of introducing concepts into the vocabulary of the scientist. As the ultimate aim is that of stating laws, the only concepts worthy of introduction are those which serve as means to this end. Or, in other words, among the products of the scientist's activities will be significant concepts, concepts which (the scientist believes) enter into statements of law. Furthermore, these products, significant concepts, are explicitly defined. Or, at least, so the definitionalist maintains. I do not propose to defend the definitionalist's thesis in this paper.1 I shall assume that the language of the scientist contains only (I) undefined and directly interpreted predicates, and (2) predicates explicitly defined on the basis of these.2 In particular, I shall assume that all those terms which are, as one says, 'operationally defined' are predicates which are explicitly defined. This means that such concepts as 'length', 'weight', 'soluble', 'kinetic energy', 'heat', etc., all gain their meaning by virtue of chains of definitions which 'hook' these concepts to the observational base, to the undefined and directly interpreted terms. In addition it means that all such concepts are, in principle, eliminable. For, the only condition a * Received I4.vii.67 1 For such a defence, see G.

See G. Bergmann, 'Sense and Nonsense in Operationism', Scientific Monthly, 79 (1954), 210-15; reprinted in P. Frank (ed.), The Validation of Scientific Theories (Boston, 1957). Besides these exceptions, there remains disagreement with respect to the two points (I) and (2). The present paper is in part an attempt to remove this disagreement, specifically in favour of (i) and (2). For some other aspects of the defence, see M.

Since these non-primitive predicates are all based on stipulations, they are, to that extent, arbitrary. The process of introducing them is not arbitrary, however. For, though the scientist can define words as he pleases, since he is a scientist and therefore (qua scientist) only interested in stating laws, he is pleased with only such defined terms as are significant, i.e. as occur in statements of law. Another assumption which I shall make in this paper is that the basic sense of 'if-then' in terms of which these 'operationally defined' concepts are introduced is that of the material conditional. In other words, I shall assume that, for example, (D) 'x is put in water D x dissolves' suffices for analysing 'x is soluble'. To be sure, this has been challenged. But the challenge can be met, I believe, by pointing to the laws which render (D) significant. For example, there is the lawthat sugar is soluble, i.e.the law that (x)[x is sugar D (x is put in water D x dissolves)] I shall assume that this belief is justified, that the fact that (D) is signifi- cant enables one to meet the criticism levelled against it as an analysis of 'soluble'.' The definitionalist's thesis has been challenged by the defenders of 'reduction sentences' so-called. Instead of 'x is soluble' being short for (D), it is, we are told, 'introduced' by the reduction sentence (R) (x)[x is put in water D (x is soluble - x dissolves)] In (R), both 'x is put in water' and 'x dissolves' are already assigned mean- ings. The predicate 'x is soluble' 'introduced' by (R) is undefined and not assigned a rule which interprets it directly; rather, its 'meaning' is given to it by virtue of its occurring in (R).2 Thus, the concepts which the de- finitionalist maintains are assigned meaning by definition chains, the defenders of (R) claim are assigned meaning by chains of reduction sentences. The scientist engages in activities of introducing concepts. The pro- ducts of these activities are the concepts of his language. To speak of these products is to restrict oneself to the contextofjustification. The definitionalist's is, of course, a thesis about these products; it is a thesis about the logic of the concepts introduced. In contrast, the thesis that scientists are 1 Cf. J.

Taking it to be such, the idea of reduction sen- tences is, I believe, mistaken. At least, so I have argued in detail else- where.2 Indeed, I have argued that the plausibility of reduction sentences arises from a confusion on the part of their defenders; that it arises from a confused desire to have the context of justification (i.e. logic) reflect the context of discovery (i.e. psychology).3 I shall assume that these arguments and diagnosis are correct, and shall but merely summarise them in section I of the present paper. To speak of the logic of concepts is to speak of the context of justification. The process which has these concepts as its products is quite another thing. Even though every term in the product is explicitly defined, according to the definitionalist, it does not follow that the definitionalist must say that there is nothing in the process leading to these products which looks like reduction sentences. This paper proposes to show that, even though reduction sentences occur nowhere in the analysis of the products of the scientist's activities, there remain features of the context of discovery, of the process leading to the explicitly defined terms, which bear significant similarities to what have been called reduction sentences. If I succeed in showing this, then the definitionalist's case will thereby be much strengthened. It will be strengthened in two ways. (i) Assume the appeal to reduction sentences is in fact motivated by a certain desire, namely, the desire to have the context of justification reflect that of dis- covery. If it can be shown that in some obvious sense reduction sentences (or something like them) have a place in the latter, the definitionalist will have located another reason why the motivating desire should lead one to suppose reduction sentences would occur in the context of justification. (2) By analysing the processes of the context of discovery within the framework of the definitionalist's thesis, certain standard supposed counter-examples to that thesis will have been shown not to constitute counter-examples after all. Thus, the present paper is both diagnostic and expository: it diagnoses some of the source of the reduction sentence idea; and it indicates how 1 To be sure, it is a trival thesis; but trivial or not, it is still a psychological thesis. 2 See 'The Notion of Logical Necessity in the Later Philosophy of Rudolph Carnap', chapter 4, in A.

I The reduction sentence analysis is, briefly, as follows. Suppose 'PI' and 'P2' are predicates which have already been assigned meaning. Suppose the undefined predicate 'Q' is to be introduced. This is done by the reduction sentence (I.) (x)[Px (Qx - P x)] Suppose, for some individual a that '- PIa' is true. Then 'Qa' can neither be affirmed nor be denied. There is thus an area of 'indeterminacy' in the meaning which (i.i) assigns to 'Q'; 'Q' remains meaningless, i.e. undeter- mined in meaning, for that portion of the universe of discourse for which the antecedent test conditions are not fulfilled. If one now wished to reduce this area of 'indeterminacy of meaning', one could add a further reduction sentence for 'Q': (1.2) (x)[PVsx (Qx - P4x)] However, (1.2) cannot be taken as a mere additional stipulation. For (i.1) and (1.2) together entail a synthetic generality (statement of law) which does not contain 'Q', namely, (I.3) (x)[(Pix . Px) a (P4x - Pax)] This means that before (1i .2) can be added to reduce the number of meaning- less sentences involving 'Q', that is, before it can be added to reduce the area of 'indeterminacy of meaning' of 'Q', one must first establish that (I.3) is true. As our knowledge increases further reduction sentences will be added until there is no 'indeterminacy of meaning' remaining. Every individual in the universe will satisfy the antecedent test conditions of one or more of the reduction sentences for the concept (though, of course, not necessarily the condition mentioned in the consequents). At this point, no indeter- minacy would remain, and one could replace the reduced concept by an explicit definition. This is easily seen. Suppose that (i.i) and (1.2) succeeded in completely removing the 'indeterminacy of meaning' of the term 'Q' which they serve to 'introduce'. In that case every individual in the universe will satisfy one or the other or both of the antecedent test conditions; i.e. (i.4) (x)[Plx v Psx] will be true. But (I.I), (1.2) and (1.4) jointly entail (1.5) (x)[Qx - ((PVx D P2x) . (P3x D P4x))]</page><page sequence="5">Definition and Discovery 291 In the light of (I.5) one can suggest that (I.I) and (1.2) be replaced by an explicit definition for 'Q', namely, (1.6) 'Qx' is short for '(Pix D Pax) . (Pxz D P4x)' Then (1.5) would be true by definition, and would contain no uninter- preted term. This would serve to make explicit the purely conventional parts of (i.i), (1.2) and (1.4), and to separate these from the factual content embodied in (I.3) and (i.4)?1 Suppose the original reduced predicate '9' were part of further reduction sentences: for example, it might occur in the reduction sentence (i.7) (x)[Qx D (Rx Sx)] for 'R'. Then (i.5) would enable one to replace the reduced 'Q' by the predicate explicitly defined by (I.5). And so on, for all other contexts containing the original reduced 'Q'.2 And this, it is suggested,3 reflects the actual growth of science. Accept- able scientific concepts have an 'openness of meaning' which enable them to serve as 'crystallisation points' for the growth of scientific knowledge.4 Reduction sentences show how this is possible (so it is claimed) because their logic provides an 'openness of meaning' such that, as new laws are discovered (as, e.g. (i.3)), the scientist can add further criteria (indicators) for applying the concept, these further criteria being laid down in additional reduction sentences (such as (1.2)). Furthermore, their logic shows that, with the growth of knowledge, and the addition of new indicators, the 'meaning' of a concept gradually increases until such a time as it is com- pletely determined. At that time the scientist will give us an explicit definition of it. But (it is suggested) it is unreasonable to ask for an explicit definition (as the definitionalists do) until knowledge of laws has increased to the point where this is possible. There are three decisive objections to the veryidea of a reduction sentence (in the context of justification). The first is the most crucial; the other two depend upon it. One. The predicates 'introduced' by reduction sentences are literally meaningless, since they are undefined predicates yet are not assigned a rule of interpretation.5 1 One wants to suggest that a concept is completely defined in case that all individuals are testable, rather than tested. That is, it would seem that the truth of (I.4) is not a necessary condition for a term having its meaning completely determined. This difficulty can be by-passed if the defender of reduction sentences changes the 'if-then' which occurs in them from that of the material conditional to a stronger one which supports the sub- junctive conditional that 'testable' requires. 2 Cf.

I I.</page><page sequence="6">292 Fred Wilson Two. It follows that the syntax-semantics distinction is blurred. Unlike explicit definitions, which are purely syntactical, placing no limitations on how rules of interpretation are assigned to the undefined primitives, reduction sentences are supposed to be stipulations and yet still place restrictions upon how one may interpret the undefined predicates. For, (i.i) requires that no rule of interpretation be assigned to the predicate 'Q' which it introduces. Three. Consider an individual a for which the meaning of 'Q' is not yet 'determined' by reduction sentences. Then 'Qa' is syntactically a sentence but is neither true nor false. This means that the customary 'truth-table' techniques cannot be used to explicate the analytic-synthetic distinction, since their use depends upon having the semantics of the language such that every string which is syntactically a sentence is either true or false and not both. As these techniques provide the only known basis for expli- cating the distinction, it follows that a language in which terms are 'intro- duced' by reduction sentences cannot explicate the dichotomy between matters of fact and matters of logic.1 It is claimed that 'introducing' terms by reduction rather than by explicit definition has the following advantage. In science, acceptable terms are those which serve as 'crystallisation points' for scientific dis- covery, for the growth of scientific knowledge. Explicit definition cannot, while reduction can, account for this. For, the meaning of explicitly defined terms is settled once for all, while the meaning of reduced terms can be increased (by adding more reduction sentences) as scientific knowledge increases (through the discovery of laws such as (I .3)). Thus, it is said, reduction does, while explicit definition does not, reflect accurately what goes on in the practice of science. That terms 'introduced' by reduction sentences have an 'openness of meaning' in the relevant sense cannot be denied. (Indeed, that is precisely why they are to be rejected; this 'openness of meaning' requires that the predicate introduced be meaningless (undefined and uninterpreted).) However, the above argument does not establish that this is an advantage over explicit definition. For the argument rests upon a confusion: it supposes that logic must reflect the order of discovery. Our logical analyses of the concepts the scientist introduces belong to the context of justification. There is no reason whatsoever why these analyses should reflect the order in which the scientist discovered the laws which make them significant, and therefore acceptable to the scientist. For logic is one thing, discovery another.2 ' Carnap claims otherwise in his 'Testability and Meaning', but I have shown this claim to be false in my study, 'The Notion of Logical Necessity in the Later Philosophy of Rudolph Carnap'; see ch. 4, sec. (4.1). 2 Cf. N. Goodman, Fact, Fiction, and Forecast, p. 47.</page><page sequence="7">Definition and Discovery 293 Furthermore, given the distinction between logic and discovery, it is clear that the definitionalist can account for the fact that concepts acceptable to the scientist have an 'openness of meaning' in the sense that they serve as 'crystallisation points' for the development of scientific knowledge (knowledge of laws). Terms which have an 'openness of meaning' in this sense are simply those which are discovered to be significant. And the scientist finds acceptable only such concepts as are significant. Which gives the definitionalist all he needs against the cited argument in favour of reduction sentences. The confusion of logic and sociology-psychology on which rests the argument defending reduction sentences, is plausible only if one confuses two kinds of justification. First, there is the justification which the scientist gives when he shows a certain activity (introducing concepts) has as its product the end toward which the activity was directed (a significant concept). Second, there is the justification which shows that the product (a defined concept) satisfies the canons of logic (it must be eliminable in all contexts) and is as the first justification requires it to be (the laws which make the product, the defined concept, significant, are reasonably con- firmed). Justification of the first sort is a matter of the psychology of scientists; justification of the second sort is a matter of logic. And these are two things and not one. II Suppose we have the definition (2.I) 'Gx' is short for 'Fix . F2x' The two sentences (2.2) (x)[Gx F x] and (2.3) (x)[Gx Fax] are, of course, both synthetic, though (2.4) (x)[Gx = (Fx . F x)] may, by virtue of (2.1), be treated as if it were analytic.1 Assume that we already know that (2.2) and (2.3) are true. That means we also know that (2.5) (x)[Fix = Fax] is true. Suppose, now, that we discover the generalisation (2.6) (x)[F2x - F3x] ' It is not literally analytic, for it is not true by virtue of its (syntactical) form alone. But it may be treated as if it were analytic, since the elimination of defined terms produces a sentence which is true by virtue of its form alone. Cf. F. Wilson, 'Implicit Definition Once Again', The Journal of Philosophy, 6o (I965), 364-74.</page><page sequence="8">294 Fred Wilson to be true. (2.6) together with (2.5) and the definition (2.1) entails (2.7) (x)[Gx F zx] This in turn entails (2.8) (x)[(Gx . Fax) Fax] If one now defined (2.9) 'G*x' is short for 'Fix. Fzx . F3x' one could obtain by deduction from (2.2) and (2.6) the generalisation (2.IO) (x)[G*x = F x] (2.IO) would be known to be true, since it is validly deduced from premisses known to be true. From (2.3) and (2.6) and using (2.9) one would also de- duce (2.11) (x)[G*x = F2x] Finally, (2.8) and (2.9) give (2.12) (x)[G*x = F3x] (2.o10), (2.11), and (2.12) are, of course, all synthetic. What is noteworthy in this transition is the crucial role of (2.6). The definition (2.9) is possible at any time. Definitions are arbitrary, in the sense that the only condition which logic imposes upon them is that the term defined be eliminable wherever it occurs. So logic permits (2.9) to be laid down at any time. But unless (2.6) were (known to be) true this stipulation would be pointless. For it is the fact that (2.6) is (known to be) true that enables one to obtain the law statements (2.10), (2.11) and (2.12). The scientist desires to introduce only significant concepts, that is, to define only such terms as enter into statements of law. Unless (2.Io), (2.I I1) and (2.12) were true, the definition (2.9) would not satisfy the condi- tion of significance the scientist's desires impose on definitions. And (2.10), (2.II) and (2.I2) can be affirmed only because (2.6) is (known to be) true. Thus, the discovery of (2.6) is a necessary condition which must be fulfilled before the scientist can define 'G*x' by (2.9) as a means to his desired end. Having defined 'G*x' by means of (2.9), as a consequence of the dis- covery of (2.6) which renders it significant, the scientist could then abandon the term 'Gx'.' For, suppose the laws (2.2), (2.3) and (2.5) alone are those which render 'Gx' significant. These are deducible from (2.Io), (2.1I) and 1 'Could abandon' but not necessarily 'would abandon'. The scientist might have reasons for retaining it. See below.</page><page sequence="9">Definition and Discovery 295 (2.12). In addition, from these three (2.6) is also deducible. On the other hand, the latter is not deducible from (2.2) and (2.3). Other things being equal, it is, clearly, both more elegant and more convenient to express what one knows after the discovery of (2.6) in terms of 'G*x' rather than 'Gx'. For this reason, if the scientist has no definite reason for retaining 'Gx' in his vocabulary, the definite tendency will be for him to abandon it, letting 'G*x' replace it. It must, of course, be emphasised that the gain is one of convenience and elegance only. Factual content is not increased. (How could it be by a mere redefinition of concepts?) Nor can one fail to state (2.I0)-(2.I2). There is no possibility for the elimination of the law statements; a state- ment true by definition cannot replace a statement of law. (The concept 'G*x', since it is a defined term, cannot by itself or in a statement true by virtue of its definition say anything at all about facts.') However, con- venience and elegance count, and when the scientist comes (say) to rewrite his textbook, he will probably add a new indicator, redefine his concepts. The above is quite schematic. But not, I think, unrealistic in essentials. One point of unrealism however, is crucial. The scientist would not mark his two defined concepts as 'Gx' and 'G*x'. On the contrary, he would simply redefine the same mark. At the end of the process, after the dis- covery of (2.6), 'Gx' would be defined as short for 'Fix . Fx . F3x'. Logically, this presents no problem whatsoever. Nor is it unreasonable to describe the process as one in which new 'indicators' are added to a concept in the light of the discovery of the truth of a justificatory synthetic general- ity. However, if one concentrated on this process (the context of discovery) rather than on the product of this process, viz. definition (2.9) (the context of justification), then one might well be (mis)led into believing that the scientist was employing reduction sentences. This point can be made even more evident from the following considera- tions. (2.2) and (2.3) entail (2.13) (x)[Flx - (Gx - F x)]* (2.13) has the logical form of a reduction sentence. (However, it is not in fact a reduction sentence. For 'Gx' is explicitly defined by (2.i). If (2.i3) 1 It has been wrongly held by some, notably Hegel and Dewey, that a statement true by definition can do the job of a statement of fact. For a discussion and critique of the general pattern, see G. Bergmann, Philosophy of Science (Madison, Wisc., 1958), pp. 62 ff. and 79 ff. For Dewey in particular, see M. Brodbeck, 'The New Rationalism: Dewey's Theory of Induction', The Journal of Philosophy, 46 (1949), 781-91. (2.13) is entailed by (2.3) alone without the assistance of (2.2). But this is by virtue of the 'pecularities' of the material conditional alone. The addition of (2.2) established that the connection between F1 and the other predicates is 'non-accidental', as it were. It pro- vides the 'connection' that the material conditional alone does not provide.</page><page sequence="10">296 Fred Wilson were what Carnap and Hempel call a reduction sentence, then 'Gx' would not be a defined predicate.) Furthermore, (2.6) entails (2.14) (x)[F x - (Fx - F x)] Within the reduction sentence framework, (2.14) would constitute sufficient justification for introducing a second 'reduction sentence': (2.15) (x)[F x D (Gx - Fax)] [That is, (2.14) plays the role that is played by (1.3).] (2.15), too, has the form of a reduction sentence. (Though, again, it too is not literally one.) Furthermore, (2.15) also occurs in the scientist's scheme, being entailed by (2.2) and (2.7).1 The point is that (2.7), which entails the second 'reduction sentence' (2.15), is affirmable only after the discovery of the truth of (2.6); that is, it is affirmable only after the dis- covery of the truth of the sentence which entails (2.14), where (2.14) is the sentence which would justify (2.15) if (2.15) were a reduction sentence. Thus, all the materials for reduction sentences are present. One should not, therefore, be surprised that someone who blurs the distinction be- tween the process of discovery and the products of that process, should end up defending reduction sentences. Nor is this the only feature of the context of discovery which could lead one to reduction sentences. But before indicating these other features, it should be pointed out that not always upon the discovery of a law like (2.6) does the scientist revise his set of definitions (as from (2.1) to (2.9)). The question, to state it in terms of our example, is this: Under what conditions would one, and would one not, upon the discovery of (2.6) that 'Gx' and 'Fax' are coextensive, redefine 'Gx' so that 'Fax' now occurs in its definiens where previously it did not? Now, the answer to the first part, about the conditions under which one would redefine the term, has already been answered a few paragraphs back. The answer, roughly, is that one would redefine when he had no motive for not redefining. For, other things being equal, the new concept is more significant than the old. More accurately, it can be used to state the same laws as the old concept, plus additional ones. And, as the scientist's desire is for significant concepts, this makes the new term more appropriate for his end than the old. On the other hand, things are not always equal. The basic desire of the scientist is (by definition) the statement of laws. Secondarily, he wants these laws to fit together into a theory. A theory is a set of laws arranged into an axiomatic system.2 A law may or may not occupy 1 See n. 2, p. 295. 2 Cf. H. Hochberg, 'Axiomatic Systems, Formalization, and Scientific Theories', in L. Gross (ed.), Symposium on Sociological Theory (New York, 1959).</page><page sequence="11">Definition and Discovery 297 a crucial place in this structure. To abandon one lawas false mayrequire only slight modifications in the structure. To abandon another may have far- reaching effects. Thus, some laws are of great theoretical significance; others are of but minor theoretical significance. Scientists, therefore, desire not only significant concepts, but also concepts which enter into laws of great theoretical significance. Suppose the laws (2.2) and (2.3) were part of a theory. Suppose further that they are of great theoretical significance. Finally, suppose (2.6) is of little theoretical significance. Since (2.Io), (z.i i) and (2.12i) are true only if (2.6) is true, it follows that these statements, like (2.6), but unlike (2.2) and (2.3), embody knowledge which is of little theoretical significance. In such a case, the scientist will not want his theoretical formulations encumbered by the presence of (2.6) and its consequences. It is (2.2) and (2.3) which are crucial; (2.6) can be fit in later, so to speak, as it is of only peripheral interest. Circumstances being thus, the scientist will have good motivation for not redefining 'Gx' so as to include 'F3x' in its definiens. Thus, the answer to the second part of the question asked above, about the conditions under which one would not redefine the term, is this: One would not redefine it upon the discovery of new laws in the case that the new laws are of no theoretical significance, while the laws into which the unredefined concept enters are of some theoretical significance. The following examples illustrate my point. Consider the phrase 'x is magnetic'. We have the two definitions: (2.16) 'x is magnetic,' is short for '(x is near a small iron object) a (the object moves toward x)' (2.17) 'x is magnetic,' is short for '(x is moved through a small iron loop) (an electric current flows in the loop)'" and also the law (2.I8) (x) (x is magnetic, x is magnetic2) This law permits us to introduce the definition (2.19) 'x is magnetic' is short for '(x is magnetic,) . (x is magnetic2)' If one is asked for the definition of 'magnetic' it is not possible to indicate just (2.i6) or just (2.17). Only (2.i9) suffices. For 'magnetic' means both what (2.16) says and what (2.i7) says. However, the only reason we have the concept 'magnetic' defined just as in (2.19) is because we know the law (2.I8). It is (2.18) which establishes that an object's 1 Recall that I am assuming that the appropriate sense of 'if-then' for 'operational de- finitions' is that of the material conditional, supplemented by the condition that the term defined be significant. In this case, it is clear that the significance condition is fulfilled. x</page><page sequence="12">298 Fred Wilson being magnetic1 is sufficient for its being magnetic. Without (2.18), (2.19) would be logically impeccable but quite useless. And, on the other hand, neither the concept defined by (2.16) nor that defined by (2.17) occurs in laws of greater theoretical significance than the other. For these reasons magnetic1 and magnetic, are both properties the presence of which, either separately noted or jointly, suffice to indicate the presence of the property magnetic. Magnetic, and magnetic2 are coextensive, and occur within the theoretical structure of science at exactly the same points; they are, there- fore, equally definitory of what it is to be magnetic.' In contrast, consider the case of defining the concept of being hungry (for food) in behaviour theory. There are several possibilities: (2.20) 'x is hungry1' is short for 'x exhibits stomach contractions' (2.21) 'x is hungry2' is short for 'x has not eaten for such and such a length of time' (2.22) 'x is hungry3' is short for '(x is presented with food) (x con- sumes the food)'. In the case of humans we can add: (2.23) 'x is hungry4' is short for '[(x is in such and such a set). (x is asked "hungry?")] D (x utters "I-am-hungry")' Finally, if we are sophisticated in our physiology, we can supplement (2.20) with (2.24) 'x is hungry5' is short for 'x has such and such an amount of sugar in his blood' We know that all of these concepts are as a matter of fact coextensive. These laws of coextensivity determine that the concept defined by the conjunction of the predicates defined by (2.20)-(2.24) is a significant con- cept. The concept defined by the conjunction of the terms defined by (2.21), (2.22), (2.23) and (perhaps) (2.20) is, I believe, a not unfair analysis of our 'ordinary' concept of being hungry. When we say of a person that he is hungry, we are applying to him all the predicates of this conjunction. To 'explain' what it is to be hungry, it is necessary to indicate each of the properties defined by (2.zo) through (2.23) and also the fact that the properties thus defined are coextensive.2 1 This statement is true, of course, only at the phenomenological level. It does not hold for the concept which applies to the entities in the model of the theory of the structure of matter. The 'operationally defined' terms of the phenomenological level are co-ordinated to certain highly defined model terms. None of the latter is ever directly interpreted. 2 One might note that such 'explanations' are what go by the name of 'conceptual analysis' at Oxford and elsewhere. Conceptual analysis involves noting explicit definitions, on the</page><page sequence="13">Definition and Discovery 299 However, as more and more knowledge of laws has become available and the outlines of a theoretical structure have become apparent, it has become clear that the concepts which belong to the laws of greater actual and (we expect) potential theoretical significance, are the physiological. That means the concepts defined by (2.20) and (2.24) become of greater importance than those defined by (2.21)-(2.23) as the science of psychology develops. This accounts for the tendency (which is not all that new) to take only the physiologically defined concepts as definitory of 'hungry' while the be- haviourally defined concepts, those which occur in laws of lesser theoretical significance, are taken to be merely the 'symptoms' of hunger. We can now partially answer a point made by Madden1 against the definitionalist's thesis. If one explicitly identifies the meanings of 'If a magnetic needle is put close to the wire, it deflects', or whatever, with 'There is an electric current in this wire,' then he is unable to give as a reason why something is what it is, a synonymous phrase . .. if one asks, 'Why did this needle move?', I have not answered him at all if, having asserted the equivalence of needle moving and electric current, I reply, 'because the wire conducts an electric current.' But this is precisely what I want to do. Whenever one sees a magnetic needle held near a wire move, ... he can legitimately say by way of explaining these facts, or giving reasons for their occurrence, 'There is an electric current in this wire.' ... the observational one hand, and laws of nature, on the other. To the extent that these are not distinguished, 'conceptual analysis' is simply confused. Terms conjunctively defined on the basis of a series of other terms which are, as a matter of lawful fact, coextensive, provide (I believe) a reasonable explication of the following remarks of Sellars: '. . . while a term cannot have several explicit definitions without being ambiguous, a term may have several sufficient minimal criteria without being ambiguous, provided that the criteria are satisfied by the same objects. (And even where they are not. This would not mean that the term was ambiguous [his italics], though it would mean that revision of its criteria was called for.)' (W. Sellars, 'Comments on Maxwell's "Meaning Postulates in Scientific Theories" ', in H. Feigl and G. Maxwell (ed.), Current Issues in the Philosophy of Science (New York, 1961), p. 188.) It also explicates, I believe, such notions as Strawson's 'P-predicates'. But to argue that would take me beyond the purposes of the present paper. I might note, finally, that what is said in the present paper with respect to conjunc- tively defined concepts holds only in the case that both test procedures (both conjuncts) apply to all objects in the relevant universe of discourse. This restriction means what is said does not apply to, e.g. temperature, defined once in terms of a mercury thermometer, once in terms of a platinum thermometer. The latter can measure the temperature of objects for which the use of a mercury thermometer is physically impossible; this being so, the two concepts are not, as a matter of fact, coextensive. However, it is possible to handle this case by defining temperature as the disjunction of the two test procedures. This requires, of course, that the two tests yield the same result in those cases where they both apply, that for these cases they be coextensive. The connection between the conjunctive and disjunctive cases can be seen by noting that, if G is coextensive with H, then G v H is coextensive with G. H, and each of these complex predicates is coextensive with each of G and H. 1 E. H. Madden, 'Definition and Reduction', Philosophy of Science, 28 (I961), 390-405.</page><page sequence="14">300 Fred Wilson evidence is explained, in part, at any rate, by the theoretical terms to which it is related and hence could not be an explicit definition of it but rather a criterion for its correct use.1 Let us write 'x is electric' as short for 'there is an electric current flowing in x'. This is merely for our own convenience. Madden mentions the definition (2.25) 'x is electric1' is short for '(x is put close to a magnetic needle)D (the needle deflects)' This shows that he is concerned, primarily, with the phenomenological level, the level of 'operational definitions'. What must be noted is that (2.25) gives only part of the meaning of the operationally defined concept 'x is electric'. We also have, for example, (2.26) 'x is electric2' is short for '(a resistance coil is connected into x) (the coil heats up)' and (2.27) 'x is electric3' is short for '(x is put in such and such a solution)D (so and so precipitates)' Certain true generalities establish that the concepts defined by (2.25), (2.26) and (2.27) are coextensive. These laws justify the definition of 'x is electric' as the conjunction of the predicates defined by (2.25)-(2.26). For, it is these laws which guarantee that the thus defined 'x is electric' is a significant concept.2 Now, I may stipulate a special meaning for 'x is electric'. That is my privilege, if I choose to exercise it. I may stipulate, for example, with Madden, that 'x is electric' is synonymous with 'x is electric1', where the latter is as defined by (2.25). Then Madden's comment is surely not beside the point: I cannot appeal to something's being electric to explain why, when a magnetic needle is put close to it, the needle deflects.3 But the definitionalist's is not a thesis about his own concepts, but about the scientist's. And the scientist's concept of 'electric' involves (2.26) and (2.27). And, moreover, it involves these by virtue of certain laws. 1 E. H. Madden, 'Definition and Reduction', pp. 398-9. 2 (2.25) contains 'magnetic' in the definiens. Similarly (2.17) contains 'electric' in its definiens. 'Electric' and 'magnetic' enter in each other's definition. This shows that as one moves up the definitional chains away from the observational base concepts become definitionally interconnected. There come to exist 'conceptual connections' among the more highly defined concepts. But, because there are definitional connections, they are absolutely trivial. What is important are the laws among the less highly defined concepts. These laws render the more highly defined terms significant, and justify their intro- duction. 3 'Not beside the point' would perhaps be better as 'not completely beside the point'. I shall suggest below that even here Madden misses the mark to a certain extent.</page><page sequence="15">Definition and Discovery 301 As Madden says, we want to be able to explain the deflection of the magnetic needle by pointing to the fact that the wire is electric. We want to be able to do this because this is what the scientist does. The piece of commonsense, that this practice of the scientist is (at times) justified,1 must be accounted for by the definitionalist. If he cannot, then his thesis is inadequate, just as Madden suggests. But, Madden notwithstanding, the definitionalist can account for this piece of commonsense. He merely points out that to say something is electric is to say more than that it is electric1: it is to say also that it is electric2 and that it is electric3; and moreover, since the concept of being electric is appealed to by the scientist, who, by definition, uses none but significant concepts, it is also to refer (implicitly, at least, or, as one might put it, enthymematically) to certain laws, namely, those which justify the scientist's use of the concept electric. That is, when the scientist explains by citing a concept there is also an implicit appeal to certain laws; in the present example, it could be to (at least) those laws which state that electric1, electric2 and electric3 are coextensive concepts. There is an implicit appeal to those laws which show that the predicates occurring in the definiens of concept cited, are not brought together by mere whim, but are, rather, lawfully connected. The concept of being electric is defined, to be sure. But it is significant. It is this fact of significance which provides the explanatory power behind the scientist's citing the electric current as a reason for the deflection of the needle. I also want to say that even Madden's objection to the use of electricl as explanatory is not completely correct. Electricl, even as defined by (2.25), provides some explanation of why the needle deflects. If the concept defined by (2.25) is to be of interest to the scientist, then (2.25) cannot be an arbitrary stipulation; rather, it must be a stipulation defining a significant concept, and, to that extent, non-arbitrary. That means that in addition to the linguistic connection between antecedent and consequent of the definiens in (2.25) which the stipulation (2.25) establishes, there is also a lawful connection. These laws provide a non-linguistic connection which justifies defining the concept electric,. Citing the wire's being electric1 as an explanation of the needle's deflection is explanatory 1 This point can be much generalised. Much has been made recently of historical ex- planations in which none but a concept is mentioned. This does not affect the 'covering law model' of explanation. The defender of that 'model' needs merely to point to the laws which make the concept appealed to a significant concept; that is, point to the laws which account for the presence of that concept in our vocabulary. Of course, the 'laws' may be of a very imperfect sort, and even false but believed for ideological reasons. That is not the point. The point is that these laws (or what are believed to be laws) give the concept its explanatory power (what is felt to be its explanatory power). See M. Brodbeck, 'Explanation, Prediction, and "Imperfect" Knowledge', in H. Feigl and G. Maxwell (eds.), Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, vol. iii (Minneapolis, 1962).</page><page sequence="16">302 Fred Wilson in so far as there is an implicit reference to this non-arbitrary, significant connection among concepts which serves as justification for the stipulation (2.25). Not that this explanatory power is very great. It is not. But it is there nonetheless. It provides, I suggest, the non-anthropomorphic and common- sense core of the scholastic and Rylean idea that citing a disposition serves to explain why certain objects do certain things in certain circumstances.' And, I should point out, such explanatory power increases as one moves up the definitional chains to the more highly defined concepts of the hierarchy. Pointing to something's being electric has more explanatory power than pointing to its being electric,. For, more generalities must be true before 'electric' is significant than before 'electric1' is significant. Thus far, we have stayed, as Madden suggests, at the level of 'opera- tional definitions'. But we might also note that within the model of the theory of the structure of matter, one finds yet another definition of the concept electric. Call this concept 'electricm'. This is defined within the model in terms of electron flow, etc. 'Electricm' is not operationally defined; it does not occur at the phenomenological level. The theory does, however, co-ordinate this concept to that of 'electric', as operationally defined. This co-ordination is such that there is an electricm current flowing if an only if there is an electric current flowing.2 This accounts for the fact that, as science has grown, concepts of the model have come to be part of the definition (meaning) of electric. This is analogous to the trend to include physiological factors as part of the definition of hungry. And, indeed, for the practicing physicist, electricm becomes the defining characteristic of being electric. It does this by virtue of fact that electricm occurs in laws of high theoretical significance within the total structure of physics. Electric, electric2, and electric3 are quite peripheral compared to electricm. It is, moreover, this high theoretical significance of the laws in which it occurs that gives the citation of electricm its high explanatory power. This, however, is a digression (though it helps to explain why Madden's points should seem prima facie plausible). Return to the phenomenological level; to the 'electric' operationally defined as the conjunction of the pre- dicates defined by (2.25)-(2.27). I agree with Madden that 'the observational evidence is explained, in part, at any rate, by the theoretical terms to which it is related'. That is, one can explain why a wire deflects a magnetic needle by pointing to the 1 For a discussion of Ryle, see the study of L. Addis, 'Ryle's Ontology of Mind', in L. Addis and D.

Bergmann, 'Reduction', in Current Trends in Psychology and the Behavioural Sciences (Pittsburgh, I955).</page><page sequence="17">Definition and Discovery 303 fact that the wire is electric (or even: electric1). But, I say against Madden, it does not follow that 'hence [the observational evidence] could not be an explicit definition of [the theoretical term]'. This follows only if the sole condition a definition needs to fulfil is that it be eliminable. If this were the sole condition then the theoretical term would be a mere abbreviation of the observational evidence, and so no explanation of it. To be sure, elimin- ability is the only condition that logic imposes. But the scientist desires to define only significant concepts. His desires impose a further condition besides eliminability: significance. This further condition insures that any theoretical term which is acceptable to the scientist, even though it may be explicitly defined in terms of the observational evidence, is not a mere abbreviation of the latter. And this fact that it is not a mere abbreviation, that it is also significant, accounts for the explanatory power of scien- tifically acceptable defined terms. (to be concluded)</page></plain_text>
