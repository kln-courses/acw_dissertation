Pp. 5-49. 38 x 28 cm. If, in the words of Professor Flinders Petrie, pottery "constitutes the essential " alphabet of archeeology in every land," the author of this beautiful treatise on the pottery of the North-west of the Argentine Republic deserves the gr.titude of every student of South American antiquities. The work is in every respect creditable to the institution which has made possible its publication in so handsome a form, the printing is excellent, the numerous coloured plates of great beauty, and the work of Professor Outes amply testifies to the adequacy of the language of Cervantes as a medium for the expression of scientific thought. The material on which the work is based is, for the most part, preserved in the National Museum at La Plata; much of it was collected by Methfessel and Ambrosetti in the provinces of Catamarca and Tucuman, whilst many of the examples described form part of the collection of Senior S. A. Lafone Quevedo. It is unfortunate that so many of the specimens lack definite antecedents-that they should be, in fact, " drift " material. The derivation of many examples is highly [ 76 ]</page><page sequence="2">1909.] MAN. [No. 48. doubtful, and in comparatively few instances is any record available as to the precise locality, circumstances of discovery and associated artifacts. This is the more to be regretted since precise information of this character is sorely needed at the present day in order to advance the science in all parts of South America. Fully appreciating this difficulty, the author has generally resisted all temptation to theorise, limiting his work to a careful examination and detailed description of each specimen, only allowing his views on the wider aspects of the subject to appear in the brief but extremely interesting Observaciones appended to every chapter. Broadly grouping his material into "vessels for domestic use" and "'funerary urns," the author has subdivided the pottery according to form and character of its decoration. Dealing first of all with an interesting class covered with designs of textile derivation painted in red, white, and black, which he considers to be of archaic type, he proceeds to describe pots painted in red and black and the very characteristic " footless vases " (vasos apodos) bearing zoomorphic and occasionally phytomorphic patterns. Among the former, a serpent having a head at each extremity of the body, the Rhea and a batrachian are commonly presented in a somewhat conventionalised style. The urns of yellow clay, painted with strangely schematic anthropomorphic designs in black, are especially interesting, and doubtless could tell us much of primitive relig,ion if we knew their secret. The peculiar little boss, or projection, not infrequently moulded into the shape of an animal's head, usually to be noted on " footless vases," is explained in a satisfactory manner by reference to a quaint little " portrait pot " from Pachacamac, and is shown to be a point of support for the rope which bound the vessel to the shoulders of the bearer. The wide diffusion of these "footless vases" is commented lupon, for they range far afield from the Peruvian culture centre supposed to be their place of origin. One inotes the rarity of incised ornamentation, the crude beginnings of moulding in relief, and entire absence of elaborate double and triple pots, such as are common in the Peruvian coast region and in Ecuador. Professor Outes very rightly, in the presenit writer's opinion, deprecates the unfortunate tendency which has at times arisen to describe the pottery of the New World in terms derived from the archbeology of the Mediterranean region. In the present very imperfect condition of our knowledge of South American technical development it would seem preferable to avoid the use of all descriptive expressions which by reason of their classical associations tend to confuse the milnd, and from this, perhaps, extreme point of view it may even be regretted that such words as " climankistron " and "a nkistron " have been made use of in the work under con- sidei'ation. Apart from this mild criticism, nothing but praise can be given to this admirable contribution to the study of Man in America. One seeks in vain, it is true, for information on the chemical nature of the pig- ments employed in the decoration, buit it may be presumed that powdered heematite and oxide of manganese, as determined by the present writer in certain Chilian examples, furnished the palette of the Indian artist. Trhe pigments, the method of building the pottery, and means by 'which such excellent baking was secured, will, however, doubtless be fully dealt with in the important work now in course of preparation by the author, Sobre la Evolucion de las Artes plasticas entre los primitivos habitantes de la Republica Argentina. However impressed he may be by the thoroughness of the work under considera- tion, the reader cannot fail to be struck with the backward state of South American archebology. As yet no " corpus " of Argentine or Chilian pottery exists, nor is such an aid to study likely to be available for many years to come. So predominant has been the interest of Peruviani culture that the wider field stretching afar' beyond the widest bounds attributed by enthusiasts to the " Inca Empire " has suffered neglect.

Thanks to scientific excavation in Peru we begin to see that the past was even more wonderful than the picture drawn of it by Garcilasso, and who can doubt that a rich harvest of knowledge awaits the investigator amid the broad pampas of the Argentine and quebradas of Chile ?
