<plain_text><page sequence="1">Local-Cosmopolitan Theory and Religiosity Among Catholic Nuns and Brothers* LARRY R. PETERSENt K. PETER TAKAYAMAt Roof's (1972, 1976, 1978) local-cosmopolitan theory of religious commitment is tested using a population of Catholic brothers and nuns living in West Tennessee. The findings provide rather strong support for Roof's theory. Local community reference (localism) had appreciable positive effects on seven religious belief and behavioral variables. Moreover, localism played a role (albeit a limited one) in mediating the effects of education, size of hometown, and length of residence on the religiosity variables. The implications of the findings for the generalizability of the theory are discussed. Roof (1972, 1976, 1978) has recently developed a theory of religious commitment (local- cosmopolitan theory) which is a potentially important contribution to a sociological understanding of sources of individual religiosity. His theory is perhaps more systematic and comprehensive than any existing theory of religious commitment. Moreover, it directs attention to a sociological construct as a source of this commitment which has long been overlooked by students of religion - local community reference. The purpose of this study is to test Roof's theory using a population of Catholic nuns and brothers. Since Roof's major concern lies with the applicability of his theory to members of mainline Protestant groups, testing it among these Catholic professionals should have important implications for determining its generalizability. Drawing on Berger's notion of plausibility structures, Roof (1976, 1978) contends that one must be integrated into networks of individuals who share one's world views if such views are to retain their plausibility. These networks (plausibility structures) confirm or reinforce the individual's definitions of reality ensuring that they remain personally meaningful. In relatively simple, undifferentiated societies, religious and non-religious spheres of life are so inextricably tied that plausibility structures which support traditional religion permeate the entire society. However, as a result of secularization and structural differentiation, religious and nonreligious domains become increasingly disassociated and plausibility structures for religion come to be restricted to smaller, more fragmented social spheres. Roof argues that in modern, secular society one important sphere which continues to serve as a plausibility structure for traditional religion (as well as other forms of traditionality) is the local community. Consequently, local community attachment is seen as a primary source of religious commitment. This attachment is seen to vary on a local-cosmopolitan continuum which assesses the extent to which individuals are oriented toward their immediate social environment *This research was supported, in part, by a grant from the Catholic Diocese of Memphis. tLarry R. Petersen and K. Peter Takayama are professors in sociology at Memphis State University. ?

In contrast, cosmopolitans have their commitments centered outside the residential community and tend to identify more with abstract, generalized groups that may be spatially remote... (Roof, 1978:41)." Relatedly, cosmopolitans possess broader social perspectives (i.e., greater "breadth of perspective") than locals whose social experiences and world views, being rooted in their immediate communities, tend to be narrowly defined and highly traditional. The implications of Roof's local-cosmopolitan distinction for understanding the belonging component of religious commitment (i.e., religious participation) are at least two-fold. First, locals are well-integrated into community-based primary groups that have traditionally supported religious norms (e.g., family, kinship and ethnic groups). Thus, locals are more exposed to and subject to the influence of norms and sanctions which encourage religious participation. Second, local religious organizations offer a setting in which informal, communal relations which are highly valued by locals can be developed. Thus, one would expect religious participation to be greater among locals than among cosmopolitans. The local-cosmopolitan distinction also has implications for the meaning component of religion (i.e., subjective, personal aspects of commitment). Since locals and cosmopolitans have different life-styles and social experiences, they develop different meaning systems and interpretations of social reality. An important difference between the two groups is the extent to which they personalize their interpretations of social experiences. Locals rely heavily on interpersonal norms in interpreting such experiences and thus view them in a highly personalized, concrete manner which is relevant to their own lives. Cosmopolitans, on the other hand, "are cognitively oriented to a world of structural relations in the larger society and more predisposed toward impersonal, universalistic values and interpretations" (Roof, 1978:45). Since locals tend to personalize their conceptions of reality, they are more likely to accept personal, unsophisticated supernatural beliefs and anthropomorphic conceptions of the deity. Furthermore, such beliefs are more consistent with the traditional life-styles of locals, producing fewer "cognitive strains" for them: "Fewer strains should manifest themselves in adherence to orthodox beliefs, greater personal religiosity, and less doubt" (Roof, 1978: 50). In addition to implicating local-cosmopolitan orientation (localism) as an antecedent of religious commitment, Roof's theory specifies the role localism plays as a mediator of the effects of several well-documented correlates of commitment-community size, length of residence, and education. The effects of community size on commitment are mediated through localism because large cities provide social environments that support non- traditional values and life-styles. Exposure to and opportunities to adopt broadened or more cosmopolitan perspectives are greater in urban than in rural areas. Localism mediates the effects of length of residence on commitment because the longer individuals live in a given community, the more likely they are to develop attachments to that community and thus to possess a localistic perspective. Roof theorizes that localism mediates nearly all of the effects of community size and length of residence on both belonging and meaning aspects of religiosity. Education, however, is theorized to have both direct and indirect influences on the belonging aspect. 304</page><page sequence="3">LOCAL-COSMOPOLITAN THEORY AND CATHOLIC ORDERS Education's indirect influence is attributable to the fact that it exposes individuals to new perspectives and values, thereby increasing the extent to which their outlook is cosmopolitan. Education's direct influence reflects a "status effect." Higher status individuals tend to be more involved in religious institutions than lower status individuals as a symbolic means of representing middle-class position. Since education is an important indicator of social status, it should have a positive effect on religious participation which is not mediated through localism. In samples of Southern Baptists (Roof, 1972) and Episcopalians (Roof, 1976, 1978), Roof found the expected positive relationship between localism and several meaning and belonging measures of religious commitment. Furthermore, in the Episcopalian sample, Roof empirically assessed localism's role as a mediator of the effects of community size, length of residence, and education. Localism mediated nearly all of the effects of community size and length of residence on both the belonging and meaning measures of commitment, and education had the theoretically predicted direct and indirect effects on the belonging measures.1 In this paper, local-cosmopolitan theory is tested using a population of Catholic nuns (sisters) and brothers. These religious professionals belong to religious orders and dedicate themselves to carrying out the missions and goals of their orders. Originally, religious orders were essentially total institutions in which individuals led highly routinized, controlled lives and were generally prohibited from interacting with people outside their religious communities. If this were still true today, it would be inappropriate to test localism theory by assessing whether religiosity varies by local community reference. The religious community itself would be the reference group (plausibility structure) which maintains a given world view, making a measure which assesses local versus extra-local attachments irrelevant. Today, however, the total institution concept does not adequately describe religious communities (Murphy &amp; Liu, 1966; Ebaugh, 1977: 51). In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued a decree on the "Renewal of Religious Life" which (among other things) mandated religious orders to adjust to the conditions of contemporary society. In response to the decree, religious orders initiated changes which affected nearly every aspect of convent living and which gave sisters and brothers substantially greater personal autonomy (Neal, 1970; Fay, 1978). The most significant changes, however, occurred primarily in boundary- maintaining structures. Differences between members and nonmembers were formally deemphasized and many of the restrictions placed on associations with out-group members were removed. In fact, in many instances such contacts came to be positively valued as a means to carry out a "renewed" sense of apostolate and witness (Ebaugh, 1977: 120). As Ebaugh describes the impact of Vatican II on women's religious orders: "The structures that once separated religious women from the world are gone. Nuns today dress like their lay counterparts, work alongside of career and married women, choose where they want to work, ... and in many instances are not even recognized by their coworkers as nuns" 1. The authors were able to locate only two other studies which purport to bring evidence to bear on Roof's theory. In one (McGaw, 1979) the author claims that the findings support Roof's theory and in the other (Tamney, 1979) the author claims that they do not. However, neither study employed a direct measure of local-cosmopolitan orientation nor did they empirically assess the notion that such an orientation mediates the effects of length of residence, community size, or education. Thus, they cannot be considered to be direct or rigorous tests of Roof's theory. 305</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION (Ebaugh, 1977: 51). This description of contemporary orders may be somewhat of an overstatement in that the rate of change since Vatican II has been greater in some orders than in others. However, it is true that members of most men's and women's orders have a great deal of freedom to associate with nonmembers which increases the likelihood that they take on reference groups in addition to their own religious communities.2 It is also true that most sisters and brothers have vocations (e.g., teaching, nursing, and social work) which require them to interact on a virtually daily basis with members of their local (secular) communities. Many also belong to lay voluntary organizations and are actively involved in such social issues as civil rights, environmental protection, local neighborhood legislation, and problems of youth (Norr &amp; Schweickert, 1976; Calabro, 1976). Their involvements in these areas bring them into associations with members of their local communities and allow them to express both localistic and cosmopolitan concerns. Consequently, it should be possible to test localism theory by assessing whether religiosity varies by local community reference among brothers and sisters. These religious professionals, like lay people, vary in the extent to which their attachments are local versus extra-local. Furthermore, testing localism theory using this group should have important implications for determining its generalizability. Roof's (1978) major concern lies with the applicability of his theory to mainline Protestants. However, a recent study by the authors (forthcoming, 1984) suggests that at least certain aspects of Roof's theory have greater generalizability than this. Using a sample of lay Catholics, we found the localism construct to be preductive of several measures of religious beliefs. In this study, if it can be demonstrated that localism is also capable of predicting religious beliefs among Catholic religious professionals, it should constitute fairly convincing evidence in support of the aspect of localism theory which links religious beliefs to localism. Moreover, it would provide additional evidence that this aspect of Roof's theory is helpful in understanding the religious beliefs of groups other than mainline Protestants. The authors found essentially no relationship between localism and two measures of institutional commitment (attendance at Mass and receiving holy communion) among lay Catholics. By testing these relationships again among Catholic professionals, it should further clarify the implications that localism has for predicting institutional commitment. Seven belief and behavioral measures of religiosity are included as dependent variables in this study. Two of the measures assess general Christian beliefs and behaviors (literal orthodoxy and church attendance) and several assess beliefs and behaviors unique to, or at least more central to, Catholicsm (belief in the infallibility of the Pope, receiving holy communion, and going to confession). In addition, two "image of God" belief measures are included. One (supernatural determinism) assesses that extent to which one believes that worldly events are controlled by God. The other (divine ordination of social arrangements) assesses the extent to which one believes that existing (unequal) social 2. Even before Vatican II, social contacts with nonmembers increased substantially for many nuns. In 1954, the Sister Formation Movement was established with the goal of improving the professional education of nuns, and as a result of the movement, many nuns began to pursue advanced degrees. Since most orders did not have their own colleges, many nuns attended secular and lay Catholic colleges which increased their contact with people outside the cloister. Moreover, their educational experiences exposed them to a variety of life-styles and intellectual perspectives which undoubtedly influenced the extent to which their outlooks were cosmopolitan (see Ebaugh, 1977:3-5; Ebaugh and Ritterband, 1978). 306</page><page sequence="5">LOCAL-COSMOPOLITAN THEORY AND CATHOLIC ORDERS arrangements are ordained by God. These two measures were included because they may be particularly responsive to differences in local and cosmopolitan cognitive styles. Both images of God imply the existence of a very personal, anthropomorphic being who is not only actively involved in human affairs, but who actually regulates them. In modern, secular society it is doubtful that cosmopolitans, with their broader social perspectives and preference for abstract conceptualizations, could find such views of God tenable or meaningful. METHODS Sample To obtain the data for this analysis, mail questionnaires were sent to the entire population of Catholic nuns and brothers in the Memphis Diocese which includes roughly the western third of Tennessee. The data were collected in the fall of 1981. Prior to sending out the questionnaires, officials of the Diocese informed respondents that the study was being conducted and encouraged them to participate. The mail-out procedures involved two stages. First, the qeustionnaires were sent to respondents accompanied by a personalized cover letter which conformed to the specifications laid out by Dillman (1978). Then, a week later, a follow-up reminder postcard was sent to non-respondents. Of the 218 individuals asked to fill out the questionnaire, 187 did so, which is an 85.8 percent response rate. Measurement The exogenous variables in this study include total education, length of residence in the present community, size of hometown, proportion of total education received in Catholic school and professional status. Total education and length of residence were measured in actual years. Size of hometown was measured on an eight-point scale which ranged from "farm" to "city of a million or more persons." The variable, proportion of total education received in Catholic school, was measured by dividing years of Catholic education by total years of education. Finally, professional status was treated as a dichotomous variable with brothers receiving a value of 1 and nuns a value of 2. Size of hometown is used instead of size of present city (which is the variable used in Roof's Episcopalian study) because of certain geographic restrictions of the sample. The sample includes Catholic nuns and brothers living in the western third of Tennessee which tends to be culturally homogeneous and which has only one metropolitan area, Memphis. Moreover, over 83 percent of the respondents reside in Memphis. Thus, the variance associated with size of present city is highly restricted, which limits this variable's ability to explain variation in localism. The logic of Roof's theory appears to implicate size of hometown as an antecedent of localism for essentially the same reason it implicates size of present city. Individuals raised in urban areas, like individuals currently living in urban areas, have experienced greater exposure to broadened social perspectives than those raised in rural areas. Consequently, size of hometown, which has substantially greater variance than size of present city, is used in this analysis. Proportion of total education received in Catholic school and professional status are included as control variables. Since Catholic schools are concerned with inculcating religious 307</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION values (which may affect one's breadth of perspective) and since the effects of Catholic education on various dimensions of religiosity are well-documented (Greeley &amp; Rossi, 1966, Greeley et aL, 1976), it seems relevant to control for the Catholic school influence.3 Professional status is included as a control variable for empirical reasons. A preliminary analysis of the data revealed that this variable was significantly correlated with localism, the behavioral measures of religiosity, and several of the exogenous variables. Thus, it was deemed important to test the theoretically derived hypotheses while controlling for the possible contaminating effects of professional status.4 The intervening variable, local-cosmopolitan orientation, was measured with three of the localism items included in Roof's Episcopalian survey. These items are: 1. Big cities may have their place, but the local community is the backbone of America. 2. When it comes to choosing someone for a responsible public office in my community, I prefer a person whose family is known and well-established. 3. Despite all the newspaper and TV coverage, national and international events rarely seem as interesting as events that occur right in the local community in which one lives. For each item, responses were assessed on a four-point scale which ranged from "agree strongly" to "disagree strongly." As was true of Roof's (1976: 200) study, these items were randomly distributed throughout the questionnaire to minimize the possibility of a response set bias. The scale points on these items were coded in such a way that higher scores indicate greater localism and then summed to create the composite index which ranged from 3 to 12. Cornbach's alpha yields a reliability coefficient of .668 for these items. In Roofs study, a fourth item was included in the localism index: "The most rewarding organizations a person can belong to are the large, state and nation-wide associations rather than local community clubs and activities." This item was also included in the current study. However, it evidenced essentially no correlation with the other three items, and in a factor analysis it failed to load on the same factor with them. Consequently, it is excluded from the localism index in this study.5 Literal orthodoxy was measured with the same index used in Roof's survey. This index included four items, each of which consists of a list of traditional (orthodox) and nontraditional statements concerning a specific area of Christian beliefs. These areas include 1) the nature of God, 2) the divinity of Jesus, 3) the meaning of the words Heaven 3. In many studies the Catholic school influence is controlled by simply including years of Catholic school and years of total education as independent variables in the same regression equation. This seems inadvisable, however, since there is considerable overlap between the two variables. All respondents who received all their education in Catholic schools receive the same value on both variables, potentially creating multicolinearity. This problem is avoided by controlling for proportion of total education received in Catholic schools instead of years of Catholic education. 4. Since all brothers are males and all nuns are females, it is, of course, impossible to know if any effects professional status has on other variables are attributable to professional status or sex. However, this is not particularly important to the concerns of this study since professional status serves as a control variable. 5. Interestingly, Roof and Perkins (1975) excluded the fourth item from the localism scale in their study of salience in religious commitment. 308</page><page sequence="7">LOCAL-COSMOPOLITAN THEORY AND CATHOLIC ORDERS and Hell, and 4) the Bible. Respondents were asked to select from each list the statement which comes closest to their own belief. For each item, rerspondents who selected a traditional statement received a value of 2; respondents who selected a nontraditional statement received a value of 1 (see Roof, 1978: 221-222; 231-223 for the list of statements associated with each item and for coding information). Summing the values across the four items resulted in a five-point scale which ranged from 4 to 8; higher scores indicate greater orthodoxy. Cornbach's alpha for these items was .600. Belief in the infallibility of the Pope was measured with a single item which read: "Under certain conditions, the Pope is infallible when he speaks on matters of faith and morals" (Greeley et aL, 1976). Divine ordination of social arrangements was also measured with a single item: "One reason there are still so many poor people in America is because God gave people different abilities so the work of the world will get done" (Piazza &amp; Glock, 1979). Responses to both items were assessed on four-point scales ranging from "disagree strongly" (coded 1) to "agree strongly" (coded 4). Supernatural determinism was measured with two items. One read: "Nothing happens in this world unless God wills it" and the other read: "God has a plan for this world and everything that happens to us is part of this plan." Again, responses were assessed on four-point scales ranging from "disagree strongly" (coded 1) to "agree strongly" (coded 4). The Pearson correlation for these items was .553. To create the final index the scale points were summed. Finally, all the behavioral measures of religiosity (frequency of Mass attendance, receiving holy communion, and going to confession) were assessed on six- point scales which included the categories: "never" (coded 1)," "several times a year," "several times a month," "every week," "several times a week," and "every day" (coded 6). As might be expected, given the fact that the respondents are religious professionals, the frequencies of attendance at Mass and receiving holy communion tended to be quite high. Most respondents indicated that they engaged in these activities every week, several times a week, or every day.6 Since Roof's theory implicates localism as an intervening variable between several background variables and religiosity variables, path analysis was employed to analyze the data. The decomposition of effects method proposed by Alwin and Hauser (1975) was used to obtain total, direct, and indirect effects. The zero-order correlations, means, and standard deviations for all variables are reported in Table 1. FINDINGS The path model to be tested in this study is presented in Figure 1.7 The standardized regression coefficients indicating the strength of the effects of the exogenous variables 6. We originally planned to include frequency of private prayer as a dependent variable. However, this proved to be infeasible since this variable was essentially a constant; over 95 percent of the respondents indicated that they pray every day. 7. In his 1976 analysis of his Episcopalian data, Roof tests a fully recursive model and reports the direct and indirect effects of all three exogenous variables on all of the religiosity variables. In his 1978 analysis of the same data, he reports the direct effects of all the exogenous variables, but he reports the indirect effects of only education and community size. In this analysis, a fully recursive model is tested and the direct and indirect effects of all the exogenous variables are reported. 309</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION TABLE 1 BIVARIATE CORRELATIONS, MEANS, AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS FOR ALL VARIABLES (1) Education (2) Localism (3) Size of Hometown (4) Length of Residence (5) Catholic Education* (6) Professional Status (7) Mass Attendance (8) Holy Communion (9) Confession (10) Supernatural Determinism (11) Literal Orthodoxy (12) Papal Infallibility (13) Divine Ordination of Social Arrangements (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) Mean S.D. -.16 .09 -.14 -13 -.37 -.12 -.13 -.31 -.21 -.09 .07 -.18 17.95 4.42 -.08 .17 -.08 -.06 .23 .23 .21 .34 .22 .14 .32 7.32 1.86 -.01 .19 -.23 .04 .02 .03 .12 .05 .08 .12 5.54 2.18 -.06 .04 .15 .16 .20 .36 .28 .09 .19 12.18 12.93 -.10 -.001 1 -.13 -.08 -.12 -.00 -.13 .83 .23 .12 .15 .28 .07 .06 -.08 -.06 .78 .42 .96 .40 .36 .30 .31 .20 5.56 .69 .39 .35 .29 .30 21 5.58 .67 .35 .37 .18 .26 2.26 .67 .37 .07 .44 5.33 1.97 .26 .38 5.89 .89 .16 3.48 .89 1.46 .81 *Catholic education is proportion of total education received in Catholic schools.

Consistent with Roof's theory, localism has a positive effect on each belief variable. Its effects are strongest on supernatural determinism (.281) and divine ordination of social arrangements (.267). However, it also has notable effects on literal orthodoxy (.183) and papal infallibility (.148). Although localism's effect on papal infallibility is weaker than its effects on the other belief variables, it is a notably better predictor of papal infallibility than is any other independent variable. Localism is also the best predictor of the divine ordination variable, and it ranks among the best predictors of supernatural determinism and orthodoxy. Only length of residence has stronger effects on these two variables (.294 and .236, respectively).

From the indirect effects column it is apparent that localism plays a role in mediating the total effects of the exogenous variables. Regardless of which independent-dependent variable combination is considered, a portion of the independent variable's total effect is transmitted through localism. However, localism's importance as an intervening variable should not be overemphasized. The direct effects of length of residence and size of hometown on all of the belief variables are larger than their indirect effects. In addition, education's direct effects on the belief variables are typically larger than its indirect effects. The only instance in which education's indirect effect is larger is when orthodoxy is the dependent variable. The largest indirect effects are those of education on supernatural 8. Tests of significance are not reported in this analysis. Such tests are meaningful if one's concern is to generalize from a probability sample to the population from which the sample was drawn.

Over 30 percent of education's total effect on supernatural determinism (i.e., -.056/-.184 = .304) and nearly 22 percent of its total effect on the divine ordination variable is indirect (-.053/-.244 = .217). The total effects of the exogeneous variables on the behavioral measures of religiosity are decomposed into their direct and indirect components in Table 3. Again, expectations about the relationship between localism and religiosity are supported. Localism has appreciable positive effects on attendance at Mass and receiving holy communion (.220 and .229, respectively). Its effect on going to confession is somewhat smaller than its effects on the other two variables, but it is sufficiently large to be substantively important (.171). Localism's effect on attendance at Mass and receiving holy communion are larger than those of any other variable. However, education and professional status have stronger effects on going to confession (-.219 and .217, respectively). As was true of the belief variables, localism plays a role (albeit a limited one) in mediating the effects of the exogenous variables. In most instances, direct effects are several times larger than indirect effects.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS This study provides fairly strong empirical support for local-cosmopolitan theory. Localism had appreciable positive effects on all seven of the religiosity variables included in the analysis. It turned out to be a better predictor of four of these variables (the divine ordination variable, papal infallibility, attendance at Mass, and receiving holy communion) than any other variable, and it consistently ranked among the best predictors of the other three. In addition, it played a role in mediating the effects of education, length of residence, and size of hometown. However, it was clearly less important as an intervening variable in this study than it was in Roof's Episcopalian study. Roof found that localism typically mediated nearly all of the effects of the exogenous variables. In this study, the exogenous variables typically had larger direct than indirect effects. It should also be noted that</page><page sequence="11">LOCAL-COSMOPOLITAN THEORY AND CATHOLIC ORDERS one of the exogenous variables (size of hometown) had a relatively inconsequential effect on localism. In a previous study (forthcoming, 1984), we tested localism theory using a sample of lay Catholics. While localism proved to be predictive of measures of religious beliefs in that study, it was essentially unrelated to two measures of institutional commitment - attendance at Mass and receiving holy communion. We suggested that a possible explanation for localism's negligible effects on institutional commitment are recent changes in the Catholic Church. In an attempt to modernize the Church, the Second Vatican Council, 1962-1965, initiated far-reaching changes which resulted in substantial departures from traditional Catholic teachings and practices. These changes not only altered what went on within the church (e.g., English instead of Latin Mass, fewer liturgical activities, and lay distributing communion), they also encouraged ecumenism, broadened religious interest, and theological pluralism (Koller, 1979; Faase, 1980; Hoge, 1981). Generally speaking, the pre-Vatican II Church can be characterized as highly authoritarian with formalized rules and rituals defining "proper" religious behavior. The post-Vatican II Church has taken on a more democractic character, encouraging greater lay participation and allowing individual Catholics more freedom to construct their own religous meanings. In other words, the Catholic Church itself has become more open and cosmopolitan, particularly in its social and intellectual perspectives. These departures from tradition may have made the Church less relevant to the life-styles and concerns of the traditionally oriented locals, thereby weakening their commitment to the Church, while the opposite is true of cosmopolitans. If this is true, one would not necessarily expect locals to exhibit greater institutional commitment than cosmopolitans.9 The situation among nuns and brothers, however, may be somewhat different. While these professionals, like lay Catholics, may vary in their perceptions of the desirability of the Church's departures from tradition,'1 an important difference between the two groups is the extent to which they are subject to primary group expectations for religious participation. According to localism theory, a central reason why locals are expected to be more involved in the institutional life of the Church than cosmopolitans is that locals are more sensitive to the expectations of their locally-based primary groups which encourage religious participation. Without doubt, nuns and brothers are more subject than laity to primary group pressure to participate. As religious functionaries, the professionals are not only expected to be actively involved in church activities, they are highly visible to the reference groups which hold these expectations. They are well-known to each other, to other religious functionaries (i.e., the priests), and to the laity. 9. While this explanation is admittedly post hoc, it does account for why among lay Catholics localism is capable of predicting religious beliefs but not institutional commitment. Religious beliefs are a more privatized aspect of religion and thus are less dependent on the direction of institutional change. Such change may weaken (or strengthen) one's commitment to the institution, but not necessarily affect the content of one's private religious beliefs which, according to localism theory, depend more on one's breadth of perspective and disposition to personalize interpretations of reality. 10. It should be pointed out, however, that shortly after Vatican II substantial numbers of sisters and brothers withdrew from their orders (Gannon, 1980:179). White it is difficult to know for certain what accounts for these withdrawals, it is quite possible that many professionals were unhappy with the Vatican II changes, either because they went too far or not far enough. If this is true, those who remain are likely to be rather homogeneous in their support for Vatican II changes, regardless of whether their orientations are local or cosmopolitan. 313</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION Consequently, their failure to participate is clearly apparent to their religious reference groups and, in light of localism theory, one would expect locals, who are more sensitive to primary group pressures, to be more involved than cosmopolitans. The religious participation of local lay Catholics, on the other hand, is less intensely scrutinized and it is even questionable whether their reference groups strongly encourage participation. If local Catholics are generally disillusioned by church changes, it is not unreasonable to expect that they tend to associate with other disillusioned Catholics, in which case their reference group support for participation is not likely to be very strong. In conclusion, the findings of this study provide rather strong support for Roof's theory. When one considers the fact that localism has been found to predict religiosity among Southern Baptists (Roof, 1972), Episcopalians (Roof, 1978), lay Catholics (the authors, forthcoming), and now even Catholic religious professionals, it appears as though localism theory has predictive utility in quite diverse religious groups. Obviously, additional research is needed using other religious groups to better determine the theory's credibility and the extent of its generalizability. Nevertheless, taken collectively, the above studies constitute fairly convincing evidence that localism theory is useful in understanding religious commitment.
