<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Lippitt, ed. Nietzsche's Futures. Macmillan, 1999. isbn 0333-68258-0. M. D. Price Nietzsche's Futures is a compendium of essays adapted from papers given at the 1995 confer ence of the Nietzsche Society. John Lippitt divides the works thematically into three sections, "Nobles and Exemplars " "Laughter and Comedy," and "Art, Nature, and the Transhuman." There are some formidable contributions in the first two sections from Daniel Conway, Brian Domino, and Kathleen Marie Higgins, but it is only in the third section that the collection achieves a degree of consistency in rising to the challenge of the question of futurity in Nietzsche's thought David Owen's paper opens the collection with an examination of the relationship between Nietzsche's attempts to legislate against transcendent sources of moral authority and the Enlightenment ideal of self-government. He makes some interesting comments on the Enlightenment paradox of replacing one sort of transcendent authority with another, and the analytic tone of the piece is well suited to untying such methodological knots as the "purpose of genealogy," not least of which is "the recommendation of a goal." The essay moves a little too swiftly to avoid the question of the extent to which it is itself programmed by an uncritical assumption of Enlightenment-humanistic values: our disgust at the sight of the last man should spur us on to "ethical activity oriented to the telos of the Overman," says Owen. He moves on</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 105 to conclude how this "noble ethics in which mutual recognition, honesty, loyalty, magnanimity and even courtesy" feeds into Nietzsche's "generous vision of human relations." Conway's contribution raises some interesting questions about Nietzsche's political task of creating a suitable readership for his works, a task intimately bound up with issues of tempo rality. Through a thoughtful reading of Nietzsche's 1886 prefaces, Con way argues that the "recur sive elements of self-reference and self-criticism" amount to a strategy for reforming both text and reader. This reclamation of the past text with a preface as a preparatory tool for future read ings is linked by Conway to the Dionysian self-induced rebirth in a particularly able and con vincing manner. In thus enriching the resources of any future readership, Nietzsche is not merely exhorting them to the practice of good philology: it is a tactic that "he submits as a model... for the possible regeneration of humankind as a whole," a promised futurity that depends to a large degree on the ability to reinterpret and reconfigure the past. The third and final essay in this section centers upon the problem of decadence and the erotic-aesthetic attitude to history that Domino designates as "ecstatic." This is a finely-thought-out piece, especially in its analy sis of Stendahl's influence on Nietzsche's aesthetics. Domino's essay ends with a warning that postmodernism tends to collapse into nihilism and incoherence, inasmuch as it makes the past equal to the present, thereby poisoning the future. . M. Higgins's solid scholarship dominates the second section, "Laughter and Comedy." Higgins provides us with a powerfully illuminating account of the relationship between the his torical Zarathustra and Nietzsche's godless preacher of the eternal return. The essay begins by exploring the stylistic affinities, ironies, and narrative parallels between the Zoroastrian scrip ture The Zend-Avesta and Thus Spoke Zarathustra. It moves through an excellent account of the complexities of the historical Zarathustra 's metaphysics, morals, and cosmology to an exami nation of the self-destructive (and self-overcoming) potential of this moral-philosophical exper iment. Higgins relates this self-overcoming of morality to the notion of tragedy via section 342 of The Gay Science, a section almost identical with the opening part of Zarathustra's Prologue. Yet the serious tone of this passage, Higgins suggests, should not blind us to the possibility of a comic interpretation of the gruesome moral history of the Platonic and Judeo-Christian dis asters that the historical Zarathustra draws in his wake: Higgins points our attention from sec tion 342's "incipit tragoedia" to the "incipit parodia" of the preface to the second edition. This revaluation of the historical Zarathustra as a self-parodying exemplar points us away from the Platonic-Christian enterprise with its miserable saints of knowledge to a cosmic joviality: "Recalling this beginning of our philosophical era, Nietzsche also reminds us that the era will end. Even more?by returning to the beginning of the book, Nietzsche suggests that we have already embarked on ending it, for we have already experientially set about starting a new era to the extent that we are already practicing 'the gay science.'" The third section of the collection, "Art, Nature, and the Transhuman," ups the philosophi cal stakes considerably. James Urpeth's essay gets straight into the highly pertinent issue of the ends of the human, for to talk about the future of the human we need an examination of the lim its of the human, that is to say, an engagement with conditions of possibility. As Urpeth notes, it is Nietzsche's understanding of the nature of the relationship between art, the Dionysian, and futurity that proves decisive for one of the central tasks of his thought?"the overcoming of man." Nietzsche asks us to overcome both humanism and pessimism, and the limits of the human are disclosed by an affirmation of aesthetic experience?the "tragic sublime." It is only through this critique of the very notion of the human as metaphysical pessimism and negation?as "that which is not nature"?that it becomes possible to evade a condemnation of this world, "nature," the body, and the senses as flawed and fallen phenomena. The demise of the human can, on the basis of such a critique, be affirmed. This is a complex, busy essay to which it is difficult to do justice in a short review, and its compressed form demands careful reading (section IV in par ticular). Nevertheless, Urpeth always remains lucid and thought-provoking.</page><page sequence="3">106 Thomas H. Brobjer Like Urpeth, but for rather different reasons, Gary Banham takes up the question of the future of the human as an aesthetic problem. This piece disentangles, illuminates, and elaborates the themes of aesthetics, physiology, futurity, and decadence via Nietzsche's diagnosis of Wagner as a "total sickness. Drawing out the links between Nietzsche's thought and Kant's Critique of Judgement, Banham argues powerfully that aesthetics itself?albeit an expanded notion of aes thetics drawn from Kant's various uses of that term?is the key to any understanding of futu rity for Nietzsche: "The relationship between creator and created is decisive for understanding the difference between legislating in a way that creates the future and legislates in a way that perpetuates the present." Thus aesthetics becomes a "problem of futural legislation," a weapon against the herd and its chronic tendency to sacrifice the (overhuman) future to the image of the (human) present and to kill the "most distant man" in the name of the neighbor. The first three sections of Graham Parkes 's essay, "Staying Loyal to the Earth," take us through the development of Nietzsche's thinking on nature until the fully matured doctrine of will to power in Beyond Good and Evil. Parkes explores Nietzsche's analysis of the extent to which any human thinking about nature is commingled with anthropomorphism and theological think ing, while remaining sensitive to the problematics of replacing the denigrated phenomenal "nature" of Christian-Platonic metaphysics with a divinized neo-pagan "nature." What is par ticularly pleasing about this essay is the manner in which it presents Nietzsche as a truly exper imental philosopher. Parkes relates the future of the human (and the overhuman) to a rethinking of nature understood as will to power. Despite some extremely interesting hints in section VII toward the possibilities of a Deleuzeo-Guatarrian becoming-animal, toward the end of the work Parkes seems to swerve from his incisive, critical, and broadly antihumanist trajectory into an exhortation to combat the otherwise undefined "cynical" forces "responsible for the devastation of the earth." Finally we have Keith Ansell-Pearson's essay on the meaning of the transhuman condition. Developing out of a close reading of On the Genealogy of Morals, the opening moves trace out the importance of futurity as a constitutive element of the human. The "poison" accompanying the human attempt to legislate for a future?morality?is considered as much a promise as a threat, for "it has also cultivated a strange and fascinating breeding ground for his extra moral self-overcoming." Thus the purpose and urgency of reading deeper into the moral past: such a task emerges as a prerequisite to answering the question "What might yet be made of man?" The second part of the essay opens with a timely rebuff to the cyber-optimists: a future tran shuman condition that panders to the values of efficiency, optimal memory, downloading the ego, and other fantasial escapes from the vagaries of the flesh is hardly the transvaluation Nietzsche's philosophy aims at. Clearly there is more at stake in thinking the transhuman than either a leaving behind of the human in some sort of perfectionist-evolutionist linear develop ment, or indeed an attempt to fall back into an equally fantasial state of equilibrial relations with nature. Both positions forget that models of evolution are "nothing other than inventions of man," and both positions are complicit with a metaphysical humanism. Drawing on resources from Deleuze and Guatarri's work, the essay points us toward a notion of a transhumanity and a futu rity that is "a question neither of man nor machines but solely of non-human becomings." It is strange that not more is said about the transformation of the very notion of futurity in light of the eternal return, given the extraordinary importance that Nietzsche himself attached to the idea. Nietzsche envisioned his mature work as a "prelude to a philosophy of the future." Perhaps the challenge for future readers of Nietzsche must be to question how a "revaluation of all values" also transforms the critical space in which the very value of philosophy's future is not begged by a metaphysical humanism.</page></plain_text>
