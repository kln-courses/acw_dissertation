<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARGEIPHONTES IN HOMER-THE DRAGON-SLAYER By S. DAVIS A CCORDING to Elliot Smith, the dragon 'is most intimately asso- ciated with the earliest stratum of divinities, for it has been homologized with each of the members of the earliest Trinity, the Great Mother, the Water God, and the Warrior Sun God, both indivi- dually and collectively. To add to the complexities of the story, the dragon-slayer is also represented by the same deities, either individually or collectively; and the weapon with which the hero slays the dragon is also homologous both with him and his victim, for it is animated by him who wields it, and its powers of destruction make it a symbol of the same power of evil which it itself destroys." Wherever it is found the dragon displays a special partiality for water. It dwells in pools or wellsz or in the clouds on the tops of mountains, or at the bottom of the sea where it guards vast treasures, or even on the top of a high mountain.3 It has the same characteristics everywhere, for the dragon of the North is essentially the same as that of the South and the East, an evil power, guarding hoards and withholding good things from men. 'The slaying of a dragon is the achievement of heroes-of Siegmund, of Beowulf, of Sigurd, of Arthur, of Tristram. ... But if in the West the dragon is usually a "power of evil", in the far East he is equally emphatically a symbol of beneficence. He is identified with emperors and kings; he is the son of heaven, the bestower of all boun- ties.'4 G. Elliot Smith, The Evolution of the Dragon (Longmans, 1919), PP. 77-78; cf. ibid., p. 81. The dragon is actually a composite wonder-beast ranging from western Europe to the Far East of Asia and to America. 'In most places where the dragon occurs the substratum of its anatomy consists of a serpent or a crocodile usually with the scales of a fish for covering, and the feet and wings, and sometimes also the head, of an eagle, falcon or hawk, and the forelimbs and sometimes the head of a lion.' Cf. A. C. Swinburne's 'Hertha', in the Oxford Book of English Verse (Clarendon Press, 1912), P. 925: 'I am stricken, and I am the blow. I the mark that is miss'd And the arrows that miss.' 2 Cf. Augustine Birrell, Essays, 1899, ii. 14o: 'From the dragon-warder'd foun- tains Where the springs of knowledge are.' 3 Elliot Smith, op. cit., pp. 81-82. 4 Ibid., pp. 78 ff. Elliot Smith would trace back the mythical conflict of hero and dragon to the earliest known of such conflicts, that between Osiris (later, his son Horus) and his enemy Set. Cf. p. i37. Set, the enemy of Osiris, is the real prototype of the evil dragon and so the prototype of Satan. The Biblical references to Satan identify him with the dragon who is mentioned (Rev. xx. 2) 3871.64 D</page><page sequence="2">34 ARGEIPHONTES IN HOMER-THE DRAGON-SLAYER Apollo, Kadmus, Perseus, Jason, Heracles, and perhaps Hermes, and their subsequent successors in European literature, are all varied aspects of one and the same hero who is reputed to slay a dragon. Apollo's killing of the dragon at Delphi was commemorated by the epithet apyE'iq6vrr1s.' This term has been variously interpreted. As applied in Homerz to Hermes, the traditional rendering is 'the slayer of Argos'. Argos3 was a monster of huge strength and size, who had a third eye in the back of his neck, or four eyes, two before and two behind, or many eyes.4 When Io, pursued by the ardent Zeus, was turned into a heifer, Hera out of jealousy set Argos to watch her, but Hermes killed him at Zeus' command.s It has been asserted that, as there is no evidence that Homer knew of the legend of Io, the interpretation of the term dpyEdi6v-rrS as 'slayer of Argos' may have been invented to explain the word. This is what the editors of almost every commentary on the Odyssey claim. Furthermore they derive the word from two others, apy6s 'bright' or 'swift' and the root ofpafivco 'shine', 'appear', thus giving the interpretation 'the brightly, or swiftly, appearing one'. 'Others regard the word as an inexplicable pre-Greek name, like BEAAEpoqp6v-rqs.'6 The editors of the most recent edition of Liddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon accept the interpretation of the term as 'Slayer of Argos',7 as applied to Hermes, but state that it has been variously explained by grammarians; for example, Cornutuss derives the word from &amp;py65 'white', 'clear', or 'swift' and cpaivc 'appear'. The interpretations of most modern scholars seem to rest on Cornutus' view; yet he is late, writing in the first century A.D. However, Liddell and Scott state that the epithet is also applied to Apollo. As early as the fifth century B.C. the as 'the old serpent which is the Devil and Satan'. Cf. p. 81. In Babylonia the story of Tiamat, the dragon whom Marduk fought, is another variation of the same theme; so, too, the tale of Gilgamesh and the serpent. I Sophocles, fr. 1024.

According to the grammarian Pausanias,z &amp;pyE'q6vTrls is derived from &amp;py-s 'snake'3 and means 'serpent-slayer', i.e. Apollo. The second part of the word apparently has some connexion with a word like pov?uco 'slay'. It is interesting to note, too, that Aeschines uses &amp;pyas meaning 'snake' as a nickname for his inveterate political enemy, Demosthenes.4 The Etymologicum Gudianum states that in Homer and many sources the term &amp;pyiq*p6vTrl is applied to Hermes, in Sophocles to Apollo, and in Parthenius also to Telephus.S Thus there is a strong tradition that apyEi'q6v-rrs meant 'serpent- slayer' and nothing else. If the term has this meaning as applied to Apollo as slayer of the Pythian dragon, and to Telephus about whom there may have been a similar legend, can one avoid the implication that it also had this meaning as applied to Hermes? In myth many gods gained fame by the slaughter of monsters. Apollo, indeed, was often called IuveoKTr6voS; so that from the first it is likely that apyE'iq6v-rrs meant 'serpent-slayer'. Hermes' connexion with a snake-spirit the cult of which he replaced, as Apdllo did, is most likely. In legend the symbolized cult-hero is represented as slaying a serpent. If Homer does not know of the myth of Io but nevertheless uses the term apyEY'q6vTr1j as applied to Hermes, Aeschylus does know the story but treats it in his own way. He represents Argos as a herdsman playing on his pipes.6 But this is only an anthropomorphic version of an original snake-spirit. Just as Aeschylus, according to Jane Harrison, humanized the Erinys7-for Clytaemnestra's mention of 8pa&lt;Kacva Soph. fr. oz24. 2 Pausanias, fr. 65 in Aelii Dionysii et Pausaniae Atticistarum Fragmenta, ed.

The emphasis laid by ancient writers on the all-seeing eye2 of the monster would tend to bear out the impression that Argos was a snake. In Africa there is a curious tradition of precious or shining stones in the heads of reptiles. The sacred African python in Nigeria is believed by many tribes to carry a precious magical stone in its head which is able to shed a strong, bright light.3 A similar belief in Greece may have given rise to the tradition of a many-eyed monster who significantly possesses not two but three, four, or more eyes.4 Thus Aeschylus' earth-born Argos with his myriad eyes and crafty gaze may be equated to a serpent.S It is significant that the caduceus (KqpIKElOV) of Hermes consisted of a staff above which were twined two serpents. Hermes' staff is very much like the Tri-Ratna of Buddhism, which consisted of two serpents twining round a staff and forming a circle and a crescent symbolic of the sun and moon-the only difference being that Hermes' staff is placed below the serpents. The caduceus of Hermes, like that of the Egyptian god Anubis, was regarded as powerful for paralysing the mind and raising the dead.6 In Egypt all this goes back to a serpent cult which is connected with sun-worship; hence in Africa shining stones are associated with the python: by analogy Hermes' similar powers as symbolized by his staff are also derived from a serpent cult. Usually associated with the snake cult are healing powers and the gift of prophecy, an omphalos, a cave, and a medium or Pythia. Healing powers and the gift of prophecy, both closely connected in antiquity, are found in the case of Asklepios, Apollo, and Trophonios, who are all associated with a snake cult.7 Roscher points out that the 'omphalos was ' Aesch.

Garnier, The Worship of the Dead (Chapman and Hall, London, 1904), p. 109. 7 The name Asklepios is connected by some with &amp;odxKa3os 'serpent' or 'lizard'. Asklepios not only cured all the sick but called the dead back to life again (Pindar, Pyth. iii). The essential part of his temple worship was the sleep- ing in the temple itself (incubatio), where an oracle through a dream revealed to the patient the method of cure (Arist. Plut. 421 ff.). For Trophonios see Paus. ix. 36. 6. He was said to inhabit a cave in the shape of a snake: snakes were sacred to him as they were to Asklepios.</page><page sequence="5">ARGEIPHONTES IN HOMER-THE DRAGON-SLAYER 37 a particular attribute of Asklepios and of Hermes, both variants of the pre-historic semi-chthonic serpent hero known at Delphi as Python'.' His cult the intruder Apollo replaced, and his grave is represented as being under an omphalos. Here one god sets up his temple and abode over the supposed grave of another and assumes his characteristic traits. The omphalos with its beehive shape 'is in miniature the form of the Tumulus or Soros that marks a hero's grave as represented in vase paintings from very early times'.2 It seems that in the case of Asklepios the snake-spirit was anthropo- morphized into a hero-god who kept the original characteristics of the snake cult, but that Hermes, like Apollo, replaced such a cult since, like him, he is termed 'Argeiphontes' or 'dragon-slayer'. Hermes' con- nexion with the original snake-spirit is shown by his adopting a snake- design for his wand or KlqplKETov (caduceus). As has been indicated, this symbol has characteristics that belong to the snake cult. Hermes also has an oracle at Pharae in the Peloponnese3 and an obscure minor form of divining which Apollo is supposed to have granted him.4 A medium or Pythia is found in the case of Apollo both at Delphi and in Epiruss and, among the Thracian Bessoi, at an oracle of Dionysos who is also connected with a snake cult.6 The Pythia gave prophecies in a state of rapt ecstasy.7 Greece is not the only country where such a medium of the snake god is known. There are African parallels with this ritual.8 Thus there was from very early times in many localities on the Greek mainland a widespread snake cult, and 'Argeiphontes', the Homeric epithet of Hermes, is an indication that Apollo's cult was not the only one that usurped the functions properly belonging to such a snake cult. In the case of Apollo, however, the evidence is much stronger. In his case we are not forced to rely merely on an epithet, a magician's staff with a serpent twined round it, healing powers, and an oracle. We have most of these characteristic traits and others besides to prove his con- nexion with a previous snake cult. The cult that Hermes replaced, it can be surmised, had originally many characteristics that have dis- x L. B.

These are found associated with the cult of Apollo, viz. the omphalos,' the Pythia,2 the phiale,3 the tripod,4 as well as the prophetic and healing powers5 associated with Hermes. In view of all the evidence mustered, our conclusion is that 'pyEiq6vtrls in Homer, as applied to Hermes, can only mean 'dragon-' or 'serpent- slayer'. This interpretation would fit all the known facts of gods who, like Apollo, replaced or absorbed a pre-existing snake cult. I For the omphalos as the grave-mound of the Python snake cf.
