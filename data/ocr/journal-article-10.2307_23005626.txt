<plain_text><page sequence="1">Raimon Panikkar Faith: a constitutive human dimension If you do not believe, you will not exist.1 — Isaiah VII, 91 The problem, to begin with, is that contemporary human experience—followed, generally with delay, by philosophers—clearly shows that Man, when deprived of faith, does not know how to bear the weight of an existence torn by internal struggles, nor can he sustain the continual demand to surmount the tensions created by communal life. Deprived of faith, Man collapses. From a phenomenological point of view, one could say that Man is being 'designed' to function in the realm of faith. Believe that You May Understand Such a fact is plausible not only phenomenologically but also within traditional philosophy. Man, as a conscious being, can only be founded in truth—and ultimately be—if, in some way or other, he can see, intuit, comprehend, believe that his existential situation has a founda Note: Some elements of style such as the use of capital letters and lower case are peculiar to Panikkar, which we have retained. On the use of the word Man to mean human beings, we quote Panikkar's own words"... Man means the androgynous human being and not the male element which has hitherto monopolized it... it is not that the masculine stands for the whole Man, but that the whole man has allowed this untoward domination by the male. The solution is not juxtaposition (he/she etc.) but integration."—Ed. 34</page><page sequence="2">Raimon Panikkar / 35 tion that is not himself. Without this awareness his existence is muti lated. A plant lives as long as sap runs in its stalk; Man needs that ontic sap, which gives him his being, runs up to his head and heart. Any philosophy uses similar arguments. Hinduism and buddhism would say empirical Man is not his own foundation—be it symbolized by fullness, nothingness or any other pertinent symbol. Faith is precisely that x in Man which makes possible the 'recognition' of the foundation, for by it Man is united (at least intentionally) to this foundation. A human being cannot attain his destiny if he does not 'recognize' the foundation of his being. Now faith is precisely what manifests this foundation. Without faith Man cannot live an authentic human life. A passage from the Bhagavad Gita seems to express what I wish to say: just as there are three kinds of Man according to classical Indian anthropology, there are three types of faith, one corresponding to each of these fundamental human types. 'Man is made by faith: As the faith r\ f O so the Man.' Without now investigating the notion of Sraddha (faith)—which originally signified the theandric condition essential to the efficacy of the sacrifice—it can be said that our thesis is in harmony with the spirit of the indie religions4 and in general with every religion.5 We may go further: The mediaeval christian said, Crede ut intel ligas (Believe that you may understand).6 This expression does not indicate just the ontological priority of faith with respect to reason, i.e. the existential situation in which Man cannot understand if he does not believe. It is something more, and it is this intuition I wish to comment upon.7 Believe that You May Be Faith is not only necessary in order to understand, but also to reach full humanity, to be. In other words, faith is a constitutive human dimension. By faith Man is distinguished from other beings. But precisely because of this, faith is a human characteristic that unites mankind. Thus faith is not the privilege of some individuals or the monopoly of certain defined groups, however large their member ship. Faith is not a superfluous luxury, but an anthropological dimen sion of the full human being on earth.8 We maintain that if creatureliness can be said to be simple relation to God, to the Source, or whatever name we give the foundation of beings, faith is another name for the ontological relation to this mystery that characterizes Man, distinguishing him from all other</page><page sequence="3">36 / Faith: a constitutive human dimension beings. If beings as such are nothing but this relation (the creature neither is nor has its foundation in itself), Man is that unique being whose rapport with the foundation becomes the ontological link that constitutes him as Man. In saying 'relation' to 'God', I am not assuming a kind of merely 'private' link with an exclusivistic and anthropomorphic God, but the constitutive radical relativity of all things, so that this link is not a solitary 'relation' to an only transcendent 'God' but a relation of solidarity with the whole of Reality. The traditional way of expressing this view would be to say that the 'theological virtues' are also cos mological ones or, in a word, cosmotheandric. Faith, Hope and Love are not only vertical, but also horizontal. If religion (from religare: to tie again, to re-link) is what links Man to his foundation, faith is what frees him from mere cosmic existence, from being simply a thing. Freedom arises in this opening to, or rupture from, his subjection to the realm of objects. By this freedom Man is placed at the heart of the personal trinitarian relations, sharing in the creative act of the Divine. The relation between God and Man can in no way be free unless there is freedom within the Godhead itself and Man is somehow integrated into the intra-divine free-play. This is what the idea of the Trinity, in any of its forms, is saying.9 It may be important to add that this thesis, although expressed in a particular language, need not be linked to a single philosophy or religious tradition. It claims to be as valid for a buddhist as for one who calls himself an atheist. The meaning of words depends not simply upon the semantic expression, but also upon a whole collection of cultural connections that should not obscure our central theme or turn us aside from it. On the other hand, I may be excused from not undertaking excursions into other cultural worlds and not utilizing other frames of reference. All terminology is just the concrete objec tification of a cultural system. A discourse in totally abstract terms, i.e., lacking any cultural connections or reference, is impossible. The reader may find it easier to understand what I am saying if he trans lates my words into those of his own personal frame of reference. The Consequences This thesis has important consequences. It provides the key to one of the most important problems of our time: the encounter of religions. In other words, it delivers us from the impasse in which the science of religions currently finds itself. It suggests the astonishing possibility</page><page sequence="4">Raimon Panikkar. / 37 that the encounter of religions might be a religious dialogue—even at the level of faith—rather than a mere rational dispute. It may also serve to free religion from its exclusivistic aspects, its frequent sectarian character and from an archaic unilateralism incompatible with the process of openness in which humanity is engaged. Recognizing faith as an anthropological dimension situates the encounter between people on a fully human plane and does not exclude religion from the dialogue.10 In a human encounter worthy of the name, it is not enough that Men recognize their brotherhood in shared biological functions or elemental needs while raising barriers when it is a question of a deeper embrace. One cannot put faith in parenthesis any more than one can bracket reason when truly human understanding is at stake, unless one would castrate Man and render him not only infertile but monstrous. Faith is the foundation and guarantee of human relations. Banishing it would inevitably condemn us to solipsism by destroying the last possible foundation for a path to any transcendence, beginning with that transcendence which allows ourselves to 'go out' of ourselves and meet our fellow-beings without alienation. Understood in this way, faith is also a condition for love and guarantees its creativity. Faith cannot be ignored in considering the deepest realities of human life; it is part of a fully human existence on earth. Every profound human encounter in which faith is left to one side can only appear hypocritical to someone who does not think he has faith, for in such a meeting, the so-called non-believer does not meet the believer on the same level if the latter has bracketed his faith; what is ultimate and definitive for the first is only penultimate and provisional for the second, and vice versa. For the Man of faith, there is no real encounter because by putting his faith in brackets he shuts away precisely what the 'non-believer' would like to put on the table. Further, we can suggest that it is in and by faith that the believer 'communicates' and fraternizes with the Man who calls himself a non-believer. Removed from this deep level of faith, human fraternity becomes an infra-human communication of the biological order or even an artificial contact, like a computer that always gives the same results when fed the same data. Reason does not get us out of this situation because it divides, decides and distinguishes, but does not unite.</page><page sequence="5">38 / Faith: a constitutive human dimension For several centuries, western Man has been indoctrinated that his humanity (and consequently his universality) was grounded in reason. The effort to discard theology and faith along with it—to reduce the latter to a corner in humanity's sacristy so that the real human encounter can be realized in the domain of pure reason, of true and uncontaminated philosophy—has characterized 'modern' philosophy since Descartes. According to this view^ faith would be a privilege gratuitously given by God to the few. Faith would then separate Men while reason would unite them and provide the pos sibility for universal human communication. Theologies differ, it is said, precisely because they are based on something 'more than human'. As a result, rational philosophy becomes the universal science and following the judgements of reason appears the only way to attain, if not a celestial, at least a terrestrial paradise. 'Two and two make four anywhere' is the popular summary of this attitude. 'Religion divides people while reason unites them' is its sociological translation. As the only source of universal knowledge, rational philosophy is thus op posed to theology, which it construes as merely exegesis of gratuitous propositions. However, the recent historical and philosophical evolution has put Man, mostly western Man, on guard against a naive rationalistic optimism. Today, after two world wars, a cold war and so many atrocious wars before our own eyes, after the failure of idealism and the ensuing chaos of philosophy, faced with an almost worldwide revolution of an entire generation against another, our confidence in reason has been thoroughly shaken. We are actually beginning to suspect that 'two and two do not make four' except in a purely ideal and abstract realm. It is the revolt of life, of the concrete, which refuses to be imprisoned or paralyzed in reason's formalism. Two roses and two violets make four flowers, to be sure; but completely different from two lilies and two jasmines, although these are also four flowers. Is love for a mother plus love for God the same as love for a car plus love for a garden? Reality cannot be so simply manipulated. Faced with the non-reasonable situation of the world, the defend ers of 'pure reason' advance the argument of contamination. The failure of reason, they say, is due to something for which reason itself is not responsible: in itself reason is infallible, but in operation, desires, passions and feelings mutilate it, render it impotent. The argument, however, is not convincing. First of all, it begs the question and</page><page sequence="6">Raimon Panikkar / 39 demands a far greater leap of logic than that of the famous, and so often misunderstood, 'ontological argument'. In fact, it represents, a jump from the 'real order', which we experience as fallible and non rational, to the 'ideal order' of pure reason by postulating the infal libility of reason. Further, the argument is unconvincing because, even if it were to prove anything, it would be useless: a reason that is theoretically infallible and practically impotent cannot help us. We are not concerned with knowing the theoretical rights of 'pure' reason, but with what can actually guide Man. Reason verifies (falsifies) and criticizes; it does not discover and guide. Perhaps we have been seduced by a distorted definition of Man, by removing its most salient element, animality, and so converting Man into a 'logical' being.11 In addition, logos is often interpreted in an excessively rationalistic fashion. But I am not interested in attacking reason. The word 'reason' does not need to stand only for a merely Cartesian reason, and today this word includes the entire mediaeval meaning of intellect and even more. The urgency of our problematic, however, lies in another direc tion, whose importance and gravity we discover when we confront it. One of the most striking phenomena of our age is atheism. The various manifestations of contemporary atheism generally coincide with denying the object of religious faith: such atheism denies the christian affirmation of the existence of God, rejects the theistic affirmation of transcendence, etc. Today, somebody is often declared an unbeliever because he refuses to objectivize his faith and does not wish to limit the possibilities of his existence by being recognized as a member of a part of humanity—more or less great—but nevertheless only a part. We could say that a certain monopoly of faith on the part of some groups has taken from him the possibility of believing.12 At this point the gravity of our theme appears: Faith cannot be recovered because it was never lost. It is purified because its content is questioned as being ever inadequate. We might mention in passing two connected problems: the 'loss of faith' and 'conversion'. Does one really lose faith or is one simply abandoning certain beliefs? Does faith disappear and does Man flee the light? We refer to the so-called great crisis of faith that besets our epoch. Have the catholics of post-Vatican II lost their 'faith' because they no longer believe what their ancestors held to be the case? Have the neo-marxists and euro-communists to lose their identity because</page><page sequence="7">40 / Faith: a constitutive human dimension they no longer agree with orthodox party lines? And conversion: is it a real change of faith or a return to an interiority enabling us to discover what we, in an inadequate or unconscious way, already believed? Would not every conversion be a gnosis, a knowing, a metanoia, a change of mind, which reveals to us the true name or the authentic belief of what we already believed? We refer to the great traumas caused by conversion into other religious 'creeds' that no longer need imply a rupture from an abjura tion of the previous tradition. Has a hindu becoming christian to denounce all his hindu past? Or has a christian becoming buddhist to forego what he still believes is valid in the christian tradition? Or has an indonesian becoming muslim to sponsor the arab cause? Has conversion necessarily to entail alienation? Should we then not distin guish between faith and belief?13 The Three Instances of Faith To elaborate a little further, I wish to bring to mind two conceptions of faith that illustrate this inexhaustible problematic. 14 The first conception, founded on the primacy of an essentialistic conception of Truth, leads one to identify faith with orthodoxy, i.e., with correct doctrine properly formulated. The second insists on the moral character of the religious act, based on the supremacy of the Good, and consequently leads one to identify faith with orthopoiesis, (right-doing) with the attitude and moral deportment that lead Man to his destiny. It should be clear by now that we have taken the Aristotelian concepts 'poiesis' and 'praxis' as relevant for our distinc tions. By the first we understand human activity whose result falls on the external object to which the act is directed: in the second, the act reverts on the agent himself and transforms him. If the first risks 'dogmatism', the second skirts 'moralism'. These two interpretations may not be false but only one-sided. We offer the notion of faith as orthopraxis (right-acting). Orthopraxis does not centre faith in another particular faculty of Man, but links it to his very being seen as act. If Man as Man is a religious being, his religion cannot be a sect, his religiousness cannot be one element among others. Rather his religion must be based on this free movement that penetrates the totality of his being, rejoining his most profound existence to its source. Faith is what gives him this freedom.</page><page sequence="8">Raimon Panikkar / 41 Man possesses intelligence and will. He rushes forward drawn toward the Truth and the Good. But he is not exhausted there, or, better said, these primordial activities spring from an even more radical source: his very being, and his being is act. Human life is not exhausted either in the thought process or in extrinsic constructions: Man is much more than a spectator or constructor of the world. Above all he is an actor; fundamentally he enacts himself through his capacity—not exhausted by his facere (to do)—to embrace his agere (to act) as well. His activity is not simply poiesis, but above all praxis. Herein lies the meaning of the sacred action that all religions recognize: the horizon of orthopraxis. Through faith Man becomes himself; in other words, he is saved, completed, attains his fullness, obtains liberation, his final end, by whatever name he may call it. Religions do not claim primarily to provide each a doctrine or a technique. They claim to save Man, i.e., to liberate him or, in other words, to open for him the way to the fullness of his being, whatever this fullness may be. When this end is interpreted as an intellectual vision, the doctrinal aspect comes to the fore. If, on the other hand, it is seen as a reward for a life, for moral conduct, the practical values have the primacy. But in both cases, they presuppose that human fullness consists in acquiring this value that lies at the centre of human finality. Orthopraxis illuminates a fact prior to all doctrine and all deport ment: Man should reach his goal and fullness, however we may interpret these expressions. Praxis is that human activity which modifies and fashions not only Man's exterior existence but also the interior dimension of his life. The effect of praxis is part of Man's very being: it is the salvific activity par excellence. Within a certain metaphysical framework, praxis is that activity which actualizes the potentiality of the human being. "Work out your salvation with diligence", said Gautama just before his death. The quintessence of faith, then, reflects this aspect of Man that moves him towards fullness, this dimension by which Man is not closed up in his present state but open to perfection, to his goal or destiny, according to the schema one adopts. Faith is not fundamen tally the adhesion to a doctrine or an ethic. Rather, it is manifest as an act that opens to us the possibility of perfection, permitting us to attain to what we are not yet. The notion of orthopraxis does not eliminate</page><page sequence="9">42 / Faith: a constitutive human dimension the possibility of erroneous actions, but it excludes the possibility of interpreting them only in terms of doctrine or morality. Every action that leads to the perfection of Man in his concrete existential situation, every action that leads Man to his realization, is authentic praxis, way to salvation. Faith as Human Invariant Theological Consideration Beyond orthodoxy and orthopoiesis, we can still ask what comprises the real essence of faith. Having posed the theological problem in this way, we are led to seek the structure of faith belonging to the very constitution of Man. Now a critique of an exclusivistic faith should not cause us to go to the other extreme and defend a universality that excludes all discrimina tion and difference. On earth Man is not perfect: He is neither fully Man nor truly God (realized, risen,...). He has the capacity to become what he must be in order to realize his destiny; in fact, he must actualize it concretely The first capacity we call 'faith', the second 'act of faith'. Philosophical Reflection We seek something in Man that links him to transcendence, brings him to his end (Absolute, God, Nothingness or whatever); in other words something that makes progress possible toward what Man is not yet, the bridge connecting him with his destiny. This 'something' must be sufficiently ample and universal to constitute the foundation of salva tion for Man as Man. It must justify our affirmation that the very fact of being human means that Man has the real possibility of attaining the end proper to him. This end—however we may characterize it—is what we have called salvation. Evidently, this 'something' cannot belong to the purely doctrinal order since the world of concepts depends upon the possibilities offered by the different cultures through which it is expressed. In fact there is no universal culture in either time or space. And a concept is meaningful, and hence valid, only where it has been conceived. This fundamental 'something' we seek can only be found as a constitutive dimension rooted in the very existence of Man. Our task is to try to describe it, and we say 'describe' because, in speaking of a</page><page sequence="10">Raimon Panikkar / 43 fundamental human dimension, we lack any external overview for a rigorous definition. We could describe faith as existential openness toward transcend ence or, if this seems too loaded, more simply as existential openness. This openness implies a bottomless capacity to be filled without closing. Were it to close, it would cease to be faith. The openness is always to a plus ultra, to an ever farther, which we may call transcen dence and in a certain sense transcendental. One is open to what one is not or, rather, to what one has not yet become. Real openness means the possibility of being: openness to Being. It implies a capacity to be ever more and more filled, an 'in-finite' receptivity, because Man is not 'finished', finite. Man is open because he is not closed, he is not complete because he is itinerant, not definite, not 'finished', incomplete. The existential openness of faith represents Man's capacity for his non-finitude, that is, his in-finity. No person considers himself as finished, as having exhausted the possibilities of becoming. The opening of which we speak is constitu tive of the human being, the other side of what we call contingency. This latter appears when we look backwards, to our foundation, thus discovering that we do not have in and of ourselves the ground of our own existence. The former, i.e., the existential opening, appears when we look forward, towards the goal, the end, the transcendent, etc., and discover that we are not complete. We should not affirm a priori that all religions say the same. An important branch of the buddhist tradition will object to the language I have just used. And in fact the buddhist insight obliges us to go a step further, towards a kind of metaontology. Hardly any other religious tradition has more forcefully underscored the fact that we are not, so much so that it will say that we should not surreptitiously intercalate a 'yet'. The way to nirvana implies precisely the total openness without qualification. Recognizing Man's openness means admitting he is not God, not finished, absolute, definitive. It means admitting there is something in him that may grow. The openness of faith is Man's capacity to proceed towards his fullness. This openness is not primordially a capacity of the intelligence as the faculty of the infinite, but rather an openness we call existential to indicate that it does not exclusively belong to the realms of intellect or</page><page sequence="11">44 / Faith: a constitutive human dimension will, but to a prior level given in the very existence of Man. Only the naked existential order, previous to intellect and will, offers the desired universality. Thanks to this dimension of faith, Man recognizes that he is not finished, he needs completion; better, he needs definite aid to attain the goal. Thanks to faith, Man discovers his indigence. Faith is precise ly the base underpinning both human precariousness and the pos sibility of overcoming it. Further, Man's grandeur and his supreme dignity are expressed by faith, since its existential openness does not signify merely need but complementarily indicates an unlimited capacity for growth. Finally it represents a much firmer foundation than human autonomy or self- sufficiency, and expresses the supreme ontic richness possible; we recognize that no 'human' or limited value whatsoever can fill it. Existential anxiety, modern gnoseological atheism and certain social ideologies today are various manifestations of this fundamental attitude of faith that is not satisfied with anything closed, limited, finished. Human dignity resides precisely in the anthropological dimension of faith: Man is an ever open, infinite being. Faith is the foundation of freedom. Without faith Man would not, could not be free; he would have neither the constitutive ambiguity that permits decision, nor the spontaneity necessary for the human act to go beyond—not against—the dialectical possibilities given in the data. True freedom does not consist in manipulating possibilities but in creating them. The openness of faith is a constitutive openness. It cannot be closed; it is finite, neither limited nor limitable. Faith is like a hole in the human being that is never filled, saturated, or turned into a kind of substantivity that would represent the supreme religious blas phemy and sever Man from any relation with the infinite. Through this hole he reaches the infinite (cf. sunyata). It is essential to faith to be a powerless capacity, an ontological thirst that cannot be quenched, an anthropological aspiration that cannot be satisfied and that—if it could—would annihilate Man by destroying this constitutive tension that thrusts him ever toward the Absolute (whatever we call it: God, nothing, Man, society, future). Faith is constitutive of humanity's itinerant condition.</page><page sequence="12">Raimon Panikkar / 45 Faith relates to Man's inquisitive structure. He asks because he does not know yet, but—and this makes him truly an inquiring being—he also asks because he knows that he does not know yet and because he knows that in knowing he will obtain not only the answer but that on which the answer is based. The question also provides the frame within which the answer can appear as an answer: Ontically the answer is contained in the question. The question, then, is nothing other than the ontological condition for the answer. Consequently every question is an inquiry about God and Man. No question ever obtains an adequate response, since at bottom every question is about the infinite. We speak, of course, of human questioning and not of mere asking for information. Each authentic question is a human incursion into nothingness.15 Until now more philosophical importance has been given to the ontological than to the ontic and, as a result, faith has been considered a response rather than a question. According to this understanding, faith belongs to those who give the correct (doctrinal) answers or those who at least act morally. The essence of faith seems to me to lie in the question rather than in the answer, in the inquisitive stance, in the desire rather than in the concrete response one gives. Faith is more the existential 'container' than the intellectual content of 'that thing' we try to describe. It belongs not only to those who respond correctly, but to all who authentically seek, desire, love, wish—to those of 'good will'. The proper realm of faith is orthopraxis, the right actions Men believe they must perform in order to be what they believe they must be. We have, moreover, distinguished between faith and the act of faith. The latter is the free response to faith, is Man's reaction to this capacity that instills in him the thirst for the Absolute; it is his decision to respond to the possibilities presented him in daily life or in the particularly serious moments of his existence. If faith is an existential opening, a vital questioning, the act of faith is equally an existential response. It is, however, part of the perfection of the act of faith that it also possesses an intellectual and volitional aspect. The human response to the thirst for perfection, the desire for transcendence, the free reaction to what several schools see as an appeal from transcendence—this constitutes the act of faith. Everybody 'has' faith, every human being is endowed with this constitutive dimension; but no one is forced to live ex fide, out of faith</page><page sequence="13">46 / Faith: a constitutive human dimension or from faith. Such a life characterizes the 'just Man'. In other words faith is not the act of faith; the latter can be positive or negative and of different degrees of purity and intensity. Our conception of faith does not imply that Man cannot 'sin' against it or perform a negative act of faith, but these are aspects of the problematic we do not need to investigate further here.16 □ This article is an abridged and partial version of a study of the author published in french in 1966 and in english in 1979.
