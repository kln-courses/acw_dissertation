<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vladimir Mayakovsky By HELEN MUCHNIC IN an obituary on Alexander Blok, Mayakovsky recalled a meeting he had had with him during the first days of the Revolution: "I passed by the thin, bent figure of a soldier warm- ing himself by a bonfire .... Somebody called me. It was Blok ... I asked him: 'Do you like it?' - 'It's very good (Khorosho),' said Blok, and then added: 'They've burnt my library in the country.' Well, this 'good' and 'they burned the library' were two feelings about the revolution interwoven in his poem 'The Twelve.' Some read it as a satire on the revolution, others as a glorification of it." This comment on Blok is characteristic of Mayakovsky. A man who bemoaned the loss of his library could not, in his eyes, be wholly on the side of the revolution. To Mayakovsky he seem- ed pathetic, and when some years later he took Blok's khorosho as the title of a long poem, he did so ironically, in pointed con- trast to his own unequivocal endorsement of "1918." Nothing, not even the death of an honored poet, would serve him as reason for unmerited praise. He was honest to the point of brutality. And for Blok's poetry, although he was artist enough to sense its merit, he denounced the school it represented. Symbolism, he said, had had its day; and he sought to demon- strate, in an essay called "How Verses are Made," that his own poetry was better, because it was closer to the spirit of the revolution. Whatever one might think of his estimate, one is bound to accept the fact, for if "The Twelve" is the poem of the Revolution, as it has been called, Mayakovsky is its poet. "The Twelve" was, after all, a feat of translation, in which events 115</page><page sequence="2">The Russian Review foreign to the poet's self were rendered in the language of his private music and the imagery of his private dreams. But Mayakovsky did not need to translate. The language, tone, and purpose of the revolution were his own: the language of the street, the tone of exaltation, the purpose of remaking man and man's society. Unlike Blok, he had not had to overcome dis- taste for public affairs; he had been immersed in them from the beginning. And he had no patience with half measures, with shades of meaning and reflectiveness. He saw life simply, and believed erroneously that he saw it whole. Everything about him was large, loud, and spectacular. Everything was theatre, everything seemed public. He was the voice and the image of Revolutionary Romanticism, and seldom does an age find its embodiment so completely. Yet, on the morning of April 14, 1930, he shot himself. The message that he left, addressed "To Everybody," read in part: "Blame no one for my death, and please don't gossip. The deceased disliked that awfully. Mama, sisters and comrades-forgive me-it's not the right way. (I don't recommend it to others)-but I have no way out. Lila-love me... The verses I began please give the Briks; they will understand." The verses were: "It is past one and you must be in bed. The Milky Way, a silver Oka, lies upon the night. I am in no haste, and with a wire's flash There is no need to wake and trouble you. As they say, the incident is closed, The love-boat has crashed upon day-to-day life. 116</page><page sequence="3">Vladimir Mayakovsky With you we have settled accounts and need not rehearse Mutual sorrows, offenses, and hurts. So long," Vladimir Mayakovsky Why did he kill himself? There had, of course, been disap- pointments. "Like Pushkin before his wedding," writes Shklov- sky, "Mayakovsky sought ordinary ways to happiness: made the acquaintance of young dramatists, watched how they lived," tried to find friends in RAPP, hoped for a woman's love. He had not found the happiness he sought: the young dramatists talked another language, the women he loved did not love him, he had enemies whose criticism amounted to persecution, and he was ill. It is not difficult, in short, to reckon up the circum- stances and occasions, the shoals on which his life had crashed, but they are not the current which had driven it. Certainly it is absurd to think, as some have done, that he "died for love" in the sentimentally romantic sense. The "love-boat" was he him- self, not a love affair. "Men are boats," he had written in his poem on Lenin, using a metaphor inspired perhaps by Le Bateau Ivre: he himself was a vessel of earthy and human love, and the current of his complex nature had carried the boat to its logical doom. The "real reason," of course, can never be fully known. But one cannot help noting the obsession with suicide that recurs persistently in his work. He was lured by the idea, and his eloquent denunciations of it may be due to the power of its attraction for him. This is what prompted Pasternak to speak of "that pedantry with which the will some- times follows a road known to be inevitable." Roman Jakobson, in tracing this suicidal obsession, has point- ed out that a painful sense of the difference between the I and the non-I can be detected throughout his work. And indeed much of his poetry, as well as the conscious effort of his entire life, can be seen as an attempt to get the better of this experi- 117</page><page sequence="4">The Russian Review ence of estrangement. At the end he must have realized that his loneliness was irremediable, and he died, as he lived, with a grim joke about himself and a word of explanation that ex- plained nothing. There is no more tragic poet than he in Russian literature, and it will not do to hold society, nor even individuals, responsible for his tragedy; it was not by his world, but by himself that he felt oppressed, and it is difficult to im- agine any external circumstances that would have brought him happiness. He was endowed with a violence of passion that can be neither satisfied nor subdued, that both sues for sym- pathy and rejects it, that sees the world as too small for it, and strives perpetually to transcend the limitations by which it feels itself hemmed in. He felt himself enormous and unnecessary, and turning self-pity to defiance, forestalled sympathy by mock- ing both himself and others. He craved the dominance of martyrdom, and forced his mind to submit to the dictates of a scheme that claimed all his loyalty. "What would you do," he once asked Aseyev, "if the state decreed that all poetry must be written in iambs?" "I simply couldn't," said Aseyev. "Well," retorted Mayakovsky, "I would write in iambs." Even his earliest poems, impudent and boastful, express deso- lation. "I go and solitary weep that crossroads crucify police- men" may look like surrealist fun, but in the context, where the poet's "trampled soul" is a pavement on which "the soles of madmen stamp the prints of rude, crude words" and "the crook- ed necks" of city towers "have grown cold" in a "cloud's noose," it becomes an image of helplessness. Cities hang, their guard- ians crucified, the poet's soul is in shreds, "the rags of a torn cloud in a burnt out sky," caught "on the rusty cross of a belfry." In a later poem, called "Cheap Sale," he will trade, he says, all that his soul rules over-and its riches are immeasurable-his immortality itself, and all the splendor in which eternity will clothe him, for one kind, human word. And elsewhere he calls himself an ostrich trying to hide its head in the feathers of stanzas, rhymes, and meters. There is a terrible, naked honesty in verses such as this; if they seem fantastic, it is that suffering has twisted reality into images of horror. 118</page><page sequence="5">Vladimir Mayakovsky Of all Russian writers, Gogol was the favorite of his youth. He must have sensed in him his own variety of loneliness, the kind that turned what was not himself into the monstrous, the cruel, and the alien. Like Gogol, he was a humorist, but it can be as truthfully said of him as of Gogol that those who think him funny do not know how to read him. Gogol's laughter, as he himself explained, was the product of despair; he escaped from depression into an imaginary world of absurdity, but he never proclaimed his misery so openly as Mayakovsky, for he had accepted his alienation to this extent at least, that he had no desire to exhibit it. Mayakovsky, on the other hand, instead of fleeing to a never-never land, caricatured his own experience. He remained the central figure of his tragic work, instead of obliterating himself in fantastic tales as Gogol had done. For since he had never fully accepted the difference between the I and the non-I, he wanted to explain himself, and to unite him- self to the world of men and things. There is, of course, this all- important difference between them, that whereas at the heart of Gogol's unhappiness lay a sense of loss and inadequacy, Mayakovsky's self-pity was based on a feeling of power, of an insufficiently appreciated grandeur. His tragedy had in it an element of paradox; it was the inarticulateness of the outspoken, the tragedy of those who seek to relieve pain by trying to ex- plain it, although they know that pain is incommunicable and that when it is past cure, no one can be of help. A cry of pain is without purpose; and much of Mayakovsky's best work is in essence such a cry, disguised though it is as rational protest. He was not clear about himself; and was a mixture of honesty and falsehood, of imperious wilfullness and dependence, of freedom and enslavement. Yet, consciously, he was nothing if not honest. His denunciations of society, of art, of morals and ideas were rooted in a loathing of pretense. It was honesty that made him blunt: the world was crude and ugly, his own ex- perience was bitter; and he despised artists who insisted on sweetness and hated all men who loved comfort of body and ease of mind. There was much in him of the nineteenth cen- tury Russian nihilist, of Turgenev's Bazarov. But he was not so independent as they. He needed people not only for ap- 119</page><page sequence="6">The Russian Review proval but for self-realization, and belonged to the type of rebel whom Albert Camus had called the Dandy, the man who does not know that he exists unless others can serve him as mirrors, who "acts his life, because he is incapable of living," for whom "to be alone is equivalent to being nothing," and who is always obliged to astonish others by negating their values, for he can define himself only by means of opposition. A desperate re- lationship is set up between the Dandy and his public. He demands approval and rejects it at one and the same time; he pleads and he abuses; he declares his love of men but holds them at arm's length. If he is a Rimbaud, his solitude becomes a habit, his scorn of men a principle of integration and a way of life. He has needed an audience up to a point only; he can, when he wishes, step off the boards and lead another kind of life. In a gesture of supreme mockery, he becomes what he despises. But Mayakovsky was always on stage, unable to retire; and all who knew him seem to have been struck by something profoundly discordant between the man himself and his appearance in public: the yellow blouse and the gesture of bravado concealed something they did not understand; the jester's role hinted at tragedy but deterred one from taking the tragic mask seriously. Boris Pasternak has remarked that not content with taking one role, Mayakovsky acted the whole of life and with such careless disdain that his performance was terrifying, and Roman Jakobson has called his poetry "a scenario according to which he acted out the film of his life." The episodes of this scenario are well defined: childhood in Georgia and the revolution of 1905; Moscow with Party work and jail; the beginning of poetry; the "Golgotha" of the Futurist tour; first love; World War; Lila Brik; Revolution; NEP; trips abroad; the death of Lenin; lecture tours, illness, suicide. But both scenario and life were built on a process of mystification, that "playing with reality" which Boris Eichenbaum has shown to be the essence of Gogol's work. When Mayakovsky pictured himself as Man or Poet, as the martyred savior of humanity, or as the sun's comrade, he was indulging in a kind of solemn, baffling joke on the order of his other grotesques: the gruesome images of the 120</page><page sequence="7">Vladimir Mayakovsky bleeding world in "War and the Universe," the huge fantasy of warring objects and the duel of giants in "150,000,000," the pictorial caricature of history and religion in Mystery-Bouffe. All are exaggerations intended to teach a lesson. As pictures they are unambiguous; all is black and white, there are no complexities, there is no shading. But they are jokes. And the theatrical pose was a similarly jesting riddle: on the one hand, a dramatic caricature that told others what they were to think of him, and on the other, a mask that saved him from the necessity of introspection and fooled him into believing that he knew himself. Whatever the motive-pride, vanity, or des- pair-this necessity to conceal lay at the heart of his work, al- though it appeared in the semblance of self-exposure. Negation was the principle of Mayakovsky's life; and parody, which is a form of negation, was something more with him than a favorite trick of art. It was an ingrained habit of thought. His image of himself as a tragic hero was really a parody of the traditional concept of tragedy. From his point of view neither hubris nor hamartia were involved in his situation. Cruelly created to be man by a non-beneficent and non-existent god, he represented the human condition, the flaw of which was due to God, not him; nor could he sin through pride, since no moral sanction was higher than man's, and the deadliest sin, therefore, was not pride but an absence of it, not a challenge of divinity but the relinquishment of effort and ambition to challenge. In his tragic role he was defiant and self-sufficient. He passed judgement on himself, annihilated death, and talked to posterity. But he parodied even his own idea of tragedy when, attempting to achieve something like comic catharsis, he burlesqued his suffering and presented himself as a kind of miles gloriosus simulating absurdly the attributes of gods or nature. He did not manage to obtain what he desired; his performance was gravely earnest, even at its most preposterous; if he "stepped on the throat of his own song" he could not stamp it out, and his ultimate parody of artistic revelation lies in the doubt with which he leaves us as to how much of his clowning he intended to be taken seriously. 121</page><page sequence="8">The Russian Review Ridicule absolved him of cosmic terror, and his anthropomor- phism took rise in the opposite feeling from that which is usually presumed to motivate it. Usually, it would seem, the darker, the less explicable, the more awful an aspect of nature, the more does man seek to humanize it, wishing to diminish his fear of the incomprehensible by seeing it as human. But Mayakovsky's anthropomorphism is either a kind of camaraderie in which man fraternizes with nature, animals, and things, or a ghoulish force that turns what is perfectly familiar into some- thing ominous and sinister. In his use of the pathetic fallacy, it is not nature that responds to man's experience, but man who sympathizes with nature-since in his view of life man is all- encompassing, and nature is part of him, not he of nature. When he wishes to present whatever seems to transcend man's limita- tions,-greater powers, greater achievements than theirs,-he neither elevates the human being to the rank of deity nor invests him with supernatural qualities but, in a way that parodies heroic myth, extends men's capacities within the realm of na- ture and confers earthy status on the superhuman: the stars and planets are his brothers, the universe is an animal, the soul wears a dressing gown, Christ is not God but the Most Ordinary Man; but the future is a place into which man can fly as easily as he can cross the ocean or divert the course of a river; and the completely human Lenin is in himself an era. And yet, although negation was the heart of Mayakovsky's thought, he was not a Satanist of the romantic school who loved denial for its own sake. He loathed assent and had an impera- tive need to assert himself through contradiction, but his nega- tion was not absolute, not like Rimbaud's, for instance. It was provoked by a respect for justice, and was aimed not so much at a transvaluation of values as at a redefinition of men's atti- tudes He censured and blasphemed in the name of right, truth, and independence. Like Rimbaud, he wished to turn habitual concepts upside down, to shock men out of complacency, the stance of opposition was in itself important to him, and he de- lighted in blasphemy. But the blasphemy of Une Saison en Enfer has a suave elegance that Mayakovsky's lacks, for it is the witty statement of a personal experience, of one man's 122</page><page sequence="9">Vladimir Mayakovsky conclusions about human history and human ideals, whereas the parody of Christ and of the Beatitudes in Mystery-Bouffe, for example, or the conclusion of "A Cloud in Trousers," or the sketch of heaven in "About What-About This" are didactic. They are purposefully grotesque, being tools in an ideological battle, not private visions. Mayakovsky and Rimbaud were kindred spirits, but in their most intimate experience they were each other's opposites. Rimbaud thought himself endowed with superhuman qualities which, being man, he was doomed to lose; from his idealistic heights he must come down to earth. Mayakovsky, on the other hand, who held that there was noth- ing greater than to be simply man, felt in himself angelic qualities and powers that transcended the earth. Rimbaud's negation was absolute, because it came of an embittered sense of loss; Mayakovsky's was a tentative first step on his way to the grand affirmation of a universal Utopia. His art was public through and through: in purpose, form, even in process of composition. He seldom composed, pencil in hand, but was always at work. Once his sister ran into him on the street; he waved her off: "Don't interrupt me. I am writing." And once when some one asked him how he worked: "It's this way," he said, "I walk along. And all of a sudden a big desk appears in the air before me. I sit down at it, and start writing." Korney Chukovsky, whom he visited in Kuokala when he was composing "A Cloud in Trousers," has described him at work: "He would sometimes stop, light a cigarette, sink in thought. Sometimes he'd gallop off as if storm driven, leap- ing from stone to stone; but most often he'd walk along like a lunatic, with an uneven stride, spreading wide his enormous legs . . . and never for a moment stopped talking to himself in a concentrated, quiet conversation." Once a poor peasant was terrified into frantic flight, when he saw this creature marching toward him over the dunes. Not only did Mayakovsky write for the street, he wrote in the street; and his verse swings to the rhythm of his stride and bears the accent of his heavy step and the casualness of informal meetings. Loud, determined, staccato, beating with the pulse of the day, there is no intimacy in it, nothing of that "inner life" 123</page><page sequence="10">The Russian Review that Mayakovsky seems to have denied himself for the sake of an audience of which he was always aware. Powerful and defiant, he believed himself free, but never would be, nor could he have said, like Beethoven about his quartets, that he was writing for himself. If he dreamed, he paid no attention to his dreams. Even his surrealist effects were consciously contrived; nothing welled up unasked from the unconscious,-and his visions of the future give the impression of having come not of insight, but of fantastic desire. When from painting the real he passed to the imaginary, he refused to note the transition or admit the irrationality of his visions. Just as he himself had become indistinguishable from the part he had undertaken to play, so hyperbole, which he had originally adopted as an artistic device, came to stand in his mind for reality. His will was stronger than his judgment. His thought was as rhetorical as his style; his poetry, his life, and his reasoning were passion- ate and narrow. An immoderate and violent man, he had no capacity for an- alysis or detachment; he did not criticize, he damned; he did not love, but worshipped; he could hate and despise, but not dislike. He was intransigent in his opinions, and as uncompromising in his relations with himself as with others. He made his reason fight unhappiness, and his public voice shout down the private one. If he confused the two, mistaking ventriloquism for his own speech and, at the last, was stifled by the heroic puppet that masked the man in him, he did not know it. His work was a process of wilfull exclusion, and it is strong by reason of its passion, not its wisdom. Sometimes it seems the poetry of a nihilist Beethoven, without Beethoven's melody or lightness, but with his power to record the grandeur of rebel- lious suffering. And sometimes it reminds one of those primitive sculptures, massive and rough, that seem to express the anguish of a child, helplessly possessed by an overwhelming emotion. His self-analyses indicate a struggle between a sense of his own greatness and his desire to be at one with the masses of men. But he has nothing of that large, generous ease, that undiscrim- inating joy of life which Whitman makes a virtue and the basis of his love of men. 124</page><page sequence="11">Vladimir Mayakovsky Mayakovsky is all tension, striving, willing. He is united with humanity not in feeling, but on principle. The principle is the magnet of his vigorous emotions, and it is therefore passionately argued. A megalomaniac image is made to express the nature of humanity. It was as if a Russian Rimbaud had tried to make himself the Whitman of the proletarian revolution. It is an indication of Mayakovsky's complex and paradoxical nature that he should have combined the characteristics of two such opposite souls as Walt Whitman and Rimbaud. He knew neither English nor French, but Burluk introduced him to Rimbaud and Chukovsky to Whitman whom he was translating; and such was Mayakovsky's feeling for language that he could grasp the texture of even a foreign poet's speech. He offered Chukovsky, for example, valuable suggestions for his Whitman. His own poetry often reminds one of Whitman's. Like his, it is made to be spoken and has a similarly loose, oratorical struc- ture, the long line, the marked, emphatic beat, the calculated crudeness, and there are passages in it which unmistakably echo Whitman. But Whitman's long rhythms are Biblical, Mayakov- sky's re-create the cadence of his own steps. Whitman's praise of man, his exultation in the body, his love of humankind must certainly have appealed to Mayakovsky. Yet, in "150,000,000" he pictures him derisively as "rocking a cradle in imperceptible rhythm" and bearing the highest title which Americans bestow on a poet, "honored smoother of ladies' wrinkles." He was too much of a rebel to tolerate Whitman's open-hearted geniality. Never could he have been a "Good Gray Poet"; and even if like Whitman he loved things and men in the abstract, his feeling for them was not exactly comradely; his pride in them and in himself was too involved in suffering to be joyous; the violence of his love resembled hatred. In his rebelliousness he was closer to Rimbaud. But his was a primal, Promethean revolt that took place in the void and was itself a kind of parody. There was no Zeus for him to defy, and, unlike Rimbaud, he had never believed in the God whom he addressed. His blasphemy was, in effect, a denunciation of men's folly, and a cry of resentment for his own suffering. He addressed himself to a nothingness, a cosmic in- 125</page><page sequence="12">The Russian Review justice that had once been given a name and which men wor- shipped as good, and pitied them for adoring this embodiment of tyranny. He wanted to cure them of error, and to lead them out of torment; and so he courted them in the dual capacity of martyr and jester: if they wished, he would dance for their amusement, or, like Gorky's Danko, would give them his heart as a banner. It was as if, oppressed by his immensity, he could be at ease only on the stage, where he tried to make himself intelligible by pretending to be grotesque. There he had pos- tured, a lonely giant, unconscious of the irony that made the role he played more tragic than he realized. He addressed himself to large crowds, talked to the masses in their own lan- guage, all Russia knew him. Yet these people were not his real audience. The real one he invented, imaginatively transforming the men before him into a concept of Humanity. And even as he served the needs of the moment among actual people in a given place, he was shouting to the future through the void of his crowded auditoriums. He neither saw nor knew the men for whom he wished to sacrifice himself. It was as if through some metamorphosis Prometheus had become Narcissus; instead of bringing men fire, Mayakovsky was himself consumed, and what he saw before him was not, as he thought, the men he had endowed with their most precious possession, but his own flaming image. He had made himself all will, and gloried in self-immolation; and there is a dreadful logic in his progress up to his final asser- tion of supreme self-mastery and freedom, when, having as- sembled his life work for all to see, he died at thirty-seven, at the same age as Pushkin, and also in a kind of duel. He had managed by means of enormous labor-it was labor he boasted of, not inspiration-to create a Socialist Art. He was proud of it, and like the god of the Deists, having done his work and seen that it was good, retreated from it, sure of its survival. As artist, Mayakovsky was the opposite of the Shakespeare once described by Coleridge, as one who "first studied patiently, meditated deeply, understood minutely, till knowledge, become habitual and intuitive, wedded itself to his habitual feelings." Mayakovsky had respect for neither meditation nor patience. 126</page><page sequence="13">Vladimir Mayakovsky Instead of study and minute understanding, he pounced on events and molded them in the roughly hewn formulas of rea- son-masked prejudice. Nevertheless, his loud rhetoric, inflated imagery, propagandist simplifications, his broken rhythms, and brutal words achieve aesthetic wholeness, because they contain in themselves their reason for being. There is grandeur in them, and the strength of immediacy, the sense, that is, of something lived, not borrowed from talk about life. They express the upheaval, wilfullness, and negation, which are the mark of his day; and neither the bold, bright way he used the language of the street, nor the raw agony of his impassioned love, nor his crude but pointed wit are likely to be soon forgotten. His limitations are the limitations of the revolutionary temper, and more than a revolutionist Mayakovsky never claimed nor desired to be. When from rebel he passed to revolutionary, he changed from outlaw to architect, acquired, that is, a plan for action and a social purpose. But a revolutionary can have no truck with either sentiment or metaphysics. Mayakovsky could not have accepted that "anguish" and "absurdity" which Exis- tentialists have announced to be man's "condition." The revo- lutionary deals briefly with such matters: he cuts the Gordian knot of man's predicament, and gives the rope to the hangman. He might discover that he cannot jump out of his heart, but he also knows that it is in his power to make the heart stop beating. This assumption of a defiant fortitude compels him to the great- est effort of which he is capable, and making a virtue of extreme positions, leads to fanaticism and martyrdom. There is hardly a better example of it than the achievement of Vladimir Maya- kovsky and his real tragedy. 127</page></plain_text>
