<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Revised Pages Chapter 6 Performing Phonographic Physiology James Emmott ••• In January and February 1854, the German scholar Chevalier Bunsen  convened a group of leading philologists and phoneticians for a series  of “Alphabetic Conferences” at his ambassadorial residence in London.  The group focused on a difficult linguistic problem that had exercised  individuals for centuries: how to identify and arrange human speech  sounds in a new symbolic system that would be universally usable across  all the languages of the world. The potential of such a system had become  increasingly clear for a rapidly globalizing nineteenth century. It would  meet a scientific need by offering insight into the sound relations of  diverse languages and the mechanism of speech; it would meet a practi- cal need with its promise that a new dawn of intercultural conversation  was at hand, galvanized by a parallel explosion in communications tech- nologies that seemed tantalizingly ready to offer intermediary assistance.  To achieve this goal, it would first be necessary to move beyond con- ventional alphabets. It had long been recognized that the relations of  spelling to speech were both arbitrary and maddeningly inconsistent—  the same sound could be expressed by multiple combinations of letters,  and multiple sounds could share identical orthographic formulations.  The learned experts gathered for the conferences in London directed  their efforts toward the exhaustive collation of the ways in which speech  sounds were rendered in existing alphabets, in the hope that these might  125 </page> <page sequence="2"> Revised Pages 126  •   strange science be refined and reconfigured in novel, complex combinations. Yet for  those who were most sensitive to the range of vocal variations within and  between languages, it was evident that conventional systems of spelling  would not be capable of adequately representing them. At this historical moment, decades before the appearance of the inven- tion that decisively took the name in 1877, the word “phonography” (lit- erally “sound- writing”) designated a variety of practices and techniques  that sought to fix and transcribe intangible vocal sounds into recorded  forms. The previous quarter-c entury had seen the gradual development  of elocutionism, or vocal training, into what was now becoming called  vocal science. The two major influences on the field in this period had  issued from the late eighteenth- century writings of Thomas Sheridan  and John Walker. Each had promoted different techniques: Sheridan  thought that the ideally trained voice was one that advanced toward the  purity of natural laws, whereas Walker was committed to identifying the  mechanical processes involved in the physiology of vocal production and  devising annotations to describe them. The latter method was to inform  the so- called mechanical school, which went on to become largely ascen- dant at midcentury. Among the most prominent of its adherents was the  Scottish elocutionist Alexander Melville Bell, the son of Alexander Bell  (a well- known vocal teacher in London and the author of a series of pop- ular guides earlier in the century). Melville Bell’s own phonetic system,  Visible Speech, published in book form in 1867, was one of the major  debts of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) in the late 1880s,  which, based on physiological principles, marks the consolidation of the  mechanical approach that defined modern vocal science.1 In this chapter, I argue that Bell’s idiosyncratic but highly influential  version of physiological phonetics can help us see more clearly how— in  the years just before the appearance of Edison’s invention—t he human  body was already being figured in phonographic terms: as an apparatus,  increasingly understood mechanically, that records received stimuli and  replays them as performed behaviors. In doing so, I show how the fields  of physiology, phonetics, and phonography are mutually determined in  the 1860s and 1870s, and how each draws on a shared understanding  of articulatory performance in accounting for the ways that multiple,  sustained impressions and movements record their accumulated traces  in the fabric of bodies also furnished with the capacity to replay them.  In making the case for connecting vocal physiology with the new mean- ings of phonography, I examine the development and implementation  of Bell’s Visible Speech, and then move on to recover two aspects of its  </page> <page sequence="3"> Revised Pages Performing Phonographic Physiology  •   127 broader contextual constellation: first, a sequence of discourses on phys- iological memory that attended the emergence of the phonograph, and  second, the retrospective foil offered by Bernard Shaw’s 1912 play Pyg- malion, whose wry satire on the phonetic culture of the late nineteenth  century not only contains a profusion of phonographic metaphors, but  also registers some discomfort with the disquietingly implicit agenda of  such vocal pedagogy to “humanize” its subjects. Visible Speech In The Principles of Elocution (1878), appearing in its fourth revised and  expanded edition as the phonograph emerged into the consciousness  of the world, Alexander Melville Bell maintained that “speech is wholly  conventional in its expressiveness, and mechanical in its processes.”2 Elo- cution, he held, “must embrace the Physiology of Speech— the mechan- ics of vocalization and articulation,” its mastery relying upon learning  what Bell called the “principles of Instrumentation.” A student “should  be made acquainted with the instrument of Speech as an instrument, that  all its parts may be under his control, as the stops, the keys, the pedals,  and the bellows, are subject to the organist.”3 It had taken him some  time to reach this position. Following the 1854 conferences, Bell had  looked on as a series of attempts toward a “universal alphabetics” had  fallen short of ideal completeness. He was an articulate enthusiast of the  cause, explaining in a lecture to the Society of Arts in March 1866 that  “a system of letters which, when learned in connection with any one lan- guage, would be vocalised with uniformity in every other language, has  long been felt to be one of the great wants of the world.”4 His approach  to the problem was distinctive. He reported that he had alighted on an  alternative method, one that avoided the “insuperable obstacles” that  had hitherto stalled others’ progress. Unlike them, he explained, I worked from different data, and by a totally different process. . . .  Instead of going to languages to discover the elements of utterance,  I went to the apparatus of speech, and, after many partial failures,  but with gradual approximations to success, during a long series of  years, I had the satisfaction ultimately of discovering, with demon- strable certainty, the complete physiological basis of speech, and of  establishing an organic scale of sounds which could not but include  all varieties, known and unknown.5 </page> <page sequence="4"> Revised Pages 128  •   strange science In contrast to the effort to collate existing orthographic symbols into a  new universal system, Bell’s goal was “to discover, from the organs of speech,  all the modifications of which they were susceptible.” From this system- atization of the elements of vocal physiology, Bell suggested that “all pos- sible shades of sound might be gathered, and every alphabetic variety in  languages might certainly be found and recognized.”6 Since its symbols were devised as visual analogues of the vocal organs  that formed this variety of sounds, Bell named his new alphabet Visible  Speech. “All writing may be said to be, in a sense, visible speech; that is,  it is a visible record of conventional language,” he explained in a lecture  on the subject, “but the system of Visible Speech is physiological, and  records the actions of the mouth, irrespective of any particular employ- ment of them.”7 Bell’s system would record not the arbitrary shapes of  traditional letters, whose transformation into spoken utterance depend- ed on often illogical conventions, but rather the “actions of the mouth,”  in symbols that reflected the physiological arrangement required for a  given speech sound— the lips open or closed, the soft palate depressed  just so, the passage of air through the nose, and so on. The idea was  that any suitably trained person who followed the directions to repro- duce those actions would find that the vocal sounds associated with them  would follow automatically. “Whatever the mouth can do, you can write,”  Bell declared, “and whatever you write, any student of the system can  read—t o whatever language the written matter may belong.”8 Visible Speech could be described as a universal alphabet because it  claimed to enumerate and symbolize every sound, linguistic and non- linguistic, that the vocal organs themselves were theoretically capable  of producing. Where a sound required the simultaneous operation of  more than one elementary action, the symbols were gathered into com- pounds, allowing even the most complicated sounds to be represented.  The special distinction of Visible Speech, retained in modern- day pho- netics, was therefore that every part of a symbol expresses a physiologi- cally and phonetically meaningful feature, in contrast (for instance)  to Roman script, which is littered with redundant, meaningless details  (such as the extension of stalks above and below the general line, in  b and g). Visible Speech claimed to hold the universal key to the rep- resentation of all vocal sounds. This remarkable aspect of its typology  permitted its further description as a “self- interpreting” system, which  connected the whole taxonomy of phonetic representations directly to  the physiology of the human voice— a symbolically complete metalan- guage. It was a system of spelling sound that even in the middle decades  </page> <page sequence="5"> Revised Pages Performing Phonographic Physiology  •   129 of the nineteenth century would have been readily understood as pho- nographic. The extensive promise of Visible Speech as a technique of  sound- writing is reflected in the testimony of a contemporary: A full sneeze, for example, is a complex operation: it comes among  what are called inarticulate sounds; but Mr Bell writes it down, and,  for aught we know, could undertake to furnish every member of the  House of Commons with a symbol representative of his own particu- lar sneeze, as distinguished from those of all his colleagues.9 In Bell’s system, these transcriptions had a dual purpose or possibility,  for they enabled not only the capture of vocal phenomena, but also the  reproduction (through phonetic rearticulation) of what had been tran- scribed. Indeed, it was in this sense that Visible Speech moved beyond  the symbolic to the properly indexical: its characters did not just repre- sent, they also self- interpreted; they did not merely record the general,  but replayed the particular. The identification of the physiological components of vocal sounds  with the mode of their mechanical reproduction had previously only  been approximated, with the use of speaking machines— a special vari- ety of a wider tradition of automata dating back several centuries that  were contrived to replicate a range of physiological processes, from eat- ing and drinking to the workings of the circulatory system. As Thomas  L. Hankins and Robert J. Silverman have shown, speaking machines  emerged from the work of phoneticians, elocutionists, and stenogra- phers who were concerned with rendering their investigations more  objective. For them, such a machine might “serve as a standard for pro- nunciation; it could help to analyze speech sounds into their phonetic  components; and it could aid in forming a truly phonetic shorthand,  because a phonetic sound could correspond to a unique arrangement  of [its] elements.”10 The English phonetician Alexander John Ellis was  an influential advocate of this approach, observing in his 1845 book  Alphabet of Nature that “it is impossible that any person in analysing  sounds can do more than analyse his own sensations”; since these “may  never occur in any other individual,” it cannot be done “without the  aid of a machine.”11 By contrast, Bell believed that he had indeed dis- tinguished objectively a complete and universal set of dispositions.  In describing the human vocal apparatus figuratively as a “speaking  machine” in his first published version of Visible Speech in 1867, Bell  was saying more than he may have realized—f or in rendering an actual  </page> <page sequence="6"> Revised Pages 130  •   strange science machine unnecessary for the task, he had figured the body itself as  one.12 The ideal student of Visible Speech commanded the physiologi- cal knowledge to replay in bodily actions the sounds that the system  had recorded in its phonetic transcript. Bell used a series of “public experiments in the Writing of Languages”  to stage the performance and display of the phonographic capacities he  had identified. The demonstrations involved Bell’s training of his sons  to acquire mastery of the system— accomplished, he claimed, in just a  few days—s uch that they were “enabled to pronounce, at sight, the most  difficult and peculiar words that could be selected from the Eastern and  other Languages; often involving combinations of sound which the read- ers had never heard before their own organs gave them utterance.”13 In  a published letter to the journal Reader, Ellis himself gave an account of  one such occasion conducted in London in the spring of 1864. Bell’s  sons, with no advance knowledge of the details of the challenge about to  be posed to them, were sent out of the room, while Ellis “dictated slowly  and distinctly the sounds which I wished to be written.” As an expert in  phonetics, Ellis clearly reveled in devising ingenious ways to test the sys- tem’s limits. The sounds he dictated to Bell consisted of a few words in Latin, pronounced first as at Eton, then  as in Italy, and then according to some theoretical notions of how the  Latins might have uttered them. Then came some English provincial- isms and affected pronunciations, the words “how odd” being given  in several distinct ways. Suddenly German provincialisms were intro- duced. Then discriminations of sounds often confused, as ees, is’ (Pol- ish), eesh, ich (German), ich (Dutch), ich (Swiss), ouï, oui (French), we  (English), wie (German), vie (French). Some Arabic, some Cockney-  English with an introduced Arabic guttural, some mispronounced  Spanish, and a variety of shades of vowels and diphthongs.14 Ellis explained his choices by noting that “the sudden changes and the  confusion would utterly prevent anyone from guessing by the context,”  and that the particular distinctions between vowel sounds that he had  deployed “would be very difficult either to seize or to imitate except  by persons thoroughly used to appreciate [sic] such sounds, or led by  a strictly physiological system of symbolization to conceive and utter  them.”15 Visible Speech was claimed to be just such a system, and accord- ing to Ellis’s account, it worked. Having transcribed the sounds into the  symbols of Visible Speech, Bell recalled his sons to the room, and they  </page> <page sequence="7"> Revised Pages Performing Phonographic Physiology  •   131 articulated them according to the instructions. “The result was perfectly  satisfactory,” Ellis enthused, noting how “Mr. Bell wrote down my queer  and purposely- exaggerated pronunciations and mispronunciations and  delicate distinctions in such a manner that his sons, not having heard  them, so uttered them as to surprise me by the extremely correct echo  of my own voice.” He went on: “I was not satisfied with approximations,  and I obtained correct imitations. Accent, tone, drawl, brevity, indistinc- tiveness, were all reproduced with surprising accuracy.” This was a range  of features that had hitherto eluded conventional methods of sound-  writing, and no such methods had been adequately sophisticated as to  be able to register and reproduce a vocal phenomenon so phonographi- cally indexical that it could be deemed an “echo.” Having studied alpha- betic systems for over twenty years, Ellis did not “know of one which  could have produced the same results,” concluding that “so far, then, as  I am able to judge, Mr. Bell has solved the problem.” He held that the  success of Bell’s technique, appropriate to its name, was secured by a  physiological fidelity that was practically visible: “I could, as it were, trace  the alphabet in the lips of the readers.”16 There were many other staged demonstrations in which the Bells  virtuosically performed the physiological transformation of transcribed  input into perfectly articulated output. In a memoir, Alexander Graham  Bell (the middle in age of the sons) recalled a public lecture at which  members of the audience were “invited to make any sorts of sounds they  desired.” The volunteers called to his father’s platform duly “uttered the  most weird and uncanny noises,” and the young man rendered them all  with exactitude, including an obscure and difficult Sanskrit vowel that  he gave correctly without having heard the sound before, and a “curi- ous rasping noise that was utterly unintelligible” to him, but recognized  at once by the audience as the sound of sawing wood, “which had been  given by an amateur ventriloquist as a test.”17 The method proved so  successful that Melville Bell identified it almost immediately as being  applicable to the teaching of deaf mutes, which was after all the condi- tion into which his sons had effectively placed themselves in the Visible  Speech performances. Since the deaf could not memorize sounds as  heard, the physiological basis of Visible Speech was its peculiar advan- tage: by learning the ways in which the vocal apparatus was configured  and utilized in producing articulations, the practical means for render- ing the full range of vocal sound could be internalized without necessary  auditory reference to the phenomenal sounds themselves. Ellis had actu- ally anticipated this pedagogical development: in a follow- up letter to the  </page> <page sequence="8"> Revised Pages 132  •   strange science Reader in 1865, he had speculated that the successful promulgation of  Bell’s scheme would be secured “by transfusing it into living organisms  which will give his written symbols motion and meaning.”18 Graham Bell began to enact this process of transfusion in the teach- ing that he undertook at Susanna Hull’s school for deaf children in Lon- don in 1868. In a class with two of these young pupils, his biographer  Robert V. Bruce tells us, Bell sketched the profile of a face, including the “insides of the mouth” (as  he explained to the girls by finger spelling). Then he rubbed out all but  the lower lip, the point, front, and back of the tongue, and the glottis.  Those curved lines in their respective facings constituted the Visible  Speech symbols for “back,” “front,” “point,” “lip,” and “voice.”19 By the end of the first lesson, the girls had learned a dozen sounds. The  culmination of the practice, forged in London, followed shortly after the  family’s move overseas. In 1871 Graham Bell undertook a demonstra- tion of the method before an audience of “influential Educationalists”  in Boston, Massachusetts, which he relayed in a letter to his parents. One  of his congenitally deaf pupils, Theresa Dudley, who had also been mute  for most of her life, “read from the symbols words in German, French  and Zulu— introducing clicks.” Bell then “invited the audience to dictate  words in any language. Theresa Dudley did not fail in a solitary instance,”  he reported. “The best of it,” he went on, “is that she does not know  yet that she uttered words at all.” In a further twist, Bell illustrated how  Theresa could “vary the ‘timbre’ of her voice at will”— as he put it, how  she “could inflect it mechanically” under his direction. Following the  motions of Bell’s hand, another pupil, apparently without quite knowing  it, sang first a scale, then a rendition of “God Save the Queen,” and then  a short extract by the eighteenth- century poet Robert Lloyd.20 What is spectacularly revealed in these performances is the Bells’  extraordinary conception of the body as a machine for reproducing  sound. The theory and practice of their phonetic system augmented  transcription with translation, and transformed the static recording of  symbols into active rearticulation by “transfusing” into their subjects  the capacity for the performance of what I have here called “phono- graphic physiology.” The twin processes of translation and articulation,  based on the understanding of the human voice and ear, and made auto- matic by a self-i nterpreting symbolic vocabulary, figures this system as  phonographic (avant la lettre) in the Edisonian— rather than the merely  </page> <page sequence="9"> Revised Pages Performing Phonographic Physiology  •   133 stenographic— sense. In Visible Speech, sounds were not transcribed in  order to preserve them for their own sake, or simply to communicate  textually. Instead, the system aimed at what amounted to physiological  recording and replay. Moreover, as Graham Bell himself keenly observes,  his pupils were practically unaware of their vocal achievements. Like his  own earlier automatic articulations of previously unheard sounds via the  transcribed symbols of Visible Speech, Bell’s pupils performed mechani- cally. Theresa “does not know  .  .  . that she uttered words at all.” The  device that emerged from Edison’s laboratory just a few years later and  which appropriated the term “phonography” was to be a machine whose  operation was similarly mechanical and unconscious. Mechanical Memory The phonograph cylinder worked by revolving while a stylus inscribed  whatever acoustic vibrations put it in motion. When the instrument is  arranged to replay what it has recorded, its stylus indifferently retraces  its path along the grooves it made. Shortly after Edison’s invention had  emerged from his Menlo Park laboratory, the philosopher Jean- Marie  Guyau struck upon the device (as many have similarly struck upon the  latest technology) as an apt metaphor for the working of human mem- ory. In citing approvingly the Belgian physiologist Joseph Delboeuf’s  claim that “the mind is an album of phonographic recordings,” Guyau  suggested in 1880 that just as the “resonances of the voice are trans- ferred to a needle” in the case of the phonograph, it may well be that in a similar way invisible lines are incessantly  engraved into the cells of the brain, lines that constitute the beddings  for the nervous currents. When, after some time, the current happens  to encounter one of these previously formed beds, through which it  has already passed before, it engages itself in them once again. Con- sequently the nervous cells resonate as they did the first time, and this  comparable resonance corresponds psychologically to a sensation or  thought that is similar to the forgotten sensation or thought.21 Guyau’s invocation of vibration in the term “resonance” is not acciden- tal. Delboeuf’s claim emerged from a broader argument proposing, as  Laura Otis puts it, that “memories were changes in patterns of molecular  vibration, just as a stone thrown into a pond affects the wave pattern cre- </page> <page sequence="10"> Revised Pages 134  •   strange science ated on the surface by stones that have been thrown in shortly before  it.”22 Memories, then, are composite phenomena— “accumulated capi- tal” in Delboeuf’s phrase—o riginating in the vibratory properties widely  thought at that time to be fundamental to the nature of physiological  matter. This notion of accumulation is foreshadowed in Herbert Spen- cer’s 1863 Principles of Biology, in which Spencer claims that all physi- ological development is a process of combination and compounding, in  his molecular focus on how the “mutual play of forces . . . produces a dif- ference in the form which the aggregate of them assumes.”23 Spencer’s  notion of aggregation is itself drawn implicitly from the composite form  of multiple vibrations suggested by the metaphor of competing wave pat- terns in water, and the same basic principle is found in the phonograph  groove, which materially sums the vibratory multiplicity of acoustic phe- nomena in a single resultant form. In Delboeuf’s and Guyau’s post-E disonian reflections, the phono- graph provides for them a new physical analogue for a way of thinking  about the connections between physiology, articulation, and memory  that already had been in development for some years before Edison. In  1869, for instance, the British physician H. Charlton Bastian had pub- lished a provocative series of articles addressing the question of what he  called the “physiology of thinking.” Bastian’s premise is that thoughts are  formed and exchanged in language, and that language is fundamentally  an act of articulation. “We may ask then,” he writes, “whether, in using  language as a vehicle for thoughts, words recur or are revived primarily  as ideas of sound, or as revived remembrances of articulatory efforts.  Are they ever, in fact, primarily revived as ‘suppressed articulations’?”24  For Bastian, an instance of language- as- thought is both an acoustic event  and a physiological configuration of the human vocal apparatus. He sug- gests that what we ultimately bring to mind in this process of mental  recurrence or revival is the latter: a memory resides not merely as an  abstract datum, but as written into the very fabric of the body. In terms  later echoed by Guyau, Bastian describes his account of how sensory  impressions “pass along definite routes to certain parts of the cerebral  hemispheres.”25 The recollection of these impressions, he held, revives  “precisely the same parts of the hemispheres” that had been activated by  the original event, and the “same nerve- fibres, and same nerve-c ells” are  “called into activity as were previously concerned in the perception of  the original impression.”26 This automatic theory of muscular memory was explicitly revived lat- er in the century by one Theodate L. Smith, whose article-l ength treatise  </page> <page sequence="11"> Revised Pages Performing Phonographic Physiology  •   135 on the subject returns us to the work of Alexander Graham Bell. Writing  for the American Journal of Psychology in 1896, Smith reports the case of  Edith Thomas, a young pupil of Bell’s (and sometime classmate of Helen  Keller and Laura Bridgman) who had been deaf and blind from the age  of four, and who had become increasingly mute since then. When Edith  was nine years old, Bell tested her abilities to reproduce movements by  means of motor imitation, just as he had done with many other pupils.  Smith reports: She succeeded fairly well, pronouncing the letter K, which offers  peculiar difficulty to deaf mutes, with unusual distinctness. When  asked to repeat the letter some hours later, she called with an almost  perfect enunciation, “Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.” Investigation revealed the  fact that when at the age of four years the gradual loss of speech had  followed that of sight and hearing, the last intelligible word spoken  by the child was “Kitty.” The reproduction was unconscious, the child  having absolutely no idea of what she had done. It was not, then, a  reproduction of the word as heard or associated with something, but of  a muscular movement, which, latent for five years, was recalled by the  suggestion of a similar movement. This incident suggested that pos- sibly, under normal conditions, the muscles play a greater part in our  memories than we are accustomed to assign to them.27 More than thirty years after the original Visible Speech performances  and the associated teaching methodology had been devised, Smith here  endorses the connections that the Bells had intuited between voice,  physiological movement, habit, and memory formation. As he puts it,  “Every teacher has observed children busily moving their tongue and lips  during the memorizing of a lesson,” but they do so, he claims, “without  thinking that the movement was not a mere habit, but a real aid in the  process of memorizing.”28 In Smith’s theoretical model, the physiologi- cally latent store of articulated memories is reactivated by the stimulus of  a vocal action that prompts the muscles and neural fibers, stylus- like, to  retrace their grooves. “You Can Turn Her On as Often as You Like” In her recent book Heart Beats, Catherine Robson has identified the sev- enty or so years from 1875 as the “heyday” of memorization in the peda- </page> <page sequence="12"> Revised Pages 136  •   strange science gogy of poetry in Britain and the United States.29 That this period closely  corresponds to the moment of greatest prominence of the mechanical  school of elocutionary teaching, practiced by Bell and others, is surely  no coincidence. Neither, as Ashley M. Miller and others have shown,  was nineteenth-c entury prosody in general ever far from understandings  of the physiology of memory.30 These contextual affiliations suggest the  importance of a further perspective, unaddressed since the start of this  chapter, on what I have so far discussed. For one of the most significant  mirrorings between memorized recitation and the quest for a univer- sal alphabetics concerns their shared objective of carefully inculcating  (trans)national cultural knowledge by means of physiological transfu- sion, and the implicitly operative trope of “civilization” in the practice  of vocal education. In his 1864 Reader article, Alexander John Ellis had  expressed his optimism that the emergence of a truly universal alpha- bet would collapse cultural borders and divisions and “rapidly become a  great social and political engine.”31 This was a radical goal enthusiastical- ly shared by the dramatist Bernard Shaw, himself a keen phonetic writ- ing aficionado. His 1912 play Pygmalion, to which I will now turn, points  toward some of the conflicted consequences of this proposed engine of  transformation. Pygmalion, which Shaw had devised as early as 1897, returns us to the  culture of late nineteenth- century phonetic science.32 The background  to the play is well known, but certain aspects of its provenance are worthy  of remark in establishing a relation with Melville Bell’s Visible Speech.  To begin with, Shaw had connections to Bell through the latter’s nephew  Chichester, who seems to have been responsible for passing to Shaw a  copy of his grandfather’s 1847 play The Bride, in which the valet Allplace  is introduced as having been taken into the family of the unremarkable  aristocrat Sir Cicero Pandect for the purpose of instructing him in prop- er manners.33 The central theme of transformation bears a close resem- blance to Pygmalion, and is just one signal of the considerable affinities,  formal and informal, between Shaw and the Bell family. Bell is named  as a “hero” in the preface, and the playwright was surely aware that Mel- ville Bell’s wife (who was deaf) was named Eliza. Shaw himself learned  Visible Speech in the 1870s, and Pygmalion, titled “The Phonetic Play”  in the original manuscript, was drafted in Pitman shorthand—t he curi- ous concern with phonetics and phonography manifesting itself in both  form and content. The male protagonist Higgins (capable, he absurdly  claims, of pronouncing 130 distinct vowel sounds) reflects some com- posite of phoneticians stretching from Bell to Henry Sweet to Daniel  </page> <page sequence="13"> Revised Pages Performing Phonographic Physiology  •   137 Jones, among others (Sweet’s own system, Broad Romic, was another  of the crucial developmental steps on the path toward the codification  of the IPA).34 Most significant of all, in Pygmalion—a  text suffused with  the imagery of recording and refashioning— Shaw realizes the process of  voice training as a series of performances of writing and reading sound. In the play, even before the introduction of Eliza, Shaw presents Hig- gins as someone deeply invested in the performative power of phonetics,  but whose interest is marked by extreme emotional detachment. As the  play opens, Higgins sits under the shelter of a church portico in Cov- ent Garden, surreptitiously recording the varied diction of the people  around him, arousing the suspicions of a crowd. To defend himself,  Higgins enthusiastically casts himself in the role of scientific perform- er. Turning his observations into a form of variety entertainment, he  responds to each bystander’s spoken objections in turn, gleefully identi- fying their place of birth: Selsey, Lisson Grove, Hoxton. He is quizzed on  his method by an onlooker: The Gentleman [Pickering]. How do you do it, if I may ask? The Note Taker [Higgins]. Simply phonetics. The science of  speech. Thats my profession: also my hobby. Happy is the man  who can make a living by his hobby! You can spot an Irishman or a  Yorkshireman by his brogue. I can place any man within six miles.  I can place him within two miles in London. Sometimes within  two streets.35 Shaw figures Higgins as an exemplar of a certain variety of scientist  whose obsession with intellectual work precludes authentic engagement  with his fellow humans. Shaw describes him as “heartily, even violently  interested in everything that can be studied as a scientific subject”; con- sequently, he is “careless about himself and other people, including their  feelings.”36 Higgins is of this attitude when he encounters Eliza in the  street, regarding her merely as a scientific object to be examined as he  transcribes and exactly rearticulates her utterances in his own “Universal  Alphabet.”37 He remarks to her that “a woman who utters such depress- ing and disgusting sounds has no right to be anywhere—n o right to  live.” His sense of superiority over her is evident in his assertion that she  must “remember that you are a human being with a soul and the divine  gift of articulate speech: that your native language is the language of  Shakespear [sic] and Milton and The Bible; and dont sit there crooning  like a bilious pigeon.” She responds with an almost indescribable noise  </page> <page sequence="14"> Revised Pages 138  •   strange science (rendered by Shaw as “Ah- ah- ah- ow- ow- ow-o o!”), which is immediately  transcribed phonographically by Higgins and read aloud again by him,  “reproducing her vowels exactly.”38 Presently Eliza appears in Higgins’s Wimpole Street laboratory, a  room arrayed with a variety of phonetic instruments, including a pho- nograph, singing flames, tuning forks, and a “life- size image of half a  human head, shewing in section the vocal organs.”39 Upon her arrival,  Higgins remarks to his collaborator Pickering: This is rather a bit of luck. I’ll shew you how I make records. We’ll  set her talking: and I’ll take it down first in Bell’s Visible Speech;  then in broad Romic; and then we’ll get her on the phonograph so  that you can turn her on as often as you like with the written tran- script before you.40 Higgins’s playful words somewhat conceal the multiple purposes of their  endeavor. The objective is not simply to transfer Eliza’s voice to the pho- nograph so the men can hear her voice at will— either for Higgins to  demonstrate the apparatus to Pickering, or to diagnose what needs “fix- ing” in Eliza’s dialect. Rather, the passage sets up the idea that Eliza must  herself become a phonograph, in its wry anthropomorphic figuration of  her as a recording to be repeatedly examined. At one point Mrs Higgins rebukes the two men, and Higgins’s  response is instructive as to his purpose: Mrs Higgins. You certainly are a pretty pair of babies, playing with  your live doll. Higgins. Playing! The hardest job I ever tackled: make no mistake  about that, mother. But you have no idea how frightfully interesting  it is to take a human being and change her into a quite different  human being by creating a new speech for her.41 For Eliza does not adopt the tones of another voice as a temporary trick.  Her whole person is reshaped, reprogrammed, by the multiple articula- tory impressions that her months- long reeducation involves, until she  is able to repeat “just like a parrot . . . every possible sort of sound that  a human being can make.”42 The process is so closely associated with  phonographic recording and replay that Eliza herself seems to merge  with the apparatus. The creation of a new speech depends on her physi- ological re-c reation, a transformation that is tracked and exhaustively  </page> <page sequence="15"> Revised Pages Performing Phonographic Physiology  •   139 documented, as Higgins notes: “Every week— every day almost— there is  some new change. . . . We keep records of every stage—d ozens of gram- ophone disks and photographs.”43 Her new way of speaking becomes  “unconscious,” because it has been seared permanently into her body—  recalling, perhaps, the etymological origin of the very word “recording”  in the notion of learning by heart. The process of Eliza’s vocal education,  in other words, is not simply social or psychological in an abstract sense,  but material and physiological. In exceeding Higgins’s expectations by  completely mastering the art of articulatory transformation, Eliza func- tions for him as an idealized phonetic machine. In this sense, Pygmalion is very much in keeping with the sculptural  theme of the original myth against which the play is quite deliberately  placed. Yet, for the reasons that I have already suggested in this essay, the  imbrications of phonetic and phonographic culture in the later nine- teenth century offer a further important context for the play that helps it  exceed its Ovidian frame.44 John M. Picker has recently shrewdly situated  Pygmalion in the “trajectory of imaginative representation of the ‘female  talking machine,’” reading through it a web of connections from Edi- son’s 1880s phonographic talking dolls to E. E. Kellett’s 1900 short story  “The New Frankenstein,” which was abridged and republished the fol- lowing year in Pearson’s Magazine as “The Lady Automaton”—a  text that  Philip Klass has similarly suggested may have been a source for Shaw,  with many shared features.45 In closing, I will build on Picker’s argument  that Eliza ultimately eludes Higgins’s controlling grasp in becoming (as  he puts it) “no mere talking machine but an independent speaker who  reveals herself to be the upwardly mobile, self- governed voice of Ediso- nian modernity,” by connecting the emergence of universal alphabet- ics as a practice of vocal education with the claims that Laura Otis has  made in suggesting that the play “parodies [fin de siècle] conversion  narratives, in which miserable creatures are rehumanized and achieve  enlightenment.” For Otis, even as Shaw “challenge[s] the notion that speech distin- guishes people from animals,” he nevertheless depicts the discomforting  process of “transformations [that] cause excruciating pain,” perpetrated  by a scientific protagonist who gives “little thought to how the [crea- tures] will live once they have been transformed.”46 In Pygmalion, Hig- gins oscillates between regarding Eliza as a “creature” and as a fellow  member of his own species, reminding her that access to the human  soul is found only through the physiological and moral enlightenment  of language. Eliza does not become creditably human for Higgins until  </page> <page sequence="16"> Revised Pages 140  •   strange science she is physiologically upgraded to an appropriately refined state by her  vocal education. Later in his career, Graham Bell had become irrevocably associated  with the oralist movement, whose goal was to assimilate deaf people into  society by abolishing the use of signed languages and emphasizing speak- ing and lipreading in their place.47 Bell’s interventions in the field had  an obnoxious (and not, alas, uncommon) eugenic dimension. Jennifer  Esmail has shown how deaf people were seen in the nineteenth century  “as less than fully human,” their linguistic repertoire of visual gestures  compared to the rudimentary vocalizations and gesticulations of mon- keys and apes. The construction of the deaf as biologically inferior led  eugenicist agitators to cast them as a “threat to the ‘fitness’ of the human  race through deaf intermarriage and its potential reproduction of deaf- ness through generations.”48 In such a poisonous culture, it was not  clear how oralist demands could possibly be a help to the process of the  mutual adaptation and negotiation of hearing people with deaf people.  The work that had been notably inaugurated in the theory and prac- tice of Visible Speech led, however circuitously, to a distinctly unpleas- ant destination. The figuring of speechless subjects as “less than fully  human” is implicitly coded in the utopian, normalizing rhetoric that  claimed advancement in civilization and global communication would  be secured by a universal alphabetics, visibly spoken. One contemporary reviewer of Pygmalion, the radical journalist Hen- ry William Massingham, complained that in place of Ovid’s sympathetic  protagonist, Shaw’s “Pygmalion,” Higgins, is “merely a diligent watcher  of a test tube.”49 Yet in figuring Eliza as a scientific object that escapes  her phonetic laboratory, Shaw’s achievement is to sharply ventriloquize  Higgins’s almost inexpressible discomfort at the rapid social transfor- mation that attended the phonetic in his education of Eliza. The satire  becomes most acerbic in Higgins’s scientifically obsessed, “careless” self-  regard, and painfully mocked in the emotional departure of his charge.  The arrogant declaration of his own independence turning to “sud- den humility,” Higgins confesses, with uncharacteristic sentimentality:  “I shall miss you, Eliza.  .  .  . I have learnt something from your idiotic  notions . . . I have grown accustomed to your voice and appearance. I like  them, rather.” Eliza: “Well, you have both of them on your gramophone  and in your book of photographs. When you feel lonely without me, you  can turn the machine on. It’s got no feelings to hurt.” In the wake of this  wounding riposte, Higgins is left to pathetically implore, “I cant turn  your soul on. Leave me those feelings; and you can take away the voice  </page> <page sequence="17"> Revised Pages Performing Phonographic Physiology  •   141 and the face. They are not you.”50 In the end, Eliza is the automaton  turned autonomous, the emancipated fugitive of Higgins’s overbearing  power. One suspects the many students of Visible Speech under the Bells  came to enjoy no such enfranchisement from their ordeals. Conclusion: Physiological Resonance Long ago, in Technics and Civilization, Lewis Mumford diagnosed a pro- found shift in technological development witnessed by the nineteenth  century— a movement away from the enormous machinic scale that dis- tinguished the industrial age, and toward the scale of the human. Since  around 1870, he argued, “The organic has become visible again even  within the mechanical complex,” from which “some of our most charac- teristic mechanical instruments— the telephone, the phonograph, the  motion picture— have grown out of our interest in the human voice and  the human eye and our knowledge of their physiology and anatomy.”51  Mumford’s assertion that underlying such development is “the effort . . .  either to extend the powers of the otherwise unarmed organism, or to  manufacture outside the body a set of conditions more favorable toward  maintaining its equilibrium and ensuring its survival,” has motivated a  whole line of inquiry in the study of media, best encapsulated in Mar- shall McLuhan’s axiomatic notion of the “extensions of man.”52 Recently,  literary critics and cultural historians alike have begun to attend ever  more closely to the ways in which the mechanical and the organic—  so often held apart, even defined as outright opposites— might be seen  more accurately to have long operated in a system of exchange and  feedback.53 For the technological evolution of mechanical contrivances  modeled on organic structures gave rise, in turn, to new and finer under- standings of the mechanics of the body. In this chapter, I have attempted to demonstrate one set of ways in  which such understandings were arrived at. As I have shown, the prolif- eration of inquiry into physiological resonance and auditory vibration in  the period immediately before the appearance of the phonograph—a   mechanical device that depended for its operation on precisely these  principles— converges with a longer lineage of investigation into the  physiological basis of vocal movement and memory. Reading these con- texts alongside the Bell performances and Pygmalion—a  stinging satire  written in the age of the phonograph but illuminating the sometimes  condescending pedagogical culture that preceded it— indicates that the  </page> <page sequence="18"> Revised Pages 142  •   strange science affiliation of the physiological body with a capacity so uniquely cultural  as language was often ethically fraught. Together, these texts and contexts provide some germs of insight into  a mode of thinking in which the mind-body was figured as a read-w rite  device years prior to the emergence of the first technical instrument to  perform such operations. Alexander Melville Bell’s insight and tenacity  in pursuing the development of a phonetic alphabet based not on arbi- trary symbols but on the movements of the human vocal apparatus pre- figures an explosion of physiological inquiry attentive to the performa- tive aspects of the process of memorization. Pygmalion offers a collapsing  of phonetics into the suggestive notions of resculpting and reshaping.  What I have called in this chapter “phonographic physiology” points to  one influential nexus of relations from which the recorded and record- able body emerges as a central and enduringly problematic theme of  modernity.
