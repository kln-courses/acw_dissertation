Paul Streeten Spencertown, New York Sidney Dell's premature death at the age of 71 deprived the interna- tional community of one of its most influential thinkers and spokesmen on development and his many admirers and colleagues of a good friend. He had served in different capacities in the United Nations from its beginning for nearly half a century. He influenced the course of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development under several secretaries-general, Ratil Prebisch, Gamani Corea, and Perez Guerrero. He became assistant administrator of the United Nations Development Programme and executive director of the Centre on Transnational Corporations. Later he became a senior fellow at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, where he contin- ued to advise developing countries and to write articles and books. His first book, Trade Blocs and Common Markets, contains a still highly topical warning against the potential protectionism of common markets among industrial countries. It is a pity that he was not able to finish the history of the social and economic activities of the United Nations, a task for which he would have been superbly qualified. He succeeded in completing the first of a planned multivolume series on the history of the economic activities of the United Nations and had started work on a second volume. Throughout his life he labored in a quiet and determined way to improve the lot of the peoples in the developing countries. In this book he collected some of his articles. The topics, spread over the whole field of international development policies (with debt and adjustment occupying an important place) and over many years, remain of considerable current interest and importance, the treatment is scholarly, and the material is well presented. Dell is a very good Permission to reprint a book review printed in this section may be obtained only from the author.</page><page sequence="2">428 Economic Development and Cultural Change writer and there is a unity of underlying vision. The essays demon- strate that advocacy can be combined with objectivity and scholar- ship. A possible limitation of the collection is that Dell writes as if hardly any criticisms had been made of development aid, of the con- cept of the Third World and the South, or of governments' willingness to act in the interest of their people. The link between special drawing rights (SDRs) and aid has not been discussed for many years. I used to write papers advocating it. Dell wrote in 1971 that "the creation of such a link should ... be considered both as a means of bringing about the adjustment in United States payments needed in the near term and also in order to ensure consistency in the objectives of the industrial countries as a group in the long term." Though this has a contemporary ring, SDRs have become irrelevant (and expensive) and there are bet- ter ways of mobilizing the Japanese current account surpluses (and the U.S. deficit) for development. Dell sees "foreign aid as an expres- sion of international solidarity" (p. 30), without pointing out that the intervention of governments may frustrate this noble objective, turning aid into the transfer of resources from the poor in rich countries to the rich in poor countries. Perhaps these limitations are inevitable in a writer who had to suffer from working under the constraints of the UN bureacracy, however independent and honest his mind and how- ever often he showed his independence, at considerable cost to him- self. Dell's approach to "countries" is anthropomorphic, as if a coun- try represented a single, consistent scale of preferences. It is a professional failing of UN officials, whose constituency consists of governments. Dell will not convince such critics as Nick Eberstadt or Peter Bauer, but perhaps nothing will. The focus on governments and countries is reflected in Dell's view that the 1980s were a decade of retrogression, that achievements were lost, that growth had slowed down or begun to decline (chap. 2 and introduction). In fact, however, average global growth was higher be- tween 1980 and 1989 than in the previous 15 years (3.2% compared with 2.4%). Measuring the benefits by their impact on people rather than countries (surely a more appropriate measure), more people im- proved their position in the 1980s, because China and East, South, and Southeast Asia contain many people and grew rapidly. Three times as many people in the 1980s as in the period 1965-80 (32.2% compared with 10.6%) lived in countries with growth in income per head above 5%. (Within some of these high-growth countries the gap between rich and poor may, however, have widened. Reliable figures do not exist.) It is in Africa and Latin America that regression occurred. It is not the absence of growth but its uneven distribution that characterizes the 1980s. Whereas growth rates of less than 1% were experienced</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 429 by only 13.3% of the world population between 1965 and 1980, this proportion grew to 29.6% between 1980 and 1989. Many of these coun- tries suffered from negative growth rates. Nevertheless, Dell's princi- pal message of chapter 2, the need for policies of world economic expansion, remains valid. Chapter 3 deals with the choice between a basic needs approach and a more comprehensive development strategy. Dell sees the main difference in what he regards as the absolutism of the basic needs approach: that minimum living standards for the poor everywhere have to take priority over all other objectives. As one of the contributors to the basic needs debate in the 1970s, I for one have always opposed such absolutism.' It is true that formal attempts at modeling the basic needs approach invite such absolutism-not until every man, woman, and child has been raised above the poverty line, where basic needs are met, should any other objective be pursued. But this is an indict- ment of formal modeling, not of a sensibly interpreted basic needs approach (I never called it a strategy), which, I always thought, should be one of several components in a more comprehensive strategy. I have also opposed the excessive preoccupation with minimum con- sumption levels, without concern for satisfying working conditions, autonomy, security, self-respect, recognition, freedom, solidarity, cul- tural values, and so forth. I have always opposed the focus on com- modity possession and emphasized opportunities, or what A. K. Sen calls "capabilities."2 But here again, Dell's equation of countries to their governments is evident. "Countries are entitled to define their development needs in terms relevant to their own goals and their own time horizons" (pp. 12, 65). The trouble has too often been a neglect by governments of their poor, both present and future, and the basic needs approach attempts to push them in the direction of doing more. (Dell would regard this as excessively intrusive.) Another criticism that Dell levels at the basic needs approach is that nonbasic needs projects and programs may indirectly help the poor more both now and in the future. But again, many basic needs advocates, myself included, have always emphasized the need to pay attention to indirect ways of meeting basic needs as well as direct ones. So there is really a large area of agreement between Dell's views and those of most basic needs advocates. The great merit of the basic needs writings is to be found in a more fundamental direction. They groped toward an idea that A. K. Sen formulated so elegantly. It had been known that goods are not valued for themselves but for their characteristics and the needs they satisfy. Taking a step beyond this insight, Sen pointed out that the characteristics not only of the commodities but also of the consumers</page><page sequence="4">430 Economic Development and Cultural Change and their environment are important for the satisfaction of needs. More food for an undernourished woman who has parasites in her stomach satisfies the basic needs of the worms, not the woman. It is "capabili- ties" and "functionings" that determine well-being, not goods or their characteristics. Moreover, well-being depends not only on the actual amounts of goods and services consumed or the utility derived from them but also on the freedom to choose alternatives, even if, in fact, the same actual amounts are chosen.3 Chapters 4, 5, and 6 are devoted to international trade (including trade liberalization, regional integration, and services), foreign invest- ment, and the debt crisis. On trade, he castigates the industrial coun- tries for restricting trade but is skeptical of the exhortation to devel- oping countries to liberalize in all conditions. He points to the limited usefulness of the distinction between outward- and inward-looking trade policies, in view of the fact that the former often follow and build on the latter. Dell's view on the debt problem is that common interests between creditors and debtors are more important than conflicts but have not been pursued. The reasons are to be found in the free-rider problem and the Prisoner's Dilemma. First, a debt reduction would lead to increased domestic investment in the debtor countries, both because more resources would become available and because the incentive to invest would be improved. Higher investment would lead to higher growth and this in turn to a larger amount of debt service payments. But although all banks would benefit from such a general debt relief because growth and exports could be resumed by debtor countries, each bank has an incentive to let others make the concessions. Relief by only one or a few means that the remainder of the payments goes to pay interest to those not having made the concessions and thus it frustrates the purpose of the exercise. Each bank has an interest in not giving relief, whether others give relief or not. If it does not give relief while others do, it is a free rider; and if it were to give relief while others do not, it would be a "sucker." If each acts in isolation, the combination of the wish to free ride and the fear of becoming a sucker results in no bank giving relief, which is ranked by all banks lower than all giving relief. Second, after part of the debt has been forgiven by concerted action, multilateral guarantees are needed by governments for the re- maining debt. In this lies the attraction to the creditors to forgive part of the debt by acting in unison. Here again, concerted action by the United States, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the creditor governments, and the debtor governments is needed. Only then can normal lending be resumed. Neither the market nor the uncoordinated actions of governments can bring about this</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 431 solution of the debt problem. Again, it is in the interest of any one government not to guarantee, whether others guarantee or not. Joint, cooperative action is needed. There follows a group of essays dealing with adjustment problems, including the well-known piece "On Being Grandmotherly." (Being nannyish would have been better, for the IMF's behavior does not correspond to that of a stereotypical grandmother, who is overindul- gent. It always seemed to me that the charge against the fund that it behaved like an exploitative imperial governor was unjustified, though the comparison with a Victorian governess is more to the point.) Dell believes that if the origin of a disturbance is domestic, the country concerned should carry the burden of adjustment; if foreign, the burden should fall on the international community or those mem- bers of it who are responsible. Superficially, this is a plausible position. But first, it is often very difficult or impossible to identify the source of the disturbance. Deteriorating prices of export crops, for example, can be said to have their cause abroad if demand has declined, or at home if exporters have not been alert enough to switch to more buoy- ant lines. Inadequate supply of exports can reflect a failure of domestic enterprise or the justified fear that additional supplies would be ex- cluded by higher trade barriers in the industrial countries. Second, there are some domestic origins of disturbances for which the interna- tional community should accept responsibility, such as natural disas- ters (earthquakes, droughts, floods) or man-made disasters (strikes, civil wars, or foreign invasions) and even, in some cases, mistaken government policies; and there are, alternatively, foreign origins of disturbances for which the local government must accept responsibil- ity. They may arise from the inevitable uncertainties of foreign trade, for example, from price increases of imports that are due to growing scarcities, or simply from the unwillingness or inability of the foreign- ers to help. Indeed, it is the purpose of holding foreign exchange re- serves to tide countries over unexpected shocks in their balances of payments, wherever these may arise. The final chapter is concerned with the future of the international monetary system. Monetary arrangements, though not intended to pro- mote resource transfers, can facilitate or hinder development efforts. In the light of Dell's discussion, I would make the following sug- gestions for fund policy: 1. There should be greater symmetry in adjustment policies be- tween surplus and deficit countries. The motto might be, Back to the Future of Bretton Woods (and Keynes)! 2. There should be expansionist rather than deflationary solutions. (Dell reminds us on p. 343 that the elimination or reduction of inflation is not among the purposes of the fund in Article 1. A senior fund</page><page sequence="6">432 Economic Development and Cultural Change official said in my hearing that he regards it as the sole duty of the fund to keep the rise in the general price level to zero.) 3. Help should be given to developing countries to build up liquid- ity. It has been shown that they do know how to use liquid reserves, and do not automatically spend them. 4. The fund should move toward becoming an international lender of last resort and assuming some of the roles of a central bank, such as issuing adequate liquidity. (Dell thinks an international central bank is not feasible while the world consists of sovereign states. To advocate it is to solve the problem by assuming it away [p. 291].) It should lend countercyclically. The opposite is the case now. 5. It should move away from a purely technocratic approach and assess the impact of its policies on people in different circumstances. Criticisms of the fund's conditionality include the following: 1. Devaluation cannot always be implemented (in many African countries inflation restored the old effective exchange rate after deval- uation). 2. Even when devaluation, budgetary and monetary constraint, and so on take place, they are not always effective in restoring balance. 3. Sometimes they are effective only in conjunction with other measures, including nonprice measures and government interventions, ignored by the fund (such as improvements in roads, export credits, marketing facilities, availability of consumer incentive goods for farmers). 4. Even when effective, the costs in terms of undesirable side effects (e.g., unemployment, deteriorating terms of trade, rise in pov- erty) can be very high compared with alternative measures. 5. The IMF is interested in, and targets performance on, means or instruments (devaluation) instead of results (improvement in the balance of payments). It should leave the choice of means to the bor- rower. This would eliminate acrimonious debates even when the fund is right (and frequently it is not) and would achieve the intentions of both creditor and debtor more effectively. 6. The fund's recommendations assume market-clearing equilib- rium. In many developing countries there are large disequilibria in which the result of the recommendations is perverse. Price rises of crops may lead to reduced output if farmers cannot spend their receipts on consumer goods or fertilizer (see Tanzania in the early 1980s). 7. Structural problems (like the oil price increase) are solved by monetary restrictions. It is like the peasants, in one of Charles Lamb's essays, who do not know a better way to roast a pig than to burn down the house. So-called structural adjustments interpreted by the fund (and the World Bank) are too often nonstructural, merely cosmetic, adjustments.</page><page sequence="7">Reviews 433 8. The fund relies on reducing general demand instead of increas- ing supply. 9. The fund does not take a global view, committing the fallacy of aggregation. Not every country can have a surplus. The attempt to do so leads to global deflation. 10. Pressures to adjust are asymmetrical, not on surplus countries, only on deficit countries. The surpluses of the surplus countries should be mobilized for long-term investment on acceptable terms in low- income countries, not eliminated by higher consumption in the indus- trial surplus countries. 11. Fund measures hit the poor and vulnerable (the two are not the same) particularly hard. Unicef has documented this and attempted to change fund policy. The fund has been responsive to new challenges by the creation of the numerous facilities, the high professional caliber of its staff, and its ability to learn from its mistakes, which is admirable but not fast enough. The fund has certainly been beneficial compared with what the situation would have been like without a fund. But one should compare it with the situation with a better fund. Dell repeatedly and rightly emphasizes the need to pay attention to the total relationship between industrial and low-income countries. Restrictive monetary and fiscal policies in advanced countries and their unbalanced trade relations with each other have profound effects on the developing countries. He also criticizes the current fashion of state minimalism and argues that state interventions may be essential to correct for market failures. He has, however, less to say about the role of the state in the sometimes deplorable effects of market success in the face of highly unequal income and asset distributions (e.g., in some famines) or, for that matter, of government success, not in pro- moting public well-being but in capturing resources for its own benefits and those of its supporters.
