<plain_text><page sequence="1">Meat or Vegetables? New Zealand's Literary Sheep and Guthrie-Smith's Tutira Philip Armstrong The Travels of Sir John Mandeville , a popular fourteenth-century travelogue, describes how in the far East 'there groweth a manner of fruit, as though it were gourds. And when they be ripe, men cut them a-two, and men find within a little beast, in flesh, in bone, and blood, as though it were a little lamb without wool. And men eat both the fruit and the beast'.1 This curious organism, variously known as the Barometz or the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, occurs rather differendy in the Talmudic tradition, which describes the lamb attached by its navel to a stem rooted in the earth. Once the lamb consumes all the grass within reach of its tether, the stem withers and the creature dies.2 During the European Enlightenment, when the study of nature provided the crucible for the emergence of modern science, the vegetable lamb became the subject of expert debate. In 1781 the poet-naturalist Erasmus Darwin (grandfather of Charles) envisaged the creature implanted through its legs rather than its navel: Rooted in earth each cloven foot descends, And round and round her flexile neck she bends, [...] Eyes with mute tenderness her distant dam, Or seems to bleat, a vegetable lamb? A century later Henry Lee concluded that both versions of the vegetable lamb derived from European travellers' descriptions of 12</page><page sequence="2">Meat or Vegetables ? the cotton plant, and cited as evidence the words of ancient writers like Herodotus, who referred to trees that 'bear for their fruit fleeces surpassing those of sheep' from which warm clothing could be made.4 Although Lee's explanation has been generally accepted, the story has an interesting antipodean coda. New Zealand, it turns out, has its own species of vegetable lamb. Two in fact: Haastia pulvinarius and Raoulia eximia are endemic alpine mat plants belonging to the daisy family, with cushion-forming leaves densely covered in tawny or grey-white hairs. Lying in clumps a metre or two in diameter amongst rocks and scree, they vividly justify their popular names: vegetable sheep and sheep plant . On first encountering Haastia and Raoulia, Victorian naturalists responded with a characteristic blend of astonishment, calculation and disdain. 'Although singular and interesting to the botanist', wrote John R. Jackson, curator of the Museum at the Royal Gardens in Kew, in 1867, 'these plants are of no value economically, but, on the contrary [...] certain species of them are a plague to the shepherds, inasmuch as they give them much trouble and annoyance to discern between an animal sheep and a vegetable sheep'.5 More than a century later the same confusion recurs in Philip Temple's Beak of the Moon (1980). Temple's novel evokes the anthropomorphised perspective of a young kea, Strongbeak, who while flying home from exile notices that the alpine vegetation has been replaced with pasture, along with other figures he originally mistakes for Haastia or Raoulia. The surfaces of the terraces and flats [...] showed a new greenness, like the scum of algae on a stagnant pool. The tussocks, tematakoura bushes, speargrass and flax had almost entirely gone [...] and dotted everywhere were new plants, like the white tutahuna which cushions bare screes. New plants he thought, until he saw them move.6 A footnote glosses tutahuna as ' Haastia and Raoulia species, commonly known by humans as vegetable sheep'. As we 13</page><page sequence="3">Journal of New Zealand Uterature discover, Strongbeak is mistaken: the kea's range has been taken over by high country farmers and the pastures are full of actual sheep. Yet uncertainty persists over these newcomers. When Highfeather, the authoritarian leader of the kea, suggests compensating for the loss of forage by eating sheep instead, a debate ensues. Since their dietary code prohibits the consumption of flesh, the kea can only justify preying on sheep by classifying them as plants, comparing the sight of their blood with 'berries' (p. 391) and the taste of their meat with 'roots and berries and grass altogether' (p. 326). What is the significance of this blurring, in the case of sheep, of the categorical distinction between fauna and flora? After all, it seems unlikely that Haastia or Raoulia - or for that matter the cotton plant - has often genuinely been mistaken for Ovis aries. Still, these stories about 'oviflora' embody an enduring perception that, when it comes to the border between the animal and plant kingdoms, sheep somehow sit on the fence (or perhaps they sit, as sheep will, hard against the fenceline). This perception, that sheep are somehow both meat and vegetables, derives from the stereotype that they are so passive and docile they approach a vegetative state - which derives in turn from the heavily over-determined symbolic place of Ovis aries in Western cultures.7 In the Judaeo-Christian tradition the sheep has always been, materially and symbolically, the archetypical sacrificial victim and the incarnation of passive surrender. In Genesis the first animal sacrifice occurs when the shepherd Abel, son of Adam and Eve, offers to God the 'firstlings of his flock'. The original 'scapegoat' is actually a sheep: God provides Abraham with 'a ram caught in a thicket by his horns' as a substitute victim for his son Isaac. Ovis remains stuck with this role throughout the Old Testament. Examples include the Passover lambs' blood that preserves the Israelites from the death of the firstborn in Egypt, and the proverbially meek and self-sacrificing 'lamb to the slaughter' foreseen by the prophet Isaiah, who, 'as a sheep before her 14</page><page sequence="4">Meat or Vegetables ? shearers is dumb [...] openeth not his mouth'. These archetypes are taken up in the New Testament, where Jesus becomes 'the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world'. And in both testaments the shepherd's flock provides the symbol of the submission of God's people to his will: the Psalmist sings 'he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand', while St John writes 'he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice'.8 Subsequendy, everywhere in Western cultures, the sheep has remained the epitome and emblem of obedience to the will of God. The medieval bestiarists - writing on parchment made from sheepskin - described Ovis as 'a soft animal with wool, a defenceless body, and a peaceful nature' who 'represents] the innocent and simple among Christians'.9 It is to Judaeo-Christianity, then, that we owe the understanding of sheepishness as self-abnegating passivity, an understanding so deeply inscribed that it remains in force well beyond its religious origins. So, for instance, in Thomas Shadwell's The Virtuoso (1676), which satirises the experiments conducted by members of the Royal Society in the name of the 'New Science', a transfusion of sheep's blood into a man's body produces a rapid change in disposition: '[t]he Patient from being Maniacal, or raging mad, became wholly Ovine or Sheepish; he bleated perpetually, and chew'd the Cud'.10 The same contrast between aggressive energy and pathologically docile sheepishness occurs in H.G. Wells's The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), where the doctor explains why Ovis is not a suitable subject for his project, which is to turn an animal into a human being by means of vivisection: '[t]hese animals without courage, these fear- haunted, pain-driven things, without a spark of pugnacious energy to face torment - they are no good for man-making'.11 The weight of this tradition means that even in New Zealand, despite the unusually high frequency of exposure to real-life sheep, Ovis remains conventionally associated with passivity, vulnerability, docility and sacrifice. Portraying life on her 15</page><page sequence="5">Journal of New Zealand Literature Canterbury sheep run in 1873, Lady Mary Anne Barker introduces a chapter entided 'Our Pets' by distinguishing between dogs, cats, horses and fowls - all of whom possess 'individuality', the capacity necessary for them to be companions of humans - and sheep, who do not: I never heard them spoken of with affection [...]. This must surely arise from their enormous numbers. "How can you be fond of thousands of anything?' said a shepherd once to me, in answer to some sentimental inquiry of mine respecting his feelings towards his flock. That is the fact. There were too many sheep in our 'happy Arcadia' for any body to value or pet them [...]. Even the touching patience of the poor animals beneath the shears, or amid the dust and noise of the yards, was generally despised as stupidity.12 A century later Janet Frame's novel Intensive Care (1970) engages with this stereotype, during a scene in which Tom Livingstone, weighed down by the knowledge that he must soon depart for the trenches of the First World War, stops outside the abattoir on his way to work, gazing at a mob of sheep 'waiting patiendy huddled together' prior to slaughter: As one sheep moved the others rippled in a wave. They were mosdy silent sheep [...] that turned Tom's guilty thoughts of escape to an overpowering gloomy calm, as if he were one of the waiting sheep. He stood watching them. They stared back at him with a nothingness of expression that was worse than plain hostility or pity or curiosity or disdain in that it provided a blank pool for the watcher to sink his own feelings.13 These sheep waiting for death have become nothing but embodiments of subjection to power. Moving only according to the currents of nervous energy passing through the flock, they lack even the capacity for individual autonomous movement that 16</page><page sequence="6">Meat or Vegetables ? typically distinguishes animals from plants. Their silence and absence of facial expression make them - like their forbears whose skins provided parchment for medieval scribes - blank slates for the inscription of human meanings. And like Barker's sheep they possess only one positive quality: they are patient . Janet Frame of all writers would have been sensitive to the connotations of that word, including both its etymological associations with suffering and its significance in the context of clinical medicine - in Frame's work, always an institution of social subjugation.14 Yet there is more here than another rehearsal of the familiar convention of sheepish self-sacrifice. The following clause occurs in the ellipsis in the passage quoted above, just after the description of the animals' silence: csheep were usually complaining, communicating animals, bleating and pushing and struggling' (p. 41). Here, then, in the middle of a passage that epitomises the longstanding association of sheep with passivity, Frame includes an observation that overturns those conventional assumptions. These animals are not blank and patient because they are sheep, but because they are caught in an industrial mechanism so vast and relentless they have lost the will to resist. That, of course, is the real point of connection between the sheep and the human observer in this passage, which does not merely project human meaning onto the animals, but also prompts recognition of shared subjection to a death-dealing industrial modernity. The mournful irony is that, whether or not the reader appreciates this point, Tom misses it: he walks 'abruptly away from the silly sheep' (p. 42). 15 Frame's perspective is unusual here, as it often is. The association, usually contemptuous, of sheep with mindless passivity remains the default setting in New Zealand culture generally. An obvious recent example is the comedy horror film Black Sheep , in which, to quote the tagline, c[a]n experiment in genetic engineering turns harmless sheep into blood-thirsty killers that terrorise a sprawling New Zealand farm'. This might 17</page><page sequence="7">Journal of New Zealand Uterature seem like another departure from the conventional associations of sheepishness: animals so herbivorous they are virtually part of the vegetable kingdom transform into man-eaters, the ultimate in carnivores. But of course the film would never work if the conventional view of sheep were not so well-established in the first place: the filmmakers trust that their audience will laugh at the departure of sheep from their docile and passive typecasting. Something similar was at work in the story of Shrek, a merino wether from Bendigo Station who became a media celebrity after evading muster for six years. Again, Shrek's career might seem to contradict the conventions described above. Yet the whole media event was based on the assumption that Shrek was exceptional because he rose above the vegetative passivity typical of his species, resisted human control, separated himself from his flock and became an individual and hence worthy of respect. At the same time, mockery of Shrek's supposed uniqueness, and intimations of his 'real' sheeply status and proper destiny, were never far from the surface. The shearing of his six -year fleece was broadcast live on national television and, even more oddly, re-enacted two years later on an iceberg off the Otago coast. When television cameras captured Shrek's meeting with Prime Minister Helen Clark on the steps of Parliament, one reporter asked how this photo opportunity compared with the lamb dinner she had served the visiting President of Chile the evening before. Subsequendy, the satire 'Eating Media Lunch screened a story that claimed to break news of Shrek's slaughter, due to 'clerical error', in a 'routine home kill'. 'Secretly obtained footage' showed a merino draped in a red cape emblazoned with the name Shrek, dragged from his flock-mates, slaughtered and skinned, while Jeremy Wells's voiceover parodied the language of media sensation: [T]his afternoon, the stellar career of the world's most recognisable sheep came to an abrupt end [...]. After spending a few final moments with friends, the former 18</page><page sequence="8">Meat or Vegetables ? Prime-Ministerial confidant [was] taken aside and led to a custom-built killing shed. With his trademark jacket still draped round his soon-to-be-slit neck like a superhero's cape [...] under the gaze of our cameras, the maverick merino was martyred.16 Following the broadcast, anxious online discussants asked about the wellbeing of the real Shrek and were assured he was still living in luxury. The point was well made: in the eyes of most New Zealanders Shrek remained indistinguishable from any other merino wether draped in a red cape. We are not accustomed to identifying individual animals from the national flock; nor was there anything that distinguished Shrek from the millions of his conspecifics who are routinely slaughtered, other than a media-created myth that anointed him for special treatment. So it is that, even at moments when our culture entertains the possibility that sheep might have individuality, the next instant most often brings a mocking reversal, a return to the association of sheepishness with mindlessness and vegetative passivity. 'Common sense' brands Ovis aries as the exemplary domestic animal - utterly pliant and disposable, and so taken-for-granted that a flock of sheep can seem part of the landscape, like a patch of gorse or a stand of macrocarpa. Paradoxically, this is one of the reasons sheep are rewarding to think about, since nothing reveals the fundamental structures of a culture better than close examination of its most automatic attitudes - of what it perceives to be 'common sense'. I can think of no better example of a New Zealand text dedicated to going beyond 'common sense' ways of thinking about the nonhuman natural world, and about sheep in particular, than Tutira: A. New Zealand Sheep Station by W.H. Guthrie-Smith. First published in 1921 - although Guthrie- Smith continued to add to it until his death in 1940 - Tutira is the intimate ecological biography of his Hawkes Bay sheep run.17 19</page><page sequence="9">Journal of New Zealand Uterature As Alex Calder has recently observed, Guthrie-Smith's significance as a natural historian rests on his genius for 'noting small things most people would overlook' while 'seeing through to the patterns they suggest'; on his ability to observe familiar things - 'weeds, sheep, sparrows, hillsides' - in a way that 'wrench [es them] free from the blanket of habitual perception' (p. 144). The first eight chapters of Tutira describe the run's geography, topology and geology, establishing Guthrie-Smith's perception of the place as a confederation of lively elemental agencies. His prose, which blends precise scrutiny and metaphorical flamboyance, vigorously brings to life the relationships of rock and soil and water. Materials of different substance and structure - layers, textures, volumes, currents - interact in a multiplicity of processes including earthquake and erosion, slip, sedimentation and subsidence, deluge, deposit, drought and desiccation. The next eight chapters add the stories of Tutira's pre-European inhabitants: the forests and other flora, the avifauna, and a succession of Maori groups. Here again the narrative emphasises interconnection and mutability: the advance and retreat of forests, the welling-up and draining of wetlands, the dialectic of fire and regrowth, the establishment and abandonment of crops and pa, the conquests and defeats of one hapu by another, the spread and diminution of bird species.18 It is not until chapter seventeen, after more than a hundred pages, that the focus moves to the European history of the station. Here - like Mary Anne Barker before him - Guthrie- Smith satirises the blend of Arcadian dream and pecuniary promise that motivated would-be pastoralists to cross the world to New Zealand: For a young man what an ideal existence! - to make a fortune by the delightful labour of your hands - to drain your swamps, to cut tracks over your hills, to fence, to split, to build, to sow seed, to watch your flock 20</page><page sequence="10">Meat or Vegetables ? increase - to note a countryside change under your hands from a wilderness, to read its history in your merinos' eyes. How pastoral! How Arcadian! (p. 135). The very next chapter, 'Hard Times', immediately discredits this mythology. 'The truth is', Guthrie-Smith writes, 'that from the beginning these pioneers were doomed - they were predestined - to failure', because they had not yet acquired 'knowledge of local conditions - the most important knowledge of all' (p. 138). This insignificant-sounding phrase, 'knowledge of local conditions', encapsulates Guthrie-Smith's entire project: to bear witness to the highly specific complexities of the ecology of Tutira, to the run's permeation by innumerable and unpredictable agencies, amongst which the designs of humans comprise no more than a fraction. Indeed at the outset Guthrie- Smith warns the reader that Tutira will treat Homo sapiens 'without fear or favour as a beast of the field'; it will portray the 'acclimatisation' of human beings - 'the stocking of the run with man' - on the same terms as the introduction 'of the weasel or rabbit' (p. vii). Nor is it accidental that the two examples of species coeval to Homo are, in the eyes of the naturalist and farmer respectively, the most destructive. Conversely, Guthrie-Smith everywhere describes nonhuman agents in deliberately anthropomorphic terms. For example he portrays the first steps towards attainment of local knowledge as a kind of colonial reconnaissance undertaken by sheep. '[T]he first action of a mob in a strange enclosure [is] to map it out, to explore it, that is, by lines radiating from established camps'. In this way, over time, the best tracks and crossings are discovered, while treacherous localities, those 'mined with under-runners, blind oozy creeks, cliffs and so forth are avoided'. Just as empires consolidate their acquisition of terrain by the shedding of heroic blood, by the sacrifices of explorers, missionaries and pioneers, Tutira's frontier missions have their ovine martyrs: 'to paraphrase Kipling, by the bones of the sheep of Tutira, Tutira 21</page><page sequence="11">journal of New Zealand Uterature has been made. These early losses were [...] as unavoidable as the mistakes of travellers exploring lands of unknown races of men, of unknown diseases, of unknown climates' (p. 142). Guthrie-Smith employs this anthropomorphic idiom with a persistence and versatility that pushes it beyond the level of mere metaphorical whimsy. He wants the reader to understand the agency possessed by the sheep as a literal, effectual and material force. Hence the tide of the chapter that describes the initial surveying and landscaping of Tutira, 'The Chartographers of the Station', refers once again not to Homo sapiens but to Ovis aries-. 'Pit is sheep that have surveyed Tutira'. Profitable human occupation of Tutira depends and capitalises on the path- breaking agency of the sheep: shepherds access the run via sheep paths, which are cut by the animals and subsequently incorporated into human traffic networks. Forty years after the introduction of sheep to the region their paths 'number hundreds of thousands. From every camp they radiate like roads from a city. They are, in fact, roads from a city, for to sheep their camping-ground is as his town to man, at once a refuge and a resting-place' (p. 180). Not only do the hooves of the sheep cut tracks into the ground, they also build Viaducts', an engineering accomplishment 'dependent upon a multiplicity of special conditions'. In particular locations 'the ancient plateau system of the run, the varying elevation of its existing fragments, its attrition by earthslips and rainstorms' have left ridges or 'junctioning spurs' between 'blocks of higher land'. The sheep walk along these crests on their way to and from their hilltop feeding grounds. They do so habitually because they are merinos, members of 'an easily scared breed' who feel safer 'on the heights'. So the complex of 'special conditions' required for construction of the viaducts includes the composition of the geology, the effects of weather, the temperament peculiar to these animals and the shape of their hooves. These agencies, in cooperation, build causeways at the lowest points of the ridges, 22</page><page sequence="12">Meat or Vegetables, ? as if the little builders were deliberately taking thought of the morrow, scheming to save themselves toil. The tools of the sheep are his toes, his sharp hoofs act as gouges and chisels in the work; rain, sun, and wind, carrying down silt and dust from the heights on either side, supply building material; the centre of the path constantly scooped out is as constantly refilled. Though infinitely slow, there is no cessation in the raising of the little embankment [...] (p. 191). Guthrie-Smith watches the viaducts 'increase, inch by inch, until after forty years their height has risen to a yard and a yard and a half. The finished article, its close-nibbled verdant banks fed with rich dust and silt, is a beautiful bit of animal architecture' (p. 192). In addition to the viaducts, ovine agents can be observed constructing 'sleeping-shelves, ledges built by sheep themselves for their own convenience', as well as 'returfing the naked windblows, hardening the erst-while dangerous fords, drying the bogs and marshes [...], exposing pitfalls and chasms'. In all these ways, 'remodelling the run to suit their peculiar requirements', Tutira's sheep carry out the typical roles by which any colonial society establishes itself: exploration, discovery, surveying, settling, agricultural improvement, civil engineering, public works, architecture and construction (pp. 179; 192-3). At the same time as he emphasises the agency of nonhuman species, Guthrie-Smith underplays or mocks that of humans. For example he describes the mistaken confidence that predestined earlier runholders, along with the younger Guthrie-Smith himself and his friend Cuningham, to failure. Taking possession of Tutira in 1882, the two young men were 'wild with anticipations of sport, of riding, of the mastery of animals' (p. 149). Early attempts to subdue the land relied on a ruthless and self- defeating instrumentalism, illustrated by the deployment of sheep as 'fern-scythes and mowing-machines' for the grazing and crushing of bracken in order to create pasture. Unable to thrive 23</page><page sequence="13">Journal of New Zealand Uterature on this diet, the sheep died in large numbers. With the benefit of hindsight, informed by a more sophisticated comprehension of the interrelationships amongst human, animal and environmental agencies, Guthrie-Smith condemns this mechanistic approach as "'making" the country' by 'murdering the sheep' (p. 139). Even when evoking this earlier phase, however, Guthrie- Smith does not portray the sheep as simply passive victims of murder or instrumentalist exploitation, nor as merely unconscious contributors to environmental change. Instead, here as everywhere else, he characterises Ovis - individually and collectively, at various times and in various ways - as mindful, stubborn, nervous, courageous, determined, impulsive, passionate, sulky, decisive, strongly-possessed of certain tastes and preferences, and accordingly resistant to any kind of human pressure that conflicts with these. So, for example, we are told that '[a]ll sheep suffer from nostalgia, but the merino is perhaps the most miserably home-sick beast on earth' (p. 141). Every new purchase of stock, then, involves a clash of wills, an engagement in 'the long conflict between sheep determined to return to their own pastures and owners determined to hold them on the station' (p. 141). Sometimes the sheep employ passive resistance, for example self-confinement to the point of starvation beside the boundary-line closest to their former home. Guthrie-Smith finds in the diary of his predecessor a 'a note to this effect: "The newly-purchased wethers persist ' - he underlines the word persist - "in lying against the new fence '" (p. 141). Alternatively the sheep rebel against their human oppressors in more active ways, for example the first merinos on Tutira, some of whom hate the place so much that, although swimming is 'distasteful to sheep, and especially to merino sheep', they risk the 'passable though highly dangerous fords' of the Waikoau River (p. 140). The anthropomorphism of Guthrie-Smith's portrayal of his sheep is therefore deliberate and provocative. It is partly designed to undermine faith in the ill-informed stereotypes about sheepishness that I surveyed in the first part of this essay. But 24</page><page sequence="14">Meat or Vegetables'? Guthrie-Smith has a larger project, which is to challenge complacent and anthropocentric assumptions about human mastery over so-called nature in general. In this sense, Tutira can be read as reaching towards something that, in today's thought, would be called a theory of nonhuman agency. Over the last two decades cultural theorists have challenged the assumption that human intentions and actions are the only, or necessarily the most significant, factors that govern events in the world, even (what we think of as) the human world. These theorists have proposed models that recognise the parts played by other actors, including nonhuman organisms (animals, plants, micro-organisms) as well as climatic, chemical, technological and cultural entities. According to these models, events arise from interactions amongst various forms of agency - a word that in this context means simply the capacity to make things happen .19 This paradigm shift makes it possible to speak of the agency of animals (or plants, or other nonhumans) without needing to argue that such agency necessarily involves consciousness, rationality, calculation, deliberation or intention. It also allows consideration of human beings' own unconscious, irrational, automatic, reactive or unintentional behaviours - which are arguably more voluminous and decisive than our considered choices. Thus in Tutira for example, as Calder puts it, 'the role of [human] intention in the historical patterning of events is much reduced', while '[ujnconscious behaviour [...] and unplanned outcomes play a greater role' (p. 148). The misleading anthropocentrism typical of modern thought, which assumes Homo sapiens has rational mastery over the nonhuman organic world, is replaced with a conception of agency as a collective, diverse, multi-dimensional and unpredictable process. Portraying sheep as surveyors, colonists, cartographers, citizens, builders and architects, Guthrie-Smith is working with a theory of networked agency avant la lettre - and this requires him, in the absence of the developments in posthumanist thought and 25</page><page sequence="15">Journal of New Zealand Literature terminology that would occur in the late twentieth century, to rely on self-conscious and ironic anthropomorphism. Tutira also documents extensively the agencies of other introduced species, whose colonial activities interact with - and sometimes reinforce, sometimes undermine - those of human setders. As well as narrating deliberate introductions - by prominent individuals like Sir George Grey, and by the acclimatisation societies established for that purpose - Guthrie- Smith gives detailed histories of unintended introductions and accidental effects of intended ones. His most animated writing occurs when he describes the unforeseeable interactions that redirect the itineraries of introduced species: the migration of rabbits to Tutira following 'the same general line' as the first red deer stag forty years earlier (p. 338); the entry of the mason fly 'in chinks and knots of Australian lumber' and of the black cricket 'either in matting from the islands, or in the bedding of troops from India'; the arrival of minahs accompanying the road- building crews, and of hedgehogs, leaving a trail of squashed martyrs, along the roads themselves (pp. 340, 346, 352-3, 359- 60). Sometimes the movements of species directly reverse the logic of planned acclimatisation: insofar as mustelids were introduced to combat the rabbit population, Guthrie-Smith finds it ironic 'that the weasel should have arrived on the station before the rabbit [...] - that the cure, in fact, should have preceded the disease' (p. 355). Determined to focus his reader's attention on all the forms of lively agency at work beyond the human, Guthrie-Smith portrays the botanical domain as no less vigorous and active than the zoological. If we think of 'the colonisation by England of the temperate regions of the globe as for the benefit of her citizens alone', writes Guthrie-Smith, we overlook the 'scores of tribes of smaller living things [...] whose desire to multiply, whose lust for land, is quite as keen as that of man himself. 'In the wake of our sailors, explorers, soldiers, and pioneers, they steal unnoticed, unobserved. The proverbial sun that never sets on the flag never 26</page><page sequence="16">Meat or Vegetables ? sets on the chickweed, groundsel, dandelion, and veronicas that grow in every British garden and on every British garden-path' (p. 236). Evoking the land-grabbing opportunism of weeds, Guthrie-Smith opens up a large new perspective on the history of migration - one that, as the environmental philosopher William Cronon points out, anticipates and influences later works like Alfred Crosby's Ecological Imperialism .20 Here, again, Guthrie-Smith brings to life the multitude of alliances, contests, transactions and scams that operate amongst different species. The sheep, for example - already identified as both the subordinate agent of territorial acquisition (in the role of fern-crushing machine) and the possessor of a nonhuman agency that resists settlement (as a nostalgic escapee) - now features as the vehicle for other colonial venturers. 'The grasses and clovers, for instance, bargain with [the sheep] for the right to live; whilst providing him with food and raiment, they utilise his body as a distributing agent' (pp. 236-7). For other plants, interaction with the sheep means competition for survival, a relation of flight or fight, a struggle to the death that could go either way: they have to elude destruction by enormous seed production, or nauseate him by their taste, or escape him on cliffs and rocks, or quietly withstand him and endure his perpetual crop and nibble. One plant alone - the blackberry ( Rubus fruticosus) - is his master, seducing him to destruction with the bait of its black fruit, openly trailing great runners for his entanglement, and finally feeding on his carcase (p. 237). Noting that the blackberry produces a berry beloved by sheep and a root-system adapted to following the lines of sheep-tracks, Guthrie-Smith suggests the plant 'possesses an intelligence and energy worthy of a better cause' (p. 285). Not content merely to debunk the conventional association between sheep and 27</page><page sequence="17">Journal of New Zealand Uterature vegetative mindlessness, Guthrie-Smith challenges the association between mindlessness and vegetation itself. In many ways Tutira resembles a classic Disney animation - a sequence from Fantasia perhaps - in which everything comes alive and acts, everything moves and dances and misbehaves in a wayward but exhilarating choreography. 'These exuberant anthropomorphisms', as Calder calls them, provide the rhetorical means to achieve precision and accuracy in the documentation of otherwise indescribable ecological relationships (p. 139). Describing those plant species that 'to all intents and purposes reach [...] Tutira on their feet', spreading along the road-margins, Guthrie-Smith writes that some make this journey 'with celerity and confidence, by leaps and bounds'; others 'hesitatingly, slowly, step by step, feeling their way'; some, like St John's wort, 'saunter [...] southwards in a very leisurely fashion' (pp. 278, 293). One paragraph discusses the sporadic spread and flourishing of the prickly thistle (Cirsium lanceolatum ): some plants grow without flowering, some flower and disseminate, and some remain 'flat on the ground' until the next year. These plants are described as 'feeling', 'reasoning]', 'admitting', 'reckoning', 'deciding]' and even 'retaining] liberty of choice, option, alternative' in regard to their various options. Yet, however individual plants 'comported themselves' in this case, the passage concludes, '[w]e may be sure they had their reasons, however interpreted by man'. Again, Guthrie-Smith stays with this extended anthropomorphism long enough to ensure the reader understands it as something more than a figure of speech. 'Finality in the matter resided in the plants themselves, not in the ground', he concludes, adding that it is not given to humans to know fully the minds of other species: 'something occult rests in the seed of the plant as in the mind of man' (p. 273). In Tutira, , then, the anthropomorphic disposition, so resolutely outlawed by the natural sciences from the late nineteenth century onwards, continues to offer a way of recognising the complex network of nonhuman agencies, while 28</page><page sequence="18">Meat or Vegetables ? accepting they can never be fully understood - insights problematically neglected by mechanistic Cartesianism and parsimonious scientific positivism. In fact, Guthrie-Smith mobilises anthropomorphism so energetically that he challenges the assumptions that identified it as an epistemological error in the first place. To label any given description of a nonhuman entity 'anthropomorphic' is to assume that the characteristics being ascribed to it are unique to humans in the first place. But Guthrie-Smith's accounts of nonhuman agency are so closely observed and so vividly brought to life that they destabilise precisely this assumption - in particular, as I have argued, the presumption that we know what agency is, and who possesses or enacts it, and how it operates in all circumstances. In opening up such questions, Tutira demonstrates an intellectual audacity that seems remarkable for several reasons: because it occurs in the thick of the most rapid and radical of ecological colonisations, because it so accurately anticipates future needs and currents of thought and, finally, because it depends so heavily on challenging conventional perceptions of that most routinely underestimated of New Zealand's citizens, the sheep.

The Chinese sheep possesses a serene and solid strength of character: see Boria Sax, The Mythical Zoo (Santa Barbara: ABC Clio, 2001), p. 227. Amongst the Hopi of the American Southwest, familiarity with the endemic bighorn produces an association of sheepishness with sharpness of sight and hearing, and with power over nature and the body: see Mark Bahti, Spirit in the Stone (Tucson: Rio Nuevo, 1999), p. 83. 8 Holy Bible: King James Version , Genesis 4:4 and 22:13; Exodus 12; Isaiah 53:7; John 1:19; Psalms 95:7; John 10:4. 9 Bestiary , trans, by Richard Barber (Woodbridge: Boydell Press, 1992), pp. 77-8. 10 Thomas Shadwell, The Virtuoso [1676], ed. by Marjorie Hope Nicolson and David Stuart Rodes (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1966), p. 51. 11 H.

Like Frame, Devanny parallels the violence and exploitation that occurs amongst her human characters with the subjection of 'patient, meek and helpless' sheep to a series of graphically portrayed farming practices: lambing, tail- docking, castration, shearing, slaughter and the loading of a ship's freezer with carcasses 'by the ton' to provide '[m]utton for the overseas maw': see Jean Devanny, The Butcher Shop , ed. by Heather 30</page><page sequence="20">Meat or Vegetables, ?
