<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 7: KENĚ: SHIPIBO-CONIBO DESIGN Luisa Elvira Belaunde Museu Nacional, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil Translated by Sara Welsh Colaianni. Abstract Kené is the Shipibo-Conibo art of wrapping bodies and objects with designs: clothing, pots, bracelets, head bands, oars, and human bodies are all shapes likely to be wrapped with finely fit webs of designs. Drawing on a review of the literature and on personal research, this chapter investigates the tangible and intangible aspects of kené, the ritual knowledge associated with designs, and the techniques used for placing them on a body as well as their links to plants, shamanism, and aesthetic therapies. After analyzing design composition techniques step-by-step and demonstrating how visual effects of depth, movement, and fluorescence are generated, the final section addresses the debate as to whether kené might be a form of writing. Resumen Kené es el arte shipibo-conibo que consiste en envolver los cuerpos y los objetos con diseños: ropa, cerámica, brazaletes, coronas, remos y cuerpos humanos, todos son susceptibles de ser envueltos con redes de diseños finamente calzadas a sus formas. Basándose en una revisión de la literatura y en investigación personal, el artículo examina los aspectos materiales e inmateriales del kené, el conocimiento ritual asociado a los diseños y las técnicas usadas para trazarlos sobre un cuerpo, así como sus lazos con las plantas, el chamanismo y las terapias estéticas. Después de analizar las técnicas de composición paso a paso y de demostrar como los efectos visuales de profundidad, movimiento, y fluorescencia son generados, la última sección aborda el debate sobre si el kené pudiese ser una forma de escritura. Kené is a Shipibo-Conibo word that means "design." It refers to a variety of geometric patterns made by women on the surface of bodies and objects. Characterized by a horror vacuii, the use of contrasting colors, heavy and fine brushstrokes, straight and curved lines, and filigree fillings, kené designs constitute webs of complex compositions. Clothing, pots, bracelets, headbands, oars, and human bodies are all shapes susceptible to being enveloped by networks of designs finely fit to their three-dimensional forms (Gebhart-Sayer, 1985a; Illius, 1994; Heath, 2002; Soria, 2004; Belaunde, 2009). The beauty and plasticity of the designs are most visible in their union with the body in motion. For example, when painting a face, the lines preserve its proportion, following the expression of the face like a gauze finely applied to the nose, cheekbones, and chin. Similarly, painted and embroidered pieces of cloth, called chitonie (or pampanilla), are used by women to wrap their hips and thighs, adjusting to the curvature of the stomach and rear to permit walking and sitting in comfort. Thus, Shipibo-Conibo kené produces a type of hyperskin that embellishes and completes a three-dimensional body. Even seemingly inert objects, such as an oar or a pot, appear to have their own movements when they are covered by designs. Design production techniques are taught by mother to daughter, using various materials. Some are derived from the forest and gardens, such as clay, natural dyes, seeds, and cotton, and others are commercially produced, such as cloth, colored thread, and glass beads. These days, objects covered with kené are in great demand in the growing Amazonian tourist market, and their sale confers on the women an appreciable margin of economic independence from their husbands. The fascination that the colored geometric labyrinths provoke is considered by the Shipibo-Conibo women to be a subtle hunting weapon. They make use of the beauty of their designs to earn needed money to raise their children and actively position themselves in the ever more monetized native economy. The women usually sell their work personally, offering it to the tourists in their communities and to passersby in the city streets. They organize themselves into the flexible feminine networks characteristic of the Shipibo-Conibo matrilocal family model; they travel to the cities on their own initiative and manage their production autonomously (Valenzuela &amp; Valera, 2005; Belaunde, 2011). Seeing and Making Kené The art of kené, however, is not exclusively a material and visible female art. It has an intangible existence intimately related to shamanism and plants. In order to make kené, women must first see kenè in their thoughts in " shinan ," a concept that includes imagination and dreams. From girlhood, women spend hours daily next to their mothers and other female relatives, observing them, imitating them, and training themselves in the art of covering ceramics, clothing, and objects with designs. At night, they dream of designs and think how to bring them, step- by-step, into being. But the ability to see designs is also ritually FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY N.S., NO. 45, NOVEMBER 11, 2016, PP. 81-92 81</page><page sequence="2">acquired. The ritual consists of placing a few drops of piripiri plant ( Cyperus sp.) juice in their eyes and navel. This treatment is meant to inspire them with kené visions and enable them to draw kené with great skill: "A piripiri treatment given in the navel has this effect: as you spread out the cloth, different designs come to mind so you can reproduce them. That happens just like that, it's the piripiri that makes you imagine. . . . There is also a piripiri to put into your eyes. This is found in the flooded lands. Its leaves have designs similar to those we make, with little dots that form figures and lines. To learn to design, the piripiri is boiled and the eyes are treated with its steam" (Agustina Valera, in Valenzuela &amp; Valera, 2005: 65). Women with kené visions do not use physical implements to measure lines, nor do they make models or rough sketches. They simply place themselves in front of a blank piece of cloth, a ceramic, or the surface of skin and begin to shape designs, guiding themselves by the visions in their "thoughts." The finished designs are characterized by lines of various thicknesses forming a web of labyrinthine paths. For the Shipibo-Conibo, the accuracy of the lines, curves, and angles; the color composition; and the proportion of blank spaces and integration of the lines into a symmetrical visual whole, albeit with some asymmetrical elements, are the measure of the artist's mastery. Designs can also manifest themselves in visions during shamanic sessions of ayahuasca taking, an activity that is mainly though not exclusively masculine (Colpron, 2004, 2005, 2006). The term "ayahuasca" refers to both the vine of the plant and the drink made by boiling a mixture either of ayahuasca ( Banisteriopsis caapi) and chacruna ( Psychotria viridis) or of ayahuasca and cahua (Diplopterys cabrer ana) in water. This drink is administered by shamans, called onaya , during group sessions held at night. After years of apprenticeship drinking various types of ayahuasca and other plants "with power," or rao (Tournon, 2006: 42), shamans acquire experience commu- nicating with hidden protective spirits, chaiconibo (celestial beings like the hummingbird and the ancestral inka), and the spirits of great shamans of the past who teach and advise them. They learn to transform themselves spiritually to "travel" through different spheres of the cosmos. When they arrive at the highest level of mastery, shamans are called meraya , that is, someone who transforms himself into a jaguar (Illius, 1994: 197). Shamans see kené in visions and use them to spiritually cure patients. During shamanic sessions and with the shaman as guide, participants also succeed in traveling through the spiritual world and seeing kené (Roe, 1982; Arevalo, 1986; Morin, 1998). As Roldan Pinedo, a Shipibo-Conibo painter, explains, "Everything seen in visions is covered with designs. All have their kené; it is their energy, their medicine. Really pretty, really brilliant. Everything is shining" (Belaunde, 2007: 24). Normally, male shamans do not make kené; they do not paint, embroider, weave designs, or place them materially on the surface of bodies or objects. They only see intangible designs and use them to cure. There exists, therefore, a gender division of labor. Women see kené in their "thoughts," in dreams, and in their imagination and also make kené : they materialize their design visions by painting them, weaving them, and embroidering them on cloth, bodies, and utensils. That is, women bring their visions to light for others to see, reflecting their kené visions around them and in their day-to-day life. In contrast, men see kené in shamanic visions but generally do not produce kené; they do not manifest their visions in order to be seen by others in everyday life. This implies a clear dependence by the men on the women for aesthetic material. All traditional masculine clothing, the tunic and the headdress, and some objects used daily, such as the wooden oars carved by men, are adorned with kené by the women. Without a woman, a man would have no adorned material. In the past, only some men, regarded as homosexuals, used to make kené and carry out activities considered feminine (Roe, 1979). Healing with Kené The Shipibo-Conibo regard rao plants with "power" as intelligent beings par excellence. Plants' "thoughts," or shinan , are contained in the perfumed sap that flows through their veins, and these "thoughts" are communicated to the blood of human beings by maintaining a diet comprised of these plants. Learning, therefore, is conceived of as a transfer of thoughts between fluids, from the sap of the plant to the human blood that transports "thoughts" throughout the body (Belaunde, 2006). Both ayahuasca and piripiri have key connections with cosmology. Ayahuasca, called nishi, or "rope," in Shipibo- Konibo, is a plant that allows one to see the colored energy of plants when it is ingested under the appropriate ritual conditions. Moreover, the twisted rope of the ayahuasca is explicitly identified with the cosmic anaconda ronin , the primordial being, "mother of ayahuasca" and "mother of water," also called yacumama in local Quechua. The anaconda is the aquatic source of all existing designs. The designs on her skin are considered to contain the potential for all the designs of all the plants, animals, things, spirits, and humans. Piripiri, called waste in Shipibo-Conibo, is also a manifestation of the anaconda ronin since according to mythology, this plant sprouted from her ashes. The process of the shamanic healing during ayahuasca sessions is conceived of as painting the bodies of the patients with designs of colored, fragrant light emerging from the shaman's singing. The shaman's voice paints the designs and vice versa, the designs guide his voice. For this reason, Gebhart- Sayer (1985a: 170) calls the designs of the shamanic visions "painted songs," and Illius (1994: 66) observes that the melodies paint beautiful designs over the whole surface of the patient's body to restore him to health. The designs of sick people are distorted and must be restored to return to health. According to Colpron (2005, 2006), shamans can see a patient's physical and spiritual state. A person who has dieted on plants has an aura of designs that is very different from that of a person who has not followed any such diet. During shamanic sessions, the yora canòa , the "framework of pathways" (canòa) that covers the "body" (yora), seen in visions, shows patients' bodies covered with beautiful "therapeutic designs." These designs are the lights associated with their "airs" (wiso), that is, their energy in a luminous, aerial, and fragrant form. A person who is physically, socially, and spiritually healthy has good, perfumed "airs" and appears wrapped in designs of colored lights that are his "aura" (nete). In contrast, a person who is sick, ill willed, and unwilling has no designs because he is surrounded by "bad, dark airs" (jakonma wiso niwebo). These bad, dark airs must be "cleansed" for the person to be able to receive beautiful therapeutic, luminescent, and fragrant designs 82 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">from the shaman: "The ayahuasca session begins when 'the people of the plants' connect from within his mouth to a path {cano) upon which the melody circulates, which permits him to sing in chorus with them. The onanyabo (shamans) do not present themselves as the instigators of those songs: they often compare themselves to a radio - where the machine metaphor comes from - their allies sing through their bodies. Each rao into which the onaya is initiated transmits the shamanic songs thus, by means of the cano " (Colpron, 2004: 295). The designs painted by the shaman's chant come from the rao power plants on which he has dieted and the spiritual beings. Each species of plant has designs attached to its particular attributes: medicinal, defensive, seductive, and so on. These kenë belong to the "owners" or "mothers" of the rao plants {rao koshibo ), considered to be very much more beautiful {kikin metsa) than the designs painted by the Shipibo-Conibo. Shamans can contact the "mothers" of the plants they have dieted on, feel their airs, see their designs, and sing their songs. Shamans also cure their patients by singing the designs of other spiritual beings and the pathways of the cosmos. For example, designs of powerful "clothing," such as the skins of jaguars, fish {ipo), dolphins, and butterfly's wings, appear in visions as different kenë patterns. Renowned shaman Neten Vitá explains that in order to cure, one must contact the protector spirits who are "heavenly strips of designs {las tiras de dibujos de mi cielo or noco naina kenë )" (Illius, 1994: 197). Transcribed below, a song by Neten Vitá illustrates how the healing process occurs by means of the intangible sketching of designs: The powerful one has a drawing, The powerful hummingbird has a drawing In the tip of his beak. He has a beautiful drawing, That he draws in my notebook. (Illius, 1994: 196) The therapeutic effects of shamanic chants depend on several variables, including the aesthetic perception of acoustic phenomena, emotional perception and peak experiences, suggestive interpretations of the lyrics, extramusical parame- ters, and contextual projections (Brabec de Mori, 2009: 133). According to Neten Vita's explanation, the hummingbird's purpose is to draw intangible designs on the bodies of patients. Its power to act on the world is concentrated on the tip of its beak, which serves as its paintbrush. The notion, as we shall see later, is of great importance in understanding the transforma- tions effected through designs. Shama (or xama) is the "accumulated potency" that stems from the interior of beings and flows to the tip of their extremities. The tender shoots of plants and the beaks of birds concentrate the greatest transformative power (Colpron, 2004). The Origins of Kené in the Mythology According to Shipibo-Conibo mythology, people learned to make kenë by copying the clothing of an inka woman. In the mythic past, ancestors of the Shipibo-Conibo smeared their bodies with black genipapo dye {Genipa americana ), but they did not know about designs with geometric motifs. One day, a boy saw an astonishingly beautiful young woman walking on the other side of the river. Fascinated, he crossed the river and chased after her, building a bridge of tree trunks to avoid burning his feet since on that riverbank there were burning sands. When he caught up with her, she lay dead. He lifted her body and carried her to his village. All the people of the village and neighboring villages came to marvel at her beauty and the designs that adorned her. A passage from this myth, transcribed by Bertrand-Rousseau (1983: 83-85), follows: The Shipibo-Conibo arrived first, followed by the Shetebo, afterwards the Konibo, the Huaria Pano, [and] the Piro; upon arriving, they all looked; all were fascinated. The woman was dressed in various skirts. Then, since the Shipibo-Conibo had arrived first, they took off the first skirt with much respect, the one with the drawing of a cross. Afterwards, the Conibo took off the next skirt, the one with curved drawings, the Huari Pano were left with the skirt with the drawing of leaves, the Piro with the one with drawings of broken lines. In times past, the women just painted themselves with black genipapo , with red bixa; but they didn't know how to paint themselves with our drawings. It is for this reason that now we know how to paint [this way]; it is because of what happened long ago. All the things that I have said, we learned from the woman who died long ago. They also say that she was sent by the good Inca; so they say. Here end the ancient words. The story says that each ethnic group that came to admire the inka woman's beauty learned a design of its own. Among those mentioned there are three Panoan-speaking people - the Shipi- bo-Conibo, Conibo, and Huari Pano - and one from the Arawak linguistic family - the Piro (Yine). Until today, in fact, the Shipibo-Conibo consider the Yine designs beautiful like their own in spite of not belonging to the Panoan cultural group. Notably, the design granted to the Shipibo-Conibo was the cross. According to explanations by various women, the cross design is associated with the wooden cross of the Anisheati female puberty ritual, to which hunting animals were tied to be sacrificed by boy participants in the festival (Morin, 1998; Valenzuela &amp; Valera, 2005: 63) (see Ödland, this volume). The myth, therefore, confirms the importance of the Anisheati festival in Shipibo-Conibo identity. But, as we shall see later, the cross is also a mediator between the living and the dead. It is also notable that the myth narrates the journey of a young human to the celestial ground of the inka . She finds herself on the other bank of the river, where the burning fire of the sun reigns, in a place intolerable to common mortals. The boy manages to find a way to avoid being burned and succeeds in carrying the inka girl back to his side of the river, in other words, to earth. But being an inka , she dies so that her body can cross to the other bank of the river and enter the world of mortals, a process the opposite of the transformations that take place when a mortal dies: crossing the river that separates mortal life from the eternal life of inka spirits (Roe, 1982; Morin, 1998). According to the Shipibo-Conibo, inka are magnificent beings, something akin to the perfect exponents of the universe. They are eternal, astonishingly beautiful, and fierce like the sun BELAUNDE: KENĚ 83</page><page sequence="4">and jaguar, and they radiate rainbow-colored lights. But they are also ambiguous figures, and thus two types of inka exist in the mythology: greedy inka , who denied sharing knowledge and power with the Shipibo-Conibo, and generous inka, who taught people all the technologies for living: making ceramics, painting designs, and using ayahuasca and other rao plants to cure diseases (Urteaga, 1991; FUCSHICO, 1998). This ambiguity is not exceptional or unique to the inka given that it extends to all spiritual beings in the Shipibo-Conibo cosmology, including their own curandero shamans, who are often suspected of practicing witchcraft and "doing harm." The ambivalence and ambiguity of spiritual powers is inherent in Shipibo-Conibo thinking: all power can be used toward positive or negative ends. Even the powers of the primordial anaconda can be used in a positive or a negative way. The inka wear splendorous kenë designs of unequaled perfection and are the manifestation par excellence of beauty in their celestial sphere. Yet the original source of the designs is not celestial but rather aquatic; they are derived from the "mother of water." As mentioned, all of the designs emerged from the marks on the skin of ronin , the primordial anaconda (Illius, 1994: 199; Colpron, 2004). Gebhart-Sayer (1985a: 150) suggests, then, that generically all the kenè designs can be considered as ronin kené, designs of the anaconda, although they carry different names. The same idea is found among the Cashinahua, people of the Panoan linguistic family from the Purús and Jordão rivers. As Lagrou (2007) observes, the designs of the anaconda contain the world. Each mark on her skin can open itself and reveal other designs. In a beautiful shamanic chant, Herlinda Agustín, a renowned designer and female shaman, relates how light and all the kené of the universe were formed with the songs of the designs of the primordial anaconda's skin: In the beginning a gigantic anaconda lived in darkness, Singing the designs of her back, And the designs fell from her mouth to her songs. The designs gathered together And took form, Creating the universe and the people. Nevertheless, other chants of the anaconda can be used to take revenge on one's enemies and "do harm" to others. As the shaman Neten Vitá points out, these songs are very dangerous since instead of painting beautiful designs over the patient's body to heal them, they are used as mortal weapons that imprison and drown the person's body with their poisoned darts, black fumes, and bad smells: The lattice locks (him) in. The lattice of the great boa closes. Upon closing, it kills (him). (Illius, 1994: 199) Due to the inherent ambivalence of spiritual powers and the possibility of an attack by witchcraft during shamanic sessions, the participants wish to procure luminous, fragrant, and serene visions. The experience of dark, repulsive, and anguishing visions rapidly brings forth the intervention of the shaman, who tries to dissipate the negative vision and reestablish the colors and fragrances by means of songs of healing kené designs. Shamans explain that plant diets are necessary in order for the generative power of the anaconda to activate shamanic sessions in a healing way: One sees those designs when dieting on plants and their spirit teaches you, then, and one watches those designs when taking ayahuasca, one sees everything. Those designs are the air of the chacruna, of the ayahuasca; they are its air. You see designs that are the designs of the vine of the ayahuasca, and that vine is like an anaconda. The anaconda is the spirit of the ayahuasca that wishes to give us more wisdom through its air and makes us see its designs. From the anaconda, from the spirit of the vine of the ayahuasca, come all the designs since the beginning. It is from there that we and all things have come. The anaconda that is seen when you take ayahuasca is nishi; it is the vine of the ayahuasca. (Herlinda Agustín, pers. comm.) Gebhart-Sayer (1987) corroborates the idea that the primordial anaconda "mother of ayahuasca" (nishi ibo) projects luminescent designs and fragrant air on the shaman's eyes, and the shaman emits melodies that correspond to his luminous vision. Shipibo- Conibo women also explain that the curing rituals of the eyes and navel with piripiri have some similar effects as ayahuasca inasmuch as "it makes you see all kinds of visions. It gives you intelligence. Knowledge comes to your mind." This is because piripiri is a plant born from the ashes of the primordial anaconda: They say that in the old days they burned boas, the offspring of the yacumama ("mother of water"). Their ashes remained. From their ashes emerged, from what they burned of the yacumama , piripiri originat- ed. That is what our grandmothers called the piripiri for designs. From there, piripiri emerged for design When we cure our eyes with piripiri we have dreams. We dream that we are in the middle of elegant and resplendent designs. At times, we work with the piripiri spirit at night. We design in our sleep. At other times, we see the yacumamas. This doesn't just happen; it's due to the piripiri with which we've cured ourselves. What makes us learn with piripiri isn't something recent; we've had piri piri since ancient times. (Valenzuela &amp; Valera, 2005: 64-66) With their aquatic origins, the women's art of making tangible designs and the shamanic practice of healing with intangible designs are intertwined. The designer women embellish the world by visualizing and making kené thanks to the legacy of the anaconda who rebounded from her ashes in piripiri. The shaman men heal thanks to the power of the anaconda present in the ayahuasca that allows them to see, sing, and cleanse patients using intangible designs. Both practices beautify and transform people's bodies with the ritual use of plants. Meanings of Kené The main misunderstanding when undertaking the study of kené is trying to interpret the geometric patterns as if they were strict figurative representations of something. There is a 84 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">figurative aspect in kené to the extent that the motifs are called by the names of animals and things that permit recall of their stylized outlines. These names designate designs, but they can vary from place to place and do not encompass all of their meanings. Lagrou (2007, 2011, 2012, 2013), scholar of Cashinahua kené , which is very similar to the Shipibo-Conibo kené, points out the fact that some designs may be called by the name of a bird, a body part, or a star. However, this does not mean that the figure is simply an image that reproduces the shape of such a bird or that its function is to represent it as if it were a visual code. In order to understand the multiple meanings of the designs, it is best to be guided by the explanations given by the Shipibo- Conibo women themselves. Reshin Wesna, for example, explains to her daughter the names of the designs that adorn the chitontes, or pampanilla skirts, in the following manner: Daughter, designs exist with different names. The names vary because we don't speak the same in the Upper, Middle and Lower Ucayali. There are "Curved Designs" that represent the leaves of trees and arched lines. The "Straight Design" represents straight trees; this is an ancient design. The "Bone Design" represents the fish bones that are piled up when we eat. The "Scorpion's Tail" is also known as an arched design and represents a scorpion with its tail raised; the "Piranha Teeth Design" are zigzag lines that adorn the border of the pampanillas and represent the teeth of a piranha. The "Spider Design" represents the tangle of a spider web; the "Flowers Design" is small embroideries in different colors that represent the flowers that decorate the pampanillas. The "Fish Tail Design" has the form of a forked stick that represents the tail of a fish. The "Cross Design" is made to remember the death of our loved ones. There is also a basket design. (Asociación Noi Rao, 2006: 93-94) Some names designate the qualities of the lines, such as fine, curvilinear lines, called birish mayá kené; rectilinear (ponté huixá); perpendicular (nia); and wide, rectilinear designs, called canòa kené (Illius, 1994: 201). The word canòa refers to the frame of a house or some other type of lattice or scaffold. Other names designate body parts, such as eyes (vero), head (mápo), wings (pechi ), and hands (mequén); human beings (jóni); or geometrical patterns, such as asps (axtá), crosses (coros), and "face to face" (vuimana) (Gebhart-Sayer, 1985a: 148; Morin, 1998). " Bero [vero], which means 'eye' or 'seed,' designates the small designs, which can be round, square, or triangular, and which can be found at the end of a main line. Usually, they are painted in red, yellow or blue" (Illius, 1994: 195). The lines that border the chitonie skirts also have names: "Star Line, Dog's Vagina Line, Cat's Claw Line, Chain Line" (Association Noi Rao, 2006: 94). Women say that there are fashions, and at times, some designs are more popular than others are. In addition, they are always very curious to know about other people's designs and ready to learn them. Kené is a living, changing art (Illius, 1994). For example, they say that about 50 years ago, the wide, rectilinear canòa designs were more in style, but these days, they prefer to make fine and curvilinear mayá designs. One of the designs most used on the chitonte skirts is the vero-yoshin, "the spirit of the eye" design. It consists of a series of curved lines arranged around a central cross. Currently, with the opportu- nities and demands of the tourist market, one of the most popular designs is the "ayahuasca heart," showing circular patterns associated with the patterns seen in a transversal cut of an ayahuasca vine. Changes are also expressed in the innovative use of color combinations and the production of new embroidered and painted items for sale, such as bags, shirts, dresses, and tablecloths made by women to attract new clients (Belaunde, 2012). Agustina Valera, a renowned designer, tells us more about this complex polysemy. Referring to the "curved design" mayá kené, which in this case translates (in Spanish) to "design with curve," she reveals a wider horizon of meaning: There are designs with curves, the fish spine design, the metiinko design. The design with curves is always accompanied by the cross. This is the cross that our grandfathers buried straight up in the ground when they celebrated the Ani Sheati; they tied a maquisapa or another animal to it and shot it with arrows. . . . The design with curves is because single boys and girls go around looking for everything. This is the significance of the design with curves. In the same way, our river doesn't go straight but serpentine instead; some curves are big and others smaller. That is why those that do the mashá sing: "the river goes making turns." We design these turns. The very small designs represent the great quantity of people who came invited to Ani Sheati. The adornments in the form of the eye represent our communities. (Valen- zuela &amp; Valera, 2005: 63) For Agustina, it is not simply about associating a design with a bird or animal; it is also about establishing a relationship between a design and some significant aspect of her own memories and that of her kin and ancestors. It is especially about the women's puberty festival, the Anisheati and the cross (see also Ödland, this volume; Morales et al., this volume). The mashá was danced to celebrate the flow of women's blood as well as the flow of manioc beer served to the guest in great quantities. The newly fertile woman was thus associated with the flow of the river and the "mother of water," the primordial anaconda (Leclerc, 2003; Soria, 2004). The fact that the Shipibo-Conibo word " korós " derives from "cruz," "cross" in Spanish, suggests that this design could have been learned from the Christian missionaries. But it may be only the name, not the design, that was learned from them. Studies show that the cross was a central figure not only in the Anisheati festival but also in funerary ceremonies and cosmol- ogy (Gebhart-Sayer, 1985a; Morin, 1998: 301). Girard and Eakin, who collected information in the middle of the 20th century, say that women "reproduce obsessively" in their handiwork a cross that, according to their informants, stands at the top of the stairway that leads to the sky or in the doorway or center of the sky (Girard, 1958: 239; Eakin et al., 1980: 63). This heavenly cross may have been associated with the constellation of the Southern Cross, used as reference for river navigation at night. But it seems that its importance was rather derived from its geometrical properties and cosmological significance as a mediator between the living and the dead. The cross was associated with the vero yoshin, "spirit of the BELAUNDE: KENÉ 85</page><page sequence="6">eye," which came out of the eyes of a diseased person and rose to the heavenly dwelling place of the inka divinities. As mentioned, the vero yoshin design, made of a central cross surrounded by curved lines, is still one of the favorites embroidered on skirts. In the past, crosses were also painted on both cheeks of the dead for funerary rituals (Eakin et al., 1980: 70.) Designs as Pathways A key aspect of the polysemy of kenè resides in the association of the graphics with the concept of "cano" or "pathway." The prefix " ca " is used to designate beings with designs such as the jaguar (inu), the aquatic turtle (cabori), the alligator (cape), and the pineapple (cancan) (Colpron, 2004). According to Shipibo- Conibo understandings, the designs reveal a geometric frame- work (canòa) of pathways through which beings move, traveling, communicating with each other, and transporting knowledge, objects, and powers. There are pathways in all areas of existence, from the macroscale to the microscale. According to Heath (1980), in the sky, the kenè motifs are found in the pathways of the Milky Way. Illius (1994) also states that the designs on ceramics refer to the celestial vault, providing a microcosmic model of the universe. In the landscape, designs are associated with the serpentine pathways of the rivers in the jungle. Agustina Valera expresses this idea, as we saw above. She also says, "We, ourselves, are the designs, our own river, all of our adornments" (Valenzuela &amp; Valera, 2005: 64). Thus, there is a close identification between the female body, the rivers, and their designs. Women's bodies are also similar to painted pots, especially the large pot called chorno, in which manioc beer was fermented and then served during festivals, inebriating and enlivening the guests. Like a pot for brewing beer, a woman contains the fetus and makes it grow in her womb. "The large pot represents ourselves, it wears the Shipibo- Conibo woman's pampanilla (skirt). Just like we embroider our pampanilla, we adorn the pot" (Valenzuela &amp; Valera, 2005: 62). In the flora, designs are seen in the pathways of the stems, ribs, and veins of the leaves that transport the sap. These veins of the leaves are, in effect, called ca, the root of the word cano, or pathway. As mentioned above, the pathways that better transmit rao plant's energy are the veins of the tender shoots. The miniscule designs of these leaves contain great therapeutic strength given that the shama, the "accumulated potency" of a being, is concentrated in the tip of the stem: "Power comes from the inside of the tree and is concentrated in its extremities. . . . Knowledge emerges from the depths of the trees and sprouts out from the shoots. These small branches are associated with the pathways (canobo) through which the rao transmit their knowledge, but also permit travel to far off regions" (Colpron, 2004: 282-289). Finally, some designs, such as the cross, are mediators in the pathway uniting the land of the living and the realm of the dead. The cross of the vero-yushin design was meant to help the "spirit of the eye" of a deceased person travel up to the heavenly place of the eternal inka , where it was reunited with the spirits of ancient kin. Without the mediation of the design, the "spirit of the eye" could lose its way, and instead of joining the celestial beings, its postmortem destiny would be to remain on earth as a shadow, eating garbage and scaring the living with his whistles. The journey we have made along the pathways of the meanings of kenè enables us to see that the Shipibo-Conibo designs are much more than aesthetic objects. As recent ethnographies demonstrate for other Amazonian peoples, indigenous graphics are part of rituals aiming to cause bodily transformations and produce capable and skillful persons (for the Yine [Piro], see Gow, 2001; for the Wayampi, see Gallois, 2002; for the Wayana, see Van Velthem, 2003; for the Cashinahua, see Lagrou, 2007, 2012; and for the Ashaninka, see Beysen, 2008). Among the Shipibo-Conibo, kenè unites aesthetics and medicine and brings together the senses in synesthesia. In kenè, one finds sight, hearing, touch, and smell and that which is beautiful, therapeutic and correct, and tangible and intangible. This combination of senses is charac- teristic of the Shipibo-Conibo notion of kikin, which means both "correct" and "beautiful." Kikin implies a visual, acoustic, and olfactory experience and includes moral values such as subtlety, appropriateness, vibrancy, and cultural suitability (Gebhart-Sayer, 1985a: 161). The skills of seeing and making kenè rest on the human being's incorporation of the energy of rao plants, which, in turn, manifest the generative and predatory powers of the primordial anaconda. All visual, olfactory, sound, and tactile forms of the Shipibo- Conibo designs are manifestations and celebrations of the beauty of the anaconda and the eternal inka that shine with great splendor in the sky. "The design is what hypnotizes us with her beauty, and then converts herself into yacumama ('mother of water'). The yacumama herself is our design," says Agustina Valera (Valenzuela &amp; Valera, 2005: 62). Considering that the great predator of the Amazonian jungle hunts its prey by hypnotizing, trapping, and enveloping it, we can better under- stand why the structure of kenè expresses a feminine aesthetic of labyrinthine hypnotism and enclosure. The association between healing, hypnotism, seduction, fierceness, and designs has also been identified among other Amazonian people (Gow, 1999; Gallois, 2002; Van Velthem, 2003; Lagrou, 2007; Beysen, 2008). Corporeal designs generate a dynamic relationship between healing and being healed, perceiving and being perceived, desiring and being desired, and devouring and being devoured by others. Windows on Skin: Composing Designs This section focuses on the formal structure of kenè. In order to understand kenè, one must learn the way designs are produced. The process generally begins by delineating a frame, (rectangular, square, circular, or another shape) on the cloth or the surface of the ceramic or the skin on which designs will be woven, embroidered, or painted. Borrowing from an image in Western architecture, this frame is like a window that directs the vision toward a landscape of designs. However, it is a window toward the interior of the surface. That is, on drawing the frame, a horizon of visibility is opened, showing what is inside the surface of the object. The frame is like a vantage point, a point of view toward the interior of the skin (Belaunde, 2013). Furthermore, since the frame covers only a limited area of the surface of the body or object, only part of the design composition is revealed. That is to say, the designs are not discrete units; they are networks that extend in a potentially infinite manner. Since the frame is limited, it is possible to see 86 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 7.1. Contemporary chorno from the community of Caco Macaya, Bajo Ucayali. 95 cm high X 64 cm wide. Used with permission of Martin Ccorisapra. only what appears through the open window. If the window were larger or had a different shape, it would permit a wider or different view. According to Heath (2002a), it is about a kind of Amazonian "window to infinity," as much for its cosmological associations as for its composition. The networks of the kené potentially extend to wrap the whole body. Therefore, all designs made within a frame imply their virtual totality, even though only a small piece may be visible. In other words, every piece of design made on a part of a body is a manifestation of a larger invisible web of designs. Let us examine step-by-step the sequence of producing designs on a fresh piece of pottery. Normally, the designer woman begins covering some areas of the surface with white- or brown-colored clay. Next, using a splinter of wood, she paints different frames in black into which she is going to paint the designs that she has in her "thoughts." Then she paints the design compositions within each frame, beginning with the thickest lines until the surface within the frame is covered. Then, making finer lines, she paints two lines that run parallel to the left and to the right of the thicker line, as if they were banks of a river that replicate the water's course on both riverbanks. Next, making even finer lines, she fills the areas delimited by the borders with tiny designs. To finish, she finishes the composition by painting the figures created by the intersection of fines. This step is optional, but the sequence - making the frame, drawing thicker fines, making finer fines, and filling the spaces with even finer and smaller designs - is structural. These steps can be duplicated, creating labyrinths of even more complex figures. For example, in some cases, the thickest fine can be composed internally of two fines that run parallel, delimiting an interior colored space. When painting, women generally follow these steps, but each one does things in her way, according to personal idiosyncrasies and family tradition (Belaunde, 2011). Figures 7.1 to 7.3 show the sequence of composing kené on a chomo pot from the community of Caco Macaya that has two frames with designs painted with black on a white background. Each frame covers a complete horizontal strip around the body of the pot. The bottom of the pot is painted with reddish-brown clay. In Caco Macaya, chomo pots are still used to ferment the cooked manioc dough and serve manioc beer during great festivities, such as the Anisheati. The pots can be used only once, when they are new. After the feast, they are abandoned or sold to tourists. In the past, it is likely that similar pots were used to bury the dead. Color and Effects of Depth and Movement The same sequence of composition is used to embroider designs on dark cloth, with a great variety of embroidery stitches as well as techniques of reverse applique. The materials are bought mostly in shops in the city. Only a few dyes, such as tree barks and colored soils, come from the forest. These are used to color cloth and create the backgrounds, ranging from deep black to reddish brown or creamy white, against which the bright colors of commercial threads will shine and generate effects of BELAUNDE: KENÉ 87</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 7.2. Digital image of chorno in Figure 7.1 showing the two frames of different painted design compositions on the center and the neck of the pot. Illustration: L. Belaunde fluorescence. Although the extensive use of such a variety of colors is a recent phenomenon, probably dating from the 1950s or even later, it is one of the most striking features of current keně compositions. Women have a surprising eye for color combination, and each new design composition has its own color scheme. Never do two apparently similar design compo- sitions have the same colors. The effect of fluorescence generated by the contrast between the colored threads and the background cloth highlights the spatial structure of the lines, enabling the viewer to see the landscapes of designs contained in the frames embroidered on the textile surface even better (see Fig. 7.4). The finished design composition generates a complex visual impression, resulting from the superimposition of lines of different thicknesses. For example, in the embroidered chitonie of Figure 7.4, there are two embedded frames. In each frame, there is a different design composition, and the composition of the interior frame has an oblique axis. Figures 7.5 and 7.6 reconstruct the composition process of the lines with different thickness within these frames, re-creating the various layers of designs superimposed on the black and brown designs dyed in the cloth. The finest designs on this piece are little white crosses. They give the impression of being on a background plane with the thicker embroidered lines closer to the viewer or that they are moving toward the viewer, while the other lines are farther away. The thicker lines seem to be superimposed on the finer lines, which appear to continue in the background behind them. That is, the finished composition of superimposed designs within the frame is like a landscape of designs with depth. Furthermore, the lines in the background are not completely symmetrical, and their asymmetry accentuates the sensation of movement and depth. In Figure 7.6, the backgrounds of white crosses are oriented in the same direction, but in the embroidered chitonie (Fig. 7.7), these filler designs are not uniform. Many crosses are incomplete and oriented in different directions. Their asymmetry accentu- ates the visual effect of movement and depth generated. The same happens in the bag FM341533 (Fig. 7.8). Different colors of thread have been used for all the lines: the thickest central line, the two parallel thinner lines, and the smaller filler designs. Solid colors have been used to fill in the areas of intersection between lines. Women explain that they use these patches of colors to lighten up and "alegrar" "rejoice," and "bring happiness" to their clothes. The smaller filler designs in blue thread reproduce a fixed pattern, but they are oriented in Fig. 7.3. The sequence of steps in painting design compositions on the chorno in Figure 7.2. The upper and lower frames have different design compositions. (A) The frames are outlined. (B) In each frame, the thickest design lines are painted in black. In the upper frame, the areas created by the meeting of the lines are colored in red. (C) In each frame, two finer lines are added to parallel the sides of the thick line. (D) Completing the two design compositions, the interior spaces between the thick lines and the thinner, parallel lines are filled with even finer designs. On most chornos like this, one frame covers the widest part of the middle of the pot, and another covers the high part of the neck. Anthropomorphic or effigy pots may have more frames, each with its own design composition. The face of these pots, delimited by the angles of the chin, hair, and chest, has frames with designs different from the rest of the body. Illustration: L.

Their asymmetry of the also heightens the sense of movement, depth, and multiple planes. According to Lagrou (2012, 2013), the asymmetrical elements are key to Amazonian designs. In her analysis of Cashinawa designs, she argues that their kenë is produced by culturally specific techniques of seeing. Webs of designs act as mind traps that capture the eye of the viewer. The asymmetrical features play a key role in as much as they create a breaking point, a punctum , where the symmetrical balance between the lines is unsettled and a sense of asymmetry is generated, capturing the viewer. Perception becomes dynamic as background and foreground alternate, and some figures are distinguished in between the lines and then vanish from perception, suggesting a constant transformation of the perceptual experience. The same argument applies to the Shipibo-Conibo kenë. The asymmetrical elements may not be visible to most nonindigenous viewers, not trained to see the way Shipibo-Conibo women see kenë. To an outside observer, the symmetry of design compositions is usually dominant. However, looking carefully, the asymmetrical features can be perceived, as we have shown above. Our analysis of the formal composition of kenë also suggests that the skin is not truly a surface but rather a space. Inside the skin are found landscapes of kenë where the gaze can penetrate with profundity. Infinity is skin deep. Controversies on Kené as Writing On returning from his trips to America in the mid- 19th century, the explorer Alexander von Humboldt published a paper on annotated notebooks found by the Franciscan monk Narcissus Silbar among the Panoan-speaking people at the mouth of the Sarayacu River. The books, made of cotton pages bound with thread and woven palm covers, contained human and animal figures and lines of symbols. According to the people, the books came from their ancestors and were about "hidden things that no foreigner should know about." These books aroused great curiosity among the monks and other Europeans there but disappeared before anyone could understand their meanings (Gebhart-Sayer, 1985a: 153; Tournon, 2001: 85). According to Tournon (2001: 86), it is likely that the notebooks to which von Humboldt referred contained some type of graphic made by the Panoan-speaking people, consti- tuting not writing of their own but rather drawings imitating the forms of western letters. According to this and other authors, including DeBoer and Raymond (1987), since there is no mention of kenë prior to the 19th century, the Shipibo-Conibo art of designs probably originated in the missionary centers of the 19th century, such as Sarayacu, where Panoan speakers were intermingled with Tupi-language speakers. According to Gebhart-Sayer (1985a: 155) and other writers, kenë designs existed before the arrival of the missionaries, but it is likely that Western writing and books did have an impact on them. For example, in the middle of the 20th century, it was common to use books with designs in the Anisheati feast. During the dancing, the shaman carried a wooden box with a book on his head and handed it to women who were beautifully dressed with all kinds of kenë adornment (Waisbard &amp; Waisbard, 1959: 68). It would not be surprising if the notebooks mentioned by von Humboldt were covered in kenë and that the style of the designs could be influenced by missionary calligraphy as well as by the designs of neighboring people, such as the Cocama and the Quechua. It is likely that, in the past, the Shipibo-Conibo had an open and innovative attitude, as is still the case today. 90 FIELDIANA. ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 7.8.

For example, Herlinda Agustín explained the following: "The designs of the books are like our Shipibo- Conibo designs, what we call kené. But our kené designs come from the ayahuasca" (pers. comm.). Western writing is called nawa kené , that is, the "design of foreigners," an idea that is also found among other Panoan-speaking people, such as the Cashinahua (Lagrou, 2007). Like plants, books are made of leaves covered with designs. Colpron (2004) mentions that the leaves of books are, according to the Shipibo-Conibo, similar to the leaves of the rao , power plants, and the written graphics similar to the ribs on leaves where the power and knowledge of plants is concentrated. This is why one can diet on books just as one can diet on plants and thus acquire the "airs" of the spirits of the books. "For example, upon tapping the pot with newspaper when ayahuasca was cooking in it, a shaman acquired the exotic knowledge of the newspapers. Since then, he possesses two auxiliary foreign spirits (nawa jónibo) and can travel to faraway places" (Colpron, 2004: 270). BELAUNDE: KENÉ 91</page><page sequence="12">One of the main differences between Western writing and kené would be, then, that while Western writing registers the words of human beings, kené permits registering, remembering and reliving the melodies, smells, colored lights, and energies of the spirits. As we have suggested, the significance of designs is, above all, visual and transformative; kené is a way of seeing and being seen, thus affecting persons and bodies graphically. Some researchers, however, take a semantic approach, analyzing the shapes and names of specific motifs and relating them to individual ideograms searching for specific encoded significance (Soria, 2004). Other researchers approach the writing and reading of designs from their musical connections. The musical dimension of kené is one of its more intriguing aspects. As mentioned, designs seen in shamanic visions are intrinsically linked to shamanic chants. Chants and designs are expressions of the synesthesia of visual, auditory, and olfactory senses caused by the ingestion of ayahuasca and other plants "with power." Under the effect of these plants, the designs are seen, sung, and smelled by the shaman and participants in the healing session. On this point, all Shipibo-Conibo shamans, designer women, and researchers seem to agree. However, some women say that the designs painted, embroidered, and woven on physical bodies may also have such musical and healing connections. For example, Gebhart-Sayer (1987) reports that song is used by women as a technique to coordinate the execution of designs, especially to paint the large chorno, pots used to ferment masato that used to measure more than 1 m in diameter by 80 cm in height (Heath, 1980:10). Illius (1994: 186) also suggests that the synesthetic perceptions produced by the plants were used as a template for the conservation of melodies of shamanic chants and, inversely, that melodies served as codification of the designs. For example, the design vero (eye) that usually closes a line of strokes with a little triangle (a circle or little square) is associated with the last moments of the shamanic melodies that usually terminate with a prolonged, deep, and sonorous expiration: "[M]y informants compared the coiled tip of a design motif (often adorned with a vero) with dramatic finales of individual verses of the shaman's songs, when the shaman squeezed the last breath of air from his lungs, which it is said represents the shama (accumulated potency) of the song" (Illius, 1994: 170). At the source of these ideas stands a family of well- known Shipibo-Conibo designer women and shamans who have worked as informants with several anthropologists. A key member of this family was Herlinda Agustín, who died in 2010 in her mid-fifties and had great renown both as a designer and as a shaman and used to conduct ayahuasca sessions herself together with her husband, Enrique Sinuiri. She spoke good Spanish and had an impressive presence and a beautiful high- pitched singing voice that combined with her husband's to perform healing rituals. She traveled in Peru and abroad, especially the United States, providing ayahuasca sessions, and featured in documentaries, such as Woven Songs of the Amazon , directed by Anna Stevens (2005, Green Spider Productions), and Esas voces que curan , directed by Delia Ackerman (2011, Black Tartan Productions). According to Herlinda, the designs placed on the surface of bodies and objects shared the musical qualities of the intangible designs seen in ayahuasca visions and could be sung, generating a healing effect. Each composition of kené had an associated chant (bewa). There were designs to rejoice, to fall in love, to gain insight, and many more, depending on the kind of healing requested. Given Herlinda's statements, one could compare the designs to a musical score. Nevertheless, this would be very general comparison because kené could be more a loose calligraphy or a mnemonic technique that enables inspiration to interpret a song rather than a form of explicitly codified written music. On various occasions, I saw Herlinda sing while running her finger along the musical pathways of the designs that she had embroidered or painted on pieces of cloth. As I could observe, instead of actually reading information coded in the designs, she was inspiring herself by their sight, remember- ing songs and entering into a state attuned to healing. According to Herlinda, only a few women knew how to chant the designs. The knowledge of the design songs was disappear- ing because most production of cloth, ceramics, and painted objects was meant for the tourist market. Her statements have been placed in doubt, and the ethno- graphic evidence seems to demonstrate that, indeed, most women deny that the designs they paint, embroider, and weave could be sung. Nevertheless, some women who happen to practice shamanism - as Herlinda did - agree with her and also stress the links between chants and designs. The issue may therefore rest on whether women have or do not have personal experience as shamans. The controversy, however, led to a dispute about the authenticity of data collected by various researchers who worked with Herlinda and her family. Neither the excellent quality of her embroidered pieces of cloth nor the beauty of her shamanic songs has been called into question. She was criticized for disagreeing with the collective knowledge of the majority of the women, for having successfully attracted the attention of the international public, and for supposedly having induced the anthropologists to error. Certainly, this remains a topic of discussion since there are other ethnographic cases where designs placed on object are associated with shamanic chants. The study of Yekuana basketry by Guss (1990), for example, shows that basketry designs have songs and shamanistic powers. In my opinion, the dispute came from translation difficulties between indigenous and Western thought (Albert, 2002). The misunderstanding stems from our tendency to interpret Herlinda's statements as if she had the same concerns with codes and ideograms as Western scholars. The song "reading" that she gave the designs came from her experiences as a master designer and female shaman as well as from her "thoughts," that is, her visionary ability, her relationship with the plants she had dyed, and the links she had established with patients, tourists, researchers, and filmmakers. If she used her experi- ences to promote herself, it would not be unusual since commercialization is part of the contemporary transformation of Shipibo-Conibo art and shamanism. The origin of the misunderstanding is ours: on the one hand, we seek confirma- tion of our hypothesis about the existence/nonexistence of secret writing; on the other hand, we demand authentic collective and ancestral knowledge without leaving room for women's personal transformation and creativity. In spite of the difference between seeing and making kené that is typical of the division of artistic and shamanic labor between men and women, in both cases designs have an eminently aesthetic and therapeutic purpose because, in their views, beauty is also health. Both the tangible kené embroidered and painted and the intangible visions of designs embellish people and things, wrapping them with colorful webs of energy drawn from powerful plants and the primordial anaconda, "mother of water." 92 FIELDIANA: ANTHROPOLOGY</page></plain_text>
