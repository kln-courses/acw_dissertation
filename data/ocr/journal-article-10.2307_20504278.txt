Wyatt London Abstract This paper argues that the complex sequence in KTU 1.15 ii 13-16, in the Keret story from Ugarit, contains a royal birth oracle which is modelled on real-life practice; furthermore, the circumstances and mechanism of its utterance are suggested by KTU 1.3 iii 19-31 and parallels in the Baal cycle, formulaic passages describing how communication between heaven and earth was believed to be effected. These passages in turn are elucidated by reference to biblical tradi tions concerning sacred trees and stones as media for prophetic utterance, particularly when an oracle was actively sought in royal and quasi-royal situations. The Ugaritic material is thus shown to provide the first evidence of a form of prophecy from Ugarit, bound to the cult, and compa rable to evidence found from Mari, Assyria and the West Semitic world.

Introduction Oracles and analogous phenomena constitute an important part of religion, in its function as an organizational system designed to assist human communi ties in the management of space and time, with particular reference to the future. The future, as an unknown quantity, naturally arouses anxieties and a desire to predict events and to avoid possible disasters.1 Language has a striking role to play in two categories of the management of such concern, vows and oracles, as well as facilitating the primary temporal awareness of the future as an approaching reality. In both, the formulation of an idea, be it an aspiration of individual or collective nature, is believed to encapsulate the 1} See Wyatt (2001) passim, and especially pp. 233-251, 271-299. ?

Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 essence of the aspiration, so that things transpire precisely in the manner described. The basis of this thinking lies in the psychology of language, and the universal belief that to name a concept somehow reifies it, gives it sub stance, and in the right circumstances allows it to be conjured up, or actual ized. Ihus, in the case of a vow, a bargain is made with higher powers, and a precise agreement on a quid pro quo basis is entered into, whereby so long as the votary fulfils his or her part of the bargain, there is the expectation, and indeed the implicit moral demand, that a deity will grant whatever is demanded. This is the very basis of folk religion, and has little spiritual force. The oracle tends to be on a higher plane. There is nothing overtly condi tional about it. From a theological perspective, it grants the principle of divine freedom,2 but assumes that access may be had to the divine will, and that this will be expressed in a comprehensible way. It reached its apogee, perhaps, in oracles such as that at Delphi, where the ambiguity of the supernatural message precluded its manipulation by the human subject. Enquire of the oracle, and you never knew what answer you would get, as Croesus found to his cost. With ancient Near Eastern oracles, that degree of sophistication had per haps not been reached, or perhaps it had, but ways had been found of manip ulating the oracle by binding it into liturgical forms, so that its ambiguity was circumscribed, and it gave precisely the expected answer.3 We should never underestimate the ability of the human mind to discover loopholes to circum vent any conditions laid down by law or custom. (Somewhere in our constitu 2) From an anthropological and psychological perspective, this is of course a trick of the mind, whereby the decision-making process may be granted an objective status. Cf. Jaynes, pp. 84-99, on the function of deities as decision-making principles. 3) The Mari oracles do not seem to have a liturgical context, being apparently instances of spon taneous reception of the divine message, which was then communicated directly to the king. However, in view of the "shorthand" nature of the record, to be discussed below, we should be wary of over-interpreting this aspect (that is, underestimating the formal cultic context), though some certainly appear to have been spontaneous, that is unprompted, communications on the part of a possessed person. The much later Assyrian prophecies, for all their apparent spontane ity, appear in fairly predictable contexts (e.g. royal accessions) which presuppose a degree of control. (Cf. Mari text A1968, discussed by Durand (1993) and Wyatt (1998), pp. 841-843 = 2005b, pp. 158-160). The phenomenon in Israel is seemingly of an entirely different order, but this very impression of "uniqueness" should warn us against the danger of over-interpretation, and above all of eisegesis. But even here a cultic context is evidently to be presupposed in a num ber of places (e.g. 1 Samuel x 5; Isaiah vi; Amos v 18-27, vii 13; 2 Kings iv 25; Zechariah iii 1 ivl4, etc.). See Lindblom (1962), p. 80 and n. 54; cf. Buss (1980), pp. 7-8.</page><page sequence="3">N. Wyatt/ Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 485 tion there is a Jesuitical gene, designed to cope with the law of unintended consequences.) Something of Delphic ambiguity can be seen in some biblical oracles, even though the liturgical framework probably sought to control things there too.4 So far as Ugaritian evidence is concerned, with which we are here concerned, even the ambiguity is ambiguous in terms of the literary example discussed below-the only evidence so far discovered-which makes its subtlety particularly delicious. Perhaps one of the unstated purposes of lit erature such as BaaI, Keret and Aqhat was the exploration of just such theo logical conundra, as the poet sought to resolve such issues. The term "oracle" is used to cover a wide range of ritual techniques and literary forms,5 but I shall restrict its application in the present discussion to a fairly narrow scope. The reading of omens, celestial, mechanical (sacrificial, 4) We may cite one example: Amos' "Day of Yahweh" oracle (noted above) which takes up an expectation of an auspicious Day (a "predictable oracle") and turns it on its head. 5) Parp?la (1997), p. xiv, showed how the undifferentiated use of the term "oracle", to cover the readings from omen books and extispicy reports, as well as "inspired prophecy", blinded biblical scholars to the important witness of the latter type of material from the Assyrian archives. The material in his corpus provides an important parallel to the supposedly distinctive Israelite orac ular tradition, closer than the Mari oracles on account of their proximity in time. Whether Par p?las own estimate, that the Assyrian material witnesses to what amounted to a "mystery cult of Ishtar" (pp. xiv-xvii and later elaboration), is either tenable, or possibly a key to similar esoteric traditions in Ugarit and elsewhere, remains to be seen. In his interesting discussion, Buss distin guished between "prophetic messages" and "more mechanical divinations", noting that the for mer "deal especially with the assessment of the actual, which contains elements of particularity and the new." His definition of the prophet is useful: The role of a prophet or seer can be characterized as the receiving and transmitting of com munications not available to ordinary conscious sensitivity, which are held to come from a source (the divine) or through a form of perception transcending normal spatio-temporal limitations... (Buss (1980), pp. 7 and 6 respectively). See also Nissinen (2000, 2004). In the latter (2004, p. 23), he remarked that [p]rophetic activity does not necessarily exclude other roles in society; the social position of the prophet may vary according to the integration of the prophetic role into the society as a whole. The oft-made dichotomy between free, charismatic prophets and the so-called cultic or court prophets should no longer be upheld as a fundamental, generally applicable distinction... (Nissinen 2004, p. 23) His definition of prophecy is also worth citing in full:</page><page sequence="4">486 N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 and instrumental), and natural (appearances of birds sand animals), or even the interpretation of dreams, is not at issue here,6 but rather the uttered oracles of cultic personnel who appeared in Mari, Assyria and Israel as "prophets", who undoubtedly appeared elsewhere even if they have left no written record. M. Nissinen has categorized this material as "noninductive", in distinction from the "inductive" techniques noted above.7 In general, the writing always followed an originally oral communication, and the psychological, experien tial or ritual bases for individual oracles were varied, and often unidentified. My task here is to ascertain whether the Ugaritian material to be discussed constitutes evidence of prophecy in these terms in Ugarit. II. The Oracle in Keret (Kirta) An important episode in the Keret story from Ugarit, narrating events in the life of the king, and his rescue from the edge of extinction, only to be cast back onto the precipice at the end, is the oracle given to the king by El, in the framework of an extended blessing upon him and his dynastic line in KTU 1.15 ii 16-iii 16. On my reading, this passage was originally an entire column in length, a carefully-constructed and balanced liturgical com position, though much of it is now missing. It is this blessing, the embedded oracle and associated material which is the primary subject of the present discussion. It is given in response to a plea from Baal that El act. Baal addresses him in these terms (KTU 1.15 ii 13-16):8 Prophecy... is human transmission of allegedly divine messages. As a method of revealing the divine will to humans, prophecy is to be seen as another, yet distinctive branch of the consultation of the divine that is generally called "divination". Among the forms of divina tion, prophecy clearly belongs to the noninductive kind. That is to say, prophets?like dreamers and unlike astrologers or haruspices?do not employ methods based on system atic observations and their scholarly interpretations, but act as direct mouthpieces of gods whose messages they communicate.

This intercession by Baal, the royal god, protector of the Ugaritian monarchy, moves the supreme deity, El himself, generally regarded as the progenitor of kings, graciously to intervene to bring about the necessary resolution of Keret's problems of wifelessness and childlessness. Thus Baal takes the initiative, and a hierarchical relationship is established: Keret, Baal and El.

Their last one I shall treat as the firstborn." It is not so much the content of the oracle that concerns us here, as the form in which it is couched, the occasion of its utterance, and its relationship both to the embedding material and to other oracular material from Ugarit. I have dealt with the ideological implications of the text in various recent publications. 12 The entire narrative of Keret is without doubt to be read as an epic compo sition,13 and while like much epic it probably has a tenuous link with real historical events, to all intents we should regard it as fiction. Having said that, there is no reason to doubt that there is an essentially historical verisimilitude about its telling,14 and so it is reasonable to suppose that the formulaic lan guage in which this passage is couched draws on at least the principles, if not the very words, of actual liturgical usage in the real world. The genre is clear enough: this is an annunciation, declaring the forthcoming birth of a royal heir. But since it is formulated within the broader context of a marriage bless ing,15 and this in turn within an enthronement blessing, it anticipates all the births which will result from the present nuptials. Fecundity is a signal dem onstration of divine favour, and this marriage will be blessed with twice the ideal number of offspring (twice times seven: fourteen in all).16 So blessed will (thus many, erroneously, e.g. Tropper (2000), pp. 530-531, ?74.236.2), see Wyatt (2002), pp. 211-212 n. 155. 12) For notes on the text as translated, see Wyatt (2002), pp. 208-212. See also Wyatt (2005d). 13) See Wyatt (2005c). 14) Cf. the sociological and historical realities of the Iliad, preserved over several centuries of transmission. 15) The passage anticipates the subsequent marriage of Keret to Hurriya, and it is of her children that it speaks. 16) S.B. Parker (1989) was the first to note that in this respect it partially anticipates the circum stances and arithmetic of Job: cf. KTU 1.14 i 10-25 and the whole passage under discussion here</page><page sequence="7">N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57(2007)483-510 489 be the marriage that there will be sufficient to give the very youngest an equal measure of blessing (= wealth) with the firstborn,17 and by implication, a sim ilar measure will be accorded to all the intervening children. In short, in keep ing with the epic style, we have here, perhaps in somewhat hyperbolic terms, the very paradigm of royal felicity, with its attendant benefits for the entire nation. The theoretical structure of the whole oracle may be represented more clearly by setting the two parts (sons and daughters respectively) in parallel, thus (column two here following column one): THE LIBATION RITE [El] took a cup [in] (his) hand, a goblet in (his) [right] hand; He did indeed bless [his servant], El blessed Keret [the votary], [he gave a bless]ing to the gracious [one], heir of El: INSTRUCTION TO MARRY "Take a wife, 0 Keret, take a wife to your house, bring a sacred bride into your dwelling: ORACLE: SONS TO BE BORN I ORACLE: DAUGHTERS TO BE BORN I she will bear you [She will] come to term and bear you seven sons, [dau]ghters: and multiply them eightfold for you She will bear Yasibu the heir: with Job i 2, i 13-19 and xiii 10, 13 (reading sib'?n? as "fourteen": HALOT'w 1401 suggestion ?b). The view that it is a multiplicity of wives, not children, that is alluded to in the opening lines of Keret (thusTropper (2000), pp. 346-348 [??62.132a, 62.142a, 62.152a, 62.162a, 62.172a], p. 370 [?63.32], p. 570 [?74.424]) would tend to destroy this parallel. But as I have argued, (Wyatt (2002), p. 181, n. 19) the argument is finely balanced. I suspect that I am now (2006) edging towards the position of Tropper and Pardee, but the present passage under discussion still presents something of a problem for the view, with its emphasis on the children, perhaps twice an original number. 17) There is no warrant for reading into the final line a reversal of the blessing: the last instead of the first, as though the first (sc. Yasibu) is to be disinherited or displaced. The fact that this is the outcome will also reverse the blessing on the youngest. See Wyatt (2002), p. 212 n. 157.</page><page sequence="8">490 N.

Tfhis is so nicely balanced in broad formal terms, despite there remaining many questions about the exact content of the section listing the sons (some fifteen lines may be missing overall)'9 that we may legitimately ask whether we have here a liturgical passage in the form of an antiphony, each part carefully balancing the essential elements in the other part in an oral expression, even though they are sequential.20 The chiastic arrangement emphasizes this 18) We may surmise that this is the name of the second son; or perhaps it is the seventh? The name occurs at KTU 1.16 i 46, 58, ii 33 and is probably to be restored in the missing section at the end of 1.15 vi (it is presumably Ilhu who is speaking in 1.16 i 2-11, 14-23, and is addressed in 1.16 i 25-45) as well as in 1.16 ii 17, 21. 19) If we suppose that there was more to the language concerning Yasibu, say nine lines, allowing six further ones for the listing of the further sons (as with the daughters), then the gap may be adequately accounted for. This remains speculative, of course. 20) Cf. the same nicely balanced antiphonal structure in Deuteronomy xxviii 1-14 and 15-35 (the latter section subsequently greatly expanded in the light of exilic experience, w. 36-68).</page><page sequence="9">N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 491 quality.21 The form strongly reinforces the content of the message, and the final blessing on the youngest daughter,22 which is to prove so ironic in the story of Keret, is emphasized by its isolation, having no counterbalancing part in the first half of the blessing. On the other hand, it does rather nicely balance the initial blessing of Yasibu, the heir, who is to be suckled by goddesses, in addition to offering a complement concerning the girl as striking as the language used of the son. The formal architecture of this passage indicates the culmination of a com plex redactional process, whereby what may have originated as a fairly simple oracle, albeit already of a common type,23 foretelling the birth of a child, has been progressively elaborated, with the initial divine blessing formula (a different genre), the instruction to marry (yet another genre), the oracle concerning offspring, elaborated into multiplication of offspring, the balance between male and female children, and its embedding within (pre-existing?) promises of divine benevolence and blessing, to say nothing of the strong ideological bias because it is royal in application, has reached its present final stage. This is the use of stereotypical language within the context of an epic poem, with its own distinctive bias and function within the royal ideology of Ugarit.24 I am not asserting this as a means of implying a long prehistory of the text. For all we know, the ratiocination may have gone on in the head of Ili milku. Its complexity suggests, however, that he took some time to achieve the final text of his composition, much of which may well have been based on traditional material. Cf. the chiastic analysis proposed above in Wyatt (2006a): 1 1.15 ii 16-20 Introductory formulaic account of blessing rite; 2 1.15 ii 21-24 Promise of offspring; a 3 1.15 ii 25-28 Yasibu (eldest) will be a suckling of goddesses; b [4 1.15 ii xxx lacuna of ca 15 lines, probably list of seven sons; c] 5 1.15 iii 2-4 promise of membership of the rpum; d 6 1.15 iii 5-12 list of seven daughters; cl 7 1.15 iii 13-15 promise of membership of the rpum; dj 8 1.15 iii 16 the youngest daughter will be as blessed as the first; bl 9 1.15 iii 17-19 the gods bless Keret and depart. ^ 22) The concept of an eighth daughter, conveniently named "Octavia" (ttmnt), is a figment of modern eisegesis: see Wyatt (2002), pp. 211-212 n. 155. 23) Numerous Ugaritic and biblical examples exist of the type: see below. 24) On Keret as an Ugaritian epic, see Wyatt (2005c).</page><page sequence="10">492 N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 As Jackson and Dressler demonstrated,25 the passage concerning the cup of blessing in 11. 16-20 recurs in Aqhat (KTU 1.17 i 34-36), where its presence was hitherto unrecognized because of haplography. The fact that it occurs twice establishes its formulaic nature.26 In the case of its incidence in Aqhat, the wedding context is not assumed, since Danel and Dantiy are already mar ried. Perhaps it is fair to say that the literary force of the formula in that con text is precisely the huge efficacy of a royal marriage blessing as a means of solving a gynaecological problem. (Men are never blamed for infertility in ancient literature!) Indeed, since the situation in Aqhat is a special case, while in Keret it is paradigmatic, or universal, we may ask whether the original Sitz im Leben was, as in the latter, in a nuptial context. The blessing formula itself in Keret now lies as a framework around the oracle concerning offspring, however, in a fairly obvious way. This can be seen by the excision of the oracle. We then have this sequence: [El] took a cup [in] (his) hand, a goblet in (his) [right] hand; He did indeed bless [his servant], El blessed Keret [the votary], [he gave a bless]ing to the gracious [one], heir of El: Be greatly exalted, Keret, among the Saviours of the underworld, in the convocation of the assembly of Ditanu. 25) Jackson and Dressier (1975). See also Wyatt (2002), p. 260 n. 42, for summary of their argument. 26) It reads remarkably like the words of eucharistie institution: "On the night that he was betrayed..." The essential identity of the two passages in Keret and Aqhat is clear from the following syn opsis (see Wyatt (2002), p. 208 and n. 143 and p. 260 and n. 42?following Jackson and Dressier?for further discussion): KTU 1.15 ii 16-20 KTU 1.17 i 34-&lt;-&gt;-36 ks.yihd[il.b]yd [ks] yihd.il&lt; byd(h) krpn.bm [ym]n krpn.bmymn(h) brkm.ybrk [bdh]. brkm.ybrk &gt; 'bdh ybrk.il.krt [t] ybrk [il.dni]I.mt.rpi [ym]rm.nm[n.]glm.il ymr.gzr [mt h]rnmy</page><page sequence="11">N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 493 We thus find, rather surprisingly, that the oracle is in all probability secondary to the blessing, or rather that in the composition of Keret, Ilimilku has taken a stereotyped blessing formula, perhaps from the enthronement liturgy, and used it to frame the oracular element (which may have originated in another liturgy, presumably one of birth-or rather conception-announcement). The same author (it could only convincingly be the same author) has then used the same formula in the composition of Aqhat, though the latter part, concerning the Rapiuma, was not included, since an alternative formulation was used (KTU 1.17 i 36-38): El took [a cup] &lt;in (his) hand: a goblet in (his) right hand; he did indeed bless&gt; his servant, [El] blessed [Dane]l, the man of healing, he gave a blessing to the hero, [the devotee of H] rnm: "By my life! Danel, [the man of heal] ing, shall live! by my vitality the hero, the devotee of Hrnm! [May] it [go] well with him! It is noteworthy that in Keret the tricolon Be greatly exalted, Keret, among the Saviours of the underworld, in the convocation of the assembly of Ditanu. now follows each list of children (male and female respectively-this is seen particularly clearly in the synoptic arrangement) and as it were sums up the burden of each birth-list: such fecundity is a portent of Keret's inclusion among the agents of royal fertility. They themselves will honour him for his prowess. Thus the editorial process causes the fundamental blessing, the king's exaltation among the Rapiuma (whose Sitz im Leben was the enthronement), to be modified into one concerning offspring. The literary form used in this reiterated formula, with its peculiar emphasis, invites some further consideration on the role of the Rapiuma.27 It is striking 27) For previous recent discussion, see Rouillard (1995); id. (2005); and Wyatt (forthcoming). One point to bear in mind is that though the Vorlage of Keret may well originate in eastern Syria (at Khabur on the Balik), the ideology contained in this formula belongs firmly within Ugaritian usage (cf. KTU 1.108, 1.161). This is not to deny the possibility that the ideology may have also been current in Khabur. Ditanu after all indicates an Assyrian aspect to the tradition. For the</page><page sequence="12">494 N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 that Keret appears to be envisaged as being among their number. While the time-scale involved here is indeterminate, it is even possible that he is to be numbered among them while still alive, apparently an unparalleled honour, since they are dead kings.28 However, if my analysis of the development of the passage is cogent, this formed part of the original blessing formula into which the oracular material has subsequently been inserted, and may in fact have constituted a formal blessing of the kings of Ugarit in some such context as their enthronement, as it were proleptically marking the solidarity between deceased kings and their present successor, but with no element of hyperbole. The Rapiuma are agents in the elevation of the king to his new status. Text KTU 1.108 invokes the god rpu mlk 'Im, which I have translated as "Rapiu, King of eternity",29 or more recently, as proposed by H. Niehr,30 as "Rapiu, King of the Hereafter". This modified version follows the insights of Niehr and del Olmo concerning the specifically royal function of this deity. Rapiu is a Rhadamanthine figure,31 lord of the underworld, and patron of the dead kings who have joined his company there, where they continue to be involved in the affairs of the living through kispum rites and royal funerals (e.g. KTU 1.1 13, where only non-rpum kings are named, and 1.161). It would be entirely appropriate for a king's ideological link with them to be emphasized at his enthronement. The element mlk in Rapiu's mode of address is more than just titular; it invites us to see him as an alter ego to the deity Milku or Maliku (mlk) appear ing in the pantheon-lists, KTU 1.47.33 = 1.1 18.32 = RS 20.24.32. In the Ugaritic versions he appears in a plural form, as mlkm (malikuima?), while in the Akkadian version the form is dma.lik.mes, confirming the plural reading. In KTU 1.161.11, 12, the deceased Ammithtamru and Niqmaddu (sc. II) are both designated mlk, which led del Olmo to see a theological content in the term.32 The reference to Milku (Maliku) of Athtarat in 1.107.42 is undoubt edly to the same god, since this city was linked with Rapiu in 1. 108.2-3, where Rapiuma as possibly linked through their eponym to the later Greek Titans, see discussion in Wyatt (forthcoming). 28) Pace L'Heureux (1979).

Their invocation in KTU 1.161, where they are summoned into the threshold of the tomb to greet Niqmaddu III-IV as his corpse is lowered into the tomb,35 shows the solidarity in the royal cult between kingship past and present, with implications for the future. Keret receives a divine commitment to include him in their number. Let us now consider the mechanics of the procedures, particularly with reference to the oracular element. In the fictional context, El is presented as directly addressed himself, and as directly addressing Keret in the granting of this powerful blessing. This describes an ideal situation. That is, it is a simplification of the real process, by means of a paradigmatic presentation. It may be compared with the following biblical sequence from 2 Samuel ii 1-2: Now after this David enquired of Yahweh, "shall I go up to one of the cities of Judah?" And Yahweh replied, "Go on up." Then David said, "to which one shall I go up?" And he replied, "To Hebron". This appears superficially to be a straightforward conversation between David and Yahweh. In reality, of course, it is stylistic shorthand for an account of an oracular technique such as the Urim and Tummim,36 framing questions to elicit a "yes" or "no" response, which we see more directly represented in this sequence: Then Saul said to all Israel, "Stand on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side."! And all the people replied, 'Do as you think fit.' Then Saul said to Yahweh, "God of Israel, why did you not answer your servant today? If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, give Urim; if the fault is with your people Israel, give Tummim." Jonathan and Saul were identified, and the people were free. Then Saul said, "Let the lot be cast between me and Jonathan my son." And Jonathan was identified. (1 Samuel xiv 40-42, txx). 33) See discussion in (2006b). 34) Note that the Rapiuma do not appear in the king-list of KTU 1.113. 35) Cf. the ironical use of the motif in Isaiah xiv 9 discussed in Wyatt (2006b). 36) On this procedure see the interesting explanation of Robertson (1964).

Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 On the analogy of this material and its literary presentation, the appearance of a direct communication in Keret may simply point to a more complex tech nique, as in the biblical examples here adduced. We cannot be certain of the ritual process underlying the sequence from Keret. We can only compare it with other annunciation and blessing accounts, which may offer some clues. The following annunciations all conform to a common pattern: KTU 1.12.14 30 (annunciation), 1.13.22-29 (blessing), 1.17 i 34-47++ (Aqhat: annuncia tion and blessing), 1.24.7?37 (Nikkal's pregnancy); Genesis xvi 10-12 (Ishmael: annunciation and blessing),38 Genesis xvii 1-19 (Isaac), Judges xiii 2-20 (Sam son), 1 Samuel i 12-18 (Samuel), Psalm xix 2-7 = Evv 1-6 (mythic account of the king's birth);39 Isaiah xiv 7 (Abijah's pregnancy with Hezekiah)40 and even Luke i 26-38 (the annunciation to Mary). In varying measures, they appear to reflect liturgical conventions in such matters. In each case, the fiction has it that the deity speaks directly or through a messenger (mlak, mdl'dk, "angel") to the subject. The Sitz im Leben of such narratives, typically royal in origin (the divine examples merely typify the ideological basis of the material), is the demand for royal heirs and oracles designed to affirm good news. But the question remains, how were such divine messages received in the first place?41 We have noted how a seemingly normal conversational presenta tion may be an implicit allusion to a ritual technique, as with the Urim and Tummim. Can we pinpoint an Ugaritian or more widely attested convention specific to oracular usage? For one of the interesting implications of our dis cussion about this literary, fictitious oracle, is that familiarity with its genre implies the existence of oracular procedures, that is prophecy, in Ugarit, even though other direct evidence for it has not so far been identified. Its presence in Mari and Assyria and elsewhere should have led us to expect it, in any event. Only against the background of familiarity with the phenomenon could Keret have made sense to its hearers. The material to which we now turn cor roborates this intuition, by providing further circumstantial evidence for the existence of prophecy in Ugarit. 37) On the tense problem, see Wyatt (2002), p. 337 n. 10.

An Oracular Formula in Baal and Its Implications for Ugaritian and Biblical Thought An important formulaic sequence, having perhaps a significant bearing on the question of oracles and the means of their transmission, recurs a number of times in Baal, though not in our present context, Keret. It is however of some interest for the present discussion. The passage appears thus: dm rgm it ly wargmk hwt watnyk rgm s wlZht abn rgm ltd' nsvm wltbn hmlt ars. tantsvmm 'm ars thmt.

I understand the lightning which the heavens do not know: come, and I shall reveal it in the midst of my divine mountain Saphon, in the sanctuary, in the rock of my inheritance. It occurs in these passages: KTU 1.1 ii 1-3, fragmentary, [1.1 ii 22-end?], 1.1 iii 10-16, and 1.3 iii 19-31, all with lacunae, from which the com plete version above is reconstructed.42 In these contexts, it belongs with two ritual programmes I have characterized as "the burial ritual" and "the spear ritual". The present sequence I have called "the cosmic secret". In my earlier study, I proposed that at least in conceptual terms it underlay the language of Psalm xix 3-5.43 The context of both the Ugaritic and biblical passages here noted is the practice of royal ideology. This is the best overall explanation of 42) For a previous treatment in the broader context of message formulations addressed by one deity to another, see Wyatt (1995), pp. 575-579 = (2005b), pp. 116-19. 43) 'en '?mer There is no speech we'?n deb?r?m and there are no words: b'i? nisma q?l?m quite unheard is their voice. bekol-ha ?res y?sa \qaww?m (But) from the whole earth goes forth their voice ?biqes? t?b?l mill?hem and from the ends of the world their utterance. t mt; or emend to * q?l?m</page><page sequence="16">498 N.

Of considerable interest in this passage is the bicolon introducing the stro phe on the "cosmic secret": a word of tree (s) and a whisper of stone (abn) ... I think, for reasons that I shall enlarge on, that we should maintain this trans lation, in spite of the fact that there are numerous biblical echoes such as Exodus xix 4, Leviticus xix 4, xxvi 1, Deuteronomy iv 15-19, 28*, v 8, 15, xxviii 36*, 64*, xxix 16* (EW 17*), Isaiah xliv 9-20, xlvi 1-7, Jeremiah ii 27*, iii 9*, Ezekiel xx 32*,46 which evoke what the Bible and its interpreters inter pret as the worst excesses of "idolatry" in its maximal sense, the use of any visual form to represent the divine. (And yet how material is the verbal imag ery of the Hebrew Bible, just as it is in the present passage!) Two of the chief iconic forms used in Israelite religion, to judge from the reiterated attacks on them, the '1ernh and the masseddh, were precisely in the media of wood ( es) and stone ('eben) respectively. Should we not replace "tree" by "wood" in the Ugaritic bicolon, and frankly recognize its explicitly material nature? I think not. For while the biblical iconoclasm makes for splendid rhetoric, it is often at the expense of a fair representation of the object of its ire.47 Hosea iv 12 reads: ammi beceso'yis'dl My people enquires of its tree umaq16 yaggid 1d and its rod instructs it On the integrity of this passage, without the necessity of excising v. 4 as a later interpolation, see Wyatt (1995), p. 567 n. 13 = (2005b), p. 110 n. 13, and on the reading qaww?ml*qol?m, (1995), p. 571 = (2005b), pp. 112-113. 44) See M.

Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 499 a passage commonly taken to be a graphic example of deliberate distortion of the reality for polemical purposes, as in J. R. Porter's version (1981, p. 203):48 My people enquire from a block of wood, and their rod gives them oracles... Though it is not obligatory to read the text of Hosea in this way, it is probably a fair inference, given his polemical style. The Ugaritic text must be seen strictly in its own context, and though there is indeed an element of materialism in the choice of figure, we should recog nize in this an irreducible element in all attempts at religious experience and communication. How else can the human mind (sc. the brain in functional mode) perceive49 the transcendent and the abstract except through the con crete and the tangible? The very foundation of all symbolic expression is phys ical experience: sight, smell, sound, taste and touch. The language of this Ugaritic passage takes us to the very core of religious expression. The language of the text in Baal is allusive, and not perhaps to be easily pinned down. The first part, "a word of tree", may indeed relate to the use of trees, sc. their material, in the construction of icons and other religious objects. But another intriguing possibility arises if we see the allusion as relating to a number of specific biblical oracular traditions. Because it is probably the living tree, or the tree as medium of hierophany, and similarly, the stone as "living rock", as in a sacred mountain or stela, and not merely the material substance, which is the occasion of oracular revelation. The chief characteristic will have been the numinous quality of the location. We may well ask whether the biblical formula understanding it to be a question of "wood... and stone" was not ultimately derived from the formula as attested in Ugarit (i.e., not necessarily directly from Ugarit), so that its original force would be not so much the materiality of the items, as their oracular function.50 The entire iconoclastic tradition may have originated ini tially as a rejection of rival oracles. 48) J. R. Porter cited Mays (1969), p. 73. Cf. JPS (on a different syntax): It consults its sticks, its rod directs it! 49) I use the term advisedly. It is the language of theology, and of religious experience. From a behavioural and cultural perspective, we should say "construct". I am happy with either term. 50) Mobley (2005), pp. 93-101, offered a perceptive analysis of the pesilim of the story of Ehud, Judges iii 15-30.</page><page sequence="18">500 N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 Let us note the rich tradition of oracular trees in particular in the Old Tes tament. In Genesis xii 6 we read that Abram, newly arrived in the Levant after his prolonged migration from Ur and Haran, came to Shechem: wayyacabir 'abrdm bd'dres 'ad meqom sekem 'ad 'ldn mreh. .. Then Abram travelled through the country to the shrine5' of Shechem, to the "Teacher's Oak".52 This "sacred" tree (for it evidently had a specifically religious nature) is men tioned a number of times in biblical tradition. In Deuteronomy xi 30 it is mentioned almost gratuitously as a significant focal point in the Israelites' migration; in Genesis xxxv 2-4, part of a narrative which contextualizes the pre-Israelite tradition of Genesis xxxiv,53 a significant ritual break with the past is sealed with the burial of various divine images (kol-'eldhe hannekAdr, "all the foreign gods")54 under the tree. This perhaps explains the earlier "gratuitous" reference, for the location functions as the interface between old and new dispensations. The tree features yet again in Joshua xxiv 26-32, where it is, perhaps with great significance, the place at which Joshua sets up a great stone ('eben ged6ldh: the term massebdh is studiously avoided) under (tahat)55 the tree as a ritual accompaniment to the writing of the Law (mispdt). Finally, though the text is not explicit, we may suppose that it was the location of the burial of Joseph's bones (v. 32). Now what precisely was the "oak (or: terebinth) of Moreh"? The latter term means "teacher". Was this an oracular tree? Did a seer sit underneath it to receive and dispense divine guidance? What were the mechanics of the process? Hebron was also the location of a group of famous sacred trees, appearing in a number of narratives. In Genesis xiii 18 Abram settles at the oaks (plural) at Mamre, "which are at Hebron";56 in xiv 13 he is living at the oaks "of 51) It is likely that m?q?m has its specialized sense of a religious sanctuary here, as in Genesis xxviii (see Wyatt 1990b). 52) "(T)he Hill of [Oracular] Seeing": Mobley (2005), p. 138. 53) See Wyatt (1990a). 54) And rather oddly, their earrings. Presumably these had religious significance, or were of gold, and thus formed part of a sacred depositional hoard. Cf.

Beersheba was the site of a tamarisk tree planted by Abraham (clearly an aetiology) in Genesis xxi 33, where he invoked Yahweh El Olam. He built an altar there following a theophany in xxvi 23-25, and Jacob ("Israel") sacrificed there in xlvi 1. 'The tree is not mentioned in the latter two passages, but per haps the three belong together in terms of the presuppositions of the tradition: tree and altar belonged together as elsewhere. Yet another tree, known as "the Oak of Weeping", features at Genesis xxxv 8, as the site of the burial of Rachel's nurse Deborah, near Bethel. This tree fea tured too at 1 Kings xiii 14. Since this Deborah was an entirely insignificant character in the tradition, we may well ask whether this tree is really to be identified with the following example from outside the Genesis narrative. Or perhaps it was originally Rebekah who was interred here. The present aeti 58 ology is opaque. Another tradition (Judges iv 5) is told of another Deborah, numbered among the judges of Israel: uhi yosvebet tahat-tomer debordh wayyacalu &amp;eihd bene yisrdjl lammispdt Now she sat beneath "Deborahs Palm" and all the Israelites went up to her for justice. Is this to be identified with the tree near Bethel, even though now two names are used? Yet another tradition, in Judges vi, concerns Gideon. An angel came and sat under an oak tree at Ophrah (v. 11), appearing to Gideon in a theophany (v. 12), and delivering a message. Gideon subsequently offered food to the angel under the tree (vv. 19-21) and erected an altar (v. 24, though not explic itly in relation to the tree).59 A further example occurs in 1 Kings xix 4-8, where the fleeing Elijah rested under a broom tree and was ministered to by an angel, suggesting that the tradition understood it to involve a theophany. 57) Discussed briefly at Oesterley and Robinson (1937), pp. 30-31. 58) Oesterley and Robinson (1937), p. 28, suggested that the tree was the location for "weeping for Tammuz" rites. Note how the listing of the trees amounts to a gazetteer of sacred sites in Palestine with known or alleged patriarchal or other heroic links. 59) Cf. Beersheba above.</page><page sequence="20">502 N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 Finally, perhaps one of the most important instances from the point of view of Israelite (&gt; Jewish) religious history was the narrative of the burning bush at which Moses encountered God in Exodus iii, and where Yahweh spoke from the middle of the plant, which I have argued was consciously modelled on and intended to represent the temple Menorah.60 Deuteronomy xxxiii 16 alludes to this tradition in the expression ureson sokene sene, ".... and the favour of the one dwelling in the bush" (sc. Yahweh), indicating that the deity was under stood to reside in some fashion within the tree. The same questions arise concerning the function of all these trees. They evidently had a religious significance, and there is no sense of a conscious ten sion between their mention and the iconoclastic language we have noted. But the presence of the latter in the tradition highlights their authentic nature as witnesses to the same kind of religiosity as we have found in Ugaritian tradi tion. It therefore seems entirely reasonable to interpret the two bodies of evidence, biblical and Ugaritic, as examples of the same broad phenomenon. With the exception of the burning bush, they are all associated with sacred sites, presumably sanctuaries. The burning bush is a special case, intended to evoke the sacrality of Jerusalem, and apply it to the end-of-the-world, liminal place of exile. It is in any case a purely literary construct. 'The "Teacher's Tree" at Shechem61 and "Deborah's Palm" (aka "the Oak of Weeping"?) seem to offer most for an understanding of the function of the tree, while the latter, Moses' bush and the Gideon narrative explicitly link the tree with a divine communication,62 and perhaps assist our understanding of its significance in the Ugaritic formula. 60) The narrative is an exilic composition, but has become the paradigm of revelation for the whole editorial tradition of the Hebrew Bible. See Wyatt (1979) = (2005a), pp. 6-12; id., (1986) = (2005a), pp. 13-17; id., (1999a) = (2005b), pp. 191-220. 61) Oesterley and Robinson (1937), pp. 26-27, observed that one cannot fail to recognize a connexion between the mention of a specific, and obviously well-known, tree and the divine appearance there. The tree was regarded as sacred. Abra ham halts at it because he expects a divine manifestation there... The same must be postu lated of the terebinth of Mamre... In the case of the tamarisk tree in Beersheba which Abraham is said to have planted (Gen. xxi. 33) one might well ask, What is the point of his doing so? But this is in all probability a later tradition to explain the presence of an ancient tree sanctuary. The verse must be read in connexion with Gen. xxvi. 23-35, which describes a theophany in the same place, but where the tree is not mentioned (cp. Gen. xlvi. 1). 62) In the case of Deborah, the tree is the locus of a legal procedure. But it is hard to imagine this not involving a theological dimension.</page><page sequence="21">N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 503 Early anthropological studies saw sacred trees (and especially oaks, which feature in most instances here)63 as a routine locus of supernatural revelation.64 Oesterley and Robinson offered some interesting observations in line with views of the time concerning sacred trees mentioned in the Bible.65 In a survey of Arab practice ancient and modern, they cited Doughty, who observed of tree-cults among the Bedouin: Sometimes the tree is believed to speak with an inarticulate voice, as the gharcad did in a dream to Moslim; but except in a dream it is obvious that the voice of the tree can only be some rustling sound, as the wind in the branches.66 They then examined the various biblical passages. Ihey opined that so far as mechanics were concerned, it would be the wind rustling the foliage of the tree which would indicate the presence of the deity. Their parade example was 2 Samuel v 23-24, to be treated below. They observed that: It is quite clear from this passage that the belief was held that Yahweh entered the trees, His presence being indicated by the rustling. One could not have a more direct indication of animistic belief.67 There is no need to accept uncritically the old nineteenth century concept of animism espoused here and throughout their discussion by these authors, unless it be updated according to the discussion of Guthrie 1993, in which the underlying principle was the universality of anthropomorphism, and thus the metaphorical experience of the natural world as medium for revelation. But they were probably correct in seeing these surprisingly numerous allusions as evidence of archaic features in Israelite religion, still apparently endorsed by the later tradition, and thus in tension with the aniconic imperative.68 There 63) Of course the species of oak or terebinth (V l?h, '?l?n, 'all?n), primarily evergreen varieties, mentioned in the Hebrew texts are not the same as that or those featuring in European cultic tradition (in England and northern Europe, the deciduous Quercus Robur). 64) Robertson Smith (1927), pp. 191-197 etc. 65) Oesterley and Robertson (1937), pp. 23-32, with references to earlier studies.

This insistence on the sacrality of trees is not so far removed from our broader royal concerns noted above. For the tree was a central symbol of mon archy in the ancient Near East.70 Not only was the king of Assyria intimately involved in the regular cult of the tree as symbol of his nurture of the com munity 7' but he was seen as an aspect of it. When Nebuchadrezzar of Babylon dreamt of a tree, and Daniel explained, "that tree is yourself, 0 king", we undoubtedly have a faithful reflection of Babylonian ideology.72 While none of the biblical characters noted here were kings, Abra(ha)m was a patriarch,73 while Deborah and Gideon were judges, an office involving political rule as well as magistracy, and were therefore "virtual" monarchs. King Saul, however, sat (or "was enthroned") under a tamarisk tree at Gibeah (1 Samuel xxii 6), while his bones were buried beneath a tamarisk (1 Samuel xxxi 13) or a tere binth (1 Chronicles x 12) in Jabesh. And in 2 Samuel v 23-24 (cf. 1 Chronicles xiv 15) King David asked for a message from Yahweh concerning tactics in the Philistine war; it may be that the Urim and Tummin were used, since a nega tive answer was given, on the yes-no principle, but the answer continued: He (Yahweh) replied, "Do not go up, but encircle them and attack them opposite the bdkd' (trees).74 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the bdkd' (trees), then attack, for at that moment Yahweh will be going in front of you to attack the Philistine camp." 69) Wyatt (2002), p. 163; see n. 6 ad loc. 70) Wyatt (2001), pp. 166-172. 71) B.

Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 505 The sound, presumably of the wind in the trees, was evidently an oracular response, but secondarily indicated as significant before the event by another procedure. By nature the interpretation of the wind would be an esoteric craft known only to ritual specialists. This much is implicit in the Ugaritic formula, which continues, a word unknown to men, and which multitudes of the earth do not understand... which the heavens do not know... Secrets are revealed in this technique to which even many of the gods are not privy!75 There is a hierarchical dimension here, which is ultimately to be identified as royal. In nearly all the biblical cases (Shechem, Beersheba, Hebron, Ophrah, Gibeah, Jerusalem [the "real" locus of the burning bush, represented by the menorah]), the intimate link between tree and altar or other feature of a cult centre in the tradition shows that these arboreal oracles were controlled and maintained by the cultic personnel at the sanctuary in question. It would be natural for a central political authority to want to control such powerful manifestations of divine self-disclosure, for the benefit of the whole com munity, but above all in the interests of the king. It is no accident that in the Ugaritic material which we have considered, royal interests were always paramount.76 75) Cf. KTU 1.3 i (14-15) and discussion in Wyatt (2002), p. 71 nn. 6, 7. 76) The question is certainly worth asking, though this is not the place to answer it, as to whether the cult of the asherah in Israel and Judah was a means by which royal oracles were delivered. This would have brought together a number of factors, and also explained a number of outstand ing problems. We have drawn attention here to the frequency with which tree oracles occur in the biblical texts, and to the explicitly or implicitly royal nature of such occurrences. The asherah as a cult-object, generally accepted as a stylized, worked, or surrogate tree, is associated histori cally with royal traditions (that is narratives specifically concerning royal cultic policy, and is probably inseparable from the fortunes of the goddess Asherah as a royal goddess in both king doms (and with the status of the Gebirah as her avatar). With the demise of the monarchy at the exile, the cult of Asherah seems to have disappeared, and at the same time any oracular function it had would also have ceased. The disappearance of the occasion for royal oracles (it is notewor thy how much post-exilic prophecy was concerned with expectations of a restoration under Zerubbabel) also accounts in part for the apparent decline in prophecy in general. There must have been an extensive change in the functions of cult personnel in the light of the new circum stances of Persian hegemony.</page><page sequence="24">506 N. Wyatt/ Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 The final tricolon cited above in the oracular formula from Baal, come, and I shall reveal it in the midst of my divine mountain Saphon, in the sanctuary, in the rock of my inheritance occurs only in the last example of the citation, in KTU 1.3 iii 19-31, in which it is Baal who addresses Anat. It is plausible, given the strict lien between the giving of an oracle and the appropriate (sacred) place at which it is revealed, to conclude that this is integral to the whole formula (so that it is formulaically adapted to the other contexts). If we concede this point, further implications follow. Firstly, its association with an inheritance suggests that it is concerned with the transmission of property rights. This is a particular feature of royal usage, whence its use in Baa!, a royal ideological composition,77 and political usage in Israelite tradition, concerned with national claims to territory (of most significance in the context of an Ugaritic Vorlage are Deuteronomy xxxii 9 and associated texts). And the patriarchal narratives (e.g. Genesis xii 7, xiii 14-18 etc.) provide territorial markers, as it were. Secondly, the thrust of the usage in Baal concerns the ideological signifi cance of Mount Saphon in Ugaritian cosmology, and undoubtedly its implicit identification with the seat of royal power in the palace complex of the city. This theme was taken up in particular in Psalm xlviii 3 with its treatment of the sacred mountain in Jerusalem.79 We are still left with the procedural question not finally answered. For I am not claiming that the "tree and stone" formulation was necessarily the channel for the communications underlying the language we have analysed in Keret and Aqhat. It is a possibility. Another possibility, given the involvement of the Rapiuma in the ritual life of the king, is that some necromantic involvement of Ugarit's dead kings was also a channel for oracular expression. But again, the witness is silent, beyond some liturgical hints as in KTU 1.20-22, 1.108 77) Wyatt (2000) = (2005b), pp. 221-230 and references cited. 78) HALOT ii 687-688 (with bibliographical references) identifies 222 examples in the OT, of which 46 are in Numbers and 50 in Joshua: even allowing for their genre, these are striking statistics. 79) On the relation of Zion to Saphon and Memphis in Psalm xlviii 3, see Wyatt (1996), pp. 31 33. This seems to be a conscious appropriation of the omphalic claims of these other world centres.</page><page sequence="25">N. Wyatt / Vetus Testamentum 57 (2007) 483-510 507 and 1.161. Other possibilities (discussed in del Olmo 1999-see index) have been noted above. A third line of approach would be to insist on the presentation of the nar ratives themselves, to the effect that a spontaneous, unprovoked theophany issued in gratuitous promises from the chief god El to his son the king. But again, it is reasonable to respond to this by seeing it as a further shorthand presentation of more complex, manipulative, ritual procedures. 'When already set within established liturgical traditions, as identified above, we are already at some remove from the original circumstances of any prototypes. What we have seen in Keret and Baal is literary evidence of a phenomenon not hitherto recognized in Ugaritian culture. The following observation of Nissinen (2004, p. 25) is perhaps relevant here: a definition of prophecy should not a priori exclude the literary products that emerged from the scribal interpretations of prophetic words. Rather, these should be considered secondary prolongation of the prophetic communication process. He went on (id., p. 27) to draw attention to evidence from Wenamun, with reference to eleventh century prophecy in Byblos, to the inscription of Zakkur of Hamath (Syria, ca 800 BCE), to the Balaam inscriptions at Deir Alla (ca 700 BCE), to the contemporary Ammonite citadel oracle and an allusion in P. Amhurst 63, an Aramaic text, as evidence over a considerable period for West Semitic forms of prophecy.80 Ugarit was thus in no way an isolated case, but now provides one more piece of the mosaic that scholars are slowly reconstructing.
