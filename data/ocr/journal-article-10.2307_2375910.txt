By George Stuart Fullerton, Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy in the University of Pennsylvania. Published for the Univer- sity, Philadelphia, i899. Ginn &amp; Co., Boston. Pp. viii., I54. This brochure is much more than its title would lead one to expect. The Spinozistic doctrine of immortality occupies only a small part of the volume, as the headings of the four parts show: Part I. The World of Existences; Part II. The World of Es- sences; Part III. From Bondage to Freedom; and Part IV. The Religious Element in Spinoza. Still, Professor Fullerton is jus- tified in the name he gives to the work, inasmuch as Parts I and II expound what he considers to be true Spinozism, only to show that Spinoza's personal belief in immortality was not consistent with Spinoza's philosophic creed. Not that this philosophic creed was consistent with itself. "Spinoza was at heart a thorough realist; he thought like a real- ist, he felt like a realist, he wrote like a realist." Now, "the diffi- culty with which the realist has to contend, is that he is dealing in his reasonings with abstractions, and yet fails to see all that is im- plied in their being abstractions. His essences or universals tend not to remain essences, but to become, in some sense, existences. And they are necessarily inconsistent and unreal existences, whose incoherent and irresponsible behavior as they make their entrances and exits into the real world and out of it, produce a feeling of bewilderment in lovers of clear and consistent thinking" (p. 33). Spinoza, "of course, did not clearly recognize that his essences are abstractions. Had he done this, he would not have turned them into things. But then we should not have had the Spinozistic philosophy" (p. 34). Readers of Professor Fullerton's previous works will recognize in this condemnation a consistent carrying out of what he calls "moderate realism." Into the philosophical merits of this doctrine it is perhaps not proper to go in the pages of this JOURNAL, although a reviewer may be pardoned the dog- matic assertion that the luminousness of the exposition Professor Fullerton gives to his view is apt to blind one's eyes to the radical logical defect of it. Against such a view it may be said that a universal that is neither an abstraction nor an independent exist- ence seems to be the very presupposition of any valid reasoning and has the most striking resemblance to one form of Spinoza's</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews. 403 essence. That Spinoza, however, was not consistent in his view of essence, Professor Fullerton has probably proved, although he has not convincingly shown that Spinozism is inconsistent with any consistent view of the universal. Professor Fullerton takes a truer philosophical attitude in his treatment of the doctrine of immortality. To make transition with- out more ado from eternity to everlastingness is inadmissible; and this is true, whether we take eternity to be "the independence of time-relations enjoyed by universals" as abstractions (p. 75), or to be a transcendence of mere sequence on the part of concrete universals. Whether Spinoza committed this fallacy or not, it is a real service to clear thinking to have pointed out the paralogism involved in this procedure, and this service is the more useful and timely as many a thinker of the present day argues confidently from some form of timelessness to permanence through time. The religious element in Spinoza is traced by Professor Fuller- ton to logically unwarranted associations that were brought from a religious past to an absolutely irreligious view. In true Spinozism "God or Nature becomes nothing more than nature; and it is only a traditional use of language and the associations that have been inherited with it that cast over nature the veil through which it is seen as a fitting object to arouse religious emotion" (p. I38). "The religious emotion which pervades the 'Ethics' evidently does not flow from the concepts and reasonings which characterize Spinozism as a system of doctrine. It is found where it is because Spinoza was a man of religious nature and theological training, who did not wholly break with the past, but liberally modified inherited concepts, while habitually using lan- guage rich in associations and well calculated to conceal both from himself and from his readers the actual degree of divergence between his thoughts and generally accepted notions to which they seem to bear a certain superficial resemblance. The wine which he serves is new wine, but it is contained in old bottles, and even he is not aware how new it is. Had he clearly recognized just what, in his doctrine, is meant by the word God, had he been able to free his conception of certain irrelevant associations derived from the past, I do not believe that he would have felt toward God as it is clear he did feel" (pp. I42 and I43). All this rests on the assumption that when the word God had been divested of "every shred of anthropomorphic reference," it is no longer a word be- longing to the vocabulary of religion (p. I29). This assumption,</page><page sequence="3">404 International Journal of Ethics. in one "who would use the word religious in a broad sense," is rather surprising at this time of day; but it teaches us that in some persons at any rate, and in persons of high philosophic cul- ture, too, it is impossible for the time being to dissociate emotions from the objects that have in their past history habitually been associated with these emotions. In view of the results, however, of historical investigations into the development of religious con- sciousness, it is rather bold to assume that every religious attitude toward nature is merely a survival of anthropomorphism.
