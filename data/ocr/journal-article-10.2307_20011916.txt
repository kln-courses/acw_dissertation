<plain_text><page sequence="1">Donald C. Williams (Los Angeles), The Realistic Interpretation of Scientific Sentences: The discussions of the Congress, including especially the friendly but trenchant criticism provoked by my defense of the realistic interpretation of science, reveal how anomalous is the status among us of the positivistic theory of meaning. On the one hand, the survival of a stubborn under-current of positivism is evinced by frequent animadversions on "metaphysics" and "pseudo-problems", demands for "translations" and "reduction to perception-terms", and off-hand remarks to the effect, for instance, that "physical objects are correlations of data", or "the sciences describe com? plexes of sensations". On the other hand, however, an encouraging number of members of the group are ready explicitly to renounce this phenomenalism, while those who still habitually speak in its terms are not interested in giving it any precise formulation, or in asking whether it represents an epistemological fact. It is for them much less a scientific proposition about meaning and knowledge than a maxim to justify the focussing of research upon certain limited problems. The situation confirms my conviction that positivism has had no genuine analysis of meaning. If it had had one, it would have enunciated its result, and resolutely condemned all statements or assumptions, by scientists or others, which did not conform to it, instead of cavalierly modifying its own formulation, step by step, to adjust it to the assumptions and statements of the scientists. Such an acephalous monster can hardly be slain by a single argumentative stroke. I hope I may be forgiven, however, if I</page><page sequence="2">376 Donald E. Williams suggest that a vague and only half-sincere phenomenalism has been, and must be, as confusing and distracting as a heuristic maxim as it is fallacious as a theory of knowledge. It has contributed nothing, I think, to the specific positive achievements of the members of this Congress, and it neither implies nor is implied by what I conceive to be the chief tenets of the latter: that there are no unknowables; that only the methods of empirical science can yield knowledge of fact; that the unity of the sciences can be successfully prosecuted by logical analysis of their concepts; and that in this process, the concepts of physics are slated for a decisive r?le. We must rely principally upon experience to demonstrate the frivolity of positivism as a practical maxim. Most scientific researches might, indeed, flourish best without any theory of meaning at all; but in the meantime, there is surely room for a sober analysis of the real facts of meaning for their own sake. What I have called "the realistic analysis of meaning" is not new, but a heritage of European thought, revived and given the benefit of modern logic by "that paradigm of philosophy", Rus? sell's theory of descriptions. It is unfortunate that Russell's formula (I quote from memory), "Every proposition which we can understand must consist only of items with which we are acquain? ted", which really requires only the experiencing of the type instances (the actual experiencing of them, by me), should have been so easily misunderstood as requiring the experiencing, actual or possible, by somebody, of the denotatum. The same ambiguity is today doing mischief in such phrases as "observable predicates" and "the construction of physical concepts from perception-terms". As the first locus of our component connotata, the Eigenpsychische has an indefeasible priority; as an object of denotation it has no special prerogatives at all. Positivism errs as much by impugning the former, by suggesting, for instance, that by convention we could ground our meanings otherwise, as by misunderstanding the latter. It would be well, perhaps, to distinguish more clearly between our analysis of meaning, which permits a realistic interpretation of scientific sentences, and indeed shows that such an interpretation is the only one which would occur to a person not debauched by epistemol?gica! afterthoughts, and the conclusion, which might be called "metaphysical", that the sentences of science are, or might</page><page sequence="3">The Realistic Interpretation of Scientific Sentences J77 be, true when so interpreted. Our account of meaning, while ma? king sense of the statement that there is an Au?enwelt and that science describes it, makes equal sense of the statements that there is an Au?enwelt but science does not describe it, and that there is no Au?enwelt and science can describe only our sensations. Which of these alternatives is true is itself a genuine material question for the methods of empirical science. I believe that as a matter of fact the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of the conclusion that science, less incompetent than its friends assert, is in general a description of a real Au?enwelt. I consequently hope that our physicalism will eventually assume the duties of a straightforward empirical and naturalistic metaphysics and cosmology. The world in toto can eventually be described in physicalistic language because it is physical. Subjectivism has been the bane of scientific naturalism. As that honest empiricist, William James, said, the metaphysics of any subject is only the resolute attempt to think clearly about it. That anti-metaphysicism not only leads to muddle, but is muddle, is exhibited by the failure of the follo? wers of Mach to come to an unequivocal understanding either of him or of each other. Not metaphysics, but bad metaphysics, is the enemy of science, and as long as scientists avoid metaphysics, none of our metaphysics is likely to be scientific. A remarkable objection adduced more than once against the realistic analysis of meaning is that it is merely "psychological" or even "anthropomorphic". Now, any account of meaning is psycho? logical just to the extent to which meaning is a transaction in which a mind is involved. But not only must the positivisms reference to word-forms and verificatory data take place by the same abstrac? tive mechanism as we have described, but whereas the objects of the positivistic reference are themselves psychological, the objects of the realistic reference are in general not psychological. In our analysis, the crucial elements are the component connotata, which are neither mental nor physical, but abstract universals, and the total denotatum, which is ordinarily an independent non-mental fact. It is a kindred fundamental error, therefore, to suppose that the realistic analysis of meaning is invidiously "pictorial", "intuitive", "imaginative", or tainted with Einf?hlung. In common life, our</page><page sequence="4">37* Donald E. Williams meanings doubtless are very pictorial ? that is, we impute to our denotata relatively concrete and familiar sets of properties. But experience also contains all those very subtle, abstract, and indeter? minate structural properties which the most abstruse scientific description could require. Perhaps the worst feature of the attempt to diagram the meaning-situation is that the diagram must suggest a too gaudy and concrete understanding of the severe phrases of the scientist1). In our description of meaning, the word "meaning" means what is meant by "means" and "meant" in this sentence: that is, the relation between a statement, or part of a statement, and what it signifies, represents, designates, or describes. This is the kind of meaning which is all-important to the logic of science. I have supposed that the positivistic doctrine and the verification-theory have endeavored to establish a criterion for the presence of this kind of meaning, and that they have limited its scope either to what can be experienced or what has effects that can be experien? ced. I have argued, to the contrary, that the only criterion for meaning is meaning itself, and that its scope can not be limited a priori. This criticism has been in turn, criticized, however, on the ground that the Vienna Circle and their philosophical heirs have not been interested in meaning in this sense of "meaning", and that they have consequently never intended to assert what I have tried to refute. They have meant by "the meaning of a sentence" its importance or its usefulness. To say that an unverifiaible sentence is meaningless is thus simply to stigmatize it as scientifically un? profitable. Now, I can not believe that all, or very many, of the Vienna dynasty have intended their statements about meaning in this way. Most of them have publicly scorned this moral or practical sort of meaning. Many positivistic formulas, such as "a stattement means the method of its verification", do not admit of such an inter? pretation at all, while almost none of the interesting consequences which have been claimed for the verification-theory follows from this form of it, which, indeed, makes the charge "metaphysical" an entirely indefinite term of abuse. In so far as the verification *) It should hardly be necessary to remark, for instance, that I do not seriously suggest that the whole corporeality of physical objects is given as such in experience.</page><page sequence="5">The Realistic Interpretation of Scientific Sentences 379 theory has been so intended, of course, it avoids our criticisms, but it is hardly less unfortunate. Its terminology has been conducive to faction and misunderstanding; and even when it is clearly expressed, it cultivates the mistaken beliefs that there is some easy automatic criterion of scientific importance; that the importance of a statement is proportional to the extent to which it can be verified; that one can tell By looking at a sentence to what extent it can be verified; and worst of all, that science prospers best by the use of devices to limit it to the most superficial view and the narrowest range of possibilities. A similar comment must be made on the claim that the veri? fication theory is not a factual statement about what can be talked about, but a resolve not to talk about any but a certain class of things; or that it is a postulate definitive of the special languages of the scientists. Postulates and conventions can no more decide the reach of meaning than they can affect the range of a cannon, while to set arbitrary limits to what shall be meant is willfully to diminish our powers. The statement that only sentences which are more or less veri? fiable by experience have "empirical meaning" is comparatively innocuous, since it seems to mean merely that only such sentences are verifiable by experience. It is regrettable only because we already have a good word for verifiability, namely "verifiability", and confusion and conflict result from using "empirical meaning" as a synonym. The persons now most staunchly inclined to maintain the veri? fication theory of meaning in our sense of meaning, the important and ordinary sense, are the natural scientists. The milder version of the theory, namely, that a sentence means or designates some? thing only if it is at least indirectly or incompletely verifiable (confirmable), is comparatively harmless in practice, because in point of fact there are very few conceivable sentences to whose credibility no experience can be relevant. With the possible excep? tions of Parmenides and F. H. Bradley, all metaphysicians have believed, with more or less justice, that their doctrines "saved the appearances". On the other hand, the "weak" verification theory is equally false with the "strong", and is false in an egregiously bold and confusing way. It is logically impossible that a statement should</page><page sequence="6">38o Donald E. Williams mean what indirectly verifies it; in most cases, the evidence which indirectly verifies a statement will not be even similar to the type instances from which its connotation is derived, or to the objects which it denotes. But if the statement does not mean what verifies it, it surely means what causes what verifies it. But what causes what verifies it must surely exist prior to, and presumably inde? pendent of, what verifies it, and it will be, or can be, signified prior to and independently of the signification of the latter. The "weak" view, furthermore, has been ordinarily coupled with a misleading tendency to underestimate the number and kinds of sentences which can be "weakly" verified. And finnally, it does yield results different from those of the realistic analysis in the one dubious field of sub-atomic metrics, where not even indirect evidence is at present available or even conceivable. In this con? nection it has already led to such revolutionary results as the repudiation of causality, the defense of the freedom of the will, and the hypostatization of probability as a substantival ingredient of natural process; and it has provided English and American scientists with proofs of the existence of God and the superiority of the capitalistic system. Our scientists, moreover, are all too ready to slip over from the milder fallacy that a meaningful statement must be at least indi? rectly verifiable, to the more flagrant conclusion that what the statement means is the evidence which verifies it. It is a common? place that a scientific hypothesis (that the universe is expanding, for instance) is simply a compendious way of describing the observational data which support it (pictures of the spectral red shift, for instance). This is a return to an extreme variety of the "strong" verification theory, and, indeed, as some of the scientists are keen enough to admit, it leads to solipsism and the view that other persons' experience, including the experiences of all the positivistic scientists, really exist, or really can be referred to, only as figments of my experience. It is easier to find psychological and social causes for this de? bacle than logical reasons. The temper of our time is anthropo centric, phenomenalistie, skeptical. The general "failure of nerve"' has especially afflicted the physical scientist because with modern methods of research the line of communication and supply between his hypotheses and his evidence has become alarmingly attenuated.</page><page sequence="7">The Realistic Interpretation of Scientific Sentences 381 Finally, a more specific motive has been provided by the quandary of recent quantum-theory and wave-mechanics. For whereas there are at hand apparently satisfactory mathematical descriptions or schematizations of the empirical data, there has been found no way to formulate a consistent and intelligible account of the "real" intra-atomic processes which, on the realistic hypothesis, causally condition the data. The physicist cuts the Gordian knot by saying successively that there is no "real" atom, that it is nonsense to ask after a "real" atom, and that "the atom" or "the electron" really stand only for terms in the mathematical description of the labo? ratory observations. Now, modern physics is a very impressive phenomenon, but it is entitled to no special epistemological credit. The physicist is perfectly entitled to refuse to talk about anything except the evidence, or to assert that he has failed to discover the nature of the real atom; but he cannot properly make a virtue of the refusal or the failure. When he declares that there is no real atom, he makes a statement of the purest metaphysics for which he possesses little special competence, while when he says that it is in principle meaningless to ask about or speak of the real atom, he is voicing an epistemological speculation for which he has no special compe? tence at all, and which is as a matter of fact false. Strangely enough, the logical predicament of contemporary wave mechanics is essentially the same as that of the vitalistic theory of entelechy which has been so ridiculed by our scientific philosophers. In both cases, we know pretty exactly what is explained by the hypothesis ? patterns of precipitated silver, say, in the one case, phenomena of cellndivision, for instance, in the other; but in neither case do we know what is doing the explaining: that is, in neither phenomena, that is, the atomic organization, or the entelechy, as it is in itself. The vitalists have seemed in a weaker position only because they have lacked the hardihood to assert that the entelechy is the evidence for k. There is a close parallel between the physicist's resort to pheno? menalism to avoid the wave-particle antinomy, the philosophical positivist's resort to it to achieve an apparent unification of sciences by circumventing the mind^body problem, and the "Christian Scientist's resort to it to avoid the moral dilemma. In either case,</page><page sequence="8">382 Arne Ness even if phenomenalism were theoretically defensible, we can expect nemesis to overtake such subterfuges. The phenomenalistic reduction is successful just so far as it is isomorphic with a realistic descrip? tion, and difficulties in the latter must crop up again as surds in the former. The practicing scientist is likely to be unduly impressed with the possibility that microphysical entities have a character irredu? cible to any combination of properties of macroscopic instances. This suggestion is almost fabulously improbable, and may be logically absurd. The resources of positive phenomenal types and their derivatives are incalculably great, while at the worst, uni? queness itself, or the character of causing certain effects, are pheno? menal types. In any case finally, a possible extreme diversity in this instance could be no argument for a generally subjectivistic analysis of meaning. To sum up: whether a realistic physics is in principle possible is not a question for physics but for logic and epistemology, and these disciplines answer in the affirmative. I think that the present statements of physics are easily given a realistic interpretation, and are in fact so interpreted by the physicist except in his few spasms of philosophical doubt. A thoroughly solipsistic transcription of physics is probably too complex a task for any human mind. But if the physicists do insist upon describing only their sensations, we can always seek further for more resourceful and perspicacious investigators who will describe the rest of the world.</page></plain_text>
