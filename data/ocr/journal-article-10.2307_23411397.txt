<plain_text><page sequence="1">Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, New Caledonia: The Melanesian Delegations at the Eighth Festival of Pacific Arts Noumea, New Caledonia Caroline Yacoe Honolulu "For us these dances and rituals that you are about to see are not entertainment but a basic part of our culture." With those words a represen tative of Papua New Guinea's East New Britain Delegation, introduced an initiation ceremony presided over by their sacred tumbuan mask. With this ceremony and other Melanesian presentations audiences at the Eighth Festival or Pacific Arts were privileged to see rituals and dances that expressed the essence of traditional Melanesian cultures as they continue to be practiced today.

But when the Melanesians came on, a different atmosphere pre vailed. Papua New Guinea - West New Britain Perhaps the most unusual Melanesian presen tation was this initiation ceremony for two men and one woman into the Tumbuan Society of West New Britain, Papua New Guinea (Fig. I).1 The Tumbuan mask with a tapa cloth face incor porating images of eyes, a nose and mouth sym bohzes this very important organization. 1 he body of the masked dancer is adorned with special leaves and bush material. The wearer's identity is well hidden, for his power is considerable. In the "time before" a Tumbuan had the power of life or death over those who transgressed rules of the social structure. Even today, these masks have the authority to enforce the society's rules and to pun ish those who break them. Tumbuan societies remain an essential element in the traditional lire of many New Britain cultures. The masks repre senting their power vary in style, but their mean ing and symbolism remains fixed. With spears at the ready, brightly decorated men precede the sacred Tumbuan mask (Fig. 2). For those in the audience who know how tambu this mask is-especially to women who must stay at a distance of at least 25 feet, it is unnerving to be so close to it.2 As the ceremonies proceeded how ever, the participants and the initiates indicated through body language both their respect and awe of the Tumbuan mask (Fig. 3).

A play and the performance of a tatanua masked dancer, who normally would appear at funerary rituals, gave further evidence of the vitality of this cultur al tradition and its art works (Fig.5). Malangan rituals and their accompanying arts continue to be essential in marking different stages of life, social status .validating land use transactions, establish ing new sub clans, making rain and for celebra tions in this area of New Ireland. Papua New Guinea participants have always been a favorite of festivalgoers and this year's groups continued the tradition. In a more enter taining than serious vein, 16 men from Katanga, Madang province (who had won a national com petition to come to the Festival) delighted audi ences (Fig. 6). With bird of paradise feathers fly ing to the beat of kudo drums, faces and bodies highlighted with paint and bedecked with flowers, seed and shell ornamentation, the pride and enjoyment of these dancers was contagious. Vanuatu - Tommen and Banks Islands In 1988 an Arts Festival was held on tiny Tommen island off the southwest coast of Malekula which this writer had the privilege of attending. Although I was unaware of it at that time, their traditional practices, kastom, were under attack by local missionaries. Tommen Island is believed by many to be the place of ori Figure 3.

Among the most important are the grade taking rit uals which signify one's rank in the namingai socie ty central to Vanuatu social structure. This 1988 fes tival on Tommen Island was a turning point in the validation and continuation of Ni-Vanuatu culture and its accompanying art forms which were at risk of dying out under evangelical pressure.3 Now 12 years later, at this Eighth Festival of Pacific Arts, Chief Long Leil, one of the leaders of the earlier Tommen Island festival led this delegation. Ni Vanuatu men proudly circled the Festival grounds wearing their traditional woven red and natural col ored namba and grade -taking hats molded from bush material with natural dyes and images appro priate to their rank and clan (Fig. 7). Young men accompanied them by beating on the traditional ancestor -faced upright drums brought from the ceremonial grounds of Tommen Island. This per formance demonstrated that for both young and old, kastom remains strong (Fig. 8). In the Vanuatu house on the Festival grounds, a high-ranking woman's (masa) hat with its hang ing tails and many protuberances testified to the viability of the women's group that paralleled the men's namingai society. Also present were stone and wood anthropomorphic figures each depict ing a person's rank in the complicated structure of Figure 5.

These figures were further evidence that the complex arts and culture of Vanuatu remain intact in spite of missionary pressure. The extraordinary tamate headdresses of the Banks Islanders, another extremely remote area of Vanuatu, gave audiences some idea of the amazing diversity of the continuing art forms still in tradi tional use today. Creatures of the sea are a primary motif in these elegantly constructed headdresses (Fig. 9). They honor the different clans and totems that continue to play an important role in daily and ceremonial life. According to ethnomu sicologist Dr Raymond Ammann, knowledge relating to art forms in the Banks Islands is so important that it is kept secret except to a special few. In a lecture at Honolulu's East-West Center he described witnessing one dance where the words were not even sung but only whispered to the beat of a drum by the man honored with their knowledge.* On a more contemporary note, and in keeping with the Festival's theme of "Words of Yesterday, Words of Today and Words of Tomorrow", the paintings of Vanuatu artist, Moses Jobolovo, hung on the lanai at the Secretariat of the South Pacific Pacific Arts 77</page><page sequence="4">Figure 6.

New Caledonia - Kanak Dancers, Isle of Pines, Lifou and Grande Terre Of all the 23 delegations attending this Eighth Festival of Pacific Arts, none appeared to enjoy themselves more than the Kanaks from New Caledonia, the host country. Originally scheduled as the venue for the Fourth Festival in 1984, an uprising connected with the Kanak Independence Movement forced cancellation of the Festival. Under the leadership of Jean-Marie Tjibaou the Kanak Independence Movement secured agree ments with rrance in the Matignon Accords or 1988. In 1998 the Nouméa Accord constituted France's commitments to respect and preserve both French and Kanak culture and tradition. The performances and pride of the Kanak groups tak ing part in this Festival indicated at least a partial achievement of these goals. With the stomp of Figure 13. Male dancer with the Wetr group from Lifou, New Caledonia. &gt;. _o o o _c CU bamboo poles and the beat of leaf parcel drums, the hauntingly gentle, la, la, la, la, la, melody of Kanak dancers often exploded into wild shouts and energetic dance steps. With feathers in their hair, shells and beads across broad chests and mus cular arms and legs, palm-stripping dangling from outstretched arms, traditional Kanak dancers wel comed the voyaging canoes as they arrived at the beach of Anse Vata (Fig. 11). Some dancers bore "Pacifica 2000" painted in white clay on their backs — a proud reference to the 1975 Melanesian festival organized by Jean Marie Tjibaou. Participants ranged in age from around 5 to well into their 70s. Their enjoyment and exuberance carried over from scheduled performances at the Festival village to the streets and especially the Boules playing grounds adjoining the beach walk and harbor. To this writer it appeared that the public acknowledgement and appreciation of their dances (and therefore indirectly their culture) was part of the reason for these continuing perform ances. The obvious enjoyment of the participants, especially the Olobat troop from Isle of Pines who often were joined by spectators (even one man in 80 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="7">Figure 14.

Pilau, as these dances are called, were once part of larger exchange ceremonies known as pilau pilau that marked the end of mourning periods and other important events. Now they occur in smaller versions, to celebrate weddings and special occasions — even to entertain tourists. Immediately identifiable by their half black and white faces, the Wetr group from Lifou Island gave dramatic significance to the Festival theme of maintaining traditions but also embracing the present (Fig. 13). Their dances took the form of dynamic theatrical performances incorporating both traditional and contemporary music and movements (Fig. 14). The Tjibaou Cultural Center, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, symbolizes the recognition and existence of the Kanak people. Set on the Tina peninsula this dramatic structure has a compelling presence both day and night. On its grounds stand several "Great Houses" complete with carved doorposts and conical thatched roofs with soaring finials (Fig. 15). During the Festival, Kanak people stayed in the houses, creating the leaf drums, stamping poles and adornments for their dances. As in many Pacific cultures the rights to Kanak dances are owned by individual clans and may only be performed by them. One excep tion is the "Round Dance" where all may join in the dancing and playing of the many leaf drums and stamping poles (Fig. 16). Inside the Tjibaou Center the Noumea 2000 Contemporary Art Biennale showed the scope and talent of Pacific artists. Melanesian artists from Fiji, New Caledonia, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu pardcipated with a wide example of works ranging from traditional bilum bags to abstract images and multi media constructions that match art works found in any major museum worldwide. At the Eighth Festival of Pacific Arts audiences were privileged to see glimpses of authentic cere monies and rituals that underlie Melanesian cul tures. These performances as well as a multitude of other art forms demonstrate both the diversity and continued vitality of Melanesian people as they maintain their traditions while integrating with the contemporary world.

There are many different ways to spell "Tumbuan" and "Malangan". I have chosen these spellings, as they are the most phonetic. 2. In 1993 I was permitted to attend part of an ini tiation ceremony for the Tumbuan Society on the Duke of York Islands, in New Britain Province, Papua New Guinea. During these events it was made very clear that I must keep a considerable distance from the Tumbuan Masks. The woman whose family participated in the ceremonies told me personally that she "would be killed" if she (or other women) came upon the mask in the bush or got too close to it even today. In 1994 we were again filming ceremonies involving Tumbuan Masks, this time among the Sulka people in the Wide Bay area of East New Britain. Here I was repeatedly and pointedly told that in "the time before" my actions as a film director would have been cause for death and even then there was talk of sending me back to the capi tal town of Rabaul. 3. As the only outsider present at this 1998 Tommen Island Festival, I did not at that time fully understand the significance and impor tance of the ceremonies and rituals. At the 8th Festival of Pacific Arts in Noumea I was fortu nate to meet Tim Curtis of UNESCO, who had worked for many years in Vanuatu. He explained to me how vital this Tommen Island Festival was in preserving Ni-Vanuatu kastom from missionary attempts to destroy it. 4.
