<plain_text><page sequence="1">The New Scholarship on Dewey edited by Jim Garrison, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, USA Reprinted from STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION 13:3/4 Since 1979, when Richard Rorty's Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature appeared, there has been a flood of new scholarship on the philosophy of John Dewey. Surpris ingly, little of this scholarship has thus far made its way into the field of education, where Dewey's philosophy has traditionally had a wide influence. Many of the authors of this collection are philosophers who have created some of the most original and influential work in this new scholarship. Four of them - Larry Hickman, Thomas M. Alexander, Raymond D. Boisnet, and J.E. Tiles Dewey - have written major books that have re ceived wide international acclaim. Among the philosophers of education some, like Phil Jackson, are among the best known names in the entire international field, and have kept pace with Deweyan scholarship for many years. Others are younger scholars who know the new scholarship well. Finally, two promi nent feminists contribute important new work on Dewey, expanding the domain of the new scholarship on Dewey. One of them, Susan Laird, has had her work cited in the new biography of John Dewey by Robert Westbrook. Contents and Contributors Introduction: Education and the New Scholarship on John Dewey; J.

The boundary shift between the 'natural' and the 'social' is becoming permanent: moves in either direction are subject to ideological rhetoric. Yet there is continual exchange across the line: metaphors are moving freely between biol ogy and the social sciences. As messengers of meaning they become agents of change, forever undermining any attempt at fixing similarities and differences. Biology as Society, Society as Biology: Metaphors offers a unique look at the function of metaphors in mediating be tween two disciplinary cultures which represent and mold our views about nature and society, and the boundary be tween them. For professionals and students of history, philosophy and sociology of science, biology, and literary science alike. Contents and Contributors Introduction: Is There a Bridge over Troubled Waters? S.

The focus is on the fun damental categories of philosophical grammar, on the analysis of intentionality, of belief and Moore's paradox, on certainty and doubt, on will, memory, sensations and emotions, as well as on the theory of aspects and private language and the relationship with relativism and psychologism. In the recent literature there are undoubtedly numerous qualified publications dedicated to the themes of philosophical psychology as they emerge from Wittgenstein's Nachla? and from his writings on this subject published in the last decade. This book, however, provides the essential points of reference of Wittgenstein's late treatment of psychological concepts in the context of the general features of his early philosophy of science and language and in the framework of the trends of his time. The book is of special interest to scholars and students, philoso phers, linguists, psychologists, sociologists, cognitive scientists, logicians, historians of contemporary philosophy and science.

These include: the theory of knowledge; the general methodological problems of science, such as the problems of scientific discovery and scientific inference, of induction and probability, of causation and of the role of mathematics, statistics and logic in science; the methodological and foundational problems of the different departmental sciences, in so far as they have philosophical interest; those aspects of symbolic logic and of the foundations of mathematics which are relevant to the philosophy and methodology of science; and those facets of the history and sociology of science which are important for contemporary topical pursuits. Special attention is paid to the role of mathemati cal, logical and linguistic methods in the general methodology of science and the foundations of the different sciences, be they physical, biological, behavioral or social. Papers are invited in all these fields. Efforts are underway presently to organize some of the issues into the form of symposia of papers dealing with described themes. Potential contributors are encouraged to consult the managing editor for the scope of the symposia and for their deadlines. In addition to special symposia, papers unconnected with these symposia will also be published regularly. The minutes and official announcements of the Division of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science, International Union of History and Philosophy of Science (DLMPS/IUHPS), will be published in SYNTHESE.
