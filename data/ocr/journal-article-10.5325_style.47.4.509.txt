<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Daniel Newman University of Toronto Flaubertian Aesthetics, Modernist Ethics and  Animal Representation in Hemingway’s  Green Hills of Africa In Flaubert’s “A Simple Heart,” old Félicité has her dead parrot Loulou stuffed and  mounted, then idolizes it as an incarnation of the Holy Ghost. The tale is narrated  in Flaubert’s typical detached, almost clinical style, but the final sentence brings  an unexpected turn. As Félicité dies, we see through her eyes “a gigantic parrot  soaring above her head” (Œuvres II.177; translations are mine). This potentially  melodramatic ending is surprisingly stirring and, because the narrator withholds  comment, hard to interpret. It might redeem Félicité’s mundane life—or mock  her superstition. Or perhaps conflating real animal and spiritual symbol signals a  failure to see things as they are. This is the reading I’ll pursue, for I am intrigued  by how much an animal qua animal plays into the ending’s ambiguities. In the  animal, Flaubert finds a way to foreground the ethical implications of his artistic  theories and practice.  Literary animals distinctively highlight the ethics of style because animals  uniquely challenge notions of sympathy, knowledge, and meaningful communication.  The responsibility they force upon us is especially acute in modernism, with its  epistemological skepticism and rejection of sympathetic identification. From the  snail in Woolf’s “Kew Gardens” to Cummings’ grasshopper, animals foreground  perspectival and representational problems that test literature’s stylistic limits.  Few modernists are as attentive to these issues as Ernest Hemingway. His love of  killing animals aside—for now—Hemingway strives ethically to match his style to  their peculiar otherness. In Green Hills of Africa, he especially depicts animals in  Flaubertian style: impersonally but accurately; they are recognized as real fellow‐ creatures rather than symbols or objects, yet respected as beings inaccessible to  human ways of knowing and relating. Green Hills is modernist indeed, repeatedly  shifting the narrative spotlight from the hunt to the animals beyond the hunter’s  drama. In brief but significant moments, it shifts from its primary genre, the trophy‐ hunting memoir, and becomes a naturalist’s tale. Style: Volume 47, No. 4 Winter 2013 509 </page> <page sequence="2"> 510 Daniel Newman This is not to deny Hemingway’s troubling relationship with animals. He  revels in meting out death, and though he insists on the “mutual respect” involved  in “real killing” (Death 127, 232), he scarcely questions his right to deploy such a  fatal brand of respect. Bullfighting may be “a tragedy” in which the bull dies the  hero’s necessary death (Death 6), but can we sanction the killer who casts himself  as Fate? When Francis Macomber literally feels for the lion he shoots, his sympathy  is less compassionate or responsive than colonizing; as Ruth Mayer notes, “the  contact imagined is strictly unidirectional, demarking an extreme form of takeover  or intake” (256). Hemingway’s treatment of animals merges with his paternalistic,  even hostile misogyny, orientalism and racism (as Cary Wolfe convincingly argues  in his excellent discussion of Hemingway in Animals Rites). Green Hills of Africa  is typically deemed the worst offender. Later works like True at First Light are  more sympathetic towards animals, revealing, according to Ryan Hediger, Kevin  Maier, and Carey Voeller, the dawning of a kinder outlook.  This assessment might apply to the real Hemingway who killed real animals  but learned to do it less wantonly. But the stakes are more complicated once the  killings are narrativized. Narrativization adds to animal ethics the problem of  representation and the various ironies that attend distinctions between author  (henceforth “Hemingway”), narrating‐I (“the narrator”) and narrated‐I (“Ernest”).  Indeed, it is because he narrates himself killing animals that Hemingway so ably  foregrounds the ethics of animal representation. His narratives alienate us, or appeal  to us in distasteful ways, but this alienation highlights rhetorical nuances that might  otherwise pass unnoticed. Recoiling from his hunting scenes, we are more disposed  to see style apart from content; and this separation, possible only conceptually, is  a good initial step towards understanding how content and style work together to  produce ethical responses. Narratives that elicit strong disapproval can help us see  and analyze the interdependence of style and ethics. An understandable reaction  to aestheticized violence is to deplore “the very act of representing some subjects  from some perspectives” (Phelan, Living 102). But any representation has a style  and, therefore, an aesthetic. In works featuring disgusting acts like Lolita and Time’s  Arrow, style is what reveals a dissenting moral stance. Green Hills lacks the ironic  structure of unreliability, yet its animal ethics are tied to Hemingway’s “rigorous  attention to style” and “aesthetic engagement” with animals (Hediger 37, 38).   The method of Green Hills, most evident in its animal descriptions, owes a lot  to “the discipline of Flaubert” (27), the “one that we believed in” (71)—especially  Flaubert’s obsession with finding the mot juste (the right word) and achieving  authorial impersonality. Consequently, though perhaps unwittingly, Hemingway  </page> <page sequence="3"> Flaubertian Aesthetics 511 represents animals without falling into “that unavoidable mysticism of a man who  writes a language so badly he cannot make a clear statement” (Death 53). Thomas  Honegger argues that “Hemingway’s aim to find the animal juste” yields “distinct  and real creatures” (181), but for Honegger, “the animal juste” is merely means  of describing humans (183–84). I argue instead that in Hemingway’s generally  anthropocentric narratives, applying the mot juste is an imperfect but nevertheless  ethical attempt to show juste l’animal—just the animal. Mixing careful observation  with defamiliarizing descriptions of animals, he makes it “difficult . . . to take them  as a matter of course” (Green 185). Representing animals requires a peculiar ethics applicable neither to humans  nor to non‐sentient life forms. The issue is vexed because animals differ from us in  ways that are undeniable yet hard to define. After Darwin, the difference can’t be  considered essential: excluding them, at least a priori, from ethical consideration  is therefore unreasonable. If an animal is, as Derrida claims, “an existence eluding  every concept” (26), its evident capacity for experience gives its life value, even if  its experiences are just barely conceivable to us.  Barbara Herrnstein Smith is right to insist, however, that accepting ethical  responsibility doesn’t preclude drawing ethical distinctions (166–67). This is  especially true when we turn from flesh‐and‐blood to represented animals. Ethical  representation demands firm distinctions between human and animal, simply  because animals maintain “the reticence of all consciousness that is beyond ours”  (Hearne 170). As Kate Soper observes, “claims of affinity between ourselves and  other animals . . . must acknowledge a limit at the level of representation itself.  Animals, after all, do not write stories about human beings, nor puzzle over their  reflection in literature” (308). Because at least some animals have thoughts, interests,  emotions and individuality, they merit, like people, not being misrepresented; yet  representation inevitably, unfairly anthropomorphizes them. “The only vocabulary  at our disposal is a vocabulary of strictly human concerns,” writes Aldous Huxley;  “the things we want to talk about are non‐human realities and non‐human ways of  thinking. Hence the radical inadequacy of all statements about our animal nature”  (129)—and, I would add, all statements about animals tout court. Even the most  excluded of human others can at least potentially dispute how they are portrayed;  writers, moreover, can imagine how their portraits will be received. Non‐human  animals “literally cannot talk back to our objectifying codes” (Rohman 17).  A way out is to accept our inability to comprehend animals. This accepted,  the ethical imperative becomes pragmatic: to minimize anthropomorphism. Ralph  Acampora advocates accepting “an element of zoöntic discovery—otherwise we  </page> <page sequence="4"> 512 Daniel Newman risk sliding into species‐solipsism” (75)—and considering other species partially  accessible to us, “neither purely objective nor purely subjective,” “yielding enough  awareness” to be represented as part of our shared experience (74). The ethic must  be rooted in empathy, the compassion we can feel “for creatures whose experience  we know we can never share” but whose “capacity for complex experience” can  be recognized (Nussbaum 330, 333).  To put such theories into practice, Kate Soper advocates “naturalistic” over  “allegorical” or “compassionate” modes of representation (303)—as do Gillian Beer  (311) and Margot Norris (6). Writing animals right would then demand techniques  that disproportionately engage the “mimetic” function in characterization, relative to  “thematic” and “synthetic” functions (Phelan, Reading 2–3). Mimesis can’t entirely  displace the other functions, but it should be prominent enough to eclipse or distract  from animals’ symbolic, allegorical, or structural roles. “To think, or represent, in  this mode,” argues Soper, “is to observe and respect the distance between ourselves  and other animals,” to minimize anthropocentrism by disabling “straightforward  analysis” (306). Of course signifiers never give us referents, but some ways of  using words help us to consider the real even as—indeed because—language fails.  Nowhere does it fail better than in striving for perfection. Though modernism is rarely associated with mimesis, Soper’s naturalistic  ideal is congenial with modernism’s attempt to expand the realist tradition beyond  human concerns—an aim memorably captured in Joyce’s rendering of a cat’s meow:  “Mrkgnao!” (53). Several modernists saw in animals the perfect subjects for making  it new, including Forster, who looked forward to novels with “animals who are  neither symbolic, nor little men disguised, nor as four‐legged tables moving, nor  as painted scraps of paper that fly” (51). Such animals are found, argues Etienne  Terblanche, in “(inter)active and open‐ended” modernist experiments (218) that  achieve what philosophic language, even Derrida’s, cannot (223ff): sustained ethical  engagements with animals. For many modernists, indeed, the limits of language  and the peculiar otherness of animals were kindred problems, to be addressed if  not resolved stylistically.  Rather unfairly, modernism is viewed skeptically by much ethical criticism,  which often views good style suspiciously. Norris, for example, bans Hemingway  from the biocentric tradition for aestheticizing animals (198). Yet ethics like  aesthetics are many, and some aesthetics better fit the varieties of otherness that we  encounter in a modern, pluralistic world. Modernism, proposes Melba Cuddy‐Keane,  is particularly suited to such ethical conditions (209). Derek Attridge similarly  insists that modernism is “in its effect if not always in its intention, allied to a new  </page> <page sequence="5"> Flaubertian Aesthetics 513 apprehension to the claims of otherness” (4); Attridge, discussing Coetzee, certainly  has animals in mind. In his own anti‐anthropocentric mission, Huxley writes of  replacing “traditional language” with “another special language, more precise and,  above all, less contaminated with self‐interest” (131). A clear allusion to Flaubert,  it is a rare moment when Huxley agrees, on matters of ethics and aesthetics with  his modernist peers, who admired Flaubert’s agonized search for exactitude, his  detachment and his contempt for philistinism.  For Flaubert, the mot juste is an ethical as well as aesthetic ideal, a tonic for the  “mots banals” of commerce, generalization and prejudice (Œuvres I.184). To honor  the most trivial object with precise terminology is to try meeting it as something real,  particular and worthy of effort; it is a refusal to misrepresent through carelessness  or cliché. There is, in Flaubert and his followers, a deep faith in the ethical value of  percipience. The mot juste is the right and fair term.. Likewise, Flaubert’s ideal of  impersonality lets objects speak rather than be spoken for (though we shouldn’t forget  that telling is involved in all showing). Reading “A Simple Heart,” we appreciate  Loulou not because we share Félicité’s delusions but because we see—without  facile symbolism, squeamishness or judgment—the parrot’s body and behavior in  intimate detail. Little touches like its grotesque pose in death—“head down, nails  in the steel bars” (Œuvres II.175)—are not honorific in any conventional sense, but  the objective presentation, insofar as objectivity is possible, offers a collective rather  than authoritative valuation Loulou, for its invites our participation. Impersonality  and precision grant us freedom from the narrator’s or author’s moral coercion. But  freedom has its costs: sharing in the ethical meaning means sharing responsibility  for the ethic (Hale 200).  Flaubertian aesthetics are thus congenial with recent work in narrative  ethics, which, drawing on rhetorical criticism and poststructuralism, focuses on  how narratives open readers to the claims of the Other, stressing connection and  recognition without requiring identification or sympathy. In this readerly activity,  which Dorothy Hale calls self‐binding, readers are made to “limit the self and,  through this limitation, produce the Other” (190). Self‐binding unsettles or at least  exposes anthropocentricism, facilitating contact with alien ways of being without  presuming to explain them. It is a compelling paradigm for the ethics of animal  representation because it specifies that the status of alterity is “self‐consciously  unverifiable” (190). Offering a similar ethical project, Michael Fox and Lesley  McLean assert that our “affective perception in relation to other animals” must  not overcome a respect for “their distinctive experience” as individual creatures  experiencing particular moments (159).  </page> <page sequence="6"> 514 Daniel Newman By encouraging simultaneous recognition and unknowability, Hale’s and similar  models recall defamiliarization, whose function is both to enliven art by renewing  perceptions and to elicit political engagement. Flaubertian techniques seem almost  designed for achieving such complex rhetorical and ethical effects. The mot juste  and impersonality pull readers in opposite directions. Through its very aptness, the  mot juste invites recognition and connection; because it aims for mimetic capture, it  is also potentially predatory or colonizing. But impersonality forestalls connection  and shrugs off—or seems to shrug off—responsibility for the mot juste’s justness.  Readers must decide how it should be interpreted, and whether it is really so juste.  Of Hemingway’s animal writings, none presents such interpretive and ethical  challenges as Green Hills of Africa. This memoir has, unsurprisingly, angered or  worried critics concerned by how its animals are treated (Love 122–23; Maier  119–22; Mayer 252–59). Even critics who can imagine a positive ethic in hunting  narratives deplore Green Hills; for Hediger, its ethics are nothing but “rules that  permit the game of competition among humans” (41–42). I would argue, however,  that such responses are too focused on judging Hemingway or his persona. Though  judgment is one way to interact ethically with narratives, and eliciting it always  among the (implied) author’s functions, surely ethics admits of degrees and asks  questions that elude the definiteness of judgment. Highlighting ethical puzzlers  rather than ethical solutions, a characteristic of modernism, may ultimately be what  makes a narrative “ethically admirable” (Phelan, Living 97). For J. Hillis Miller,  modernism makes us responsible “for judgment when the grounds for judgment  are not entirely certain” (qtd. in Hale 193). I’d go further, envisioning, like Hale,  an ethic that doesn’t end with judgment but “transforms the activity of ethical  judgment into the production of alterity as beyond apprehension, as defined by its  illimitable potentiality” (195). Nabokov asks us to judge Humbert, but he more  importantly forces us to examine how and whom we judge.  Controversial narratives make not simply judging difficult, demanding special  attention to the rhetorical fine points that differentiate a simplistic moral from a  complex ethic— semantic polyvalence, focalization, register, syntax, irony, tense,  aspect, and mood. While ethical criticism must consider how Hemingway’s animals  are treated in the narrative, it must also assess how this treatment itself is treated  by the narrative. Though we may object to Hemingway’s hunting scenes, our  objections would probably be stronger if the animals were described carelessly.  Unless we believe the only ethical solution is not to write about trophy hunting  at all or to condemn it unequivocally (legitimate beliefs that don’t get us far with  Hemingway), we might acknowledge the ethical contribution of style in coexistence  </page> <page sequence="7"> Flaubertian Aesthetics 515 with offensive content. Besides, as Fox and McLean rightly observe, the “unease”  we feel when reading about violence done to animals is a form of the “affective  perception” (165) involved in ethical engagement. Though Green Hills calls shooting birds a “marvellous joke” (36), there is  something strikingly caring in the narrator’s attentiveness to how the birds “turned  over in the air” (37) and “thumped hard as they fell and as they lay, wings beating”  (36). A contrast should clarify the value I see in this kind of description. In Hurston’s  Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), Janie also kills birds for a lark: “she could  shoot a hawk out of a pine tree and not tear him up. Shoot his head off” (131).  Though Their Eyes offers an overwhelmingly more complex ethical experience  than Green Hills, Hurston does what Hemingway rarely does: reduce an animal to  a blank signifier. Her hawk could as easily be a turkey, whereas Hemingway shows  very particular guinea fowl that “rocketed up, their legs tucked close beneath them,  heavy‐bodied, short wings drumming, cackling” (36) and “dark ibises, looking,  with their dipped bills, like great curlews” (129). Hurston’s narrator celebrates  Janie’s marksmanship, or sympathetically channels Janie’s excitement through free  indirect discourse. In Green Hills, by contrast, shooting birds is “a joke” mitigated  by the perspective of the guide M’Cola, whose laughter reduces Ernest into “the  clown of the piece” (37).   Hemingway’s birds exemplify the distinction between the narrated slaughter  and narrational presentation of animals, a distinction emerging, as I proposed earlier,  from the predominance of the mimetic function. Readers might be appalled when,  in “Big Two‐Hearted River,” Nick impales a grasshopper on a fishhook; but the  description of “the grasshopper t[aking] hold of the hook with his front feet, spitting  tobacco juice on it” (In Our Time 148) complicates the ethics of the action narrated  by so precisely rendering grasshopper behavior. Granted a moment to perform  its futile defensive action, naturalistically and without comment, the grasshopper  exceeds its instrumentality, creating a specific ethical bond with readers who,  briefly distracted from Nick’s quest, encounter the animal. Scholes and Kellogg  note that “the most mimetic characterizations seem . . . to exist largely outside  the area of meaning” (Scholes and Kellogg 103), suggesting one way in which  narratives produce “the Other as excess” (Hale 195). Thus Hemingway honors the  grasshopper with enough unmotivated mimesis to shift the focus from Nick and  his fishing to the charcoal‐blackened insect. The grasshopper anticipates the animals of Green Hills of Africa, which is, like  “Big Two‐Hearted River,” primarily a human story, its animals mostly serving to  catalyze human relations. By hunting, Ernest communes with his African guides— </page> <page sequence="8"> 516 Daniel Newman though, significantly, only when the hunt is successful. He also uses tracking and  killing to mediate his more complex relationships (aggressive, competitive, erotic)  with his wife P.O.M., Pop, and Karl. Karl and Ernest’s rivalry especially eclipses  the animals. When Ernest kills a rhino, it is real, strange, physical, particular: long‐hulked, heavy‐sided, prehistoric looking, the hide like vulcanized rubber and faintly  transparent looking, scarred with a badly healed horn wound that the birds had pecked at,  his tail thick, round, and pointed, flat many‐legged ticks crawling on him, his ears fringed  with hair, tiny pig eyes, moss growing on the base of his horn that grew out forward from  his nose.  (79)  Individualized by the moss and wound, the rhinoceros is nothing more or less than  itself (but see Philip Armstrong’s negative reading of the same passage [152]). But  when Karl kills a bigger one, all individuality disappears: it’s just “a rhino that was  a rhino” (83). Ernest’s rhino is reduced to “a lousy runt” (84), his disappointment  that of shamed manhood: “Why couldn’t he [Karl] just get a good one, two or  three inches longer? Why did he have to get one that makes mine ridiculous?” (85).  Competing with Karl is Ernest’s primary spur; when Ernest loses, the animals hardly  matter. They are similarly overshadowed by the rivalry between Ernest and Pop (or  J. P.) for P.O.M.’s attentions. Indeed, it is this erotic contest and homosocial bond,  not the hunt, that motivates the book’s existence: Green Hills is Ernest’s gift to  P.O.M., who, after the safari, complains that she “can’t remember Mr. J. P.’s face”  (295). With Pop away, Ernest can indulge her desire “to please Mr. J. P.” (95), so  he promises to “write you a piece some time and put him in” (295). All the animal  stories are thus subsumed to his vexed friendship with Pop—P.O.M.’s “ideal of  how a man should be” (64). Again, the rivalry features a rhinoceros. Pop, who hates  “ornamental killing” (16), nevertheless “offer[s] up the rhino to please” Ernest:  “‘Shoot the bastard,’ Pop said, making a gift of him” (17). This act of gift‐giving  generates an erotic triangle involving Pop, P.O.M. and Ernest, and though Ernest  feels usurped, the rhino is the one excluded. Animals are often also pawns in Ernest’s personal struggles, their deaths  allowing him to hone his art or justify his life, as Wolfe also argues of The Sun also  Rises (124–42). The hunt and its representation are therefore inextricable. “A great  killer must love to kill,” Hemingway writes in Death in the Afternoon, in a notorious  passage: “Killing cleanly and in a way which gives you aesthetic pleasure and pride  has always been one of the greatest enjoyments of a part of the human race. One of  its greatest pleasures . . . is the feeling of rebellion against death which comes from  its administering” (232–33). Hemingway’s language is methodically Flaubertian,  covering Flaubert’s elitism (“part of the human race”) and faith in artistic immortality  </page> <page sequence="9"> Flaubertian Aesthetics 517 (“rebellion against death”), as well as on his perfectionism (“the best thing”) and  detachment (“abnegation”) (ibid. 232). Impersonality and precision are literary  requisites as well as practical tools for matadors or, on safari, marksmen: “going  into that impersonal state you shoot from” is how you avoid “a very complicated  personal feeling” about your prey (Green 76, 137). Detachment is also necessary  for true aim, as Pop reminds Ernest before the kudu hunt (230). “The writer,” like  the hunter, is “intelligent and disinterested” (2); the great killer is “a great stylist”  (48). Hemingway’s animal representations are therefore problematically linked  with his real‐life violence against them.  Most disturbing is the narrator’s special pleading based on knowing “how a  bull elk must feel if you break a shoulder and he gets away” (148). Having been  shot, he sympathizes with animals he has injured and imagines his pain is “a  punishment for all hunters.” His sympathy spurs his resolve to hunt only “as long  as I could kill cleanly,” but his rationale seems less compassionate than vengeful:  “if it was a punishment I had paid it and at least I knew what I was doing. I did  nothing that had not been done to me” (148). Also dubious, his decision to hunt  instead of “enlist[ing]” in further political conflicts is motivated by the need to be  “responsible only for [him]self” (148)—an understandable desire, but one that  neglects the unwilling animal participants. Hunting alone, he feels “something I  cannot yet define completely but the feeling comes when you write well and truly  and know impersonally you have written in that way” (148–49). Killing satisfies a  Flaubertian ambition to “write well,” while the emphasis on “feeling” prioritizes  self, ambition and aesthetics over ethical engagement. Yet there is a valuable ethic in it. Ernest aims to do justice to “the country”  (194) by writing something with more than “journalistic value” (193), for in his  view “the damned Safari books” he knows are sensational, inaccurate, and self‐ aggrandizing: “They all have this damned Nairobi fast life or else bloody rot about  shooting beasts with horns half an inch longer than some one else shot” (193–94)—a  statement that ironizes Ernest’s earlier sore losing to Karl.  Green Hills shows not only Ernest’s heroics and “Garrick performance”  (269) but also “the country and the animals” (194). Counter intuitively, it critiques  hunting through style just as Hemingway’s later novel The Garden of Eden critiques  hunting, according to Wolfe, through the deconstruction of gender, race and species  differences. In this novel, Wolfe argues, the protagonist David’s participation in the  competitive, imperialist and “sacrificial enterprise that excludes women, animals,  and children” (166) is subverted by his “cross‐species identification” (165), which  “expos[es] the sacrificial economy of speciesism—the unquestioned availability  </page> <page sequence="10"> 518 Daniel Newman of ‘animality’ as a means of naturalizing and grounding racist discourse” (167).  Green Hills also undermines “the sacrificial economy of speciesism” but does so  mainly stylistically, by punctuating and puncturing the hunting narrative with oddly  arresting animal descriptions. Yes, Green Hills favors people: globally, at the level of plot, human dramas  overshadow the vividness, reality, and strangeness of the animals, but it also  repeatedly weaves in what Linda Vance calls “lesser narratives, stories that operate  within, and are influenced by, these larger spheres” (168). Portraying himself as  a hunter truly interested in his prey, the narrator fuses his rugged hunter with the  gentler persona of the naturalist. Watching the Sea of Galilee, the narrator reports  seeing “many grebes, . . . and I was counting them and wondering why they never  were mentioned in the Bible. I decided that those people were not naturalists”  (294, my emphasis). Through its “lesser narratives,” Green Hills offers itself as  a naturalist’s tale, the “reverse of the Bible” (191)—that quintessentially human  story, which gave man dominion over beast and bird Had Hemingway aimed for mere sympathy with animals, he might have  shown us their thoughts, though this would weaken Green Hills’ claim to be  “an absolutely true book” (“Foreword” n.p.). Alternatively, he might have given  objective, field‐guide accounts of color, shape, size, habits. But he avoids both  extremes. With Flaubert’s “discipline” (27) for detail and accuracy, Hemingway  mimetically foregrounds animal reality and corporeality; the sable is thus “a large,  deep chestnut‐brown animal, almost black, the horns black and curving handsomely  back, there was a white patch on the muzzle and back from the eye, there was a  white belly” (261). Such repetitive detail is, despite Hemingway’s commitment to  verbal economy, anything but overdone, for it lets us see the animals, their shape,  coloring, behavior. The description of the sable is typical: it is detailed nearly to  the point of narrative failure, syntax and narrativity straining under the weight of  adjectives and nouns.  What we don’t see is the animals’ mind; at most we can infer, tentatively,  emotions or thoughts from their movements, as when kudus, “big, grey, striped‐ flanked antelope with ridiculously small heads, big ears,” travel in “a soft, fast‐rushing  gait that moved them in big‐bellied panic through the trees” (138). If Hemingway  tries to cast animals as complex characters, he holds back from trying to reveal  their unknowable interiority. Nor do we sense that the narrator knows more than  we. Rather than turn toward the subjective, Hemingway’s aloofness cuts both  ways: denied access to animal minds, we are also spared their anthropomorphized  reduction into products of Ernest’s mind. Showing only exteriors, the descriptions  </page> <page sequence="11"> Flaubertian Aesthetics 519 prevent us from identifying exactly who is focalizing or whose prejudices dominate  (Ernest’s? the narrator’s? ours?). The narrator’s detachment may suggest emotional  indifference to animals, but its rhetorical effect is quite the opposite: it whets the  reader’s desire to make the connections the narrator withholds. To this end, it is  with ethical urgency that Hemingway seeks the mot juste.  The narrator’s very striving for exactitude is alienating because it paradoxically  undermines mimesis, but also because its results are, by traditional literary standards,  jarringly ineloquent, overwritten, rambling, or stilted. A kudu is “big, long‐legged,  a smooth gray with the white stripes and the great, curling, sweeping horns, brown  as walnut meats, and ivory pointed, at the big ears and the great, lovely heavy‐ maned neck the white chevron between his eyes and the white of his muzzle” (231);  another, even stranger, is “no more like a real bull than a spike elk is like a big, old,  thick‐necked, dark‐maned, wonder‐horned, tawny‐hided, beer‐horse‐built bugler  of a bull‐elk” (138). Such descriptions are too rare, complains Ernest, who “cannot  read other naturalists unless they are being extremely accurate and not literary” (21).  Precision ennobles: we see how animals move and look, an imagistic rightness  approaching the clarity of epiphany. But where epiphany might be reductive or  totalizing, Hemingway’s images are too fragmented to cohere: compounds confuse  syntax and the rhythms of fine writing; vehicles are more unfamiliar than their  tenors; animals, which Adam colonized through naming, are polyonymous. An  animal is thus more than its name, symbolic association, popular image, or even  taxonomic status.  There is justice in using the word that “sound[s] exactly” as the thing itself  suggests it “should sound” (Green 52), Hemingway suggests, but his take on this  ethical imperative results in mots justes that are more alienating than illuminating.  This is especially true when English fails to supply them. “I must learn to use these  terms correctly,” says the “Old Lady” of the Spanish lexicon of bullfighting (Death  95). Good hunters, like good writers, supplement their native tongue’s deficiencies.  Ernest’s rival Karl is therefore censured for “hunting an animal whose Swahili  name he could not then remember,” a failing linked with his getting “excited and  miss[ing]” shots (62). Knowing native names underlies Ernest’s desire to write  an honest safari book (193); a vital step in his growth as both writer and hunter is  hearing Swahili as “natural, no longer to be italicized” (52).  At its simplest, he estranges by giving animals two names. As both “waterbuck”  and “kongoni” (52), the antelope is more present than with either English or Swahili  term alone, as if the words interacted synergistically. The resulting defamiliarization  also makes it harder to forget the real animal—a strange, live “simba” rather  </page> <page sequence="12"> 520 Daniel Newman than a lion (42), which by that name is so embedded in our cultural and religious  imagination it might seem merely emblematic. Using “simba,” Hemingway partially  liberates the lion from Western iconography, as if reviving it for a new naturalistic  tradition. Mirroring “lion, lion, rhino, buffalo, kudu, kudu” with “Simba, Simba,  Faro, Nyati, Tendalla, Tendalla” (241), he also unmoors the animals from the  potentially co‐optative narrative of scientific description: the doubling undoes the  reductive Linnaean fiction of one species, one name. The use of Swahili also highlights how verbal precision and authorial  impersonality interact to produce the text’s peculiar animal ethic. Without authorial  guidance, Swahili words are disorienting. They provide the crispness of the right  word but the resulting image remains dissonantly unfinished and the portrait of  the animal rather strange. Now, as Randy Malamud notes of Marianne Moore’s  poetry, this simultaneous “appeal to/detachment from” animals is not predicated  on close contact (126); Moore’s exactitude, he argues, is more commendable for  being mediated through other writers’ descriptions. By hunting, the flesh‐and‐ blood Hemingway would thus compromise the ethical value of his representations  (ibid. 125). Malamud’s claim is persuasive, but I wonder how sustainably we can  meaningfully engage with recycled textual animals. In any case, Hemingway  like Moore produces animal portraits whose alienating strangeness is ethically  provocative.  Nowhere is this clearer than in Hemingway’s accurate but odd taxonomic  similes linking two very different species. The African “ibises, looking . . . like great  curlews” (129) are both more vivid and stranger for resembling an Arctic shorebird.  A kudu smells “sweeter than an eland” (234), a ranking unlikely to enlighten most  readers, but enriching the sensory moment through strange kinship—especially  when the olfactory image is enriched with bovine and botanical accents: “the breath  of cattle and the odor of thyme after rain” (231). The “generuk, that long‐necked  antelope that resembles a praying mantis in its way of carrying itself” (160), is  part herbivore ungulate, part predatory insect. As with spoonerisms, the “parts  remain distinguishable, and yet there is a constant small excitement in their being  yoked together so deftly and so improperly. An equivalence is at once asserted and  questioned” (Ellmann 90). No less nuanced and slippery are Hemingway’s ambiguous focalization and  mutative style. Though popularly equated with objectivity and a paratactic, repetitive  and declarative style, his range is extraordinary. In Green Hills, his typical hardboiled  style is punctuated with remarkable bouts of lyricism, free indirect discourse and  even labyrinthine interior monologue (281–83). If some reflect Ernest’s shifting  </page> <page sequence="13"> Flaubertian Aesthetics 521 moods (boredom, impatience, disorientation, excitement), others reveal something  of his prey. From the welter of styles emerges an animal “in its alien and natural  otherness” (Soper 306), and none more so than the hyena, whose death is initially  narrated in a disturbingly incongruous style:  Highly humorous was the hyena obscenely loping, full belly dragging, at daylight in the  plain, who, shot from the stern, skittered on into speed to tumble end over end. Mirth  provoking was the hyena that stopped out of range by an alkali lake to look back and, hit  in the chest, went over on his back, his four feet and his full belly in the air. . . . But the  great joke of all . . . , the pinnacle of hyenic humor, was the hyena, the classic hyena, that  hit too far back while running, would circle madly, snapping and tearing at himself until  he pulled his own intestines out, and then stood there, jerking them out and eating them  with relish.  (37–38) Presented in a burlesque tone, with archaic and mock‐lyrical syntactical inversions  (and perhaps an allusion to Joyce’s Bloom, who eats offal “with relish” [53]), these  killings (note the iterative “would”) are unsettling because the narrator drops his  usual detached and often ironic attitude towards Ernest and apparently endorses  the killings: “nothing,” he reports, “could be more jolly” (37). Grotesquely, this  perspectival rapprochement invites readers to laugh along.  Then something remarkable happens. M’Cola utters the hyena’s Swahili name,  “Fisi,” triggering a shocking change in style:  Fisi, the hyena, hermaphroditic, self‐eating devourer of the dead, trailer of calving cows,  ham‐stringer, potential biter‐off of your face at night while you slept, sad yowler, camp‐ follower, stinking, foul, with jaws that crack the bones the lion leaves, belly dragging,  loping away on the brown plain, looking back, mongrel dog‐smart in the face.  (38)  Shifting into a corporeal, rhythmically‐stilted and biologically‐acute homage to an  unsightly but suffering being, the passage condenses the elements of Hemingway’s  animal ethic: bilingual nomenclature; interspecies comparison (“mongrel dog”);  and accurate description (“hermaphroditic” because females boast a pseudopenis).  Thus described, Fisi is no longer subsumed to Ernest’s perspective, as though the  narrator now feels compelled to stop the narrative bullying. Ernest’s careless mirth  is replaced by facts, graceless pseudo‐Homeric epithets and syntactic lapses, none  attributable to any focalizer. Reading this passage, Mary Allen prefers Hemingway’s  seriousness to M’Cola’s laughter (182), but it is M’Cola who turns the “dirty joke”  (38) into a more complex ethical response: “delighted sorrow” (38).  Anyone reading Green Hills of Africa for an animal‐friendly ethic will be  disappointed. Yet, for all the horrors it describes, the description itself has ethical  value we shouldn’t overlook. If style doesn’t redeem shocking content, it certainly  complicates our ethical response and, perhaps, encourages more attentive reading  </page> <page sequence="14"> 522 Daniel Newman and consideration of animals. Thus “oryx” might indicate not just some generalized  victim with a “worthless” hide (158), but an animal as singular and vivid as “a fat,  plum‐colored, Masai donkey with marvellous long, black, straight, back‐slanting  horns” (156). Simultaneously recognizable and defamiliarizing, the oryx and many  other animals in Green Hills of Africa reflect Hemingway’s modernist technical and  ethical appropriation of Flaubertian principles. And though I began by claiming  unique ethical status for literary animals, the peculiarities of animal narrative ethics  may yet teach us about fairly representing anything—or anyone, from intimates to  the neighbors we don’t know or inhabitants of other lands or eras. Asking how best  to write animals thus allows us to ask a more general question close to the heart of  Hemingway and other modernists: how to write.
