SECOND NATURE Concentric structures and gravity as represented in Teotihuacan art Judith Ostrowitz Department of Art History and Archaeology, Columbia University, New York, NY 10027 Abstract Within the decorative borders that frame the painted murals of Teotihuacan, artists constructed a unique landscape. Stylized natural imagery is frequently organized according to recurring patterns. A medallion form, for instance, sometimes surmounted by a face or headdress, may be the representation of a supernatural being that floats freely, unfettered by the constraints of gravity. Disembodied hands, painted in association with this form or as components of other structures, dispense riches that fall in carefully measured streams. The painted murals of Teotihuacan teem with stylized represen tations that are based upon the forms of living organisms and materials found in the natural world. Eccentric foliage, birds, butterflies, and watery substances in the forms of droplets, clouds, rain, foam, or waves are disposed in configurations that recur throughout the corpus of painted works. Because the por trayal of nature by Teotihuacan artists is persistently organized according to particular canons of representation, the paintings suggest a certain objectivity, or the actual existence of a distinct but credible reality. Prescriptions for the organization of these elements into recognizable patterns may be associated with na ture's repetitive or cyclic processes and may appear to be guided by the same type of inexorable laws that regulate physical re ality. The citation of natural processes can function as a convinc ing argument for a particular world view. This practice may be compared with the application of a biological model to certain social phenomena that served to validate Social Darwinism and related racist theories of sociocultural progress in nineteenth century Europe. Perhaps composed to give sanction to certain social constructs at Teotihuacan, the murals function effectively as windows onto a consistently configured but unique physical plane that follows bona fide laws of its own. Confined within the decorative borders marking the boundaries of this con structed reality, images drawn from nature are organized ac cording to criteria that may be understood only when there is some familiarity with this realm as a whole and with the idio syncratic processes establishing its landscape. Certain free-floating medallions in this painted world, un fettered by the constraints of gravity, may constitute key struc tures that signify the presence of a supernatural being. These cosmic emblems, composed either of multiple bands or of chains of images drawn from nature, are organized as concen tric structures or whirlpools that are often combined with faces, headdresses, and other ornaments worn as the trappings of au thority (Figures 7 and 8). We may never know the exact signif icance of these images, but this discussion of Teotihuacan murals will suggest that beings operating outside of the "laws of nature," ones defying gravity and manipulating the processes of movement and the flow of signs in these works, incorporate information about the nature of social hierarchy at Teotihua can. A familiarity with these structures that combine emblems of high office with the extraordinary abilities of supernatural beings, may suggest useful questions about the nature of legit imate social authority in Teotihuacan society. The obligations and privileges of each citizen may have been associated with ba sic religious tenets, established to align the inhabitants of Teoti huacan with the harmonious operation of the cosmos (Pasztory 1992b). As seen, for example, in Mural 1 from zone 5a, the impo sition of a conventionalized order upon natural elements dis poses the water signs, marine animals, and both living and empty shells into meaningful representations arranged as a cir cular figure upon a patterned ground (Figure 1). Although both figure and ground contain like elements such as wavy bands, jagged sawtooth strips, and various sea creatures, they are laid out in two distinct patterns clearly suggesting two different modes of operation. In the background, diagonal bands are arranged so that courses of coiled lines contained by scalloped edges alternate with jagged zigzags or sawtooth strips. This repeated pattern of undulating diagonal lines, spaced at regular intervals, may be read as a series of waves moving across the sea. Each rolling band is punctuated with a row of shells, starfish, circles, and ex traordinary aquatic creatures that serve to denote the marine en vironment. Similarly configured patterns, inhabited by the same sea creatures, may be found in other murals that refer to wa tery surroundings. A canine-headed sea creature emerging in profile from a bi valve shell is represented several times on the left-hand side of 263</page><page sequence="2">264 Ostrowitz Figure 1.

This creature, superimposed upon a background pat tern of sawtooth bands with scalloped edges, is also found in Mural 4 from room 17 at the Tetitla apartment compound (Fig ure 2). From the same compound, another painted scene depicts a human figure swimming through diagonal scalloped lines, in terspersed with various shells (Figure 3). This person may be a diver, retrieving a shell and placing it into a net bag which is fastened around his neck (Miller 1973:136). All three of these works link the diagonal-band motif to the undersea world of marine creatures, both natural and mythological, and to the hu man divers that may be found in a watery domain. This arrangement of signs may also represent water in an al legorical sense. Another mural from Tetitla, which includes the same diagonal bands, depicts a netted jaguar approaching a temple by foot (Figure 4). Because these alternately jagged and curved strips are linked with marine environments in other works, the temple and jaguar composition may be linked sym bolically with aquatic themes.</page><page sequence="3">Concentric structures and gravity in Teotihuacan art 265 Figure 4. Mural 8, room 12, Tetitla. (After Séjoumé 1969:102-103.) Figure 5. Sculpture, Colossal Goddess. (After Séjourné 1969:235.) Although the central medallion in Mural 1 (Figure 1) is com posed of almost the same elements found among the diagonal background bands, the medallion is of a completely different order. It is the representation of water wrapped around itself in a circle. This configuration is a substantial departure from the stylized attempt to represent the sea in the background of ^T&lt; Figure 6. Mural, Zacuala apartment compound. (After Séjourné 1959: Fig. 2.) the same painting. At the center of the composition, the aquatic elements have been modeled into an abstract circular form, in consistent with the operation of observable processes, signifi cant for some purpose other than the representation of nature. This whirlpool-like medallion depicts a process of nucleation in which signs are drawn to a core. The circular form encloses a wavy band partially hidden by a quadripartite feathery em blem. The emblem terminates below with another canine headed sea creature emerging at the neck from a double scroll. Teotihuacan artists used this double volutelike formation to de note the hinged area of bivalve shells (Langley 1986:288), and this configuration may be observed in other shell representa tions such as those painted among the background bands of this same painting. Surrounding this configuration is a circle of aquatic signs: sawtooths with scalloped edges terminating at the bottom with a pair of disembodied hands. The outermost border of the medallion is composed of a coiled line, also a constituent ele</page><page sequence="4">266 Ostrowitz Figure 7. Mural 1, portico 2, platform 1 5, zone 3. (After Miller 1 973:68.) ment of the background pattern. These signs immerse the core in certain information that may be associated with the represen tation of water. The central medallion may be understood metaphorically as an "atomic structure" because it consists of a center around which a band of elements is focalized. It is specifically atomic in the sense that it may operate as a hypothetical model, a fre quently recurring base structure, regulating various materials into concentric configurations. Western scientists and Teotihu acan artists have each in their own way distinguished this "atomic" image as a model that helps to explain reality, a cos mic emblem. At Teotihuacan this structure is used by artists as a characteristic pattern to compose various works of art. This structuring principle may also operate in three-dimen sional works, inspiring the composition of a huge stone sculp ture found at Teotihuacan near the Pyramid of the Moon (Figure 5). The figure, probably the representation of a goddess, is constructed from a series of concentric bands. Lines of zig zags and spirals, possibly aquatic motifs, have been carved upon certain items of female dress such as a skirtlike garment and short cape. Seen from the front, the nearly flat figure ex hibits an unrelenting angularity in shallow relief. When viewed from the sides and back, however, it becomes clear that this rec tilinear being is built from a series of stacked, horizontal bands that resemble, from certain points of view, the layers of a cake. The figure is composed of quadrangular circuits that appear to surround the body. I would like to demonstrate that certain supernatural beings represented in Teotihuacan art may be identified not only by what Kubler (1967) has discussed as the higher rank sug gested by frontality, relative size, and elaboration, but also by a concentric structure, by the presence of multiple bands that share the same center. As painted images, these beings require no legs either to support their weight or to bind them to the "earth." In some instances, the representation of a deity need not even be frontal to be recognized as a divine being. It may in stead be positioned at the core of a series of circling bands, bound by chains of signs including some of the stylized elements Figure 8. Mural, Palace of the Jaguars. (After Miller 1 973:57.) that stand for the natural world. In a mural from the Zacuala apartment compound, a Storm God emerges in profile from a series of concentric scalloped bands containing both starfish and spirals (Figure 6). This ovoid configuration appears here as a solid little container for the centrally placed deity. Images of natural forms organized around a center are eas ier to associate with a deity or an anthropomorphic being when a face is included in the composition. The face suggests an ex pression of consciousness, a mind —or will —that elevates the otherwise blind natural forces operating through the medallion to the level of intentional behavior. This type of being, seen in a mural from zone 3, is built up around the net and eye motif at its core (Figure 7) and is surrounded by a flowering vine, star fish, and a wavy band of spiral signs. It is interesting to observe that the core area of Mural 1 (Figure 1), contains a wavy strand as well. This core is partially hidden behind the feathery em blem and therefore impossible to identify beyond question, but it may also be part of a net and eye motif.</page><page sequence="5">Concentric structures and gravity in Teotihuacan art 267 Figure 9. Mural, Teopanacaxco. Figure 10. Bird Mural, original placement unknown. (After Berrin 1988: 168.) Another deity in a mural from the Palace of the Jaguars is composed as a disk surmounted by a head wearing an elaborate headdress (Figure 8). In this example the bands are focalized around a bird emblem, and the layers of starfish and shells are interspersed with four spokelike elements. The outermost rim of the medallion appears to exude the heavy drops of a liquid substance. Seemingly the configuration itself is diagnostic for this form, whereas the elements that compose it may vary. Per haps the combination of natural elements and abstract motifs in a particular medallion indicate the sphere of operation that is specific either to this being or to its environment. On the other hand, this flexibility may simply result from the inventive ness of individual artists. This image of a divine being wearing a headdress, a costume element usually indicative of high office in the material world, is shown in these examples to float freely, transcending the con straints of physical reality. In the Teotihuacan-constructed Figure 11. Mural, Maguay Bloodletting Ritual, The Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. Tracing by Saburo Sugiyama.

(After Miller 1973:83.) world, natural elements have been combined with the orna ments of elites into configurations which function indepen dently of the "laws" of nature. Perhaps divine sanction, claimed by some leaders, is illustrated by hyperphysical ability in these images. Those in such an exalted position might have claimed the right to operate outside of the codes which regulated the lives of ordinary citizens whose feet remained planted upon the ground at all times. In a mural from Teopanacaxco, two profile celebrants ap proach a medallion elevated upon a platform (Figure 9). A rather abstract zigzag pattern, perhaps associated with water, is configured as a circular border surrounding a netted center. Here is the medallion structure pared down to its basic ingre dients. There is neither a head nor extravagant headgear to identify it as a being. It is simply a diagram of this concentric process, linked to other medallions, known and recalled from other works of art, by its netted center and single circular band that refers in the most minimal way to aquatic substances. The concentric structure in Mural 1 (Figure 1) is also recog nizable without the addition of an actual face; this abstract sign may be identified and understood only within the context of Teotihuacan imagery as a whole. Such a sign is intelligible be cause it is consistently represented by these artists. Recurring structures suggest a sphere of activity that operates according Figure 13. Mural, Hands with Droplets, Tetitla. (After Séjourné 1969: 170.) to strict laws of its own, modeled upon the unrelenting cycles of nature and formulated for its own purposes. Not all circular configurations in Teotihuacan murals should be understood as medallion beings. The bird seen in Figure 10 holds a circular shield and a spearlike weapon that associates it with military concerns. In addition, circular hip ornaments, which may also be either military dress components or elements of attire associated with high political office, are commonly rep resented at Teotihuacan (Figure 11). Round shape alone is not diagnostic for the cosmic medallion. The sculpture of the Colos Figure 14. Mural, Divine Hands, Tetitla. Drawing by Agustín Viilagra Caleti. (After Berrin 1988:200.)</page><page sequence="7">Concentric structures and gravity in Teotihuacan art 269 Figure 1 5. Mural, Great Goddess, probably Techinantitla. (After Berrín 1 988:72.) sal Goddess, for instance, is completely rectilinear, and the Storm God painting from Zacuala is somewhat ovoid. What is required of this structure is that various elements, perhaps de scriptive, perhaps not, be arranged around a core. The impetus for artists to organize elements around a cen ter is a powerful configurative force in these paintings. The painters' desire to give all objects in proximity to such a center a medallion form appears to be checked only under specific cir cumstances. These exceptions are accomplished through the op eration of a natural law —the positive response of objects to the forces of gravity — selectively obeyed by Teotihuacan artist cosmographers. Although the medallion being may resist gravity's pull, other objects, failing to do so, fall in this painted world. Some materials do descend, but only under specific cir cumstances, at certain key junctures, and even then fall a lim ited distance —not all the way down. In a mural from zone 5a, a concentric being surrounds a net and eye disk and wears a feathered headdress (Figure 12). It holds two curving, bannerlike strips that surge around and then down from its clawed hands in the manner of a liquid gushing forth with great force. In this painting the artist allows centrip etal force to be overcome by gravity, and small objects —shells, a mask, a nose ornament, a tiny hand, and many small circu lar items —escape the dominant pattern and descend as very solid-looking streams. In these painted murals, the effects of gravity may cause gifts to fall down from the hands of "higher beings," but gravity exerts little power over the natural elements that circulate in space as free-floating supernatural. In the world that can be glimpsed through these murals, objects appear to submit to the law of gravity as a metaphor for beneficence. Gravity asserts it self upon the streams of gifts falling from disembodied hands. In Mural 1 (Figure 1), the inconsistent effect of gravity upon the circular structure is clear. The outermost undulating band of the medallion being radiates at the top and sides, free from Figure 1 6. Mural 4, room 7b, zone 2, Palace of the Jaguars. (After Miller 1973:52.) the constraints of gravity. At the bottom, where the band has come into contact with the two hands, it is suspended like heavy droplets. This image is similar in form to the drawing of a Tetitla mural that also depicts drops of liquid suspended be tween two disembodied hands (Figure 13). These actions take place in an entirely synthetic world where objects of equal weight may float or fall as necessitated by signification. Gravity, as it functions in the natural world, asserts itself</page><page sequence="8">270 Ostrowitz Figure 17. Mural, Scattering Seeds, Tepantitla. (After Miller 1973:100-101.) upon the streams of gifts that fall from the hands of the medal lion being. In many of the murals, hands are an important point of transformation whereby nucleation may be mediated and gravity may be observed as a metaphor that affects the dispen sation of the gifts. Thus hands, tools for manipulating objects in the physical world, frequently function as the instruments of a beneficent will—even when supplied with a full set of dangerous-looking claws. Apparently, hands may function as signs of divine admin istration, capable of interrupting the flow of a dynamic process even outside of the context of medallion structures. The border of the "Divine Hands" mural at Tetitla (Figure 14) consists of a flowing band of woven threads in a succession of elaborate knots, connected by a continuous, circulating thread (LaGamma, personal communication, 1990). The hands that alternate with these knots mark those points where the threads begin to widen into small cascades filled with circular objects that are perhaps seeds. From behind these falling panels, the threads emerge again and continue along the circuit. This configuration, as well as many other images constructed by Teotihuacan artists, ap pears to be associated with flow and movement, indicating per haps that these compositions serve within this hypothetical landscape as artifacts of various dynamic forces that circulate, move in waves, and walk in procession. The medallion, or the presence of this concentric process, may often be found in Teotihuacan art in association with the flow of god-sent gifts. In a mural presenting an image of the Great Goddess (Pasztory 1988a), probably from Techinantitla, flower-filled streamers emanate from the mouth, which is the center of this configuration (Figure 15). The streamers then sweep upward and become a part of the outermost band of the slightly rectangular medallion. In this composition, a close con nection exists between the materials identifying the actual body of the being and the substances issuing from it. The flowery scrolls may signify either a part of the being's concentric body, a valuable substance originating from the being herself, or some form of speech or sound issuing from the mouth. In Mural 1 (Figure 1), those substances that compose the body of this being and either the product or the descending gift that issues from it overlap once again. As noted, the water droplets serve in one part of the configuration as a part of the being's circular body and in another part as its product, as the liquid gift that flows from the being's hands. The deity, com n A, rK T zzx Figure 18. Miniature temple, Atetelco. Drawing by Felipe Dávalos. (Af ter Miller 1973:164.) posed of natural materials, serves as a representation of process or movement, the practice of dispensation. The being may it self be that dynamic, portrayed as it appears for a single fro zen moment in the continuous act of giving. These concentric images may be associated with certain pat terns of movement that resurface repeatedly in Teotihuacan art. Although a portion of Mural 4 from the Palace of the Jaguars, for instance, supplies only minimal descriptive information as compared with some of the other painted works, this mural may be read by one familiar with these characteristic flowing patterns (Figure 16). The shell forms are abbreviated signs consisting of circular and linear elements that may be identified as shells only when they are compared with some of the more elaborate represen tations of bivalve and pecten shells seen in other works. The wa tery element is established through the presence of simple, wavy bands. The dictates of an underlying structure, however, con</page><page sequence="9">Concentric structures and gravity in Teotihuacan art 271 Figure 19. Temple of Quetzalcoatl, reconstruction drawing. (After Marquina 1964:86.) tinue to organize these elements in accordance with the charac teristic laws of the Teotihuacan painted world. A series of footprints extends along the upper border of the painting, showing a procession from left to right and another set extends down the center of the picture, left footprint alter nating with right. This progress is flanked on either side by a path of shells. At a certain point, the footprints enter a semi circular section. Inside this rounded space, the shell-lined path ends and the footprints diverge, extending in two directions and then exhibiting a more diagonal orientation at the extreme right and left. Once the footprints extend to the circular field, their linear orientation is interrupted. One clear path becomes two, and the directional orientation of the footprints changes its or ganization. This image indicates that the progress of linear movement may be transformed within a circular space, outlined by wavy bands, thereby setting off these spaces as extraordinary spheres of activity. We may recall here that in Mural 1 (Fig ure 1), the linear background structures are made up of exactly the same elements as the central medallion. The response of the structures, however, to a central vortex transforms them from a relatively simple wavelike progression across a marine envi ronment into the body of an exalted being. This model might suggest certain implications for the struc ture of ritual processions at Teotihuacan. One may imagine the linear progress of celebrants toward a temple or a platform sit uated at the center of a courtyard; indeed, a file of ambulant figures, thought to be priests, was often painted at Teotihuacan. In the procession, the line of costumed celebrants might cast seeds or other precious substances and invoke the deity with metaphors involving flowers, shells, and precious jewels (see for instance Figure 17). They might then approach their destina tion: a miniature temple such as the painted patio at Atetelco (Figure 18), or on a grander scale, the Pyramid of Quetzalcoatl Figure 20. Frescoed tripod vessel, Teotihuacan. (After Séjourné 1969: 172.) in the Ciudadela (Figure 19). (Note that both of these structures are composed of layered bands, circuits of stylized, natural el ements that completely surround them.) Here, at the center, the direction of the priests' movements might change to become cir cular, more complex, or in some instances random.</page><page sequence="10">272 Ostrowitz Figure 21.

The importance of his progress in a circular path around the vessel is indicated by the manner in which he walks along the lower border of the painting, as if the border, composed of a very solid substance, were a road around the vessel. The murals of Zacuala, reconstructed as they might have been, covering all the walls of an interior courtyard (Figure 21), are also drawn in a manner emphasizing circulation around a center. The drawing suggests a sense in which the images may have functioned to surround a space —in this instance by a type of measured, linear progression. Though a clear circulation of painted imagery around an enclosure is not always present at Teotihuacan, there is often a sense that the viewer would be completely surrounded by the images and immersed in the signs painted around the walls. In a reconstruction of the Tetitla apartment compound (Figure 22), as in other painted environ ments, the designs, which do not neatly fit each wall or panel, are not seen as discrete units. Instead, some of the images in the corners are only partially visible, implying that the patterns con tinue on and on, occupying some larger space that reaches be yond the confines of a single courtyard. The viewers then must understand that they are at the very center, a most significant position, of vast and patterned surroundings. CONCLUSIONS The constructed version of nature represented within the Teoti huacan art corpus has been organized to conform to certain forces or processes. These recurring patterns of movement are expressed in the formation of certain structures such as medal lions, linear bands, and falling panels. An "atomic" form in particular is found as a characteristic pattern in Teotihuacan art, used to denote supernatural beings. The centripetal force animating the concentric bands of such medallions may be com promised by the application of gravitational pull to some por tion of the objects that surround the beings. This altered flow indicates the dispensation of precious gifts. Because these images are the artifacts of patterned move ment, they could, in some way, be related both to ritual proces sions and to performances. Moreover, as prototypes, they may represent fundamental apprehensions about social reality at Teotihuacan, expressed through the powerful medium of reli gious symbols and associated with the forces that operate in nature. For instance, a central authority might have been con ceived of as one surrounded by valuable substances, some portion of which, in accordance with natural law, must be dis bursed. Furthermore, human representatives may have been as sociated with these supernaturals depicted in a constant state of levitation. The priests, like the gravity-defying deities, may not have been restricted by the laws, natural or manufactured, that governed the lives of the citizenry. Teotihuacan artists selected and reproduced those aspects of nature felt to be essential in structuring a metaphor for power. They were concerned above all with a subjective version of re ality represented as a second form of nature that existed just be yond the confines of everyday life. This separate reality, a landscape of Teotihuacan's own making, was devised accord ing to the precepts of its intrinsic worldview. RESUMEN Los muralistas de Teotihuacán crearon escenas profusamente decoradas con imágenes estilizadas de la naturaleza. La vegetación, las aves, las mariposas y el agua se hallan representadas de manera excéntrica y están consistentemente organizadas en configuraciones que pueden asociarse con los procesos inexorables de la naturaleza. En los bordes decorativos que rodean a estas pinturas, se halla implícita una realidad inventada que obedece leyes físicas ideosincraticas. En este artículo, la autora asocia las frecuentes instancias donde aparece la forma del medallón, compuesto de bandas concéntricas de elementos naturales, con la representación de un ser supernatural. Este medallón, con frecuencia combinado con algún rostro, tocado de cabeza, u otros adornos que pueden ser representaciones de la au toridad, flota libremente, indiferente a las limitaciones de la fuerza de gravedad. Sin embargo, cuando los objetos de este mundo pictórico en tran en contacto con un par de manos desprendidas de todo cuerpo hu mano, muestran entonces su suceptibilidad a la fuerza gravitacional. La presencia de estas manos puede significar un importante punto de trans formación donde aquellos elementos naturales en forma de bandas cir culares se convierten en tableros descendientes, llenos de semillas u otros objetos de valor que fluyen en corrientes de aspecto muy sólido. Debido a que estas imágenes toman formas repetitivas, podría pen sarse que, de alguna manera, tienen relación con los actos rituales de los sacerdotes o con otros espectáculos públicos. Más aún, si se toman como prototipos, podrían representar ciertas nociones fundamentales de la realidad social de Teotihuacán, expresadas através del poderoso medio de los símbolos religiosos asociados con aquellas fuerzas que ope ran en la naturaleza.
