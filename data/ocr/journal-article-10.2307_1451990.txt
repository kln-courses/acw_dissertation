<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAADIA'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE by ISRAEL EFROS, Dropsie College THE problem of knowledge occupies a prominent place in Saadia's work. It is woven into the discussion of his Emunot ve-De'ot, the introduction of which is devoted to a systematic presentation of this subject. There are also many important epistemological statements in his com- mentaries on the Bible and the Sefer Yesirah. He did not accept the idea maintained by his Arabian contemporary, Alfarabi, that there is a spheral spirit called the Active Intellect, who moves our sense-experience to conceptual knowledge; so that, according to him, the mind had to be its own agent in the process of percepts becoming con- cepts. How is this agency to be conceived? What is the part of experience in the process of thought, and what, if any, is originally mental? What, furthermore, is the role of the mind with reference to faith or, as he calls it, tradi- tion? These questions we shall seek to answer in this essay. There are, according to Saadia, three sources of knowl- edge: sensation, nous (intuitions), and necessity (necessary inference). "And we, the congregation of monotheists, believe in these three sources and add a fourth which we have derived from the other sources, namely reliable tradition."I Guttmann has shown that in this doctrine of 1 Emunot ve-De'ot (Warsaw, 1913), introd., 43-44: lvcN,i D'D WD nWv i?b ...1 iNK m'D n-m-rrw n ny-t rw9nl zmvwn y-tnr n "W1 3t.rn nyp-p 1rD Dorrb -amn Z o31 a m'&lt;Dv it D D'o W nD m,=o U6 nIi D3; Dm'-DPin ,nip m1na iy rnil tn '- ll=bKrn bntin v-ml W1W 1: i n iW ncn l'nc iniW I iiK ln '3-1 r,,w nvI ,;~1m , ynDl iinn yn-i.

Our discussion will follow the order of these four varieties of cognition. I. SENSATION 1. The nature of sensation, as presented by Saadia, shows traces of two Greek influences. In the introduction to his Emunot ve-De'ot (Warsaw, 1913), p. 45, he speaks of a conjunction (Ar. 41j, Heb. pl3r) between the eye and the object. In Em., I, 74, he says: "It is known that our eyes perceive only that which is composed of four ele- ments, for their natures combine (Ar. 4a:;, Heb. m,nmnnn) with the natures of our eyes. If there were a fifth element, it would have nothing kindred in our eyes with which to combine so as to be perceived." And in Em., II, 102, he p-rKYN mtnz .

J::, Heb. m,nnnnml) with the forces of their kind in the seeing eye by means of the air." We have here the Aristotelian emphasis on color, as well as on air as a medium. This medium, Saadia emphasizes also in Em., I, 70 for the auditory, olfactory, and visual sensations. But Aristotle did not assume any direct con- tact between the eye and the object, but only a color- stimulus, an excitation, carried by the medium from the object to the eye. It was Empedocles, followed with some modification by the Stoics, who maintained that vision is due to an emanation from the object, an efflux of tiny particles of the four elements which combine with their kindred elements in the eye; and exactly the same view is stated in the aforegoing passages of Saadia.3 2. In agreement with Aristotle and the Stoics, Saadia affirms the utter reliability of sensation. Whatever we perceive by means of a contact between the object and our sense-organ is undoubtedly true as perceived. Any idea which is contrary to our perception is false.4 On the verse in Sefer Yesirah: "Establish the thing on its evidence and erect the Creator on His foundation," he comments: "The meaning of this is that the only way to prove the existence of the wise Creator is to prove the realities.

This light is really a light and that shadow is really a shadow; this hot object is truly hot, and that cold object is truly cold; there is no doubt about this substance, nor about that accident."5 The opening of this passage reveals the motive of Saadia's realism; namely, to have a solid foundation of reality in order to build on it a cosmological proof of God. This procedure, from the world to God, characterizes the open- ing of his Emunot ve-De'ot, as it did also the system of the Mutakallimfn; but while their cosmological basis is, as shown by Maimonides in his Moreh nebukim, I, ch. 73-74, a distrust of the senses and an atomism of space and time requiring a constant creator, Saadia differs radically in basing his proof on a complete trust of the senses and in maintaining a permanence of substances which comes up again, as we shall see, in his theory of miracles. His realism seems to go beyond the Stoics who distinguished between the sensation, e. g., of heat, and the statement "this is hot," regarding the latter as not strictly a sensation but as a mind-picture, a fcavraata, which may be an error.6 But Saadia took cognizance of the possibility of error in sensa- tion. We must beware of illusion, lest we take a reflection for a reality. And we must furthermore beware of two causes of error: insufficient knowledge of our object and carelessness in our search of the object, else we are likely to miss a person even though he stands before us.

Sensation admits no difference in the degree of validity, for all men are equal in perceptual knowledge; and no man has any superiority over another in this respect, not even over animals.8 It is also the foundation of all our concepts, the basis of all our knowledge. Reason extracts its cognition from perception even as we extract gold from minerals. Our mental knowledge then is deriva- tive (iktisdb), and to reject sensation is to eliminate also the second and third sources of knowledge. Hence where perceptual evidence is available, no further proof is neces- sary; and all knowledge, progressing only by means of perception of matter, comes to an end when we transcend the apex of the material universe.9 And hence, Saadia regards the mutajdhilun, among whom he includes the Sophists, who deny the truth of both sensation and reason, as exceeding in folly all the other classes of sceptics: sensationists, relativists, and agnostics.

An answer to this question is to be found in our next section. II. Nous 4. This source, which gives us our immediate knowledge, is called by Saadia 'akl (Heb. sekel),- which we translate by the term Nous, used by Aristotle to indicate the faculty of immediate cognition in distinction from Logos" - and also tebunah, or understanding.

The example given in the introduction to the Emunot is the proposition that truth is good and falsehood is despicable; but the scope is much wider. It includes such conceptual matters as spring of themselves and become apparent by themselves like fractions, equa- tions and square roots, like the idea that a hundred equals a hundred or a half of two hundred; it includes the prin- ciple of contradiction that being and non-being cannot be attributed to the same thing at the same time; and it includes the idea of the existence of God.'6 In Em., III, 106, IV, 127: =rnr miqyi rrc-i- nn,vtii lN r.innn Ipi.

First, we must meet our benefactor with reward if he needs it, or with gratitude if he needs no reward; and hence divine worship and gratitude. Second, the wise man does not permit himself to be reviled and cursed; and hence no blasphemy of God. Third, God forbids his creatures to sin against each other; and hence all laws prohibiting social wrong- doing. These were meant by Saadia as knowledge of the second class, as is shown by the following consideration. 1) The first principle is sometimes given by Arabian and Jewish thinkers as an illustration of self-evident proposi- tions;I7 2) The principles are given without proof but, as "universal necessities of thought," which reflects the Stoic term KoLvat EvvoLca. 3) Saadia states concerning them that God implanted in our mind - a phrase to which we shall revert later - a sense of rightness of the acts which they dictate and a sense of wrongness of the doings they forbid. 4) At the end of that section, Saadia states that reflection (Ar. JAt;, Heb. nmniDznn) would disclose the reasons of the rational laws, and then proceeds to the dis- nrt nIN imw i 'mlnm opninnn. The grouping of this principle with the other two intuitions shows that its origin is meant to be the Nous. Indeed in Em., III, 107, it is stated as implied in the self-evident idea that truth is good and falsehood is despicable: in,etnD il nonn 1]m y,'nl ... mnK1, n -1v3 n' -n by rI'DNm n i mn rm ... =Trn mlrl p-r' -:- ymDj,n -iyvnl nlDDsinDni WnM 33n1mzn: 3V nnnM'pD ,nnSlr mnn: 19n: D3mmn ,'iy 'n1 l:'Tr.

This is indeed in keeping with his promise in Em., introd., 44, that he would prove tradition by means of all the three sources: sensation, intuition, and inference (the proof from sensation is con- tained in the opening of that section). There is also one other body of knowledge which the mind accepts without call for proof, namely, a people's oral traditions governing its religious, political, occupational, and domestic life; but more of this later. In Arabic and Hebrew medieval philosophy, the prop- ositions requiring no proof are usually divided into four groups: perceptions, axioms, moral conventions adopted by all or most peoples, and traditions.'8 These can be traced back to different origins. The origin of the first two groups is Aristotelian;19 that of the third is to be found in the Stoic doctrine of KOtval Cvvotla and consensus gentium, the Arabic and Hebrew names for this group (Ar. mashurdt, Heb. meforsamot) meaning Kotval; and that of the fourth is, as we shall see, Peripatetic. Saadia is in complete agreement with the ultimate character of these groups. Perceptions, no doubt because of their distinct channels of approach to the mind, he regards as a class by themselves. The arithmetical axioms and the Law of Contradiction are illustrative of the second group; the ethical laws, of the third; and "reliable tradition," of the fourth. The question is: where would Saadia place the idea of God, not as "necessity" but as immediate knowledge? The Stoics re- garded it as a consensus gentium, one of the KoLvac evvotat, and it would therefore be placed in the third group. But I8 Ibid. and Rua.i Hen, ch. 6. 19 Arnold, op. cit . 138. 141</page><page sequence="10">142 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW [34] Saadia's idea of our immediate knowledge of God is not Stoic. Nor is it entirely in accord with the view of Ruaz Hen, ch. 6, which places it, for those who have not attained it by means of reason, in the fourth group. Saadia regards it as the beginning of knowledge and its first affirmation, and hence would place it in the second group, together with mathematical and logical axioms.20 The appeal of the idea of God is not to its universality but to its inherent self-evidence. 5. The causes of error in this type of knowledge are dreams and faulty investigation.21 Dreams are the product neither of the external senses nor of inference and hence belong only to immediate knowledge. Perhaps the relation is also to be found in a common psychic origin; for, accord- ing to Aristotle, the same imaginative faculty which gives rise to dreams is also employed in the field of conduct,22 which is, as we have seen, a large part of the realm of immediate knowledge. Similarly, the author of Rua.h Ifen, ch. 6, states: "those laws which have been accepted by all peoples, like those prohibiting theft and murder and com- manding filial honor, are called rational laws, because practical reason which is of the imaginative faculty accepts them." And also for the 'first ideas,' the muskalot rishonot, we have the authority of Avicenna who states that these are formed by the constructive imagination which he calls 20 Comp. however Horovitz, op. cit., 51, n. 94. 21 Em., introd. 45: Nm,rl y9m 5n 5X)n 12n, ,'7 -'X, nWv i: nlmi lnm D 31i In li iDtW1 1'pryn Q p'9v ID -int ii 1"- yvw ine po Pin 1' S nrN yn niDinm. The word =..l (=31',n-) is in brackets in the Arabic text. It certainly implies nothing distinct from dreams which alone are discussed by Saadia in the sequel. It corresponds to the term "phantasms" (avvrao-jiarCa) applied to dreams both by Aristotle and the Stoics. See Zeller, Aristotle, II, 72; Arnold, op. cit., 132. The same word C..k3)l is used by Saadia on the same page for false per- ceptions. 22 Hammond, op. cit., introd., LXI, n. 1.</page><page sequence="11">[35] SAADIA'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE-EFROS mufakkirah.23 If so, we gain also a special locus in the brains for the Nous or the source of immediate knowledge, namely, that of constructive imagination, or the anterior area, as different from discursive reason located in the middle area. Saadia too uses the term fikr, perhaps both as constructive imagination and as the Nous, in Tafsir Mishlei, 96: "the power of fikr and memory and discern- ment in the brains" (D 'n"6t r Tnn1il m'Tml nDAK mrnIH. Similarly Em., X, 202: ;nirni innrm ;n ), which classification thus conforms to Galen's classification of internal senses into imagination, thought and memory.24 Hence it is because of a common psychic origin that dreams may be said to be the errors of the Nous. Accord- ing to Saadia, dreams are mostly erroneous, arising from the thoughts and the food of the past day and from the chyme dominating the temperament. Yet they contain "a slight hint from on high" (Em., introd., 45). Aristotle also, though opposing in his systematic works the idea of God- sent dreams, was inclined in his earlier popular writings to give them credence.25 At any rate, the sphere of the second class of knowledge becomes now further enlarged by the inclusion of the prophetic element of dreams. As to the other source of error, Saadia says: "we must know how to think and complete our thinking" (ibid). This statement seems strange as applied to self-evident knowledge requiring no proof. Let us also point to another difficulty. In Em., introd., 43, he says that the second and third sources of knowledge are built on the first so that to deny sensation is to deny also immediate and mediate 23 See A. M. Goichon, Lexique de la langue philosophique d'zbn Sind, s. v., ;jSZk. 24 For Galen's classification and the term n:D, see Wolfson, "The Internal Senses" in Harvard Theological Review (1935), 72, 91. See also infra, n. 36. 25 Zeller, Aristotle, II, 77; Gomperz, Greek Thinkers, IV, 186, 215. 143</page><page sequence="12">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW knowledge. The difficulty is that the second source be- comes inferential and therefore no different from the third source. How then are we to understand the preconcep- tions as dependent on sensation and thinking and at the same time as self-evident? The answer is that just as we saw in the case of perceptions that error may arise in the search of a percept through insufficient knowledge and lack of thoroughness, so because of the same factors errors may arise when we seek the general preconceptions in individual situations. Thus, Epictetus in his Discourses, I, 22, emphasizes: "Preconceptions are common to all men... When then does contradiction arise? It arises in the application of our preconceptions to the particular cases... Education means learning how to apply the natural preconceptions to the particular cases." Similarly in the realm of arithmetical operations, the self-evidence of the number of which 100 is a half, applies also to the number of which 178 or 1897 is a half, the finding of which may require some patience and technique. The self-evidence of an idea does not necessarily imply the self-evidence of the road leading to it. The thought as it springs in the mind may at once command our assent, but it is not always recognizable in the heavy garments of reality; and we need Saadia's caution "to know how to think and com- plete the thinking," which according to Saadia is always based on sensation. Lying is ugly, but before we condemn a person we must carefully study the given case until the moral truth of the situation reveals itself in its self-evidence. 6. What precisely is the meaning of the a priori nature of this second class of knowledge? Kaufmann thought that the name as well as the illustrations leave no doubt that Saadia meant innate ideas.26 Horovitz on the other hand pointed to Saadia's statement that "all knowledge 26 David Kaufmann, Attributenlehre, 2, n. 3. 144 [36]</page><page sequence="13">[37] SAADIA'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE-EFROS is based on what we perceive by our senses" as proving that Saadia's position was pronounced empiricism (ausge- sprochener "Empirismus"), and concluded therefore that the passages in Tafsir Mishlei, 13, 29 must be interpreted in accord with strict empiricism. In the same manner, the Stoics too speak of ELUVTroL 7rpoXrjeLf even though, as Zeller maintained, no innateness was intended.27 Now as for the last point, more recent scholars do not seem to agree with Zeller;28 and Saadia, at any rate, might have taken those expressions literally. Even Aristotle, who "contests the possibility of any innate knowledge" (Zeller, Aristotle, I, 200) was nevertheless understood by Alfarabi as maintaining that the mind accepts the first principles by endowment and nature from childhood on.29 But let us examine Saadia's utterances on this subject, and we shall find that he goes even beyond this view attributed by Alfarabi to Aristotle. We saw that he emphasized in several places that all our knowledge is based on our sensations, that it is derivative or iktisdb. But as against these there are several utterances pointing to the contrary. There are the two passages mentioned by Horovitz. The first reads: "The meaning of mishpat is what the learner grasps of those religious matters in which reason holds sway, commanding all that God implanted in the mind as worthy and renouncing all that God impressed upon the 27 Horovitz, op. cit., 50, n. 94. 28 Ludwig Stein, Die Erkenntnistheorie der Stoa, 271; R.

The second states: "Since there are two ways of obtaining wisdom, one being in the nature and substance (of the mind) and the other by acquisition, the sage divided his utterance, and said concerning the acquisitional kind, 'Happy is the man who findeth wisdom,' for he searched and found; and concerning the 'substantial' kind, he said 'and the man that getteth understanding' for it comes by the grace of God."30 Now as for the first passage, Horovitz does not mention that the same idea with similar phrasing is found also in the Emunot where these "implantations" are called, after the manner of the Stoics, "universal necessities of thought" so that there too and also in his commentary on Proverbs, 179, we would have to interpret the text in harmony with strict em- piricism.3' But how can such an interpretation be applied to the second passage mentioned by Horovitz, where tebunah is sharply differentiated from 1okmah in not being acquired but in being of the nature and substance of the mind, a grace of God? But there is another very inter- esting passage which not only disproves empiricism but also shows us how to reconcile the contradictory state- ments and indicates the relative functions of thought and experience.

The same is true of the other organs of sensation. Similarly there is in the mind a knowing force which, when confronted by intel- lectual matters, verifies them, so that the person becomes convinced that they are undoubtedly the concepts. Accord- ing to this example all knowledge lies concealed in the mind; and the purpose of learning and inference is only to discover it after its awakening, so that when it stands before the mind, the mind testifies concerning it that it is the truth."32 Now it is true that Aristotle in De anima, III, 4, 429, a25, favors the Platonic dictum that the soul is the place of ideas- Kal e)v 8 ot XYO7ovr7s rmv lvX/rv elvat TO7TOV ?ESv - but he emphasizes that, before knowing, the mind has a mere potentiality of knowing, so that the dictum is reduced to mean that a potential mind is the place of potential ideas. This distinction between poten- tiality and actuality, so basic to Aristotle's dynamic philos- ophy, was not a part of Saadia's metaphysics, which is based not on the notion of matter and form but on that of substance and accident. Saadia's statement therefore is not in accord with the Aristotelian view but rather with the Platonic theory of innate knowledge; except for the fact that Plato, who believed in the pre-existence of the soul, spoke of Anamnesis, or recollection, and Saadia, who denied that belief, spoke of awakening. Knowledge then lies concealed in the mind, and reflection only discovers it, 32 Tafsir Mishlei, 9: 1'-r y mKDl3iK ,W9 1in7D KNJ1nmroK nblyl=DDDiK MinNmy lp IpiKt '9D J1- .DNli%n 'pHz NM-r 'mip r' Nbi ylnDmb inK mN 'iN i ' ,n uqN Dmit -my nYi Kun' mp,'K filpyDoN m1DiK KnlnySo KKEm9 IrlmD5 MD3K Ipy S ',M 31D 1nm3 y D3 i: N1DK K7'm ,Iyp .-n.ipyD6t hmno 5py5 3n3K 1n Kn9 b NmAKK Nry:n m 't K-nDy' KyN 'Di NDHi onDi1 ypnn ipin '9 toy lmnr]'9 r-I1631 3tnoIK tN4 iy3 1a-T^D .pnmK t n'?y TnrW.

One more statement may be cited to disprove the complete dependence of the mind upon sensation. "It has become clear to me that the soul is wise through its own essence, because of various reasons. (1) It cannot acquire its knowledge from the body, for the latter has no wisdom. (2) It has been verified that the blind person dreams that he sees; so that if he had no visual experience through his body, he must have ob- tained it through his soul. Hence he who believed the soul to be a juncture and combination and contact of senses was mistaken, because since it is the soul which gives the organs the power of sensation, how could they give it substance?"33 From all this we learn that to Saadia the mind plays by no means a passive role in the process of learning, that it is not a blank tablet, but that quite on the contrary it comes endowed with all knowledge; that this knowl- edge requires awakening through experience and through reason working on the material of experience; and that in so far as our innate knowledge has to be discovered and made articulate, it is at the same time all based on our sensation. Saadia's view then is radically different from thoroughgoing empiricism. It is both empiricism and rationalism, it is empirical rationalism. He even goes beyond the Stoics who limited innateness to our common notions. The difference between Saadia's second and third source is only that in the first case the mind through 33 Em., VI, 153: (innb't ?noiy) nxy) nDn ntrn twmn ', ', -innn n:y: 'lnyl .t3yD nr 1'Kt ', ,zln 1D nn nn nnpw l.n' i?

In both cases, there is only a discovery, even as the ear discovers music. Learning does not produce, but only awakens and recognizes concepts. III. NECESSITY 7. The third source of knowledge Saadia calls "that to which necessity leads," "knowledge of necessities," "neces- sary knowledge," and also metaphorically "righteous- ness."34 For the meaning of the term, let us quote from Aristotle, Metaph., 1064b35 (see also 1015b5): "necessity (a&amp;vayK/) not in the sense of violence, but that which we appeal to in demonstration" (4&amp;ro&amp;ltLs). Saadia offers various examples of necessity: from the indication of fire in the presence of smoke to the construction of astronomical theories on the basis of observations of lunar movements. But he seems to include also analogy35 under necessity. To Aristotle, there are only two kinds of scientific thought: induction and deduction. While Saadia, as we have seen, acknowledged these two processes (analogy is but an imperfect induction), his description of correct thinking presents a somewhat different picture. There are two elements, he says, in the attainment of knowledge: instruction, i. e., learning the principles and roots of science from previous scholars, and discovery or acquisition, i. e., un- folding the implications and corollaries. These involve 34 Vide supra, n. 1 and Em., introd., 51 nnm:i yl'a, Ar. 6aYI15 mnn:6m2i.

Reception is called hearing while in the process of obtaining ideas from an outside source; when completed, it is called learning. Retention is the power to store up ideas so that they can be recalled. Exploration is the mental wandering about. If the subject of investigation is a reported action, it will divide it into its parts; and if the meaning of a text is examined it will gather all the possi- bilities - leaving out none - that may help to explain it. And discernment, which should always come after ex- ploration, is the power to discriminate among all these possibilities; so that in the case of an action, it will approve what is worthy and reject what is unworthy, and in the case of an idea it will accept what it can regard as true and repudiate the false, without taking into consideration the opinion of people, be they few or many.36 Similarly, in his commentary on the Sefer Yesirah, he says: "Man must first know, then reflect and discern, and then believe....

These must be embraced by the power of synthesis. When all these points are before you, and you have omitted none, the faculty of analysis begins to operate, rejecting all that is false and accepting only that which is true, or approving that which is good and disapproving that which is wrong. When the work of the analytic faculty is done, the faculty of belief accepts that which was discerned and judged, adopts it and guards it. It is for this reason that the author says: 'Know, think, and believe'."37 This process of elimination beginning with the widest possible base of possibilities, is illustrated by a rather ex- treme and artificial example which Saadia gives for the time-taking character of thought. We can conceive, he says,38 of ten steps in a quest of proof. (1) Proof is speech, speech is sound, and sound is of many kinds. (2) We eliminate sounds of inanimate things, then (3) sounds of irrational animals, (4) natural human sounds, (5) sounds of single letters, (6) single words, (7) combinations of words which are not complete sentences, (8) necessary and impossible propositions which require no proof, leav- ing only the possible proposition, which (9) we prove, and then (10) drawing the conclusion. Thus, Saadia says, the thinker begins with a tangle of things, upon which he applies the process of elimination, obtaining nine possi- bilities from ten, then eight from nine, and seven from 37 S.

Another feature of the process of thought is stated by Saadia in the form of six propositions. First, the begin- nings of knowledge are coarse and their ends are fine. It starts with sensation, which belongs to both man and beast, and proceeds, through a process of abstraction, from matter to its qualities, then to quantity, and thence to space and time, until it reaches its goal which is finer than all the stages that preceeded it. Second, man reaches a state of knowledge after which there is no knowledge, i. e., knowledge is finite. Three reasons are given for this prop- osition: (1) man being limited in his body must also be limited in his powers, one of which is knowledge; (2) knowledge can be encompassed by man only because it is finite, for otherwise it could not be encompassed and therefore it could not be known;39 (3) the root of all knowledge, the percept, being undoubtedly finite, the branch cannot be infinite. Third, knowledge is an ascent from stage to stage, because it has roots from which it springs, and is therefore different from ignorance which is only an absence of knowledge. Saadia emphasizes at some length this idea that ignorance being only negative and rootless cannot serve as stages for ascent to the top where the idea of God resides. It is a call for rationalism in faith. Fourth, the last stage furnishes the subtlest notion of all. Fifth, we must not conceive our last notion in as coarse a form as our first, for thereby we distort the process of knowledge. Sixth, in fact, we destroy all the fruits of our labor and return to ignorance.

We begin with a broad and concrete basis; and as we climb, the material thins until we have nothing to hold on. But, says Saadia, the finest is also the strongest, even as the soul controls the body and wisdom governs the soul, and the degree of potency among the elements is in an inverse ratio to their solidity.40 8. No less than Yehudah Halevi, Saadia is aware of the limitation of mind and of its inability to solve certain problems. There is the problem of the nature of God, whose attributes, except that He is loving, wise, and omnipotent, cannot be known.41 There is the problem how the four elements came into being out of nought, and why fire rises and the wind is elusive and water flows and earth sinks. Coming to the world of combined elements, we face many unanswerable questions; what is the nature of the stars and their respective distances and motions; what is the nature of mountains, seas, and rocks; what is the nature of animals and why their respective organs and passions; and why does one number have a square root and another number does not have it.42 But Saadia stresses these limitations of reason not, as Halevi, in order to aggrandize the faculty of faith, but to direct the mind to its proper sphere where alone it can be productive and fertile. "It is only after agreement is reached on the insolubility of these problems that true investigation and research become possible."43 More about this in ?11. But even in its own sphere the mind must be wary of pitfalls, for here, even to a greater degree than in the 40 Em., II, 86, 94, 95. 4I Em., II, 91, 92; TafsZr Iyyob, 109; Tafslr Mishlei, 142; S.

Saadia offers therefore a number of rules of inference and sum- marizes them under five headings. First, an inference is invalid when based on a sensation which can be explained with the aid of another theory. Second, it is invalid when based on an idea which can be explained with the aid of another theory. Third, it is invalid when it contradicts another truth. Fourth, it is invalid when it contradicts itself. Saadia's explanation must be added here. When one infers from his own experience of an action that the good is pleasant, one must realize that some one else may find the same action distinctly unpleasant, so that there will be two contradictory evaluations of the same act.47 Fifth, the rejection of a view is invalid when it is as re- pugnant, or even more so, from the standpoint of the basic principle, as the acceptance of that view. An example of this is the antithesis of the idea that God cannot bring back the yesterday because it would limit God's power - an antithesis which is worse than the thesis because it ascribes absurdities to God. In this summary, Saadia does not state the rule he gave in his general discussion before the fifth, namely that a thesis cannot be inferred from a 44 Em., introd., 44. 45 Ibid., 37. 46 See Arist., De mem, 450a6, and my "Some Aspects of Yehudah Halevi's Mysticism" in the Proceedzngs of Amer.

It seems that he includes it in the fifth rule of the summary, for both have parallel phrasing and are basically the same: not to infer an idea from a principle when the opposite is equally acceptable, or when it is equally repugnant as its opposite, from the standpoint of the same principle.48 To these rules, Saadia adds his two cautions: to guard our sensations and intuitions against illusions and dreams, and to be patient and avoid haste and carelessness in our investigation; so that altogether we have seven rules of thought.49 This last caution is of Stoic origin. According to the Stoics, error is due either to a hasty movement of the will or to a feebleness of the will;50 similarly, according to Saadia, error results from "seeking knowledge too lightly," "hastening to judge before the completion of the logical process," "becoming quickly annoyed or impatient to the extent of being unable to complete an investiga- tion," and also from "feebleness of heart."5I The Stoics spoke of wrong assent as sin (&amp;aaprta, peccatum); Saadia calls it i; (Heb. trn).52 The Stoics urged careful atten- tion or application (irt/3oXr/); Saadia insists upon j,^ and J^A, perseverence and deliberateness.53 9. There are therefore two kinds of belief: true and false. A belief is defined, by Saadia, as "a notion springing in the soul concerning a certain thing in a certain con- dition. And when the butter of thought is churned, the mind encompasses it and grasps it and takes it into the 48 Comp. however Shebil ha-emunah on Em., introd., 48. 49 Em., introd., 45-48. 50 Arnold, Roman Stoicism, 68, 133. s5 Em., introd., 37, 51; Arnold, 1. c. 52 Em., introd., 41; Arnold, 1. c. 53 Em., introd., 41, 49; Arnold, 1. c: 155</page><page sequence="24">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW soul and fuses with it; and the man believes the notion which came to him and stores it away in his soul for another time."54 Then Saadia proceeds to state that belief (i'tikad) may be true or false. It is true when the person knows the thing as it really is: small or large, white or black, existent or non-existent. It is false when he thinks the reverse of what the object really is. This is the correspondence-theory of truth, and we find it in Aristotle, Metaph., 1027a20; 1051-35. Hence, Saadia in- sists, the wise man is he who regards the facts as funda- mental and lets his thought be governed by them, whereas the fool thinks that the facts follow his opinions.55 Mai- monides in Moreh, I, 71, quotes this idea from Themistius, and Narboni remarks that he should have quoted it from Arist., Metaph., IV, 5: "If the thoughts and opinions of men were all true, then everything would at the same time be true and false; because frequently one man be- lieves the opposite of another, and thinks that those who have not the same opinion as he himself are wrong." The connection between this passage and the Themistius- Saadia dictum is somewhat remote, as was pointed out by M. Friedlander in his translation of the Moreh (ad. loc.) and Neumark in his Toledot ha-pilosofia be-Israel, II, 373. A much clearer statement, probably the source for The- mistius and Saadia, is Aristotle's Metaph., IX, 10: Ov yap aLT ro jLq'as o'eOaL a1C X s (e XeVKOv elvaC el av XevK6s aXX&amp; 6LL b ro - XEVK6V elVCat lEZs olt cavres rorT a&amp;X\r- OebVuev.

We have to explain two difficulties in the quotation from Saadia: first the rather verbose and unclear descrip- tion of the act of belief; second, whether belief can be false when carried through the entire description or only in a part thereof. From the fact that just before this cited passage, Saadia ascribes "the churning of butter of thought" to the good and patient thinkers, and from the above cited passage where Saadia says: "Man must first know, then reflect and discern, and then believe" implying confidence in a belief which follows the synthetic and analytic process of thought, and furthermore from a com- parison with the views of other thinkers, it must be evident that falsehood can apply only to that kind of belief which is described in the first sentence of the quotation, namely, "a notion springing in the soul" without investigation or proof. This is also the way Maimonides defines it in Moreh, I, 50, i. e., as "a notion conceived in the soul," ex- cept that he stipulates, what is implied by Saadia, namely, "when it is accompanied by belief that it is (in reality) as conceived." It is what the Stoics called aUVyKar&amp;aOoLs, or assent, which is an act of the will and may be true, or false. It is what Plato called b6ta, opinion, as different from Ct7rtLTrI,7, knowledge (Theaet. 187A). It is what Isaac Israeli called 'bn5N in his Book of Definitions -see Arabic fragments, published by H.

Here a grasping and a seizure is described, cor- responding to the second step, called by the Stoics KaraCXitLs, which Cicero translates by comprehensio, and 157</page><page sequence="26">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW which is a ratification of the assent, a grasping as with the hand. Thus Cicero in his Academica, I, 41, reports about Zeno: sed cum acceptum iam et approbatum esse com- prehensionem appellabat, similem iis rebus quae manu propenderentur. This act of encompassing is so essential to the act of cognition that Saadia inferred that knowledge must be finite, for in order to be known it must be encom- passed; and Maimonides inferred that the infinite since it can not be encompassed, can not be known.56 Saadia's idea of fusion goes back to Aristotle's doctrine in his Metaph., XII, 7: "for it (i. e., thought) becomes an object of thought in coming into contact with and thinking its objects, so that thought and object of thought are the same;" but it is also the next step in Zeno's theory, namely the integration of the comprehension with the mind in which it becomes firmly rooted so that no arguments can remove it. Thus Cicero further reports in his Academica: et si ita erat comprensum ut convelli ratione non posset, scientiam, sin aliter inscientiam, nominabat, ex qua con- sisteret etiam opinio quae esset imbecilla et cuma falso in- cognitoque communis. It is what Zeno meant by his last gesture when after he had opened his palm and called it 'picture,' and then partially closed his fingers and called it 'assent,' and then made a closed fist and called it 'com- prehension,' he closed in the left hand over the right, and, pressing his fist tight, he said 'this is science.' It is this science which Saadia calls i'tikdd, belief, or really, con- viction. Similarly, Maimonides concludes his discussion of belief: "If in addition to this we are convinced that the thing cannot be different in any way from what we believe it to be and the mind can find no argument for the rejec- tion of that belief . . . then the belief is true." Thus, as we interpret Saadia, he posits two kinds of 56 See supra, n. 39. 158 [50]</page><page sequence="27">[51] SAADIA'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE-EFROS belief: the assentive belief which is an act of will and may be true or false, and the cataleptic or comprehensive belief which is an act of thought and is true. Both apply to subjects of religion as well as of general science. The criterion of truth is the mind: Saadia trusted in careful and patient thinking for the attainment of truth.57 The problem of the meaning of belief recurred in Jewish thought. Maimonides, accompanied by Narboni, entirely followed Saadia. Crescas, who opposed in his Or Adonai (Vienna, 1868), 49, the idea that the will plays a role in belief and that belief can be true or false, really denied assentive belief. Albo in his 'Ikkarim, I, 19, and Abrabanel in his commentary on Moreh nebukim, I, 50, both of them insisting that belief is an acceptance of a transmitted religious doctrine on the basis of its prophetic or miraculous origin, discarded completely the rationalistic view of Saadia and Maimonides. If we may anticipate a distinc- tion, which we shall make later, between 'amanat and 'i'tikadat, they affirmed the former and denied the latter. IV. TRADITION 10. The idea of tradition as a source of knowledge, Saadia took over from the Mutakallimun. But they did not originate it. It came to them from the Syrians; for Paula Persa in his Logica says: "Knowledge, either a man seeks and finds, or it is acquired by instruction. Instruc- tion is partly transmitted directly from man to man, and partly by men who came with a message, i. e., from the angels." The Syrians in turn took it over from the Aris- totelian commentators; for, as J. P. N.

This source is necessary in addition to sensation and reason. "I have heard," says Saadia in Em., III, 109, "that there are men who say there is no need of prophets and apostles and our minds themselves can guide us to a knowledge of right and wrong." He does not specify here who these men are, but elsewhere he refers to the Brah- mans as maintaining that view.59 Saadia however argues that not all that is necessary for man's salvation is im- planted in the human mind, that unaided reason cannot determine the precise way of observing even the rational laws. The mind decrees gratitude to God and the 'messen- gers' teach us the formula and its seasons. The mind abhors adultery and the prophets define it. The mind re- jects stealing, but when does acquisition end and stealing begin? The prophets standardize it. If we were left to ourselves, there would be confusion and disagreement.6? s8 J. P. N.

Philosophy, though capable of unfolding the truth, takes time. Some cannot attain re- sults in their thinking because of some defect, some may become wearied in the process, and some may be confused by doubts. Hence the need in the interim for prophets and apostles, without our relinquishing the slow process of thought.6' Saadia does not state like Halevi that religion goes further in its discovery of divine truth than philoso- phy. According to him wherever religion asserts, reason can prove.62 This does contradict his admission of the limitation of philosophy, noted in ?8, for to prove the ex- istence of a thing does not necessarily mean to understand its essence or causes. Logically then, though not ontologi- cally, nor etiologically, there is no superrational margin in religion, and Halevi's conflict between faith and reason does not exist for Saadia. See also ?? 13, 14. 12. The validity of tradition is sanctioned by the three other sources. Sensation authorized the beginning of tradi- tion, which was accompanied by overwhelming miracles. These were of two kinds: violation of natural laws and transformation of substances. The transformation was always pre-announced to avoid loss of confidence in things.63 Intuition dictates, as we have seen, the three principles, the "universal necessities of thought," which underlie the rational laws, and also a fourth principle, the admissibility that God imposes duties upon man in order to reward him, which accounts for the non-rational laws.64 And "necessity" finds causes and benefits for these laws.65 6i Em., introd., 51. 62 Vzde supra, n. 57. 63 Em., introd., 44, 51; III, 11C, 113. 64 Em., III, 106. 6s Em., III, 107-108. 161</page><page sequence="30">162 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW [54] Reason approves not only the particular contents of tradi- tion, but also tradition per se, in sacred as well as secular realms; for without it, man would lose much guidance in commerce, crafts, and conduct, the king's laws would be disobeyed except by those who hear their proclamation, ancestral inheritance would be questioned, and parenthood itself-a matter of doubt.66 Saadia's statement: "God made room in the minds for the reception of faithful tradition and a place in the souls where it may rest, in order that His books and traditions may be known to later generations," and the nature of the illustrations, seem to show that the assent to tradition is meant to belong to the second class of knowledge, to be intuitive rather than reasoned, though discursive reason too approves the con- tents of tradition. This is in keeping with the general Jewish and Arabic view, which, as we have seen, goes back to Alexander of Aphrodisia, that the mekubalot or tradi- tions require no proof. To be sure, Saadia recognized the possibility of error in tradition, as he did in the other three sources of knowledge. By mistake or intention a false tradi- tion may come into being. But this is impossible when a tradition originates in a mass of people where mistake and fraud cannot escape detection.67 13.

The Bible posits the authority of sensation, intuition, and in- ferential reason, so that whatever contradicts them is false.68 It commands us to engage in philosophy and investigation within the sphere where solutions of problems are possible.69 Within these limits, the sages never meant to discourage thought. They only cautioned against put- ting aside the prophetic teachings and relying upon the mind to attain the truth; for we may never attain it and, at any rate, in the meantime, we will live in error.70 Hence whenever a Biblical passage seems in its literal sense to run counter to reason or tradition, it must be interpreted and harmonized therewith. "I will lay down a rule that wherever a statement occurs in the Scriptures, describing God and His deeds, which ... contradicts what true reason affirms, there is no doubt that it is a figure of speech." "Whatever is in the Scriptures must be taken literally except where it contradicts sensation, reason, other passages of the Bible, or tradition; in such cases there is reward for a harmonizing interpretation." Hence all passages that are anthropomorphic or deterministic must be interpreted. But there are limits to this privilege and duty to interpret. To explain away commandments is to be a false prophet; to abandon the literal meaning where the doctrine of crea- tion is involved is to be a heretic; to regard resurrection as symbolic is ultimately to take the story of creation and miracles and the traditional commandments as symbolic and thus to leave the Jewish fold.7' These are beyond the 68 Em., introd., 44; IX, 189. 69 Em., introd., 49, 51.

The title of Saadia's main philosophical work, Al-'Amdndt w'al-'I'tikdddt, has been usually rendered by "Faith and Reason," implying a conflict between them which the book is to reconcile. Malter in his Life and Works of Saadia Gaon, 193, renders it by the "Book of Philosophic Doctrines and Religious Beliefs" which does not differ from the usual translation, except for unaccount- ably making faith and reason change places. Neumark in the Hebrew Union College Annual, I, 523, rightly dis- approves of this rendering because mpnry "is used for the designation of religious beliefs, dogmas (so Halevi, Maimuni and others)."72 His own view is that rNpnyN designates preferably the faith of the speaker and that the title means therefore the philosophic and religious views of Israel and the philosophic and religious views of other peoples with whom Israel, or Saadia, is in conflict. But Neumark, too, overlooked the important passage in the introduction from which the title was taken. "What brought me to this (i. e., the writing of the book) is that I have observed many men in their 'amdnat and 'i'tikdddt, some of them have arrived at the truth and know it and rejoice with it... and some arrived at the truth but do not verify it nor uphold it... and some have verified the absurd which they think is the truth and uphold the false and abandon the straight... and some occupy themselves with a certain opinion for some time and then reject it... then they betake themselves to another opinion and again despise it...

Here we see that both 'amandt and 'i'tikdddt refer to the same people, men in general, and Israel in particular, and also that no distinction is to be made on the basis of true and false, for Saadia complains that he has found them both incorrect or unsubstantiated, requir- ing correction or a firm rational basis. It is for these people that he wrote his book, giving the right dogmas ('amdndt means primarily faith and trust, and hence the acceptance of an idea on faith or divine authority) with such rational substantiation that they may become cata- leptic beliefs or convictions.73 "Dogmas and Convictions" - this is how we should render 'Al-'Amdndt w'al-'I'tik&amp;ddt. That this is the correct meaning of the terms is further proven by the following expression in Saadia's chapter on Resurrection, as published by Bacher in the Steinschneider- Festschrift (Heb. part, 101) where after refuting objections from natural laws to the doctrine of resurrection, he says: ,n t' ;rn 't, ,pny ipli which is meaningless on the basis of Neumark's differentiation and can only mean "and my conviction of this dogma has become established."

Maimonides' aim was definitely a reconciliation between faith and philosophy. Saadia, who had not yet felt the full impact of Aristotelianism on re- ligion, saw in philosophy a support and stabilizer for religion, which the people for whom he wrote the book, who either had unclear religious doctrines or were vacillat- ing because of a lack of verification and rational firmness, needed. There was no conflict then between knowledge and religion; they were both, Saadia said, man's orna- ment in both worlds.74 15. The question however arises: is there any difference in priority between tradition and reason? We have seen that where the Bible conflicts with reason it must be interpreted; but this does not answer our question, for in those cases, Saadia would say, the interpretation gives us the only intended meaning. But contrary to Malter's idea that Saadia regarded reason as secondary and religion primary - an idea which Neumark opposed without giving full evidence75- it can be shown that the reverse is true. Among the kinds of priority discussed by Aristotle in Categories, 12; Metaph., IV, 11, and by Maimonides in Millot Higgayon, 12, there are three which pertain to our discussion: time, nature and substance, and rank. The first and the last kinds are clear. As to nature and sub- stance, Aristotle defines it as the quality of "those which can be without other things, while the others cannot be without them." Now it can be shown that Saadia re- garded reason as prior in all these three senses. He main- tains that there is no value in the observation of the 74 Tafsir Mishlei, 16: l'pmn4i '9 1D iN ]'t NV by'Di 1- 1 i 6y b -rnp.yil t175 ln' Na, pop y it . 75 Malter, op. cit., 175, and Neumark, op. cit., 524. 166 [58]</page><page sequence="35">[59] SAADIA'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE-EFROS traditional laws unless they have been preceeded by the observation of the rational laws, namely justice and fair- ness, which constitute the entrance or the isagoge of religion.76 This is perhaps only temporal priority, though Yehudah Halevi, in Kuzari, II, 48, who took this view over from Saadia, called it a priority both of nature and time. Nothing but temporal priority is meant also in Em., III, 122, and TafsZr Bereshit, 3, where Saadia states that the Torah is not the only source for our laws and beliefs but that there are two other sources: reason before it and tradition after it. But Saadia also explicitly gave reason priority in the sense of substance. In Em., VII, 163, he states that he examined four sources of knowledge: nature (i. e., sense-perception), reason, Scriptures, and tradition, to see whether there is any refutation to the dogma of resur- rection, and that he "began with nature because its priority is that of substance." Thus in an arrangement according to substance, i. e., epistemological indispensability, reason is prior to the Bible. Similarly in Em., IV, 128, he states that he has proofs for the doctrine of the freedom of will from perception, reason, Scriptures, and tradition, and he proceeds to discuss them in that order. In Em., V, 147, and again in Em., VII, 165, he gives the same order; whereas the order in Em., VII, 171: "Scriptures, reason and tradition," can only be accidental. Of particular signifi- cance is the statement in TafsTr Mishlei where he gives the order of the sources of knowledge as minrni % mw: DD om1nD=im lpD5il ln=Dm 'py1 pirl 'naWt 'rm and adds that the author of the book of Proverbs should have fol- 76 TafsZr Mishlei, 140: pm: lo apy i: ',KN 5DU' 'Don DfitKim1 wI1TOD 5Mp Myz mn,wrnM v D .ynnDNi p3D ilD r .yn iiD'. m1 nDm1 l31 tnky ynny y-n1 2 k r nr nK srnD 'n -mmnN nyNYM6i .JnInlD' DI nD'9 Drp' 11 VT7 KN1 iDfDnn YD' Hi ...

Now what are these sources? Horovitz in his Psychologie Saadias, 48 n. 90, 51 n. 94, identifies them with the four sources of the introduction of the Emunot except for the division of tradition into the Bible and oral tradition. This is incorrect for the following reasons First, if 'istinbdt means here necessary inference or deduc- tion, its place after the Bible and tradition does not con- form to the order established in the previous quotations. Second, 'atl here cannot mean here the Nous or immediate knowledge, for Saadia designates it also as r",Dnn 6y which is, aswe have seen, the faculty of discernment.78 It must therefore mean here, as in all the previous statements of the order of the sources of knowledge, thought in general, immediate and mediate. This is another reason why 'istinbat, the fifth source, cannot mean here inference 77 Tafsir Mishlei, 126-27: ~py^wl ; T,-Nm i ' -1f DiOnIK ~IxI fDi: 'TNK ip^N PIYI lpKYD DD13D 1D ynu . ... fltnDKH1l lipuNi r DlnoD i .m. ,nD' Ai1 -Iy ITp i: 1pK Kin1 mn3 a'' fp3 -yn ' p,u KDlir nI'pr' n3DiymK n-iBWi lnD-ipD nDNp- '-rt to"mni Day Di ...

What then does 'istinbdt mean here? Elsewhere79 Saadia does use this term in the sense of inference, but here he designates it himself as tabrir (he calls also the Talmud tahrer in dis- tinction from the Mishnah which is fikh), i. e., an accurate study of a text,8? leading, as he himself states, not to new ideas but to new ways of grasping the true idea. Perhaps he had in mind kiyds, maintaining like the Zahirites that the conclusion is not an innovation but is included (mafhum) in the text.8' The term 'istinbdt too is used by Arabs as an elucidation of a particular Koranic text by the "verbal resources" obtained from the reading of the whole text.82 The place therefore of 'istinbat or tazrir is therefore logically after the Bible and tradition which it uses as its text. Thus we see that in this passage, also, where the author emphasizes what he thinks is the order of the sources of knowledge, sensation and reason come prior to the Scriptures. But reason is prior also in the third sense, that of rank and excellence. Hence in Em., introd., 51, Saadia asks why faith if philosophy leads to the truth, and answers, as we 79 See n. 36, above, and Tafsir Mishlei, 141: Dm=nDKNS D1Pi DNDpHl 6yn1il 6Pnniti. 80 The term ni-nn usually means exact investigation.

But Saadia employs the term also in the sense of an accurate study of the words of a text, sometimes for the purpose of substantiating certain views or doctrines.

This is also the position of Bahya in his Al-Hiddja 'ila Ford'id al-Qulub, ed. Yahuda, p. 15, and of the author of Rua4 Hen, ch. 6. Bahya, though stating that "tradition is prior by nature because learners need it at first" --%p b I mI4 nilnm iwl lnoynn't rrinr p'" In yzuciMM njpm in 1}^ tit - essentially agrees to the "interim-theory" of Saadia. Hence also, as we have seen, his purpose in writing the Emunot ve-De'ot is that he who believes by tradition may begin to believe by reason. Hence, furthermore, with all his emphasis on miracles, he maintains that if a prophet proclaims laws that are repugnant to the mind, even if he attests his utterances by miracles, he must not be obeyed.83 CONCLUSION Saadia starts with four sources; but sensation is basic to all, even to axiomatic knowledge which sense-experience helps to bring out in life's complex. As for reason, it is prior to tradition the basic ideas of which we should strive to grasp philosophically, so that our 'amdndt may become 'i'tikdddt. Unlike Maimonides, he saw no conflict between faith and philosophy; and unlike Yehudah Halevi, he re- frained from tearing them asunder and giving to each its own domain. Fundamentally then there are two sources: sense and reason. Between them there is a mutual need. Sense requires mind for its subtilization into concepts; and mind, though it comes equipped with ideas, needs sense-exper- ience for their discovery, i.e., for its own self-conscious- ness. Thus Saadia's theory of knowledge differs from Platonism in its realistic attitude to objects of sensa- tion, and from both Aristotelianism and Stoicism in its thoroughgoing rationalism. 83 Em., III, 117. 170 [62]</page></plain_text>
