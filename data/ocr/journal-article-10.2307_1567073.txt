It is the proper study and labour of an artist to uncover and find out the latent cause of conspicuous beauties and from thence form principles for his own conduct.' Joshua Reynolds 1 According to the incantations of a recent vogue of criticism, the purgatory of mod- ern architecture is over and paradigms, once lost, are now being regained. We learn that "modernism" sinned by reject- ing convention and tradition in favor of utopianism, functionalism and a cult of in- novation (to mention only some of the supposed ills) and that architectural salva- tion will ensue once a new communion with tradition has been made. Little is said about the criteria that may be em- ployed to judge the relevance of one tradition over another, or about the dif- ference between bogus revival and a valid transformation of precedent. Diffuse nostalgia is given a vague shape by op- position to a common "modernist" en- emy. This adversary turns out to be a curious caricature of some of the progres- sive platitudes of a particular phase of the modern movement. Modern architecture emerges as a monolithic and determinist entity without subtle internal dissensions or varying preoccupations and tradi- tions of its own. Le Corbusier, Aalto, Wright, Mies van der Rohe and the rest are rammed together with the most de- based modern buildings and urban sche- mes as a sort of collective demonology. Thus an era is distorted and rejected with something of the simplemindedness that the pioneers of modern design employed in the rejection of their nineteenth century predecessors. The misportrayal of modern architecture embodied in this critique is not entirely the result of propaganda. Ironically, it seems to stem from a warped vulgariza- tion of the view of the subject presented by writers like Giedion and Pevsner nearly half a century ago. These early historians were preoccupied with defining the ways in which the new architecture was dif- ferent from past ones, and with distin- guishing a supposed genuine twentieth century style from the "evils" of nine- teenth century eclecticism. Their picture was somewhat undiscriminating over the relative value of individual works and art- ists: it stressed links to modern technol- ogy, to progressive social thought and to the ideal of a modern machine age. The model was historicist in that it presumed a Zeitgeist at the heart of the historical and cultural process striving for a holistic expression in visual form. This became the stock-in-trade view in architecture schools in the 1940s and 1950s, when it was also generally assumed that modern architecture must be a good thing. Little wonder that the recent backlash should have been so sweeping, for it has ac- cepted the historical model while confer- ring on it entirely negative connotations. "Post-modernist" folklore relies for its very definition on the idea of modern ar- chitecture as a uniform and essentially rootless phenomenon. This is not the place to sketch a revisionist history that might take into account the absorption of the past into individual vo- cabularies within the broad framework of a shared period style; or that might treat modern architecture itself as a complex tradition of evolving types, motifs and themes. If the modern movement in- volved forward-looking utopian myths concerning the dawning of a new age, it also involved radical ideals to do with the return to fundamentals. Wright deserves to be taken seriously when he speaks of a "cause conservative" or of reinvoking "that elemental law and order inherent in all great architecture,"2 and we do well to remember that Le Corbusier, the poet of Esprit Nouveau, sought touchstones in an- cient Greek temples as well as siloes and cars. It impoverishes and misportrays the imaginative structure of these individuals to remove an essential tension that ex- isted for them between the most enduring values of the art of architecture and the need to cope with unprecedented prob- lems in industrial civilization. If one probes beyond futurist rhetoric and be- yond the outer skin of style, one encoun- ters the ambition to formulate an architec- tural language with the rigor and depth of principle of the great styles of the past. The Villa Savoye, the Unity Temple, the Barcelona Pavilion-all buildings with ob- vious place in the standard sagas of mod- ern architecture-also deserve a place in any study reassessing the essentials of Classicism. "Post-modernist" dogma pre- sumes that abstraction involves divorce from the past, but in the right hands it may become a device through which the artist enters the past on a number of lev- els simultaneously and then transforms its lessons into an authentic form in the present. Squabbles between "post-modern" and William J. R. Curtis 182</page><page sequence="3">William J. R. Curtis 183 "modern" tend to have limited critical value precisely because they oversimplify the relationship between invention and precedent. Both sides in the debate are guilty of describing externals of architec- tural dress without differentiating be- tween the genuine transformation and the pastiche. A soggy critical method can easily ensue which is unable to distin- guish between Mies van der Rohe's Lake Shore Apartments, for example, and the routine steel and glass box or-come to that-which fails to understand the dif- ference between a profound Renaissance work like Bramante's Tempietto, and a de- valued revival of the same formula. The method reaches its lowest point when precedents are called in as talismans to confer automatic value on copies of them, no matter how feeble. Such critical dan- gers attend any scheme of classification which stresses the communal aspects of style at the expense of the individual work's special order and synthesis. This is precisely where the question of authenticity is hit head on, for it is that nebulous quality which confers symbolic and formal vitality on even a wellworn formula. One thinks of the Parthenon, a sublime order within an accepted type, or of Hawksmoor's Mausoleum at Castle Howard, a descendant of Bramante's Tem- pietto which has an utterly rethought meaning and character of expression; or one thinks of the tension and poetry of the Villa Savoye as compared with the dullness of Gropius' Harkness Commons Dormitories, a building employing analo- gous stylistic elements like pilotis and strip windows. Dead forms, mere replica- tions of motif, lack a certain tightness be- tween idea and form, and, perhaps as a result, their visual effect is tired and with- out vitality. One is tempted to paraphrase T. S. Eliot and suggest that the good work of architecture "communicates before it is understood": its deepest and indivisible symbolic powers are exteriorized through patterns of forces that have an immediate and dynamic effect on the emotions and thoughts of the observer. The authentic work transcends the mere mechanics of iconographic convention and touches on areas of a more lasting and more univer- sal symbolism. It maintains an expressive presence long after the codes of particular cultural messages have been forgotten; symbolic and intuitive potency exist far beyond the mere legibility of signs. If the authentic symbolic form has a cer- tain indivisible character, something simi- lar is true of its relationship to personal and period styles: it blends together a number of stylistic strata from the past in a new and irreducible amalgam. Focillon has astutely written that the principle un- derlying a work of art is not necessarily contemporary with it: the imagination obeys no simple linear chronology and refuses to be trapped by a single time slot. This is why, for example, it is pre- posterously simpleminded to call H. H. Richardson a "Romanesque Revival" ar- chitect. His architectural system received nourishment from ancient Roman via- ducts, from Early Christian work in Syria, from Romanesque examples in the Au- vergne and in Spain, from Renaissance Florentine palazzi, from Viollet-le-Duc's versions of medieval fortifications, from New England vernacular structures, from the inherited schemata of nineteenth cen- tury Beaux-Arts Classicism-and so on. What really matters is that this architect managed to forge these obsessions and sources into a consistent architectural lan- guage appropriate to both his own sen- sibility and the cultural problems of his time. Similarly it oversimplifies Wright or Le Corbusier or Aalto just to call them "modern." They too had their roots in various past traditions: even those of their works that conformed most ob- viously to the rules of the "International Style" had utterly different internal chem- istries and links to the past. One has only to think of the transformation of Classical examples in Le Corbusier's villas of the 1920s to realize that the best "modern" work has rested on a capacity to rethink tradition in new terms. Authentic works possess a sort of temporal depth and res- onance: it is even tempting to suggest a substructure of values essential to the medium which is tapped by works of prin- ciple no matter what their period. Part of the power of the authentic work stems from the mythical dimension in the artist's mind. Central personal concerns are liable to crystallize as formal, and the- matic obsessions which in a form-maker of depth will have a certain ritualistic ca- pacity to address the values of a broader culture: conventions and societal as- sumptions may then be refashioned into a terminology of personal force and cogency. The crucial issue is, once again, a profundity of synthesis. But this will be facilitated if the artist has certain type- forms and patterns of visualization that can be gradually perfected to contain the appropriate content. The individual's fam- ily of forms emerges gradually as he William J. R. Curtis 183</page><page sequence="4">William J. R. Curtis 184 extends tradition and begins to clarify personal themes. Eventually, through con- stant trial and error, a stylistic identity, which is still capable of flexible usage, emerges. The true style is the opposite of a dead formula: it is a basis for percep- tion and expression; it supplies consistent devices for ordering ideas and forms ac- cording to intuitive rules and, despite rep- etition, it is a restraint that allows creative freedom while giving that freedom a di- rection and an aim. In a sense every artist is an "eclectic," since he draws on many past examples to define his true manner, yet there is still a vast difference between the superficial as- semblage and the authentic work. The strength of the latter lies in its greater for- mal presence, in its power to move through the action of forms, spaces and proportions, in the fitting expression of a significant content, in the submission of details to the vitalizing Gestalt at the heart of the work. Parts and whole, elements and system, will seem to have an inevita- ble and, as it were, natural relationship to one another. The artist who has found an appropriate language for a genuine myth will also possess the imaginative force to forge together past experiences into new unexpected wholes which are utterly con- vincing. One thinks of the extraordinary "rightness" of Palladio's fusion of the Classical temple front with the rural ver- nacular, despite the lack of any obvious connection between the two; or of the Plaisaunce Garden by Lutyens where a pergola vocabulary of polygonal pointed roofs is combined with Doric supports in a magical new synthesis. The solarium of the Villa Savoye is another example of an unlikely combination (ocean liner funnels, Purist paintings, etc.) which still emerges as an indissoluble imaginative com- pound. The strength of a genuine fusion, in contrast to the mere concoction or rep- lication lies in a realm of intuitive appro- priateness which far transcends any passing ideal of grammatical correctness. The key to success seems to lie in a forge of abstraction linking disparate elements. The pastiche lacks such bonds of form and content and remains a superficial ma- nipulation whereas the authentic work is the vital expression of a deeply felt idea. 2 There is no simple check-list for a quality as nebulous as authenticity, especially as there will never be a concensus over artistic excellence. Still it seemed worth mapping out the limits of the subject, and insisting that criticism grapple with the difference between the genuine and the fake, rather than advertising fads and fashions. The time has come to concen- trate on the genesis of particular exam- ples. I have chosen two relatively recent buildings which belong, in a broad sense, to the Modern Movement, but which also transcend their period, as profound works of art will tend to do. The first is Le Corbusier's Parliament Building at Chan- digarh (1953-63); the second is Louis Kahn's Parliament at Dacca (1962-70). Both buildings are rich in institutional and cosmological meanings, both possess an archaic character, and both stem from a stage in modern architecture which had long since rejected a wholly mechanistic utopia. Both are works of maturity resting on clearly formulated architectural princi- ples and languages, and both are steeped in Eastern and Western monumental tra- ditions. To dig down beneath the surface of these works is to confront the trans- forming power of authentic style. Le Corbusier's Parliament (figure 1) stands among the other monuments of the Chandigarh Capitol, and contributes to the actual and figurative "head" of the city. Within the acropolis complex itself it is the visual and symbolic counterpart of the Justice building opposite, whereas the Secretariat is subsidiary and to one side. The intended crowning element, the Governor's Palace, was not built, so the Parliament is the dominant structure. The building is obviously a cousin of the late works like Ronchamp or La Tourette. Complex curves come into tense opposi- tion with a cartesian grid to generate the dramatic effect of an espace ineffable. Heavily weathered bare concrete lends an ancient and primeval character to the building as if it had stood for centuries rather than decades. A number of rhetori- cal devices are used to impress the sig- nificance of the building's function on the observer. The entrance is signalled by a long, low portico over a giant enamel door preceding an inward-looking box into which the main "objects" of the as- sembly funnel and the senate pyramid have been set asymmetrically. Thus the internal hierarchy is expressed clearly on the exterior, but these forms also cause a constant tension and opposition as one moves around; they seem to draw the far distant setting into dialogue with the building. On the interior, the funnel- hyperboloid descends into a shaded hy- postyle with a grand order made from William J. R. Curtis 184</page><page sequence="5">William J. R.

The outer fringes of the box other than the portico are given over to offices on a much smaller scale and are furnished with deep cut brises-soleil which catch the shadow and give the building an even greater sense of gran- deur and gravitas. In the hot season, when all is parched and brown, the Par- liament rhymes with the outcrops of the Himalayan foothills in the distance. Im- peccable control of mass, silhouette and surface ensure sculptural tension from any viewpoint. The result is a building of solid dignity, as befits an emblem of state. To trace the genesis of the main forms is to watch a mature style in action and to see various precedents and examples being absorbed into a work of architec- ture with its own expressive rules. When Le Corbusier was employed to design Chandigarh in 1951, he fixed the city plan quickly, blending together the principles of the Ville Radieuse, with vistas and bou- levards stemming from the Baroque (or even from the example of Lutyens' New Delhi) which he adjusted to the require- ments of a democratic state government for the Punjab.3 Like his British predeces- sor, Le Corbusier sought a synthesis of Eastern and Western values in his designs for the monuments, but where Lutyens had had the job of anchoring the rule and splendor of the British presence, Le Corbusier had the complex task of expres- sing the traditions and the capacity for in- novation of a newly independent India. He concentrated most of his attention on the Capitol monuments beginning with the Governor's Palace (figure 2), even- tually abandoned, in which he established the main symbolic motif of Chandigarh: the upturned crescent form supported on stanchions and creating a shaded space beneath it. Thus his initial response to India was cli- matic, and it was this that led him to the common-sense device of a horizontal shading parasol against the rigors of the tropical sun and the monsoons. Such a formulation stemmed naturally from his architectural system, since horizontal overhangs on slender posts were virtually intrinsic to his vision of a concrete archi- tecture. The practical was rapidly turned into the mythical as Le Corbusier sought ways to poeticise this direct acknowledg- ment of natural forces. Among his travel sketches are some comparing upturned roof structures in vernacular buildings with the silhouette of bulls' horns (figure 3). The bull was a longstanding obsession in Le Corbusier's paintings and drawings, and in this context may have had a specif- ically local symbolism related to his feel- ing that India might attempt to preserve longstanding peasant and "natural" val- ues while still benefiting from industrial- ization. As Le Corbusier seems to have dabbled in "the delights of Hindu philoso- phy," sacral overtones related to oxen may have been intended too. But the up- turned crescent seems also to have been a transformation of an ancient symbol of authority, the umbrella. Perhaps this was known to Le Corbusier through examples like the caves at Ajanta, in which the um- brella could in turn be found standing on a horizontal base extending into space. Or perhaps he grasped the image through the much later variant in Islamic architec- ture, the "chattri" or domical parasol lifted on supports with a shaded space beneath. Indeed, the Governor's Palace, portrayed at the other end of a sequence of pools and level changes, silhouetted dramatically against the sky, recaptured something of the character of the audi- ence chamber or Diwan-l-Khas at Fathe- pur Sikri (figure 4). It seems likely that Le Corbusier grasped intuitively the extent to which Islamic architectural vocabu- laries resulted from a crossbreeding of imported forms and longstanding in- digenous ones. He simply added an- other step to this process of symbolic transformation. But his aim was not to express another imperium. The dome, with its overtones of centralized, undivided authority and di- vine sanction for the head of state, would not have been an appropriate symbol even if Le Corbusier had been capable of using one. In his view the symbolic form was a dead one, no longer engaging emergent social realities, and an imper- missible one given his preexisting archi- tectural language. So the parasol-dome was transformed into a counter-shape which may, in Le Corbusier's mind, have had a new connotation related to the "Open Hand," an emblem of international peace and generosity embodying the art- ist's pan-cultural idealism. The upturned shape served further to link the building to the sky and the planets above. Thus a single shape which had already served a variety of representational functions in Le Corbusier's oeuvre, and which possessed certain intrinsic anthropomorphic quali- ties, was blended with new practical, structural, and symbolic purposes.

R. Curtis 187 Neither the Governor's Palace, nor the Open Hand sculpture designed to replace it, was built. But analogous ideas did find their way into the Parliament Building. This began life as a large shaded box pre- ceded by a tilted portico of which the top surface was upturned to act as a gutter; as at Ronchamp, Le Corbusier was evi- dently intrigued by the idea of a roof as an enormous sluice for the rain. The inte- rior arrangement extended a deeply en- grained Corbusian pattern: a free plan with curved partitions defining the main functional organs within a grid of sup- ports. It was when problems of lighting, ventilation and rhetoric came to the fore that Le Corbusier broke the assembly form up through the roof to create a light- ing and airing system, and a shape with symbolic potential. Among his early doo- dles were ones referring to the penetra- tion of sunlight and moonlight; there were even curious references to "noctur- nal festivals." (figure 5). But while cosmic overtones were intended, the hyperboloid shape seems to have been inspired by an industrial form: cooling towers. The syn- tax pattern which placed a curved stack in the heart of a box was nothing new: it was a variant on a scheme that Le Corbusier had employed as early as his 1920s villas. But at Chandigarh the stylis- tic motif was rethought to the demands of the new context, and given new associa- tions. In one version a spiral was shown winding its way around a funnel shape. This provided a practical walkway for the cleaning of skylights, a leitmotif of the Modulor and an image of growth and as- piration: one wonders if Tatlin's Monu- ment to the Third International may not have exerted an influence? And surely Le Corbusier knew the stunning spiral mina- ret of the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo, with its stair rising towards heaven? Evi- dently the artist stopped off in Cairo be- tween Europe and India and visited some of the classic sites. But conceptually, the funnel was less a minaret than a re- thought dome. In some sketches he com- pared its section and lighting system to the dome of Hagia Sophia. Celestial con- notations were reinforced when he intro- duced the idea of a single beam of light to descend from a hole in the top of the fun- nel and hit the Speaker's area within, at the time of Parliament's opening. This was to remind man that he is "a son of the sun" and to invoke the controlling rhythms of nature in the affairs of man. As to the source, it was surely the Pan- theon (figure 6). And just as the Pantheon implied a microcosm linked to the plan- ets, so Le Corbusier's assembly chamber was supposed to be a miniature world within a world. In this way various images and meanings were compressed into a single symbolic form and linked to an in- stitutional and cultural interpretation of the idea of a Parliament. A similar analogical procedure of transfor- mation is sensed in the design of the top of the funnel with its tilted plaque, its up- turned crescent and its counterpart, downward-turning curves (figure 7). To enliven the form and make it address the setting more dramatically, Le Corbusier tilted the funnel slightly. But there was still the problem of having the shape meet the sky. Le Corbusier let it be known that he wanted the top to be equipped for "the play of lights" and that he was think- ing of it as a sort of observatory; this suggests, and the form reinforces the suggestion, that he may have been in- spired by the extraordinary sculptural shapes of the astrological ramps and plat- forms of the Jantar Mantar (figure 8) in Delhi (or perhaps the equivalent at Jaipur). Planetary, crescent paths can be found traced in stone in these prototypes, and the artist's doodles and designs for reliefs and enamels indicate that he was fascinated by the contrasting flatnesses of curvature between the sun's path at the equinox and at the solstice (figure 9). The upturned curve, of course, was a variant on the Governor's Palace crescent, and probably bore its multiple loads of associ- ation, but could also be read as an arma- ture for carrying the planetary realm. An intriguing analogy is also suggested by some of Le Corbusier's sketchbook doo- dles where he returns time and again to the image of an oxcart wheel with a cres- cent shaped chassis (figure 10). Undoubt- edly the shape was deeply pleasing to him on its own, but perhaps, like the horns of the bull, it was a metaphor for the long traditions and slowly evolving technologies of India? I suggest that a number of overlapping concerns may have been combined-the slow turning of the wheel, the rotation of the seasons and the planets, the unfolding cycles of hu- man life. Perhaps this was the artist's conception of the fate of man, charted through institutional and moral choices, yet embedded in a cosmic design? As with the parasol, the wheel was an image of complex political and theological meaning in Indian tradition. I IL William J. R. Curtis 187</page><page sequence="8">William J. R.

R. Curtis 190 Whatever the precise intentions (and here more research needs to be done) it seems clear enough that the artist's creative method involved the matching of certain pre-forms in his style with phenomena of the outside world, be they in nature or in cultural tradition (figure 11). Through ab- straction multiple readings became possi- ble in a sort of hieroglyphic language. Even the entire plans of buildings could embody a multiplicity of ideas. The Parlia- ment's overall organization was a variant on a type-form combining portico, pro- cessional route, centralized domical space and fringe of secondary functions. The model of Schinkel's Altes Museum has been suggested and this seems feasible so long as it is not assumed that the ex- ample was imitated directly (figure 12). Probably it is more correct to say that Le Corbusier grasped a hierarchical order suggested by the program which made the portico/dome formula a relevant ty- pological tradition. But he would not have sensed this continuity if he had not ap- proached the institution in a particular way. Just as the acropolis as a whole may be read as an idealization of the balance of powers, so the Parliament plan may be interpreted as an ideogram of the demo- cratic process. The two chambers enter a sort of spatial debate within an egalitarian forum of equal sized supports fringed by a smaller scale bureaucracy and linked to the public plaza by the generous portico which, as in the Altes Museum, may per- haps be read as a descendant of a stoa. The portico/dome idea was thus rein- terpreted through spatial conceptions de- scending from Cubism and in a language of elements based on the potentials of re- inforced concrete. It is never quite satisfactory to isolate a single element in an architectural arrangement from its total thought- complex, unless this may serve the pur- pose of heightening an architect's overall strategy. The portico of the Parliament demonstrates Le Corbusier's general in- tention of blending together lessons from East and West in a suitable rhetorical form for the main facade. Where the su- perficial revivalist might have attempted a literal transposition, Le Corbusier tried to probe certain generating ideas and func- tional necessities of porticoes. His piers were scarcely Classical in character, but they did supply a sort of grand order for the building's frontispiece, and did supply Similarly his "entablature" had no direct Classical allusion, but it did nonetheless have an anthropomorphic character from which, arguably, Classicism in the first in- stance sprang. In turn the element pro- vided shelter and shade while acting as a gutter, and harmonizing with the crescent leitmotif. The shape was well suited to gesture toward the setting, while, seen head on, it floated as a stable horizontal above undercrofts of shadow. From this vantage point the building took on the character of an audience chamber of the type the architect may have seen in the Red Fort in Delhi or at Agra (figure 13). Such state chambers were defined by grids of supports open at the edges for cross ventilation and shaded from sun and rain by deep overhangs. Le Corbusier's solution responded to the same issues of formality, ventilation and shelter, but in his own terminology. He bridged the gap between East and West, ancient and modern, by drawing close to the generating principles of past form lan- guages. In the process he touched on cer- tain deep correspondences between the Western Classical language and the architectural grammar underlying both Moslem and earlier architectural traditions. 3 Louis Kahn's Parliament Building at Dacca, Bangladesh (1962-70) is also ar- chaic in character. The building dominates its setting by standing on a raised plat- form as a sort of fortified citadel (figure 14). There is no doubt that it is the domi- nant element of the body politic, because it stands at the culmination of a major axis with the "feet" of the Secretariat at the other, lower end. In turn the an- thropomorphic image of the city of pow- ers is enhanced by the extending "arms" of the various hostels in an array of diag- onal buildings growing away from the Parliament. The offices and supporting functions jostle around the main space of the building in oblongs and cylinders which mediate geometrically between the centric, inward-turning chamber of the as- sembly, and the diamond format of the perimeter. The same geometrical motifs used throughout the complex are inten- sified and magnified in the Parliament building itself. A rich variation is achieved where the mosque breaks free from the a strong directionality while mediating between walls, brises-soleil and columns. governing geometry as it inflects toward Mecca. The primary axis of the scheme as William J. R. Curtis 190</page><page sequence="11">William J. R. Curtis 191 a whole links the Parliament to its setting over platforms and changes of level, but the axis of the assembly chamber itself is switched through 90 degrees. The volumes projecting above the plan carry the intentions into a robust sculp- tural expression responsive to light and shade. The rough brick and concrete ma- terials made sense in terms of local geo- graphical and labor conditions, but also matched the artist's intentions of creating a building of ancient character. The vast cylinders and oblongs are punctuated by enormous voids that create shaded and well ventilated areas. If Le Corbusier's conception for coping with climate was a parasol, Kahn's was a protective layer of secondary spaces around the main cham- ber. This was also a way of registerir)g a functional distinction between member's offices, press-rooms, (the "servant" areas) and the main "served" assembly. In Kahn's mind, no doubt, the gaunt and weathered cylinders, and complex spatial transitions recalled the Roman Baths he so admired: This was the cult of the ruin, brought in to endorse an archaic vision of monumentality (figure 15). Classical inspirations were so embedded in Kahn's mind that it becomes difficult to single out particular sources. The Dacca Parliament is a case of a building issuing from a family of forms with roots in a number of different phases of the past. The anthropomorphism of the capitol as a whole, the suggestion of a body with a central spine and extending arms, may be seen as a long range reinterpretation of a schematic attitude descending from Palladio's grandest villa ideas with their centralized structures at the peak of a hi- erarchy, their wings and their judicious use of axes. There can be little doubt that Kahn particularly revered one major de- scendant of this type, namely Jefferson's University of Virginia, a complex he seems to have admired for its clear hier- archy, its variations of function and mean- ing within a common system, and its reinterpretation of the Pantheon at the "head" of the scheme. Kahn's instinct for bold and sublime geometries was nur- tured by Piranesi's reconstructions of an- tiquity, while his feeling for abstraction was reinforced by those most stripped of Neo-classicists, Boull6e and Ledoux. The planning strategy which sought distinc- tions between served and serving areas descended from Guadet's Beaux-Art theo- ries, "surfaces utiles" and "circulation", and perhaps from particular examples like Garnier's Paris Opera of 1864 (figure 16). It is interesting to compare the plan of this building to that of Dacca (figure 17). There is a strong affinity in the cere- monial use of space, in the variation of structural density and the use of circular and nichelike areas, and even in the way that the mosque is articulated, recalling loosely the "deviant" circular ramps to one side of the Opera. Finally, of course, Kahn's vision of Classicism was enhanced by Vers une architecture an anti-Beaux- Arts tract, which attempted to probe the underlying plastic values of antiquity and which contrasted the giant brick surfaces of the Baths and the Pantheon with the late baroque "horrors" of decadent Rome. If these inspirations were present in Kahn's architectural system, they were thoroughly absorbed long before he went to Bangladesh. But like Le Corbusier, Kahn was also ready and willing to learn from Eastern architectural traditions on the Indian subcontinent. There is little hard evidence concerning his travels or his specific enthusiasms, but Kahn was concerned to avoid creating an entirely Western import. On the basis of his nu- merous studies for Dacca, one guesses that the integration of gardens, water troughs, processional ways and mandala- like plans in Mogul garden design may have made a deep impression. Moreover, where Le Corbusier's concrete skeleton system of architecture allied itself natu- rally with the post-and-lintel construction of Fathepur Sikri, Kahn's penchant for solid masonry cut into by figural open- ings, for centralized geometries and for axial planning must surely have drawn him to the central tomb structures on platforms close to Delhi and Agra (e.g. the tomb of Hummayum or the Taj Mahal). Islamic tomb buildings (figure 18) made a virtual obsession out of the elegant recon- ciliation of circular, polygonal and square geometries, and one guesses that such lessons were not lost on Kahn. I suspect that he knew the Jantar Mantar (figure 19), especially as the Court of Ablutions preceding the mosque at Dacca seems al- most to have been lifted straight from that source, while the President's Platform has an uncanny resemblance to the vast stepped platform preceding the frontis- piece of the Jami Masjid in Delhi. But Kahn's grasp of buildings he admired went far deeper than particular elements or surface effects. The Mogul tradition held out numerous brilliant examples in 191 William J. R.

Kahn (New York: Braziller, 1962) p. 115. the handling of primary and secondary axes, level changes, diagonal perceptions of structure, and the linking of one formal theme to another. What Hindu temple complexes he may have known is uncer- tain, but in any of the monumental com- plexes of India, Kahn could have sensed an animating character, a material expres- sion of the world of the spirit, in accord with his own search for fundamentals. Whether the particular inspirations for his centralized form belonged more to East- ern or to Western traditions is not clear. The fact is that he found common de- nominators between the two. But his pre- existing obsessions, and his formal schemata, naturally led him to seek out different underlying correspondences than those which had attracted Le Corbusier. What stopped Kahn from merely produc- ing a skin-deep Orientalism, or an over- blown formalism, was the foundation of an underlying philosophy and a set of symbolic forms linked to the idealization of the social order. He believed it was a primary task of the architect to under- stand the nature of the institution requir- ing a building. This was an issue he handled with considerable mysticism and some obfuscation, for basically he felt that forms of social grouping stemmed from a limited number of archetypes. It was the job of a designer to see beyond the surface of a building program to this deeper identity and then to intuit an ap- propriate generating "idea" (which he re- ferred to Neo-Platonically as its "form") before proceeding to the full realization of the idea in visual arrangement (the stage that he called "design"). Kahn's primitiv- ism involved the conceit of a sort of first building for each type of institution. That is why it is good to go back to the beginning because the begin- ning of any established activity of man is its most wonderful moment. For in it lies all its spirit and re- sourcefulness from which we must constantly draw our inspirations of present needs.4 The search for an appropriate symbolic form for the institution "parliament" emerges if one examines Kahn's doodles and sketches. Evidently he conceived of a parliament as a sort of centralized assem- bly seeking a unified course of action. In fact this made it a close relative of syna- gogues and religious spaces in his own private typology of forms. But while the circle was the idealized shape of this sort of assembly, the actualities of parliamen- tary debate were best handled by a vari- ant on an amphitheater. The slightly uncomfortable relationship of the two shapes is sensed in the plan and illus- trates perfectly the tension between an idealized type (the "form") and its actual realization (the "design") whose role is "to adjust to the circumstantial."5 Kahn's method of design emphasizes to an extreme what tends to happen in most design processes: An architect's pre- existing solutions and style influence greatly the way a new problem is con- ceived and solved. Time and again in his buildings and schemes, Kahn resorted to square, diamond or circular forms in plan. Time and again he emphasized the dis- tinction between served and serving areas. Time and again he sought to articu- late the separation of private rooms from public spaces-the latter often expressed as atria or covered courts of assembly. Essentially, the Kahnian "genotype" was a centralized space surrounded by a fringe of smaller spaces embedded in a thick- ened structure, and entered on a corner or a symmetrically placed axis. Not sur- prisingly, the Parliament was a sort of ul- timate expression of this formula. While it may be possible to trace the roots of this arrangement to various precedents which mattered to the architect (e.g. the Unity Temple by Wright or various ideal schemes by Boullee), this does not ex- plain the impulses in Kahn's mind that were so satisfied by the shape. Evidently squares, diamonds and circles were so many private cyphers to him: The sym- metrical, centralized form was a person- alized mandala of a kind. This is why the sketches are so revealing, for they suggest the way in which Kahn sought to bring into equilibrium his own psychic impulses toward an intuitive har- mony, with the symbolic demands of a major state building. Like Le Corbusier, he possessed a language of symbolic forms pregnant with expressive possibilities yet rooted in certain deeply engrained ideals concerning the integration of society with the natural order. His private mandala was able to resonate with a long tradition of centralized symbolism for state build- ings. Abstraction became the device through which a virtual archetype was un- earthed, awakened and revitalized. His Parliament was an image of wholeness and balance, a theater of the world, a metaphorical wheel with its axis in the William J. R. Curtis 193</page><page sequence="14">William J. R.

By these means, the buildings achieved their pro- digious authenticity. 4 This essay began with some observations about the distortions of recent propa- ganda, especially with regard to the role of precedent in modern design. It should be clear that the reorientation of architec- ture and the other arts which began to- ward the beginning of this century implied less a rejection of the past than a profoundly new reorientation toward it in- volving a far greater degree of abstrac- tion. At its worst this degenerated into banal reductivism; at its best it allowed, and continues to allow, a sort of expres- sive compression and a research in sensibility into the very basis of the architectural languages of the past. The outstanding works of the modern tradi- tion-among them the two discussed here- have been rooted in this transfor- mation and have rested on new percep- tions of age-old lessons. They recall Palladio's claim for Bramante-that he did not copy the ancients, but understood their spirit and their motivating principles. Alongside buildings of the expressive power and depth of meaning of Le Corbusier's and Kahn's Parliaments, the revivalist exercises that have had so much press coverage in recent years seem flimsy indeed. They remind one that a weak revival is really no more interest- ing, in the long run, than a weak continua- tion of a pre-existing norm. Stylistic clothing matters very little if it does not contain a substantial body. The architect of the moment who seeks a present in the past, or a past in the pres- ent, had better seek an alliance with the outstanding works of the modern tradi- tion. For, as well as giving hints relevant to the technologies and societies of the modern world, these buildings also pro- vide links to the vital springs of tradition. If such lessons are to bear a worthwhile fruit, the artist must possess an authentic style, encapsulating a mythical view of society, a formal system appropriate to the guiding idea, and an intuitive sense of order in both tradition and nature: This much was known before the first pyra- mids were even conceived. 194 William J.
