To reconstruct is to collaborate with time gone by, penetrating or modifying its spirit, and carrying it toward a longer future.2 In the twenty-fifth year of the exile in Babylon God brings Ezekiel to a high mountain in the land of Israel and hands him off to a "man" prepared to show him a newly restored temple. The reader accompanies Ezekiel on an elaborate and detailed guided tour, stepping off the page as it were, seeing what Ezekiel sees, traversing open spaces, entering gates, calculating their width and depth, and measuring—measuring over and over. Numbers of cubits accumulate. We climb stairs, cross chambers, gaze at palm trees painted on walls, pant at the exertion, and perhaps stoop to climb a winding stair. We will even witness a longed for event: the return of God's glory through the gate facing east into the inner court in which God will dwell (Ezek 43:4). The vision in Ezekiel 40-48 is strangely exhilarating —dramatic, densely detailed, concrete, and visual. We are not just listening to or reading about a description of a building but are asked to observe a body, that of the prophet, as it moves through that building. He enacts what he longs to have happen — a return to God's "House" while we become eyewitnesses to that rebuilt house. Not only that, but we will also be privy to the arrangements in the land upon the exiles' return. We observe the chambers for the priests and note at which gate the people may * I would like to thank the following for their comments on earlier drafts of this essay: Alan Cooper, Arnold Eisen, Edward Greenstein, Amy Kalmanofsky, Sarah Luria, Baruch Schwartz, Ben Sommer, Nancy Wiener, the Women's Biblical Research Group and the members of the Columbia University Seminar on the Hebrew Bible.

We learn of the ruler whose dwelling must be at a greater distance from the temple than hitherto and of the tribal allotments of land at the center of which will be the restored temple. Before the visionary experience even begins, God wants to ensure that Ezekiel will recount it and commands him: "Tell all that you see to the house of Israel" (Ezek 40:4). In chapter 43:10-11 God repeats the command and instructs Ezekiel to tell the "house of Israel" about the "House" and its details in such a way as to lead to their repentance. The stakes are very high (as evidence, God appears to be instructing the prophet in a hurry while under enormous pressure. The wording of the instructions is repetitious and different topics are jumbled together). Shame must inspire a collective remorse that becomes a prerequisite to the restoration of the house of Israel in the land: You, ο mortal, tell the house of Israel about the House and let them be ashamed of their transgressions and measure its layout. And if they are ashamed of all that they did—the form of the house and its layout and its exits and entrances and all its forms and all its laws and all its forms and all its instructions make known to them and write it before their eyes and they shall observe all its forms and all its laws and do them. (Ezek 43:10-11 [italics added]). It is clear that the house of Israel must do more than passively listen to the prophet's vision. Ezekiel aims to capture the exilic community's active attention and engagement, to ensure that they respond to his tour by reinvigorating and deepening their dedication to a restoration of the people Israel (e.g., Ezek 44:19; 45:6, 8; 46:3, 9; 47:13-23), its priests (42:13; 44-45), and its temple in the promised land as quickly as possible.3 3 Thus in this reading the prophetic description of the temple is not simply an opportunity for nostalgia over a quickly disappearing past—a rhetorical tour de force that commemorates the former glories of the Jerusalem temple. Nor is it only an abstract vision for a distant future, a valorization of a temple that is wholly theoretical as the community resigns itself to an exile of undefined length. It can certainly be understood as both. Chapters 40 48 commemorate the loss of the temple and offer a vision for the future. But neither proposal captures, or accounts for, the compelling nature of the prophet's vision with its striking sense of immediacy. There have been numerous attempts to categorize the temple vision. Among them see Jon Levenson. Theology of the Program of Restoration of Ezekiel 40^t8 (Missoula, Mont.: Scholars, 1976), who strikes a balance between the mythic and the practical in his reading of the vision (161). Levenson argues that the end of the prophecy should be understood "in the light of mythic concepts of a cosmic mountain" and he highlights the common fund of ideas and images connected not only to Eden but also to Zion that contextualize and give meaning to Ezekiel's temple (17). That said, he goes on to strike a balance between the more theoretical or mythic readings of the temple vision and a more practical program. Levenson writes: "Still we must register a protest. The highly specific nature of the description of the temple, its liturgy and community bespeaks a practical program, not a vision of pure grace. . . . The fact that God has already constructed the temple does not mean that man has no role in its construction. . . . The heavenly archetype and its human execution are not at odds in the mind of the prophet ... the order defined by the vision is still a goal to be effected through human striving and was understood as such by the tradition" (45-46). Jonathan Z. Smith begins his sustained analysis of Ezekiel's temple by identifying hierarchies of power and of status that are reinforced in the details of the vision in his work in To Take Place (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987). He goes</page><page sequence="3">ADRIANE LEVEEN 387 I will argue in this essay that the prophet's vision of the temple is itself a response to the dilemma in which Ezekiel finds himself and his community.4 As a stranger in a strange land, Ezekiel must wrestle with a crisis of a different order than that of his prophetic and priestly predecessors. In particular, I will argue that the very condition that provokes this crisis—Babylonian exile—leads to Ezekiel's visionary solution. I set the stage for such a reading by identifying two challenges created by exile that are taken up in the prophecy and solved in the temple vision at its end. First, exile causes the bodies of the prophet and of the community to be uprooted and displaced from the promised land. Ezekiel's dramatic enactment of the return of his body to its proper place in that restored temple logically emerges from a preoccupation with using his body to enact the intolerable situation of being uprooted in the first place.5 Secondly, the prophet and the exilic community find themselves in an unfamiliar setting littered with monumental buildings not their own. The grand structures of Babylon reinforce Ezekiel's original preoccupation, as a priest and as an exile, with God's house. These particular dimensions of the Babylonian exile best account for the content of the prophecy in chapters 40-48. Bodies are returned to their proper places in a land at whose center is a restored building—God's temple—that they can again call their own. Thus does the book end with a grand and climactic solution to the dilemma with which it began. But his task does not end there. If such an outcome is impossible in the time of the prophet, then Ezekiel's vision of the rebuilt temple must be preserved and treasured in the next generation and the next until the exilic community is granted the means to return. The temple and its environs must stand before each generation fresh in all its concreteness, its details, and its measurements, perhaps ever more so as memories of an actual temple fade. After all, God instructs the prophet to write it all down. Thus, in the end, the "house of Israel" whom the prophet hopes to move is comprised of multiple generations—not only the community alive in Babylon during the time of the prophet but also subsequent generations who on to argue that the temple is a "social map rather than artifacts of mortar and stone" (48) and that the "established structures of relationships that were capable of being both replicated and rectified within the temple complex could also be replicated without. Even lacking a king or temple, or (as later) even without the realistic hope of a restored kingship or temple, the system of status could be transferred" (73). In this essay, in contrast to Smith but in agreement with Levenson's more balanced approach, I am not interested in the temple exclusively as an abstraction, which of course became its later fate, but in the tangible, concrete promise its restoration held out to an exilic community in the aftermath of its first destruction. Ezekiel's prophecy is part of a priestly project whose repeated and urgent aim throughout the priestly texts is to restore a living community to the promised land. 4 This is true whether or not the prophet wrote the vision or if it was attached to an earlier collection of Ezekiel's prophesies by a later hand. The content of the vision responded to and was influenced by the experience in Babylon in the ways I discuss in this essay. 5 The many references of the prophet to the divine body is beyond the scope of this article, though it is interesting that both the human and the divine bodies are so richly relied upon to depict and resolve the challenges and dislocations of exile. For a discussion of God's corporeality in Ezekiel see Rimmon Kasher, "Anthropomorphism, Holiness and Cult: A New Look at Ezekiel 4CM18," ZAW 110 (1998) 192-208, at 192.</page><page sequence="4">388 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW inherit a written text—those in exile, including the priests who might some day resume their tasks, and those returnees who will return to the land and witness the rebuilding of the temple. Of course the vision survived the destruction of a second temple as well as another dispersion and exile many years later while preserving its vivid and compelling sense of immediacy until this day. I shall begin with a consideration of the landscape of monumental structures in Babylon followed by an examination of the ways in which the prophet uses his body in exile. I will then turn to an extended and close reading of the temple vision itself (Ezekiel 40-48). I will pay particular attention to the literary features of Ezekiel's vision as it invites each generation to observe the prophet as he enters the gates of the temple and reunites body and building in the right place. s Monumental Structures in Babylon Other scholars have identified the influence of the Babylonian exile on the language, literary phrases, and visual imagery found in Ezekiel's prophecy.6 In this essay I shall refer only to what is most pertinent to the solution offered by a vision of the restored temple—the exilic background out of which much of the prophecy emerges. Babylon was already a very old civilization at the time of the prophet's arrival. Strangers in a strange land, the exiles would have encountered a physical setting crowded with the monumental structures of the Babylonian past. Its residents, even in 590 B.C.E., would have had access to temples considered quite ancient. According to Jean Bottero: This status of the temples, and their importance in the life of the land, caused them to be given —as if to personify them —"names" that were significant 6 On the influence of the exilic setting on Ezekiel's language, see Stephen Garfinkel, "Of Thistles and Thorns: A New Approach to Ezekiel II 6," VT 37 (1987) 421-37, at 437. Garfinkle has shown how certain combinations of words used in Ezekiel's prophecy are best understood when looked at in light of Akkadian incantation material. One such example can be found in Ezek 2:6: . . because thistles and thorns are with you, and you sit among 'scorpions'" (as translated by Garfinkle, following the MT). Garfinkle argues that certain acts performed by Ezekiel, such as a self-imposed period of muteness and being bound by cords, can also be traced to Akkadian incantation texts or perhaps to a popular poem, the Ludlul, whose topics include "paralysis, binding of various body parts and inability to speak." Stephen Garfinkel, "Another Model for Ezekiel's Abnormalities," JNES 19 (1989) 39-50, at 48. See also Daniel Bodi, who identifies the Erra tablets as another work that Ezekiel could have plausibly encountered. The "Erra tablets [would be] displayed on house walls and doors as amulets against plague and disaster" (158). Bodi points out that the term unique to Ezekiel's vision in ch. 1, is etymologically related to Akkadian elmesu. Other features identified by Bodi that are found in Erra and also appear in the later biblical prophecy include motifs such as the Song of the Sword, the seven executioners, the importance of the figure of the watchman, and in particular, the preoccupation with the departure and absence of the divinity from the divine shrine. Thus, the Babylonian setting and its incantation texts and tablets could have quite plausibly influenced both Ezekiel's language and his physical acts. None of this speaks to the actual lives of the exiles, a topic on which the prophet remains silent.

All are in Sumerian—the custom was therefore ancient . . Bottero reported the counting of at least a thousand such titles.8 Thus those revered buildings were a part of the urban landscape and unavoidable. As described in Gerdien Jonker's work, The Topography of Remembrance, Babylon was littered not just with sacred temples but also with buildings of all sorts in all sorts of conditions: The ruined walls of abandoned habitations as much as the walls of thriving towns, places of worship which were continually being restored and expand ed .. . all formed an ever-present witness to a glorious past. . . . Repairs, reconstructions and respect for earlier builders were the catchwords with which one generation summoned the next to administer their inheritance.9 Already preoccupied with the fate of his temple, in response to a Babylonian landscape littered with ruins and repairs, the prophet might have found further reinforcement and perhaps even some solace in turning his thoughts and memories to his own equally revered, though ruined, structure dating to a much more recent past—his temple, his house of God. In fact, Ezekiel's account of God's return to a restored temple does echo similar accounts, some quite ancient, in the surrounding exilic culture, a point made by Diane Sharon in her comparison of Ezekiel's temple vision to that of a Sumerian hymn commemorating the building of a temple by Gudea, king of Lagash.10 An even more intriguing parallel to Ezekiel's tour of the restored temple can be found in the famous poem, Ludlul bel nemeqi ("I will praise the lord of wisdom"; thought to be composed during the second half of the second millennium) which ends with its protagonist wandering "around in a pious pilgrimage of gratitude" through the many gates of Marduk's major temple in Babylon.11 Furthermore, it is conceivable that distinctions made by Babylonians between Babylon and all other territories could have weighed on the prophet and influenced his thinking, especially since he found himself in one land while longing overwhelmingly for another: What was recognized as "own" was geographically speaking, "here." The "other" conversely had to be situated "far away," behind the mountains, on the other side of the desert, across the river or wherever the symbolic border existed ....

Thus would the prophet's sense of dislocation and longing for Jerusalem and its temple be heightened and reinforced. Thus would he divide the lost land into territories for each of the tribes (Ezek 47:13-23). In sum, I would argue (necessarily in a somewhat speculative fashion) that the particular physical environment of Babylon—with its preoccupation with and valorization of monumental structures and the repair of those structures—might have exerted a powerful influence over Ezekiel and shaped the content of the prophecy's vision of a restored temple. One's god and one's land versus those of others were explicitly marked and set apart. But gods could be restored to their homeland. Such concerns might have shaped and even exacerbated Ezekiel's preoccupation in the prophecy with identifying his "own" building—the temple—in its own space—the promised land. He, too, was greatly aware of the distance "it took to travel to foreign lands" for he did so at least twice in his prophecy! Each time Ezekiel left Babylon in his visions, he reminded the reader of his dislocation in a land in which he did not belong. Those preoccupations took on a further poignancy since the priest who found himself in a foreign land simply could not relinquish the only sacred space, for which his vocation had prepared him—the temple. The resultant text promoted an experience of a tangible, material building meant to exist outside that text, a building in which the priestly class could resume its functions on behalf of God and the people Israel. A Priestly Body in Babylon Yet as long as he remains in Babylon, separated from his temple, Ezekiel takes on the role of prophet. He has no choice in light of the serious challenge to his priestly identity brought about by the temple's destruction. After all, he is of priestly lineage at a time when "the temple [is] destroyed, the sacrificial system brought to an end, and an entire segment of the population relocated outside the territorial jurisdiction of their God."13 Ezekiel remains concerned with witnessing God's presence and tracking God's movements now that the temple has been defiled and destroyed. But at the same time, as suggested by Margaret Odell, "Ezekiel cannot become invested in his role as a priest. ... He cannot be anointed and thereby be 12 Jonker, The Topography of Remembrance, 35, 46. 13 Joseph Blenkinsopp, Ezekiel (Louisville, Ky.: John Knox, 1990) 12. Note, too, Walther Zimmerli's attribution to Ezekiel of a priestly background: "His interest in the temple, his knowledge of sacral ordinances, as well as the closeness of his language to that of the Code of Holiness and the Priestly Document . . . provide sufficient external support for this" (Walther Zimmerli, Ezekiel 1: A Commentary on the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel, Chapters 1-24 [trans. Ronald E. Clements; Hermeneia; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1979] 16).</page><page sequence="7">ADRIANE LEVEEN 391 made holy, because he is in an unclean land. Instead, Ezekiel appears to undergo a counter-initiation, a series of acts whereby he relinquishes his priestly status."14 As a consequence, from very early on, Ezekiel takes on a prophetic role. As a prophet he complements his moves between territories and identities by moving between different kinds of prophetic behavior and forms. These include written rebukes, prophetic oratory, and a lively description of attention-grabbing physical acts. Based upon the description of his physical acts, at least some of them suggest live performances not uncommon to the undertaking of other prophets: "prophetic sign-actions were actual, conscious events, in some cases perhaps derived from ecstatic experience, but later developed into public performances."15 What makes Ezekiel's case particularly interesting is the overwhelming logic of his turn to a performance that makes the body central to its expression considering the shock of observing so many bodies, including his own, settling down in the wrong place, in exile. That logic seems to be confirmed by the sheer number of times he uses the body to convey a message to his audience.16 The prophet uses his body to express his anguish, his rage, and his hope at the turn of events throughout the prophecy. He uses his body to enact the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. He returns to Jerusalem in a vision to serve as an eyewitness to its destruction and God's departure. Further in the prophecy, the prophet conjures up skeletal forms in the famous image of bones that come to be graphically clothed with flesh and skin. In that episode the prophet heralds the return of life to the people Israel in a restored temple. Finally, at prophecy's end Ezekiel's body is summoned once again for a journey back to Jerusalem to confirm the fulfillment of that hope in a tour of the restored temple and to witness God's return to the temple. The use of the body is particularly obvious in the early stages of the prophecy. In these early scenes, example follows example with great rapidity as Ezekiel uses almost every part of his body. In chapters 1-5 images are conjured up of the body being flung down (1:28), of the prophet being set on his feet (2:2), of his being commanded to eat of the scroll (3:2-3), of his face becoming as hard as that of the people, and of his forehead becoming brazen (3:8). He takes God's word to heart as he closely listens with his ears (3:10). His whole body is implicated when God next orders him to "shut yourself in your house" (3:24). He is then ordered to perform a series of acts. Bound with cords, he becomes mute, sets up a siege against Jerusalem, lies on his left and then on his right side, eats bread baked on 14 Margaret S. Odell, "You Are What You Eat: Ezekiel and the Scroll," JBL 117 (199B) 229-48, at 237. 15 Ellen Davis points out that such a description of prophetic activity is based on the work of Georg Fohrer and cites the relevant references at the end of her book.

Zimmerli, Ezekiel 1, 17.</page><page sequence="8">392 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW cow's dung, and shaves and burns his hair. The quantity and duration of his acts draw repeated attention to the body in its displaced and uprooted state. The trauma of exile and the events surrounding that exile are never far from his mind. Nor should the people forget what is happening "there," that is, in Jerusalem. The best way to keep the crisis front and center is not merely to describe it but to re-enact it. Therefore, Ezekiel does not just announce the siege of Jerusalem but acts it out: "And you, ο mortal, take for yourself a brick and put it before you and incise on it a city, Jerusalem. And put up a siege against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast a mound against it..." (Ezek 4:1-2). God announces that the city "shall be under siege,you shall besiege it" (Ezek 4:3b [italics added]). Ezekiel is not only to announce the desperate state of the people but also to enact it by having his food and drink rationed (4:9-11) and by baking bread on cow's dung (4:15). God makes the parallel between the rationing of Ezekiel's food and drink and that of the people in Jerusalem explicit: "I shall break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight, in anxiety, and drink water by measure, in horror." (4:16). Ezekiel's performances are said to have lasted for many days —390 days lying on his left side and 40 days lying on his right (4:5-6).17 Life under a siege of significant duration is thus replicated. In fact, as the suffering of Ezekiel's body gradually worsens, it bears witness to the passage of time. Finally, Ezekiel enacts the end of the siege and its results by cutting his hair and dividing it in thirds: a third to be destroyed by fire, a third by sword, and a third to be scattered to the winds (5:1-2). The concreteness and detail of these gestures is striking. Ezekiel continues to remain preoccupied with the location of his body and that of God as his prophecy unfolds. In fact, his body is restless and on the move, reinforcing the fact that the exiles are not where they belong. For instance, after performing the siege of the city, Ezekiel is taken back to Jerusalem in his visions to be an eyewitness to the temple, its abominations, and to the punishment of its inhabitants in chapters 8-11. It is not enough that Ezekiel enact the punishment of the inhabitants. Now he must return to observe the abominations in the temple that provide the evidence for and the justification of God's departure from the building and the city. He must also testify as an eyewitness that the divine departure occurred. God orders Ezekiel to remember what he sees and to bring back both a description of the temple's desecrated status and of God's promise of a future restoration by granting the exiles a "new spirit" (11:19). Upon his return to Babylon, Ezekiel 17 For a discussion of the numbers and a review of the proposals that attempt to explain their significance, see Moshe Greenberg, Ezekiel 1-20 (New York: Doubleday, 1983) 103-4. Whether or not Ezekiel actually performed the acts attributed to him, we do, in fact, have a modern example of a performance of long duration by the artist Tehching Hsieh who spent a year lying on a cot in self-imposed isolation within a cage that he built in his New York apartment. For details of this performance and others of extended duration, see Adrian Heathfield and Tehching Hsieh, Out of Now, The Lifeworks of Tehching Hsieh (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 2009).

These chapters anticipate and build toward the vision at the end of the prophecy. Thus, the prophet's use of his body falls into two categories—prophetic visions and staged performances — that come together in my reading in the prophet's tour of the restored temple at prophecy's end. The physical performances in chapters 1-5 create a sense of experiential immediacy that, in turn, inform the vision and its effects on the reader in chapters 8-11. Throughout, the prophet's body is fully engaged and is central to the meaning and message of the event. Odell highlights the performative quality of the prophet's behavior when she describes Ezekiel as living out "what is in store for his people. The man was the message; indeed the man became the event."18 A brief consideration of Ezekiel as a performance artist not only accounts for the strong effect of these initial episodes on those who witnessed his actions or later heard of them but also explains the vivid and engaging experience of accompanying Ezekiel as he tours the restored temple in chapters 40-48. Late-twentieth-century performance art provides a useful context in which to consider Ezekiel's dramatic acts since the two bodies of performace share the same kind of method and effecs.19 Physical performance bridges the distance between an artist's creation (painting/sculpture/object) and the observer, allowing the audience "unmediated access."20 The live artist and his/her body becomes the most direct "medium of expression."21 Performance results in "breaking down categories and indicating new directions" by using "live gestures... as a weapon against the conventions of established art."22 Performance art shocks the audience into reassessing their own ideas.23 Whether or not Ezekiel's performances are witnessed live or described at a later date, they share with performance art the use of the body as the "medium of expression" and the ability to discomfort the audience. By using his body in these unconventional gestures, Ezekiel shocks the exilic community, removed from the actual events, into considering those things which they might have managed otherwise to ignore or keep at a distance—the suffering and dislocation of the siege of the Jerusalem, the destruction of the temple, and, most disastrous of all, God's departure from Jerusalem. Thus, Ezekiel's performances can be understood 18 Margaret S. Odell, "You Are What You Eat," 248.

His early performances anticipate, and perhaps even predict, the likelihood of his last visionary performance: the solution to that tragedy. In sum, the colorful and, at times, bizarre emphasis on the body communicates Ezekiel's preoccupation with his own body and the bodies of his exilic audience. What remains at stake for our prophet, seemingly with increasing urgency, is the return of those bodies to their rightful places in the promised land at whose center is a restored temple. Λ The Final Performance: Touring the Temple Having briefly highlighted the ways in which this wonderfully peculiar text was challenged and shaped by the reality of Babylonian exile, I am now in a better position to analyze Ezekiel's tour of the rebuilt temple in all its concrete physicality and graphically abundant detail. The tour is both a response to the conditions of exile and a solution to that reality. Let me begin with a brief consideration of the status of the concluding chapters 40^18 vis-a-vis the rest of the book attributed to the prophet. A consensus exists that portions of chapters 40-48 were written and added to Ezekiel's prophecy at a later time. Nonetheless, those portions remained much in line with the preceding narrative of events and experiences. Jon Levenson described these chapters as the work of a school that "believed itself to be expounding the fulfillment of Ezekiel's promise."24 In like manner, John Collins recently suggested that "a nucleus of it may come from the prophet himself . . . [but] on some matters . . . [it] would seem to fit better in the context of the restoration, some decades after the time of Ezekiel.... It is nonetheless very much in the tradition of Ezekiel and continuous with his interests."25 In his commentary, Moshe Greenberg identified the final chapters with the prophet and argued that "a coherent world of vision is emerging . . . decisively shaped by him, if not the very words of Ezekiel himself."26 Thus, a reasonable conclusion might suggest that the prophecy, including its ending, emerged out of the experiences, oracles, and written record of the prophet, a circle of followers/recorders of his words, and, most likely, a later editor or editors. It is sufficient for my purposes that the anonymous author of these chapters continues to make dramatic use of Ezekiel's body and of the Babylonian setting out of which the prophecy takes shape; he does so in order to enact the final stages of the crisis and to provide a fitting ending for the entire work. The arrangements described in the prophet's vision for the temple, the priests, the ruler, and the people could have served either as a blueprint for a community still in exile but preparing for a future restoration or as a model for rebuilding a society of people who have returned to the land. 24 Jon D.

For example, in the early chapters, Ezekiel enacts the experience of siege, hunger, and dispersion as Jerusalem falls. Chapters 8-11 depict God's departure from Jerusalem. Now, in the concluding chapters of the prophecy, the body returns to a newly rebuilt temple to witness God's return to that temple. The "hand of God"—referred to in Ezekiel 1:3; 3:14, 22; 8:1; 37:1 and 40:1—weaves together these three significant moments in the prophecy.27 Ezekiel witnesses God's presence, returns to the promised land, and then returns again to Babylon and expresses what he sees to the people. Chapter 8 contains language that refers both back to chapter 1 and ahead to chapter 40. The prophet repeats his description of the figure framed in fire (1:27 and 8:2). Chapter 8 opens in a fashion almost identical to that of 40:1. Both state the year, day, and month in which the hand of God takes the prophet back to the city. In Ezekiel 8:10, the prophet is faced with the many abominations of the people in the temple, including fetishes that cover the walls of the temple. Far more acceptable drawings, this time of the cherubs, appear to the prophet in 41:18-20. There are rich and obvious linkages between chapters 1,8-11, and 40-48. In fact, the anonymous author quite explicitly links the different episodes of the prophecy when Ezekiel announces in 43:3: "The vision was like the vision I had seen when I came to destroy the city, the very same vision that I had seen by the Chebar Canal." Most significantly, God's destruction of the city's inhabitants and the divine departure from the city in chapters 8-11 is resolved by God's return to the temple in chapter 43 as well as the return of the house of Israel from their dispersal in exile. The unknown author succeeds in closely drawing upon the earlier prophecy to present the temple vision as a logical and fitting solution to Ezekiel's enactment of the dislocation and trauma of the Babylonian exile. To get us from Babylon to the restored temple the writer carefully crafts both the choice of words and the use of structure. As an example of both, consider the use of ΏΌ (there) just before the vision with which we are concerned. In 39:28 God announces that the people will not be left there, that is, in the nations of their dispersal. The word is then repeated in the very last line of the entire book, 48:35, when the narrator announces that the city shall be called: YHWH is there. The word play on not being left there, in exile, but rather, to have arrived there, in the city of God, reinforces the highly conscious awareness in the text of the need to exchange one place for another and provides a frame for the whole. The vision itself begins in chapter 40 with Ezekiel's return to the land of Israel. I approach the vision by means of a close literary reading attuned to the choice of an astonishingly precise and repetitious lexicon suitable to a building (measurements, 27 On this point, Kasher points out that the phrase opens each of the book's three visions. He lists 1:3, 3:22; 8:1 and 40:1. Kasher, "Anthropomorphism, Holiness and Cult," 203. The phrase also appears in 33:22, the moment when Ezekiel is informed that Jerusalem has fallen, and in 37:1.</page><page sequence="12">396 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW gates, and windows), the use of certain words that impress as purposeful by dint of sheer quantity, several examples of a leitwort, and the deployment of active verbs that reinforce the sense of the prophet on the move. The first four verses notify the audience of Ezekiel's return to the land of Israel while they remain in Babylonian exile: In the twenty-fifth year of our exile at the beginning of the year, the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city had fallen—on that very day—there was upon me the hand of yhwh, who brought me there. And in visions of God He brought me to the land of Israel, and set me down on a very high mountain and on it was [something] like an outline of a city on the south. And he brought me there, and behold a man whose appearance was like the appearance of copper, and a cord of linen in his hand and a measuring rod, standing in the gate. And the man spoke to me: "Mortal, look with your eyes and with your ears, listen, and set your heart to everything I am going to show you—for in order to be shown, you have been brought here—tell all that you see to the house of Israel." (Ezek 40:1-4) Note that in yet another example of the vision's interconnection with the earlier episodes, this passage insists that the prophet's entire body be engaged in the undertaking and be relied upon to record it. The instructions to Ezekiel echo those in chapters 1-5: the eyes, ears and heart must be alert. Just as in chapter 8, Ezekiel is brought back to the city in order to be an eyewitness to God's intentions and activities. The opening of Ezekiel's vision recapitulates what came before while now moving the narrative forward to its conclusion. The first four verses of chapter 40 exemplify the extent to which the entire vision is communicated via densely packed, carefully deployed language. For instance, the writer relies on a well-known device, the leitwort, not once but twice in the first four verses. The significant roots are X"Q and ΠΝ~Ι. Four times we are told that the prophet is being brought back. Seven times Ezekiel is being shown something or sees —the goal of his being brought back.2* In addition, 027, already cited above as creating a frame for the entire vision via its use in 39:28 and 48:35, is now used to create a mini frame in the first three verses of chapter 40. In addition to drawing our attention in verse 1 to the prophet's arrival at the site that will now occupy him and the reader for the remainder of the prophecy, the use of 02? in verse 3 creates a frame that draws our special attention to the content of verse 2. Verse 2 announces precisely where Ezekiel has been brought: the land of Israel. The use of 02? in verse 3 also creates a juxtaposition with the word that immediately follows it—Π3Π (behold)—a word that draws the prophet's attention to his guide. The two words communicate the exchange of 28 A form of the root NO appears in vv. 1, 2, 3, 4. A form of the root ΠίΟ appears in v. 2 as "visions" of God. In v. 3 a man "appears" in front of the prophet with an "appearance" like copper. In v. 4 that man orders the prophet to "see" with his eyes all that the man will "show" him since he was brought there to "see" and then to report on that "seeing!" Thus ΠΧΊ appears four times in v. 4 alone.</page><page sequence="13">ADRIANE LEVEEN 397 places. No longer in exile, the prophet can now pay attention to the guide who is standing in front of him in the land of Israel. The four verses also introduce the prophet (and the reader) to an outline of the city—a Π330 —and to the gate through which the guide will take him into the restored house of God. Together, the demarcation suggested by an outline, drawing our attention to a bounded area, as well as a gate through which one can cross, introduce the main preoccupation of the entire unit—the creation of an alternative setting and an alternative building to those surrounding the exilic community in Babylon. We are now invited to enter this building and tour it alongside the prophet. As the vision unfolds, the writer continues to deploy his precise lexicon in rather abundant, even exaggerated form. The repeated verbs for movement provide a striking example. For instance, Ezekiel describes having been "brought" OXO"1"!, "led out" "led" and "returned" 32H in chapters 4CM4. As noted above, "bringing" appears at least four times in 40:1-4 alone. Throughout these chapters, whenever the guide moves from an entrance into a chamber or exits a chamber and moves into the next, we are told explicitly that he takes Ezekiel with him. He takes Ezekiel into the outer court, leads him to the south path, to the inner court, to the east, to the north, to the great hall, etc. The striking presence of such active verbs suggests the extent to which the prophet is on the move. He must walk through the entire building in front of him rather than just listen to a description of its chambers. These chapters surely continue and amplify Ezekiel's preference for the experiential and the performative that was prominent in the work's earlier chapters, where he enacted the events of exile. He will now enact a possible restoration by means of his body. In fact the tour takes on the quality of a pilgrimage through a sacred space as Ezekiel climbs, enters, crosses, and climbs again. What he sees and experiences, especially the physical quality of the building, is conveyed through a comprehensive attempt to describe each entryway and each passage through which the prophet and the reader must cross. The sense of the real is effectively enhanced through the device of measuring and recording numbers of cubits. Cubits are announced roughly forty times just in chapter 40 alone. The enormous attention to the physical details and measurements of the building draws the reader's attention to the solidity of the building being described. I would suggest that the emphasis on the temple's physical details testifies to the profound influence on our writer of the Babylonian valorization of, and preoccupation with, its own buildings. The prophet is not just referring to a temple but he is focusing, almost obsessively, on each physical aspect of that temple. The gates of the building are an excellent example of the prophet's obsession. After a description of the wall, the guide and Ezekiel cross through a gate. "Gate" is mentioned at least forty times just in chapter 40, sometimes several times in the same verse, as in 40:23: "the gate leading to the inner court, opposite the gate to the north and to the east... measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits." The gate is followed</page><page sequence="14">398 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW by its threshold, a recess of the gate, the inner vestibule of the gate, the vestibule itself, three recesses on either side of the gate, its opening, the distance from the front of the outer gate to the front of the inner vestibule, the steps, more thresholds and openings, windows, doors and door posts, other vestibules and chambers, exits and entrances marking off inner and outer spaces, and side chambers. I offer such excruciating detail to reproduce the effect of such graphic images on the audience and reader. The various facets of this building do nothing less than construct an alternative space to that of exile—one that Ezekiel himself has stepped into and is now moving through. As long as he continues to follow the guide around its many chambers, and as long as we follow him, all of us can inhabit a place that is not Babylon. That includes God as well. At its core, after three chapters of physical description, the meticulously measured house is now ready for the return of God's glory (TQ3) as described in chapter 43. How then is the audience and reader to respond to this written temple? The many gates, thresholds, windows, and doors signify the function of the temple as a liminal space—a space that offers a place, specifically a rebuilt temple, perhaps especially massive in its contours, since it is in direct proportion to the massive instability and uprootedness of the prophet and his audience. It is a building in which they can begin to recover from the crisis and trauma of exile. In that liminal space they can be both sustained and renewed, motivated to return as soon as possible to the land, city, and temple that were the sources of their identity and unity in the past. Indeed, by its very definition, liminality is only a temporary state—a moment in time or bounded space. It cannot be a destination. As such, a liminal space would not be sufficient to the prophet. His audience must not be satisfied in conjuring up a temple, however massive, if it remains mere description, an abstraction. Perhaps the liminal space created by the prophet can be sufficient for the time being. But in the end the house of Israel must cross through a bounded space—and text—to get to the other side. The people must someday enter an actual, restored temple.29 Thus, Ezekiel's vision becomes the very means through which an audience can galvanize itself to plan for the restoration of an actual building in a future time and place. The people of Israel can tentatively shed their exilic selves in preparation for a more permanent return to the land and city in which the temple will again take its place. The road back to the land lies through Ezekiel's blueprint, enacted by carefully and methodically walking through a rebuilt temple by means of the prophet's densely thick description. Ezekiel leads the way but the people must follow. The two fascinating verses in Ezekiel 43:10-11 to which I referred in the introduction to this essay suggest that the plan of the house is designed to transform the people, moving them first to shame and then from shame and, perhaps, despair to a renewed commitment to the temple, a return encouraged by showing them the entrances and exits through which their bodies must cross.30 29 As put to me by Ed Greenstein in a personal communication. 30 A strong case has been made that God acts out of self-interest rather than for the sake of</page><page sequence="15">ADRIANE LEVEEN 399 It should be noted that, thanks to Ezekiel's innovations, this building does not simply recreate the destroyed temple but provides the exilic community with a new and expanded model.31 The temple is not as it was. Perhaps the prophet's innovations might contribute an essential ingredient to the community's recovery from trauma. Not only will the temple be new and improved but so too will the organization of the body politic as a restored community. The vision of the temple, written down by the prophet according to 43:11, is addressed to a body politic that includes the prince (fOEO referred to as Nasi in what follows), the priests, and the people. The vision and the text that preserves that vision become twin gates to a rebuilt society.32 By addressing the prince, the priests, and the people, Ezekiel aims to do nothing less than disrupt traditional social, political, and religious arrangements external to the text that were in place prior to the destruction of the first temple. The prophet's description is no mere literary fiction but a full-fledged call to action, especially for the priests. A reorganized priestly class will take its place as the leaders of a reconstituted community. This reorganized priestly class is explicitly described in the prophecy after the theophany of chapter 43. It becomes quite detailed once God returns to the temple. At that point, priestly preoccupations take over as the writer more obviously promotes a priestly agenda meant to be re established outside the realm of the text, on the other side of the liminal moment. The temple vision shows the way by assigning specific places within the building, the city, and in the land to the Nasi, to the people, and to the priests. It is quite striking that the concern with restoring bodies to their proper land and city is so closely connected in this passage with placing those bodies in their proper places hierarchically and physically once they do indeed return.33 I will now briefly address each in turn. In Ezek 43:7 and 45:7 God insists that the human ruler must keep his house and his holdings at a greater distance than heretofore from God's house. He must be buried at a greater distance from the temple (43:9). On fixed occasions the prince the house of Israel who are beyond repentance. See Baruch J. Schwartz, "Ezekiel's Dim View of Israel's Restoration," in The Book of Ezekiel (ed. Margaret S. Odell and John T. Strong; Atlanta: SBL, 2000) 43- 67, at 65; and Moshe Greenberg, Ezekiel 21-37 (New York: Doubleday, 1997) 738. 31 Ezekiel's dimensions for the new temple could not in reality be implemented. Yet his vision could still act upon his audience. As argued by Sarah Luria in a description of the architecture of Washington, D.C., "The spaces constructed by the texts are as fantastic as they are real, as rhetorical as they are concrete—vanguard environments that seek to change the political world." Capital Speculations (Durham, N.H.: University of New Hampshire Press, 2006) xxv. 32 Thanks to Sarah Luria for this creative insight. Of course, I would not propose an exact date on which the prophecy would have been written and edited into its final version. Nor do I know who preserved it, and most importantly, who had access to that text. What does seem clear to me, however, is that the prophet intended his vision to be known to the entire "house of Israel" and not merely to its elite. 33 On the use of the temple to make dramatic changes in spatial organization that would have political implications, see Kalinda Rose Stevenson, Vision of Transformation (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1996).</page><page sequence="16">400 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW can only enter and exit the house of God when the people do so (46:10). While the prince's role seems to be diminished, those of the priests are elaborated upon at great length. When addressing priestly concerns, Ezekiel emphasizes clearly demarcated holy spaces, attention to acts of purification, measurements of the altar, and various contributions for the priests (e.g., ch. 45). In fact, the priestly vision of these chapters seems to be addressed to an inner-priestly circle since it actively promotes a new priestly hierarchy by establishing the Zadokites over the rest of the Levites.34 This is first announced in 40:45^6 and developed in 43:18-27 and in chapter 44. In chapter 48 there is a summary of the earlier arrangements. Furthermore, just as we have seen the writer use an abundance of detail to communicate a vision of the restored temple, so too does he resort to vivid detail to reinforce his program for a new society supervised by priests. We can visualize the instruments used to slaughter the burnt offerings and sacrifices, the tables on which the sacrificial flesh will be laid, the vestments worn by the priests, and the different chambers in which the singers and priests will gather. The "touch of the real" imposes itself on the reader in these images of priestly bodies properly clothed, fed, and situated. Finally, at the end of Ezekiel's vision the house of Israel is resettled in the promised land. In chapters 47 and 48 Ezekiel refers to boundaries of the entire land and to allotments of territory within it, naming each of the tribes and placing them in a specific area. In so doing, he is substituting the physical location of the house of Israel in its present arrangements in a foreign land—Babylon—with its proper, restored location in the land of Israel. Another priestly work also concludes by replacing a foreign land with a homeland in strikingly similar fashion. The book of Numbers details the allotments of territory and tribal placements in the promised land much as that of Ezekiel. Numbers ends by replacing death in the wilderness with life in a new home in the promised land.35 Now it is up to Ezekiel to make this happen a second time by restoring the house of Israel in the promised land. ■ YHWH is There As we have seen, exile presents a solution to the crisis it has created for Ezekiel. The priest/prophet who responds in his own unique way to the external reality of loss and destruction by a dramatic and memorable use of his body is the same priest/prophet who eventually invites his audience to join their bodies with his and accompany him on a tour of the newly restored temple. In other words, the body of the prophet enacts the exile. Now it will be his body that enacts the restoration 34 For a discussion of the priestly politics involved, see Stephen L. Cook, "Innerbiblical Interpretation in Ezekiel 44 and The History of Israel's Priesthood," JBL 114 (1995) 193-208. 35 The parallels between the endings of Ezekiel and Numbers are quite striking, providing evidence of some type of interaction. For details on the way in which Numbers develops these themes, see my Memory and Tradition in the Book of Numbers (Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. 2008).</page><page sequence="17">ADRIANE LEVEEN 401 in a building that is the logical and fitting solution to exile. After all, the vision of the rebuilt house of God is either conceived in or responds to the context of a Babylonian milieu in which buildings are both revered and rebuilt. Thus, the priest/ prophet seeks his own building,his own temple, and offers that temple to the people as well. They are showered with graphic and vivid detail of that restored temple and asked to shed an exilic identity in preparation for a return to a life organized yet again around a temple run by a new priestly hierarchy in a building that could, perhaps, heal the trauma, dislocation, and divisions of a priest/prophet and the people he guided. And yet the final verse of the prophecy seems to express a tentativeness about the success of the prophecy by means of one last crossing between Babylon and Jerusalem. It does so through the use of there. We have seen that the word is used just before the temple vision as a referent to exile ("I will no longer leave them there " [39:28]) and that the final verse of the prophecy also uses there, this time to describe and rename Jerusalem ("and the name of the city from that day: YHWH is there" [48:35]), thus creating a frame around the entire vision. I would now add that the city's name—YHWH is there—reinforces the continuing preoccupation of the prophet with God's whereabouts, precisely the preoccupation seemingly answered at the beginning of the prophecy when God appears in Babylon but now apparently raised again at the very end of the prophecy. But perhaps most poignantly, calling the city "YHWH is there" also suggests that the prophet seems preoccupied not only with God's location but with his own. The final use of Π0 raises the question of the prophet's location. It appears that he is still in exile—desperately wanting to leave there (Babylon) to arrive there (Jerusalem) but at the same time doubtful of the likelihood of success. "Here" is yet again deferred.36 Nonetheless, either there in exile, or there in the renamed city, the vision of a new temple, with its "touch of the real," and its arrangements for a new life and priestly hierarchy remains ever ready to galvanize a generation to gather itself body and soul and return, renewing its days as of old. 36 Thanks to Ben Sommer for that suggestive phrase in a personal communication.</page></plain_text>
