<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY PHILOSOPHY IN ITALY. IN a posthumous book by F. MeliI there are joined two interesting studies in the history of philosophy. The first discusses the religious and political doctrines of Fausto Socino and their developments in the thought of the seventeenth century, and the second the rationalistic mentality of Spinoza. The two themes are essentially related, for in the religious rationalism of Socino the author recognizes one of the currents of thought that were to meet later in Spinoza's philosophy. The first essay has the merit of greater novelty, because Socinian studies have been neglected up to the present and only touched on indirectly, in their repercussions rather than in their origins. For Meli the historical importance of Fausto Socino lies in the fact that he draws from the religious experience of the Reformation a new conception of religion, clearly affirming the principle that Holy Scripture does not aim at conveying abstract knowledge, a scientific doctrine, but on the contrary, as Galileo confirmed, it aims at increasing in us justice, charity, and the moral sense. "Socino has a very lively sense of the morality of religion and of the religious aspect of morals. God reveals Himself to the pure in heart, and only in them does His word find an effective echo. Or, as Blondel says, with whose anti- intellectual intuitions Socino has much affinity, quiet and well-disposed souls can hearken profitably to a revelation from without. Dogma begins to lose its rigidity, and the intellectualistic interpretation of Holy Scripture disappears with it, before John Locke combats it, with greater clarity, in his essay on the interpretation of the Epistles of St. Paul." This pragmatic motive of Socinian religious thought is assuredly very important, even for its historical repercussions. But by itself it does not explain why the name of Socino and the influence of his thought on the Western mind should be constantly claimed as the precursor of modern rationalism. Pragmatism and rationalism would seem at first sight to be incompatible with one another. On the contrary, in order to explain their agreement, another aspect, no less important, of Socinian thought must be brought into prominence, and that is that the pragmatic premise illustrated above forms the ground of a closely reasoned criticism of traditional Biblical interpretation in which Socinian rationalism can be developed in all its vigour. Thus we find a conjunction of opposite motives, analogous to what we meet in Spinoza's theologico-political tractate. Meli's second essay belongs to the more recent type of Spinozan interpreta- tion which seeks to replace the hypostatic view of "Nature" by a conception that is dynamic and in some measure spiritual. In examining the so-called parallelism of attributes Meli contends that its two terms, thought and objective existence, lie in the same plane. "The error of the critics," he says, "consists in having tried to consider in the same way thought in so far as it is identical with being and thought in so far as it is a reflection on itself. In the first case, thought is simply identical with being, in the second, thought recognizes identity and reproduces it within itself." In other words, thought I F.

It is a just observation and has already been made by others, but the only legitimate conclusion that can be drawn from it is that the introduction of the concept of consciousness into the Ethics of Spinoza tends to crack the rigid substantialism of the begin- ning, and to upset the equilibrium in the economy of the attributes in favour of thought. The dynamism of Leibnitz will later make a breach through that crack. But Meli anticipates too much the history of ideas, assuming that Spinoza had already consciously realized what was only to be the fruit of a protracted working-over of his thought. Thus he not only excludes any ontological interpretation of substance, restricting its nature to the activity of its self-revelation and expression, but he comes finally to make a dialectic unity of the unity of the attributes transcending opposition and distinction. In a short, compact volume, A. Corsano' re-examines the problem of the origins of the philosophy of G. B. Vico. This had already formed the subject of a monograph by Gentile, the aim of which was to determine the speculative position reached by Vico in his earliest writings, the Orazioni inaugurali. Corsano now returns to the same theme, attacking it, however, from a different point of view, that of the relations of Vico's thought with the cultural environ- ment of Naples and the humanistic tradition. The result of his wide and deep researches is to discredit still further the old legend of Vico's total isolation in his historical setting, showing us with what hearty agreement and wide sympathies he participated in the agitated and eventful movement by which Neapolitan culture began to share in the new intellectual life of Europe. The idea of a linear development of his philosophical thought, sprouting spontane- ously out of an antiquated and miscellaneous mass of humanistic learning, is now for the first time revealed as fallacious. Instead there is an obscure and silent labour of mental preparation, without a definite philosophical character, or with a character very different from that which will appear in Vico's more mature work. To begin with, Corsano presents to us a young illuministic Vico, a partisan of the new "libertine" ideas that had just reached Naples from beyond the Alps, and about to be involved in the heresy trials which raged against these literary movements towards the end of the seventeenth century. As if to expiate this youthful enthusiasm for illuminism, Vico took refuge later in the humanistic study of antiquity. From this vast and intensive labour of erudition there emerged gradually into light that habit of mind which had already been forming for some time, and took on a new direction from his humanistic studies and a stronger realistic and historical bent. This conjunction of new and old is of great importance for the understanding and disentangling of the strange medley with which Vico's thought presents us, ranging from audacious innovations to reactionary caution, from a "specula- tive ardour so unbounded that it does not shrink from any of the audacities of the most courageous spirits of the age," to "the attitude of laudator temporis acti, of defender, with an almost quixotic generosity, of an over-ripe and debilitated culture." The progress of Vico's thought consists essentially in the fusion of the two mental themes, and consequently in the elimination of everything in either of them that could not be assimilated by the other, the elimination of whatever was abstract in his early illuminism, and of whatever was extrinsic and ornamental in his humanistic culture. Corsano pays special attention to this second part of the process of simplification and sifting out by which Vico achieves the conquest of rhetorical and jesuitical humanism I A.

Another essay in the history of philosophy that deserves mention is that of A. Garosci on Jean Bodin.I Living in France, his native land, in the sixteenth century, while decisive experiments were being made towards religious and political unification, Bodin was able to draw valuable lessons from them, and his clear rationalistic mind has anticipated their epilogue. While the outcome of the struggles for the unity of the royal power still hung uncertain, he saw clearly what was the point at issue between the contending parties-the principle of absolute monarchic sovereignty. He became the vigorous champion of this principle, and drew up that programme of centralization of government that was later put into practice by the French monarchy of the seventeenth century. His Six livres de la Rdpublique, published in I577, have resemblances to the Florentine writings on politics, in so far as they recognize that all States owe their origin to force and violence, but they differ by emphasizing the separation between the problem of origins and that of the intrinsic justifi- cation of power. The authority of the State does not rest on force although it is derived from it, but on sovereignty, defined as "the absolute and perpetual power of a Republic," whose most striking external manifestation does not lie in the executive and judicial functions, but in the power of giving laws to all the subjects. This is a conception of public right which is distinct from the conventions of private right, like the law of contract: the one is consequent on him who has the sovereignty, and who can therefore put compulsion on all excepting himself; the other is a mutual convention, which implies reciprocal obligations. However, in speaking of absolute sovereignty in the theory and practice of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, one should guard against giving it that meaning of totality to which some more recent historical experiences have accustomed us. In the dawn of the modem age monarchy, however absolute it may claim to be, is in fact considerably limited, whether by antique and tenacious survivals of feudal autonomies, or by the claims of the new indi- vidualism (which finds its most striking expression in the idea of natural right), or by the insufficient practice it has as yet in the power of its authority to penetrate into the web of society. The sense of these limits is very keen in Bodin, and Garosci, in the course of analysing his work, gives ample evidence on this point. Another side of Bodin's publicist activity is concerned with the philosophy of religion, which is chiefly exemplified in the Colloquium heptaplomeres. It is a dialogue, supposed to take place at Venice between the representatives of seven different religions, and it aims at showing how the differences of the seven religions that generate fratricidal conflicts derive from purely human and fictitious factors, obscuring the profoundest sense of religion which is common to all men. The idea of a similar natural religion is widely diffused among the European writers of the sixteenth century. The task of gathering together the differential characteristics in Bodin's conception has been admirably carried through by Garosci, who has shown that, while to the other thinkers of the Renaissance natural religion has an immanentist and pantheistic character, in Bodin it has a strongly marked Hebraic bent. Bodin came of converted Hebrew (marrano) stock, and kept alive in his heart the worship of a transcendent God, and the God of his natural religion is the actual God of the Hebrews, but the conception has passed through the filter of a philosophy that has I A.

This also serves to explain Bodin's particular antipathy for the dogmas of the Trinity, the incarnation and the redemption. GUIDO DE RUGGIERO. (Translated from the Italian by CONSTANCE M. ALLEN.) PHILOSOPHY IN RUSSIA. IN U.S.S.R. dialectical materialism is still the only subject discussed by writers on philosophy. Philosophical publications during the last year include Lenin's Philosophical Note-books; Dialectical Materialism and the Theory of Balance, by Selektor; Marx's Philosophical Development, by Lipendin; A Course of Dialectical Materialism, by Markuse; Dialectical Materialism and Social Democracy, by Rudash; The Idealistic Dialectic of Hegel and the Materialist Dialectic of Marx, by L. Axelrod. On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of Marx's death the Communist Academy Institute of Philosophy has published a Symposium containing papers on materialistic dialectics, on the relation of Marxism-Leninism to culture and natural science, and discussion of those papers. A number of small textbooks on dialectical materialism, or Diamat as it is called for short, are issued for university schools not only in Russian but also in some of the languages spoken in the Soviet Union. The only philosophical publications on other subjects are a booklet by Bogdanov, a professor of mathematics, on A ctual Infinity, with reference to Zeno, Newton, and Cantor; D. Zuev-Insarov's Handwriting and Character; a translation of Kuno Fischer's Hegel and of Giordano Bruno's Della Causa, Principio ed Uno. The revival of interest in the Hegelian philosophy after the publication of Engels's Dialectics of Nature in I925 held a hope that Soviet writers might outgrow their materialism and develop some new line of thought. For the last few years, however, they have done nothing but repeat over and over again the stale arguments used by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and even Stalin! The reason for this state of things is obvious to anyone who understands the conditions of life in U.S.S.R.-but this does not help to make Soviet philo- sophical writings more interesting. The utter absence of independent thought, and constant appeals to the authority of Lenin &amp; Co., makes them weary reading. Lenin's Philosophical Note-books, a volume of 472 pages in fine red binding, contains synopses that Lenin wrote of philosophical books he had read, and his comments upon them. Most of the space is devoted to Hegel's Philosophy of History and to his dialectical method, of which Lenin thought very highly. Other parts of Hegel's teaching do not seem to have made much impression on Lenin's mind; thus, he takes Hegel to be defending materialism whenever Hegel speaks of objectivity. The Note-books have no philosophical value whatever but throw some light on Lenin's personality. Apparently the least reference to God made him lose his temper. Thus Hegel remarks apropos of Epicurus that his system is lacking in the conception of a world-purpose, of the wisdom of the Creator; Lenin copies out the remark and writes in the margin, "Sorry for God, are you ? You idealist scum!" Soviet Russia did not send any delegates to the Congress of Philosophy in Prague last September. An article about the Congress appeared in the magazine Under the Banner of Marxism (Nos. 5 and 6). The author, Z. Kalandar says that modern bourgeois philosophy is suffering from "atomization, disruption, 222</page></plain_text>
