<plain_text><page sequence="1">VARIATIONS ON THE THEME OF WAR: NOTES ON A GROUP OF POEMS BY EHRENSTEIN Albert Ehrenstein, born in Vienna in I886, first attained literary celebrity on the publication of his short story Tubutsch (with illustrations by his friend Oskar Kokoschka) in 191 . The eponymous protagonist is a lonely, passive and world- weary anti-hero who moves in a grotesque world, sardonically resigning himself to its inconsequentiality. The feeling of powerlessness and the longing for death which Tubutsch displays were widely identified as belonging to Ehrenstein himself. Yet for a number of years after I911 Ehrenstein was prominent in the avant-garde of German literature, moving in literary circles in Vienna and Berlin and keeping up a flow of poems, short grotesques, essays, reviews and polemics which he published in a wide range of periodicals and newspapers. In discussions of German literary expressionism his name has rarely passed unmentioned. Yet little serious analysis of his work has been undertaken. The only material study of his poems - the part of his work which made the greatest impact, after Tubutsch, in his own day - is a dissertation by J6rg Drews.1 Drews distinguishes a number of periods in Ehrenstein's poetry: one of predominantly subjective lyric writing up to 1913, a second from 1914 to 1917 in which personal poetry is joined by outbreaks of horror or indignation at the war, a third from 1917 to 1919 in which his lyric production is more directly political, and in I920 a return to the personal, unengaged vein, in which Ehrenstein continues for most of the twenties. The war poems we are concerned with here belong to the end of the second period and to the third period. Ehrenstein sets the student of his work many problems by his habit of revising his work from one publication to the next. Few writers can have carried to such lengths the practice of not only stylistically refining already finished and published texts, butjoining two originally separate texts, or splitting up one, or making major additions. After such continual revision and rebuilding, which must have passed Ehrenstein's work through the purifying fire of his criticism a number of times after the original inspiration had died down, one expects to find some poetically valid structure in the final version of any of his poems. Stimme iiber Barbaropa is a suitable example by which to test this thesis: Stimme iiber Barbaropa Du leuchtest, Sonne, dralles Licht, Begriinst das Kahle, Spatzen essen dir schneefr6hlich K6rner, Nur im Menschen warfst du nicht Anker, Er mengt deine Tagessaat 5 Seinem Dunkel, schattender Zwerg.

This is in line with Ehrenstein's liking for the 'Rollen- gedicht', exemplified in Der Hduptling, Christus spricht and other poems. But the 'Rollengedicht', in Ehrenstein, is not definitely distinct from 'Ich-Lyrik', as is evinced by such a poem as Der Ungliickliche. The poem itself opens with a six-line strophe of clear antithetical structure: a sunny atmosphere is evoked with great linguistic virtuosity, but then man is introduced - throwing a shadow into the sunny place and refusing (in a mixed 1 Albert Ehrenstein, Gedichte und Prosa (Neuwied and Berlin, 1961), pp. 158 f.

II9</page><page sequence="3">A Group of Poems by Ehrenstein metaphor) the sun's 'Anker'. The second stanza is likewise antithetical, but the attack on man takes up more of it. The activity of God the Creator is opposed to that of man, the ape, louse or 'Menschtier' - Ehrenstein is strong in animal imagery - whose imitation of God turns by an undefined process into a self- destructive activity, the opposite of creation. Line 13 clearly refers to war on land, in the air and at sea; there are coinages ('gierbiuchig', 'Erdversteck'), but they are no more difficult to understand than 'schneefr6hlich' in the first stanza. The third stanza, like the first, apostrophizes sunlight: but now it is evening. And the idyllic evocation is broken after only one line. 'Dammerung' leads quickly to ideas of darkness and fog. A more opaque neologism appears, 'GraustraBe': perhaps a road to which the quality of greyness is not accidental but substantial. The road is thus anyway opposed to the golden evenings, and in addition fog threatens it and it is encompassed by 'tbernacht', a formulation reminiscent of 'lbermacht'. Then Ehrenstein evokes ideas of a flood which has washed out various means of communication: the bridge and the road, the railway lines and the fords. These means of communication perhaps refer back to the title: the voice speaks of the impossibility of being heard. Line 23 refers back to 'meereinher' in line 13, but can scarcely apply directly to naval warfare: a 'Blutregenmeer' must be the product of a rain of blood from above. The same type of triple compound recurs later in 'Blutflussesflut'.1 The 'Sumpfwasser des Schlafs' is a parallel to the sea of blood; the verbs 'taumeln', 'saumen' express a mental anaesthesia, a dis- orientation of the spirit which cannot see - or even be sure of the existence of- a boundary of the sea of blood. The fourth stanza makes it clear that the night is metaphorical: it lasts years, the years of the war. The voice addresses others for the first time and dissociates itself from responsibility for the battle. The whole stanza is an emotionally charged question (such as occur frequently in Ehrenstein - see Drews, pp. 107 f.). At the beginning of the fifth stanza, as in the incongruous 'tauneln einher', paradox is used: those addressed drown themselves in their own failure, or drying up, or throwing away of victories- 'Versiegen'. Next Ehrenstein evokes the 'Schwarz- schwine': it seems the years of horror and destruction have reversed the generally irreversible whiteness of the swans and made them as substantially black as the 'GraustraBe' is grey. The image probably refers to the topos of the poet as swan (Holderlin's 'heilig-niichtern' swans were certainly known to Ehrenstein). We thus find here another reference to the 'Stimme': the poet's voice has only a dark message to offer, cannot make even this heard and sinks down tired. Such an interpretation of the black swan is corroborated by these lines in a similar context in the poem Schwache: Schwarzflamme des Worts - ohnmachtig wie Efeu! Uhu und Unke wider der Teufel Bluttunke. (Die rote Zeit, 37; Gedichte und Prosa, I54) A third paradox, the opposition of 'still' and 'Himmelhinbriillen', points clearly to its own metaphorical function: one can hear a still pool roaring only if one provides the connexion between 'himmelhinbriillen' and more familiar expressions such as 'himmelschreiend'. This is one of Ehrenstein's typical intensifications of 1 Compounds with 'Blut-' are frequent in Ehrenstein's war poems: see Drews, p. 92. 120</page><page sequence="4">ALFRED D. WHITE common turns of phrase (see Drews, p. 95). The sand too has an open mouth, apparently to drink the blood - again one must reflect on the proverbial absorbency of sand ('im Sande verlaufen') in order to grasp the enormity of what is being presented; or else the sand too is crying out, but in vain. Thus the pus and the sand too' may be, like the poet, vain voices. Next comes the elliptical cry of woe - worthy of an Old Testament prophet - on the motherland. Most poets imagine the motherland crying for her sons in war; but this motherland, more literal, bears only battlefields; the bones are a reminder of the unmentioned sons, and only bones (and the voice which draws attention to them) declare war on war. In the sixth stanza Ehrenstein moves from the dead battlefield to the 'Kriegs- erklarer', the ruler over 'Qualen', who sits before the green 'Gefild' and 'Vor-Hang': either the green of a tablecloth, perhaps associated with peace negotiations ('friedenkrahend'), and the green of restful curtains, is meant - or the green of a nature which has not been called to use as a red battlefield or 'Blutregenmeer'. All humans having disappeared, the final stanza knows only carrion. The eagles are invited down (reminding those who know the words of Jesus of Luke 17, verse 37), but not to eat the carrion, but to attack the demon and so avenge the carrion. The demon is to be connected with the war-declarer: Drews (p. 123) would even specify a social group having responsibility for the war, citing the 'Hurradamonen' in the poem Wien (Gedichte und Prosa, I 76). Throughout the poem Ehrenstein uses clearly definable techniques: paradox, unexpected uses of words; symbolic evocations of desolation, not realistic descrip- tion; apostrophe, exclamation, rhetorical question. The only real appeal in the poem is at the end, to the avenging eagles, as if it were too late to appeal to men. Yet the 'Stimme' asks questions of men, speaks about their works, attempts, by poetic means, to make them oppose war. Strangely, one of the strongest emotive images, that of the black swan on the river of blood, reveals itself upon interpreta- tion as an ironical statement that the poet must remain ununderstood, unheard. It is thus in the face of the realization of his own powerlessness that Ehrenstein attempts, desperately, to rouse men against war. The blackness of the swan, the despair of the poet's sole message, is responsible also for Ehrenstein's abandoning any attempt at beautiful poetry. Many readers today reject the forced tone, the strained paradoxes, the solemn rhetoric. But Ehrenstein means these very things as a demonstration against war. Where the scale of the carnage exceeds what he can present realistically, he must have recourse to symbols as crass as the slaughter itself; where the indifference of the readership makes him fear that pleadings in beautiful or moderate language will be ineffective, ugly and immoderate language is needed. The whole poem has a discernible structure. Each of the first three stanzas opens with a vision of innocent and sunny nature - a vision gradually reduced in force as the symbols of warring mankind take over. From a very general attack on man in the first stanza the poem rises to the picture of war in the second, the disorientation of the third in a space given over to war, of the fourth in a time given over to war. The fifth stanza paints the hopelessness of the whole situation, which is then attribu- ted to the 'Kriegserklirer' who stands outside it; the poem ends with the wish for revenge on him. The poem is also shot through with repeated images: not only sunlight, but birds (sparrows, swans, eagles), the river (the fire-river of divine creation, the blood-river I2I</page><page sequence="5">I22 A Group of Poems by Ehrenstein of man's), and the reduction of man to animal in the second stanza balanced by the anthropomorphic treatment of pools, of the sand, of the motherland in the fifth. It is thus a shock to realize that the poem is a late compilation. The first two stanzas started life as a separate poem Nacht (Die weiJfen Bldtter, 4, ii-iii (February- March 19 I 7)), one of a number of poems by Ehrenstein under the collective heading Neue Gedichte. The text is only slightly different from the final one reproduced above. Three of the Neue Gedichte besides Nacht are anti-war poems: Gottes Tod, Predigt and Zu Hilfe! Each contains motifs which concern us in examining the development of the rest of Stimme iber Barbaropa. The third stanza of Gottes Tod runs: Zeit der eisernen Ameisen, die auf ewig blutenden Gleisen nichtig, vernichtend nichtswarts reisen. Predigt starts in a tone reminiscent of Stefan George: 'Ihr verdient nicht Glanz der Wege, . . .' and ends: Blutschlamm verschluckt die Donnerrohre, die Lander eitern - Modermoore, dies ist die Zeit der Drachenfaule! Zu Hilfe! is worth quoting in full: Was niitzt es, wundzubeten hinfalligen Mund? Wo, wo ist die Urposaune des ehernen Engels, zerdonnernder Schlund ? Wo, wo ist die schweigende Wucht, Gewalthand des Erzschildners, der die Kampfzwerge zerschmeiBt unter dem sieben totenden Rand seines niedersausenden Grimmes ? Noch, noch zerreif3t Myriaden im Blutsumpf stummes Ersticken, gasgiftiger Schwaden. Ihr Geier ohne MaB immer nur HaB und Aas ? In these poems we find the poetic exploitation of the preaching tone, the wish for intervention by a higher power to end the carnage by further destruction, and the images of the rail (Gleisen) in connexion with destruction, of blood and pus permeating the ground, of birds and carrion, all associated in one group of poems; but the rail is here the path to destruction, and the birds around the carrion are vultures and so negative (as shown again by Erde (Gedichte und Prosa, 146)), not yet the positive eagles which will avenge the carrion. The motifs are collected in Die weifien Bldtter (5, i (July 1918)): Stimme gegen Barbaropa O ihr goldenen Abenddammerungen, wo ist die Briicke des Stroms?

The rail is now a destroyed means of communication; the preaching or prophetic tone is made obvious by references to the founders of the great religions (alienated in Ehrenstein's usual manner) and to Ezekiel.1 The intervening higher power is represented by an invasion of beings from the cosmos, a favourite theme of Ehrenstein's even before 1914. The quotation from St Luke connects the eagles with the carrion. A 'GroBk6nig der Qualen' appears but is not yet identified with the 'Kriegserklarer'. The other sections are aper?us, some of their satirical significance now obscure (who was Isidor Cohn?). Stimme gegen Barbaropa has little form, beyond a movement from previous sunlight to future destruction of the whole; its attacks on the war are disparate, some satirical, some symbolic, some biblical, some visionary. The ideas are given form in a poem printed in the Viennese periodical Der Friede (I, 1918, p. 24): Stimme iiber Barbaropa O ihr sonnengoldenen Abende, Dammerung - wo ist die Briicke des Stroms ? Nebel draut Grau-StraBe unter der Ubermacht verschiittete Gleise, verschwemmt die Furten im Uberschwall aller Fluten! 5 Wir taumeln einher im Blutregenmeer, siumen im Sumpfwasser des Schlafs und wissen nicht: Ufer. Wann endet die Nacht euerer Schlacht, Io die Barbaropa, Eurasien durch- donnert Mordjahre lang! ?

Other passages of Ezekiel which may be relevant to the inspiration of the final poem are 35, 8; 37, i-2; and 39, I7- 8. I23</page><page sequence="7">A Group of Poems by Ehrenstein Weh iber das Mutterland, gebart Kampffelder, wo das Gebein ragt - Krieg zu erklaren dem Kriegserklarer. Ihm grint das milde Gefild, des grunen Vor-Hangs samtnes Fluten. 25 In den schallenden Hallen prahlt beim Mahle GroBk6nig der Qualen. Aas, durch die Weiten und Breiten nur Aas! Anschwebt, Adler, stof3t die Klauen 30 kriegsgekrontem, friedenkrahenden Damon ins Gekr6s! This version, almost identical with the third to last stanzas of the final poem, rebuilds the second sentence of Stimme gegen Barbaropa by substituting 'Nebel' for the nonsensical 'Unwegsam', and makes other parts taken over from the prose poem more concise and stronger; lines 9-23 are new. The satirical elements are removed to aid the unity of conception - but so is the invocation of the 'Propheten Gottes', so that the word 'Stimme' in the title is less obviously relevant. The substitu- tion of 'fiber' for 'gegen' in the title also gives greater distance. The quotation from St Luke is dropped for a free variation (which makes interpretation more difficult: the saying of Jesus is apparently a proverb, which Jesus applies to those who will not be saved at the last judgement; applying this to Stimme iiber Barbaropa, one would have to suppose that the evil 'Kriegserklarer' is carrion just as are the victims of the war). Finally, the whole is written out as free verse. The unified argument is basically that of the final poem. But in the process of unification, the possible effect of the poem is narrowed by the removal of the cosmic ending of Stimme gegen Barbaropa: the poem falls between the relatively transitory and immediate effect of satire and the permanent validity of a poem placing war in some context. The disorientation expressed in the poem extends also to the form of the poem. In his collection Den ermordeten Briidern, published early in I919, Ehrenstein altered the poem by placing stanza breaks after lines 8, I2, 23, and 28 and substituting 'Ubernacht' for 'tbermacht'.1 This version, with minor variations, was reprinted a number of times (notably in later editions of the anthology Menschheits- ddmmerung) until replaced by the final version in Ehrenstein's definitive collection Mein Lied (I93I). Here the return to a broader, more cosmic frame of reference by conflating the poem with Nacht leads to difficulties by strengthening the day- night imagery which is only implicit in 'ihr sonnengoldenen Abende' and 'die Nacht / euerer Schlacht'. One is led to expect a new day; but the avenging eagles at the end neither permanently destroy such a hope (as the 'Unsternvolk' would), nor strengthen it; one is left with the impression of a desolation which the revenge merely completes. 1 'Ubernacht' may refer to Ehrenstein's feeling of a lack of any higher authority, God or Nature, over man's doing. Morderin Natur (in the collection Herbst (Berlin 1923)) has the stanza: Ins Leben legt ihr Kuckucksei die Hur Natur, Die Tiere, ihre Waisenkinder, sind ihr fern, Sie hurt ums Leben gerne mit dem Tod, Gleich ferne sind ihr Mick und junger Friihlingsstern. Das Leben giert und hier regiert Die Ubermacht: die Nacht. 124</page><page sequence="8">ALFRED D. WHITE The very fact that Ehrenstein finds it possible to join two poems together so simply leads to critical doubts. Drews takes it as the occasion of an attack on both poems: joining them, he says, is justified only by das beiden Gedichten gemeinsame Thema, die Klage iiber den kriegfuhrenden Menschen, der in beiden Gedichten charakteristische Tonfall von Klage, verzweifelter Anschuldigung und Emporung, und die mangelhafte Geschlossenheit und stilistische Grobmaschigkeit der beiden Gedichte, welche Eigenschaften diese Gedichte mit vielen Gedichten Ehrensteins gemeinsam haben. (p. 19 ) This reaction is understandable but overstated. The progression of motifs in the final poem, though not impeccable, is discernible- whereas the addition of the poem Zu Hilfe!, for instance, to either Nacht or Stimme iiber Barbaropa would have produced no unity. And Ehrenstein's 'stilistische Grobmaschigkeit', if it is a failing, is unavoidable. The art of the poem is to retain a development discreetly hinted at, whilst seeming to dissolve into incoherence; and to hint at the inability of poetry to alter the course of history, whilst yet loudly attacking war. This is the double irony of an art moving on the brink of despair, and it is no more contemptible than any other of the distortions into which artists of all kinds found themselves forced by the overwhelming impact of the first world war. Like Drews, Martini sees the negative aspects, the destruction of poetry, as dominant in Ehrenstein's war-poetry: Aber im Pathos dieses Aufbegehrens und Hassens brach sich die dichterische Stimme... Es sei denn, man sehe in den rhythmisch-sprachlichen Briichen dieser Kriegsdichtung... den gezielten Durchbruch durch das Poetische zur direkten Kundgabe in einer Sprache, deren Gewalt das Gewaltsame ubertonen sollte. (p. 690) Die Zusammenhangstorung, offenbar gezielt weitergetrieben, geht soweit, daB nur die einzelne Verszeile einen Halt in sich bewahrt. (p. 704) These statements are not specifically about Stimme iiber Barbaropa - but this poem is one of the cardinal examples of Ehrenstein's war poetry, and careful examination of its third stanza, which has an elusive but real rhythm and argument, would show Martini's words to be inapplicable here. Ehrenstein had not finished with all those sections of Stimme gegen Barbaropa he did not use in the poem. The quotation from St Luke recurs in the essay Mensch- lichkeit (Den ermordeten Briidern, 15). The section beginning 'Wo sind die Propheten...' reappears, altered, as the second paragraph of the prose poem Die Helfer sind tot (Gedichte und Prosa, 162-3), a ridiculous attack on Moses, John the Baptist and Jesus for not being vegetarians. Ehrenstein's horror of killing knew no bounds; he approves only of the killing of those who cause wars, which the apostrophe to the eagles in Stimme iber Barbaropa hints at. As he comes to state this more directly, so too does he become unable to keep up the ironic stance of this poem, to go on writing in verse whilst commenting on the uselessness of that activity. It is in a prose poem in Den ermordeten Bridern that he writes 'Verflucht unsere, meine eigene zuwartende Feigheit, die noch immer nicht den machtigen Riistungsgaunern und Stahlschelmen das Messer in den Magen stieB'. (Der rote Krieger (Gedichte und Prosa, I65)). Here he still cannot resist flinging ineffective puns at German militarism. But by this time he had in fact entered the political arena, as a signatory of the 'Aufruf der Anti- nationalen Sozialisten-Partei (A.S.P.), Gruppe Deutschland' published in Franz I25</page><page sequence="9">I26 A Group of Poems by Ehrenstein Pfemfert's periodical Die Aktion for I8 November I918. He had been a member of the A.S.P. since 1915. The armistice was his opportunity to move from the world of literature, whose impotence he felt so keenly, into active politics. But he made no mark here; there seems to be no record of his participating in events in Berlin, though he was there from September 1918 to summer 1919. The events leading to the establishment of the moderate Weimar Republic were disillusioning to Ehrenstein, who through Pfemfert had been politically close to Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. In the poem Urteil he turns his back osten- tatiously on politics: the oppressed, it seems to him, do not want to shake off their chains.1 From 1918 on Ehrenstein grew gradually less productive; a major part of his work was making adaptations of Chinese verse, which are works of art in their own right but have remained practically unnoticed. A further political phase after 1928 produced a few satirical poems and, doubtless, the final version of Stimme iber Barbaropa. Ehrenstein emigrated in 1932 to Switzerland and later to New York, where he died in poverty in 1950 ALFRED D. WHIT C/ALFRED D.
