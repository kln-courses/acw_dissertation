<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tom Duddy JOHN CLARE AND THE POETRY OF BIRDS It is no surprise that one of the most recent anthologies of bird poetry, The Poetry of Birds (2009), edited by Simon Armitage and Tim Dee, contains more poems by John Clare than any other poet. Such, indeed, is the strength of Clare's contribution to this particular sub-genre of nature poetry that anthologists have sometimes felt obliged to treat his poems as a significant turning point in the evolution of nature poetry represent- ing a significant breakthrough in terms of realistic attention to detail and a determination to tell the truth precisely as the observer sees it, without recourse to conventional assumptions or stereotypes. Perhaps the most radical acknowledgement of the significance of Clare's naturalism is that expressed by Mike Mockler in the introduction to his illustrated antholo- gy, Flights of Imagination (1982), in which he describes Clare as 'the first nature poet in the true sense', the first English poet 'to present nature pictorially, lovingly, accurately and knowledge ably'. Clare is a true nature poet in the measure that nature prompted him to write 'not about himself or his feelings, but about what he actually saw in the fields and woods around his Northampton home'.1 Clare's poems represent for Mockler such a pivotal development in the history of nature poetry that he is prepared to extrapolate from them a criterion by which he will pass rather harsh judgment on the work of earlier nature poets, including even Wordsworth. Mockler in fact refuses to include anything by Wordsworth in his book. His somewhat summary reasoning is that nature for Wordsworth is an abstract, personified force, and not something that exists wildly independently of the poet, to which the poet finds himself responding observantly and joyfully. In particular, the birds that Wordsworth describes 'exist only as far as they affect the poet or those close to him'. In the case of such well-known bird poems as 'To the Cuckoo', 'The Green Linnet' and 'To a Skylark', the bird in question is no more than 'a starting point for a train of thought or an outpouring of emotion'.2 Mockler's preference is for poems that present birds 'as they are, rather than to use them as symbols to point to some moral about life or human behaviour'.3 It is Clare who shows the way in the realisation of this project of joyful, honest-to-nature observation, and does so in a way that exposes the deficiencies of other 'nature' poets. A rather less radical view of Clare's position in the history of bird poetry is taken by Peggy Munsterberg in her scholarly, long-ranging and considered introduction to the Penguin Book of Bird Poetry (1980). In her introduction she shows the extent to which bird poetry has changed in 60 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4</page><page sequence="2">response to changes in both the wider culture and in the history of poetry itself. More than perhaps any other non-human creature, birds have been the subject of superstition, fable, myth, legend and folklore. Indeed, part of the story of the evolution of bird poetry is its gradual extrication from the cultural tangle of conventional belief and assumption. When birds feature in pre-modern poetry, it is very much as bearers of signs, omens, or other symbolic meanings of one kind or another. Birds in Anglo-Saxon verse are treated for the most part as the means to a symbolic or allegorical end, often of a negative kind. The raven, for example, is nothing if not always ominous, sometimes cast in an auspicious light but more often taken to prefigure death or war. Medieval bird poetry, according to Munsterberg, broke with the earlier traditions of 'omenism' by creating a space for the nightingale and other singing birds. Even where new birds of prey are introduced, they are characterised in a more complex symbolic way, offering a spectrum of meanings that range from the marking of hierarchy (in nature and socie- ty) to the celebration of courtly love. The falcon sits close to the top of a 'natural' hierarchy, like the lordly eagle, but it is also allocated to a more figurative role as the (male) lover who hunts his desired prey. Perhaps Munsterberg's most unexpected observation on the medieval treatment of birds is that there is a new element of realism in the manner in which birds are represented, despite the usually anthropomorphic character of these representations. In the early thirteenth-century poem, The Owl and the Nightingale , for example, though not at all an attempt to treat the named birds in a descriptive manner, there is nonetheless 'a real fusion of the animal and the human'. The poem consists of a lengthy debate between the birds about the relative merits of each other's voices, especially with regard to their effects on the human world, with each bird singing its own praises while finding fault with the supposed virtues of its opponent. The achievement of the anonymous poet is to make the human characters of the birds 'come out of the bird nature',4 in the sense that the steadfastness advised by the owl is grounded in the fact of its all-year residence in its local habitat and also in the fact that it continues to 'sing', even in winter, unlike the more 'flighty' nightingale who opts to spend winter elsewhere. The nightingale's more carefree, light-hearted outlook on life resonates with a natural cycle that is indeed less earth-bound and given to flight in more ways than one. Even as the debating birds try to represent each other's virtues as vices, with reference to physique, 'voice', and manners, they inadvertently succeed in giving moderately realistic characterisations of each other. Of course, the realism here is much qualified by the fact that these talking birds are ultimately no more than fanciful enlargements of human beings. Even in Chaucer's verse, birds are effectively human characters in bird-like guises. POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4 | 6l</page><page sequence="3">In Elizabethan poetry, according to Munsterberg, we find ourselves at an increasing distance from the ominous birds of Old English verse. Here the birds that feature most prominently are the singers or choristers, whose presence in poetry reflects certain developments in the wider culture. Munsterberg suggests that the liveliest bird-song poems were written between the 1580s and the 1620s, 'a period which corresponds to the flowering of the English Madrigal School' . Yet, despite the fact that much Elizabethan bird poetry is constrained by the conventions of traditional pastoral verse, with melodious birds 'singing madrigals to love-sick shepherds',5 it is still possible to claim that it is 'touched with a new naturalism'.6 This is primarily a naturalism of sound or Voice', rather than a naturalism of appearance or behaviour, but it does bring a new realism to the representation and evocation of bird song, and is especially concerned to convey the distinctive sounds made by different species. Touches of Elizabethan realism are to be found most impressively in the work of Michael Drayton, who, while drawing upon the birds of tradition and sometimes reverting to medieval conceptions, also introduces birds that were not part of tradition, and, moreover, sometimes treats them naturalistically rather than conventionally. In one passage in his long topographical poem Poly-Olbion (1612; 1622), he describes the movement of a large flocks of ducks over a fen, and also provides brief glimpses of individual species and specimens, including the mallard, teal, widgeon, and dabchick: The diving dabchick here among the rest you see, / Now up, now down again, that hard it is to prove, / Whether under water most it liveth, or above'.7 Munsterberg argues that the eighteenth century further narrowed the gap between realistic description and the traditional conventions and stereotypes surrounding birds. The poets of the period opted to use only such conventions as came closest to representing or suggesting the birds of nature, and thus they effectively 'trimmed the birds of tradition to more reasonable shapes'.8 An older symbolism was retained but in a scaled-down way, and with recourse to a more naturalistic language of characterisation. The nightingale still features, for example, but without always having to press her breast against a thorn in order to make her singing more doleful - one of the traditional beliefs about the behaviour of the bird. The halcyon no longer magically calms the waves, but simply 'becomes the blue-coloured bird of peaceful summer rivers',9 while the pelican disappears from view altogether, indicative of the recognition that it is not in fact a British bird. At the same time, the lark is moved into a position of prominence, functioning as a model of eighteenth-century simplicity, elegance and modesty of charm. Munsterberg identifies James Thomson's long poem, The Seasons (1730; 1744), as containing the most realistic bird poetry of the period, despite the generally artificial tenor of 62 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4</page><page sequence="4">his language. In several sections of the poem, Thomson writes descriptively about birds, without recourse to conventional beliefs or associations. Munsterberg concludes: Thomson's birds do not stand for anything else. They are themselves, immersed in activities that have nothing to do with man/10 A new ornithological democracy is also in evidence in Thomson's poem. While the nightingale features in the section on spring, so also does a whole chorus of more 'unconventional' birds, including the jay, rook and jackdaw, whose notes, harsh when heard in isolation, Aid the full concert; while the stock-dove breathes / A melancholy murmur through the whole.'11 In the next century, the Romantic poets display a more accurate knowledge of birds, though the real bird is often just the starting point to a flight of poetic reflection or fancifulness. For the realist, the natural object will always be the end point of a description or evocation, but for the Romantic 'it is a beginning, an opening, an entrance to his own expe- rience'.12 This is most obvious in the case of Keats and Shelley. Despite the fact that 'Ode to a Nightingale' is one of Keats's most famous poems, which in turn adds to the fame of the bird itself, the poem is not for the most part about the bird of the title, but rather about the poet's emotional and imaginative response to the bird's presence. Moreover, Keats leans heavily on conventional knowledge of the bird, especially its association with singing of an ethereal, uplifting kind. The same kind of point may be made about Shelley's use of the skylark. Having 'conceded' to the bird that he does not know what sort of being it really is - 'What thou art we know not' - Shelly launches into a series of extravagant similes, the better to pursue the elusive essence of the 'blithe spirit' that is the skylark. From a naturalistic point of view, this only takes him further away from the bird of nature - which does not mean that the resultant verse is without great poetic merit, or that Keats, Shelley and the Romantics did not make a significant contribution to the history of bird poetry In one of her most original and revealing remarks on Romantic bird poetry, Munsterberg claims that in Romantic verse, 'the conventions are so enlarged, so enriched, so deepened, that they are utterly transformed, as if the stereotypes had been projected through a magic lantern'.13 The transformation of stereotypes may produce intriguing poetic effects, but it does not give us naturalistic truth. It is not until we enter the work and the mental world of John Clare (1793-1864) that a new standard of naturalism is reached. Like no other poet before him, Clare cuts through the conventions, symbolisms and associations surrounding and ultimately obscuring birds, and draws entirely on his own experience and close observation, frequently writing about 'new' birds - that is, birds that had not been part of poetic tradition. We soon see that there is a close link between the revelatory clarity and precision of his descriptive POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4 | 63</page><page sequence="5">language and his deliberate departure from the diffuse poetic diction of other nature poets. As Munsterberg puts it, 'Clare saw nature in sharp particulars, and he tried to translate them as exactly as possible into words'.14 He is, however, no passive observer, letting nature get to him, even 'ambush' him, as could be said to be the case with Wordsworth; rather, he searches, hunts, crawls on all fours, the better to see what is happening in the fields, heaths, hedges, woods, and undergrowth. Where the Romantics tended to transform the birds of their inspiration into blithe spirits and birds that never were, Clare simply gives expression to what he so carefully - and so caringly - observes. One significant difference between Clare and the Romantic poets is the frequency with which he writes about the most lowly' element of the bird world, namely, the nest, which he often describes in language that is at once exact and lyrical, as in these lines (which retain the irregular spelling and punctuation of the original) from 'The Thrush's Nest': How true she warped the moss to form her nest And modelled it within with wood and clay And bye and bye like heath bells gilt with dew There lay her shining eggs as bright as flowers Ink-spotted over shells of greeny blue And there I witness in the summer hours A brood of natures minstrels chirp and fly Glad as the sunshine and the laughing sky15 Victorian poetry reveals both Romantic and realistic elements, according to Munsterberg, sometimes merging or compounding them into a moderate middle ground. There are no John Clares in the period, yet an impressive level of realism is maintained. There is a steady erosion of the 'bird traditions'; and the only conventions that remain in place are those that are reasonably realistic, such as the cuckoo standardly hailed as the herald of spring. More and more minor or previously unsung birds begin to have their day in the sun. By the time we get to the modern period, we find a new egalitarianism about birds and an intensification of Victorian individualism in which 'fragmented realistic impressions, often vivid and sharp, are combined with complex personal reactions'.16 While Munsterberg's account of the evolution of British bird poetry is for the most part wonderfully enlightening, it does lean towards a progressivist assumption that is open to question, especially with regard to the 'placing' of John Clare. The progression that is strongly hinted at in her introduction is a progression away from conventionalism and symbolism towards objective realism, with Clare seen not only as a mould-breaker but also as bringing to a head - and ultimately trumping 64 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4</page><page sequence="6">Swift illustration courtesy of Michael O'Clery</page><page sequence="7">Skylark illustration courtesy of Michael O'Clery</page><page sequence="8">Nightingale illustration courtesy of Michael O'Clery</page><page sequence="9">Kestrel illustration courtesy of Michael O'Clery</page><page sequence="10">Cuckoo illustration courtesy of Michael O'Clery</page><page sequence="11">Hummingbird illustration courtesy of Michael O'Clery</page><page sequence="12">Corncrake illustration courtesy of Michael O'Clery</page><page sequence="13">Blackbird illustration courtesy of Michael O'Clery www.birdsireland.com/ oclery.html</page><page sequence="14">- the occasional or incidental gestures towards realism of a small number of earlier poets. His perceived achievement is not only to reject earlier conventional and symbolic treatments of birds, but also to reach a level of realism that has been taken up and moderated by later poets, beginning with the Victorians. It is this suggestion that there has been in English poetry a fitfully emergent impulse towards a realistic bird poetry, which finally came to a head in the work of John Clare, and was subsequently taken in different directions by later poets, that is to some degree questionable. We can readily agree that Clare is a nature poet par excellence , judged by realistic or naturalistic criteria, and that he sets the standard for all subsequent attempts at realistic writing about birds, other animals, and nature in general. I wish to argue, however, that Clare's poetry was not necessarily the revolutionary breakthrough that is suggested by Munsterberg, as if the spell of conventionalism, symbolism and other kinds of associative human thinking around birds was lifted forever - as if, in other words, Clare has had an effective and lasting influence on all subsequent nature poets. My argument will be that, while Clare is indeed a standard bearer for all subsequent nature poets, he is also in an important sense unique or sui generis. I want to begin by dwelling on some of the best bird poems that appeared after Clare's time, beginning with Thomas Hardy's two poems, 'The Darkling Thrush' and The Selfsame Song', Gerard Manley Hopkins's The Windhover', and W В Yeats's The Wild Swans at Coole' - all in the Munsterberg anthology. We should soon see that these poems do not remind us very much of the naturalism of John Clare, despite being very fine bird poems in their own right. Their treatment of birds is sometimes as associative, even as conventional and as symbolic, as that in the work of poets before Clare. Hardy was, by his own admission not particularly interested in nature per se , as is clearly indicated in his remark that 'an object or mark raised or made by man on a scene is worth ten times any such formed by unconscious Nature'.17 While there is no indulgence in conventional or archetypal associations in 'The Darkling Thrush', neither is there an attempt to describe the bird in appreciative and cumulative detail. Hardy assumes that the reader knows very well what a thrush is and how it looks and sounds. The most descriptive terms he uses - 'frail, gaunt, and small' - are sympathetically human ones, rather than strongly objective ones. What matters most to Hardy is the effect of the bird's surprisingly hopeful singing on himself and on anyone else who might care to listen: So little cause for carolings Of such ecstatic sound Was written on terrestrial things Afar or nigh around, POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4 | 65</page><page sequence="15">That I could think there trembled through His happy good-night air Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew And I was unaware.18 In 'The Selfsame Song', the singing bird is not even named - an omission that Clare would not have countenanced - because, again, what matters to Hardy is the fact that the birďs singing prompts a poignant realisation about the perishability of all living things - including the singing bird and its song. Poetically, the bird is a means to an end, not an end in itself: - But it's not the selfsame bird. - No: perished to dust is he . . . As also are those who heard That song with me.19 Hopkins's windhover is not described at all, but is rather conjured up out of mimetic, evocative exhibitions of language that presuppose an existing familiarity with the bird in question, the kestrel. The reader with the best perceptual - indeed, conventional - knowledge of the appearance and flight pattern of the bird is the one best placed to appreciate Hopkins's own flights of language and his figurative condensations and rarefactions. The language is originally expressive rather than originally descriptive, and has more to do with the poeťs perceptions and yearnings than with the bird itself. Moreover, it transpires that the poet is 'using' the bird to give expression to a religious feeling or intuition, and has not been seeking to do descriptive justice to the bird for its own natural sake. In the end, Hopkins abandons the bird, themati- cally speaking, when he realises and invokes the great gap that exists between the brute physical beauty of the bird and the superior, transcen- dent beauty of Christ, his 'chevalier . Poignant contrast between bird world and human world is also the theme of 'The Wild Swans at Coole', in which the seemingly unchanging reality of the birds is meaningfully set over against the changed and changing life of the poet. To the ruefully imaginative mind of the poet, the hearts of the birds have not grown old or weary, or less passionate, since he first heard the 'bell-beat of their wings' over his head nineteen autumns ago. But his own heart in the meantime has grown sore, and he is oppressed by change. Not only are the swans 'exploited' to give expres- sion to a sense of time passing and life changing, but they are also spoken of in exaggerated and idealised terms - to the point, indeed, of paradox. On the one hand, they are partially humanised, insofar as they are seen as lovers, capable of passion and conquest; on the other, they 66 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4</page><page sequence="16">are represented as lying outside or beyond the reach of the irresistible forces that pervade the changeable, mortal human world where the body ages and passion fades. In the case of both Hopkins and Yeats, we have before us some wonderful writing - but it is not wonderful for anything like the same reasons that the writing of John Clare is also wonderful. What is true of Hopkins and Yeats is also true of a number of other twentieth-century poets who have written in earnest - that is to say, more than incidentally - about birds, without achieving the realism of John Clare, namely, Edward Thomas, D H Lawrence, and Ted Hughes. These poets are not represented in the Munsterberg anthology, but they are all well represented in the Armitage and Dee. (While the Armitage and Dee contains work by non-British as well as British and Irish poets, I am going to limit my comments here to the latter, with the exception of a reference at the end to a 'British' poem by Sylvia Plath). Edward Thomas is the only one whose work could be said to show the influence of Clare to any significant extent. The most Clare-like of his poems is 'Birds' Nests', which appears opposite Clare's poem of the same title in the anthology. The particular nest on which the poet dwells is not described as it looks in spring, but as it looks later in the year when it has been exposed and dislodged by autumn winds. The poet then makes an unClare-like admission: Since there's no need of eyes to see them with I cannot help a little shame That I missed most, even at eye's level, till The leaves blew off and made the seeing no game.20 Thomas's most impressive bird poems are those in which he reflects ultimately and poignantly on emotional human realities, as in 'She Dotes'. In this complex poem, a grieving woman sometimes laughs, sometimes cries at the fact that all the birds around her continue to sing and chatter to their hearts' content, despite the fact that her loved one has died. That there is craziness in her grief is suggested by her attempt to persuade herself that the birds are merely chiding her for thinking that death can divide her from her lover: 'And she has slept, trying to translate / The word the cuckoo cries to his mate / Over and over'.21 At an even further remove from Clare's naturalism is 'The Unknown Bird', in which the poet recalls 'three lovely notes' that he heard one summer, soft and far off, as if he or the bird were in a dream: 'As if a cock crowed past the edge of the world'.22 These notes - not known, he claims, to the natural- ists - continue to bring him great lightness of heart whenever he remembers them. It is in poems such as this that Thomas's strengths are most in evidence, and not so much in the more Clare-like 'Birds' Nests'. POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4 ¡ 67</page><page sequence="17">In the bird poems of D H Lawrence - three of which are contained in the Armitage and Dee anthology - we have a return to the enlargement and transformation of stereotypes that Munsterberg imputed to the Romantic poets, albeit with more touches of sublimity and terror than of beauty or charm. In 'Eagle in New Mexico', for example, we find Lawrence drawing upon the ancient belief that the eagle can stare at the sun, hence the references throughout the poem to 'scorched breasť, 'sun-breaster', 'burnt dark feathers', 'feathers still fire-rusteď and 'fiery bird of prey'. The eagle is addressed as fierce and bloodthirsty: 'When you pick the smoky red heart from a rabbit or a light-blooded bird / Do you lift it to the sun, as the Aztec priests used to lift red hearts of men?'23 In the end, Lawrence differs from his Romantic predecessors in refusing to celebrate or sing the praises of his chosen bird, a bird of prey His responsiveness to the darker, more sublime aspects of birds is not confined, however, to birds of prey Even the hummingbird can send the poeťs imagination into a primitively fearful spin: I can imagine, in some otherworld Primeval-dumb, far back In that most awful stillness, that only gasped and hummed, Humming-birds raced down the avenues.24 In a very short time, the poet's imagination has magnified the little bird out of all proportion to its natural dimensions, imagining it to have 'flashed ahead of creation , and even to have been 'a jabbing, terrifying monster'. Such darkly sublime imagining is so far removed from the original bird of nature that it bears in the end no resemblance at all to the humbler, less visionary sorts of characterisations that we associate with the naturalism of John Clare. Something of Lawrence's dark sublime resurfaces in the bird poetry of Ted Hughes, author of one of the most notorious bird poems of the modern period, namely, Crow. This extraordinary work is for the most part a feat of purely imaginative and associative thinking, and contains little in the way of close, sympathetic observation. Crow is an imaginary, quasi-mythical entity, a fulsomely symbolic scapegoat that is also at the same time a creature of human fears, horrors, and impulses. It is the product of a human imagination working very much on the far side, as well as on the dark side, of things. Such an imagination is very different from, say, the Wordsworthian imagination or the naturalistic imagination - the kind of imagination that does its best work on the near side of things, illuminating, magnifying or otherwise reconceiving things, but never displacing them. The Hughesian imagination, as we find it at work in Crow , shows little or no allegiance to the natural objects that are alluded to in the poem, least of all to the common-or-garden crow. Crow is all 68 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4</page><page sequence="18">hectic, frenzied connotation, containing little in the way of denotative truth. The nearest that Crow comes to the crow of nature is perhaps in the section entitled 'Crow and the Birds' - the section reprinted in the Armitage and Dee anthology - where he is contrasted with a litany of other birds, all of which are more or less delicately represented: 'Crow spraddled head-down in the beach-garbage, guzzling a dropped ice- cream/25 But even in this 'realistic' line, the description is shot through with anthropomorphic judgment. In many other sections of Crow, Crow is the target of a good deal of baleful imagining and fabulously scornful myth-mongering. Nothing could be further removed from the joyfully lyrical naturalism of John Clare than Ted Hughes's Crow. In some of his other poems, Hughes comes closer to lyrically speaking the truth about birds, especially in 'Skylarks' and 'Swifts', where the sounds and flight patterns of the birds are tracked and shadowed in the formal features - the line-breaks, stanza-breaks, and shifting rhythms - of the poems themselves, as well as in the constant semantic 'striving' of the language of evocation. But even in these poems, a surprising level of negatively anthropomorphic judgment enters in: Crueller than owl or eagle A towered bird, shot through the crested head With the command, Not die But climb Climb Sing Obedient as to death a dead thing.26 'Obedient as to death a dead thing'! And this said of the skylark! In a later stanza, the skylarks are described as 'Squealing and gibbering and cursing / / [...] The mad earth's missionaries.' The swifts are not as harshly judged, though they too are linked to death: A bolas of three or four wire screams Jockeying across each other On their switchback wheel of death.27 Even when the poet reports burying a fledgling swift that he tried, unsuccessfully, to get to fly, he cannot seem to resist betraying in the end a bleakish human judgment: POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4 | 69</page><page sequence="19">Finally burial For the husk Of my little Apollo - The charred scream Folded in its huge power.28 What Munsterberg says of the treatment of birds in earlier poetry - that birds are 'accessories to the human scene' - can also be said of a great deal of more recent poetry, including much of the poetry written after John Clare. It can be said of Hughes's best-known bird poem, 'Hawk Roosting', in which anthropomorphic judgment once more comes powerfully into play. Perhaps more than any other modern bird poem, 'Hawk Roosting' labours under a paradox that besets any poet who attempts to write about a non-human form of life, while at the same time giving implicit expression to human attitudes and emotions. The poet regards the hawk as the compacted essence of Darwinian nature, red in beak and claw, devoid of all the sympathies of which human beings are capable - as if human sympathies, belated in evolutionary terms, are not quite as real as the older, more bloody-minded instincts of the bird of prey The hawk enjoys 'no falsifying dream'; it kills where it pleases; it needs no argument to support its 'right', which is to follow the path of its flight 'Through the bones of the living'. But for all its brutal, inhuman imputation, this tough-minded conception of the hawk is all human perception and projection, all brilliant poetic conceit, and is not based on any real understanding - impossible, in any case - of what it is like to be a hawk, roosting or otherwise. The hawk is not represented but rather made to represent an idea, namely, the idea of an overseeing, over- bearing, fascistically manipulative human mentality. The hawk, like Crow, is misrepresented, we might say. At the very least, the bird of nature is lost in the antics, linguistic and conceptual, of the poet's imagination. It is, by contrast, a radically important feature of Clare's naturalism that it is not judgmental in the way that Hughes's poetry is, nor is it ever prepared to 'frame', for poetic effect, any non-human creature - even a bird of prey. Clare does not assume that a bloody-minded conception of a bird or animal is necessarily the one that will take us closer to grasping its nature. This is not to say that Clare's poetry is mere versified ornithology. Munsterberg tends to separate out Clare's supposedly descriptive writing from his supposedly personal responses to the observed details of nature. But such a clear duality does not exist in Clare's poetry. At one point, Munsterberg herself suggests a more integrated conception of his achievement. She writes that his work 'is charged with a kind of wonder and joy, as if he were saying: Look! This is , this is true!'29 It is arguable 70 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4</page><page sequence="20">that all of his nature poetry is charged to varying degrees with this joy of observation. The freshness, sharpness, and vividness that Munsterberg attributes to Clare's exactitude of description might just as well be attrib- uted to the originally joyful nature of his observation. It is not as if he begins by making factual observations, and then sometimes follows these with a joyful response, which later makes its way into some poems, or into some parts of some poems. Rather, joy is almost always present to greater or lesser degrees, and it is this continual joy of observation that comes to express itself in such vividness of expression, exactitude and idiosyncrasy of word-choice, and plenitude of detail. This joy is different from that of the Romantic poets, since it remains close to the object of its causation, and does not soar away from it into either the ebullient, presumptive visions of, say, Shelley or the bleaker but equally presumptive visions of Ted Hughes. Much of the joy experienced and expressed by Clare is felt in the process of discovery, in learning more and more of the birds he observes. His subjectivity, as expressed in the poems, is not a Keatsian, Shelleyan, or even a Wordsworthian subjectivity, but one that is informed at every turn by facets of the thing itself, rather than by any notions, beliefs, moral lessons, myths or 'revelations' brought to mind by the experience of it. It could be said in criticism of Clare that his determination to have a joyful response to nature means that he ends up avoiding the harsher truths about birds and animals in general, especially the birds and beasts of prey - the very ones that are so graphically represented in the work of Lawrence, Hughes and others. When violence features in Clare's work, it tends to be perpetrated by human beings rather than by birds or beasts of prey. Even when he does write about a bird of prey, as in 'The Puddock's Nesť, he ends by noting the fact that the young birds are sometimes captured by the schoolboy who 'takes them home and often cuts their wing / And ties them in the garden with a string'.30 In Clare's defence, it might be said that the very idea of harsher truths about birds is a question-begging one to begin with, since it already implies a projection of human values into the world of bird and animal behaviour - a world that the human sensibility and imagination cannot easily, if ever, breach. Clare often alludes to the ways in which human actions and attitudes impinge, sometimes destructively, on the life of birds and animals, and he might justify the resolutely joyful nature of his observations by offering them as a way of righting the balance of relations between the human and non-human worlds. His joyfulness is not any kind of Romantic self-indulgence - it is an exercise, at the level of heartfelt attitude, in restorative justice. If his disposition towards joyfulness of observation does indeed prevent him turning his attention to the fiercer birds of prey, then so be it. The limits here are not set by the poet's POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4 | 7I</page><page sequence="21">capacity to observe but by his determination to avoid the kind of persecution' of the bird world that has been a feature, historically, of the unequal relationship between the human and non-human worlds. It is arguable, then, that John Clare has not been a pivotal influence in the evolution of a realistic or naturalistic tradition of bird poetry He is rarer than that. He is, we want to reiterate, sui generis. Certainly, there was no one before him who achieved his level of lyrical naturalism, except in occasional interludes and passing glimpses - including the delightful glimpses contained in the anonymous Old Irish poems that have come to be known as 'The Scribe in the Woods', 'The Blackbird by Belfast Loch', and The Blackbird Calling from the Willow'.31 But neither is there anyone who came after him who could be said to have carried forward, in a consistent and sustained way, the mantle of joyful observation of birds. There is no British - or Irish - tradition of naturalis- tic bird poetry, within which Clare could be said to hold a dominantly influential position. This is not to say that non-naturalistic bird poetry is not of great continued interest. Of course it is. Many of us would not be without the bird poems of Hardy, Thomas, Lawrence, or Hughes, just as we would not be without the earlier bird poems of the Romantics. It is to say only that John Clare stands alone, without equal, without successor. There are also, of course, individual poets who sometimes write fine individual poems that come close, or measure up on their own terms, to Clare's lyrical naturalism. The Armitage and Dee anthology contains a number of such poems, including Gillian Clarke's 'Curlew', John Hewitt's 'First Corncrake', Philip Larkin's 'Pigeons', Norman MacCaig's 'A Voice of Summer', and Sylvia Plath's 'Pheasants', but the relative rarity of such poems only serves to confirm the singular achieve- ment of the singular John Clare. 72 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IO4</page><page sequence="22">References i Mike Mockler (ed.), Flights of Imagination (Poole: Blanford Press, 1982), p. 9. 2 Ibid., p. 8. 3 Ibid., p. 10. 4 Peggy Munsterberg (ed.), The Penguin Book of Bird Poetry (London: Allen Lane, 1982), p. 35. 5 Ibid., p. 46. 6 Ibid., p. 50. 7 Ibid., p, 187.
