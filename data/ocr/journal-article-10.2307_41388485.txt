<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anny Crunelle-Vanrigh The Logic of the Same and Différance: "The Courtship of Mr Lyon" In his introduction to the collection of Angela Carter's short stories, Salman Rushdie notes how, in The Bloody Chamber ; "the fable of Beauty and the Beast [is made] a metaphor for all the myriad yearnings and dangers of sexual relations."1 Of all the stories in The Bloody Chamber, "The Courtship of Mr Lyon" is the least unsettling, one dealing with the "yearnings" more than the "dangers" of sex, if only because, closely following the plot of Madame Leprince de Beaumont's story, Carter also seems to endorse this eighteenth-century writer's moral point. "Courtship" is a tale about the harmonious passage from oedipal attachment to mature love marked by the metamorphosis of the Beast into a man. It holds a special place in the collection, referring back to the best-known version of "Beauty and the Beast" and preceding "The Tiger's Bride," its dark twin- piece. The quiet domesticity of the final image in "Courtship" makes it - with a good measure of irony - a socializing tale, quite unlike Carter's "Bride" or "The Werewolf," which disclose the animal at the heart of the human, the Beast always already within Beauty. Carter chooses the tale, the genre par excellence of iteration (re-telling), for her game of replication (re-writing). The double status of "Courtship" as fairy tale and as hypertext thus places repetition and difference at the core of her enterprise.2 A similar tension is to be felt between closure and indeterminacy. Fairy tales are informed by closure, a movement from change to permanence. Their plots move from an initial, pernicious metamorphosis to a stable identity Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies, Vol. 12, No. 1 (1998), pp. 116-32.

Carter, however, stubbornly moves the other way round, from stability to instability, undermining the closed binary logic of fairy tale and eventually substituting différance for différence or difference. She takes her reader along the paths of indeterminacy, revelling in a state of never-ending metamorphosis, as she disseminates her stories through The Bloody Chamber. Starting from repetition as the structuring principle of "The Courtship of Mr Lyon" and as a common denominator for its interpretation, whether in terms of narratology, genre, gender, or psychoanalysis, I shall attempt to trace how Carter challenges every one of these perspectives, the better to deconstruct them as all her work is a statement about Otherness and Difference. "Le plagiat est la base de toutes les littératures, excepté la première , qui d'ailleurs nous est inconnue All literature originates in plagiarism - all except the very first text, which anyway remains an unknown quantity. Carter's rewriting of popular tales in The Bloody Chamber is an exemplar of Jean Giraudoux's classic aphorism. Giraudoux, an adept at adapting stories from Greek mythology (La Guerre de Troie n'aura pas lieu, Amphitryon 38, Electre), addressed the questions of adaptation, imitation, re- writing - that is, more generally, hypertextuality. Implicit in his statement is the idea that the "pleasure of the text" is to be derived as much from the text itself as from the reader's identification of it as an instance of bricolage or palimpsest. The co-presence - and possible clash - of hypo- and hypertext, is what gives the experience of "palimpsestuous" reading its particular spice and pungency, with two texts superimposed, the original showing through.3 Though any hypertext, even Joyce's Ulysses, can be enjoyed per se, failing to identify it as a hypertext undermines the significance and aesthetic value underlying re-presentation. "The Courtship of Mr Lyon" moves to Beaumont's tale and back, empha- sizing its presence as a hypotext to Carter's hypertext. Carter thus creates a double textuality, relying on imitation and insistent differentiation. Her text depends on intertextuality and pastiche to proclaim its sense of belonging and simultaneously on anachronism and travesty to advertise its difference. Re- writing is an interplay of repetition, imitation and difference, which, as I hope to show, far exceeds the limits of a brilliant "writing game" for cognoscenti. "The Courtship of Mr Lyon" is overwhelmingly intertextual, like all of Carter's work. Its specific connection with the fairy tale as a genre is proclaimed through quotations and allusions complementing the overt hypertextuality of the narrative.4 The opening paragraph combines references to "Snow White" and "Cinderella": "Outside her kitchen window, the hedgerow glistened as if the snow possessed a light of its own. . . . This lovely girl, whose skin possesses that same, inner light so you would have thought she, too, was made all of 117</page><page sequence="3">ANNY CRUNELLE-VANRIGH snow, pauses in her chores in the mean kitchen to look out at the country road" (144). A brief echo of Alice in Wonderland points forward to the Beast's final metamorphosis: "On the table, a silver tray; round the neck of the whisky decanter, a silver tag with the legend: Drink me, while the cover of the silver dish was engraved with the exhortation: Eat me, in a flowing hand" (145). Embedded half-way through the narrative is Carter's acknowledgment of her source material, the "courtly and elegant French fairy tales about white cats who were transformed princesses and fairies who were birds" (148). Her portrayal of the Beast, with his agate eyes, "head of a lion," the "golden hair of [his] great paws" (147) looks like a color version of the leonine mask Cocteau designed for Jean Marais in his screen adaptation of "Beauty and the Beast." The Beast in Beaumont's version is a mere "monster," as shadowy as is Victor's Creature in Mary Shelley's Frankenstein , and certainly no lion. Only Cocteau's mythopoetic sense turned him into a lion. That the Beast's deal with the father in "Courtship" is triggered by the contemplation of Beauty's photograph "where the camera had captured a certain look she had" (147) and not by the mere mention of her existence, as in Beaumont, is additional evidence that Cocteau's film is part of the story's intertext. The cinematic structure of Carter's story - sequences, ellipses and abrupt cuts - points in the same direction. "One cannot imitate a text, only a style, that is, a genre," Genette suggests (91). He defines pastiche as pure entertainment, sprightly imitation devoid of satiric intent, the intertext's most playful mode. A puckish homage to the classics, Carter's imitation relies for its visibility on what the Russian Formalists termed "stylization" and Genette "saturation," an increased frequency of the traits - thematic, stylistic and otherwise - specific to a genre. This is where the fireworks of her language most perfectly answer the needs of fairy tale. An array of "might" and "as if" takes us into a world of porphyry and lapis lazuli, dul- cimers and turquoises, sometimes too much so for the purist's queasy stomach. "Some of her puddings are excessively egged," Rushdie conceded (Carter xiv). But then what of that? Is not the art of cuisine her most spirited metaphor for the art of writing, as demonstrated with untiring zest in "The Kitchen Child"?5 Is not pastiche, the old Italian pasticcio , a tasty potpourri of ingredients and flavors? Carter's awareness of etymology may well induce the reader to see in the text's partiality to food - "sandwiches of thick-cut roast-beef" (145), "cold soufflé, cheese" (147), "eggs Benedict and grilled veal" (148), incidentally eaten while browsing through a book - some form of metatextual comment, a literalization of etymology. The Beast's final utterance: "I think I might be able to manage a little breakfast today, Beauty, if you would eat something with me" (153) sounds like an invitation to share Carter's pasticcio , her feast of words. Words very much her own, however. In the tension between imitation and difference, pastiche and intertextuality speak for imitation, while textual 118</page><page sequence="4">THE LOGIC OF THE SAME AND DIFFÉRANCE intrusion, anachronism and reversal speak for difference. The text's (sparse) comments on its own narrative procedures jolt the reader into awareness of its fictional status. Textual intrusion acknowledges within the story the existence of a privileged space "where all the laws of the world . . . need not necessarily apply" (145). This is as good as a definition of the contract between the reader and the text, and a reminder of the text's artificiality and precariousness. Repeated anachronisms work to the same effect - telephones, a twenty-four- hour rescue service (146), a taxi (150), a slow train (151). This never-never land shot through with contemporary references works out a schizophrenic vision paralyzing the reader's willingness to suspend disbelief and forget the text's "otherness." Ironic reversals undercut the reader's expectations. Carter's Beauty is not the bashful girl of Beaumont's story. The selflessness of Beaumont's heroine is replaced by the thoughtlessness and narcissistic egotism of Beauty, oblivious of her promise. She flings herself into a mad whirl of pleasure with her father: "a resplendent hotel; the opera, theatres; a whole new wardrobe for his darling so she could step out on his arm to parties, to receptions, to restaurants, and life was as she had never known it" (150). Beaumont's demure girl, unaware of her own beauty, spends hours in Carter's tale looking at her reflection in the mirror (151). Carter actually substitutes modern stereotypes for old ones. Though Carter's Beauty is initially made to serve coffee to the Beast on their first evening together in the best tradition of the woman doubling as servant ("to her well- disguised dismay, she found her host, seated beside the fire with a tray of coffee at his elbow from which she must pour" 149; my emphasis), she soon takes over as the dominant partner to a shy, awkward, inarticulate male: "He forced himself to master his shyness, which was that of a wild creature, and so she contrived to master her own - to such effect that soon she was chattering away to him as if she had known him all her life" (149). Moving from woman's traditional inarticulateness ("small talk had never, at the best of times, been Beauty's forte" 149) to (frivolous) language, she is also seen to be the mistress of the sexual game. Her initial embarrassment betrays an awareness of sex which would have been foreign to Beaumont's heroine: "these strange companions were suddenly overcome with embarrassment to find themselves together, alone, in that room in the depths of the winter's night" (149). She is quite capable of decoding similar sexual awareness in the Beast. With a compassionate sense of superiority, she passes judgment on the inadequacy of this unusual Romeo who cannot "kiss by the book": "she felt his hot breath on her fingers, the stiff bristles of his muzzle grazing her skin, the rough lapping of his tongue and then, with a flood of compassion, understood: all he is doing is kissing my hands"(149). The final stage of their courtship is - most appropriately for a modern travesty - a bed scene, the symbolism of which Madame de Beaumont would most certainly 119</page><page sequence="5">ANNY CRUNELLE-VANRIGH have found objectionable: "She flung herself upon him, so that the iron bedstead groaned, and covered his poor paws with kisses. . . . When her lips touched the meat-hook claws, they drew back into their pads and she saw how he had always kept his fists clenched but now, painfully, tentatively, at last began to stretch his fingers" (153). Carter thus plays a subtle game of differences even as she acknowledges her indebtedness to a specific genre. Following her source more closely than she does in "The Bloody Chamber," she retains its system of binary oppositions up to a certain point, as is manifest in the handling of space, moving from London to the Beast's mansion and back. Yet Beaumont's system of binary oppositions is anchored not only in narratology, but also in the gender policy of her age, something Carter cannot endorse. Carter explodes it with infectious glee. She follows Beaumont the better to entrap her. The more rigid the stronghold, the greater the pleasure to blow it up. After ascertaining the parallel existence of two worlds, Carter derails the coding and the decoding, and throws the text back into undecidability, into a space in-between, into a world of neither/nor. Her strategy is one of deconstruc- tion. The two distinct worlds of Beauty and the Beast are gradually contaminated by each other, as are the protagonists themselves up until the final metamor- phosis. Undecidability is emblematically put forward as programmatic in the opening paragraph where Carter moves from the symbolic boundaries between inside and outside, "here" and "there," "hedgerow" and "kitchen window," to an unmarked snowy expanse, a road that is no longer one, "white and unmarked," present and absent, between presence and absence, undecidable, a trace. The text's incipit, like its two-line excipit, brackets the text as a parergon , a frame.6 Its very position, neither within nor without the narrative, both intrinsic and extrinsic, makes the text's opening yet another undecidable, blurring the limits of the text as aesthetic object: " Outside her kitchen window, the hedgerow glistened as if the snow possessed a light of its own. . . . This lovely girl, whose skin possesses that same, inner light so you would have thought she, too, was made all of snow, pauses in her chores in the mean kitchen to look out at the country road. Nothing has passed that way all day; the road is white and unmarked as a spilled bolt of bridal satin" (144; my emphasis). From here the text's symbolic thresholds (the mansion's wrought-iron gate, its mahogany front door, etc.) no longer usher the reader into a radically different world, but into one which is neither the same nor different. They are not so much thresholds as distorting mirrors. Spaces begin to overlap. The required timelessness of the Beast's world is shot through with ref- erences to a "Palladian house" (144), a Queen Anne dining room (147), "a garage that advertised a twenty-four-hour rescue service" (146), anachronisms belonging to travesty, one of the burlesque modes of hypertextuality.7 But 120</page><page sequence="6">THE LOGIC OF THE SAME AND DIFFÊRANCE conversely, timelessness steals its way into Beauty's world of lawyers and florists and evenings out at the opera. She forgets her promise to the Beast because her own world is more timeless than his: "since the flowers in the shops were the same all the year round, nothing in the window could tell her that winter had almost gone" (151). Carter makes a similar point with her use of the anthropomorphic motif. She plays it down in the Beast's world ("she saw, with an indescribable shock, he went on all fours," 149) but reactivates it metaphorically in Beauty's. Animality permeates the girl's human-ness. She is first a sacrificial "Miss Lamb" (148), a dish fit for a lion - a normal enough fate for the daughter of a man who first appears wrapped in a sheepskin coat. She then goes on a shopping spree for expensive furs (151), and Carter eventually turns her into a predatory sort of animal, a milder version of her leonine suitor: "Her face was acquiring, instead of beauty, a lacquer of the invincible prettiness that characterizes certain pampered, exquisite, expensive cats" (151). The change she undergoes here as she symbolically moves to sexual awareness is not seen in human but animal terms. She does not move from girl to adolescent but from "Miss Lamb" to "pampered cat." This transformation, though merely metaphorical, deconstructs her role as the instrument of the Beast's final metamorphosis into a man. It adumbrates the female narrator's change into a Tiger in the final line of "The Tiger's Bride." "Courtship" ends on the ambiguous image of a man "with a distant, heroic resemblance to the handsomest of all the beasts." The equivocal name of Mr and Mrs Lyon, half human, half animal, epitomizes their ambiguous nature. This final instance of undecidability takes us a long way from Beaumont's fable of virtue recompensed and humanity restored.8 The spaniel partakes of both worlds too, as emphasized by the narrative voice: "if she had not been a dog, she would have been in tears" (151). The spaniel wears no collar, but a diamond necklace (145). A creature in-between (and female), she is the story's go-between, the embodiment of the "betweenness" that is so much part of this text. Carter playfully goes all the way from the kind of clear-cut oppositions encapsulated in Beauty's initial either/or view - "a lion is a lion and a man is a man and, though lions are more beautiful by far than we are, yet they belong to a different order of beauty" (147) - to the kind of shady categories where a creature is neither a man nor a lion, both man and lion. The very genre of "Courtship" becomes undecidable. Its style and plot belong to the Märchen , but the magic motifs of the original - the fairy tale signature - have gone, most notably the fairy's curse. The Beast's plight is never ascribed to any magic charm to be dispelled by the virtuous love of a beautiful princess. The final metamorphosis is "psychologized" as a result.9 It takes place in Beauty's eye much rather than in the Beast's body, as if scales fell from her eyes and her initial judgment had been the result of some form of myopia or hermeneutic 121</page><page sequence="7">ANNY CRUNELLE-VANRIGH confusion, a mere problem of interpretation: "How was it that she had never noticed before that his agate eyes were equipped with lids, like those of a man? Was it because she had only looked at her own face, reflected there?" (152). "Psychologization" becomes itself one of the text's undecidables and opens it up. The narrative is destabilized, and standard critical procedures break down along with the reader's assumption that s/he can master whatever is inside it. Carter imitates Beaumont the way Derrida imitates Joyce in "Ulysses Gramophone," to keep the narrative at play. Märchen , psychoanalyst Bruno Bettelheim demonstrated in The Uses of Enchantment, convey overt and covert meanings. They overtly advocate moral conduct as advantageous both to the individual and to the social structure; they also covertly convey - on account of their inclusion in the larger cate- gory of myths - symbolic meanings, all operating along lines later explored and mapped out by psychoanalysis. The sort of psychologization favored by modern hypertexts, which internalizes processes so far described as external to the psyche (curse, potion or spell), similarly foregrounds analytic disclosure. Repetition has a similar impact. Unlike poetry or the novel, but like myth or drama, Märchen depend on telling and re-telling, on the endless and preferably exact repetition of the same story. Familiarity, not novelty, is what matters, what signifies. Repetition is central to psychoanalysis as well. It is a basic phenomenon of the psyche, the manifestation of the unconscious whether in the form of the return of the repressed, the repetition compulsion, or simply transference.10 The analytic situation tracks down the compulsion to repeat, inducing the repressed to return and be re-lived, re-presented, re-enacted (and eventually ab-reacted) in transference. Both symptom and cure are dependent on repetition. Dramatic re- presentation is one such form of transference, and the stage a privileged place of catharsis, be it in Aristotle's or psychoanalyst André Green's sense of the word.11 The performing arts are, Freud suggests cryptically in the final lines of Beyond the Pleasure Principle, the adult form of the fort-da game he had observed in his nephew and interpreted as an attempt to master through repetition an unpleasant situation.12 The child's untiring (and possibly tiresome) desire to hear the same old story over and over again is part of the same process: "Soon he will indicate that a certain story has become important to him by his immediate response to it, or by his asking to be told the story over and over again. . . . Finally there will come the time when the child has gained all he can from the preferred story or the problems which made him respond to it have been replaced by others which find better expression in some other tale" (Bettelheim 18). As repetition betokens the presence of drives, it is only natural that drives should find a metaphoric expression in a genre ruled by repetition. That Carter's text is the product of re-writing and pastiche - that is again, repetition - results 122 ~~</page><page sequence="8">THE LOGIC OF THE SAME AND DIFFÉRANCE in a significant mise en abyme, particularly fitted to the mechanisms at work in the tale. Bettelheim sees in Beaumont's "Beauty and the Beast" a harmonious passage from a previously solved oedipal attachment to mature love. In terms of Bettelheim's metaphors, the tale starts at the stage when the child has renounced sexual desire for its parent but has not yet moved to mature sexual attachment. Non-sexual attachment to the father is symbolized by the white rose Beauty requests from him. Yet this attachment still rules the child's life, for whom the parent remains the only love object. Beauty is willing to sacrifice herself for her father and would much rather face death for herself than let him die: Il ne périra point. Puisque le monstre veut bien accepter une de ses filles, je veux me livrer à toute sa furie et je me trouve fort heureuse puisqu'en mourant j'aurai la joie de sauver mon père et de lui prouver ma tendresse. (Leprince de Beaumont 21) (He shall not die. Since this monster is willing to accept one of his daughters in his stead, I will deliver myself unto his fearful hands and hold myself fortunate thus by my death to save my father's life and attest the love I bear him.) [my translation] Sex at this stage is still envisaged by the child as repulsive and bestial, as a result of the repression of incestuous desires. Love has yet to be transferred from the parent to a new love object from whom all (including sexual) gratifications will from then on be derived. This is shown to be achieved in the tale when the Beast, not the father any more, holds in his hands the family's fortunes - he can take care of the child. When Beauty is magically transported back to her father's home, in an attempted regression into childhood, she finds herself provided with rich clothes. But they are a gift from her suitor, not her father who has now given up his role as sole provider for the child: La Belle, après les premiers transports, pensa qu'elle n'avait point d'habits pour se lever; mais la servante lui dit qu'elle venait de trouver dans la chambre voisine un grand coffre plein de robes d'or, garnies de diamants. Belle remercia la bonne Bête de ses attentions. Elle prit la moins riche de ces robes et dit à la servante de ranger les autres dont elle voulait faire présent à ses soeurs. Mais à peine eut-elle prononcé ces paroles que le coffre disparut. Son père lui dit que la Bête voulait qu'elle gardât tout pour elle, et aussitôt les robes et le coffre revinrent à la même place. (Leprince de Beaumont 35) (After warmly greeting her father it occurred to Beauty that she had no proper clothes to wear, but her maid told her that she had just found in the next room a large chest with intertissued robes of gold 123</page><page sequence="9">ANNY CRUNELLE-VANRIGH and diamonds. Beauty was grateful to the Beast for his bounties. She chose the least expensive from amongst these robes and requested the maidservant to store away the others which she intended to give unto her sisters. But no sooner had she uttered these words than the chest vanished into thin air. Her father told her that it was the Beast's intention that she should keep them for herself, whereupon chest and robes reappeared.) [my translation] Beauty's future is thus shown to lie with the Beast. When she acknowledges this and returns to him, accepting him as a desirable love object, sexuality ceases to appear as a source of anguish, and the monstrous Beast turns into a most eligible Prince Charming. This is Bettelheim's account of Madame de Beaumont's tale. Not Carter's. Her careful deconstruction of form and genre affects meaning as well. As I have discussed, she pulled down the binary system structuring Beaumont's tale. This same binary system also structured that version along the gender lines of the patriarchal system in which Beaumont lived and wrote. Carter's écriture now plays havoc with it. Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont published books by the dozen and lived by her pen, out of necessity more than choice. This alone does not make a woman a proto-feminist and a pioneer of écriture féminine in eighteenth-century France. She wrote edifying books with a moral purpose. A governess and private tutor, she was the product of her time and an instrument in the perpetuation of its values. "Beauty and the Beast" features a bourgeois family, rich, patriarchal and motherless. The whole life of the merchant's three daughters revolves around marriage, a woman's sole way to rise in class-status. The open ambition of the two "evil" daughters in the family is to marry up into the nobility. Nothing barring a duchy will do. Beauty has "greatness thrust upon her" by the sheer merit of her virtue and charity, without the taint of personal ambition. She achieves her advancement, social and matrimonial, by proving submissive, passive, self-effacing, self-sacrificing. She is a virtuous daughter with a natural instinct for domesticity and has all the qualities pertaining to a mother. In other words, she is an ideal woman, never autonomous, always dependent on a man (husband or father) for her welfare and her happiness. She depends on him for her very existence as well perhaps, as is implicitly suggested by the absence of a mother who appears tastefully to have died in childbirth, leaving the road clear for patriarchal structures to develop unimpeded. She is literally made into a self- less woman. The text is informed by the binary logic of patriarchal thinking - ambition/submissiveness, father/daughter, wife/husband, good/evil, rich/poor, active/passive - all subsumed under the masculine/feminine opposition and the hierarchy implicit in it. In such fairy tales, submission to masculinity is the be-all 124</page><page sequence="10">THE LOGIC OF THE SAME AND DIFFÉRANCE and end-all of her being, a bed the beginning and end of her journey, as Hélène Cixous once wrote in an analysis of "Sleeping Beauty": "Woman, if you look for her, has a strong chance of always being found in one position: in bed. In bed and asleep - 'laid (out).' She is always to be found on or in a bed: Sleeping Beauty is lifted from her bed by a man because, as we all know, women don't wake up by themselves: man has to intervene, you understand. She is lifted up by the man who will lay her in her next bed so that she may be confined to bed ever after, just as the fairy tales say" ("Castration" 43). "Beauty and the Beast" follows this pattern, carrying out the law of the Father, the law of the male. It flourishes at the point where analytic discourse and patriarchal gender-policy meet. "Courtship" originates at the point where they move apart. "Courtship" does map out sexual awakening along the traditional lines of Bettelheim's psychology. Beauty has reached "the end of her adolescence" (151) - symbolically registered as the end of winter - and is hovering on the brink of a change she both longs for and shrinks from: "She sent him flowers, white roses in return for the ones he had given her, and when she left the florist, she experienced a sudden sense of perfect freedom, as if she had just escaped from an unknown danger, had been grazed by the possibility of some change but, finally, left intact. Yet, with this exhilaration, a desolating emptiness" (151). At the first mention of spring, the text names the urge and ushers in its messenger: The soft wind of spring breathed in from the nearby park through the open window; she did not know why it made her want to cry. There was a sudden urgent , scrabbling sound, as of claws, at her door. (151; my emphasis) Still Carter will not go beyond this into supporting the gender policy exemplified in Beaumont's tale. The ironic blending of old and new stereotypes of woman - Beauty serving coffee, sitting at her embroidery, Beauty gardening, Beauty socializing glamorously - punctures the underlying ideology of Beau- mont's version. So does the prosaic bourgeois domesticity of the final lines, displayed as a down-to-earth, anticlimactic equivalent of the tale's formulaic ending "and they lived happily ever after." Carter in "Courtship" uses "Beauty and the Beast" as a paradigm of the phallocentrism at the core of fairy tales. She playfully erodes the illusions of a value system which presents Man as the Alpha and Omega of Creation by suggesting that the Beast's metamorphosis into a man is less than a blessing, much rather a fall from grace: "And it was no longer a lion in her arms but a man, a man with an unkempt mane of hair, and how strange, a broken nose, such as the noses of retired boxers, that gave him a distant, heroic resemblance to the handsomest of all the beasts" (153). She gives the story's "apotheosis" a distinct whiff of nostalgia with its "drift of 125</page><page sequence="11">ANNY CRUNELLE-VANRIGH fallen petals" (153) that takes it headlong into autumn instead of eternity. The final advent of man as the symbol and source of power conspicuously spells the end of magic in the tale. Re-writing the text with a difference, the difference brought about by feminism, Carter marks the limits of the ideology underlying "Beauty and the Beast." She starts sounding a note of her own. Carter's text shows the disappointing victory of binary thinking, of either/or , but celebrates the nostalgia of a form of all-inclusiveness. The Beast was infinitely superior to his disappointingly human avatar. Beauty's metamorphosis into a full-grown woman is seen in terms of more, not less, animality. Here Carter departs entirely from the original in which man is duly redeemed from animality. In "Courtship," she builds the premises of the system developed in "The Tiger's Bride," in many way the twin essay of "Courtship," a cruel, unsettling twin. What "Courtship" merely adumbrates, "Bride" brings to the fore. There the female narrator's father is no good old man plagued by ill-luck, but a drunkard "in the last stages of debauchery" who plays - and loses - his daughter at cards. Carter reverses the child's willingness to sacrifice everything to the loved parent into the parent's own willingness to sacrifice all, child and wife, to his mad egotism and childish pleasure-seeking. Whereas Beauty accepted, even "with a pang of dread," that her visit to the Beast should be "the price of her father's good fortune" (148), the narrator of "The Tiger's Bride" recalls how her own mother was "bartered for her dowry to such a feckless sprig of the Russian nobility that she soon died of his gaming, his whoring, his agonized repentances" (155). In "Bride," the exchange of a white rose between father and daughter grows distressingly ironic, no longer a father's love token to his beloved child, but the daughter's reluctant (and hence meaningless) sign of her forgiveness: "My tear-beslobbered father wants a rose to show that I forgive him" (158). A similar reversal is worked in the animality motif: the Beast is no longer a man with the appearance of a lion but a tiger wearing the mask of a man. Can one say more clearly that identity is an artifact? He throws our aspirations to the godlike sadly awry, poor fellow; only from a distance would you think The Beast not much different from any other man, although he wears a mask with a man's face painted most beautifully on it. Oh, yes, a beautiful face; but one with too much formal symmetry of feature to be entirely human: one profile of his mask is the mirror image of the other, too perfect, uncanny. He wears a wig, too, false hair tied at the nape with a bow, a wig of the kind you see in old-fashioned portraits. (156) Beauty's kiss turning the Lion back into a man is changed to the Tiger's tongue licking his bride into his likeness, in a striking reversal (or is it a continuation?) of the transformation scene in "Courtship": "And each stroke of his tongue 126</page><page sequence="12">THE LOGIC OF THE SAME AND DIFFÉRANCE ripped off skin after successive skin, all the skins of a life in the world, and left behind a nascent patina of shining hairs. My earrings turned back to water and trickled down my shoulders; I shrugged the drops off my beautiful fur" (169). It is "as though her whole body were being deflowered and so metamorphosing into a new instrument of desire, allowing her admission to a new ('animal' in the sense of spiritual as well as tigerish ) world," Rushdie comments (Carter xii). Here is the point of Carter's deconstruction of fairy tales. Where Beaumont starts from a recognition of the potentially dangerous polymorphousness latent in each individual and attempts to fix and channel and castrate it according to the requirements of the social structure, Carter's stories move toward polymorphousness as a desirable, excitingly perverse end. Pleasure lies in the unfixing of identity, in the recognition of its fluidity. The fairy tale moves from the margins to the center, Carter from the center to the margins. The hopelessly closed ending of "Courtship" with its couple walking for eternity in an autumn garden that looks alarmingly like a sepia photograph from an old family album is superseded in "The Tiger's Bride" by the open-endedness of a metamorphosis in the making. It celebrates the perverse desirability of indeterminacy and liminality, the erotic but dangerous fascination of multiplicity. The Golden Herm of Wise Children is another such figure, his androgyny the equivalent of "humanimality" in The Bloody Chamber. The fixed meaning guaranteed by the extra-systemic metaphysics of (male) Presence is replaced by a game of difjérance , of volatile and unstable identity - beast or beauty, tiger or bride, wolf or girl - in which the new identity/signifier can in a sense be said to give meaning to the previous one and so on "forever after."13 The process of deferral thus established is reflected in the very process of Carter's re-writing of Beaumont's story and in making its modern avatar part of a larger series. Not one of the stories at play in The Bloody Chamber can be said to signify in itself, though it can be enjoyed on its own. The meaning of "Courtship" is constructed through a process of referring to other texts. Coming from, and pointing back and forward, to other stories, it is only one signifier in the process of referring to other, absent signifiers. There is a constant interplay, a game of difjérance in which the meaning of "Beauty and the Beast," which Madame de Beaumont had intended as fixed and self-constituted, is now made volatile, permanently deferred, as we move from tale to tale of changing forms and metamorphoses, from "The Courtship of Mr Lyon" to "The Tiger's Bride," "The Snow Child" and "Wolf-Alice."14 Carter's deconstruction of fairy tales is part of a larger feminist statement. With a few exceptions, instability is a character of, or is granted by, the feminine. Woman, in the form of Beauty or the Wolf-girl, is the liminal figure endowed with a power to take her partner across the boundaries of either/or into un- decidability and the destabilization of identity ("Wolf- Alice" and "Courtship"). ~YTl</page><page sequence="13">ANNY CRUNELLE-VANRIGH Or she is merely enjoying for herself the crossing of the line, the state of in- between. The heroine of "The Tiger's Bride" moves almost naturally from one layer of identity to the next as she divests herself of her clothes. She moves from clothes to skin to fur, helped through the last stage of her metamorphosis by the Beast's tongue ripping off "skin after successive skin, all the skins of a life in the world" until there appears this "nascent patina of shining hairs" (169). The Beast, unlike his bride, never fuses human mask and tiger's fur, never masters this neither/nor condition so clearly spelt out in "Wolf-Alice": "Nothing about her is human except that she is not a wolf; it is as if the fur she thought she wore had melted into her skin and become part of it, although it does not exist" (221). Dressing-gown, mask and wig are not part of the Beast, but a costume, "the empty house of his appearance" (168). Man or Tiger, but never both, he is a prisoner of dualism, while Alice and the Tiger's bride are representatives of another, feminine, plural economy. Carter's extreme statement of her sexual politics appears in "Peter and the Wolf," a story featuring the encounter of the masculine and the feminine as implied in the title. Peter, whose hypotextual model is the gun- toting little boy of Prokofiev's piece, discovers sexual difference in the form of a wolf-girl. Peter's fascination with her sex is seen in terms which recall Carter's description of the Tiger's bride's transformation, an endless receding into Otherness: He could not take his eyes off the sight of the crevice of her girl-child's sex, that was perfectly visible to him as she sat there square on the base of her spine. ... It was neither dark nor light indoors yet the boy could see her intimacy clearly, as if by its own phosphorescence. It exercised an absolute fascination upon him. Her lips opened up as she howled so that she offered him, without her own intention or volition, a view of a set of Chinese boxes of whorled flesh that seemed to open one upon another into herself, drawing him into an inner, secret place in which destination perpetu- ally receded before him, his first, devastating, vertiginous intimation of infinity She howled. And went on howling until, from the mountain, first singly, then in a complex polyphony, answered at last voices in the same language. (287-88) Inner and outer lips, sex and voice merge. But the infinity of her sex cannot be articulated, just howled. Or sung, as the Sphinx does: "She's an animal and she sings out. She sings out because women do . . . they do utter a little, but they don't speak" (Cixous, "Castration" 49). Language is the mark of the Symbolic and she is outside the Symbolic, embedded in the Imaginary. Her language is 128</page><page sequence="14">THE LOGIC OF THE SAME AND DIFFÉRANCE of a different nature, not the product of the Law, like Peter's, but "a complex polyphony," beyond the reductive articulateness of male language.15 Just as she is outside the Symbolic, she is outside the city ("the city is man, ruled by masculine law"; Cixous, "Castration" 49) or on the other side of the river, across the boundary from where Peter watches her. Peter is momentarily tempted "to cross over to the other side to join her in her marvellous and private grace, impelled by the access of an almost visionary ecstasy" (290). He is aware that this would have to be at the cost of language, as "language crumbled into dust under the weight of her speechlessness" (290). 16 On the verge of discovering the mystery of Otherness, he looks at her. Indeterminacy and inarticulateness descend upon him: "The boy began to tremble and shake. His skin prickled. He felt he had been made of snow and now might melt. He mumbled something, or sobbed" (290). There is a moment of recognition as he is about to cross into the realm of the feminine, something like the unbelievable discovery of a common nature: the wolf-girl is acknowledged as "his cousin" (290). Otherness is knowable and "there was nothing to be afraid of" (291). "The ' Black Continent ' is neither black nor inexplorable" (Cixous, "The Laugh" 255). The text marks Peter's initiation into Otherness with a deluge of water, both baptismal and feminine: "He burst out crying. He had not cried since his grandmother's funeral. Tears rolled down his face and splashed on the grass. He blundered forward a few steps into the river with his arms held open, intending to cross over to the other side" (290). He is on the verge of attaining knowledge of the feminine - which subsequently supersedes the quest for male knowledge which was taking him to the seminary. He very nearly steps into a realm described by Cixous as essentially fluid: "We are ourselves sea, sand, coral, sea-weed, beaches, tides, swimmers, children, waves" (Cixous, "The Laugh" 260). But Carter takes this moment away from us: "His cousin took fright at the sudden movement, wrenched her teats away from the cubs and ran off" (290). The feminine eventually remains elusive. Peter dries himself and retreats into manhood again: "When the boy recovered himself, he dried his tears on his sleeves, took off his soaked boots and dried his feet and legs on the tail of his shirt" (291). Yet he has learned something: "What would he do at the seminary now?" (291). And so he turns his back on the wolf-girl's mountain. He crosses back into the structured space of the Symbolic, towards the town, "into a different story." What story? A man's story? Or that of a boy who once encountered the mystery of Otherness? Carter will not say. It will remain undecidable. Carter's appropriation of the icons of culture covers an eclectic range going from Beaumont to Perrault ("Puss in Boots"), to Collodi ("The Loves of Lady Purple"), to major luminaries such as Poe ("The Cabinet of Edgar 129</page><page sequence="15">ANNY CRUNELLE-VANRIGH Allan Poe") and Shakespeare ("Overture and Incidental Music for A Midsummer Night's Dream," Wise Children ). This makes repetition and difference the prime movers of her writing practice. Central to hypertextuality, though from a purely technical perspective, these strategies take on a different magnitude with the rewriting of Kinder-Märchen. Tales, like psychoanalysis, the instrument of their decipherment, rely on repetition, but repetition that is more to do with meaning than technique. Carter, a great explorer of fantasy and fantasies, takes this as an opportunity to shed some light in obscure recesses, harping again on daughters, fathers and mothers, even if it requires bringing them back from the dead as she does in "Ashputtle or The Mother's Ghost." She is not one for comfortable truths and middle-of-the-road notions, however. She goes for the margins - some might say for the throat. She splits open closed texts and revels in what she finds there, blood, scars, perversion. She puts her dialectic of repetition and difference at the service of a revaluation of the marginal that is the feminine, sabotaging - as she would - patriarchal structures and phallogocentrism, indulging in the fantasy of an undecidable being, the wolf-girl, both animal and woman, Carter's most mysterious representative of feminine Otherness.

A branch of transtextuality, hypertextuality denotes any kind of connection existing between text В (which he calls hypertext ) and text A (which he calls hypotext ) from which В is derived. What Genette calls hypotext, Louis Marin calls architext. Here I follow Genette's terminology throughout for consistency. 3. The term "palimpsestuous" was coined by Philippe Lejeune and taken up by Genette (450). 4. 1 here follow Genette's restricted definition of intertextuality as the co-presence of two or more texts in the explicit form of quotations or allusions, i.e., as micro-, not macro-structures. Riffaterre's larger definition of the concept is subsumed in Genette's "transtextuality" (Genette 8-9). 5. See Crunelle-Vanrigh. 6. Derrida calls parerga such parts of a work of art as are attached to it but not part of its intrinsic form, e.g., a picture frame, the prologue to a play, or, as in "Courtship," the incipit, clearly standing out from the rest of the text. 7. Genette 73-74. 8. 1 use the world fable here because Madame Leprince de Beaumont's and Madame d'Aulnoy's works ap a cross between Märchen and moral fables. One eventually gets the feeling that the magic is subordinated to the moral discourse or even that the moral discourse masquerades as fairy tale. It is symptomatic that Madame d'Aulnoy's "tales" conclude on a rhymed epilogue in the style of La Fontaine's fables, extolling the Christian virtues of pity, charity and the love of one's neighbour which alone can earn the heroine the ultimate recompense of "living happily ever after." 9. Genette considers psychologization a side effect of modern transposition. In Wag- ner's adaptation of Gottfried's early poem, for example, the passion of Tristan and 130</page><page sequence="16">THE LOGIC OF THE SAME AND DIFFÉRANCE Isolde is immediate and natural, not induced by Brangäne's love potion. Modern transpositions tend to substitute an inner, natural cause, for one that was external, and supernatural. Drives are the modern face of the ancient fatum as in O'Neill's trilogy (Genette 375). 10. Repetition is explored in particular in The Uncanny (1911), Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1927), and Inhibition, Symptoms and Anxiety (1926). 11. See Green 29-35. He refuses the classic Christian definition of catharsis as a purification of emotions, but sees it as a release, i.e., Freudian abreaction. 12. The child threw a wooden piece of reel out of sight over the side of his cot, then pulled it back again into sight. For Freud this game was the child's symbolic attempt to represent the regular experience of his mother's absence and return, along with his symbolic mastery of it. 13. For Derrida, différance is the opposite of logocentrism. Logocentrism, "the matrix of every idealism," posits the existence of fixed meanings (absolute knowledge, original truth, determinate signification) guaranteed by an extra-systemic Presence. Derrida sees this as a mere attempt to control the proliferating play of signifiers by making them subject to a transcendental signified. Such a centered structure results in a binary system of hierarchical values on the either I or mode (nature/culture; speech/writing; mind/body; true/false; present/absent). He questions the idea that the world is governed by decidable categories, and defeats the oppositional logic of Western philosophy. He emphasizes instead the notion of undecidability (nei- ther/nor, and/and) cutting across the oppositional logic. Différance is one of these neither /nor. A coinage bringing together the two meanings of the French différer, dif- ference and deferment (and incidentally an example of the neither ¡nor mode), it sees meaning as permanently deferred. In the absence of signifieds, the signifier refers only to other signifiers. Language is in a state of endless seeding (dissemination), as a result of the play of signifiers. "This, strictly speaking, amounts to destroying the concept of 'sign' and its entire logic," Derrida admitted (Of Grammatology 7). Another casualty is the male/female category, the foundation of patriarchal thinking, which is where Cixous takes over from Derrida. 14. A similar experience in dissemination is carried out in "Ashputtle," where Carter offers three versions of the same story. 15. The wolf-girl's "howling" is Carter's extremest form of "Other language," the crude - ness of which is to do with the specific form given to the feminine in the story. Yet even this choice is a significant statement of how womanspeak is "the Voice, a song before the Law, before the breath was split by the Symbolic, reappropriated into language under the authority that separates" (Cixous, La Jeune Née 172; trans. Moi 114). 16. The wolf-girl's speechlessness works the same effects as womanspeak: it "explodes all firmly established forms, figures, ideas, concepts" (Irigaray 76). Works Cited Bettelheim, Bruno.
