<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT RESEARCH The following reports were submitted in February, 1970, by their compilers to Francis Riddell, former Associate Editor for Current Research. By the time they were received by the general Editor, it was too late to include them in an earlier issue of the journal. Several of the reports have been heavily edited by Edwin N. Wilmsen who must bear responsibility for omitting (inadvertently) important material. SOUTHWEST NEVADA. The Desert Research Institute, Univer- sity of Nevada, Reno, conducted excavations in upper Meadow Valley Wash, a Virgin River tributary. The excavation program was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation. The program was direct- ed by Don D. Fowler; David B. Madsen served as field supervisor, assisted by Douglas Smith. The 1969 sea- son extended a program of survey and excavation in Meadow Valley and the adjacent Paranagut Valley begun in 1967 by Fowler and Floyd W. Sharrock. Three sites were excavated and two others tested. The Conway site is a large rockshelter in a side canyon of Meadow Valley Wash. It contained 5 m. of deposit in which there were six cultural strata each separated by 20-80 cm. strata of alluvial sand and gravel. The earlier occupation is Desert Archaic; the middle occu- pation levels contained both Virgin branch and Western Fremont ceramics. The penultimate level con- tained Western Fremont and Shoshonean tradition ceramics; the topmost level yielded onlyShoshonean ceramics, Desert side-notched points etc. A small dry cave, 26LN402, was cleared. It had been badly van- dalized but yielded a large organic sample and a "Fremont" moccasin. The Oak Springs site is a large 200 m. sq. open site in the pinyon-juniper zone. The site contained both Virgin branch and Western Fre- mont ceramics. Stein Shelter, a large rockshelter near the Conway site was tested. This site has over 100 red-pigment Fremont-style pictographs on the walls. A fourth rockshelter, 26LN418, was tested at the end of the season. The occupation sequence is similar to the Conway site but may extend further back into the Desert Archaic period. UTAH. Gary F. Fry (University of Utah) con- ducted excavations at two Fremont sites on the north bank of the Bear River. One site, 42BO109, was badly disturbed by badger activity, but limited excavation revealed at least one pit house and a quantity of painted pottery. A presumed late date for the site was confirmed by a single radiocarbon age determination of about A.D. 1310?110 (RL-19). The second site, 42B0107, contains two com- ponents, both Fremont. One component, with radio- carbon dates of A.D. 700?140 (RL-35) and A.D. 780?140 (RL-34), comprises three small, circular sur- face dwellings much like those previously reported from nearby Bear River No. 3, along with a few trash and storage pits. The ceramic complex consists uniformly of unpainted graywares. A later component at the site, radiocarbon dated to between A.D. 1090 and 1240, consists of three quadrilateral dwelling pits and the usual complement of trash-storage pits associated with sites in the lower Bear River drainage. A pilot survey of the northwestern corner of Utah, conducted by John P. Marwitt (University of Utah) was successful in locating about 40 sites. A large proportion of the sites are situated along the course of Dove Creek. Occupation of extreme northwest Utah, probably Shoshone, is attested by the presence of several camps along the southern flank of the Raft River mountains and in the upper part of the Dove Creek drainage. Pollen analysis of human coprolites and fill from Hogup Cave by Gerald Kelso (University of Arizona) has revealed a major dependence on the Cheno- podiaceae (mainly Allenrolfea) below Level 12, which is in agreement with the coprolite macrofossil data analyzed by Gary F. Fry. Levels 12 through 16 show increasing use of other plant resources, especially grasses. COLORADO. The University of Colorado Mesa Verde Archaeological Research Center participated in five projects in 1969. Two excavations were on the Mesa Verde proper. Excavation at site MV820, first occupied in Pueblo I times, in the Far View area was completed. Major construction and occupation were Pueblo II, and the site was abandoned in early Pueblo III. Also in the Far View area, Mummy Lake was cleared of brush, all the upper rock walls exposed, the intake system(s) determined, and cuts were made through the surrounding banks and across the dia- meter of the lake depression. Two main construction periods were identified, each with a different intake channel at the point where water was put into this reservoir. No outlet was found, but a masonry stair- way in the south bank allowed access to the stored water. The dating of Mummy Lake coincides with MV820, and the other dwelling sites in the Far View area. Another season of survey essentially completed the inventory of sites on Bureau of Land Management lands in southwestern Colorado which lie south and west of Highway 160. Archaeological survey work was initiated on the Southern Ute Reservation, under the sponsorship of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Southern Ute Tribal Council. United States Forest Service lands adjacent to the Southern Ute Reservation in the Chimney Rock area were also surveyed for the Forest Service. ARIZONA. A joint Arizona State Museum-Museum of Northern Arizona expedition continued excavations at the Wild Goose site, NA9059, on the Virgin River near St. George, exploring more extensively a deep series of alluvial deposits that lay below an associated rockshelter dug in 1968. Non-ceramic and ceramic occupations are recognized for the site. Excavations, sponsored by the National Geographic Society and directed by Robert C. Euler, were under- ;06</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH taken at Stantons Cave in Marble Canyon National Monument on the Colorado River. More than 60 figurines associated with the Grand Canyon split-twig figurine complex were uncovered in situ, all within 5 cm. of the surface. There were no other associated artifacts. Beneath the figurine level, to a maximum depth of 1.5 m., quantities of biological material were recovered. Analyses of these materials, when com- pleted, should yield data about paleo-climatic conditions in Grand Canyon extending back perhaps as much as 30,000 years. Robert C. Euler and George J. Gumerman tested a rockshelter in the Grand Canyon along the Little Colorado River 0.5 mi. from the confluence of the Colorado River. Surface and near-surface material in- cludes Paiute and historic Hopi. The stratigraphic sequence continues through a Kayenta Anasazi Pueblo III, II, and I sequence. A non-ceramic deposit was found above the basal sterile layer. The Museum of Northern Arizona and Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, University of Arizona, initiated an archaeological survey of Long House Valley. Sixty- five sites were recorded ranging in time from prehistoric Basketmaker II through Pueblo IV, and historic Navajo and Hopi. Prescott College continued its archaeological field school on Black Mesa in northeastern Arizona for the second year under the field direction of George J. Gumerman. Peabody Coal Company sponsored the excavation of 13 sites, five of which are Navajo and the remainder Kayenta Anasazi. Survey of a portion of the region to be strip-mined added 72 Navajo and Anasazi sites to the inventory on northeastern Black Mesa. The Anasazi sites range from approximately A.D. 600 to A.D. 1200. A late Pueblo I-early Pueblo II settlement was ex- cavated on the north edge of the Mesa, which comprises several surface rooms composed partially of jacal and partially of masonry. A kiva, pit house, 'and surface storage rooms are associated with the surface habitation units. The remaining Anasazi sites date in the A.D. 1050-1200 range and, for the most part, consist of several masonry rooms with contiguous jacal structures, a kiva, and a sub-surface mealing room to the northeast of the kiva. Two sites consist solely of jacal structures and a kiva. As an adjunct to the Black Mesa project, Albert Ward of Prescott College excavated five sites along Moenkopi Wash, on the westernmost edge of Black Mesa, and in the right-of-way of the coal slurry pipe- line. The Research Section, Navajo Parks and Recrea- tion, of the Navajo Tribe has published the revised edition of Navajo bibliography with subject index. Volume I of the bibliography consists of references pertaining to the Navajo Indians, their land and en- vironment, archaeology, culture, and history. The two-volume publication may be purchased from the Navajo Tribal Museum, Window Rock. The Research Section is currently preparing Volume I of a documentary history of the Navajo Indians. Titled Through white-men's eyes, a contri- bution to Navajo History, since all of the documents extant were written by non-Indians and thus present basically only the white-man's view, Volume I ends with the Treaty of June 1, 1868. Volume II continues from 1868. The Museum of Northern Arizona independently conducted four excavations in 1969. Rabbit Hill Vil- lage, NA9,577, located just east of Winslow, is a Basketmaker III-Pueblo I village, one of the few in the area, consisting of 15 pit houses, four burials, and numerous other storage and fire features. Excavations at NA10,533, located south of Winslow, indicate a lithic workshop that yielded 87 recognizable artifacts preliminarily assigned to the Tolchaco phase. The site consists of a shallow scatter of lithic debris, including the basal fragment of a Clovis point and an incomplete Pinto-like point, with no evidence of cultural strati- graphy or residential structures. The third project was the salvage excavation of two sites near Toyei, in Steamboat Wash along a waterline right-of-way. At NA10,587, a burial in a trash deposit and an outside work area with a firepit were found. At NA10,689, two additional groups of unmodified, unburned rocks were found in a small cylindrical pit; just south of Springerville, at the Milligan Valley site, NA10,705, a Mogollon brush shelter was excavated. The Center for Anthropological Studies at Prescott College is expanding its ethnobiology comparative col- lections in order to better facilitate identification of materials from sites excavated by the Prescott College Archaeological Survey as well as materials excavated by other institutions. The nucleus of our Ethno- biology Laboratory is the Lyndon Lane Hargrave Col- lection. This collection is the most complete com- parative collection of its type of avian comparative material in North America. Other vertebrate col- lections, especially mammals, under the supervision of Charles L. Douglas, have been improved. A com- parative botanical collection is being enlarged under the direction of R. Roy Johnson. Special collections include a feather library of detached feathers, a hair slide reference collection, and a reference seed col- lection. Current projects being conducted by Lyndon Har- grave include identification of bird bones recovered by Prescott College anthropologists from Stantons Cave and identification of bird bones from the V-I-V site located in Tonto Basin. During 1969, Hargrave com- pleted work on ethno-biological materials which will result in the naming of a new macaw and a new turkey from archaeological remains. Charles Douglas is identi- fying the mammal remains recovered on Black Mesa by the Prescott College Archaeological Survey as well as the mammals from Stantons Cave. In addition, Douglas is conducting a faunal analysis of Baker Cave, Val Verde Co., Texas, and an analysis of hair from Gran Quivira. The Arizona State University Field School con- ducted the third season of investigations in the Vosberg district near Young. Thirty-six students attended the eight-week session taught by Alfred E. Dittert. A detailed site cultural inventory of the dis- trict was completed. This study revealed cultural remains dating from A.D. 600 to A.D. 1250 and A.D. 1300 to A.D. 1385, as well as historic sites. Problems include studies of agricultural systems, a contrast of the use of floor space at two points in time, and the development of burial patterns. 507</page><page sequence="3">508 american antiquity Members of the Southwest Archaeological Expedi- tion carried forward research both at the Field Museum of Natural History and at the Museum- Expedition's Vernon field station. At the Museum, Fred T. Plog (University of Chicago) completed his dissertation on the subject of An approach to the study of prehistoric change. The monograph deals with an explanation for the transition from Basket- maker culture to Pueblo culture. At Vernon, Plog focused his research on hydraulic systems. Several main ditches and lateral ones were located in the valley. The earliest radiocarbon sample date is A.D. 930?85 (GX-1661), and the latest A.D. 1405?95 (GX-1652). Ezra B. W. Zubrow (University of Arizona) com- pleted his master's thesis on the subiect of Population, contact, and climate in the New Mexican Pueblos.:. Mark Leone was concerned with modern cultural patterns in east-central Arizona. He studied particu- larly: (1) patterns of endogamy as related to economic stability; and (2) autonomy and self-sufficiency. His work was done with public records in Holbrook and St. Johns, county seats in Arizona. Twelve students were chosen as undergraduate participants in a National Science Foundation pro- gram. They spent ten weeks at Vernon. Each student conceived a hypothesis that could be tested with data from archives or which the student could collect during the summer. Richard Hevly and Paul Martin (Field Museum of Natural History) are investigating pollen analysis on sites in the Hay Hollow Valley near Snowflake. The studies reveal that environmental fluctuations closely parallel demographic records from east-central Arizona. The analyses provide possible clues for florescence of Pueblo cultures in the tenth century, and the abandonment of certain areas between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. R. Gwinn Vivian (Arizona State Museum) super- vised Arizona Highway Salvage excavations in five sites near Pinedale and Clay Springs; three contained architectural features and were completely excavated. Similar masonry structures were present at two of the sites, the Turkey Track site and the Aunt Lottie site. Other features at these sites include stone piles (function unknown) and outside hearths. The Aunt Lottie site was a two-level, pit house village built into a hillside with three pit houses upslope and one pit house and a large work area below. The pit houses were basically square and averaged slightly over 3 m. on a side. Central hearths were found in all houses; mealing bins were located in two. The predominant black-on-white type tentatively has been identified as a variety of Snowflake. Prescott College tested the Reef site, 13 mi. south of Ehrenberg, with the sponsorship of the Lower Colorado Office of the Bureau of Land Management. The site produced Mojave Indian pottery as well as a few sherds of glass and china in direct association with the Indian ceramics. Laurens Hammack directed Arizona State Museum Highway Salvage excavations of a platform mound and adjacent features at the Hohokam site of Las Colinas west of downtown Phoenix. Excavation of the mound revealed an artificial platform standing just over seven ft. high. It was almost square (approximately 100 ft. [Vol. 35, No. 4, 1970 by 90 ft.) and was enclosed by a massive adobe wall that was an integral part of the building. The entire structure was capped with clay that sloped down to and was anchored to the massive encircling wall. Evidence for two resurfacings of the adobe capping was present, but construction of a modern house on the mound had destroyed evidence for prehistoric mound-top structures. Three house types were present at the site. The oldest houses are contemporaneous with the building of the mound. A group of five, rectangular adobe rooms on the west side of the mound were identified, on the basis of ceramics, as dating somewhat later than the first type. The most recent dwellings at the site were semisubterranean pit houses located to the north and west of the mound and on the top and sides of the mound. Sixteen inhumations and six cremations were recovered. Pre- liminary ceramic analysis has determined that both the Soho phase, A.D. 1150-1300, and the Civano phase, A.D. 1300-1450, are represented at that portion of Las Colinas that was excavated. A field technique class at Arizona State University, directed by Alfred E. Dittert completed excavations at Ariz. U:9:100 (ASU). Occupation of the site extended over the period from A.D. 1000 to at least A.D. 1430. The earliest remains were characteristic of the Sacaton phase; the latest consisted of jacal structures and rec- tangular shaft graves. Laurens Hammack directed salvage excavations at a site in the San Pedro Valley near Redington. Several components were present at this ridge-top site. The most recent, represented by surface hearths and plain- ware sherds, tentatively was identified as Sobaipuri. The major portion of the ridge was covered by three room blocks with connecting compound walls. This component was identified as Salado. Hearths, outside work areas, and adobe puddling pits were located in the plazas between room blocks. Ceramics associated with this component included Gila and Tucson poly- chromes. A series of pit houses found directly beneath the room blocks and compound plazas tentatively has been assigned to the early Tucson phase or the late Tanque Verde phase, A.D. 1300-1400. Pottery associated with these structures includes Gila Poly- chrome and limited amounts of Tanque Verde Red-on- Brown. An even earlier occupation at the site is represented by two caches of Rincon Red-on-Brown and Rillito Red-on-Brown, sherds of Colonial types from the Gila Basin, and sherds of early Dragoon series pottery. Julian D. Hayden (Research Associate, Arizona State Museum) with Stephen D. Hayden, made a brief resurvey of the ridges and terraces below Ventana Cave. Many stone tools of all time periods were col- lected; especially interesting were a number of choppers of the San Dieguito complex, Phase I, which rounded out the tool inventory of the volcanic debris layer in the cave, in which choppers were scarce. Cairns and sleeping circles of the same phase were also found. Paul Damon and Austin Long, with Bruce Harrill (all of the University of Arizona), and Hayden, collected charcoal and carbonate samples from the volcanic debris layer for radiocarbon dating, to check and refine an earlier date of 9350 B.C.?1200. An adequate bone fragment sample was collected from</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH the lowest, conglomerate, layer. A remnant block of volcanic debris, left by Hayden in 1942, yielded large portions of the lower jaws of two extinct horses. Hayden's survey and study of this region is con- tinuing, in a thus far unsuccessful effort to find evidence contradicting his hypotheses about the occu- pations of the area. Excavations were continued at the Murray Springs Clovis site. More bison skeletons were found as well as some bones of a horse that may be part of the same animal found last year. Numerous depressions in the western part of the site are smaller than the mammoth tracks and are believed to have been made by bison or possibly horses. Tools found in these areas include two broken Clovis points, a blade, and two fluted bifaces. Ancient channel sand was found to extend up the sloping banks of an ancient stream and to contain more mammoth-track depressions in and around a much larger and deeper depression within the channel. These features indicate that the spring run was not flowing, and the most logical explanation for the large depression and channel sand upslope is a water hole dug by an animal, probably mammoth. Geological investigations this year included the ex- cavation and mapping of 530 m. of additional backhoe trenches as well as the continuation of geologic mapping on low altitude aerial photographs provided by the U.S. Army Combat Surveillance School at Fort. Huachuca. In the course of extending a stratigraphic trench to the north numerous teeth of horse, bison, camel, and mammoth were encountered in a coarse sand under- lying the black mat at a depth of 2 m. to 3 m. below the present surface. The sorting, rounding and polish exhibited by the sand as well as its localized horizontal extent, indicate that it is the conduit of an ancient spring in which only the teeth of trapped animals survived the grinding and polishing action of the roiling spring discharge. The assistant director of the Murray Springs Project and foreman of the excavations since 1966, E. T. Hemmings, is completing his dissertation on the archaeology of the Murray Springs site at the Univer- sity of Arizona. Vance Haynes, director of the project, will publish a report on the geology of the site jointly with Hemmings. Archaeological and geological work was supported by the National Geographic Society and the National Science Foundation respectively in grants to Haynes. NEW MEXICO. Leland Abel, National Park Service archaeologist stationed at the Bureau of Indian Affairs Navajo Area Office, Gallup, reports for 1969 that 440 field checks were made on Indian lands in Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado to determine if archae- ological sites might be threatened by proposed con- struction activities. Sites were salvaged by various institutions before the start of construction if alter- native construction locations could not be found. Working in liaison with the State Planning Office, the Museum of New Mexico undertook a site eval- uation study under a grant from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Working from over 11,000 sites in the Museum's survey records, Stewart Peckham and Gail Tierney narrowed the inventory down to 40 sites which have been recommended for listing in the National Register of significant archae- ological sites; five of these sites have been proposed for development as educational exhibits. C. Irwin-Williams (Eastern New Mexico University) carried out the fifth and final field season on Anasazi Origins in the northern Southwest. Activities con- tinued to be centered principally in the Arroyo Cuervo region northwest of Albuquerque and concentrated on enlarging the amount of available information on the material culture, economy, and settlement pattern of the preceramic Oshara tradition between 6000 B.C. and A.D. 500 (Basketmaker II). Excavations were carried out at four localities: Mosca Dunes, a summer gathering site producing materials from about 500 B.C. to about A.D. 500; Westover and Tompsets' Shelters, winter camps occupied between about 500 B.C. and A.D. 500; and Collier Dunes, a large stratified site occupied about 3500 B.C. to about 200 B.C. In addition, work continued at Cochise localities near Laguna Pueblo in order to provide comparative data on Cochise of the southern Southwest and Oshara of the northern Southwest. The stratified Moquino locality produced materials dating between about 2500 B.C. to about A.D. 1; the economically specializ- ed Jackpile locality was evidently occupied between 300 B.C. and A.D. 1. Finally, C. Irwin-Williams and M. Wimberley initiated research in the Tularosa Valley near Alamogordo, focused on very early agricultural developments in the area. Excavations at the well- preserved Fresnel Canyon shelter produced evidence of the use of two kinds of maize, beans, and squash as early as about 1500 B.C. Associated cultural materials appeared initially to be distinct from those of the Cochise culture to the west and may well relate to contemporary developments in adjacent portions of northern Mexico. Museum of New Mexico highway salvage excava- tions in the fall of 1969 concentrated on two early pit house sites and several preceramic sites along New Mexico Highway 44 between Zia and Santa Ana Pueblos. Work was done under the direction of J. W. Allen assisted by David Kayser. The archaic period sites are situated on still active sand dunes on ridges overlooking the Jemez River valley. Fire-cracked rock, one-hand manos, broken projectile points, chipped tools, and lithic debris characterized the sites as they are exposed around the edges of the dunes. No depth has been found at any of these sites. The smaller of the two ceramic period sites was composed of a single D-shaped pit house, 4.5 m. in diameter and 1.75 m. deep, and bearing internal fea- tures typical of Rio Grande pit houses. Nine structures were excavated at the larger pit house site. Most of the pit houses were slightly D- shaped, flattened on the side toward the ventilator, 3.5 m. to 4.5 m. in diameter, with four-post roof support systems and an east-to-west alignment of hearth, ash pit, ladder holes, and ventilator. Sub-floor cists were common. Pit houses ranged from 1.0 m. or less to 2.5 m. deep. One structure, a circular pit house 8.0 m. in diameter and 2.5 m. deep, is important. Its only fea- ture was an easterly oriented ventilator with two vertical shafts to ground level, either of which might have been used as an entryway. The structure is of exceptional size compared to other Rio Grande sub- terranean structures of the same period. On the basis 509</page><page sequence="5">510 of pottery and house construction the village is regard- ed as dating during late Basketmaker III and well into Pueblo I. The California City Development Corporation con- tracted with the Museum of New Mexico to conduct an archaeological survey of approximately 6,550 acres of Cochiti Pueblo land adjacent to the proposed Cochiti Reservoir. The purpose of the study was to locate sites that may be endangered by the develop- ment of residential areas close to the reservoir. Sixty- five sites were recorded, of which 46 were lithic chipping areas apparently used from Archaic to Historic times. Fifteen sites represent late Pueblo III units of single, small, linear house blocks separated by as little as 25 m. and up to 300 m. The units contained from two to ten rooms; and the predominant pottery type is Santa Fe Black-on-White. The field work was conducted by David H. Snow. Arizona State University continued the analysis of Gran Quivira skeletons and cremations, and the col- lection and description of living Hopi and Hopi-Tewa dentitions. Skeltal differences are now discernable with certainty on a statistical basis between Eastern and Western Pueblo Indian divisions. Further analysis within and between these Southwestern divisions con- tinues by Christy G. Turner. The use of archaeologi- cally-derived human skeletons for studies in biological admixture currently receives major attention. The excavation of a single large barracks at Fort Sumner, a 19th-century military post in east-central New Mexico, was begun by the Museum of New Mexico and completed in the summer of 1969. Clear- ance of a latrine there provided a good sample of bottles. bullets, small buttons, other artifacts, and animal bones, all from the 1860's. A walled cellar, perhaps a storage room, dates from the post-1870 ranch period. Field work is under the direction of John P. Wilson, and is part of the Museum's plan to develop the site as a State Monument. The report by S. J. Olsen (Florida State University) entitled An osteology of birds for the archaeologist is near completion. Under the direction of George Agogino and Robert Weber, Eastern New Mexico University completed the last of four seasons at Mockingbird Gap, a large Clovis site located near Trinity Atomic Bomb site. Mike Kunz, field foreman of the project, continued ex- cavation in this region, which yielded more than 150 whole or fragmentary Clovis points and associated tools. On, or near the surface, modern Pueblo and Comanche material was found to overlie a' series of Archaic sites, below which existed a Cody complex overlying the Clovis culture. An ecological project at the Blackwater Draw site is being directed by Alberto Isaquilla. Mike Kunz excavated Agogino Cave, near Fort Stanton. His investigations to date indicate a series of cultures ranging from modern Apache to an Archaic level, similar to Bat Cave, of approximately 5,000 years ago. Students from Eastern New Mexico University and the University of Wisconsin are cooperating on survey and preliminary research of a series of caves in the Guadalupe Mountains. TEXAS. Under an agreement with the El Paso Natural Gas Co., a total of 147 mi. of pipeline right-of- [Vol. 35, No. 4, 1970 way was surveyed by the El Paso Archaeological Society, in El Paso and Hudsbeth counties. Twelve fire hearth sites, three trash or storage pits, one possible habitation pit, and two village sites were located. One six-room village complex assignable to the El Paso phase of the Jornada branch of the Mogollon was cut in half by the pipeline trench, which necessitated excavation of four of the rooms. Ground stone arti- facts recovered included four metates and an intricately carved stone resembling a fish. A salvage and survey project directed by Vernon Brook was conducted on 12 prehistoric sites located on private land near El Paso, where the owner was laying a 10 mi. water pipeline. Most of the sites were typical "blow out" sites, but artifact assemblages from two were diagnostic of a Brown ware culture possibly of the Hueco phase. One Brown ware site yielded two complete and three fragments of hand metates which have not been recognized previously as occurring east of the Rio Grande. The hand metates were directly associated with a rocklined fire hearth. Pottery of the second Brown ware site included El Paso Brown, Alma Plain, and Jornada Brown. The El Paso Society continued excavation of an El Paso phase village located in the "manuevers area" of Ft. Bliss Military Reservation. Military manuevers and natural erosion revealed the outlines of floors, walls, and plazas, and subsequently 17 rooms were mapped, eight of which were excavated. The Sabina Mountain site, located in El Paso County, was deeded to the State of Texas by Horizon Land Corporation for preservation and development by the Tigua Indians. This El Paso phase (ca. A.D. 1300) site was excavated by the El Paso Society from 1963 to 1968, under the direction of Vernon Brook. Plans for the site include construction of a museum on the premises, reconstruction of a "typical" room, and fencing of the area which contains 20 acres. This work is to be done by the Tigua Indians under the super- vision of the El Paso Society. A cave shelter site with both prehistoric and historic components was excavated under the direc- tion of John Green. Efforts to curb vandalism at sites on the Ft. Bliss Military Reservation were made by the Society and the National Park Service during the year. Three students at Florida State University are pre- paring articulated and disarticulated fish skeletons from the Gulf of Mexico relative to analysis of Gulf Coast sites. ALEXANDER J. LINDSAY, JR. EASTERN MESOAMERICA TABASCO. During the summer and fall of 1968, Edward B. Sisson (Harvard University) conducted a program of archaeological research in the north- western Chontalpa, Tabasco, Mexico. for the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia. Sisson was assisted by R. Barry Lewis and Penny R. Sisson. Analysis of the material recovered was begun in the field and has continued in Cambridge through 1969 and into 1970. Most of the 103 sites surveyed were located in the area bounded on the south by the Carretera Circuito del Golfo, on the north by the Gulf of Mexico, on the west by a line through the site of La ameRican antiquity</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEA R CH Venta, and on the east by the Carretera de la Chontalpa. Six sites were selected for testing by 2 m.-square pits and short trenches. In addition, 47 sites were tentatively identified on topographic maps supplied by Ing. Carlos Molina R. of the Grijalva Commission of the Secretaria de Recursos Hidraulicos. Five Preclassic phases have been defined for the northwestern Chontalpa. The earliest, the Molina phase (found at eight sites), has its closest ceramic ties with the Bajio and Chicharras phases at San Lorenzo Tenochtitlan, Veracruz, which M. Coe has dated to between 1350 B.C. and 1150 B.C. There may be a break between the Molina phase and the next identified Chontalpa phase, Palacios (11 sites), which has been dated to between 1050 B.C. and 900 B.C. Only at San Felipe did a few sherds of Calzadas Carved and Tatagapa Red (types most typical of the San Lorenzo or Climax Olmec phase) occur stratigraph- ically below typical Palacios phase material; it should be noted, however, that excavations were made at only six of the 30 Chontalpa sites showing an Early or Middle Preclassic occupation. The long Puente phase (11 sites) which follows is dated between 900 B.C. and 500 B.C. but will be subdivided. Construction of small, planned groups of large mounds began during the Puente phase or the earlier Palacios phase. The succeeding Franco phase (9 sites) is dated between 500 B.C. and 300 B.C. The final Preclassic phase, Castafieda (6 sites), has form modes that are typically Late Preclassic, though waxy wares occur as trade pieces, possibly from the Laguna de Mecoacan area where they are common. CAMPECHE. Operating under a grant from the National Geographic Society, the new program of study which was begun during 1968 and 1969 in the Rio Bec area of southwestern Campeche was con- tinued in 1970. After two years of reconnaissance, Xpuhil was picked by the project director, E. Wyllys Andrews, as a base camp. Studies were then made at Becan, Xpuhil, Payan, and Hormiguero, all sites visited but not excavated by the Carnegie Campeche expedi- tions of the 1930's, and at Kilometer 143, Puerto Rico, Xpuhil 2, Xpuhil 3, El Chorro, and several un-named sites; all of these ruins are within a 12-mile radius of the base camp. Excavations were begun by the Tulane-National Geographic Society group at Becan by extensive test- pitting. These tests established an uninterrupted ceramic sequence from the Middle Formative through the Decadent periods, a time span of approximately 2,000 years. A sequence of architectural styles is obvious but remains to be connected with the ceramic column. Work was begun at one of the larger cere- monial structures so characteristic of Becan. This structure contains, among other things, a five-story palace. Large middens in two rear rooms yielded arti- facts indicating a long "post-ceremonial" use of the structure. Excavations are continuing. The Rio Bec area project had a 1969 staff con- sisting of Andrews as director and Jack Eaton as engineer, assisted by Michael and Ellin Simmons (ceramics), Prentice Thomas and Newell Wright (Ford Fellowship assistants. Tulane), and Eduardo Toro (lab technician). During parts of the season the project was also assisted by Ian Graham who helped record two new dated stelae from El Chorro, George Stuart who helped in architectural drawing, and Gordon Gahan, National Geographic staff photographer. Field work was recommenced in 1970 with an enlarged staff ex- cavating and consolidating at two sites. Richard E. Adams (University of Minnesota) is acting as Field Director at Becan, and Jack Eaton is Field Director at "Km. 143." Ingolf Vogeler of Minnesota is studying the cultural ecology of the area, with Herb Wright and William Watts spending parts of the season on paleo- limnology and current botany. Joseph Ball of Wisconsin plans to devote three years to the project to work out the ceramic sequence. The project hopes to obtain a good estimate of the population potential of the area and its historical utilization this season, and eventually to be able to evaluate the relationship of the "Puuc-Chenes-Rio Bec" architectural tradition to that of the Peten. In northern Campeche, the BYU-New World Archaeological Foundation under the direction of Ray T. Matheny terminated a mapping and test pitting project during 1969. The principal sites investigated were Santa Rosa Xtampak and Dzibilnohac, both in the Municipio of Hopelchen. At the former site, Richard B. Stamps made a detailed study and photo- graphic record, and amplified the existing Brainard- Roys-Ruppert map. An inventory was compiled of damage suffered by the vaulted structures. Santa Rosa Xtampak is notable for its underground water storage facilities in addition to unusually well preserved architecture and compact ceremonial com- plexes. Explorations by Evan I. DeBloois located 67 chultuns, and others must exist. Wherever entrance diameters permitted entry, the chultuns'interiors were examined, and a number were explored further by test pits excavated in their floors or surface areas. An attempt was made to determine use, contents, method of construction, and chronology of the chultuns. Most of the examined chultuns were roughly hemispherical chambers dug into the limestone bedrock, with flattish bottoms. Any faults in the bedrock were masonry- filled. The entire interior was then coated with up to three very thick coats of plaster; plaster floor sections were as much as 40 cm. thick. Approximate capacities of the chultuns ranged from 1,800 to 23,000 gallons, with an average of about 11,000 gallons (41,500 liters). Use of the chultuns as cisterns seems unques- tionable, viewing their mode of construction, setting, and the absence of surface water at the site. Excavations made within and near the Santa Rosa Xtampack chultuns evidence several reconstruction phases, with three or more plaster floors typically found sloping toward the openings. The earliest of such floor series may be Middle Preclassic, while sub- sequent floorings characteristically appear to be Late Preclassic and Late Classic (no Early Classic occu- pation was identified). The chultuns are most abundant in peripheral zones of the site, usually placed in plaza or terrace situations where drainage is favored. Entrances were typically narrow and neck- like, their depth varying from zero to 2.5 m. according to the amount of soil accumulated above bedrock. The analysis of materials recovered from these cisterms and their vicinities is now well advanced and will be in- cluded in a general study of the Chenes ecosystem. 511</page><page sequence="7">512 At Dzibilnohac, 20 mi. south of Santa Rosa Xtampak, Fred Nelson completed the brief BYU- NWAF program of ceramic recovery and structural plotting begun the previous year. There are only three chultuns located at Dzibilnohac, where water needs must have been satisfied by the 19 wells so far identi- fied. One of the discovered chultuns is double chambered and constructed in a high area of bedrock. This chultun contained Preclassic pottery and was covered over by 2 m. of platform fill; it suggests both in form and probable function the "food storage" chultuns of Tikal, postulated by Puleston to have been for deposits of breadnuts (fruit of the ramon tree). Ceramics recovered from 20 test pits dug at Dzibilnohac are being studied by Nelson and Matheny. Preliminary results indicate that there were heavy Late Preclassic and Late Classic occupations, with related ceremonial and habitational architecture abundant for both periods. There is little recognized evidence of the Middle Formative period reported by Brainard to be well represented at the site. A new project was begun at Edzna, Campeche, in December under the direction of Roman Pifia Chan of the Museo Nacional de Antropologia. The Mexican and state governments are facilitating architectural consolidation both here and at Becan. YUCATAN. No summary of the National Geo- graphic Society-Tulane University program of research on the Yucatan Peninsula has been submitted to Current Research for some time, but the project has not been moribund. Analysis of the Dzibilchaltun material and its preparation for publication have con- tinued in the Merida laboratory and at various insti- tutions. A description of the Formative pottery has been completed by Leroy Joesink-Mandeville. Final study of the later pottery is being done by Michael Simmons during 1970. The skeletal material has been described by T. Dale Stewart. The animal remains are being written up by Elizabeth Wing. The numerous molluscan remains were described by the project director, E. Wyllys Andrews, which led to a general ecological study of their use and distribution in a book now in press at Tulane. A detailed map of the 22 square km. composing Dzibilchaltun was completed and has been given preliminary distribution. The more than 8,000 structures on the map are being analyzed in terms of population and settlement patterns by Edward Kurjack. These final steps were financed by a supplementary grant from the National Science Foundation. Sections on architecture, artifacts, tombs and caches, and a general synthesis are in varying stages of completion. Peripheral investigations under the Tulane program included excavations at Ikil, the caves of Chac and Balankanche, and a late Formative midden at Cancun on the Quintana Roo coast. The Ikil and Chac reports have been published; the Balankanche book is in press; and the report on the Cancun excavation has been completed. Jack D. Eaton, under a grant from the American Philosophical Society, spent ten months of 1968 in an archaeological reconnaissance of the west and north coasts of the Yucatan Peninsula, from the Laguna de Terminos, Campeche, to Cabo Catoche, Quintana Roo. He visited and test-pitted more than 50 sites, [Vol. 35, No. 4, 1970 mostly unreported previously. Analysis of the artifacts and animal material obtained from this survey is con- tinuing, and a few most interesting facts have emerged. Large parts of this area were quite densely populated in ancient times-apparently most heavily in the Forma- tive period. No remains, however, were found which Andrews and Eaton have any reason to believe pre- dated the Dzibilchaltun Zacnicte Formative. A particularly interesting result of the coastal survey is the almost conclusive indications that a narrow sandbar, which now holds virtually all of the ports and modern settlements as well as the coconut plantations, was formed much more recently than has been believed and is probably datable archaeologically. All of the Formative and Early Period sites occur well behind the sandbar in swamp areas which would be virtually uninhabitable today. The Formative middens, which are almost continuous, are formed of heavy accumulations of large mollusc shells (Strombus, Busycon, Pleuroploca, Turbinella). Early Period occu- pation sites, less abundant, are similarly located well back from the coast, usually on bits of high ground in the swamp. Two Modified Florescent sites are located on an offshore islet and on the oceanside rim of the swamp. On the coastal sandbar itself, there is no trace of occupation before Decadent Period times.' The coastal pyramid of El Cuyo is definitely of this period, as are all of the frequent sherds found in the tidal wash of the area. The coastal conformations of northern Yucatan and Quintana Roo and consequent human settlement patterns thus seem to have been radically altered between the ninth and thirteenth centuries A.D., stabilizing out in their present form only in the last centuries before the Spanish Conquest. At X-Kukican, near Oxkutzcab in southern Yucatan, the University of Alabama field team headed by David L. DeJarnette continued its program of topo- graphic mapping, excavation, and cave exploration. By the end of the season, more than 150 individual build- ings had been plotted on the site map, a number of caches had been excavated, and six small domestic ruins with a series of non-vaulted room structures had been investigated in detail. A group of students of Alberto Barrera Vasquez from the Instituto Yucateco de Antropologia e Historia supervised the excavation and stabilization of four recently encountered pure Florescent vaulted buildings at X-Kukican. The latter are 3-roomed structures 12-15 m. long with collapsed vaults. Also investigated during 1969 were a number of chultuns and a series of caves showing use during the Early Classic (Early Period) until possibly Flores- cent or Transitional times. A few caves appeared intact and worthy of careful future investigation. BRITISH HONDURAS. The Royal Ontario Museum Altun Ha Expedition under the direction of David M. Pendergast completed its investigations of major structures in the site's central precinct in 1969. The data collected during the season indicate that there was fairly large scale construction activity at the site-center in Late Preclassic times. During 1970 attempts are being made to locate range-type buildings and other structures belonging to this early period. Major 1970 efforts, however, are being devoted to testing the outlying zones of Altun Ha, involving both residential and ceremonial structures. The initial weeks ameRican antiquity</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH of the new season produced numerous burials, pri- marily of Late Classic date, plus details of an apparently Protoclassic structure with multiple offer- ings. The latter include a nest of jawless skulls and complex internal features not previously encountered. It is planned that excavations will close in June, 1970, and that 1971 will be devoted to the analysis of recovered materials at the field camp. A guidebook to the ruins of Altun Ha was recently published by the Museum. GUATEMALA. The second and final season of excavation at Monte Alto on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala commenced in December, 1969. The pro- ject, led by Lee A. Parsons (Harvard University) with Edwin M. Shook continuing as field director, is being financed by the National Geographic Society. Assist- ing this year are Timothy Nowak and Richard Rose (Harvard University), Gene Paull (University of Arizona), and Ken Jacobsen (University of Washing- ton). Although the stratigraphy has not yet been analyzed in detail, Monte Alto appears primarily to be a Preclassic site with heavy occupation during the Middle and Late Preclassic periods. The site apparently was occupied, however, from the Early Preclassic through the Late Classic. By the close of the 1969 season, 11 monumental boulder sculptures were known at Monte Alto-five colossal stone heads, five massive human effigy boulders, and one feline monster head-the style of which is peculiar to the Pacific Coast region and yet seems somewhat Olmec-related. The only evidence at hand suggests that the final placement of the monuments was contemporary with the Providencia- Sacatepequez phase at Kaminaljuyu. Also located at Monte Alto are 12 plain stone stelae, a group of which is positioned to the east of a high mound and suggests the function of sighting the solstices and equinoxes in Late Preclassic times. An interesting architectural com- plex is a system of stone drains constructed of cobbles calked with clay. Additional extensive sampling is being undertaken at the site, which includes over 40 substantial earthen mounds. Materials excavated at a Postclassic domestic site on Lake Macanche, Pet6n, are being analyzed by William R. Bullard, Jr. The purpose of this study has been to establish a chronological framework for the Peten Postclassic and to link findings that Bullard had made previously at Topoxte, Lake Yaxha, with what was known from Lake Pet6n. In the central Guatemalan highlands, the Kaminal- juyu Project of the Pennsylvania State University is in its third year, directed by William T. Sanders.This major investigation of one of Mesoamerica's largest and most important sites is being funded principally by the National Science Foundation. The on-going research is providing new and badly needed insights into the problems of civic planning and other social processes. The Kaminaljuyu excavations and analyses are revealing details of both a remarkable internal development and the consequences of strong external contact with the unique Teotihuacan urban center on the Central Mexican plateau. CHIAPAS. During the past year, a large milk- processing plant has been erected on the Chiapa de Corzo mound site. Most of the affected mounds were small and sacrificed to the bulldozers, but when the larger Mound 17 was threatened, the Museo Regional de Chiapas had operations halted briefly to permit urgent salvage. The Nestle Corporation thereupon pro- vided minimal funds for a labor crew and Thomas A. Lee, Jr., on behalf of the BYU-New World Archae- ological Foundation undertook to rescue the essential data as the mound came apart. The mound was about 6 m. high and 50 m. across its base, and had been briefly tested by D. Brockington in 1959, revealing two pottery caches and an exterior cut-stone wall, all dating to the Horcones or "Early Protoclassic" (Chiapa VI) phase. The 1969 investigations of Lee recovered a series of superimposed constructions ex- tending from the Horcones phase back to the Escalera (Chiapa III) phase. Underlying and surrounding the mound was extensive Dili (Chiapa II) phase refuse for which neither recovery time nor facilities were pro- vided. The original Escalera construction stage in Mound 17 was represented by three overlaid clay platform floors for which no exterior features were identified. Associated with the stage, however, was a cist-type burial with an offering which included a set of minia- ture vessels, two of which are of polished black fine- grained stone (one a reclining monkey effigy) and two others are small tecomates or neckless jars of alabaster. Overlying the above was a large platform formed by six terraces, which dated to the late Francesa (Chiapa IV) phase. This basal structure had a wide frontal stairway with broad sloping balustrades and was about 4 m. high. The summit surface had been refloored once and supported a low secondary platform or temple base. Construction was of rammed earth with a pounded caliche surface, similar to the San Agustin platform east of Tuxtla Gutierrez earlier reported by Navarrete. Associated with this Francesa stage in Mound 17 were many burials and offerings. The most spectacular burial included three individuals and furniture including the following: a jade-beaded belt and pubic cover; jade and she bead anklets, wristlets, kneebands, and armbands; a small pearl necklace; jade mosaic earflares; incised bivalve shell mouth cover; and nine pottery vessels, including a basket-handle spouted jar. The eroded upper and outer structural remnants of Mound 17 are apparently all of the Horcones phase, with no typical artifacts of the intervening Guanacaste (Chiapa V) phase encountered. At the Maya ruins of Chinkultic in the Chiapas highlands near Comitan, a group of enthusiasts affiliated with the Milwaukee Public Museum termi- nated their Agau Azul Cenote investigations during the 1969-70 season. As a result of the tragic death of Stephen Borhegyi in late 1969, the Chinkultic project in 1970 was overseen by Roberto Gallegos of the Instituto Nacional de A ntropologia e Historia and co- sponsored by CEDAM which made some equipment available through Pablo Bush Romero. The water level in the cenote was pulled down over 5 m. below normal level through constant use of two large diesel pumps each with a 6-in. discharge pipeline some 120 m. long. The pumps installation and maintenance were gen- erously provided by Robert Sohnlen of the Beloit Pipe and Dredge Company. Lowering of the Chinkultic cenote water level per- 513</page><page sequence="9">514 mitted excavations in the sloping talus edges around the cenote pond. Within and below the accumulated fallen cliff rock and slime along the south edge of the cenote were found quantities of broken pottery and numerous small offerings. The latter include many obsidian knives and seem to have been submerged within now-shattered ollas or baskets, each of which included a round lime rock apparently intended to sink the offering to the floor of the cenote. Analysis of these recent finds will permit more complete obser- vations on what appears to be a different pattern of "water worship" than has heretofore been noted. It is expected that the cenote materials will be principally studied and reported by the BYU-NWAF in coopera- tion with Vincent Schwartz (Milwaukee Public Museum). Both participated briefly in the latest cenote investigations. A surprising result of the pro- gram already apparent is the large percentage of Late Preclassic and Protoclassic pottery (in the Highland Guatemala tradition) recovered from both the interior and exterior margins of the cenote and adjacent area. During the longer 1969 season at Chinkultic, Pierre Agrinier of the BYU-NWAF conducted clearing and test pitting in the plaza at the foot of the cliff-top Group A "palace" complex. In addition to abundant late incense burner fragments covering the area, portions of two Protoclassic stone monuments were recovered in this operation. At the base of the palace pyramid itself, high above the cenote and overlooking the site, two small tombs or crypt burials were dis- covered, one dating to the Late Classic and the other to the Early Postclassic. The former included in its offering a Maya polychrome jar and the latter several Plumbate vessels. In 1970, Gallegos resumed the palace investigations, encountering additional late tombs whose contents are not yet reported. Restora- tion of the three little tomb platforms and the lower portion of the palace pyramid was also directed by Gallegos, utilizing funds provided by the Milwaukee group. The Chinkultic site map was completed in 1969 by Eduardo Martinez E., BYU-NWAF topographer (with additional structural details added in 1970). The ball court was explored by Carlos Navarrete (associated with the National University) utilizing a BYU-NWAF work crew which also cleared the tremendous acropolis structure rising from the eastern side of the court. This complex measures about 160 m. across in both directions at its base and is over 34 m. high. Previously thought to be a hill, this genuine acropolis shows massive stone masonry walls on all sides and at all levels; only on the northeastern edge does surfacing native rock reveal the presence of a natural limestone eminence under a portion of the platform. The level surface at the summit (about 30 m. above the south forecourt and 45 m. above the surrounding house- mound-studded fields) provides a multi-plaza area measuring approximately 80 m. by 60 m. The summit plazas are flanked by secondary platforms, some of which contain what appear to be looted dedicatory stela cache vaults. The outer slopes of this great structure are damaged almost beyond recognition by natural erosion, centuries of grazing cattle, and milpa cultivation. There are, nevertheless, sufficient intact [Vol. 35, No. 4, 1970 buried sections remaining to permit restoration of this acropolis should funds ever be found equal to the task. GARETH W. LOWE WESTERN MESOAMERICA OAXACA. In July, 1968, Donald Brockington (Un- iversity of North Carolina) with graduate students John Cleary, Maria Jorrin, Rosemary Sharp, and Michael Mitchell (University of Toronto) surveyed in the vicinity of Miahuatlan, 100 km. southwest of Oaxaca City. They located 30 sites and tested four. Ceramic studies during 1968 and 1969 indicate an occupation extending from late Preclassic to present times with a heavy occupancy during Monte Alban Period V. Sherds from stratigraphic deposits indicate that the first occurrence of Period V grey wares-those usually associated with the Mixtec occupation of the Valley of Oaxaca-was contemporaneous with Period IV ceramics, Balancan Fine Orange, and mold-made sherds similar to some of the Late Classic Maya. Higher levels in pits contained two-toned grey Period V sherds and surface finds included Mixtec poly- chrome and numerous Mazapan-style flat figurines with wirework features. It was concluded that a grey- ware ceramic tradition usually associated with the Mixtec occupation of the Valley of Oaxaca was emerg- ing as a distinctive, identifiable unit during the eighth or ninth century A.D. From February through May, 1969, Brockington, Cleary, Jorrin, and Mitchell surveyed and tested on the Oaxacan coast from Pochutla to the Rio Verde finding 62 sites, 24 carved and 37 plain stone monuments, nine petroglyphs and two sets of rock paintings. In addition, 33 stratigraphy pits were excavated in nine sites. Laboratory studies continued until September. The project was supported by the National Science Foundation. Little evidence was foundof an Early Preclassic occupation, perhaps because of recent physical changes in the coastline. From the Middle Preclassic through the Classic, cultures near the Rio Verde pro- duced ceramics rather similar to the Monte Alban tradition. From Bajos de Chila, near Puerto Escon- dido, eastward to at least Pochutla, the typical ceramic from Middle Preclassic into the Classic was a graphite and red, sometimes with orange and white, painted ware known in the Monte Alban sequence as K.5 from Periods I and II and considered intrusive there. This ware vanished as a new tradition appeared in the same region. The new tradition, probably from the western Maya of Tabasco, includes fine-paste monochrome, tall, elegant vases, as well as bowls with low slab supports, Balancan Fine Orange, and some mold-made sherds with representations of Maya-style figures. With and above the Maya-like ceramics were two varieties of a red-on-cream bichrome considered part of the Mixtec ceramic tradition in Oaxaca. The earliest variety, with broad-line painting, was directly associated with Mayoid materials while the later thin- line variety was from surface levels and always associated with Mixtec polychrome. It seems that another segment of the so-called Mixtec ceramic tradi- tion was emerging in coastal Oaxaca during the eight or ninth century A.D. Carved stone monuments include a Bajos de Chila ameRican antiquity</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEAR CH stela showing a well-made anthropomorphic figure holding a rampant serpent and six stelae at Rio Grande. These are similar to Monte Alban examples, but more simple. One shows a jaguar priest holding a human head and a monkey in a subordinate posture. All six bear the glyph 3 Turquoise. The Chila and Rfo Grande stelae have been assigned tentatively to the Early Classic by ceramic associations. Jorrin is doing a stylistic analysis of all known stone monuments from the Oaxacan coast. MICHOACAN. Almost unknown archaeologically is the region of los Valles and Lake Cuitzeo of northeast Michoacan, in spite of it being a region of great im- portance. Its importance is such that recent studies would suggest it be considered an archaeological zone linking the Altiplano Central with west Mexico, and northern Mexico. Its importance derives effectively from its strategic geographical position, particularly if one accepts the existence of a "cultural corridor" that follows the margin of the Lerma-Santiago Rivers. Investigating the possibility of northeast Michoacan in such a role, Jose Arturo Oliveros M. found support in the objective analysis of an important collection of plundered objects which are now housed in the National Museum of Anthropology. The Museum intervened in order that these objects would not be lost in the hands of professional collectors who en- couraged the destruction of many structures and burials in order to obtain their valuable merchandise. The study of this collection showed a series of formal style characteristics, revealing a great time and space extension. This in turn led to field investigations of the area, certain to provide major new facts for a better understanding of prehispanic cultural dynamics. In order to achieve these objectives, surface recon- naissance and stratigraphic text excavations were begun. From these have come the materials whose study will permit us to establish interrelations, and to know with certainty, the significance of this region in the problem of the transition from Late Preclassic to the Classic. JALISCO. Utilizing both archaeological and ethno- historical data, Otto Schondube (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico) has carried out studies in the area of Tamazula-Tuxpan-Zapotlan with the object of describing as much as possible of its cultural back- ground. Other than surface survey, stratigraphic testing and obsidian dating have aided in establishing a chronological ceramic sequence. Written sources of the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries have pro- vided important ethnohistoric documentation. The area according to the earliest accounts was peopled by groups speaking several languages. At least nine different names were given for languages spoken in the area but present knowledge of archaeological materials would indicate that the material culture is more or less the same over the whole area. The area is predominantly a region of red and brown monochrome wares. The bichrome and poly- chrome potteries are meager and restricted to the Postclassic. These painted potteries are closely related to the Autlin and Cojumantlan polychrome types of Kelly and Lister. Most of the sites in the area are of the Early and Late Postclassic period. The time span for the majority of the materials goes from A.D. 750 to A.D. 1400. There are also materials from early periods but they are poorly represented: most of this material consists of fragments of figurines similar to the Ortices-Tuxcacuesco figurines from the so-called Classic period of Colima and the Tuxcacuesco- Zapotitlan zone of Jalisco. A few more fragments closely resemble the figurines found by Noguera in El Opefio, Michoacan, thought to belong to the Middle Preclassic period. The written sources speak of deities such as Tlaloc, Huehueteotl, Xipe, Tonain, and Tono- tiuh. Until now, Sch8ndube has found good archae- ological evidence only for the cult of Tlaloc and Xipe. This much is important in view of the fact that very little is known (other than for the Tarascan area) of the prehispanic religion in western Mexico. The area was chosen for its potential as a place of cultural contacts in that it is one of the few that present a moderately easy communication route be- tween the Chapala Basin of the high plateau and the shores of the Pacific. The ceramic relations appear to be all with neighborhood areas and most of them took place late in time (except the aforementioned figurines with Tuxcacuesco or Opefio affiliations and weaker evidence of late Teotihuacan material represented only by two moldmade head figurines). There is evidence for cultural relations with: the Cojumatlan phase of the Chapala Basin; the Coralillo and Toliman phases of the Tuxcacuesco area; the Chila and Tepetate phases of Apatzingan; and some relations with the materials that came from the archaeological site of El Chanal in the State of Colima. By contrast, it seems that there were no close relations with the late cultures of the very near area of the Sayula-Zacoalco Basin. Evidence of the Tarascan dominion over the area, stated in written sources, is scanty in the archae- ological materials. One explanation is that there was no strong Tarascan authority in the area, or as another hypothesis, they utilized the common ceramic types of the area. The work of Professor R. Pifia Chan at Tzintzun- tzan at the beginning of 1969 was a continuation of the work done in earlier archaeological seasons. The Yacata No. 1 was explored and partially restored so that the construction technique employed by the Tarascans is visible. During the exploration, remnants of a stair leading to the top of the so-called Yacata were found. The big platform on which the five Yacatas of Tzintzuntzan rest was explored and re- stored. The complete size of this platform is now known and it is known also that inside and below the level of the construction of the Yacatas, there are some substructures. Formerly it was supposed that there was an enormous stair leading to the top of the big platform which is on the slope of the Yahuaran Mountain, but the excavation revealed that this is not true, and that the access to the top was by a modified natural extension of the slope which served as a ramp and was interrupted at some places by steps. At Tariacuri Mountain, south of the town of Tzintzun- tzan, exploratory trenches were made at the place known as El Fresno de Santa Ana. The excavation revealed the existence of another enormous platform, similar in size and construction technique (and with substructures) to that already mentioned. During the excavations a multiple burial of two 515</page><page sequence="11">516 skeletons with an extraordinarily rich offering was found near the Yacata No. 2. The principal interest of the offering lies in the variety of the materials: obsidian and rock crystal lip plugs, red obsidian ear plug, gold and copper tweezers, gold, turquoise, amber and jadeite beads, gilded copper bells, miniature pottery vessels, stirrup handled vessels, copper axes, textile fragments, and some other copper instruments, some still with bone and wooden handles. The ceramics are now being studied in order to see if there is a substantial difference between those found in the upper structures, and those in the substructures. COLIMA. Isabel Kelly has continued field research in Colima, with additional surface survey and modest testing in the Armeria Basin and in the Naranjo- Coahuayana drainage of eastern Colima. In the former area, a ceramic complex, long suspected to exist, seems finally to be taking form. Primarily mono- chrome and ceramically rather reminiscent of Tlatilco, it may prove to be the earliest horizon known so far from Colima. Much of the work during the spring of 1969 was focused in east Colima, in the hope of being able to equate local ceramic complexes temporally with those of the Armeria drainage. At present, it appears that this effort had limited success, but sherd material collected in two key areas still has not been unpacked and inspected. SINALOA-NAYARIT. The following summary of studies accomplished between 1966 and 1969, out- lines the work of the archaeological delegation for northwest Mexico of The National Institute of Anthropology and History. Funds have been furnished by various agencies including The Tourism Depart- ment, University of Sinaloa and by governments of The States of Sinaloa and Nayarit and the research has been under the direction of Hector V. Galvez C. 1966-1967. Two field seasons at the site of Siqueros, Sinaloa, were conducted, the first during October and November, 1966, and the second in January and February, 1967. Siqueros is located 43 km. southeast of Mazatlan. In the environs of the village, workmen discovered a small ceremonial center containing a burial. The mortuary offerings consisted of three alabaster vessels, bowls, a necklace of turquoise discs, etc. The workmen, in search of salable artifacts, left behind various fragmented bracelets and rings. The collection was sold to Miguel Valadez who informed the authorities of the discovery. In general terms, the ceremonial center consists of a principal mound of earth and three platforms oriented east-west in the south side of the main mound. The westernmost platform was found to have an "L" shape, the smaller arm oriented toward the north, possibly marking the corner of the plaza. It seems possible that there existed other platforms that en- closed the plaza on the north side but if so, these were destroyed in clearing the fields for cultivation. In the first field season, the principal mound was excavated and 11 primary flexed burials were found there. Accompanying the burials were alabaster vessels (with seven of the burials), ollas and bowls, and neck- laces of turquoise beads (with four burials). Among these objects was found an anthropomorphic vessel of Tohil Plumbate, dating the site within the Postclassic [Vol. 35, No. 4, 1970 horizon. Other vessels showed decoration typical of the Toltec culture. In the second field season, excavations were under- taken in Platform I and II where other burials were found but with a poorer representation of mortuary furnishings. In Platform III, stratigraphic pits were dug. 1968. Ten km. northwest of Culiacan, Sinaloa, is the site of Los Mezcales where brick-kiln constructions resulted in the chance discovery of large quantities of archaeological objects. In some cases, objects were sold to collectors and the discovery of the site was brought to the attention of Roberto Perez Rubio, Director of The Culiacan Museum. A subsequent visit confirmed the presence of a zone of prehistoric burials. Between April and June, five exploratory trenches were dug, producing 33 primary extended burials. Offerings were found arranged around the crania. Cranial deformation and tooth mutilation were found in three individuals. In addition to Aztatlan ceramic types, there were also funerary urns con- taining secondary bundled burials. The site would appear to date within the Postclassic horizon. 1969. At the suggestion of the Governor of Nayarit, Julian Gascon Mercado and with support from the State government, excavations were under- taken during April and June in the area of Lake Mezcaltitan near the Acaponeta River. The first site, named El Quemado, is located 8.5 km. east of Centipac, Nayarit. It was apparently a site of consider- able importance judging by the abundance of earth mounds. Two mounds excavated at El Quemado pro- duced primary extended burials and ceramic objects belonging to the Aztatlan complex. Again, three burials showed dental mutilation. The second site, El Chicoche, is located to the northwest of San Felipe Atatlan in the Municipality of Tecuala. Mound excavations yielded seven primary extended burials with ceramic offerings consisting of simple ollas in red on buff. In addition, Burial Number 4 contained a covered bowl inside of which were 52 figurines bearing a strong stylistic resemblance to those of Chupicuaro, Guanajuato. Carbon samples were collected and the ceramic materials are being analyzed. During 1969, the State University of New York at Buffalo continued its researches in the prehistory and paleoecology of the Marismas Nacionales, an enor- mous estuary and lagoon system in Sinaloa and Nayarit. General archaeological data as well as findings in physical anthropology and ethnozoology are pre- sently being analyzed. GUANAJUATO-SAN LUIS POTOSI. The area that lies between the northern frontier of Mesoamerica of the sixteenth century and the maximum northern frontier (earlier and at a more northerly latitude) has been studied in the State of Tamaulipas by Richard MacNeish; in the States of Zacatecas and Durango by J. Charles Kelley; and in Guanajuato and San Luis Potosiby Beatriz Braniff. According to the limited reconnaissance and exca- vations done in this north-central area, the Meso- american frontier began its expansion into this region at a time which corresponds to the Late Preclassic period, a situation which is paralleled by MacNeish's american antiqulty</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT RESEARCH and Kelley's finds. A very important Classic period followed, and then an Early Postclassic with apparently fewer inhabitants. The area seems to have been deserted by farmers at the end of this Early Postclassic period. To confirm such a hypothesis and expand our meager knowledge of this peripheral area, Ana Maria Crespo and Beatriz Braniff (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico) undertook a small but productive survey and excavation of a site called Electra, near the town of Villa de Reyes in San Luis Potosf. The maximum Mesoamerican frontier is approximately 50 km. north of the site and it was hoped that this extreme geographical position would provide important data as regards the proposed pro- blems. The study of materials collected disclosed the pre- sence of at least five different groups: three prehispanic, one Colonial, and one Modern. The limited excavations revealed five phases. Two cor- respond to a Middle and Late Classic period. Above these is an Early Postclassic-Toltec occupation. Over- lying these phases, but in a still more constricted area, there is evidence of the Colonial and Modern phases. Braniff and Crespo are trying to find a general pattern and reason to account for the oscillation of the life of this village which seems to have attained a special importance at certain times and, at other times, an unexplained decrepitude. STUART D. SCOTT CENTRAL AMERICA EL SALVADOR. Robert J. Sharer (Pitzer College, Claremont, California) has written an extensive pre- liminary report on the 1969 season of the Chalchuapa Archaeological Project. A brief version of this report was read before the 68th Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association. The project itself is sponsored by the University Museum, Univer- sity of Pennsylvania, and is supported by research grants of that institution, Pitzer College, and the Ford Foundation. Project Director is William R. Coe (Uni- versity Museum, Philadelphia), while Sharer is Field Director. Besides them six graduate student field assistants (from the Universities of Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Arizona, as well as Northern Illinois University) and seven undergraduate student trainees (from Pitzer and Pomona Colleges) worked in El Sal- vador. The field season covered the time from January 27 until May 30, 1969. During this time excavations were conducted within the Casa Blanca and El Trapiche Mound groups at Lage Cuzcachapa and at Las Victorias. All are in the Chalchuapa archaeological zone in western El Salvador and probably consist of a single large settlement oc- cupied in its various sections at different periods. At the same time an extensive surface survey and test excavation program was conducted throughout the site area. Of high importance is the new map of the zone with the mounds numbered by a map grid de- signation system. The 1969 excavations confirmed the sequence of ceramic complexes established by Sharer from the 1954 and 1967 excavations in this region, and made a continuation into the Classic and Postclassic periods possible. The dating of these complexes is still through comparison with other known sequences. The list of the complexes reads as follows: Ahal Ceramic complex (Late Postclassic) A.D. 1200-1500 Matzin Ceramic complex (Early Postclassic) A.D. 900-1200 Payu Ceramic complex (Late Classic) A.D. 600-900 Xecco Ceramic complex (Early Classic) A.D. 200-600 Caynac Ceramic complex (Late Preclassic) 300 B.C.-A.D. 200 Chul Ceramic complex (late Middle Preclassic) 500-300 B.C. Kal Ceramic complex (early Middle Preclassic) 800-500 B.C. Coles Ceramic complex (Early Preclassic) 1000-800 B.C. Tok Ceramic complex (Early Preclassic) 1200-1000 B.C. The comparison of the ceramic complexes revealed direct ties between the Tok Ceramic complex and the San Lorenzo phase ceramics of the Olmec core-area site of San Lorenzo and cast new light upon the problem of Olmec civilization. E. Wyllys Andrews, 5th, (graduate student, Tulane University) undertook excavations at Quelepa in eastern El Salvador. The site consists of a band of occupation stretching about %-km. along the Rio San Esteban, running north about 500 m. to the base of some hills. In a paper on these excavations, read before the 68th Annual Meeting of the American Anthro- pological Association, Andrews named the three phases encountered by him and gave a tentative dating as follows: Lepa phase (Late Classic) Shila phase (Early Classic) Uapala phase (Preclassic) NICARAGUA. Parts of the first capital of Nicaragua, Le6n Viejo, is being excavated under the direction of Francisco Villalta with the assistance of the newly-founded Instituto Nicaragiiense de Antro- pologfa y Arqueologia. To date, the ruins of the cathedral and the house of the governor in the northern part of the city, and those of the Iglesia la Merced and the merchant Gonzalo Cano in the south, have been unearthed. Furthermore, the fort (La Fortaleza) has been found on a hill 50 m. high to the east of the actual settlement. Another group of ruins has been discovered about 1 km. northeast of Le6n Viejo. Francisco Villalta thinks that this might be the original settlement of the Imabites, the Indian village of Colonial times. The excavation will be continued under the sponsorship of the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua. The Instituto Nicaragilense de Antropologia y Arqueologia, a society of interested citizens of Nicaragua, was incorporated by presidential decree on June 9, 1969, in Managua, capital of Nicaragua. In the meantime, the first number of its Anales have been published with a general article on Nicaraguan archae- ology by Rafael Girard. COSTA RICA. Since 1963 the Associated Colleges of the Midwest initiated a Central American Field 517</page><page sequence="13">518 Program, the headquarters of which is situated in San Jose de Costa Rica. Part of this program is also con- cerned with archaeology. Besides a number of very useful archaeological bibliographies, one for each country, they initiated a general survey of the petro- glyphs of Costa Rica. The same institution in 1969 initiated an archae- ological survey of northwestern Costa Rica under the field direction of Frederick W. Lange (University of Wisconsin). He was assisted by six undergraduate students from Beloit, Carleton, and Ripon Colleges. The following results of the work, which extended from February 17 to June 1, 1969, are taken from the interim report: The survey concentrated on the north- western corner of Guanacaste province near the Nicaraguan frontier. The objectives pursued in the 1969 field season were: (1) to survey and map mani- festations of pre-Columbian occupation in the Rio Sapoa Valley, including adjacent portions of the Bahia de Salinas; (2) to surface collect and conduct test excavations at sites in a variety of ecological environ- ments and geographical locations; (3) to determine if cultural remains warrant a second season of field work and, if so, to apply the results of the first season toward formulation of plans for the second. The survey yielded 84 sites as follows: (1) 37 open sites, 4 cemeteries, one architectural feature, and one rockshelter in the Rio Sapoa region; (2) 9 open sites and 4 shell mounds in the Bahia de Salinas; (3) 20 open sites, of which 14 were purely lithic, one rock- shelter, 2 cemeteries, 2 petroglyphic locations, 2 shell mounds, and one opening to an underground shaft in the region between the above two geographical en- tities. In summary, Lange reports that the surface- collected and excavated material demonstrates a re- latively long time span of cultural activity in the area. Ceramics range from Zoned Bichrome (300 B.C. to A.D. 300) to the Murillo-type pottery known to have been in use at the time of the Spanish contact (A.D. 1524). It does not appear at present that they have a complete sequence from the former to the latter, but a good portion of the 1,500-year span is represented in their material. The survey and especially the excavations planned were greatly hampered by the revocation of all excava- tion permits through the Costa Rican government pending the revision of the antiquity laws. PANAMA. Roberto de la Guardia, the active chief of the Museo Chiricano in David left that position and transferred to the University of Santa Maria la Antigua in Panama City. It is hoped that in spite of this the activities of the Museo Chiricano will not cease and that de la Guardia will continue his efforts to promote the role of archaeology in his country. In the mean- time, de la Guardia began the investigation of the site of La Joyita in the vicinity of the Tocumen airport near Panama City. Surface collecting at this site yielded sherds of a yet unpublished red monochrome type. Ornamentation was done by excision, impression of shell and reed and applique. In the latter decora- tion, zoomorphic shapes are predominant. Big ollas with relief decorations and restricted mouths, bowls with outcurving rims, plates with annular bases and comales were observed. Such ceramics also have been [Vol. 35, No. 4, 1970 found at Panama Viejo and are apparently present at Venado Beach. However, the more decorated types, including the polychromes, found together with it at the two sites last mentioned are missing at La Joyita. De la Guardia thinks, therefore, that his site may be earlier than the other two. However, only excavations planned for the next time, can prove this. During the year of 1968 Don Crusoe (Museum of the Florida State University) investigated cave sites in the Chame region, Panama Province. The results have been incorporated in his thesis titled: The Archaic- Formative of Panama, an abstract of which follows: Fishing, besides hunting, collecting, and perhaps agriculture formed the basic subsistence of the Mona- grillo phase (of the Parita sequence, dated 2130 B.C.). The evidence indicated that the ceramic types of the Sarigua and Santa Maria phases have been manu- factured at the same time as the ceramic complexes of the sites Bahia de Chame and Madden. Therefore, these two phases have been combined into a single phase called Sarigua-Santa Maria. Also, during this phase they used caves extensively for interments. The final part of this phase is marked by a change to localities further inland. At the same time, the sites get more extensive. The projectile points, considered pre- ceramic and found on Macapale Island in the Madden Lake region, are in reality associated with ceramics of the Sarigua-Santa Maria phase. A number of new sites and phases are recorded for the Chame and Madden Lake region. Of these, Sitio Hidalgo (Chame region) is considered contemporary with the Cerro Mangote phase of the Azuero Peninsula, which has a date of 4853 B.C. Sites contemporary with the Monagrillo phase in the Chame region are: Llano Bonito, San Carlos Ant6n, Gorgona, Sitio Fango, etc., while the Peion de Chilibre in the Madden Lake region belongs in this setting. Recently, another report on Sitio Hidalgo (original- ly named Sitio Haquero) has been received from W. M. Snyder (member of the newly-founded Florida State University Isthmian Anthropological Society). Snyder mentions that the site is nonceramic, but doubts that it is preceramic. Some photographs of projectile points from this site are not very different from points found in late ceramic times in Chiriquf and on Azuero Peninsula. Bertha B. Brown (Florida State University Isthmian Anthropological Society) recently found another fluted point in the Madden Lake area. The photograph shows a more-or-less-triangular point with a short broad stem. The fluting occurs on one side of the stem only and ends in a sharp hinge on the blade. The flute has a length of about 2.5 cm., while the whole point is slightly over 4.5 cm. long. The specimen is, therefore, completely different from the other fluted points, or fragments, found in the region, and which are comparable with early fluted points in North America, Also in 1969, Alejandro M6ndez (Director of the Museo Nacional, Panama City) retired. In spite of the fact that he was a zoologist by profession, he had a profound interest in archaeology and encouraged many investigators in their work in Panama. He will certainly be fondly remembered by all who had the opportunity to work with him. His post was taken over by Reina Torres de Arauz, well-known ethno- ameRican antiquity</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT RESEARCH logist who formerly worked in the Anthropology Department of the Universidad Nacional, Panama City. Torres de Arauz is attempting to coordinate the efforts of the different individuals and institutions engaged in archaeological investigations in Panama. Furthermore, she is trying to secure money and to gain the interest of archaeologists in a salvage project in the Darien region of Panama. A large dam on the Rio Bayano will be built during the next two years. It will inundate a large part of the middle course of that river. No investigations of any serious nature have been conducted there to date, in spite of the fact that the Bayano Valley would be an important route for crossing the Isthmus south of the present canal. Therefore, many sites could be expected in this region. A coordinated program of salvage archaeology is urgently needed to save at least some knowledge of this part of the country. WOLFGANG HABERLAND LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA ARGENTINA. A new organization, the Instituto de Investigaciones Arqueologicas de Olavarrfa, has been founded to carry on archaeological research formerly conducted by the Museo Etnografico Municipal "Damaso Arce." Field work is in progress on the Atlantic coast and the pampa south of the Rfo Salado in the Province of Buenos Aires under the direction of Guillermo B. Madrazo, with the collaboration of archaeologist Leonardo Daino and geographer Delia Alejandra Perfumo. This zone was occupied by hunters and gatherers and the research so far has been concentrated on the problem of chronology. Four lithic complexes have been identified: (1) worked pebbles of the Puntarrubiense complex, on the coast; (2) tools and flakes of the Blancagrandense and Bolivarense complexes in inland locations in deposits extending from the surface to a depth of 40 cm. in recent humus; (3) points resembling those found by Bird in Level I at the Straits of Magellan, one site being located on a hilltop 365 m. above sea level; and (4) flakes produced by a different technique than the Blancagrandense-Bolivarense and associated with deer bones below the recent humus at a depth of 1.2 m. BRAZIL. A systematic examination of the mounds in the wet lowlands of southern coastal Brazil and adjacent Uruguay is being conducted between January, 1970, and February, 1971, under the auspices of the Instituto Anchietano de Pesquisas, Rio Grande do Sul. Participants include Pedro Ignacio Schmitz, Guilherme Naue, Itala Irene Basile Becker, Wander Valente, and Maria Helena Abrahao Schorr. Stratigraphic excavations in selected mounds in the regions of Camaqua, Santa Vitoria, Rio Grande (Brazil) and Treinta y Tres (Uruguay) will provide a basis for recognizing phase differences and recon- structing the evolution of adaptation to this unusual environmental situation. The long-term investigation of coastal sambaquis of Santa Catarina, begun in 1967 by the staff of the Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, has completed its first phase. The project is under the direction of Anamaria Beck, with the collaboration of Gerusa Maria Duarte, Edson Medeiros de Araujo, and students from the Museu de Antropologia. Three sambaquis have been excavated: Congonhas I on the south coast; Rio Lessa near Florianopolis; and Morro do Ouro on the north coast. Preliminary analysis permits the recognition of two periods. The earliest, typified by the sambaqui of Congonhas I, is preceramic. Characteristic stone artifacts are polished axes, tembetas, zooliths, objects of unusual shape and un- determined use, and chipped tools. Extended (rarely, flexed) burials are common, with or without grave goods. Two phases have been tentatively recognized, the Congonhas phase and the Morro do Ouro phase, differing principally in burial pattern. The second and more recent period, characterized by pottery and worked bone, is represented at Rio Lessa and several sambaquis on the north coast. Pottery is undecorated but differences in surface color and treatment permit the recognition of two phases, the Rio Pinheiros 8 phase with dark or red surfaces and the Rio Lessa phase with polished black surfaces. The Programa Nacional de Pesquisas Arque- ologicas (PRONAPA), co-sponsored by the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisas and the Smithsonian Institution, completed its fifth and final year on June 30, 1970. Eleven field projects were undertaken during the final year by the following archaeologists and institutions: Mario F. Simoes, Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Belem; Nassaro A. de Souza Nasser, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte; Valentin Calder6n, Universidade Federal da Bahia; Celso Perota, Univer- sidade Federal do Espfrito Santo; Ondemar Ferreira Dias, Divasao de Patrim6nio Hist6rico e Artfstico, Estado da Guanabara; Silvia Maranca, Museu Paulista; Igor Chmyz, Universidade Federal do Parana; Jos6 Wilson Rauth, Universidade Estadual do Paranagua; Walter F. Piazza, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina; Jos6 Proenza Brochado, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; and Eurico Th. Miller, Museu Arqueologico do Rio Grande do Sul. By the end of the PRONAPA, about 1500 archaeological sites had been recorded, sampled, and, where possible, subjected to stratigraphic testing. Numerous regional seriated sequences provide a reliable chronological framework for the coastal strip as well as considerable data on the geographical distributions of the con- stituent phases and ceramic traditions. Preliminary reports have been published annually by the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Belem, and final monographs will be prepared during the coming year. COLOMBIA. During the summer of 1968, Charles E. Bolian (Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois) conducted an archaeological survey of that section of the upper Amazon Basin within the boundaries of the Trapecio of Amazonas as part of the Continuing Program of Research on the Culture History of the Amazon Basin begun by Donald W. Lathrap. Ten sites were discovered between Leticia and the Rio Loreto-Yacfi. Eight are located above flood stage, while two are in areas of current alluvial deposition. Excavations are planned to begin at four of the more promising sites in June, 1970, in order to establish the cultural chronology of this section of the upper Amazon basin. Two of the sites to be excavated are on the Rfo Loreto-Yacui, one is at Loreto, and the other is at the Tikuma village of Ararra. A fiber-tempered pottery complex isolated at site TRA-11, a three-component site on the Rfo Loreto- 519</page><page sequence="15">520 Yacui, cannot be related to any other known ceramic complex in the Amazon Basin. Other complexes are affiliated with the Manacapurui phase and the Paca- cocha-Cumancaya tradition of the Central Ucayali. A ceramic tradition has also been defined that appears to be ancestral to modern Tikuna ceramics. No sites produced pottery closely related to the Polychrome tradition of the Amazon basin. ECUADOR. Archaeological survey was undertaken during the fall of 1969, and the spring of 1970, in the Upano, Morona, and Pastaza drainages of southeastern Ecuador by Pedro I. Porras, with a grant from the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research. One of the goals of this survey is to evaluate tle role of this part of the Ceja de Montanla in cultural interchange between the highlands and the lowlands. Seventeen sites were investigated during 1969 in the triangular zone between Macas, Indanza, and Huasaga. The pottery is characterized by incised and punctate decoration, often in zones or along the rim exterior. Zoned red, prominent among previous collections from Macas, is extremely rare. PERU. During the summer of 1969, William Allen (University of California, Santa Barbara) and two graduate students, Waldrop and Juan Yangiez-Bernal, working on behalf of the Department of Anthro- pology, University of Illinois, continued intensive study of the Alto Pachitea. Much material illuminating the transition from the early Cobichaniqui complex to the Pangotsi complex was recovered and surveys indicated that intensive utilization of land for agri- cultural purposes in areas well away from the major streams started very early. Peter Roe and Warren DeBoer worked at the late site of Shuahuaya on the Upper Ucayali, an extensive buried midden containing a large number of urn burials. On the one hand, the materials from Shuabuaya are clearly derivable from the Cumancaya complex; on the other, they are related to and pro- bably ancestral to the ceramic tradition still flourish- ing among the Shipibo and Conibo. Shuahuaya appears to be a protohistoric to historic Conibo site, [Vol. 35, No. 4, 1970 although of sufficient antiquity that the present Conibo have no memory of the earlier occupation. Roe and DeBoer also made further excavations at the site of Cumancaya itself. They were able to verify the association of the Hupa-iya occupation with the Stage 5 river channel. Their limited testing did not locate the center of the earlier Shakimu but yielded a large collection of Cumancaya materials. Ronald Weber undertook intensive excavations at sites on the north shore of Yarinacocha. The enlarged sample of Caimito materials substantiate the near identity between the Caimito complex and the Napo phase. They also permit detailed documentation of the continuity between Napo-Caimito ceramics and those of the historic and recent Cocama Omagua. VENEZUELA. Alberta Zucchi is conducting a 5-year project in the western llanos (State of Barinas) with the goal of establishing the cultural chronology, reconstructing subsistence and settlement patterns that have permitted adaptation to the seasonally flooded environment, and evaluating evidence of migration and cultural contact. Two related complexes have been established so far: Cafo del Oso and La Betania, spanning a time period from about 1000 B.C. to A.D. 1200. Recent excavations at Hato de la Calzada have shown that the mounds, causeways, and ridged fields equate with the more recent levels of the Canfo del Oso complex. Polychrome pottery has been radiocarbon dated just prior to the inception of the Christian era. This research is sponsored by the Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientfficas (IVIC). Another IVIC project is investigation of lithic in- dustries associated with Pleistocene fauna on the northwest coast (State of Falc6n). The research is being conducted by J. M. Cruxent in collaboration with geologist W. Petzall and geochronologist M. Tamers. As of January, 1970, Joboid points had been found in association with mastodon, megatherium, glyptodon, and other extinct Pleistocene fauna at the sites of Taima-Taima and Cucuruchiu. BETTY J.
