It is only in this way that the true adjustment of ideas can be explored. . . . The scopc of a metaphysical principle should not be limited otherwise than by its own meaning." A. N. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, pp. 304-305. An organism is a whole whose parts serve as "organs" or instruments to a purpose or end-value inherent in the whole. It is scarcely deniable that organs and organisms exist. A man is aware of realizing purpose, and he is aware of doing so through parts of his body. Hence he is aware that he exists as an organism. It follows that either nature contains two types of wholes, the organic and the inorganic, or all natural wholes are organic. We must choose between a dualism and an organic monism, since an inor- ganic monism would contradict obvious facts. Is organic monism possible? It seems not, for just as it is evident that a man is an organism, so it is evident that a mountain is not, although primitive man sometimes thought otherwise. Science exhibits nothing in the behavior of the parts of the mountain to suggest that these parts serve a purpose whose realization is enjoyed by the mountain as a whole. But this fact does not prove that no form of organic monism is possible. There is no evidence that the parts of a finger serve any purpose whose realization is enjoyed by the finger. Not all the parts of an organism are organisms. Yet a finger may in two senses be viewed as organic: it belongs to an organism; and its own parts, at least on one level, the cells, are or may be organisms. That cells enjoy health and suffer from injury is a supposition that conflicts with no facts, while there are facts it helps to explain. Now similarly the mountain, like the finger, may be part or organ of a larger organic whole, perhaps the entire universe as an organism, and the molecules composing the mountain may, like cells, though on a still humbler level, be organic wholes. The sub-molecular parts may contribute value, in the form of simple feelings, to the molecules, and the molecules may contribute value to the cosmos. 1 For the phenomenological foundations of the speculations in this article, see my contribution to Philosophical Essays in Memory of Edmund Husserl (Harvard University Press).

Organic monism, in the sense just indicated, includes within itself a limited or relative dualism. The assertion is not that all wholes are pur- posive or organic; but that, first, all well-unified wholes are organic, and second, that all wholes whatever both involve and are involved in organic wholes. But what wholes are well-unified? My suggestion is that any whole which has less unity than its more unified parts is not an organism;2 though according to organic monism, its more unified parts, and some unified whole of which it is itself a part, must in all cases be organisms. For example, botanists incline to regard the plant cell, rather than the entire plant, as the primary unit of vegetable activity. A plant is a quasi- organic colony of true organisms, the cells, and not, like the vertebrate animal, itself an organism. Again, a termite colony exhibits definite ana- logies to a single animal organism, but to an organism with less unity than termites, say a flat-worm. The colony in relation to its members is not a super-organism but an epi- or quasi-organism. There is little reason to suppose the colony feels, though good reason to think termites feel. Or again, a mountain has inferior dynamic unity to its own molecules. Remove a part from a molecule, and the whole responds with a systematic readjust- ment of its parts, a response to which the activity of the mountain as a whole offers only a feeble analogy, even if the mountain be a volcano. Thus it is reasonable to deny that mountains, trees, or termite colonies enjoy feelings, but not so reasonable to deny that rock-crystals, tree-cells, and termites enjoy them. Similarly, with all the talk about the "group-mind," there are no good indications that human groups are organisms which could think and feel as individuals. All that one can show is that human beings, like termites and atoms, act differently according to the social environment, the neighbors, which they have. Yet there is a hidden truth in the group mind concept. As we shall see, the cosmic community, the universe, does have a group mind. The notion of organism suggests that quantum mechanics is not the whole account of dynamic action. For this mechanics assumes that nothing influences what electrons, protons, and the like are doing in an organic body except what other electrons, protons, and the like are doing. What then of what the man, say, is doing; for instance, thinking? This thinking is not just an arrangement of particles and waves; and either the thinking is an "idle wheel" in nature, accomplishing nothing, a detached 2 The reasons for this principle are given in my essay on "The Group Mind" in Social Research, May, 1942, vol. IX, pp. 248-265.</page><page sequence="3">ORGANIC AND INORGANIC WHOLES 129 miracle, or electrons in the human brain must move as they do partly be- cause the human being thinks as he does. However, when one is in deep sleep, what goes on in the body may indeed be little more than mere group action-not, to be sure, of particles, but of cells. And if a cell dies, then what happens in its remains will be no longer what it is doing, but what its molecules are doing. Experiments to show the merely mechanical character of the organism may, in fact, only show that the organism can at times be reduced approximately to an inorganic state. The Uncertainty Principle of physics is neither, as some hold, a sufficient basis of organic freedom, nor is it, as others hold, irrelevant to freedom. It is not sufficient, for it does not deal with individuals, except on the level of electrons, and freedom belongs to individuals, particularly those on higher levels. But the Principle is relevant to freedom, for it makes it clear that deterministic laws apply to groups as such, not individuals. Study of gases suggested this conclusion to Clerk-Maxwell long before quantum mechanics. However, Einstein and many others argue that higher indivi- duals are systems containing so many lower individuals that the statis- tical regularity of these systems must be close to absolute. This is to forget that the human being is not just many individual electrons and the like, but one individual, one person. It is a merely secondary technical question whether or not Compton and others are right in supposing that the delicate trigger action of the nervous system magnifies the quantum uncertainty into a statistical uncertainty for the whole system. The primary point, con- cerning which we are all experts if we stop to think, is that a man is not just a system of low-grade individuals but a single high-grade individual with a value-unity, a mind, acting on his parts and affecting their action on each other, thus-even though ever so slightly-falsifying physical laws. The philosophical relevance of the Uncertainty Principle is itself a matter of principle, the principle that what is individual is free, and that only groups so far as they are merely that, are absolutely regular in behavior. To return to our main thesis, organic monism. Part of the justification of this monism (the full justification would extend far beyond the limits of this article) is that the organic principle is sufficiently flexible to explain the relative lack of organic wholeness found in certain parts of nature, whereas the notion of absolutely non-purposive or inorganic wholes throws no light whatever on the existence or nature of purpose. If there are wholes which are directly valuable in and for themselves, there can be groups of these wholes which are valuable not directly, but for the sake of their mem- bers, or of some larger whole. Given the concept of purpose as ultimate, we can restrict its application by employing the distinction which purpose involves between cnd and means, or the distinction between simple and</page><page sequence="4">130 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH complex purposes, or purposes merely felt and those consciously surveyed. But given mere purposeless stuff or "matter," we have not, in so far, any notion of purpose. Even the idea of a means or instrument is not illuminated by the notion of mere or dead matter; for an organism, even a man, can function as a tool for another organism, and all that this assumes is that organisms influence each other, and this in turn follows from the notion, to be considered presently, that all lesser organisms are parts of one inclusive organism, the universe. All that dead matter could add to this is the purely negative and empty notion of something that is absolutely nothing but means. Such an absolute negation seems devoid of philosophical or scientific utility. There are, however, some apparent difficulties in the organistic doctrine. For example, the definition of organism calls for a whole with parts, and an electron, for instance, is not known to have parts. Even if it has parts, must there not be something simpler, the ultimate unit of being, which being without parts is not an organism? We must here reconsider the meaning of the term "part" as occurring in our definition of the organic. This meaning is that an organism involves a plurality of entities contribut- ing directly to the value of a single entity, the "whole." But the contrib- uting entities need not be internal to the whole in the sense of spatially smaller and included parts, as electrons are smaller than and within an atom, and as nothing known is smaller than and within the electron. To render the electron an organism it is only necessary that neighboring electrons or other particles should contribute directly to each others' values, that is, should directly feel each other. Now physics does not assert that particles are in every sense external to each other. On the contrary, a particle, as inseparable from its wave-field, overlaps other particles. This seems all the internality that is required by the general idea of organism. With the simplest organisms it is the community of neighboring entities that constitutes the plurality contributing to each entity-in a different perspective, in each case, since no two electrons, say, will have the same nearest neighbors. Where there are no smaller entities as parts, there will be no sharp distinction between internal and external. An axe seems external to a man because the man's immediate intimate relations are with the parts of his own body, so that by contrast the axe is something that contributes to his being and value only indirectly, only by first contributing, through several intermediaries usually, to the parts of his body and thence to his mind. An electron, like a disembodied spirit, has no bodily parts- some physicists say it has no spatial extension at all hence its intimates, if any, will be its equals, its neighbor particles, or the larger wholes which they and it constitute. It will be an organic democrat and proletarian, but not an organic aristocrat.</page><page sequence="5">ORGANIC AND INORGANIC WHOLES 131 One may well ascribe intimates, though "external" intimates, to particles; for such entities respond immediately to neighboring particles. If an elec- tron feels anything, it must feel its neighbors, for what else could it feel? We, on the contrary, feel chiefly our bodies, and through these, other things. Just this indirectness of feeling, mediated by entities of lesser power and complexity than oneself, is what is meant by having a body. To have no bodyis tohave no inferior servants immediately bound to one's own purposes and feelings. Hence it is the electron, the lowest not the highest organism -in spite of what has often been said about God-that best fits the idea of an unembodied spirit. The electron, one might say, is embodied only in its environment, not in itself. The mention of God brings us to the question at the opposite extreme from that about particles. If the simplest of beings can yet have complexity in the sense required for organic wholeness, can the most complex of beings, the universe, have sufficient simplicity in the sense of unity to be an organ- ism, no doubt the supreme organism? If lack of internal parts does not prevent organicity, what about lack of an external environment? The same principle, though in opposite application, solves both problems. All that an organism requires is "an immediately contributory complexity." An organic whole must deal with or "respond" to some field of entities or environment, but the term "internal environment" is not a quibble. An organism can respond to its parts, if it has them, or its neighbors, if it has them, or to both, if it has both. An electron has only neighbors; the universe, only parts, to respond to; but both may be responsive, and in so far, organic, entities. It may indeed be urged that the only purpose of internal adjustments, or responses to parts, is to serve as basis for desirable external adjustments, responses to neighbors. But it can, with more truth, be retorted that external adjustments are desirable only as means for the attainment of the internal organic state known as happiness. The only error in this second position is that with organisms other than the cosmos the internal field of response fails to include more than a fraction of the low and high-grade life in existence. Thus it is not a case of external relations for their own sake, but of such relations for the sake of dealing with what would otherwise be missed entirely. The cosmos, which deals with everything through its internal relations, can perfectly well dispense with external ones. To make this unique privilege of inclusiveness of organic unity, a lack of such unity is simply to lose our way among our own abstractions. But if the universe has organic unity, where, some have asked, is the world-brain? Fechner long ago pointed out how unscientific the question is. On each great level of life the basic functions are performed by organs that have only a remote analogy from one level to another. We smile at</page><page sequence="6">132 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH the lack of generalizing power shown by those of earlier times who supposed that microscopic animals must have, in miniature, all the organs of macro- scopic ones. Is it any less naive to think that the world, if organic, must have a magnified brain? Surely if any organic level must be a special case it is the universe, at the opposite end of the scale from that other special case, the particle. As we have seen, the particle has no special internal organs because its neighbors serve it as organs. The universe, conversely, has no neighbors as organs because everything is its internal organ. Everything contributes equally directly to the cosmic value. This means that the world-mind will have no special brain, but that rather every individual is to that mind as a sort of brain-cell. The brain is only that part of the body which most immediately and powerfully affects and is affected by the mind, the value- unity of the whole. The rest of the body is by comparison a house for the nervous system, a quasi-external environment. Now as the cosmos has no external environment, so it has no gradations of externality, and not even a quasi-external environment, and thus the cosmic analogue of a brain will be simply the entire system of things as wholly internal and immediate to the cosmic mind. A special world-brain, so far from confirming the sup- position of a truly cosmic mind, would negate it. You may object that if the cosmos has no external environment to deal with it does have an internal one, and that the coordination of internal actions requires a brain. But remember that the brain is only a very rough and partial coordinator of internal actions. It has almost no direct control over myriads of actions that go on in the body, even in the brain cavity itself, and this not because of any deficiency of the vertebrate brain in particular, but as a consequence of there being a brain at all as a special organ. What is needed for supreme control is obviously that every organ should be directly, and not via some other organ, such as a nervous system, responsive to the whole. The idea of a perfect yet special brain-organ is a contradiction in terms, but the idea of a perfect mind, a mind coextensive with existence and thus omniscient, is not for all that a contradiction. For such a mind must have, not a world-part as brain, but the whole world serving as higher equivalent of a brain; so that just as between a brain cell and the human mind there is no further mechanism, so between every in- dividual in existence and the world-mind there is no chain of intermediaries, not even a nervous system, but each and every one is in the direct grip of the world-value. The higher the organism, the larger the part directly responsive to the whole; the highest organism must be the largest organism as all brain. But what, you ask, would the cosmic organism be doing? To what end the coordination of internal activities, where no external action is possible?</page><page sequence="7">ORGANIC AND INORGANIC WHOLES 133 The answer is that the end is the prosperity of the parts and of the whole as the integration of the parts. As our enjoyment of health is our participa- tion in the health of the numerous cells, so the happiness of the cosmos is the integration of the lesser happinesses of the parts. The benevolence of God is the only way the psycho-physics of the cosmic organism can be conceived, as Fechner, one of the first great experimental psycho-physicists, was at pains to point out. Theologians have generally missed this valuable argument, for reasons which I believe to be specious.3 It has for instance been argued that if the cosmos be one divine organism there could be no conflict or suffering. All would be perfect peace, flawless interadjustment. This, I think, is an error. The basic pattern of organic unity is that individuals form organs for other individuals. This pro- position is convertible, namely if individuals are organs, organs are indivi- duals, singly or in groups. Now an individual is self-active; if there are many individuals in the ultimate organism there are many self-active agents in that organism. Being is action, what is really many must act as many. The higher is compounded of the lower, not by suppression but by preservation of the dynamic integrity of the lower. The cosmos could not guarantee that the many individuals within it will act always in concord, for to carry out such a guarantee the cosmos must completely coerce the lesser individuals, that is, must deprive them of all individuality. Existence is essentially social,4 plural, free, and exposed to risk, and this is required by our definition of organism. For if the action of the parts had no freedom with respect to the whole, there would be no dynamic distinction between whole and parts, and the very idea of whole would lose its meaning. It is true that the many individuals, being organs of the cosmic individual, must, according to our definition, contribute without fail to the value of the one, but this contribution is both negative and positive, it includes suf- fering as well as joy. The all-inclusiveness of the world-mind means, not that it is above all suffering, but that no pain and no joy is beneath its notice. All things make immediate contribution to the one, but they contribute what they are and have, their sorrow as well as their joy, their discord with their neighbors as well as their harmonies. Nearly a century ago Fechner showed that a superior consciousness must resemble all consciousness in containing a contrast between voluntary and involuntary, active and passive, elements. Volition cannot act in a vacuum, or merely upon itself. But that upon which it immediately acts must be present within it, for action and its material are inseparable. 3See Man's Vision of God, especially Ch. V. 4This essay could have been written as a generalization of "social" instead of "organic." Cf. Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas, Ch. XIII.</page><page sequence="8">134 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH In Fechner's terms, there must be involuntary impulses even in God, or there can be no divine volition or purposive activity. But these impulses must come from something. Why not from the volitions of the creatures, the lesser individuals? Our deliberate acts set up c irrents, as it were, in the mind of God, as the activities of our brain cells set up currents in our human minds. God then controls, checks, encourages, redirects these impulses. But he cannot wholly initiate or absolutely control them, not because of any weakness on his part but because absolute control of impulses or indeed of anything is a contradiction in terms. God is not limited in his power to do what he wishes to do, for he is not so confused as to wish to destroy the very nature of being, which is its organic character as many individuals in one, the many being as real as the one. Evil is largely the chance result of the social and free nature of existence. The lesser individuals, being more or less ignorant of each other, act blindly with respect to many of the effects of their acts. The divine love is not contradicted by the discords which result from this blindness, for love includes tolerance for the freedom of others. The divine perfection lies, not in the suppression of freedom wherever it involves risk, for at all points freedom involves risk, but in the wise and efficient limitation of the risks to the optimum point beyond which further limitation would diminish the promise of life more than its tragedy. Perfection is not to be defined independently of freedom, for then it would be meaningless. Rather per- fection is to be defined as the supreme way of mitigating the risk and maximizing the promise of freedom, the optimum of control, beyond which or short of which more harm and less good would result. Statesmen know that beyond a certain point interference with the lives of citizens does more harm than good, and this not solely because of the weakness or stupidity of statesmen but also because of the meaning of good as self-activity. This is part of the meaning of democracy, that people need first of all to be themselves, and this self-hood no tyrant, human or superhuman, and however benevolent, can impose upon them. But is the cosmos genuinely and organically one? Let us recall that nothing happens anywhere but its effects are communicated with the speed of light in all directions, that the same basic modes of action, expressed in quantum mechanics and relativity, pervade all parts of space. But the unity lies deeper than any such considerations can make clear. All groups short of the universe can break up, fall to pieces, in various ways and degrees. But from the cosmic community there is no secession. There is nowhere to go from the universe. It is the only aggregate that is its own foundation. This fits to perfection the idea that it is its own reason or purpose, and the integration of all purposes. We confuse ourselves in this matter by supposing that in the cosmos must</page><page sequence="9">ORGANIC AND INORGANIC WHOLES 135 be summed up all the loose-jointedness we see in various portions of the cosmos. This would be true if the loose-jointedness were, at each point, the whole story. But it is not. A sand pile is loose-jointed so far as the pile taken as a whole is concerned. Its parts serve no imaginable unitary purpose enjoyed by the pile. But it does not follow that they serve no unitary purpose. There is no unity of action of the sand-pile, but there is unity of action in the sand-pile, a unity pervading the grains of sand but referring to a larger whole than the pile. Physics tells us that the entire universe acts upon each particle to constitute its inertia. This unity of action is cosmic, and it is unbroken and all-pervasive.5 All looseness and disintegration presupposes and cannot contradict the cosmic integrity. The one cosmos arranges and rearranges itself from time to time in sub- ordinate centers of activity (which it can properly be said to create), but this formation and disintegration of the subordinate centers expresses the cosmic integrity somewhat as a man may rearrange his thoughts around different idea-foci, or different movements of his body, without ceasing to enjoy the unity of his personality while doing so. To all the foregoing, it may be objected that explanation in terms of pur- pose, teleological explanations, have been discredited in science. This is a contention with grave implications, for if science, or at least if rational know- ledge, cannot deal with purpose, then so much the worse for purpose, for knowledge, and for human life. But perhaps it is only certain forms of teleology that have been discredited. One form of teleology that we are, I think, well rid of is the notion of a single absolute world-plan, complete in every detail from all eternity, and executed with inexorable power. The objection is not solely that God would be made responsible for the imperfect adaptations and discords in nature. There is the further objection that the world process would be the idle duplicate of something in eternity. A God who knew all that the fulfillment of his purpose could bring would have no need of that fulfillment or of purpose. Complete knowledge is complete possession: it is just because a man does not know in detail what "knowing his friends better" would be like, that he has the purpose to come to know them better. As Bergson was one of the first to see, even a world-purpose must be indeterminate as to details or it is not a purpose or anything we can conceive. But still further, an absolute and inexorable purpose would deny individuality, self-activity, hence reality, to the lesser individuals, the creatures. As we have seen, ill-adjustments, evils-apart from moral evil, evil deliberately chosen-are not willed but are chance results of free acts. But if evil results partly by chance, so does good. Thus, the Darwinian 5The action is not, according to physics, instantaneous. This is a serious com- plication, though not, I believe, an insuperable difficulty, for our thesis.</page><page sequence="10">136 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH idea that adjustments are the result of competition for survival among chance variations may in some degree be true. But it does not follow that the maintenance within the cosmos of the general conditions under which chance and competition will produce evolution toward higher forms is itself a mere matter of chance, of the unpurposed. The "fittest to survive" need not, so far as chance and competition are concerned, be better in any other sense, as one can see from the splendid survival of some of the lowest forms. The general trend toward more complex forms of integration can, it seems, be deduced only from purpose. Moreover, good things that do come about by chance may nevertheless enter into purpose, in our basic sense of end-value realized by some whole. A man who goes to the theater to be amused can say that he has accomplished his purpose without implying that he knew in advance just what jokes he wished to hear! The conception of the ultimate or cosmic organism is the remedy for two great errors of political thought, abstract individualism and abstract or mythical collectivism. Neither the human individual nor any human class or race is an absolute end, but only that whole in which men and nations and all existences have their place and value. We are members one of another because we are members of one ultimate body-mind, one inclusive, unborn, and imperishable organism. CHARLES HARTSHORNE. THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.</page></plain_text>
