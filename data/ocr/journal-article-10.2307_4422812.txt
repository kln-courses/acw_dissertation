<plain_text><page sequence="1">A UNIQUE TAHITIAN FIGURE HE two-headed figure illustrated in P1. xIx was acquired by purchase in 1955 and was given the number 1955 Oc. io. I. The vendor was at that time able to supply only the information that it had come from a house in Eire formerly belonging to the family of 'Admiral Jervis'. On stylistic grounds the figure was assigned to the Society Islands, the nearest parallel known being a specimen in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu,' which was found in a cave, together with two others which have disappeared, about the year 1903. Though the Bishop Museum figure has only one head it is in other respects strikingly similar. Another figure already in the collections of the British Museum, less closely similar but showing many points of resemblance, is illustrated in P1. xIx. This was collected by George Bennet (or Bennett), who in 1820 was appointed by the Directors of the London Missionary Society one of their Deputies (the Rev. Daniel Tyerman was the other) to inspect the mission field in the Pacific and Madagascar; he presented it to the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society, by whom it was transferred to the British Museum in 1871. On its back is an ink inscription in the Tahitian dialect, now partly illegible, which was copied when the specimen was received. It reads (in part): 'Tii Tane ... no mia te moua Orofena', which may be translated 'male carved image ... from the top of (or from east of) Orofena mountain',2 followed by 'the high mountain in Tahiti' (in English). Orofena (Orohena) is the highest peak in Tahiti.3 The figure recently acquired, the height of which is 23 inches (58.5 cm.), has two heads placed at the extremities of the shoulders, facing forwards and inclined outwards. The eyes are in relief, and comparison with the Bishop Museum figure suggests that they are unfinished, a conclusion supported by the fact that the left eye of the right head has an additional curved ridge which is absent in the other three eyes. Lips, nipples, and navel are carved in relief; the latter is prominent and cylindrical, standing about one-third of an inch (about 0- 9 cm.) above the sur- face of the abdomen. The body is almost square in outline as seen from the front. The elbows are flexed and the hands rest on the abdomen at the level of the navel. The scrotum is clearly though not particularly realistically carved. The penis is missing; it seems at some time to have been broken off and nailed back in place. The legs are flexed at the knees. In lateral view the buttocks are seen to be promi- nent and rounded, the back flat. There is a pronounced horizontal ridge across the shoulders, running behind the necks, a feature that is general on Society Islands figures, and also on those from the southern Cook Group and the Austral Islands. When acquired the figure was in fairly good condition except that a number of cracks had appeared in the wood, which had become dessicated, and the left head had been broken off at the neck and refixed with an iron spike. There has 45</page><page sequence="2">been some damage to the feet; and, as mentioned above, the penis is missing. The spike was removed, the head replaced, and the whole figure has been restored where necessary and treated to prevent further deterioration. Damage would perhaps have been worse had the figure not been made in such a way that the grain of the wood gives the maximum strength; the two heads appear to have been carved from two branches which here formed a fork, the body being cut from the trunk or major limb. A third branch seems to have diverged in the region of the navel. Investigation soon established that the famous Admiral Jervis-Lord St. Vincent-had no connexion with Ireland and did not serve in the Pacific. Certain other naval families of the same name, some with Irish connexions, provided no officer likely to have collected this piece. Mr. W. E. D. Allen of Cappagh, Co. Waterford, then kindly provided the information that the figure had been obtained at the sale of the contents of a near-by house, Affane, which had belonged to a member of the Power family, and referred to Burke's Landed Gentry of Ireland (4th ed., I958), which showed that the late owner's mother had been a daughter of Captain Sampson Jervois, R.N., a member of another local family. Through Mr. Allen's good offices certain journals kept by Sampson Jervois when a midshipman, between i801 and i808, were made available for examination by their present owner, Dr. W. Luck. During this period Midship- man Jervois served only in British and North American waters and in the Atlantic. The journals did, however, establish his naval identity, and reference to the Admiralty Library then produced the information that Lieut. Sampson Jervois served as First Lieutenant of H.M.S. Dauntless on the East Indies station from 1818 to 1823, and that during this time H.M.S. Dauntless visited the Society Group.4 Inquiry at the Library of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, in the hope of finding Jervois's journals for this period, was fruit- less. His earlier journals in any case are concerned almost entirely with naval matters-bearings, winds, employment of the people-and it is not likely that he recorded in any detail the circumstances in which this figure was acquired. The Public Record Office, however, holds the logs of H.M.S. Dauntless for most of this period. During a Pacific cruise she was 'running between the islands of Christina [Tahuata] and La Dominica [Hivaoa]' in the Marquesas on 23 Decem- ber 1821. On 24 December she was at anchor in Hanamanoo (Hanamenu) Bay, Hivaoa; and on 27 and 28 December in Resolution (Vaitahu) Bay, Tahuata. On stylistic grounds, however, it can be assumed that the figure was not ob- tained in the Marquesas. On 3 January I822 H.M.S. Dauntless was 'hove-to for a boat' two or three leagues off Point Venus, 'Otahite'. From 0o January to 19 January she was anchored in Matavai Bay, Tahiti. During this time fresh meat (four hogs) was purchased and water was replenished, and five seamen, a boy, and a private of marines deserted. On 20 January, after she had sailed, 46</page><page sequence="3">two more seamen deserted from the cutter. On 21 January she was 'standing off and on shore' off Pare Bay. During the period in Society Islands waters lashings for disobedience of orders, drunkenness, and insolence seem to have been rather exceptionally frequent. Although the logs are not quite complete, another visit to the Society Islands or to another central Polynesian group during the short period not covered is very unlikely. It therefore seems almost certain that the figure under discussion was obtained between 3 January and 21 January 1822 in Tahiti, and probably between I o January and 19 January in Matavai Bay, which is on the north coast of the island. The Tahitians, unlike other Polynesians, apparently did not carve wooden anthropomorphic figures of their great gods. These were represented by images of closely plaited coconut fibre on a base formed by a block or bar of wood, covered with red feathers, and sometimes bearing highly conventionalized facial features or limbs, also made of coconut-fibre cord. The carved wooden figures seem to have represented spirits of a lower order, some at least being those of deified chiefs or warriors of renown, which were greatly feared. These figures were used by sorcerers, who had the power of calling the spirit to inhabit the figure. The sorcerers seem to have known various methods of working black magic, including the use of nail-parings, food remnants, or other matter closely connected with the victim; these methods, according to the early accounts, were very effective, often bringing about rapid and painful death.5 The figure here described must have belonged to this category of sorcerer's images. It would be interesting to know why this figure has two heads. Janus-headed figures-the heads facing in opposite directions-are not uncommon in several Polynesian groups; but figures with two heads side-by-side and both facing for- ward on one body are rare. There is one in stone, from Hawaii, in the collection of the Musde de l'Homme in Paris.6 This seems to be of relatively recent origin, perhaps connected with a society called Hale Naua formed by King David Kalakaua (who succeeded in 1874) to encourage the study of traditional Hawaiian culture.7 In Cook's 7ournal there is a reference to a figure of Maui in Tahiti with seven heads ; but as Tupia, the Tahitian, was the only authority for this it must be treated with reserve. Possibly he was referring to the practice, described by Teuira Henry, of attaching figures in clusters to posts, so that they faced in all directions. They apparently marked a taboo on the use of food from a certain area of land.9 Whatever the explanation, it is certain that a unique figure of great interest has been added to the Department of Ethnography's Polynesian collections, already of outstanding quality.

This figure is illustrated by Dr. Peter H. Buck in 'Mangarevan Images', EtAno- logia Cranmorensis, iv (1939), pl. v1I. 2 I am indebted to Mr. G. B. Milner of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, for this translation. Mr. Milner tells me that certainty in translation is difficult owing to the omission of glottal stops; and that 'carved figure of Tane' is not likely to be the meaning of the first two words, as this sense would require a preposition between them (Tane was one of the great gods of the Society Islands). 3 In the Saffron Walden Museum, Essex, Miss Susan Davis, the Curator, showed me another Tahitian figure, rather different in style, which was presented by G. Bennet. On the back, in ink, is written 'Tii vahine' ('female carved image'). Bennet arrived in Tahiti in September 1821 and finally left, after various travels, in May 1824. 4 For this information my thanks are due to Miss V. S. Heath of the Admiralty Library. s See, e.g., William Ellis, Polynesian Researches, 2 vols. (London, I829), ii. 227-9; Teuira Henry, Ancient Tahiti, Bernice P.
