<plain_text><page sequence="1">FIELD RESEARCH AND MAKING OBJECTS SPEAK by Barbara E. Frank If we wish to understand better the social and spiritual mean ings of individual pots, then we need to know something of the women and men who made them and the social, economic, and spiritual contexts within which they were conceived, created, and used. As already suggested, all too often objects enter museum and private collections with their unique histories silent. Making objects speak requires the concerted and collaborative efforts of art historians, anthropologists, and other scholars from a wide range of disciplines. Some of the most intense, sustained, and interdisciplinary research on ceramics in Africa has been in the Inland Niger Delta region of Mali, where pottery production remains a major industry (FIGS. 5-6). Following a number of important individ ual studies (Gardi 1985, LaViolette 1987, 2000) and in close col laboration with the Musee National du Mali and the Institut des Sciences Humaines, Allan Gallay led a team of archaeologists on a series of ethnoarchaeological projects in the Inland Niger Delta region between 1988 and 1994, in an effort to link styles of technology and object styles and types with demographic infor mation about gender, family heritage, and ethnicity (Gallay and Huysecom 1989; Gallay, Huysecom, and Mayor 1998; Gallay et al. 1996, 1998). In these studies careful recording of individual artist by patronym as well as artisan class, ethnic affiliation, and location provides evidence of the structured coherence of differ ent social systems, as well as revealing instances of the variability of identity and status (see LaViolette 1995). They have identified distinct technologies used to form pots and located them within specific regional and ethnic contexts'0 and documented the range and depth of ceramic assemblages. Similarly, art historian Christopher Roy (1975, 1989, 2000a, 2000b, 2003) has focused much of his research defining different forming technologies and identifying them with particular ethnic contexts in Burkina Faso. His recent DVD African Pottery Techniques (2003) offers nine distinct forming and firing sequences, remarkable for the skill and dexterity of the artists who make what they do seem effortless. What emerges from these studies is not only insight into the archaeological record, but also an unusually rich picture of the relationship between ethnic diversity, craft specialization, and the technology of production."

PHOTO: ROBERT LIFSON. C THE ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO A Somono woman is often given a capacious and beautifully decorated water container upon marriage and it remains an important part of her househould furniture throughout her lifetime. The patterns on this vessel are impressed with combs, sticks, and stamps. Though a few potters still practice such time-consuming techniques, slip-painted designs have been gaining in popularity in recent days. This approach has been especially influential for my own research. Like my earlier work on Bamana and Maninka potters, my current project examines the historical links among ceramic traditions by mapping social identity, ceramic technology, and objects in a comparative regional framework. In my essay here, I focus on a group of women potters in southeastern Mali who do not fit the blacksmith-potter paradigm so prevalent among Mande peoples elsewhere. Instead I look to the south and east, adopting a broad geographical frame of reference that has pro vided me with important clues to the origins of these women and their ceramic technology. The association of blacksmiths and potters is part of what led the sculptor Janet Goldner to the community of Kalabougou, Mali. Although she was interested in learning about how they made pots, she also wanted to understand something of the con text of their lives. Her photo essay documents aspects of their practice at the same time as it provides a personal and intimate perspective on the lived experience of these women as artists, craftswomen, mothers, and wives. 6 Somono potter Niamoye Nientao finishing a water jar. Jenne, Mali. PHOTOGRAPH BY ADRIA LAVIOLETTE, 1983. My research has made me realize how important it is to begin with careful documentation of all aspects of ceramic produc tion, including the tools and processes of production as well as the range and variation in ceramic assemblage. Marla Berns' research note provides just such a description of pottery mak ing processes by Mo women in Bonakire, Ghana, at a particular moment in time. In her subsequent research in the Benue valley of northern Nigeria (1986, 1989b, 1990, 2000) Berns combines an art historical attention to the style and iconography of ceramic forms with contemporary linguistic and anthropological data on ritual practice and meanings. She argues that ceramic arts in this region are conceptualized as active participants in maintaining and legitimating social relationships not just in this world, but between the living and the ancestral dead. There is no easy divi sion between sacred and profane, thus the symbolism of figura tive vessels embedded in ritual contexts is inseparable from the material symbols of daily life. Iconographic analysis is also central to Christopher Slogar's research. His contribution to this issue examines contemporary Calabar visual culture in order to interpret the corpus of recently recovered archaeological ceramics from the region. What he finds is a close correspondence between the ostensibly abstract decoration on many of the archaeological vessels with the ideo graphic script known as nsibidi. His research offers the possibil ity of a much greater time depth for this visual language, if not its symbolic associations. While there may be many places in Africa where changes in religious beliefs and practices has led to the abandonment of some pottery forms, there are other places where the ritual sig nificance of pots seems to endure. Judith Sterner, Nicholas David, Gavua Kodzo, and Scott MacEachern (David 1992; David et al. 1991; MacEachern 1994; Sterner 1989, 1995) have documented the central role of ceramics in all aspects of ritual and social life in the Mandara mountain region of northern Cameroon. Their research explores the strong and vital association between pots, people and the spirit world. Similarly, Silvia Forni's work with potters in several communi ties in Cameroon (2000-2001) is based on close observation of all 14 1 aplcan arts SPRING 2007</page><page sequence="3">aspects of pottery production and marketing, but is also informed by an anthropological focus on the meaning and significance of pottery within the social and spiritual lives of her informants. The focus of her article is on pottery production and use in the Grass fields kingdom of Babessi, where she argues that from birth to death and beyond, pots are important agents in social life. Their role shifts from humble to official, from male to female, from individual to communitarian according to the specific setting and occasion in which they are placed in the center of action. Laurel Aguilar was conducting research on Chewa men's ini tiation practices when she became aware of the parallel mythic and symbolic significance of women's pottery production. She describes some of the metaphorical associations embedded in the making of pottery and reflects on how these illustrate Chewa social values. Similarly, Lisa Aronson went to Ghana to do research on Ewe vodun body arts, only to find that pottery production provided a useful entree to understanding vodun practice. She documented the unusual technique the Anlo-Ewe of Ghana employ for build ing their everyday and ritual (Vodun) pots, which can be under stood as a visualization of the spiritual world, especially when seen in concert with the iconographic embellishment of the ves sels. As she suggests, this domain offers a great deal of potential for further research. While as researchers we may be drawn to a particular pot ter whose abilities seem to rise above the level of the others, most of the concern of art historians has been on understanding the larger cultural tradition within which they operate. There have been very few studies that focus on individual potters rec ognized for their exceptional artistry. When the British pot ter Michael Cardew first encountered the work of Ladi Kwali, a Gwari potter of Northern Nigeria, he was impressed by her skills manipulating clay: To watch Ladi Kwali building her pots by hand is an enlightenting experience, quite as stimulating as one's first sight of a good thrower at work. You realize with surprise that it is not necessary to have a potter's wheel in order to achieve pots which have the appearance of perfect symmetry. One also experiences ... the exhilaration of watch ing a craftsman who seems to be doing the impossible and to be always on the brink of disaster, yet is entirely unafraid, and entirely howI shewa tagh to~~ trw pos ton whee by Mihe Ca- J 'j dew Abua,rigpteriLa.i9 PHOTOGRAPH BY MICHAEL__ CONNER, 1978. confident with the confidence that comes from a lifetime of devotion to the craft. Crowning all this, her personal charm irradiates all her art and everything she does and seems to be the epitome of the deep seated culture of Africa (1972:35). Ultimately, Cardew taught Kwali how to throw on a potters' wheel (FIG. 7). Her glazed stoneware pots now in museum and private collections stand as an odd hybrid of African creativity and European intervention. The role of creativity within the traditional context of an indi vidual artist's work was the focus of Robert Farris Thompson's eloquent study of the Yoruba potter Abaitan Odefunke Ayinke Ija. He writes: I hope to demonstrate that two aspects of art, tradition and innova tion, normally held to be antithetical, form in her works a dynamic unity, that is, her art is embedded in culture and yet is autonomous. The problem of the expression of her individuality is perceived in time. Artistic development happens when an individual, after the mastery of the skills of his metier, surmounts this basic competence with continuous self criticism and change. In a world of non literate conservative bent, these innovations are perforce discreet, so as not to disturb a necessary illusion of the continuity of ethical truths in their abstract purity (1969:121-2). The existence of multiple examples of Abaitan's work along with pieces created by other potters within the same context allows Thompson the unusual opportunity to assess the creative range of the artist's work and change over time within her oeuvre. As he himself notes, however, "artistic biography depends on more than a few isolated samples just as a film cannot be considered where but two or three frames of the print survives" (ibid., p. 123). Artistic biography is the focus of Barbara Thompson's essay. She was engaged in doctoral research on Tanzanian healing prac tices when she encountered the potter Namsifueli Nyeki and her work in the market. In her essay, she describes how she became aware of the innovative way in which Nyeki adopted and trans formed various traditional pottery forms, and how her friend ship with this extraordinary woman ultimately came full circle to connect with her research on traditional healers. Our solicitation of Gary Van Wyk's interview with South Afri can potter, Clive Sithole, for this volume reflects our concern for how scant information is on contemporary ceramic artists from Africa.'2 The interview opens a window into a particular artist's inspiration, his curiosity and passion for the medium of clay, and his self-conscious respect for both tradition and innovation. In sum, the essays included in this issue bring attention to a field of study that is rich with potential, offering a range of approaches as models for future research. We end our introduc tion not with answers, but with questions. What as yet unknown relationships might be realized through the documenting and mapping of existing ceramic traditions? To what extent can we reconstruct the histories of vessels and of the potters who made them? Where do pots fit within changing symbolic systems of belief'? Do they continue to embody myths and metaphors of the past? Do they remain no more or less important than their pre decessors, do they take on a greater role in embodying memory in the decline or absence of figurative sculpture (on shrines, for example), or have their ritual associations become obsolete? In SPRING 2007 afrIcan art: 15</page><page sequence="4">a given cultural context, what is the nature of the relationship between ceramic arts and other expressive art forms such as body ornamentation, performance, and displays of status within the home? Where do the ceramic arts fit within the broader visual culture of contemporary life in Africa? What might we learn from knowing more of the life histories of individual potters, of variations in apprenticeship and learning patterns, of attitudes towards creativity and innovation? Within differing cultural sys tems what motivates exceptional potters? How is their artistry received within their own community? How might we better understand the intersection of ceramics with global markets today? When and how do vessels enter these markets and with what agency do potters engage with them? e Kathleen Bickford Berzock is curator of African art at the Art Institute of Chicago. kbickford@artic.edu Barbara E. Frank is associate professor of art history at Stony Brook Uni versity. bfrank@notes.cc.sunysb.edu Notes We would like to thank Lisa Aronson, Douglas Dawson, Kate Ezra, Adria LaViolette, and Jessica Levin Martinez for their constructive criticism in preparing this introduction. i With some exceptions, women dominate the craft of pottery production across Africa in historically known periods. The gender of potters and of the makers of figurative sculpture in the archaeological past is not known; however, both Berns (1993) and Frank (2002) have suggested that we should at least recognize the possibility that women may have played a role in the production of archaeological ceramics. 2 The impetus behind this special issue was the symposium "For Hearth and Altar: Artistry and Action in African Ceramics," held February 4, 2006, at the Art Institute of Chicago in conjunction with the exhibi tion "For Hearth and Altar: African Ceramics from the Keith Achepohl Collection." Organized by Kathleen Bickford Berzock, Maria Berns, and Barbara E. Frank, the symposium had two foci, one on individual art ists and the other on ritual as a locus of meaning and memory. The participants were Lisa Aronson, Maria Berns, Kathleen Bickford Berzock, Silvia Forni, Barbara Frank, Barbara Thompson, and Gary Van Wyk. The exhibition was on view at the Art Institute of Chicago Dec. 3, 2005-February 20, 2006. 3 There have been other exhibitions of African ceramics of varying scope, among them: "The Potters Art," Museum of Mankind, London (Picton and Fagg 1970); "African Terra Cottas South of the Sahara," Detroit Institute of Arts, 1972; "Nupe, Kakanda, Basa Nge: Gef?sskeramik aus Zentral-Nigeria" (St?ssel 1981a) and "Keramik aus Westafrika: Einf?hrung in Hersterllung und Gebrauch" (St?ssel 1981b), Gallerie Biedermann and Galerie Fred Jahn, Munich; "Anthro pomorphic Terracotta Vessels of Zaire" (Polfliet 1987a) and "Traditional Zairian Pottery" (Polfliet 1987b), Galerie Fred Jahn, 1987; "Fired Brilliance: Ceramic Ves sels from Zaire," University of Missouri-Kansas City Art Gallery (Darish 1990); "African Ceramics: Ancient and Historic Earthenware Vessels" (Dawson 1993), "Of the Earth: Ancient and Historic African Ceramics" (Dawson 2001) and "The Art of African Clay: Ancient and Historic African Ceramics" (Dawson 2003), Doug las Dawson Gallery, Chicago; "Women's Art in Africa: Woodfired Pottery from Iowa Collections," University of Iowa Art Museum, 1994; "Earthen Vessels: Central and West African Works of Fired Clay," Anderson Gallery, Drake University, 1996 (Anderson Gallery 1996); "Hier et Aujourd'hui: des Poteries et des Femmes," Mus?um d'histoire naturelle, Gen?ve and Mus?e National, Bamako (Gallay et al. 1996); "Earthen Elegance: African Ceramics from the Newark Museum Collection," New ark Museum, 2004-05; "West African Ceramic Vessels," Indianapolis Museum of Art, 2006-07; and Indiana University Art Museums rotating series of African ceramics installations, 2001-present. 4 Siebers catalogue (1980) and the exhibition it accompanied were also pivotal for presenting ceramics and other utilitarian forms as aesthetic objects in their own right. 5 Mali's Inland Niger Delta is perhaps the most richly treated in this fashion. Zulu pottery, from South Africa, is also beginning to attain a critical mass of studies. 6 For instance Frank 1994,1998; Roy 1989, 2000a, 2000b, 2003; and Schneider 1986,1990,1993,1997. It is interesting to note that in many instances studies from the 1970s or before remain the standard in their area. Notable examples include Dias 1961, Lawton 1967, Trow ell and Wachsmann 1953, and Waane 1976. 7 In his detailed and illuminating analysis of the African art market, Christopher Steiner (1994) discusses the role of art traders as cultural brokers who benefit from maintaining the separation between the sellers and buyers. 8 Forni also discussed Fombah in her paper "Improving Tradition Through Innovation: Mar tin Fombah and the Contemporary Potters of Nsei" presented at the Art Institue of Chicago symposium "For Hearth and Altar: Artistry and Action in African Ceramics," February 4,2006. 9 Koloss s definitive consideration of the chiefdom of Oku (2000), with its numerous photographs and descriptions of ritual, is also a valuable record of pottery use. Gebauer (1979) suggests the complexity of intercon nections among the arts of the closely related cultures in Western Cameroon. 10 Some of the techniques identified include pounding in concave mold: Sonrai, Dogon (Tireli), Dogon (Ka-In Ouro); pounding in concave mold and molding over convex mold: Peul, northern Bamana; pounding and modeling in concave mold: north ern Somono; modeling over convex mold: southern Bamana, Dogon (Modjodje), Dogon (Sarnyere); model ing in concave mold: southern Somono; and pounding out a lump: Bobo, and Dogon (Niongono) 11 Similar sustained collaborative ethnoarchaeologi cal research has been undertaken in the Mandara region of Cameroon under the direction of Nicholas David and Judith Sterner from the University of Calgary in the 1980s and 1990s (David and Sterner 1987,1989,1998), and by Olivier Gosselain, Alexandre Livingstone Smith, and their colleagues in northern Cameroon on the Ceramic and Society Project 1994-99 under the direction of Pierre de Maret at the University of Brussels (Gosselain et al 1996; see also Gosselain 1998,1999,2000). Impor tant individual ethnoarchaeological studies have also been done in Senegal (Gu?ye 1997-1998, Sail 2000-2001). 12 Magdalene Odundo remains the perhaps the only artist of African origin whose name is widely associated with contemporary ceramic arts (Berns 1995). There is also some information on El Anatsuis early work in clay (Oguibe 1998), although he is much better known for his more recent signature works in wood and multime dia. Ethiopian artist Etyi? Dimma Poulsen is known as a sculptor rather than a ceramic artist per se, even though her primary medium is clay (see Harney 2003). References cited Allsworth-Jones, P. 1996.
