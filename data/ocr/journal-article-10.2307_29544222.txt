I am not referring here to dis? posable architectures but to that pow? erful and ubiquitous by-product of our discipline: its rhetoric. In comedy, the 'throw-away' is the line of a joke casually tossed aside - a supplement to that essential excess from which humour arises. Yet, at its most tuned, it becomes the 'swerve' of humour, a lateral force that pounces upon the waiting listener. Marx (the other one) was a specialist in the throw-away, and through it demon? strated the seriousness of humour as a practice and the self-effacement re? quired of the comedian as its author. Most importantly, in the hands of an acerbic post-homo-ludens such as Andy Kauffman or Lenny Bruce, humour becomes a Nietzschean hammer to be wielded against conventional wisdom. And, against the robust but leaking edifice of reason, the throw-away is an ambush that is far more effective than a frontal assault. Similarly, the archi? tectural throw-away is especially useful against architecture, a field that serves as a cultural paragon of convention? ality while struggling with its internal conventions of construction practice and representation. Given this understanding, some of 79</page><page sequence="2">modern architecture's most effective fabrications - machines ? habiter, 'less is more', Duck-architecture - operate as throw-aways. That we tend to render these asides conventional through rep? etition, draining them of all force until they become the empty 'catch phrases' of hacks, suggests both a collective lack of humour and the need to cultivate a greater sense of irony within the discipline. This introduction (itself instantly dis? posable) is necessary for two reasons: firstly, the objects of this review are - in a good sense - throw-aways; sec? ondly, these books invoke a favourite throw-away of a practising architect. Zaha Hadid once declared that, for architects, the difficulty of science fiction lay in its nostalgia for past architectures. Forget that Hadid's work is too often labelled 'futuristic' by facile critics, or that her early work in part extended an incomplete architecture programme formulated in the early decades of this century. Think instead of Blade Runner's art deco, neo Egyptian, Wrightian pastiche. It was specifically to this film that Hadid was referring, incredulous at the misprision of its retro-urbanism as visionary and thus as the object of architects' envy. In what would appear to be an unrelated critique, Paul Virilio has described how, in the film Aliens, the director James Cameron purposely employed the technology of the present in futuristic settings in order to heighten the sense of terror and the spectacle of violence. In a sublime movement, the alien becomes recognizable as such when it enters into - or is, literally, pierced by - what Deleuze calls the 'logic of the Same', that is to say when radical differences are sublimated by the familiar. The architecture of sci-fi can perform reciprocally, contextual izing exotic technologies with nostalgic (Star Wars, Blade Runner) or banal (Terminator, The Matrix) settings. The exotic future of architecture is 'the Same', but more so: pyramids with video screens. Films look backwards to create a convincing future that in turn reassures us of architecture's timeless and universal essence. The full title of Out of Time: Designs for the Twentieth Century Future begs the question of architecture's relation? ship to its cinematic representation. Norman Brosterman ostensibly offers a survey of science fiction illustration and production design. Similar in format to many other of the publisher's products, its qualities derive from a combination of light treatment, encyclopaedic scope and large visual reproductions. Un? fortunately, these pleasures are miti? gated by a graphic design that can only be described as faux Mechanics Illustrated chic. Successfully combining the hyperactive with the heavy handed, the design precipitates the text into the domain of kitsch. And in this, only the cover illustration conveys any degree of post-ironic wit. For all this there are moments of insight in both the text and in the visual material. It would be possible, in the spirit of Baudrillard's Le Systeme des objets, to employ the text as an economic typology of futurist forms: from the illogically aerodynamic to a strangely Wittkowerian obsession with spheres and circles, to predilections for forced perspectives and oblique angles. However, for the architect, the most interesting moments occur as unin? tentional folds of architectural history, or as a blurring between 'proper' architectural drawing and illustration. For example, Moholy-Nagy's 1936 design for the film Things to Come appears as an uncompromised Mod? ernist vision - a future replete with skyways, glass elevators and interior canyons of curvilinear space. In other words, it uncannily anticipates the architecture of John Portman who, in this delirious genealogy, appears as the heir apparent of the Bauhaus pro? gramme. A Modernist urban Utopia is thus enfolded with and revealed as the model for what Frederic Jameson made the most infamous icon of Post Modern simulacra. Such twists of the Modernist tale give force to Rem Koolhaas's admonition that 'serious' architects should examine the work of commercial firms more closely. A more disturbing section concerns the work of Leydenfrost, an emigre illustrator whose work spans exhibition design, book illustration and cinema. In the 1950s, he turned his skill to visualizing the assemblage of nuclear technology and the post-war metro? polis. His work is a reminder of the way in which this city has been equal partner in the reterritorialization of space by military-industrial complexes. Here, entertainment, urbanism and warfare seamlessly merge in a heroic and fearsome urban topography. The second book, Robo sapiens, is a glossy coffee-table book published by the mighty MIT Press. The unfortu? nate neologism of its title aside, it raises a series of important and complex questions regarding the now totally eclipsed dichotomies of the human and the machine, the born and the made, the living and the dead. The authors' thesis is a simplification of that found in Manuel Delanda's War In The Age of Intelligent Machines', that an entirely new kingdom of (artificial) life is emerging. This matured 'machinic phylum' (to borrow a term from Deleuze and Guattari) announces a post-humanist epoch both in the sense of disrupting the waning ideologies of Modernism, and in literally displacing the onto logical status of the human, the natural and the virtual. Pitched as a 'field-guide', it intro? duces the vast scope of global robotic research through short vignettes and interviews with individual or teams of scientists. Comparative statistics and uses - given the gee-whiz term, 'Robo Specs' - are provided; these resemble those found in lad magazines as much AA FILES 43</page><page sequence="3">as those that cause the other sort of ornithologist to salivate. One imagines a pubescent Dr Strangelove finding this text in his father's shed -'Look, over there, on page 89! It's a rare blue bellied ACM R-i, 200-i5-20cm, with 20 bi-rotation articulations. It enjoys remote sensing and slow rides in hostile terrain'. Given the world wide web of nerds and porn addicts, perhaps the format of a licentiousness field-guide should have been exploited. Instead, the texts' earnest reportage and passive fetishism becomes its greatest problem. One of the authors is a photo journalist, and it shows. The book is dominated by immense full-page close ups of shiny-happy Japanese scientists, earnest American super-geeks, and scowling German technicians. Each holds - or rather, caresses - a silicon and aluminium creation. The sheer repetition and consistency of lighting, framing and subject-matter has the same disorienting effect Life magazine once offered middle America in its coverage of atrocities and genocide. Sprawling Kodachrome naturalism provides false reassurance of mastery over the image if not the event. Similarly, the text bizarrely focuses upon the biography and idiosyncrasies of the scientists, rendering their work as little more than the product of the Faustian scientist-genius. Typical ob? jections - 'it's all funded by the military'- are brushed aside with a reassuring, condescending, but invis? ible hand. Only the 'Robo-Specs' and passing descriptions of institutions, entertainment-military connectivity, conditions of practice and webs of discourse suggest the far richer ecology of multi-national corporate science. Ultimately, by recuperating its ma? terial into an expository narrative of romantic humanism, replete with heroic scientists, the text can only mystify its thesis. But if you find the Dona Haraway brand of Cyborg Manifesto (DHCM) a tad too socialist AA FILES 43 and Delanda's post-structuralism too haute couture, this book targets your demographic as a future customer at Gap for Replicants. Everyone in Kevlar. Yet, in spite of these faults, Robo sapiens does foreground a question that architects have recently come to con? sider: how would one design for Cyborgs? After reading this text, one understands the practical, epistemo logical and ontological implications of this thought experiment. How does the technologically transformed human, or indeed our wholesale replication and displacement, transform traditional re? lationships to the body and typologies of architecture? If the humanist subject is now a Cyborg, how does this affect a field so heavily invested into humanist systems of representation and order such as architecture? In both texts, one issue that emerges is that of scale. The architectures of Out of Time are consistently gargantuan and dispro? portionate. Of course, today, larger exemplars of 'bigness' are regularly constructed and the human scale has, to a great extent, become a moot area of research. But it is representation, not empirical size, that is at issue. The renderings and perspectives in Out of Time that relate to film ensure not only that architecture is estranged from its human characters, but also that it has aesthetic effects upon the viewer. As Andrew Benjamin has noted in 'Housing the Future' (his recently re published analysis of Blade Runner) it is the scale of the built environment that registers the displacement of a Mod? ernist subject in the narrative and in the Replicant characters. The uncanny replication of the human in the Cyborg is complemented by the sublime effect of the architecture on the film's spec? tator. Psychically, this not only pro? vides the pleasures of the fearsome and the dreadful but also allows the viewer to capture and enclose this fearsome sight, literally sublimating it and incorporating it into its new, expanded but nevertheless whole state. Scale and subject operate differently in Robo sapiens, many of the simulacra it presents are anthropomorphic robots that mimic the size and shape of an adult human, a child or pet. The scien? tists frequently argue that the impor? tance of such work lies not in engineering applications nor as pure science but in the fulfilment of a dual role: on the one hand, the anthro? pomorphic automaton satisfies public expectations fuelled by cinema; on the other, it expands public empathy and tolerance for artificial life-forms. As with the gigantism of sci-fi archi? tectures, this uncanny anthropomor? phic doubling operates according to a recursive sublime in which a threat to the subject allows that subject ulti? mately to enclose it. From the wizened framework of critical theory, this is a case study in the manufacture of consent. Hence, the second crucial scale is not the gargantuan but the minus? cule. Unsurprisingly, these micro-robots attract a different breed of robotician as they do not rely on hierarchical organization, intelligent programming nor even digital technology, but analogue neural networks, heuristic distributed learning and robust redundancy. Their champion, Mark Tilden, operates according to the paradigm christened by Kevin Kelly as 'the fast, the cheap, and the out of control'. Prodigious and far more radical than most of the other species in this field book, such technologies can produce millions of (almost) self reproducing machines. Individually they are dumb and ineffective, but when combined they offer an organi? zation capable of surprising operations. Menzel and D'Aluisio's most compelling image is imaginary, wherein robots cover the earth like dust, performing their labour unnoticed by human eyes. Like the unbounded lichen that was recently declared the Earth's largest organism, these forms of life 81</page><page sequence="4">completely supersede scale, the organic body and its humanistic framework of projective representation. These books are throw-aways in the sense that they are consumable. Their use for architecture is not in legiti? mating our work, providing images of the future, or as a model of the Zeitgeist which we chase with our symbols and metaphors. Instead, their architectural interest lies in the way they can be redeployed as markers of the degree to which architecture is already precip? itated into the cybernetic world of sublime dissimulation. Moreover, they suggest that our continued fascination with the virtual realities of sci-fi or the high-tech betrays a profound nostalgia. That the future should resemble architecture's past - be that the art deco mechanism of Blade Runner, the modernism of Alphaville, or the Victorian Gothic of Brazil - is something that we find oddly com? forting and, to return to Hadid's terse observation, this suggests the need to reverse a common delusion that archi? tecture lags behind. Indeed, it reveals the bankrupt Hegelian historicism necessary even to suggest that we are perpetual latecomers, not to mention the self-pity this illusion engenders. We declare a crisis (as Banham put it, to 'run with technology' or face obsol? escence) but perpetually delay our engagement. How often do we hear that architecture is more complicated, confronts 'real stuff, and is therefore necessarily slower than other modes of cultural production, a statement which, like a middle-aged parent, exalts in its rear-guard conservatism? If, to paraphrase a throw-away of Rem Koolhaas, the architect combines omniscience with impotence, then we also combine arrogance with self loathing. Like Groucho Marx, we would not want to join any club that would have us as members. This is not to deny the continual need for renovation and innovation. It is, however, to suggest reformulating the problem such that the potential - and responsibility - for invention is understood as already possible within architecture, rather than envied fields such as film or techno-science. Such a move does not entail a simplistic re? action against the image, nor does it imply disciplinary solipsism. On the contrary, it suggests how much we have to gain from a closer and more critical rapprochement with the archi? tectonic imago, that is, the image of architecture which at once we project and which traces the contoured limits of our discipline. To that end, these texts are high-carb snacks to fuel the ongoing cross-training of the discipline. Burn what you can as energy, excrete the rest, pick up the wrapper on your way out and throw it away.</page></plain_text>
