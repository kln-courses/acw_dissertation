THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS OF THIS QUEST A. INTRODUCTION It is both an honour and a pleasure for me to be given this oppor- tunity to speak to you on this auspicious occasion of the Anniversary of Shri Ramkrishna Gopal Bhandarkar. An honour I consider it for me to occupy this rostrum which has been graced by the distinguished scholars that have preceded me upon it ; an honour to address such a select audience attuned to the best of scholarship and culture ; and a special honour to do that under the auspices of this Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute which so fittingly not only bears the name but - what is more - represents and continues to live the scholarly spirit of that giant of Indian learning - Shri R. G. Bhandarkar - of whom, if of any one, we can justly say " defunctus adhuc loquitur " - though departed, he still speaks to us. His whole scholarly life and work speaks to us a mighty word of encouragement on to a catholic openmindedness, a never-tiring investigation and thoroughness of infor- mation and an impartial balance of judgement that is the best mental panoply with which to approach, appraise arid discriminatingly sift - like him - the manifold accumulated deposits of the cultural history of this ancient land of ours. May his memory and the drawing power of his noble example never grow less ! * Sir R. G. Bhandarkar Anniversary Address : 8th September, 1967,</page><page sequence="2">2 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute But besides being an honour this occasion is a great joy to me, for it is something of a home-coming. It is this way: the spirit of Bhandarkar and of the Bhandarkar Institute is surely best incarnated, as in a tangible " avatära in the text-critical edition of the mighty Mahãbhãrata , that masterpiece of Indian scholarship, borne on the shoulders of that " Bhandarkar II, " as I may be allowed to call the late-lamented Dr. Y. S. Sukthankav, the eminent first and truly foundation-laying editor of that outstanding work in its present form. And it was precisely about the time when Dr. Sukthankar was struggl- ing through the initial difficulties of his cyclopean task that I was being introduced into the study of Sanskrit by an intimate friend and fellow-labourer of his, ( as member of his editorial Board ) Rev. Fr. R. Zimmermann, S. J., Professor of Sanskrit at St. Xavier' s College, Bombay, of whom Dr. Sukthankar himself later wrote in his epoch- making " Prolegomena" : " But I desire to make a special mention of my indebtedness to Mr. V. P. Vaidya, Bar-at-law, of Bombay, and the late Fr. R. Zimmermann, S. J., whose advice and ready help accompanied my labours from the time I first undertook the responsibilities of this work. The interest of my late-lamented fellow-student and friend, Fr. Zimmermann, in this project did not flag even as he lay, in 1931, in a Nursing Home at Feldkirch, waiting prepared to meet his Maker ! Nothing encouraged me more in the early stages of this arduous and fascinating work than the active and unwavering interest with which those two friends followed it." At the time when this eminent ex- alumnus of my College was writing this noble epitaph for the one who was my teacher and predecessor in the same institution, I was imbibing ( at the feet of their common renowned Guru, Dr. H. Lüders of the Berlin University ) the very same principles of thorough textual criti- cism that Dr. Sukthankar had so successfully brought to bear upon the Mahãbhãrata . Those studies awakened in me a special interest in text-criticism, which bore their first fruits in my doctoral Thesis on " The original recension of the Mahãnãtakam " ( which was published in the series of " Abhandlungen " of the German Oriental Society - D. M. G. ) of which I presented a copy to what I might call my senior " sahodara-áisya Dr. Sukthankar, on my return from Berlin. Those ties, both institutional and of scholarly bent, strengthened by personal friendship with Dr. Sukthankar, are the ones which make me feel that my presence in this Institute today is something of a home- coming-home to the home of the spirit embodied in the text-critical edition of the Mahãbhãrata , which is the spirit that has partly inspired all my work in the field of textual criticism for the last nearly forty years. In fact for a time " the arduous and fascinating work " of the Mahãbhãrata text-critical study lured me into its orbit, and its fruits were some extensive articles and later a final reconsideration of their</page><page sequence="3">The Quest for the Original Rgveda â contents through a doctoral thesis ( on the text-critical problems in the " Suparnãkhyãna " ) by one of my students, Dr. M. M. Mehta - for which thesis I had the pleasure of having as fellow-referee the present General Editor of the Mahãbhãrata , my friend, Dr. P. L. Vaidya. B. THE DAWN OF THIS QUEST But overriding all the attraction towards classical and epic texts there was a sort of " love at first sight" which had sprung up in my scholar's heart from my early contacts with the text-critical proble- matic of the Rgveda - of which I had had a first inkling while under Dr. Liiders' guidance. 1. The Paradox of the metrical Flaws That love had come to me like in a flash of inspiration, which showed me with intuitional clarity a paradox that demanded a rational explanation : how was it possible that the very same rsi-kavis who could elaborate verse after verse of perfect pattern-true regularity, should abruptly go limp and lame, and unaccountably fail in the most essential factors of versification and rhythm ? Oh, I knew that the standard answer was there : " you see, those were primitive-early versifiers, and they hobbled along their rhythmical verse -patterns in a more or less approximative way, not much minding anomalous next-best near-misses But my whole being and literary experience ( both passive and active ) revolted against stomaching such a glib answer. For, if those poets were so primitive how could they achieve such obvious mastery of the language and skill in versification manifested in whole rows of perfectly regular verses - and, vice-versa , if they could and did achieve such easy-flowing perfection and regularity with such dexterously handled and resourceful language- material, how could these then flop so suddenly, miserably and unaccountably ? That involved, surely, a psychological paradox if there ever was one ! 2. Redactorial Indications Besides, the more familiarly acquainted I was becoming with the text of the Rgveda as a whole, the clearer appeared the imprints of redactorial handling ( and even mis-handling ) in an extraordinarily complicated system of arrangement and re-arrangement. Its full elucidation we have gratefully to ascribe to the classically trained and methodical scrutiny of Western scholarship, culminating in that un- surpassed masterpiece of vedic text-critical learning-H. Oldenberg's " Prolegomena ". ( And, by the way, it is a standing reproach and loss to Indian vedic scholarship that the latter has not yet thought it worth its while to get that work translated at least into English - " videant cónsules " ! )</page><page sequence="4">4 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute Furthermore, an attentive reading of the Rgveda as verse brought very soon home to me - and Oldenberg's "Prolegomena" deepened that re-action - that the whole text had been ruthlessly tampered with by a redactorial agency which had systematically imposed upon the archaic text an unnatural and un-original set of samdhi rules and phonetic pronunciation ( and later, consequently, transcription ) which were com- pletely at variance with the rsi-kavis' own speech-habits - naturally so, as being the product of a far younger stage of the language and of a pre- but semi-pãninean type of grammar which had not yet been born in th % far older rsi-kavis' own period of rgvedic composition and living linguistic usage. Arnold was right when he-as is well-known-stated that if you take the Samhitä-Kära's ( SK, for short ) phonetic rendering of the Rgveda literally as it lies, half of the Samhitä, at least, changes from " rg " to " bhäsya " from " padya " to " gadya ", from rhythmic verse to pedestrian sheer prose . No bonder that I could come across people like that distinguished non-Indian vedic scholar who told me plainly that he habitually read the Rgveda as mere prose. He was certainly wrong, but ( from the point of view of the Samhitä " as she is wrote " ) he was more logical than many another scholar-who continues to treat the Samhitä as if it were verse, while meekly acquiescing in the phonetic rendering that belies its traditional and (by the rsi-kavis' grace-against the SK's distortion!) triumphantly true title of " 777-veda ", veda of the " reas " or rhythmical verses . In a way all my "quest after the original Rgveda " for the past close on forty years has been an endeavour to restore to its fullness the truth of that title. And that is why some of you have already often read or heard from me that the present Samhitä text, the oldest one that a traditional " paramparä" of oral áruti-transmission has preserved for us, is only a " palimpsest ", a re-written or worked over version that to a large extent covers, disguises and at times even distorts the original Rgveda of the rsi-kavis - but a palimpsest that, by dint of persevering and systematic text-critical restoration and emendation, can still be restituted, from under the layers of that traditional overlying sediment, to its original archaic form. In short I am claiming for the Rgveda the feasibility of a miracle of rejuvenation-by-restoration similar to the one operated on the Mahãbhãrata text (and more recently - in its image and likeness-on the Rãmãyana one too ) by the text-critical scholarly work öf Dr. Sukthankar and his able collaborators and successors - in this very Institute - by sifting the gold of the original text from the dross of the superimposed additaments and distortions. The latter come from eager and well-meaning would-be editors and redactors, whose zeal for ever- new improvement of their traditional literature led them to love it all</page><page sequence="5">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 5 too well even though not wisely. Yet how vividly I remember some incidents of the years when Sukthankar's " Adiparvan " was fresh from the presses and when I had to bear the brunt of indignation coming from otherwise educated Indian persons who could not bear to hear that such a brilliant and scholarly rescue work and transfiguring purification could be anything but desecration ! How the times have changed! Who can nowadays but rejoice that such a Cyavana-like wonder of rejuvena- tion-by-restoration has been performed upon the two national Sanskrit epics ! Is it too much to expect that a similar transformation may one day accrue to that " cüdämani " of Indian Sanskrit Literature which is the Rgveda ? C. FACTORS OF THE PROBLEM 1. Indian redactorial Dynamism For the above two general features ( of the rgvedic redactorial arrangement and the all-pervading and all-distorting extraneous samdhi-system) bear loud testimony to the fact that the same characteri- stic redactorial genius of Indian literary transmission that went so obviously to work upon the two national epics was true to its inborn character not only in the making of the Sariihitä but also in the most ancient pre-Samhitã period of the Rgveda tradition too. Indeed the most typical characteristic of Indian literary transmission has always been ( as witness the two national epics, chiefly but not only ) a dynamically redactorial attitude towards the transmitted text-not a statically echo- repetitive one. So much so that the strictly gramophone-like, echo-like transmission of the post-Samhitã rgvedic and other vedic schools is an extraordinary and peculiar phenomenon within the general trend of Sanskrit literary tradition which requires special explanation. That explanation lies surely in its connexion with the evolution of the sacri- ficial theories and practice. But even within the stream of the vedic schools the multiple proliferation of áãkhãs ( with their different Samhitäs, Brãhmanas, etc., in different recensions, as well as the later sütras, commentaries and sub-commentaries without end ) proves that the essential genius of Indian literary transmission has always been not passively receptive but receptively dynamic and modifyingly redactorial-something like the current of the mighty Ganga, which at every stage of its course is met, Yamunã-like, by ever new affluents : and, like the latter, Indian tradition does not rest content with the mere receiving of the riches of the main stream of the past, but is eager at each stage to contribute its own tinge and taste and texture to the common flood, which thus remains ever continuously one and yet ever gradually different, in an ever-evolving encyclopedic ( and even at times bewilderingly heterogeneous ) combination of the old and the new. The very tradition-bound love for the old lore makes it imperative for each</page><page sequence="6">6 Annals of the Êhandarkar Oriental Èesearch institute new cultural-literary generation to enhance and embellish and update it, so that it is evermore a repository of all that is best, and thu3 can speak to each new generation in the living accents of its own conception of the ideal and the beautiful without the blemish of faded and shri- velled decrepitude of form or content. That is precisely what happened in the case of the two national epics, and that was also the compelling force which (in the Šákalaáakha) led to the final shaping of that redactorial edition of the traditional rgvedic hymns which we commonly call the Rg-veda-Sa?)Mitã and which I term the Samhitã-Palimpsest. That it is a Palimpsest all modern scholars are agreed - at least to the extent, -as we have said-that, in its present phonetic presentation and above all in its samdhi, it is a re- written or better reshaped and re-edited text superimposed on the original one by the systematically re-dactorial agency of the Šakalya- school which we call by the collective name of Samhitä-Kära. ( = SK). But the problem remains : how far did that redactorial agency go both in its ultimate representatives, the shaper-editors of our present Samkitä and, above all, in its predecessors through the previous stages, from the age of composition right down to the final redaction ? Was it only phonetics, prosody and Samdhi that were redactorially affected or did the alteration and palimpsesting reach far beyond that to the very words, contents and tenor of the text-just as it did happen in the two national epics ? 8. Indian Cultural Setting In order to give a more completely satisfactory answer to that funda- mental question we shall have to get a more integral concept of the nature of the Rgveda and of its place in the frame of the total cultural background which brought it forth. India of the II millenium before the Christian era was not a cultural vacuum : the Indus valley civilisation for instance had flourished and partly declined when it was overflooded and partly gradually assimi- lated by the cultural-linguistic immigration of the Indo-Aryans. This new invading wave was the one that gave the predominant tinge and savour to what we can call the Hindu-Indian Culture - the one embodied in the literatures of Sanskrit and of the other related Indo-Aryan languages, Pali and the Prakrits. The bearers of this new cultural cycle, the Indo-Aryas, were linguistic-cultural twins of the Aryas of Iran, ( with whom they had been in close contact before entering into India ) and brothers, not progenitors, of the other scions of the prolific Indo- European mother-tongue, like Greek, Latin, Celtic, Germanic and Baltic- Slavic-which in their further expansion and evolution covered the continent of Europe and beyond, while the Indo-Aryas were penetrating into the Indian sub-continent.</page><page sequence="7">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 7 Thus the Indo-Aryan language in its oldest, the Vedic, type entered into India from beyond the Himalayan ranges and through the North-West ( Punjab ) some time about the middle of the second millenium B. 0. The oldest work extant of its literature, the Rgveda , - in the linguistic texture that it had acquired, say, about the XIII-X c. B. C. - was then handed down by an oral tradition which in its definitive form ( dating from about the VI- V c. , B. 0. ) constitutes what we could rightly call a unique linguistic-literary miracle wrought by the Indo-Aryan genius and a just title to glory for the Hindu-Indian culture, as we shall see further on. The Indo-Aryan clans who created and bequeathed to us that vedic literature were a robust, dynamic people, semi-civilized ( from the urban point of view ) semi-nomadic and predominantly pastoral. They conquered the representatives of the previous Indian cultures- among them chiefly the Indus valley civilization, which was of a pre- dominantly urban sedentary and agricultural character of the Sumerio- Babylonian type. This led slowly to a gradual and mutually enriching miscegenation, both biological and cultural, which is shown only in its very initial stages in the rgvedic literature. The invading Indo-Aryas were not only an enterprising conquer- ing people, but they also formed a more or less loosely organised complex of clans and classes ( still far from the rigidity of the later castes ) with a general community of culture. They were as a whole naturally religious with that naturalness with which " homo rationalis " instinc- tively-logically becomes " homo religiosus since he realizes that he is not the ultimate sufficient explanation either of his own self or of the surrounding nature, but that some Intelligent superhuman power must be the true Source and Cause of all the surprising effects he experiences and observes in his own person, power and intelligence and in the world around and at large. The rgvedic man's religiosity is expressed mostly as a natural- istic polytheism , readily personifying the forces and phenomena of nature, and at the same time is constantly in search, more or less expli- citly, of one unique and unifying cause- getting glimpses of it in the concept of a supreme God of heaven, in whom he strives to see the ruler and controller of the universe and of its orderliness as well as of the human and moral order. Something like that is the great King-God Varuna, even when considerably upstaged by the preponderance given in those times of conflict and conquest to the warrior-god Indra. ( The above were the first adumbrations of later and more profound religious metaphysics, whose early attempts we find reflected in the few philoso- phico-religious hymns of the youngest rgvedic layers ),</page><page sequence="8">8 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute The rgvedic religiosity found its embodiment in the natural human expression of vocal praise and prayer-petition and in the gesture of sacrificial offering- &amp; reflection and projection of its attitude towards the pre-eminent and predominant personalities in the human society. Thus the rgvedic religiosity gravitated more and more around its con- crete symbol, so universally employed in religious cultures everywhere, the oblation- sacrifice, through which man has always tended to seal with his ritual offering the gesture of his submission to the deity, his dependence upon it, and his desire for its propitiation. And it was precisely here that already very soon the richly endowed genius of the Indo- Aryan people embellished and enhanced the sacrifice not only with a reverent ritual of sacred etiquette enveloping the sacrifice as a divine banquet, but also with solemn invocation, invi- tation, eulogy and petition of favours by means of recited poems exquisitely framed with the best possible rhythmical-literary craftsman- ship. To this was still added the ornament of sung-psalmody - so that in this way the sacrificial oblation might be turned into a symbolical gesture truly worthy of the deity as enlivened and enhanced by all the most expressive elements of man's total-integral language : the poetic refined word ; the courteously measured ritual gesture , and the sacred musical melody. In very early times a single performer enacted these three functional aspects ; but as the sacrifice gained in importance and evolved its professional technique ( on its way to later extreme complications and elaborations without end ) there arose three specialities in the sacrificial " know-how " or " veda " : the " Rg-veda, " or knowledge of the recited hymns or psalms ; the " &amp;ãma-veda or knowledge of the psalmody and its melodies ; and the " Yajur-ve da " or knowledge of the formulas, rites and ceremonies of the " yajfia, " worship. As it is but natural the word ( " vãk, vacas " ) of the prayer- formula ( " brahma " ) constitutes as it were the radical and primordial expression of the religious experience and therefore forms its principal part and substratum. Hence it is not to be wondered at that the Indo-Aryan people - a born artist of the spoken word ( as we know from its literary creations ) and an intelligent admirer of its power of expres- sion - should have attributed to it a capital importance in the matter of attracting the divine favour and of giving decisive efficacy to its peti- tions and sacrifices. After all this was again just a projection of their daily experience in dealing with the potentates of their human world. As a consequence., right from very early times the religious poets ( " rsis, kavis " ) that were outstanding in their virtuosity stood high in the Indo-Aryaá esteem and were avidly sought after. And, again as a consequence of this, there grew amongst those rsi-kavis a keenly</page><page sequence="9">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 9 vying competition with a view to being selected as the official mouth- piece for the solemn sacrifices of the clan sponsored by the leaders or notables. And the competition was so keen because on the one hand it was a sheer matter of prestige - since the success of the rites was greatly if not mainly credited to their appropriate intervention and propitiating influence. But, besides, the consequent remunerations ( " daksinã " ) in those times of dynamic conquest were very generous as the Vedic texts themselves abundantly attest through their dithyrambic " dãna-stutis " in praise of the " daksinã " received. 3. Transmission Wear-and-Tear Hence, naturally enough, the compositions that had been awarded the prize of final choice and preference in those open kavi competitions were then zealously and jealously treasured, repeated, and learned and thus subsequently transmitted from father to son in the families of the rgvedic rsi-kavis-for, since they had proved their successful worth, they were a precious inheritance and heirloom and a guarantee of both pre- stige and of a source of income and prosperity. Yet in the long run this was bound to tend towards turning an inspired literary art into a mere professional mechanical craftsmanship of memory work and of uninspired and uninspiring imitation both in versification without the spirit of poetry and also in a soulless repeti- tion that thoughtlessly slurs over the finer and more difficult points and words especially when they are in the process of becoming obsolete and hence more and more unintelligible. And this deterioration was bound to set in within that oral family -tradition because the step from poet to pedant can be as short as the one from the sublime to the ridiculous in the case of passing from gifted father to a pedestrian son and on to a mere professional verse-peddler of a grandson. This will appear as all the more convincing and decisive if we recollect that we are dealing with compositions in an archaic-literary style of a language that is beginning a period of rapid evolution- owing to a swift expan- sion and the influence of a pre-äryan linguistic substratum. Besides, as we know, it is precisely in the transit from mouth to ear and ear to mouth that the forms of speech perpetually tend to wear out and chip at the edges, and that words and turns of phrase disappear or change semantically. And all this applies also, even if with some modification, to the oral transmission of traditional texts in the ordinary course of things - unless, as we shall see, something very extraordinary happens to prevent the linguistically normal wear and tear. Hence it is but natural that in the course of many generations (with ups and downs of prestige and postergation, prosperity and want, patronage and neglect, emigrations, conquests and defeats ) we should 2 [ Annals, B, O. R. I. ]</page><page sequence="10">10 Annals of the Bhandarlcar Oriental Research Institute expect to find the texts in a relatively worn out state of deterioration in spite of the conservative vested interests which more or less success- fully strove to preserve the " status quo " of the traditional texts. It is not necessary to appeal for confirmation to the case of the written transmission of the epics. We can much more germanely point to the oral transmission of the Paippalãda Atharvaveda recension to show to what extent a far-reaching amount of deterioration can set in even under rather favourable conditions of controlled transmission of vedic texts. Sacrificial Decadence But there intervened in this process another important deteriora- ting factor: the decadence of the vedic sacrifice itself as a religious institution as testified especially in its transition into magic in and through the Yajurveda on to the Brãhmaiia literature as a whole. Man's selfishness indeed is instinctively prone everywhere to change religion - which, as we said, is naturally-logically primordial in man, and which essentially involves submission to the deity - to change it, we say, into some sort of magic , which magic is a subsequent and secondary reaction and consists in the attitude by which man tries to impose his dictate upon the super-humanly divine power. Religion therefore is iAeo-centric, magic omčAro^o-centric. Aud here also the step from the religious sublime to the ridiculous of magic is a short one - short for the instinctive-blind egocentrism of human passion. We shall try and see it reflected in the retrograde evolution of the vedic sacrifice. But this decay we shall find confirmed not only by the vedic texts themselves as pointed out above, but also by the two spiritual antisacrificial revolu- tions in ancient India - the one orthodox, of the Upanisads, those late- vedic theosophico-philosophical texts that resolutely turned their back on the " yajña " to seek in "jñana" the way of salvation; the other, heterodox and anti-vedic, of both Buddhism and Jainism, that sought liberation in a "jñana"-gnosis combined with an asceticism of detach- ment more or less radical and extreme. The retrograde evolution of the vedic sacrifice which provoked those spiritual revolutions had proceeded very gradually. Its egocentric process of often subconscious reasoning can be thus formulated : 1. The sacrifice honours the deity and propitiates it ; 2. Hence it appeals to it ; 3. Hence it gives it pleasure ; 4. Hence it is a boon to it - and, consequently, if it does not get it, it lacks something ; 5. Hence it needs it for its complete bliss ; 6. Hence it needs me who give it ; 7. Hence I can say : " do ut des "-I give that you shall give.-And here we are already in the open market-place, from merchant to merchant or customer to shop-keeper on a plane of equalit}7, and co-ordination instead of the religious subordination. From that attitude it is only a short step to the conclusion that the deity depends on my sacrifice, and that</page><page sequence="11">The Quest for the Original Rgveda ll the sacrifice is the source of my hold and power over it and also of all power for the deity's own self - it is the short step to full-blooded magic, a step-as we said-actually taken with surprising ease in the ritualistic Yajur-Veda and in the Brãhmanas - commentaries to all the Vedas including the Rgveda , as it is common knowledge. Those commentaries, all things considered, are practically manuals of ritualistic magic, where- as it has been often said - the religious means of the sacrifice becomes an end in itself, a semi-deified idol or better, an impersonal force, magical and atheistic - and this to such an extent that the philosophical school of the vedic ritual sacrifice ( " pùrva-mlmâmsâ " ) is officially atheistic - an extra-ordinary paradox indeed. A contributory cause to this state of affairs was the fact that the ritualistic-magic circles, with their folkloric and anthropomorphic tales about the gods and their feuds and manifold adventures, debased the figures of those deities to such a low level - as mere satellites of the sacrificial magic and even of the sacrificial expert - that there broke upon the vedic pantheon a veritable " twilight of the gods " a " Götter- dämmerung It was therefore not for nothing that the major and best portion of ancient Indian thought strove to divorce itself from such an aberrant distortion. The anti-magic reaction tended on the one hand, as already indicated, towards a rationalism more or less humanistic and ascetic or monistic ( in the Upanisads, Buddhism and Jainism) - and on the other hand towards a devotional and progressively depurated mono- theistic theism of diverse forms and sects which we see at a later stage burgeon forth in the two national epics, in particular the Mahãbhãrata - where we are brought face to face with the famous monotheistic poetic- religious-philosophical synthesis of the " Jßhagavad-gitäh upanisadah As for the deteriorated ritualism of the Brãhmana-type it remained bogged in the swamps of magic and made it possible that there should be upgraded to the rank of canonically accepted Veda a vedic work of ancient popular roots but of a rather belated redactorial com- position - the Aikarva-Veda, which, on the whole, is neither more nor less than a collection of black and white magic formulas, artificially attached to the now magically debased sacrificial ritual. 5. The " Linguistic Miracle" of the Rgveda But this very magic-bound tendency - in union with the impact (on orthodox-conservative circles ) of the anti-vedic-ritualistic currents, both those mentioned above and those whose critical attacks are recor- ded by Yãska - all this composite trend had also worked as a sort of catalytic agent in order to awaken and set in motion one of the most precious and characteristic gifts of the Indo-Aryan genius : an intense</page><page sequence="12">1Ž Annais of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research institute and vivid sense of the language and an extraordinary perspicacity in the analysis of its internal structure. The very tendency to bestow a magic value on the oral formulas employed in the sacrifice - a tendency combined with the other factors mentioned above - developed and per- fected this characteristic quality to such a degree that in the evolving process of time it made possible the advent of a veritable colossus of linguistic insight and grammatical analysis : Panini. He is not a fun- gus-growth or an isolated phenomenon, but rather stands out. like a towering Everest above a background of mountain ranges of predeces- sors that tentatively laid the basis for his masterly summit achievement. To that great master-mind we owe the complete and systematically integrated study of the Sanskrit language sometime about the V-IV century B. 0. In a sort of linguistic Algebra he laid down the foun- dations of our scientific knowledge, not only of that classical language, but also, to a large extent, of the Indo-European sister-languages, espe- cially Greek and Latin. For the comparative historical-philological study of those languages depends very substantially on Panini's work. And the latter ( even while superated by the later progress made with his initial help ) is and remains the golden link that binds together the speeches and cultures of India and Europe as members of the one origi- nal Indo-European family ; for it is through a Pãnini-pioneered philology that those members have found the golden bridge through which to re-live the close spiritual-cultural-linguistic relationship that had apparently been broken and lost right at the dawn of their wide- ranging history and expansion. It is therefore meet and just that we should render fitting tribute of admiration to the Indian genius in this scholarly- cultural domain. And to this same genius we also owe the predecessors of Panini who became the creator-authors of what we here term a " linguistic miracle namely the transmission of the Vedic literature, but especially of the Rgveda - through the conduct of a purely oral tradition, without manu- scripts, with an irreproachable and unparalleled fidelity for a period of about two thousand five hundred years - since, with Oldenberg, we consider the fixing of the present Samhitã-form to date from about the V-VI century B. C. We said oral tradition, for the texts we possess in writing either in rather late manuscripts or in printed form, are all mere echoes of that oral tradition which is still alive in the memory and the lips of the brahmanic specialist-reciters of our own India of today. The mnemotechnic power involved in it is in itself a marvel because of the extent of its contents since the Rgvecla alone consists of over a thousand hymns with about 10,000 stanzas and approximately 40,000 verses. But a greater marvel still is its fidelity, because that involves a more complicated technique of memorization : it is the technique of the most ingenious control-keys-the " päthas " or readings, thanks to which</page><page sequence="13">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 13 the text -against the above-mentioned natural wear and tear of language transmission-can be, and actually has been, preserved intact without danger of alteration. Those " pãthas " became variously diversified in the course of time, but the fundamental ones are : 1. The synthetic- continuous one ( " sam-hitã " ) that renders the orally un- broken text, as it is recited for ritual purposes and is learnt group- wise ; 2. The analytical or piece-meal ( " pada-pätha " ) rendered word by word, dissolving and restoring the phonetic sounds produced by the contact of words ( " liaison-samdhi " ) and the grammatical compounds or quasi-compounds ; 3. To this is added a comparative reading, in- volving a systematic and exhaustive scrutiny of all the differences that exist between the first and the second " pãthas "-and this is done in the works entitled " prãtiáãkhya. " These three " readings 55 would by themselves be sufficient to safeguard the text, but the brãhmanic virtu- osity added, as we said, others in the course of time.-They, all together, are known as " asta-vikrtayah " the eight varieties, which make that safeguard more secure ; all the more so if we take into account the fact that all the brãhmanical schools learn them in the same gramophone- like, oral-gregarious way and thereby control one another effectively. This is a genius-like invention for the preservation of the text and as such superior to the one of mere manuscript transmission as the latter was known and practised in the West before the introduction of the press. D.- THE TEXT-CRITICAL PROBLEM IN THE RGVEDA Yet - and here comes our main problem - does that astonishing fidelity give us the original form of the rgvedic hymns exactly as it came from the mind and the lips of the composing rsi-kavis ? Are these hymns their " ipsissima verba " ? 1. The Problem exists : its roots As I have already pointed out further up, the scientific philology and textual criticism in the West and their modern counterparts in India itself tell us with one common voice that this is so only up to a certain point and in the main substance, as regards the Rgveda , if considered right from the moment of its composition by the rsi-kavis. Further they tell us that this fidelity is practically flawless ( with very minor and minute reservations - of which Oldenberg speaks ) only as starting from the synthetic ( samhitã ) text, since the other control- pãthas and keys are depending on and are derived from that text and that text alone. But all modern scholars are unanimously agreed in admitting that this synthetic bamhitã-text is truly syn-thetic or com- posite, in this sense, that it is the product and outcome of more than one redactorial arrangement and re-arrangement. The latter are visibly</page><page sequence="14">14 Annate of the Bhandarlcar Oriental Research Institute inscribed in the resulting order ( mixed with old breaches of that same order), in the uniformity of arrangement (and again divergencies from its plan), in the systematic division of the ten marídalas or cycles of hymns in this ancient " Bible " of the rgvedic psalms. Those " mandalas " are perceptibly composed of at least three separate and on the whole not contemporaneous layers : 1. The most ancient layer is the nucleus-group of uniformly serialized "family" -mandalas (II-VII) attributed severally and as compact units to various rsis or rsi-families and schools ; 2. The bracketing and less uniformly composed mandalas 1 + VIII together with IX (the latter being a systematic appendix and soma-concerning extract from all the foregoing mandalas ) as a second major layer ; 3. The final and youngest layer , mandala X, forming a latter-day additional supple- ment of heterogeneous contents and, by and large, of a junior type of language and style. The whole series is not only internally in each mandala, but also in relation to one another, arranged with a coordinat- ing system which, in spite of occasional divergencies and alterations, succeeded in transforming the chaos of family rivalries and self-assert- ing traditions of the reciter-schools into a common, uniform and standard manual universally and, finally, solely accepted ( superseding the Bhãskala and other numerous schools ) by all the brãhmanic families and clans in the whole of India. That unification by itself is a historical-cultural event of the first magnitude, and we do not yet fully know what were the factors that made it possible in the face of the fissiparous tendencies and of the vested interests at work. Possibly, again, the anti-vedic cross-currents produced a common crisis which jolted the traditional reciter-families into making common cause under the leadership of some prestigious school, (like the " Kanvas " of books I and VIII ? ) and-or the patronage of some prosperous revivalist king But, whoever those redactors were, one thing will be generally admitted, namely that they were members of a brahman ical traditional school whose interests were both ritualistic and linguistic-grammatical, representing what was considered as best in the brahmanic literary and linguistic lore of their times. Yet those times were already very widely separated from the original rgvedic composition period. Whole centuries - as we said above - and many successive-transmitting reciter-generations separated them from the days when the rsi-kavis, especially the more archaic ones, had composed their poems. Following Oldenberg's lead we would not be lar wrong if we put the composition of the most ancient hymns that we now possess somewhere around or between the XIII and the X centuries B. C. straggling possibly towards the IX in their epi- gonic sequel. But- as we said above- the final settling of the Samhitã- text was, according to the same Oldenberg, somewhere in the VI- V century, not so very much before Pänims time, as the stage of the reda- ctorial phonetics and samdhi allows us to surmise.</page><page sequence="15">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 15 Now, it is at this point that the great question arises in all its seriousness ; what had happened in the intervening gap of time, when the traditional oral transmission was more family-wise and above all, without the control-pãthas and without the universal methodical counter-checking resulting from common uniform mnemonic recitation of all the hymns by all the schools ? " There was sure to be much partial wearing and tearing of the text, as we have already said and is the normal trend of all oral transmission. But one thing is certain, that the very fact of the fixing of the text and of its control-keys involves a vivid consciousness of the danger of decay that was apprehended by the Sarhhitã-Kãra agency, and the very extreme of the care taken surely shows that the danger was felt as a very real one and therefore as born from a direct and practical experience of its deleterious effects upon the actual texts. The above- mentioned strictures recorded by Yäska would point in the same direction. Another fundamental feature will throw light on the same problem. The very way in which the Samhitã-Kãra agency handled the collected texts shows that the general attitude was one of partially but constantly adapting and modifying the texts, in function of the changes undergone by the literary language-standards of the successive generations of transmitters. For, if there is any fact, as was also point- ed out, about which all modern scholars are agreed it is this one that the SK redactors applied to the archaic traditional text a set of rules on phonetics, samdhi and ( partly also ) grammatical formations of a period much posterior to the one of their actual composition. That is to say that they consciously and systematically adapted the text to the standards which in their own contemporary time were held as hiera- tically and classically correct. And, in so doing, they went so far that for the sake of their new-fangled correctness-they ruthlessly sacrificed to their own "modern" fashionable " ista-devatãs " ( " áiksã " and vy äk arana " ) the pet child of every self-respecting poet, " chandas the archaic metre and rhythm of the rsi-kavis - on the woefully misapplied plea that, forsooth, correctness goes before musicality ! And it is precisely here that they left an indelible thumb-mark impression on their constituted text, thanks to which we, the modern text-critical detectives, would be able to follow the trail of their inno- vations, crack their redactorial code, and with growing certainty un- mask their well-meant but disfiguring " improvements The reason is that the latter manifestly distorted, in a more or less substantial way, the versified rhythm , and lamed and maimed the verses and, with them, figuratively, their innocent authors, in a most incredible fashion - incre- dible considering the care and pattern- true perfection with which the Surrounding verses had been composed by the very same authors,</page><page sequence="16">16 Annate of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 8. The basis for a working Hypothesis And here you have both the point of departure of our investigation and reconstruction and also the main line of approach of its rationally systematic method : 1 . Induction on a large scale shows the main common patterns of the various rgvedic metres - and they are all the more easy to trace since those metres have their continuing counter- parts in the subsequent literature; 2. Another inductive study con- firms what already all modern scholars have unanimously accepted - namely, that innumerable times the flaws in that pattern are not due to the Icavis but to the Samhitã-Kãras' redactorial intrusion with their younger phonetic, samdhi and grammatical system redactorially superimposed ( palimpsested ! ) upon the rsi-kavis' archaic text. 3. And here comes the more specially original part of our method : therefore the SK ( let us name that agency in the collective singular for convenience ) breaks and jettisons the Icavis own standard verse-patterns for the sake of his own principles and prejudices-consequently it is logical to con- clude that ivhenever the standard patterns are broken it will also be due to the same redactorial agency and not to the rsi-kavis - consequent- ly, again, if mere phonetics, pronunciation, samdhi and the restitution of archaic forms are not sufficient to restore the standard pattern, it must be due to the fact that the SK must, have made use of other redactorial devices - the most obvious and likely being, naturally» a change in the order of words ; for, on the one hand, it is utterly im- plausible that the kavi, whom we find systematically working accord- ing to a pattern, should fail to do so when he has in the same line all the elements that can build that same pattern - and, on the other hand, we already know that the pattern is secondary for the SK, that he positively subordinates it to his samdhi, phonetics and pronunciation, and that he is therefore likely to alter the order of the words for a suffi- ciently redactorial reason, like clarity, avoidance of worse verse-destru- ction through his new samdhi and such-like. 3. The working Hypothesis Hence the fundamental working hypothesis for a text-critical reconstruction of the Rgveda is bound to be the following : metre and archaism ( together with the testimony of parallel rgvedic texts ) are paramount against the SK's text as it lies ( hence against the SK's in- novation and grammar vs. metre )-and, consequently, any modification of the text - especially in the word-order -which is necessary to restore the standard. ' metre-pattern ( in function of archaism and parallelism ) must be deemed as restoring the original text of the rsi-kavis. E. - TPIE NEW FOCUSSING OF THE PROBLEM The problem is, therefore, essentially one of metrics, prosody and archaism ? Were the rsi-kavis or were they not, perfect in adhering to a versifying system which was fixed and definite in its general types</page><page sequence="17">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 17 and in its details ( within the frame of certain accepted but not arbi- trary variations in those details ) ? Or was theirs only a vague and wavering approximation which admitted of divergencies even in their essential elements ? Were theirs just mere more or less primitive attempts at versification which reached only as far as they could go when they could not obtain metrical perfection ? 1 . Foryfier Opinion discarded This is what many rgvedic scholars have long been opining, so much so that this opinion has almost attained the category of a dogma in many manuals of Indology. And this is so because it seems to be an established fact, as a consequence of studies as systematic - though diverging in many important points - as those of an Oldenberg ( in his " Prolegomena " and " Noten " ) and of an Arnold ( in his " V edic Metre " ). For Oldenberg, above all, I cherish a reverence and esteem of a real disciple, even though I was one only through his books ; but even with regard to him I am bound to profess : 11 Amicus Plato, sed magis amica ventas". Oldenberg, like Plato, is my friendand master - but a greater friend and master is truth. For " satyam eva jayate My system and method is rooted in Oldenberg, but it does not hesitate, when truth demands it, to go beyond him and even at times against him-as I feel sure he would have me do, if he were alive today. Neither Oldenberg nor Arnold lack talent, logic, systematic method nor profound and detailed knowledge of the Rgveda. Indeed, given the basis on which they build, it would be difficult to do, within the limitations of human fallibility, a better or more conscientious scholarly work. But that basis is, substantially at least, that the Samhitä-text, as it is, represents the work of the rsi-kavis practically in everything but in the application of the laws of archaic pronunciation and phonetic combination or samdhi. But that is precisely what my long-drawn investigations, based on the above considerations, have forced me to doubt first and finally to reject. For the traditional Samhitä-text represents the modified text of the editor-redactors ( in and even before the Šakala-šakha ) not only in the pronunciation and samdhi, but also in the following main points : 1. In the word-order , mostly within the pad a but also between padas, 2. In the substitution of " modern " or more acceptable forms and words for archaic ones ( like " pavãka, tubhya, pra^/uga " given as " pãvaka, tubhyarâ, prai&amp;ga etc. ) ; 3. In the addition of fillers consist- ing both of particles and of other words or phrases ; 4. In the omission ( besides the losses through haplology ) of certain words, both obsolete and otherwise, in the course of oral transmission or by wilful redaction. In most of the cases the changes do not affect the substantial meaning - 3 [ Annals, B. O. R. I. ]</page><page sequence="18">18 Annate of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute as if the redactorial agency, at Jeast in some oř its stages, had, as in the case of samdhi, been more concerned - very understandably - with pre- serving the " artha " than the literal áabda The result is therefore, as already indicated above, that the Samhitã text is not the original Rgveda of the rsi-kavis but something of a " palimpsest", under whose ])resent surface-layer the original form can, to our great satisfaction, still be uncovered and restored to its pristine form. The Reason of the Unreason ( of the " Palimpsest " ) But how to explain fully this palimpsesting process ? The answer is that the SK agency saw itself compelled by the logic of their position and the force of facts to create that " palimpsest" - largely in a desire of preservation and out of respect for the prestige of the text. For, on the one hand, they were the transmitters of a traditional versi- fied text, indeed versified in precisely the ( substantially ) very same metrical patterns with which they were familiar in their own times ; and yet the verbal content, the words of those archaic texts, had greatly changed, partly in meaning and usage, partly in their pronunciation, and especially in their samdhi - so much so that many verses, as we said above, were no real verses any more. For it is absolutely clear from the Samhitã text itself that the archaic freedom in the use of samdhi ( or even partly the positive lack of it ) had completely disappeared in the SK's times. As a consequence the SK, in order to preserve the prestige of his text as a poetic-versified work, would naturally tend to do all he could, through changes of order and other means, so that the verse should not be destroyed. And he had to do that because his own standardized and iron-clad grammatical rules did not allow him to make any exceptions from the established code. A rsi-kavi could, and often did say something like : (t indrasya agnaih " without praálista, when he wanted five syllables for his verse and rhythm; but the SK would unavoidably have to pronounce : u indrasyãgnaih " with four syllables and a ruined verse, or - and that was his saving remedy - reshuffle the words into " agner-indrasya ". - No wonder he often opted for some such " minor evil " ! 8. The working Hypothesis " works " And that is what led to the formulation of our working hypo- thesis : wherever and whenever there is a metrical flaw there must be some grammatical or stylistic reason of the later redactorial time which has forced or misled the hand of the SK in order to avoid what in his opinion was a " major " evil. Hence in all such cases we have but to re- constitute the metre and rhythm in function of the archaic trends of phonetic-prosodic pronunciation and samdhi and we shall find that thç</page><page sequence="19">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 19 SK had to make those changes in order to salvage what was still salvageable, in accordance with his grammatical and stylistic preconceptions. Now since a posteriori, an ever-growing accumulation of facts came to confirm that hypothesis, we were able to establish a gradation of subsidiarity among the SK's redactorial principles ( what we might with Shakespeare jocularly call his " method in madness " ) : 1. First and foremost stands the " ista-devatã " : Grammar inali its aspects (the SK's own grammar ; well understood - as against the rsi-kavi's obsolete- archaic or ťí arsa " one ! ) If this demands the wrecking of the verse, even that sacrifice will have to be made. But before that comes to pass all available means must be employed to avoid it - so as to save the rsi- kavi's face as a poet - provided the essential sense remains unimpaired. 2. If then the verse has to suffer, the most essential versifying factors have to be salvaged in descending order : first the number of syllables ; second, and practically on a level with the former, the final characteristic rhythm; third , in the tristubli-jagatï metre the " yati " or caesura • fourth in the same metre, the post-yati rhythm; fifth and last, the initial rhythm. It is not necessary to stress that the subsidiarity of those factors will naturally be exposed to multiple interferences in cases of conflict. 3. If the verses are deficient in syllables ( owing to changes from the archaic prosodical pronunciation) particles of the expletive-emphatic type ( " pürana " ) may be added unless the neighbouring similar verses show like deficiencies, for, in that case, they may remain as " arsa " peculiarities of the archaic rsi-kavis. 4. Since the rsi-kavis use so many archaic grammatical peculiarities ( which are still accepted and preserved as such by the SK ), he feels en- titled to make use of them in other more or less similar cases, following the principle of analogy. Very frequently that analogy is erroneously applied, but the SK gets his object of saving the verse at least apparent- ly and in the most essential features at the expense of " minor evils Besides, the parallel-texts render his redactorial retouches more plausible and acceptable to the traditional-transmitting milieu. This principle of pseudo-analogy was acutely observed and formulated by Oldernberg in his Prolegomena. But the SK was almost naturally led into that path by the striking fact that the rsi-kavis show such a pro- fusion of variations of similar turns and phrases, as if they were ready- made for substitution according to the needs of different metrical situa- tions. Not only that, but a look at major reference works ( like Bloom- field's, Concordance ? and Rgveda Repetitions and Bloomfield-Edgerton's Vedic Variants ), will show how free are different Samhitãs and</page><page sequence="20">20 Annals of the Bhandarlcar Oriental Research Institute Brähmaiias in variating and adapting one simple original text when quoting it or adopting it into a similar or even different context The V edic Samhitã-Kãras are a freely editing tribe. But even the kavis themselves have already set the example - though they are always versifying poets first, not pedantic grammatical pandits, like our SK proves to be. h. The cracking of the SK's redactorial Code Summing up, we can say that the systematic rationale of our SK was : complete subordination of verse and rhythm to the grammatic- 8tylistic " modernisation " or updating of the archaic rgvedic language orientated towards a standard-level which was considered as the ideal of a sacral, traditional archaic-classical speech in the concept of the SK, and of the áista-circles amongst whom he moved. But that ideal language - in response probably to anti-vedic criticisms - could not, he clearly thought, be allowed to appear excessively archaic, outmoded or even solecistic, especially if it went counter to the rules of pronunciation and grammar considered as standard by the SK and his áista-con- temporaries - a standard that is close to Panini's own but partly different from and senior to it. It is therefore only logical that the reconstruction of the original text underlying that " palimpsest " should have as its guiding syste- matic " rationale " the diametrically opposed one , which is the one propounded as a result of our investigations - namely: subordination of that redactorial grammatical-textual modernisation to the demands of rhythm by means of a conscientious application of the archaic tenden- cies revealed by the text in function of that very rhythm . Now, we are able to discover those archaic tendencies precisely because of the peculiar midway position represented by the SK's funda- mental attitude. The SK, as a redactorial agency, was partly conservative at the same time as partly innovating. He was not simply a freewheel- ing iconoclast and revolutionary, but on the contrary he lived in a tradi- tional-conservative atmosphere, so typical of the Indo- Aryan culture as a constant feature of its cultural evolution - and that characteristic would not have allowed him to manhandle the traditional-much less the sacred- texts according to his own untramelled caprice, but only to modify them in what was authoritatively deemed to be an amelioration and enhancing embellishment in style and grammar - yet always on the basis of the traditional, as far as possible. This is, as we can easily see, a reflection of what happened to the two national epics - but within the narrower margin imposed by the sacred ritualistic character of the rgvedic texts. And it is due to that half- way-house position of the SK ( as set against</page><page sequence="21">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 21 the background and countercheck of his total cultural milieu ) that we owe the preservation of so many archaic features of the primitive text - and those are the ones that allow us to be optimistic about our text- critical quest after the original Rgveda of the rsi-kavis. 5. The Nature and Value of the SK's work Hence, in spite of our ruthless and systematic criticism of the SK agency, what an immense debt of gratitude and admiration we owe to it for the still surprising intelligence and linguistic knowledge demons- trated in so considerably preserving and so securely fixing the text in such an ancient stage-gratitude and admiration also for the relative moderation with which they adhered to that " via media " between tradi- tion and the urge for reform anticipatingly pulling Pänini-wards ! It is bound to strike a sympathetic chord in the heart of every sensitively cultured man to see those vedic specialists of ages so remote striving, with their moderate retouchings of their traditional religious hymns to preserve for them, the values of a polished and intelligible style and language, the value of a rationally human dialogue with the super-human deities of their traditional pantheon. The figures of those rgvedic editors, in spite of their deficiencies, stand out, against the nebulous and ego-centric back-drop of the ritualistic magic, ( for whom the " mantra " is a mere manipulating " yantra " ), as representatives of an aspiration after a personal and conscious dialogue with the divinity. Surely their labour and tendency must have contributed to maintain alive the flame of that theo-centric and theistic yearning which we later on find alive in the Mahãbhãrata and see palpitating in the multiple manifestations of Visnuism, iŠivaism and other religious move- ments. Compared with the literary-redactorial transmitting of the other three Vedas, the master-builders of the Rgvedic tradition make the impression of towering giants, not only in the religious-cultural aspect but also in the linguistic-literary one. Hence any new light thrown on the genesis and evolution of the Rgveda is bound to be a new clarification of the deepest roots of the Indian Hindu culture, of its human and humanistic values as well as of its spiritual affinity to the origins of the other branches which once sprang from the luxuriant Indo-European tree, especially the Western Greek and Latin sisters and mother-cultures. II. A SUMMARY-DEMONSTRATION OF THE METHOD But our courteous and sincere acknowledgements should not prevent us from facing the facts - and since our national motto is " satyam eva jayate " let us see how in practice the well-intentioned literary surgery of our brahmanic experts, operated upon the rgvedic texts and how it</page><page sequence="22">Éâ Annals of the Bhanďarkar Oriental Ěesearch Institute contrived to leave them often so impaired and disfigured- as contrasted with what we firmly believe was its pristine form and beauty before that surgical edito'rial-intervention. It is but natural and justified, nay necessary and logical, that here it should be felt that the above propounded theory demands a complete and convincing scientific demonstration and proof. It is evident though, that this is not feasible in a single address or essay. I have been doing it in a good many monographs, some already published, some in the process of publication or preparation. But what I aim at here is to give a clear idea of the method and a small but representative sample of its working and application. We have said above that the basic fact for our text-critical approach is the one generally admitted by rgvedic scholars: namely, that our Samhitã text is a redactorial product or palimpsest, in as far at least as its phonetic presentation and pronunciation as well as its samdhi are concerned. This affects and wrecks the original metre to a very large extent. From this we drew the starting point of our text-critical working hypothesis; and we formulated the latter as standing on the fundamen- tal principle that metre and archaism , especially in phonetics, prosody, pronunciation and samdhi, must be considered as paramount over and against the SK's Samhitã-palimpsest. We deduced from this (and other reasons) a vary important and far-reaching consequence : namely that the SK had used the redactorial device of word-transposition or word mobility , which we were entitled to restore to its original archaicising order. We can say that, on the whole, our text-critical approach is that of Oldenberg in his " Prolegomena but we go beyond him in this principle of " word-mobility " and in some other points which we shall point out further down. A. - The chief rgvedic metres : paradigms Now of the two main props of our method the first one is metre . We all know that the Rgveda is prosodically metrical ( like Greek and Latin ), hence based both on the number of syllables and on their proso- dical quality and also on their rhythm or combination especially in the verse-or pãda-end. The bulk of the Rgveda is composed in three chief metres : the 8-syllable " anustubh-gãyatrl ", the 11-syllable " triritubh " and the It-syllable "jagatl". The stanzas have mostly four or three lines or padas.</page><page sequence="23">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 23 The 8-syllabic metre is predominantly iambic-ending ; but it can also be trochaic-ending ( these two are the older rgvedic types ) : " agnim ïdai purohitam ( i ) " tat savitur varainiyam ( i ) or " samrãjantam adhvarãnãm ( tr. ) The metrical scheme is : &lt; 7 . V V v V V iambic: 7 - - - - ^ ^ V = g trochaic : - - - - , ~ ^ ~ - , = 8 The only rule, outside the final rhythm, is that either the second or the third syllable uses to be prosodically long or protracted. ( N, B. The younger anustubh in the later rgvedic layers follows quasi-epic trends ). The tristubh and jagatï metres are non-identical twins in their general scheme. But the first is trochaic-ending, the second iambic - ending, with a "yati" (caesura) after the fourth or fifth syllable. Thus : Early yati: Tristubh : ^ ~ ^ ^ ^ = 11 Jagatï: - - ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ = 12 Late yati : Tristubh : ^ ^ = H Jagatï : =12 v v ; The pre-y&amp;bi rhythm is in both cases predominantly iambic, and the post-y ati one must contain at least one short syllable, especially with the early yati. The pre-yati one is more variable. This is the standard pattern and the rsi-kavis invariably observe it. Any default is equally invariably to be attributed to the SK and to be remedied by means of archaism and-or reshuffle. This goes beyond Oldenberg and partly against him, since he actually attributed to the rsi-kavis the anomalous verses, especially the hypometric and hyper- metric ones, while a thorough study has convinced us that they are and çan only be the SK's owq,</page><page sequence="24">24 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute B. - Archaism : its features This much for the metre. Examples will follow further down. But before that let us give a summary explanation of what we mean by archaism in this context. The first feature of that archaism is the freedom in the use of Samdhi : there is no samdhi over the yati; much less between padas ( against the SK ! ). Within the päda all samdhis are at most optional, subject to the metre and rhythm, and, as a general rule, there is no such thing as " abhinihita " or " ksaipra " between words for the rsi-kavis - only for the SK ! The second archaic feature is protraction : the rsi-kavis consider as long ( protracted ) a short syllable that falls within the range of the final rhythm (syllables 5-8 in the octosyllabic, and 8-11, 8-12 in the other two metres ) and probably also in the pre-y ati one, especially in a " brevis inter breves, " a final word-vowel ( particularly if first member of a compound ) and a final word -syllable. This completely baffled the SK and is also partly beyond and against Oldenberg, though partly backed by Arnold. Its ultimate root lies probably in an archaic " pro- traction-law " especially investigated by Wackernagel in his " Dehnun- gsgesetz " ( cfr. his Altindische Grammatik , I, p. LXXVIII ); but the rsi-kavis generalized it far more as a metrical convention. The third archaic feature is : all long vowels and all diphthongs are on principle subject to resolution ( into two component elements ), if and when so demanded by the metrical rhythm, and the resulting short vowels are themselves subject to a further protraction under the same conditions as ordinary short vowels, since they are distinct elements for the kavi's own orthoepy ( correct prosodical pronunciation ). The fourth archaic feature is : we must render the text with the actual pronunciation given to it by the rsi-kavis, hence all diphthongs should be rendered as double sounds and as respectively short or long: e = ai , o = au; ai = ãi; au = ãu. Further, resolved vowels should be duplicated : ã = aa&gt; % - iit û = uu. Also " ksaipras " should be dissolved together with the false " prašlistas " and " abhinihitas Pro- tracted vowels should be indicated either by a combination of the con- ventional signs for short or long syllables ( &lt;?, /, ü ) or otherwise ( ä, ï, ü ). The above restorations will give us a text faithful to its original form and very close to the state in which we find the Avesta sister-text, especially with regard to the diphthongs. C.~ An Objection - its Answer And now before we pass to the actual sample-test of our text- critical restoration, let us answer again more explicitly a possible stan- dard objection : namely, the method here is based on a fundamental reliance on the metrical pattern-true fidelity of the rsi-kavis to their</page><page sequence="25">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 25 standard verse-schemes. In fact we assert that it is a priori implausi- ble, from the mere statistical point of view, to accept that the same kavis who can be shown to be so consistently and meticulously careful about the essential elements of their verses should have, at random intervals, been guilty of such obvious and ear-rending inconsistencies, when at the same time they are found so universally sensitive to that prosodical value. - Especially when they composed exclusively for the ear (" šruti ") and mostly, if not always, as we have already said, in open and jealously contested competition with fellow-professionals and rivals whose standards of prosodical versification were as high as mere statistic indications already force us to conclude. Or else how to explain that overwhelming consistent correctness in the rest of the text, especially after the few more general phonetic misrepresentations are discarded. It is true that someone may think of taking refuge behind the well-known tag " aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus"; but precisely in the case of the Homeric works (rather close in nature and characteris- tics to the Rgveda compositions ) an eminent scholar, my late-lamented teacher in the Berlin University, Prof. Dr. W. Schulze, made a uame for himself by proving, in his brilliant " Quaestiones Epicae ", that in reality the ones to be caught napping were not the Homeric rhapsodes but the error and ignorance of those scholars who were so lightly ready to lay the blame at the old poeťs own door when the fault lay wih the later Alexandrian redactors who had misled the subsequent scholarly world into overlooking the primitive-ancient metre and archaism that was underlying their palimpsested rendering of the original ancient text. Exactly the same was the fate of the Rgveda at the hands of the Samhitã-Kãra and his áãkala-áãkhã. Truly, there is nothing new under the sun-and we are in good company indeed, even if the spirit of this Institute and of its work on the Mahãbhãrata were not there to reassure us that we are on the right path back to the original Rgveda of the deft master-craftsmen of versification that were the rsi-kavis. No, the latter must be held innocent , unless and until proven guilty - while the SK, by the mere fact of his mishandling of the Samhitã pho- netics and samdhi, must logically always be held guilty of redactorial meddling unless and until proven innocent of blame . D. - The octosyllabic gâyatrï-anustubh : samples Now for the sample-test. And first in the 8-syllable verses .* The first hymn of the Rgveda is a good specimen of the iambic rhythm. * N. B. - In transcribing texts we use X for word-transpositions ; 4- for vowel-samdhi between words ; italics for emendation of the SK's text. The rest as already indicated further up for vowels and diphthongs. 4 [ Annals, B. O.

Not a flaw, and no possible doubt that the kavi intends and easily gets his iambic end-rhythm. How easily, will appear at once.

Now everybody admits that all the verses are octosyllabic - though in as many as six cases we have to go against the phonetic presentation of our Samhitã -palimpsest and restore the archaic one of the kavis ( 2c: îdyo=îdiyo; 6a: tvam = ti¿vam 8c: svai = swvai ; 9c: svastayai = suva- stayai; 9b, gnai=agnai ( no abhinihita ! ); and also : 8a ) rãjantam adhvarãnaam = 8. This is another case of modernising redaction which must be restored to its archaic form by means of a resolution of a long vowel into two short ones ( -nam into naam ). And here we see also how free the kavis were in the use of their archaisms as required for their prevalent rhythm, for another kavi - as we have seen above - uses almost the same phrase to get a trochaic rhythm (without any resolution ) in a trochaic context: I, 27, lc ) samrãjantam adhvarãnãm = 8. Our conclusion can only be that when a kavi is consistently using a rhythm - as is the case in our first hymn - we are bound to admit that any such apparent exception leads us to an archaic rule of orthoepic pronunciation - after we have eliminated any possibility of redactorial alteration. Now then, the second stanza ( in I, 1 ) begins: 2a ) agnaih pûrvaibhih rsibhih. Four short syllables at the end, with no rhythm whatsoever, and no possibility of getting the iambic one. Therefore we are bound to con- clude to an archaic orthoepic pronunciation with a rhythmical protrac- tion of the r in " rsibhih " - a " brevis inter breves For it would be utterly implausible that a kavi who, as we have seen, has composed %G out of 27 pädas in perfect and consistent iambic rhythm ( making use of various archaisms in the process ) should com- mit such a false step in one single isolated verse. And that not in an impromptu composition but in a competition-poem meant for public recitation before experts by a poet who has in this very poem proved</page><page sequence="27">Ťhe Quest for the Original Rgveda 27 himself a versifier of such ability and so many linguistic resources. And, since such cases are often repeated under similar conditions, the rule of rhythmical protraction of a " brevis inter breves " has to be accepted as an archaic versifying convention of the rgvedic rsi-kavis, as Arnold rightly contends and Oldenberg himself practically also admits, even though with some relatively minor reservation. Even the SK has kept some traditional cases with special features, like " árudhí havam, bharä twvam ", which are precious remnants of a much more widely applied archaic orthoepic rule. With this experience we can now see our way to remedjnng other palimpsesting intrusions by the SK. But how wary our work must be is shown by the next example. The third hymn of the Samhitã is a mainly iambic one, especially in the last trca ; but all of a sudden we find : I, 3, lia ) caudayitri súnrtãnãm. This is purely trochaic. But the next line, together with the two surrounding iambic trcas, seems to show what the kavi intends: lib ) caitantx sumatlnaam ( iambic ) : Hence the kavi - we could think - must have said : " caudïtrl sùnrtânaam " ( iambic ) : This is strengthened by the fact that the form of the causative ( " cau- dayitri " ) is a very exceptional one in the Rgveda ( cfr. Wackernagel, III, para. 501 ) and that its masculine counterpart is always "cauditr" ( not " caudayitr " ), occurring no less than 7 times ( cfr. Grassmann ) - while " caudayitri" occurs only here and in one single other text: VII, 81, 6c ) caudayitri maghaunah sünrtävatl - cauditrii maghaunah „ (?) The initial rhythm looks odd and non-iambic, only comparable to another single oddity among the hymn's nine jagatls, of which seven follow the standard pattern : 3c ) yä vahasi puru spärliam vananvati ( ! ? ) = puru spärham yä vahase ,, „ Here it is obvious enough that the SK is dodging the ( for him ! ) im- possible protraction of the " brevis inter breves " in vahas$ + vananvati". As for the kavi's style in the placing of the relative " yä " cfr. 4a, ( cfr. also IV, 20,9c; I, 142, lObc; VI, 29, 6d for the placing of "puru"); and besides note that ( in the same VII, 81 ) the SK is dodging another " brevis inter breves " and his samdhi - to " save " the verse - in: la ) pratyu ( ! ) adaráy 4 äyatl = prati adarái äyatl ( no ksaipras ! - no " pùrana u " ! ).</page><page sequence="28">28 Annals of the Bhandarlcar Oriental Research Institute Hence there seems to be no doubt that the SK is palimpsesting in 6c above with his " codaj/itrï " so as to " save " that verse too, since he cannot make the pada complete by the kavi's own possible archaic resolution " cauditrii " ! - And now would come the same SK's hand that transformed " pavãka " into " pãvaka " everywhere for uniformity's sake - and, since there is a single parallel occurrence of c&lt; cauditri " in our I, 3, 11a, he correspondingly and confirmingly would have unifor- mised it into " cauda j/itri all the more since for him that "àrsa" päda has only 7 syllables, and therefore lacks one ! And thus the form that seems demanded by so many convergent indicia : " cauditrï sünrta- naam " would be palimpsested away into: " caudaj/itrï súnrtãnãm The SK could be encouraged to that by the above pmtcčo-analogy, and because in I, 3, 4-6 the kavi has introduced a mixed-rhythm trca, ( yet according to a consistent pattern , not at random ! ) : 4a) indra + ã yãhi citrabhãnau ( tr .!) cfr. 6a ! = troch. ! = ã yãhi + indra „ „ (?) b ) sutãh imai twvãyavah ( i. ) = i. c )= anvxbhih tanä pûtâsah ( ! ? ) = ... pütaas tanã (i.)

B. ) j = i. c ) sutai dadhisva naá cana ( i. ) [ = i. But this very same consistent pattern : 4 ( tr. + i. + i. ) + 5 ( i. + i. + i. ) + 6 ( tr. + i. + i. ) makes us realize that the kavi has an overall pattern : 1st. trca : iambic ; Snd. trca: mixed ( with the first pãdas alternatively : tr-i.-tr. ; 3rd . trca : iambic ( again ! ); 4th. trca: mixed ( again !-with the first pãdas alternating inversely : i.-tr.-i. ) Hence I, 3, 10-12 are : 10 ( i. + i. + i. ) + 11( tr.-i.-i. ) + 12 ( i. + i. + i. ). But this reverses the whole procesé of reasoning above ( as far as the form " caudaj/itri " itself is concerned ): for now there is no metrical need to change " cauda^/itrl súnrtãnãm since it fits into the rsi kavi's scheme, and into the metrical trochaic frame of I, 3, 11a. On the other</page><page sequence="29">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 29 hand we can see that this causative form, though extremely rare in the Rgveda , is backed by one more occurrence in 1, 161, 13: c ) " svãnam bastah baudhayitãram abravlt Hence the respect for the extant traditional text, together with the fact that our chief text-critical instrument ( of metre and archaism ) does not really apply in this case, forces us to admit the genuineness of : I, 3, 11a ) caudayitri súnrtãnãm ( troch. ! ) We have worked out this case in full to show how some of our provisional solutions are improved and made definitive in the light of further discoveries about the kavi's archaic orthoepy. We had formerly published the answer based on a plausible-looking " cauditrx " emenda- tion. We take this opportunity to make public its correction in the sense expressed above. At the same time we have gained a new insight into the kavi's skill in metrical combinations and archaic orthoepy palimpsested away by the SK's text. Another case - in I, 4 : 8b ) ghanah vrtrãnãm abhavah ( ! ? ) ( rhythm ! ) = ghanah vrtr asya cbhavab. The SK is visibly dodging his samdhi by coolly changing the natural- contextual singular into a plural : 8a ) asya pxtvã áatakratau ( context ! ) b ) ghanah vrtr asya dbhavali. The same applies to the parallel texts and context ( uniformised by the SKI): VIII, 96, 18a ) tevam ha tyat vrsabha carsanlnãm b ) ghanah vrtrãnãm tavisah babhütha ( ! ? ) = „ vrtr asya c ) tt&amp;vam sindhùn asrjas tastabhãnãn ( N.

B. ! -in a different context and sense of " ghana " ! ) one kavi has used that plural once - and that pseudo-analogy is enough for him. The text concerned is a very out- standing example of the SK's palimpsesting technique. It is ill Y I, 26: 8a ) vayam tay asyãm indra dyumnahùtâu ( ! ? ) = asyãm indra dyumnahútã vayam tai ( cfr. b ! ) ( ? ) == vayam asyãm indra tai dyumnahùtâu „ ( ? ) = asyãm tay indra vayam „ „ „</page><page sequence="30">ãO Annals of the Bhandúrkar Oriental Research Institute b ) sakhãyah syãma mahina pra-isthãh ( N.

Note also the archaic dative " ghan ãi" ( cfr. " sanayai " ! ) changed by the SK into locative vs. his unmetrical ãya dative ( modern ! ) - and cfr. V, 60, 4c ; VI, 41, 4b. At other times the SK interpolates a filler-word because of his samdhi, as in the same VI, 26 ( above ) : 2c ) tvam vrtraisv + indra satpatim tarutram ( ! ? ) = twvam vrtraisu satpatim tarutram ( no " indra " ! ) Note the ( for the kavi ) impossible ksaipras ! Also the plural "vrtresw". in a context similar to 8a above ! Another typical sample of the SK's meddling is in I, 4 ( with a faked " abhinihita " which wrecks the päda ) : 10a ) yo rãyo 'vanih mahãn ( SK"s " special ", noted by Oldenberg ! ) = yah rãyah a vanih " ( cf. VIII, 32, 13a ). Further, with reshuffle, svarabhakti and archaic double-samdhi ( in a perfectly metrical and iambic 40-päda hymn ! ) ; I, 6, 10c ) indram mahah vã rajasah = mahah vã rajasa(h) + indaram ( double-samdhi ! )- cf. ab ! Here we have also the usual protraction of a " brevis inter breves " and a non- ksaipra in : la ) yuñjanti bradhnam crusam 8c ) ganäih indrasya kãmiyãih. Further a long-vowel resolution combined with a protraction " inter breves " : 8a ) ãt aha svadhâJm anu or : = aã t aha svadhäm Finally, an SK's uniformisation ayainst the rhythm ( starting from 1, 127, 3c, below ) : 5a ) vidu cit ärujatnubhih = vidu cit „ „ ( plural-or protraction ? )</page><page sequence="31">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 31 cfr.

Here note the reciters' haplology in I, 71, 2a (beginning with "drdh&lt;?(m) + pi - : drdhã + pi-" as against the phonetically protected " drdhã sa-" in VIII, 40, lc ), and the clear singular " vidu " in I, 127, 3c together with the usual protraction " inter breves " in " yasya saimrtau". I could go on for ever. But the above examples should suffice; They are mainly drawn from the first ten hymns of the Samhitã, pick- ing out ( among the 8-syllable verses ) the more clear and striking cases that can demonstrate most of the archaisms buried in our " Palimpsest" by the SK's redactorial method. But our text-critical approach had to range over the whole Rgveda in order to show that it is a uniform- methodical solution for the text as a ivhole. And this is only a small sample, for there are others far more important and of far-reaching value for the reconstruction of the original Rgveda of the rsi-kavis. But " ex ungue leonem " - from this specimen one can already glimpse what kind of a radical redactorial surgeon that SK was who brought his scalpel to bear on the archaic hymns of the ancient rgvedic bards. Scarcely anything escapes his operating touch. Even the beautiful and tradition-hallowed Sãvitri bears the marks of his handling before it was incorporated into the upanayana ritual : III, 62, 10a ) tat savituh varenyam = tat savztuh varaimyam b ) bhargah daivasya dhlmahi c ) dhiyah yo nah pracodayät ( ! ? ) = dhiyah yat nah pracaudayãt. The rhythm suggests "savour" in 10a, and actually we find the word " prasavltã " in IV, 53, 6a ; VII, 63, 2a in a faultless metrical position ; but the Pp. shows the trend in the SK's mind by reducing it to the usual " prasavltã " - and that is what the SK likely did in our text because of the rather extreme rarity and obsoleteness of the alternative form ( which is supported by " savïman, pratarîtr, amarïtr " ) in a pro- fusely used noun. Cfr. : V, 82, la ) tat savituh vrinmahai I, 159, 5a ) tat rädhah asya savituh varainïyam b ) vayarh daivasya prasavai manãmahai</page><page sequence="32">32 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute c ) asmabhyarh dyãvã-prthivi sucaitunä d ) rayim dhattam vasumantam šatagvinam. This stanza's pãda-order must be inverted into cdab , as the remote and immediate context ( " tat rãdhah " vs. " rayim " in 5c ) and the syntax demand-cfr. VII, 82, 10. ( The SK has pseudo-imitated III, 38, 7 + 8a). For the same pronunciation speaks another päda of the last stanza in this iambic trca ( III, 62, 10-12 ) : 12a ) daivam narah savitäram ( ! ? ) ( euphonic reshuffle ! ) = narah daivam s&amp;v%taar- ( iambic, like the whole trca and 4-18 ). This is an archaic " clipped termination " of the well-known type " navyasã vacas-" ( for " vacasã " ) and " citräbhih üt¿-" ( for " ûti bhih" ) which the SK has at times kept, at times misunderstood and miscorre- cted ( as in "tanwvã su varcali" - X,14,8d - for the original "suvarcas-" instead of " suvarcasã " ( ? ) or in " daivãn " for the archaic genit. pl. " daivãm", as if it were clipped from " daivãn-ãm, " which it is not ! ). Hence we shall have to pronounce ( probably ) : " tat savïtuh varainiyam For the same pronunciation speaks also other texts, like X, 139, lb; 12, 3d; 36, 14ab, cd; 149, la; I, 44, 8a; VI, 21, 9d ( cfr. 10b ). As regards the third päda of the Sâvitrï, the kavi could only have said in sensible language: " tat bhargah dhîmahi - y at..." - hence : 10c) dhiyah yat nah pracaudayät. Here we see the oral reciting-transmission ( as a factor, in the SK agency ) clearly at work through a haplology and assimilation : " dhiyo ya(n)na: dhiyo yo nah But the living style of the kavis is made manifest by the close parallel in IV, 53, 1 : a ) tat( ! ) daivasya savituh väriyam mahat b ) vriñinahai asurasya pracaitasah c ) chardih yaina( ! ) dãáusai yacchati tmanã d) tat nah mahãn ut ayãn daivah aktubhih. For confirmation cfr. VII, 52, 3; IV, 54, 4. But the SK must have found a pseudo-analogy in VI, 71, 2, even though it lacks the all-important " tat " in the prominent first place. Hence this beautiful gâyatrï was still more beautiful in the eyes of its composing rsi-kavi as being flawless in rhythm and style : 10a ) tat savituh varainiyam b ) bhargah daivasya dhîmahi c ) dhiyah yat nah pracaudayät.</page><page sequence="33">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 33 E. - The tristubh-jagatï: samples With this we have completed our text demonstration on the octo- syllabic verse. It has involved a concomitant demonstration as to the tristubh-jagatï metre too. But before we close this chapter we should like to offer two typical samples of this latter type of verse: I, 24, 15c ) athä vayam ãditya vratai tava ( ! ? ). &gt; This is in a tristubh-hymn ( with a gâyatrï trca in 3-5 ) none of whose 57 padas misses the intended final rhythm ; only this stray pada has 11 syllables, but a jagatl-ending. This is simply impossible for the kavi. He could only have said : 15c) athä vayam vratai tava + aaditya. But that gave to the SK ( through his younger prašlista ) only 10 sylla- bles! Hence he promptly reshuffles and recovers his 11 syllables by dodging the samdhi - at the ear-rending expense of a change from tro- chaic to iambic rhythm. But th9 rsi-kavi could and did resolve the long vowel in " ãditya " and make a praálista with the first element " tava + a-aditya " and thus keep his verse and his rhythm intact. And this by the way, is a direct refutation of the idea- entertained by other scholars - that in the Rgveda there is anything like " vocalis ante vocalem corripitur " = a vowel is shortened before another vowel There is nothing of the kind ! Pace Oldenberg, Wackernagel, et al. But of that more elsewhere. We see here how the paramountcy of the metre over the SK's samdhi ( his chief hobby-horse ! ) involves the undoing of a reshuffle and the employment of a combined archaism, which recurs elsewhere and will be shown in due course. The next example is also typical of the SK's method: I, 168, 10 ( = 165, 15): a ) aisa vah staumah marutdh iyam gïh ( N. B. ) b ) mãndãriyasya mãniyasya kãrauh c ) ãisã yãslsta tanvai vayãm ( = 9 ! ? ) = ã + isã vayãm tani&amp;vai yãsiista = ã + isã + avayãm „ ,, ( cfr. I, 173, 12b ) ? = ã + isã yãsista tanuvai avöyäm ( final solution ! ) ( cf. I, 166, 15c ; 167, Ile ; 173, 12b ; VII, 40, 5ab ; 1, 185, 8c ) I, 173, 12b ) asti hi smä tai áusminah av&lt;?yäh ( N. B. ) VII, 40, 5a ) asya daivasya mïdhusah avlyâh ( N.

I. ]</page><page sequence="34">34 Annals of the Bhandarlcar Oriental Research Institute the second initial place ( where all the protractable final vowels invaria- bly appear, except when the SK, for some reason of his own, drops them ). Mark the non-ksaipras in 10b. In 10c the metre is completely wrecked and it demands the unscrambling of the SK's abhinihita, as in the final solution above. Thus the metre is perfect and, at the same time, it makes obviously possible and doubly probable Oldenberg's emendation of " vayãm " into " ava-yäm" ( cfr. 1, 171, 6b; 173, 12b ), as Geldner points out in his translation, q. v. In this same hymn we find a jagatï stanza : la ) yajña-yajña vah samanã tuturvanih =12 b ) dhiyam-dhiyam vah daivayãh u dadhidhvai ( ! ? ) = „ „ „ daivayãh dadlñdht&amp;vai =12 c ) ã vo 'rvãcah suvitãya raudasyoh ( ! ? ) = „ vah arvãcah suvitãya raudasomA =12 d ) mahai vavrtyãm avasai suvrktibhih =12 Mark the protraction " inter breves " and the non-ksaipra in lb : M " dadhídhi&amp;vai which keeps the normal rhythm and shows that " u " is an SK's " pürana " to get his 12 syllables, though with a tristubh - rhythm ! ( How obvious ! ). In 1c note the SK's faked " abhinihita which wrecks the metre, and the substitution of the common " rauda- siyauh " ( which wrecks the final rhythm ) in place of the rare " rauda- s auh " ( as noted by Grassmann ), probably in order to get a rhythm similar to the one the same SK gets in lb with his " dadhidhve " ! ( Wheels within wheels ! ) Observe also the usual protraction of a final syllable " vah " in the second initial place, since - as we said - the ini- tial pre-yati rhythm is systematically iambic in the tristubh-jagatx metre. F . - The SK's feat and its difficult redress We have thus seen practically all the SK's redactorial tricks at work in the three chief kinds of metre. And in every case we have been able to recover the perfect handiwork of the rsi-kavis from under his Palimpsest - always relying on the paramountcy of metre and archaism together with parallelism. This will be sufficient for the present in order to give an approximate idea of the nature of the Samhitã-Palimpsest, as such, and also of the tremendous difficulties encountered by the SK when faced with such an archaic text so full, in his eyes, of verse-wrecking Samdhis and forms which the ancient kavis did not seem to mind, but which he, the woebegone redactor, was bound to observe according to the strictly enforced rules of his grammar !</page><page sequence="35">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 35 This will perforce conduce us to admire the expertise with which the SK could make such a relative best out of a bad job. For even though we ourselves, with a quantum of skill gained from long experience and with the added help and freedom of the archaisms, can manage to reconstruct and reshape the padas according to a standard rhythmical verse-pattern - the SK also achieved the same in innume- rable cases and that in «spite of the much greater handicaps which their anachronic grammar, phonetics and pronunciation imposed on him almost at every step. - The SK is really a virtuoso of the verse-cobbling and verse-patching craft - on account of which the indicia he leaves behind are often almost insignificant and barely sufficient for us to keep on his trail. Let us then pay our tribute of admiration to the SK's gigantic salvage-work : 40,000 verses learnt orally syllable by syllable, with- out any book, and then, what is more, re-edited by heart and yet so systematically ! We can only thank a benign Providence that so arranged things that the SK's human frailty should at times nod in the Homeric style so that we in later centuries ( and standing on the shoulders of so many generations of scholars, western and eastern alike ) could still catch him red-handed at his palimpsesting task. But let us confess again that it has been too long and too often a capital error of the rgvedic scholarship that the latter should have so easily been inclined, when faced by a flaw in the text, to say with reference to the rsi-Jcavis : " aliqtiando bonus dormitat Homerus In reality, as we have already said, the one responsible for those nods and naps must always on principle be the SK, who is always to be presumed guilty unless proven innocent. Or, better still, the responsi- bility is primary ours - our lack of comprehension of the SK's method and of the transmission factors previous to him - a thing that would deserve a chapter of its own. From all that has been here said up to now it is possible to get some idea of the immense labour that the work of text-critical reconstruc- tion of the original Rgveda entails - as it has for so long entailed for us - in order to un-edit and reconstitute each and every one of the syllables and words and rhythms of its 40,000 verses : for that implies a continuous and never-tiring criss-cross delving into that versified forest in search of parallels and counterchecks, following their track in the other vedic literature also ; but besides it requires a careful study and evaluation of the profusely abundant literature bearing on it in different languages, and the constant courage to frame and check working hypothesis of solution for special problems - hypothesis that will not seldom have to be modified or discarded for new, better, and finally, at long last!, definitive ones - in function of</page><page sequence="36">36 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute new facts and findings revealed by the uncovering of the Samhitã- palimpsest and its, at times, deeply embedded and disguised archaisms. The editors of the Mahãbhãrata could tell us a whole story about similar tasks and their at times almost backbreaking burden. Yet the ideal of reaching the coveted goal - of restoring to Mother India a Rgveda text - critically depurated, in a textual form antedat- ing the present traditional one by possibly five or more centuries, a form so immeasurably closer to the one given by the living rsi-kavis to that " monumentum aere perennius ", to that outstanding contri- bution of Indian literary creativity to the general human culture - that ideal is in itself an inestimable privilege, a psychological shot in the arm that - as a labour of love - can keep perpetually young at heart all its aspirants, as it has kept us all along, we are grateful to attest. III. RESULTS IN RETROSPECT AND IN PROSPECT How near have we got to that goal ? A. - Results obtained : methodological , textual 1. Their Nature First , we have fully and definitively established and defined the master-key for the breaking of the SK's palimpsesting code : namely, metre and archaism are paramount over the traditional text " as she is wrote " in the Samhitã-palimpsest - which is a Palimpsest to a much larger extent than envisaged up to now even by the great masters symbolised by Oldenberg. Second , more and more completely, and mostly definitively, the master-laws have been defined that preside over the text-critical reconstruction of the Rgveda . Those laws have been established as the fruit of our constant investigation, in particular about their systematic application, since some of them are or have been, to a larger or lesser extent, admitted by the best specialist scholars in that field. They are : a ) The substantially invariable scheme of versification and rhythm , particularly in the 8-, 11-, and 12-syllable verses ( anustubh, tristubh, jagati ) which are the predominant ones. The study of the others is practially complete, but will shortly receive the definitive shape, together with minor details in the initial rhythm of the three major types. b ) The principle of systematic and universal word-mobility - a key-concept and discovery, implicit in the master-key of metre and archaism but explicitly stated and tested and of decisive significance.</page><page sequence="37">The Quest for the Original Bgveda ä? c ) The archaic system of phonetics &gt; pronunciation , prosody , and samdhi ( as against the SK's one ) has been definitively settled. This is a point of capital importance, as we have seen in a telling test- probe above. d ) The systematic-universal application of the rhythmical protraction of short syllables, especially, but not only , " inter breves ". Another item of transcendent value. e ) The systematic-universal application of vowel-and - diphthong-resolution . A point of no less momentum. f ) The principle of editorial subsidiarity has been formulated and found valid : to save the essentials at the cost of accidentals - a natural bent. g ) The discovery of linguistic archaisms ( of the tpye of the well-known " tubhya, pavãka, daivãm " etc. ) far beyond the accepted ones - with their reliable proofs. One of the most important and consequence-rich ones is that of the archaic dative " daivãi " ( vs. " daivãya " ), parallel to the Avestic one, about whose problem and reliable proof we dealt in two major essays, read, one at International Congress of Orientalists in New Delhi (1964) and now in course of publication - and another at the A. I. O. C. Session at Gauhati ( 1965 ), already published. This is a discovery that in our opinion is of very great value both for philological studies and rgvedic textual criticism. ( It is one of those that is bound to alter even authoritative views like those expressed in Wackernagers "Grammatik" III, and in T. Burrow's " The Sanskrit Language ", q. v. ). h ) The principle of textual substitution addition , suppression and modification of grammatical forms and words - all made by the SK in function of his rhythm, language state, and of other factors of redaction and transmission. This is of great consequence for the text. i ) Progressive elimination of previous provisional working hypothesis - like the exclusion of a possibility of general use of rhyme, and its limitation to particular, though widespread, sporadic cases and to a peculiar group of hymns, especially the well-known Parucchepa ones ( I, 127-139 ), which will furnish before long a convincing final proof of our whole method and principles. On its thorough text-critical study we are engaged in a research-work we are preparing under the far-seeing auspices of the U. G. C. Scheme for Retired Teachers, and of which we gave a test-sample in the above-mentioned paper for the I. C. O. ( New Delhi ). j ) Progressive and often definitive confirmation of the pre- vious results and hypotheses in the light of new discoveries, especial- ly of corroborative archaisms.</page><page sequence="38">38 AnnaU of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute k. ) Simplification and improvement of solutions previously given to textual problems - and that always in function of the original key-principle : namely, the absolute paramountcy of rhythm and archaism over the vulgate traditional Samhita-text. Third : As a consequence of the methodological and text-critical progress sketched above the concrete result is gradually turning out to be a depurated text of decidedly more archaic texture , clarified in innumerable points of detail, both in the poetic-metrical form and in matters of content also, even in things of some importance - though in general it can be said, as it was to be expected, that the overall substantial import of the Rgveda remains practically the same. And here is the place to remark that, considering the tenacity and marvellous accuracy of the fwstf-Samhitä transmission, one is not surprised to find the relatively younger and fundamentalist view of some conservative circles : namely, that the rgvedic text is an eternally fixed and immutably preserved one. It is a heart-born wishful projection and amplification of the - as we have said - very unique and astounding fact of the ^osč-Samhita transmission " miracle ". But the facts and the testimony of the texts themselves and of their handling by the vedic áãkhãs point the way to the other, more rational, opinion : namely, that the rsi-kavis expressed their inspired thoughts in their own language, and that this language was subject to the laws of linguistic development and transmission, and that, consequently, its transmitters ( especially when they were relatively nearer to the times of origin and less influenced by later and extreme canonical theories ) were more concerned - like the Mahãbhãrata and Rãmãyana trans- mitters - with the " artha " than with the material "áabda" of the hymns, and were more desirous of vindicating for them a standard correction and a sufficiently intelligible-grammatical language than a mechanical " abracadabra " sound-echo fidelity at all costs. They had not yet entirely crossed the boundary into the swamps of magic where "mantra" becomes "yantra", divorcing the word from the spirit of " man " ( to think ) in order to make it seek only the power of " yam " ( to control and subjugate ) at any price. Of that so realistically conceived text, as a vulgate edition of an ancient primordial text, the original transmitters up to and includ- ing the SK can say : " We all had a hand in it ", the hand of linguistic transmission forces and influences, the hand of redactorial retouching, trying to improve while preserving. And the natural result was - as in the Mahãbhãrata and Rãmãyana , but halted earlier and within narrower confines - a real "palimpsest", which we trust to be able to set on its definitive way to its unimpaired pristine state.</page><page sequence="39">The Quest for the Original Rgveda 39 8. Their Importance The above exposition and sample-test can give an idea of what the labour of love of this investigation and its discoveries signify culturally and philologically, since they concern a key-text of the comparative philological and cultural Indo-European studies and restore it to the original form that it had possessed centuries before its present traditional form - thus throwing new light upon its remotest stages. I have no doubt that vedic studies will have to be renovated and corrected even in important points, especially in lexicography, grammar, philology, and exegesis, besides metrics and phonetic archaism. Various monographic essays have been published by me or are in course of publication in specialist Journals or in the Proceedings of learned bodies and several more are in preparation - especially the above-mentioned work on the Parucchepa hymns which I intend to make into a sort of " Prolegomena " to a critical edition of the Rgveda in function of the method here propounded. In fact this address is a sort of outline of such " Prolegomena 3 . Their Quality : Provisional definitive About those publications of mine up to the present I have to say in retrospect that I firmly believe that they contain a central directive line and approach - of metre and archaism together with word - mobility - which is scholarly solid and permanent and will stand up to any criticism in its essentials . As far as the detailed individual results are concerned, they are, as rlready indicated, to be considered as generally provisional , till we can reach a point where we feel that all the possible factors and pertinent texts have been duly taken into consideration. But increasingly many of those theoretically provisional results are continually passing to the category of deñnitive acquisitions by being corroborated in the light of further converging confirmations from similar texts and facts ; while, at the same time, the same test has already discarded many other preliminary or tentative solutions in favour of newer and better ones- yet always along the fundamental direction indicated above. And it is precisely this "compass-constant" as we might term it, that has given us courage and perseverance at all stages, in the firm persuasion that, because of it, we were sure to be on the right track in that veritable cross-country obstacle race of our text-critical quest. For obstacles and difficulties there have been galore- with failed attempts and false steps and wrecked working hypotheses leading in the end up blind alleys of refractory data and unyielding texts. But we have tried consistently to remain on the plane of auto-criticism and readiness for</page><page sequence="40">40 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute self-correction while at the same time accepting and objectively evaluating any kind of constructive criticism from fellow-scholars. It is the only way that leads to real progress and guarantees valuable results - as I hope further to obtain. Yet my would-be critics are kindly requested to take into account that many things that in this new approach appear at first sight as unusual and surprising will acquire quite a new look if they persevere in following up the process of demonstration through the meandering ways and by-ways of parallel facts and texts spread over the whole Sarhhitã. The force of converging probabilities is a force that has often led us to unexpected results, and will do the same with whomsoever can possess his soul in patience and go through the multi-secular and multitudinous rgvedic forest trusting to the Ariadne thread of a systematic factual and consistent approach. Our last two essays presented at New Delhi and Gauhati and a recent long article in the Indian Antiquary, IV, 1 ( Jan. 1967 ) contain a good many definitive results and discoveries - more especially the important one of the archaic -ài dative for the -a-declension ( "daiväi" ) instead of the classical "d eväya", already mentioned - and they mark a definitive phase in our research and in the formulation of our approach to the textual criticism of the Rgveda. B. - The ultimate Prospect And it is my firm conviction that with the plan, method and principles propounded here the ground is sufficiently broken to lay the solid scholarly foundation to the "magnum opus" - I would rather call it for India " maximum opus " - of a text-critical edition not of the Samhitã-Palimpsest ( for that has been excellently done by the "Vaidik Samšodhana Mandai " here in Poona ) but of the original Rgveda of the rsi-kavis which lies beyond and beneath that marvellous- ly preserved " Palimpsest Will it be the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute that, as in the case of the Mahãbhãrata , will take the lead and co-ordinate the treasures of talent and ability of Indian Rgvedic scholars and institutions of learning towards that beckoning goal of such a text-critical " maximum opus " ?
