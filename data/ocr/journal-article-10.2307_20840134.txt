<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CRITICAL APPROACH TO THE AVICENNIAN DISTINCTION OF ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE YASIN CEYLAN The separation of an entity into essence and existence was first made by al-Farabi in Muslim Philosophy.1 It was adopted by Ibn SIna, his successor, alongside with some other doctrines formulated by the former, such as those on prophecy and intellect. Ibn SIna elaborated and moulded it into a clear-cut doctrine. Attempts at implicating Aristotle in this theory have so far remained vague and unsatisfactory.2 This observation is further supported by Ibn Rushd's severe attack on Ibn SIna on behalf of Aristotle over this issue.3 Ibn Rushd's stand on this question is of immense significance, since his interpretation of Aristotle's works has not yet been seriously challenged.4 Ibn SIna's account of this doctrine is as follows: Things have essences, which differentiate them from each other, and existence which is common to all. Their contingent nature does not entitle them to possess this quality permanently. Thus, if anything happens to exist, its existence is provided by an external source, whose nature is not similar to that of the contingent, and therefore inseparable into essence and existence. However, the essence of any entity is not the cause of its existence. If it were so, it would entail the existence of the essence before it actually exists, as the cause is always prior to the effect. It remains that any notion of an essence before it unites with existence is to be ascribed to God's mind. Thus, although existence is additional to essence, the latter cannot be predicated of, before it obtains this quality.5 Regarding existence as an additional quality, and essence as suscep tible to it, has led some philosophers to accuse Ibn SIna of considering existence as an accident and therefore elicited severe criticism from them.6 Since all accidents falling in the ten Aristotelian Categories are unsubstantial qualities added to an essence, without which the essence can still survive, likewise it should stay on after it is deprived of this quality. But how can any essence continue existing after it is removed of existence? As no satis</page><page sequence="2">330 Islamic Studies, 32:3 (1993) factory answer can be given to this question it is better to scrutinize further the meaning of the term "accident" used for existence. Otherwise, it would not be befitting for a philosopher like Ibn Sina not to see the inconsistency in equating existence with other accidents. The special meaning that Ibn Sina attaches to the word 'arad in Arabic as equivalent of "accident" in this context, is the suitability of existence for the essence to receive it, as it is the case with all variety of accidents. Apart from this common feature with other accidents there is no similarity between them.7 Taking Ibn Sina's use of the word in this sense may explain away difficulties on this point. One of the reasons why Ibn Sina expounded this doctrine is that he was dissatisfied with Aristotle's formula of matter and form. According to this formula, through the combination of form and matter the reality of a thing arises. Prior to this combination matter and form do not exist. Ibn Sina's anxiety is: how can something existential come into being out of two non-existent elements? Thus, there is something missing in this doctrine. After the combination of these two, there is need for a third factor to force it into being. This must be "existence" conferred by God.8 Therefore, treat ing all existentials in this way, God's dynamic role in creative activity is also secured. Ibn Sina's second concern for developing this line of approach seems to be more crucial than the first. This is to differentiate between God, the Necessary Being and the rest of the existents, the contingent beings, for while defining the latter as consisting of essence and existence, he defines the former as pure existence, or as the one whose existence is identical with his essence. Another well-known distinction that he draws between God and the Universe is that God's existence is self-sufficient, unaided or unaffected by an external source, whereby He is rightly called Necessary Being, while the existence of the rest of beings is not self-determined but is derived from an external cause, whereby they are called contingent beings.9 Therefore, his distinction of essence and existence for the contingent beings is a corollary of this major theory. Now, after this brief account of our philosopher's doctrine and ascer taining his anxieties which he wanted to remove thereby, let us make the critique of this doctrine which is the purpose, of this paper. The concept of "existence" is the widest in capacity and the most comprehensive in meaning in any language. It comprises all the perceptible</page><page sequence="3">Islamic Studies, 32:3 (1993) 331 and the intelligible entities. Therefore, it has no genus, i.e. there is no wider concept to include it. If it cannot be contained by another concept it cannot be defined as well. Since, in all definitions the term to be defined is included into a wider and a better known concept, as in the example of "man is a rational animal". In this statement the extension of the concept animal is wider than that of the concept man. As we are unable to find a wider concept in extension than existence it remains undefined. This characteristic of the term, while contributing to its ambiguity, is also the token of its clarity and universality. In other words as it is so comprehensive?accompanying any external or internal perception?it is also like tacit knowledge, in need of no stronger evidence to substantiate it.10 On the other hand, being so, it dazzles human mind and escapes any attempt of identification in the under standing. This pecularity has led some philosophers alongside with Ibn Sina to regard it as an intelligible, capable of subsisting independent of the percep tible. Elevated to the status of the supersensible, it becomes the most objec tive reality unsusceptible to the limitations of human understanding.11 These limitations in the case of perception have been recognised by the majority of modern philosophers. But whether they are also in force in the case of so-called intelligibles or not is a question to be tackled in this article. Ibn Sina touches upon this question while treating being (existence) as the subject-matter of the First Philosophy on three levels. (a) Things the existence of which is not dependent on the percep tible. Such as existence, oneness, necessity. (b) Things the existence of which is separable only in imagination while in reality it is inseparable from the perceptible, such as square, triangle. (c) Things, the existence of which is not separable from the exist ing matter, such as a stone, a tree, etc.12 According to this classification concepts like existence, oneness, necessity are purely intellectual and are independent of perception. Thus, the limitations of human understanding i.e. the relativity of human know ledge, is implicitly ruled out. This impression about Ibn Sum's position can further be strengthened by his argument for self-congnition in a state of absolute void, with no access to any sort of perception.13 If we interpret self-congnition as consciousness of the existence of the self, then it is obvious that Ibn Sina does not recognise any necessary role for perception in this process. Our criticism of essence-existence dualism will rest on the falsifica tion of this claim.</page><page sequence="4">332 Islamic Studies, 32:3 (1993) It is apparent that whenever we think of something, it necessarily exists. It exists irrespective of whether the thing thought of is something in the external world or something created by the imaginative faculty, the only difference is that the first has a real existence while the second has an imaginary one. But if we go through an internal observation of any sensation we will realize that awareness of something or knowledge of existence of an object is conditional on the rise of the image of that object in imagination, otherwise, we will be immune to its existence or to the acquisition of any knowledge about it. Thus, what actually exists in the actual world has its existentional counterpart in the imagination. Existence of images in the imagination is the result of the existence of objects in the real world. There fore, what does not exist, has no counterpart in the imagination i.e. has no imaginary existence, and whatever exists in the imagination has its real antecedent in the world of reality. We may well accept this claim, but how can it account for dreams, fiction and phantasies which may have no coun terpart in the real world? This difficulty can be removed by the contention that all these unreal images are the creative works of the imaginative faculty. This faculty invents artificial images by using the previous impressions of the real things as their raw material. It is in a perpetual process of making syntheses but always uses the images of the real things or parts of them in these combinations. These syntheses when carried out systematically either produce science or science-fiction or metaphysics. When they are unsystema tic they emerge as dreams and phantasies. In either case it never uses non existential properties. What we call phantasy is the blend of various elements of the existential images of the real objects, but conducted in such a way that rationality is overcome by passions or emotions in the course of synthesis. That is why it does not fit in an actual object in reality. From this analysis it can be inferred that without the imaginative power it is impossible to have any knowledge of things including their exis tence. Moreover, the imagination can work only on the images of the existing objects in reality. It can never have the image of something that does not exist; and that it can never invent new creative images unrelated to the images of the real things. However, the imaginative power preserves the images of things that disappear in time. This may cause considerable confu sion. It also forces us to tackle the problem of existence from a different point of view: The role of time in the concept of existence is the centre of this new perspective. We all know that the perception of the existentials and their move ments is momentary. As everything in the universe is in a process of change, the two images of the same thing in two moments are not identical, though we may not be aware of this change. Awareness of change is possible when it is easily noticeable i.e. when the degree of change is high. Especially when</page><page sequence="5">Islamic Studies, 32:3 (1993) 333 there is a dramatic turn in the shape or the movement of an object we get the impression that objects in certain shapes and behaviour disappear, and new forms and actions replace them. While these shapes and behaviours disappear with the passage of time, and so do their real images, their images prior to their disappearances are still kept in the imagination. Here is a problem. We retain the image of something which no longer exists. If we regard this image as the essence of the disappeared thing we are inevitably led to the conclusion that essences can be thought of while they are devoid of real existence. Hence the division of an existent into essence and existence. But if due attention is paid to the problem it will be seen that this is not the necessary conclusion. First of all, the image of the thing that disappears is the image of something which existed in reality, and it carries with it all the properties of an existential image. Even if the antecedent of this image has perished, it possesses an imaginary existence in the imagination. Thus, as an image, it is still a unity of essence and existence. Since it has not been perceived separately, it is not kept as two partite image. As a matter of fact, our awareness of the existence of things?which means their essences as well?is always through images, and imaginary existence is not an unfounded existence, it is always the reflection of real existence. In this argument, what we want to show is that the images of the perished things are not devoid of existence. Secondly, since all things are in a state of flux there is no identity between the two images of the "same thing". Consequently, the antecedents of all images disappear and perish in time. Thus, there is no difference among the factual images (creative images of the imagination are different) in the imagination, whether their antecendents are present in the process of perception or have perished in time. Because even in the first case, when the image is formed, the time is already past. Our last inferences which revolve around time factor lead us to the discussion of a new topic: Nothingness.14 Absolute nothingness is inconceivable. We can only imagine the no thingness of existing things. Total privation independent of existentials can never be imagined. Thus, our conception of nothingness is limited by the existing world. We can think of nothingness as much as we can think of existence. By existence we only mean the existence of the existentials. The limit of existence is determined by the volume of existing phenomena. It, should not be extended beyond this limit. Attempts at transcending this border will always fail, as any progress of imagination in this field will be supported by the properties of the existential, thus, not exceeding the existing universe. That existence includes what we are not aware of, is an unfounded presupposition. If we are unable to think of nothingness by itself, without recourse</page><page sequence="6">334 Islamic Studies, 32:3 (1993) to the things that exist, nothingness becomes a corollary of existence, or prompted by it. ft is noticed due to the principle of change in the world of phenomena. In other words it is only because of time that nothingness (of an existential) is conceived. Therefore, nothingness in a way, is product of time. Time is also a factor that makes knowledge possible for human beings, while preventing them from viewing the existing things in totality. By a different equation it can be claimed that if it were not for the fact that things proceed into nothings?and so their real images?it would be impossible for man to know anything. As a non-existent cannot be thought of, existence can only be the prime quality of the existential. Thus, every existing entity has this quality. Even imaginary entities, as argued above, are the products of the existential. If it is so comprehensive a quality permeating real and imaginary things it cannot be a distinctive quality distinguishing something from another. If everything possesses this quality it cannot be a point of distinction. Difference between things that do not exist cannot be made. It can only be made between things that exist. Since every existing entity necessarily has this quality of existence, difference among them is due to the differences among their essences. No essence can be considered abstracted from existence. Then, how is it possible at all, to separate essence from existence? The only ground for such a separation is the difference between an image of a past perception and that of a present one. On close scrutiny this discrepancy disappears, and the conception of essence abstracted from existence remains a fruitless effort. Taking this for granted can we claim that existence comes first and is even prior to essence, as the modern existentialists have claimed? Indeed, this is the other version of the question. Existence, like other universal concepts depends on the existential. Since, it is the most universal and the comprehensive quality, it gives the impression that it is an independent idea, unconnected to the material world. But in reality, existence cannot be conceived without the inclusion of the existing things. Thus, if it is impossible to think of existence without essence and of essence without existence, to make a distinction between them is an artificial endeavour. Ibn Sina's definition of God as pure existence, or existence without essence is also a controversial issue.15 Fakhr al-DIn al-Razi criticises it while commenting on al-Ishdrdt wa'l-Tanblhat. He rightly raises the question of the identity of existence common both to man and God. Ibn Sina's contention that God's existence is different from that of man on point of necessity, does not seem to be satisfactory.16 On the other hand, if one of the purposes of this definition is to distinguish God from the rest of the contingent beings, it is again deficient as al-Gazzali points out; for, it still denotes duality in</page><page sequence="7">Islamic Studios, 32:3 (1993) 335 God's reality, namely existence and necessity.17 Thus, even in this definition, God's unity has not been preserved. Secondly, ascribing any concept to God as legitimate predicate has human implications in it. This is valid even in the proposition "God exists". For existence is the existence of which we perceive or are aware of, and not a transcendental one.18 The proposition can be interpreted as "We are aware of God's existence as we are aware of the existence of other things". This will in turn, reduce his existence to the realm of perception. Because, a higher or different type of existence is inaccessible to human understanding. In the above analysis, divine existence, like other divine attributes, obtains a human element, and therefore a limitation. This situation runs contrary to the claim that God is superior to anything human. On this account Muslim philosophers accused the theologians of anthropomorphism. Now it seems that they themselves are not free from it. The analysis of the concept of "existence" through self-consciousness adds new dimensions to the problem. Self-consciousness is the highest mode of awareness. This awareness encompasses all the activities of the self. As the concept of "existence" is an outcome of the activities of the self, thinking about the self is in a way, thinking about everything that exists. Thus, existents in general (existence) and self, fully concentrated and condensed, are closely linked with each other. Attempts at penetrating into the under standing of "existence" is tantamount to the understanding of the self itself. It is known that in all cognitive and practical activities of the self "I" is implied. It is "I" who sees, hears, knows, walks and writes. However, all these things and movements exist. Existence accompanies all these things, though it is omitted as an unnecessary addition. Now we have here two comprehensive concepts, equally accompany ing every existential. Whatever I know and do, necessarily exists; and what ever exists is somehow related to me. The analysis of either of them will contribute to the understanding of the other. Moreover, "existence", while permeating all the categories of the understanding, cannot transgress it. It remains within the sphere of the understanding. Thus, it is not wider than the "self' itself. The "self as the centre of any cognition and emotion is the most comprehensive phenomenon as far as man is concerned. The con cept of "existence" transcends the boundary of any one of the twelve Kantian Categories of the understanding, yet, it is imprisoned by their capacity being combined. Thus, what determines human knowledge and robs it of absolute ness, determines the nature of this concept too, and makes it finite. Therefore, man's sense of existence is a kind of knowledge. But it</page><page sequence="8">336 Islamic Studies, 32:3 (1993) differs from any particular knowledge in being a primary knowledge, condi tional for the validity of other types of knowledge. If it is a type of knowledge, though a basic and a general one, it is subject to human limitations. The inference to be drawn from all these is that whatever exists, exists only insofar as man is capable of being aware of it. And whatever exists beyond this limitation is unknown to man and therefore does not exist. Unless we predicate of God's existence negatively i.e. "His existence is unlike ours", any existential predicate used for Him falls within the sphere of human limitations and is therefore untranscendental. These arguments are intended to show that Ibn Sina's definition of God as "pure existence" or that "His essence is His existence" are ambiguous statements and that when closely examined, the concepts used in them (i.e. existence, essence) carry the relativity of human understanding and are therefore finite. In conclusion, Ibn Sina's treatment of existence, like other philosophi cal problems, bears medieval characteristics. It is viewed as an objective reality unperturbed by human limitations. Strict rationalism elevates it to the degree of absoluteness, whereas if the role of time and man's imaginative faculty are taken into account, the supposed absolute quality of the "concept of existence" is thrown into doubt. While raising such fundamental questions about our philosopher's view of "existence", I cannot help appreciating his full grasp of the issue and his contribution towards the analysis of the concept. Human beings are by nature, incapable of viewing an issue from all possible aspects. With the passage of time new treatments of the same issue from different perspectives will naturally follow. This is how philosophical heritage builds up. Thus, a philosopher cannot be accused of not noticing all dimensions of an issue. Rather what is required of him is to be consistent in whatever respect he handles an issue. In this last point, it can be confidently maintained that Ibn Sma is fairly succesful.
