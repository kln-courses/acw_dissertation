<plain_text><page sequence="1">252] Recent Literature Bird-Banding and around this great city to look for birds, with detailed descriptions of parks, beaches, mountains, and piers where birds might be seen, what species are likely to be encountered, and how to get there. Some of these places are illustrated by maps. Good tips on the identification of the birds, advice on aids (binoculars and song recordings) are of assistance to the beginner. Eighty of the more common birds are illustrated by William C. Dilger's delicate pen-drawings. Among many other useful features are a bird-watcher's calendar and information on localities and dates where and when he may look for the arrival of migrating birds. It is amazing to find that areas so radically changed by man contain so great a variety of wildlife. The book may therefore well serve as a good model for similar guides to cover the birdlife of other metropolitan centers.-Louise de K. Lawrence. 42. A Sand County Almanac with Other Essays on Conservation from Round River. Aldo Leopold. Illustrated by Charles W. Schwartz. 1966. Oxford University Press, New York, 269 pp. $6.50. The book that Dr. Donald S. Farner reviewed so favorably in Bird-Banding 21: 78-79, 1950 has been re- printed in what the editors call an "Enlarged Edition," but nothing has been added that warrants enlarging Dr. Farner's review, although one of his comments might be changed. He wrote, "Every thinking open-minded citizen should read this" and probably thought the book would thus advance the course of conserva- tion. In the nearly 20 years since this book was first published great "progress" has been made in the destruction and pollution of natural resources. It is therefore my wish that the book be read by the many citizens whose closed minds need prying open-.Elizabeth S. Austin. 43. The Birds of Canada. W. Earl Godfrey. 1966. Bull. No. 203 National Mus. of Canada, Biol. Series No. 73, Queen's Printer, Ottawa, 69 color plates by John A. Crosby, 71 line drawings by S. D. MacDonald, 428 pp. $12.50. Thirty years ago P. A. Taverner published the first complete Birds of Canada (Musson) containing both eastern and western species. Today the present book is in a sense complementary to Travener's work, in that it contains additional and up-to-date data of a science that in the intervening years has developed in a spectacular way in methods of research, accuracy, and amassed knowledge as well as in popu- larity. A total of 518 species are described, all represented by a Canadian specimen, with the exception of the Snew (Mergellus albellus) for which adequate color photo- graphs exist. Species whose occurrence are based on sight records alone are treated as hypothetical. A few diversions from the rulings of the American Ornithologists' Union's Check-list of North Ameiican Birds (Fifth Edition, 1957) are adopted. These include the treatment of Branta nigricans as conspecific with B. bernicla, Chen hyperborea with C. caerulescens, and Buteo harlani with B. jamaicensis. Larus argentatus thayeri, however, is treated as a separate species, L. thayeri. The descriptions of each species contain plumages, measurements (except length), field marks, habitats, nesting, egg measurements, general range and breeding distribution in Canada, the latter illustrated by 377 excellent maps. Available data on incubation periods are always given with source of reference. In the case of the Slate-colored Junco (Junco hyemalis) on page 390, I question, however, from my own experience F. L. Burns' findings that both sexes share in the incubation. Food and economic status are not regularly included in the descriptions but often touched upon in the author's remarks. These sections, which follow the descriptions of many species, are interesting, apt, and character- istically permeated with the author's keen concern about conservation. On the Gannet (Morus bassanus) he departs slightly from his well-disciplined scientific style to let his admiration for these birds discreetly break through his choice of words, only in the last sentence to withdraw again behind a practical piece of information, that the Gannets of Bonaventure bring to the village of Perce no less than $100,000 annually in tourist trade. The meticulous care in checking and verifying all data runs through the work as an unassailable distinction. Obviously, the author set as his goal an authentic presentation beyond anything previously produced on the subject, to which end no effort was spared and no amount of patient research was neglected. So is, for instance, the alleged occurrence of the Red-faced Cormorant (Phalacrocorax urile),</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXXVIII Recent Literature 1967 [253 included in Taverner's list, convincingly repudiated (p. 34) by means of careful examination of a single puzzling specimen, thus eliminating the continuation for great lengths of time of an easily made mistake, the bane of compilations of this kind. Crosby's colored illustrations are eminently successful. His birds are posed freely in n-atural and pleasing surroundings, showing in flight or in repose often two or three plumage phases of usually, very good coloring. Particularly helpful is the placing of the autumn warblers together with birds in spring plumage and in groups of very similar species, thus giving the reader excellent opportunities of intra- as well as interspecific comparisons. Plate 60, for instance, shows remark- ably well detailed plumages of the Connecticut (Oporornis agilis) and the Mourn- ing warblers (0. phitladelphia). The work is astonishingly clear of typographical errors. An inadvertent anthropomorphism appears oln page 230, where it is stated that the male Ruby- throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) does not take part in the "drudgery" of incubation and raising of the young. In the descriptionis of colors the habit of adding the qualifying ending "ish" (yellowish, whitish) is perhaps unnecessarily prevalent, and the presence and absence of hyphens (mixedwoods, mid-day, under parts) have me slightly puzzled. But the excellence of the work would scarcely be duly appreciated without negligible irregularities. Significantly, the book was consistently on the Canadian non-fiction best-seller list for at least three weeks after publication and still appears on it intermittently, testimonial enough not onily of its popular appeal but of its value as an attractive and scholarly work on the avifauna of Canada.-Louise de K. Lawrence. 44. A Life Time with the Birds. An Ornithological Logbook. Earle R. Greene. 1966. Edwards Bros., Inc., 2500 S. State St., Ann Arbor, Mich. 404 pp. $6. Earle Greene is a cordial, very friendly man who greatly enjoys birds and bird people. He has written a chatty, informal record of a life time largely concerned with these two subjects. Professionally he was Refuge Manager for the U. S. Biological Survey at Lake Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina, at Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia, and at the Great White Heron and Key West Refuges in Florida. His bibliography, mainly concerned with birds of the southeastern states, runs to eight pages. His "Life List" of over 600 species seen in North America north of the Mexican border fills 28 pages; with each species are listed the states or provinces in which the birds were seen. There are 110 photographs in the book, some excellent, others rather indistinct. The volume closes with an index of the names of birds and persons. It is interesting to read of the nesting of exotics, originally escapees from aviaries, two species in California, six in Florida. In "Parakeet Village" on Treas- ure Island, not far from St. Petersburg, hundreds of Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) have nested in freedom during the last five years. In a rookery of White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) Mr. Carter Bundy of Miami introduced a number of eggs of the Scarlet Ibis (E. ruber) from Venezuela with the consequence that some of these gorgeous birds are now nesting in the rookery. After "retirement" in 1956 Mr. Greene is an enthusiastic as ever, driving over the couLntry, avid to visit his many friends and to see new birds for his life list. Let me quote: "When the average person reaches three score and ten years of age, he decides to take it easy, enjoy the rocking chair on the front porch or sit in his patio, read or look at television, or perhaps sleep the time away. Not so with the student of birds or one who has a serious passion on some subject vital to him. This person keeps on until he is called to the Happy Hunting Ground." May this good fate be the author's!-Margaret M. Nice. 45. The Birds of Tikal. Frank B. Smithe. 1966. The Natural History Press, Garden City, N. Y. 350 pp. $7.50. I have bee'n asked to review this ex- cellent new field book chiefly because my husband and I spent six months in 1965- 66 exploring and observing birds through central British Honduras and Peten, Guatemala. We made no collections but did some mistnetting. Later we joined C. Russell Mason, Mrs. Margeret Hundley and Sr. Jorge Ibarra (an outstanding naturalist in the country) for four days of intensive birding at Tikal, followed by four days of observations mostly by dugout canoe along the Rio de la Pasion in southwest Peten. Still later, in 1967, at Santa Elena on the shore of Lake Peten,</page></plain_text>
