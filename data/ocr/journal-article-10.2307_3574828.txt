Estimation of Breast Doses and Breast Cancer Risk Associated with Repeated Fluoroscopic Chest Examinations of Women with Tuberculosis. Radiat. Res. 73, 373-390 (1978). A methodology is presented to estimate cumulative breast dose and breast cancer risk for women exposed to repreated fluoroscopic chest examinations during air collapse therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. Medical record abstraction, physician interview, patient contact, machine exposure measurements, and absorbed dose computations were combined to estimate average breast doses for 1047 Massachusetts women who were treated between 1930 and 1954. The methodology presented considers breast size and composition, patient orientation, X-ray field size and location, beam quality, type of examination, machine exposure rate, and exposure time duiing fluoroscopic examina- tions. The best estimate for the risk of radiation-induced cancer for the women living longer than 10 years after initial fluoroscopic exposure is 6.2 excess breast cancers per million woman-year-rad with 90% confidence limits of 2.8 and 10.7 cancers/106 WY-rad. When breast cancer risk is considered as a function of absorbed dose in the breast, instead of as a function of the number of fluoroscopic examinations, a linear dose-response relationship over the range of estimated doses is consistent with the data. However, because of the uncertainty due to small-sample variability and because of the wide range of assumptions regarding certain fluoroscopy conditions, other dose-response relationships are compatible with the data. INTRODUCTION To estimate the possible radiation hazard associated with periodic X-ray mammography examinations, risk estimates of radiation-induced breast cancer 1 Supported in part by a center grant (5 P10 ES00002) from the National Institute of Environ- mental Health Sciences and by a Public Health Service contract (223-75-6014) from the Bureau of Radiological Health, Food and Drug Administration, Public Health Service, U.

None of these series, however, represents a population that has been exposed under conditions similar to those under which women undergoing periodic mammography, are exposed, i.e., low-energy (25-50 kVp) and low-dose diagnostic X-ray examinations repeatedly performed over a number of years. The atomic bomb irradiation was a single whole-body exposure to high-energy y rays and neutrons. The mastitis patients were treated for a breast disease by therapeutic X rays (175-270 kVp), and the radiation was delivered in one to several high-dose fractions over a period of about a week. The women with tuberculosis, on the other hand, received repeated low-energy (70-85 kVp) and relatively-low-dose fluoroscopic exposures to diagnostic X rays that continued for an average of 3-5 yr. The estimation of the radiation dose received by the Nova Scotia women was, however, so unreliable that the National Academy of Sciences chose the value of the postpartum mastitis study, six cases of breast cancer/106 woman-year-rad5, as their best estimate of the absolute risk for radiation-induced breast cancer (1). To augment existing data on risk estimates for the induction of breast cancer by ionizing radiation (1-7), a followup study was conducted of pulmonary tuberculosis patients in two Massachusetts hospitals who received repeated fluoroscopic examinations of the chest during air collapse treatments of the lung (pneumothorax and pneumoperitoneum) (8). To obtain information on the cumulative breast doses received by these patients, an extensive methodology, described in this report, was developed. These dose estimates were derived by abstracting information from medical records, interviewing physicians, contacting patients, measuring X-ray exposures from representative fluoroscopes, and applying an absorbed dose calculation scheme that employs a Monte Carlo radiation transport technique. Average absorbed breast doses were estimated for each patient fluoroscopically examined. On the basis of the observed frequency of breast cancers in the exposed population, estimates of breast cancer risk were made, and the resulting dose-response relationship was examined. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Study Population Female patients who were discharged alive from two Massachusetts hospitals between 1930 and 1954 were studied (8). The numbers of pneumothorax or pneumoperitoneum treatments were determined from the hospital records, and 1047 women were designated as exposed individuals. The comparison group 6 Absolute risk estimates as presented in the BEIR report (1) derive from the following calcula- tions: (0 - E)/[(WY) (D)] where 0 = observed cases, E = expected cases, WY = woman- years at risk for breast cancer development, and D = average breast dose in rad. The absolute excess risk estimate is specific for the years of followup included in the calculation. The postpartum mastitis estimate excludes the first 10 yr of followup, and is applicable for years 10 to 29 after initial exposure. 374</page><page sequence="3">BREAST CANCER FOLLOWING X-RAY EXPOSURE TABLE I Sanatorium X-Ray Experience Exposed group Comparison group Number of women 1047 717 Fluoroscopy exams (av) 102 Years fluoroscoped (av) 3.3 Exams/year 31 Chest X rays (av) 49 30 X Rays/year as an: In patient 5.1 5.8 Out patient 2.1 1.8 consisted of 717 sanatorium patients who did not receive air collapse therapy and the associated repeated fluoroscopic exposures. For patients undergoing pneumotherapy, air was injected into the pleural or peritoneal cavity in order to collapse the lung. For a period of several years, additional air was required every 1-3 weeks, and a fluoroscopic examination was conducted each time to determine the quantity of air needed to maintain the lung collapse. Table I shows the X-ray experience of the study population. The exposed women averaged 102 fluoroscopic examinations each, and air collapse treatment continued for an average of 3.3 yr. The exposed women averaged 49 radiographic chest X rays versus 30 for the comparison group. Patient Questionnaire A mail questionnaire was sent to the 1146 women found alive as of July 1975. Of the 675 exposed women who were sent the questionnaire, 543 responded. These 675 women were asked whether they remembered the physician's fluoro- scopic procedure. Specifically, the patient was queried about whether she faced the physician or had her back to him during the fluoroscopy, whether her orienta- tion varied, and whether she was rotated.

Information with regard to three different fluoroscopic field sizes was also obtained. In order to specify the X-ray fields on the phantom used in the absorbed dose calculations, the physicians were asked to sketch the body areas that would be included in the X-ray field during specific fluoroscopic examinations. The X-ray fields selected to be compatible with these sketches are summarized in Table IV. Fluoroscopy Exposure Measurements Laboratory measurements were made on three representative fluoroscopy units: a Victor (G.E.) Vertical Fluoroscope, Model B751 (1922), a Fisher Vertical Fluoroscope, Type X (1925), and a Picker Vertical Fluoroscope, Style T-10 (1935). One of the fluoroscopes had never been operated until a few years ago. Exposure rates at the fluoroscope panel and first half-value layers were determined for various peak kilovoltages and added aluminum filtrations. The experimental data are tabulated in Table V and presented in Fig. 1. The kilovoltages listed were measured using a sphere gap having 3.5-in. spheres, and the milliampere readings were checked for accuracy. Under similar operating conditions and at given kilovoltages and filtrations, all three systems provided essentially identical exposure rates. From personal experience [E.D.T.), it is known that all fluoroscopes of this period used a 12- to 13-in. (30.5- to 33.0-cm) distance from the tube focal spot to the panel. Shorter distances could not be used since the high-voltage terminals were exposed and shorter distances would have led to arcing to the supporting structure. The 5-30 tube, later called the RB tube, was used in a lightproof lead glass shield. When the so-called autoprotective tube, the XP, became available, it was used because it provided better X-ray shielding. A mounted cone was provided that placed the focal spot at the same distance from the panel as was the case with the RB tube. The RB tube, when operated on self-rectified equipment, could be operated continuously at 85 kVp and 5 mA for 6 min in any 36-min interval. Operation at lower kilovoltages would permit slightly longer operating times; however, long exposures were impossible as they would permanently damage the fluoroscopy tube. Table V and Fig. 1 can be used to determine patient exposure if operating conditions are known. For example, if a fluoroscope were operated with no added filtration at 75 kVp and 5 mA for an average exposure time of 15 sec, the patient entrance skin exposure measured free-in-air would be (10.2 R/mA-min) (5 mA) (0.25 min) = 12.75 R. A fluoroscope used to monitor the lung collapse of the Massachusetts women in this study was also located in a private physician's office. Exposure rates determined for various machine settings were within 6% agreement with the controlled fluoroscopic measurements made in the laboratory. The exposure measurements were summarized into average conditions for each of two time periods to be consistent with fluoroscopic practice before and after 377</page><page sequence="6">BOICE, ROSENSTEIN, AND TROUT TABLE V Exposure Rate at Panel, First HVL, and Kilovolt Peaks for Selected Autotransformer Settings and Added Aluminum Filtrationa Autotrans- kVp Added filter First HVL Exposure rate former (mm Al) (mm Al) setting R/min R/mA-min 58 63 68 75 85 0 0.5 1.0 2.0 3.0 0 0.5 1.0 2.0 3.0 0 0.5 1.0 2.0 3.0 0 0.5 1.0 2.0 3.0 0 0.5 1.0 2.0 3.0 0.7 1.05 1.3 1.65 2.0 0.75 1.15 1.4 1.75 2.15 0.8 1.15 1.5 1.8 2.35 0.9 1.25 1.55 2.0 2.45 1.0 1.4 1.7 2.2 2.75 a General Electric Vertical Fluoroscope 5 mA, (8 X 10)-in. field at panel. 1948 (Table VI).

A panel exposure rate of 24.1 R/min was assigned for a 1-mm added aluminum-filtered beam for all patients receiving fluoroscopies during and after 1948. Absorbed Dose in the Breast Estimates of absorbed dose in the breast were derived from a Monte Carlo radiation transport technique, a method that simulates and records the energy deposition of X-ray photons as they undergo physical interactions in an anthro- pomorphic phantom (9).

The initial energies of the X-ray photons used during air collapse fluoroscopies were less than 100 keV. The anthropomorphic phantom represents a reference human and is hetero- geneous. It consists of skeletal, lung, and tissue regions with corresponding compositions and densities. The important human organs are mathematically formulated within the phantom and are the interaction sites of interest. Energy depositions are accumulated at these sites. The average absorbed dose in the organ of interest is obtained directly by dividing the accumulated energy by the mass of the organ. For the present study, the phantom was modified to include the female breasts as described below. X-ray spectral distributions representing the beam qualities of interest were also employed as well as exposure geometries used during the fluoroscopy examinations. The details of the Monte Carlo technique and the phantom, as applied generally with diagnostic X-ray photon energies, have been previously described (9). Two categories of patient breast size were modeled in the anthropomorphic phantom, an adolescent and an adult. The shape of the breast was simulated by TABLE VI Fluoroscopy Conditions Selected to Be Consistent with Pneumotherapy Practices Beam quality 75 kVp X-Ray tube current 5 mA Tube-to-panel distance 33 cm Exposure rate at panel Before 1948, unfiltered beam (HVL = 0.9 mm Al) 51.2 R/min After 1948, 1 mm aluminum added filtration (HVL = 1.55 mm Al) 24.1 R/min 379</page><page sequence="8">BOICE, ROSENSTEIN, AND TROUT one-half an ellipsoid of revolution attached to the chest wall of the existing phantom with the following dimensions: adolescent breast, 3-cm distance from chest wall to nipple and 3.75-cm diameter at the chest wall, 22.3 g each; adult breast, 6-cm distance from chest wall to nipple and 7.5-cm diameter at the chest wall, 179 g each. The remainder of the phantom serves as a backscattering medium in the AP orientation and as a shielding medium (20 cm thick) in the PA orientation. The composition of all breasts was that of average glandular tissue: 10.5% hydrogen, 23.0% carbon, 2.3% nitrogen, 63.2% oxygen, and various smaller percentages of other trace elements (9). As a result of physician interviews and the relatively young age of most patients, it was decided that these assump- tions were consistent with the observation that patients with sufficiently serious tuberculosis to require pneumothorax therapy were generally thin and deficient in both subcutaneous and mammary fat. If the composition of breast were assumed to include a proportion of mammary fat (e.g., 50% adipose and 50% glandular), the resulting decrease in absorbed dose would be less than 15% for all conditions. To simulate the beam qualities selected as representative of patient treatment (Table VI), X-ray spectra were measured on laboratory X-ray sources using germanium detectors (10). The kilovolt peak and HVL values were matched with those in Table VI, resulting in the X-ray spectra tabulated in Table VII. The absorbed dose (rad) in the breast per 1 R of entrance skin exposure (free-in-air) was calculated for each breast for 16 selected exposure situations (Table VIII).6 The absorbed dose in the breast is defined as the total energy deposited in the breast volume divided by the total breast mass. These 16 selected exposure situations (Table VIII) take into account the following factors: (1) 2 beam qualities (Table VI); (2) 2 patient orientations (AP, radiation incident on the anterior skin surface, or PA, radiation incident on the posterior skin surface); (3) 2 breast sizes (adult or adolescent), and (4) 4 X-ray field sizes and locations (Table IV). For example, an adult woman facing the X-ray tube (AP) before 1948 (un- filtered, 0.9 mm Al HVL beam) would receive a right-breast dose of 0.412 rad and a left-breast dose of 0.005 rad for each 1 R of entrance skin exposure if the physician shuttered the X-ray beam during a right-lung pneumothorax fluoroscopy. 6 Recent experimental measurements (13) of absorbed dose in the breast utilizing an Alderson- Rando phantom, Mix-D breast simulations (as described above) and multiple locations of lithium fluoride dosimeters (TLD-100) are in good agreement with the Monte Carlo computed breast dose values. The X-ray beam qualities, geometries, and exposure conditions were maintained constant for both the experiment and computations. For the AP view, in which the breast is directly exposed, the absorbed dose is about 0.5 rad/R and agreement was within 2%. As the AP view is the overwhelming contributor of breast dose, this comparison is the most meaningful. For the PA view, in which the X rays are attenuated by 20 cm of intervening inhomogeneous tissues, the absorbed dose is about 0.02 rad/R and agreement was poorer (20 to 50%). In the light of experimental and computational uncertainties involved with the reduced dose from a PA view and also the differences in the composition of the experimental and mathematical phantoms, the discrepancy is not surprising. Regardless, the PA view contributes only a small fraction of the total breast dose among those patients fluoroscopically examined, and the effect of such a difference is minimal. 380</page><page sequence="9">BREAST CANCER FOLLOWING X-RAY EXPOSURE TABLE VII X-Ray Spectra Used in Absorbed Dose Calculation Photon energy Relative number of photonsa (keV) 75 kVp, 0.9 mm Al HVL 75 kVp, 1.55 mm Al HVL 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 38 40 42 44 46 48 50 52 54 56 58 60 62 64 66 68 70 72 74 0.0002 0.0650 0.1498 0.3093 0.5647 0.7705 0.8989 0.9810 1.0000 0.9907 0.9492 0.8986 0.8435 0.7893 0.7292 0.6704 0.6226 0.5704 0.5165 0.4707 0.4303 0.3922 0.3512 0.3169 0.2822 0.2741 0.2423 0.1891 0.1610 0.1351 0.1144 0.0764 0.0468 0.0100 0.0026 0.0099 0.0294 0.0812 0.2053 0.3949 0.5788 0.7509 0.8750 0.9558 1.0000 0.9989 0.9896 0.9599 0.9227 0 8701 0.8163 0.7641 0.7038 0.6441 0.5919 0.5396 0.4897 0.4439 0.3959 0.3581 0.3199 0.2557 0.2065 0.1702 0.1250 0.0701 0.0274 0.0075 a Normalized to 1 photon at peak energy.

Examinations before 1948 were assigned exposure rates and absorbed doses for an unfiltered beam; fluoroscopies during and after 1948 were assigned corresponding values for a filtered beam (Table VI). The field size was determined by the type of examination (Table IV). Except for the few questionnaire respondents who recalled their orientation with respect to the fluoroscopy X-ray source, individual orientations could not be determined.

During a unilateral lung collapse, both breasts were assumed to be in the X-ray beam 81% of the time (unshuttered) (Table III), whereas 19% of the time only one breast was assumed exposed (shuttered). In the latter case, average breast doses were computed by adding the dose received by the exposed breast and the scatter dose received by the opposite breast and dividing by 2. For the few cases in which both lungs were collapsed (bilateral), both breasts were exposed 100% of the time during fluoroscopy. The average time for a fluoroscopy examination was assumed to be 15 sec. If an adult woman had received 10 pneumothorax examinations before 1948, her estimated cumulative breast dose would be computed as: [(10 exams) (51.2 R/min)(0.25 min/exam) {0.81 0.25(0.482 rad/R) + 0.75(0.017 rad/R)] + 0.19[0.25(0.412 + 0.005 rad/R)/2 + 0.75(0.015 + 0.002 rad/R)/2]} = 15.2 rad. It should be noted that "average" breast doses were computed for each individual on the basis of the best estimates of average orientation and average fluoroscopy practices obtained through patient and physician enquiry. As individual breast doses could be estimated for only a small number of patients, it was decided to compute average doses for all individuals. Initially an attempt was made to utilize individually identifiable information but it was unsuccessful. Many of the 269 patients with presumed known orientation were treated by physicians who had died, and therefore fluoroscopy information was unattainable. It was also common for patients institutionalized for many years to have been treated by several physicians, not all of whom were interviewed. Coupled with the obvious difficulty in relying on individual patient and physician memories of 20 to 45 yr ago, it seemed prudent to use the "average" values of all patient and physician responses for estimating breast doses for all patients.

No decrease in risk at high doses (574 rad) is apparent, and a dose-response relationship that increases linearly or otherwise continuously with increasing dose is not inconsistent with the data [X12(trend) = 7.6, P = 0.003]. The confidence limits are wide, however, and other patterns are possible. (Figure 3 differs somewhat from a previously pub- lished dose-response curve (8) in that incidence rates of the "nonexposed" tuberculosis patients are used as the standard instead of Connecticut Tumor Registry rates.) Risk Estimate A single fluoroscopic examination was estimated to result in an average absorbed dose to the breast of 1.5 rad, and each individual received an estimated cumulative breast dose of approximately 150 rad on the average. The Massa- chusetts women in this study, living 10 yr or more since first fluoroscopic exposure, are estimated to have a breast cancer risk of 6.2 radiation-induced breast cancer cases per million woman-year-rad, with 90% Poisson confidence limits of 2.8 and 10.7 cancers/106 WY-rad (Table X). It is important to examine each assumption made in deriving the above risk TABLE X Average Breast Doses and Resulting Risk Estimates as a Function of the Assumptions Regarding Fluoroscopic Practice Assumption Estimated average Risk estimateb breast dose per CA/106 WY-rad subject (rad) Best estimatea 149 6.2 Breast size Adolescent (3 cm) 208 4.5 Adult (6 cm) 136 6.8 Aluminum beam filtration Inherent only 166 5.6 1 mm added 90 10.3 X-Ray field size Unshuttered 167 5.5 Shuttered 75 12.4 Time for exam (sec) 20 199 4.7 10 100 9.3 5 50 18.5 Patient orientation (% facing X-ray tube) 100 543 1.7 30 175 5.3 20 123 7.5 0 18 51.5 a Assumption: Adolescent breast size for those under 17 yr of age at first exposure; 1 mm Al added in 1948; 81% of the exams performed unshuttered; 15-sec exam time; 25% of the exams performed with patients facing the X-ray tube. b Computed as (0- E)/{(WY) (dose) , i.e., (38 - 20.85)/{ (18, 511) (estimated dose).

Table X lists the average breast doses and resulting risk estimates as a function of the various assumptions regarding fluoroscopic practice. If the total population of exposed women had breast sizes equivalent to the "adolescent size," the average breast dose would be higher, 208 rad, and the risk estimate lower, 4.5/106 WY-rad. Different assump- tions regarding X-ray field size, examination time, or patient orientation would also have an appreciable effect on the breast dose estimate and risk estimate. If a 10- or 20-sec average exposure time were assumed instead of 15 sec, the absolute risk estimates would have been 9.3 and 4.7 cases/106 WY-rad, respec- tively. In addition to exposure time, another critical determinant of breast dose would be whether the patient faced the X-ray tube and received direct breast irradiation or whether she faced the physician. If the patients were assumed to have been fluoroscoped 20 or 30% of the time facing the X-ray tube, instead of 25%, the absolute excess risk estimates would be 7.5 and 5.3 cancers/106 WY-rad, respectively. Considering all the factors contributing to radiation dose, the risk estimate for the women in this study is probably between 3 and 11 excess breast cancers per 106 WY-rad. The contribution to breast dose of multiple radiographic chest X-ray examina- tions was not included in the risk calculations because the resulting dose was so small. Entrance exposure measured free-in-air was 185 mR for the following typical exposure conditions: 73 kVp, 100 mA, 1-sec exposure, 72-in. (183-cm) focal spot-to-film distance, no added filtration, HVL = 0.9 mm Al. For one PA chest X-ray the resulting breast dose was calculated to be 0.008 rad. For the woman exposed to repeated fluoroscopic examinations, the average number of chest X-ray examinations (49) would contribute only 0.4 rad to their estimated cumulative breast dose of 150 rad. DISCUSSION Previous estimates of cumulative breast dose from pneumothorax fluoroscopy have been crude and have resulted in questionable breast cancer risk estimates (1).7 The methodology presented in this report has attempted to improve the estimation of fluoroscopic breast doses by combining information from physician interview, patient questionnaire response; and machine exposure measurements with an absorbed dose computation. Allowing for the assumptions concerning actual fluoroscopic conditions to vary, the best estimate of excess breast cancer absolute risk (6.2 cases/106 WY-rad) is likely to be accurate within sampling variation (3 to 11 cases/106 WY-rad). The breast cancer risk estimates presented, however, were made assuming no uncertainty in the estimated cumulative breast dose. This is a tenuous assumption because of the difficulty in retrospectively estimating fluoroscopy procedures and doses, and the risk estimates obtained should be interpreted with some caution. 7Breast doses from pneumothorax fluoroscopies have also been recently estimated for two fluoroscopes used in the 1940s in Canada. A chipboard phantom and TLD dosimeters were employed and depth-dose curves were determined. The number of tuberculosis patients studied was small, however, and no excess breast cancers were observed and no risk estimates were determined (14). 386</page><page sequence="15">BREAST CANCER FOLLOWING X-RAY EXPOSURE Similarly, the estimated average breast dose per fluoroscopic examination was calculated by adding the doses received by both breasts and dividing by 2. This concept of average dose to the total organ system has been used in two previous human studies (5, 11). Nevertheless, the concept may be questioned, particularly when the breasts are unevenly or partially irradiated. In addition, if the distribution of radiosensitive tissue in the breast is not uniform, computing the radiation dose using total breast volume may not be the most appropriate approach. No other method of estimating breast dose, however, was deemed practical. Table XI compares the findings of the current Massachusetts fluoroscopy study with the three previously mentioned studies. The risk estimate for the Massa- chusetts tuberculosis patients is comparable with the two studies of Western women but about three times larger than the estimate from the Japanese popula- tion exposed to atomic radiation. One explanation is a variation in genetic susceptibility. Alternative explanations for this difference might be that the Japanese risk estimate is diluted because of the inclusion of the low-risk post- exposure years 5 to 9 in the risk computation. Because the Japanese study has a maximum period of observation of 25 yr, it is also possible that the risk estimate will increase with the passage of time, as suggested in the current study (8). These two factors alone could possibly explain the difference in risk estimates. If the risk estimate for the Massachusetts women in our study were calculated considering only years 5 to 24 of followup, the absolute risk estimate would have been 3.1 cases/106 WY-rad, in close agreement with the Japanese estimate of 2.5 cases/106 WY-rad. The Western studies also involved populations of women whose mean ages at first exposure were 7-9 yr younger than the Japanese women. If age at exposure is inversely related to breast cancer risk (8), the older atomic bomb victims may in fact be at lower risk. The Japanese women also received "whole-body" radiation exposure, and if the resulting ovarian irradiation had a protective effect on breast cancer development, the risk estimate obtained would be lower than the estimate from those studies involving partial-body irradiation. In studies of women undergoing radiation castration (12), significant decreases in death due to breast cancer have been observed that could be attributable to ovarian irradiation.8 Although the absolute risk estimate derived from our study of Massachusetts fluoroscopy patients can be supported with some confidence, a number of dose- response relationships could be consistent with the data. The variation of breast cancer incidence rate by the number of fluoroscopic examinations suggests a falloff of risk at the higher cumulative doses. In the Nova Scotia fluoroscopy study, no falloff was seen and breast cancer incidence increased with increasing numbers of fluoroscopic examinations up through the maximum average number of 450 (1). No falloff was observed in the present study either, when the breast cancer incidence rate was expressed as a function of cumulative patient breast dose (rad) rather than the number of fluoroscopic examinations. Conversion to cumulative breast dose included the effect of important variables such as orienta- 8 In animal studies, however, mammary neoplasia can be increased when only the ovaries of mice are irradiated (15); whereas, no effect on mammary neoplastic development attributable to ovarian irradiation is apparent following "whole-body" radiation exposure of rats (16). 387</page><page sequence="16">TABLE XI Risk Estimates for Breast Cancer Induction by Radiation and Comparisons with Other Studies Number Woman-years Type of Duration of Age at Breast Time after Relative Cancers irradiated used for risk radiation exposure exposure dose irrad. on risk induced calculation range in rad which risk (O/E) per 106 (mean) range estimates WY-rad (mean) are based (90% CL) (years) Atomic bomb 11,968 235,345 Gamma ray and Less than 10+ 10-450 5-24 82/48.5 2.5 survivorsa neutron 10 sec (34) (61) =1.7 (1.3, 3.6) (1, 3, 4) Nova Scotia 243 3,708 Diagnostic X ray, Weeks to 0-60+ 50-7,000 10-30 10.5 8.4b fluoroscopy 70-85 kVp years (26) (1215) series (1, 6) Mastitis 606 9,301 Therapeutic X ray, Minutes to 15-44 40-1,200 10-34 36/16.2 8.3 patients 175-250 kVp weeks (27) (247) =2.2 (3.1, 16.0) (1, 5, 12) Current 1,047 18,511 Diagnostic X ray, Days to 5-55 1-1,027 10-44 38/20.9 6.2 Massachusetts 70-85 kVp years (25) (150) =1.8 (2.8, 10.7) fluoroscopy study a Women over 10 yr of age at irradiation who received greater than 9 rad of breast kerma dose. b Confidence limits (CL) cannot be calculated. co oo o0 tz C 0 C z z IIt H C H til .14 14</page><page sequence="17">BREAST CANCER FOLLOWING X-RAY EXPOSURE tion, beam filtration, and type of examination. The sample size and the associated confidence limits on the breast cancer incidence rates are such that dose-response functions other than linear could be compatible with the data. Although no clear-cut dose-response function is evident, the data are consistent with linearity and it appears prudent to assume a linear relationship for the purpose of radiation protection and public health considerations (1). When comparing the exposed patients with the comparison patients and adjusting for age at exposure and duration of followup (Table IX), it is interesting that a risk associated with breast doses under 100 rad is suggested: The standard- ized incidence rate of breast cancer among those receiving an average of 32 rad is 109/105 versus 79/105 WY for the comparison patients. This increase, however, is not statistically significant (P = 0.47, 1 tail). When Connecticut incidence rates are used to compute expected breast cancer cases (Table IX), no excess breast cancer is apparent among those receiving less than 100 rad (10 cancers observed and 9.6 expected). These data, however, should not be interpreted to mean that there is no risk for breast cancer induction at these dose levels. The sample size of 469 women and the average breast dose of 32 rad may have been too small to detect a statistically significant increased risk. On the basis of a risk estimate of 6.2 cancers/106 WY-rad, an excess of 1.4 radiogenic breast cancers would have been expected for these 469 women. There is no statistically significant difference between the observed 10 cases and the predicted (9.6 + 1.4) = 11 cancers based on the radiation risk estimate. Data from the previous fluoroscopy study of Nova Scotia tuberculosis patients were consistent with a linear dose-response relationship between breast cancer incidence and high total breast doses attained from many individual low-dose fractions (1). Because all the Nova Scotia women faced the X-ray tube during fluoroscopy examination, the cumulative breast doses were great, averaging 1215 rad. The range of cumulative breast doses for the Massachusetts patients in our study (150-rad average), however, is approximately one magnitude lower than that for the Nova Scotia series. The results of the two studies, with regard to the shape of the dose-response curve and the computed breast cancer risk estimates, are compatible. This suggests that for low-dose fractionated exposures, the breast cancer risk per rad is similar over a wide range of total cumulative doses. The fluoroscopy studies also present overall radiation risk estimates that are similar to those derived from studies involving single or few radiation exposures (2-5). The repeated fluoroscopic exposures, however, were delivered over a period of years, allowing cellular repair and repopulation to occur. Since these multiple low-dose exposures might be expected to produce fewer deleterious effects than a single exposure of the same total dose (1), the fact that they do not suggests that the radiation damage is cumulative. When assessing the possible radiation risk associated with repeated low-dose mammography exposures, it appears prudent to assume that the risk is present at the low dose levels involved and that the total risk will be proportional to the total radiation dose received during the lifetimes of the women exposed. 389</page><page sequence="18">BOICE, ROSENSTEIN, AND TROUT ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors acknowledge the contributions of John W.
