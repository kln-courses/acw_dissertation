KATZ Reed College, 3203 SE Woodstock Boulevard, Portland, OR, 97202-8199, USA E-mail: katzda @ reed, edu Abstract On 29 March 1516 the Venetian Senate ordered all Jews residing in the city to move behind the walls of the ghetto. The mandate stipulated that Jews would be watched by Christian guards twenty-four hours a day and restricted by a nighttime curfew. In such a sur- veilled space, Venice's ghetto windows played an integral role in the complex and interactive networks constituting the city and its constituency. The singular status of ghetto architecture - especially the injunctions regarding its fenestration - provides an opportunity to explore the processes of ghettoization that partitioned a population and monitored the activities of Jews and Christians alike. Windows produced spatial occasions for looking and being looked at that reinforced social difference and created profound cultural fissures. This article studies the windows of the Venetian ghetto and the city's ongoing claims to obstruct them in the early modern period. To study the window is to study the demarcation between public good and private plurality, between the citizen and the subordinated Other. In William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, Shylock personifies the greed of the archetypal Jew whose usurious practices perhaps attract money- seeking Christians but also repel his own flesh and blood, his daughter Jes- sica. Shylock instructs his beloved daughter to "look to my house" (II.v.16) while he is away fleshing out, as it were, the terms of a future bond. Despite the Jew's command to look after his house in his absence, he warns Jessica not to look out from it. In particular, Shylock urges her not to take in the views from the windows: Hear you me, Jessica: Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum I am grateful for support provided by the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, the Michael E. and Carol S. Levine Foundation, the Renaissance Society of America, the Memorial Foun- dation for Jewish Culture, and Reed College.

KATZ And the vile squealing of the wry-necked fife, Clamber not you up to the casements then, Nor thrust your head into the public street To gaze on Christian fools with varnished faces; But stop my house's ears - I mean my casements (II.v.28-34) Both Shylock's house and the restricted views from it are architectonic sig- nifiers of property. Shylock here seeks not only to protect his home and the wealth it houses through bolted doors, but also to safeguard his personal as- set, the vulnerable Jessica, from the dangerous views of the Christian world from his casements. In this Shakespearean scene the varnished physiognomy of Christian revelry is made conspicuous from Shylock's casement, the con- cealing properties of the Venetian mask enhancing the transparency of the window. Windows produced anxiety in early modern Europe precisely because they punctured the stability and closure of the wall. The window perforated the architectural integrity of concealment, exposing the permeability of place. That Jessica would forsake her father is foreshadowed architecturally through the window. Immediately following Shylock's directive to seal his house, the outspoken servant Lancelot Gobbo whispers into Jessica's ear: Mistress, look out at window for all this: There will come a Christian by Will be worth a Jewès eye (II.v.40-42) Jessica's abandonment of her father and conversion to Christianity is marked at that window. The contested site of the casement in Shakespeare's verse engenders a new form of spatial relations that challenged the infrastructure of social acceptability. To situate a "beautiful Jewess" at a window was to transcend the threshold of respectable behavior, to give public accessibility to the socially marginal. Jessica's invitation to enjoy the window vistas was particularly fraught, given her gender and religious difference. Lisa Lampert, in her literary study of the hermeneutics of such difference, writes, "The bifurcated representa- tions of woman and Jew. . . reflect the uneasy figurations of women and Jews as both insiders and outsiders of Christian society."1 Jessica brings together these two constructed categories, woman and Jew, creating a dual layer of alienation. Her conversion to Christianity could not mitigate her marginal- ization, as she herself repeatedly questions her capability to "escape a Jewish essence."2 Yet, to call her to the window before that conversion was even complete was to challenge the essentialist claims of her Jewishness and her gender.3 The window, a liminal space joining the interior of a building with its exterior, provided Jessica with an agency that neither women nor Jews, and certainly not its aggregate Jewess, historically possessed.</page><page sequence="3">CLAMBER NOT YOU UP TO THE CASEMENTS 1 29 Jessica's casement may not have previously elicited scholarly attention, but Shakespeare's sensitivity to the window is celebrated on a Veronese ve- randa in Romeo and Juliet, Whereas Juliet encounters her fair Romeo at the balcony overlooking a private enclosed garden, Jessica's window view of Christian revelers is distinctly public and specifically prohibited.4 In The Merchant of Venice, it is the windowscape that proved precarious for both Christians and Jews. Windows produce spatial occasions for looking and be- ing looked at that reinforced social difference and created profound cultural fissures.5 That is, windows pierce walls, thereby producing a privileged gaze onto the spaces of the street that transgressed the boundary between public and private. As John Ruskin writes in his mid-nineteenth-century The Stones of Venice, "It is the approachability of the window, that is to say, the anni- hilation of the thickness of the wall, which is the real point to be attended to."6 In this article, I seek to attend to the early modern window and other building apertures both formally as applied to architecture and ideologically as associated with views and viewing.7 Though interested specifically in the fenestral designs and representations of Venice, this article takes an excur- sion, if only briefly, to early modern London. The preoccupation with the Other in The Merchant of Venice, dramatized by characters such as Shylock and Jessica, draws Shakespeare's London into a compelling comparative with Venice. Both cities attracted a growing foreign presence as a result of their interests in commercial trade. Both cities categorized community based on the participatory involvement of its citizenry that distinguished the incorpo- rated from the cities' disenfranchised aliens. Civic community in London and Venice was predicated on genealogy and residence that promoted spaces for differentiation and subordination. The spatial practices conjoining social marginality and geographic propinquity in these two urban centers orient us to the window, where gazes crossed. The window played an integral role in the activities, processes, and relations constituting the city and its con- stituency, functioning both as mediator of and barrier to the animated scenes of urban life. The looking glass of the early modern casement symbolized the cities' collective body to articulate the power and social controls delineating the physiognomies of community. To study the window is to study the de- marcation between public good and private plurality, between the citizen and the subordinated Other. Injurious London Early modern architectural treatises grant the window a prime position in the anatomy of design. Italian Renaissance humanist Leon Battista Alberti writes in De re aedificatoria of c. 1452 that windows were required of any</page><page sequence="4">130 DANA E. KATZ edifice for proper ventilation and illumination.8 Alberti, whose architectural authority held sway over construction projects in early modern Europe and beyond, insists that "every part of the house should have a window to allow the air within to breathe and be regularly renewed, otherwise it will decay and become stale."9 The health of a building was shaped by its windows as well as governed by their placement, size, and number. Alberti turns to the lessons of classical antiquity and the writings of Ammianus Marcellinus to provide a cautionary tale for contemporary construction. During the time of Marc Anthony, Alberti recounts, soldiers plundered Seleucia and brought its spoils, including the temple statue, to Rome. Before their departure, Roman footmen discovered a narrow opening in the temple previously sealed off by Chaldean priests. They ordered the space opened, which released "an infec- tious vapor. . .so offensive and detestable that from Persia to Gaul everything was infested with loathsome and fatal disease."10 Early modern architects respected the functional requirements of the window. Puncturing the surface of the wall was the only way to ensure adequate aeration. The window, re- gardless of its formal arrangements or aesthetic flourishes, was structurally necessary to protect those living within the building and without from the dangers of total enclosure. Admitting light also presented practical and aesthetic requirements for all buildings and all chambers constituting those buildings. The classical archi- tect and writer Vitruvius notes in De architectura that the washbasin in a palaestra must be situated under a window so as not to obstruct the flow of light from the shadows cast from those who come to enjoy the baths. 1 ] Re- naissance theorists repeated Vitruvius's attention to interior illumination. For Alberti, doors, stairwells, and colonnades permitted objects to pass through a building; "windows serve for light." The utility of a given room depended upon the amount of lighting that room received. Reception chambers, for example, may require more light than a private bedchamber; nevertheless, the location of the windows on the wall remained approximately equivalent. On window placement Alberti specifies that, "any opening intended to admit light should also allow a view out to the sky, and any windows constructed for this purpose ought never to be given a low position: light is seen by the face, not by the feet."12 Consider the theoretically compelling pragmatics of this Albertian instruction. Alberti advises that windows must be situated at eye- level to allow the room to maximize the benefits of the sun's rays. He warns that to position the openings too low is to throw the room into darkness. This method of locating windows permits sufficient illumination through the placement of wall apertures set to the "view out to the sky." Fenestration in early modern architectural treatises thus treats the lighting of the room with consideration to the views outside it. To "receive the direct sun" as Alberti</page><page sequence="5">CLAMBER NOT YOU UP TO THE CASEMENTS 1 3 1 prescribes, window apertures must engage the eyes of the building's inhab- itants. In other words, to allow the sun in, residents must be able to look out. This theoretical position noted textually in treatises of the period is further complicated in coeval practice. In late medieval and early modern London, for instance, residents sought adjudication to defend the light and air of their homes from obstruction. When a building project encroached on neighbor- ing windows, the London Assize of Nuisance, a juridical body consisting of municipal leaders and construction specialists, rendered judgment to pro- tect the health and beauty of the city.13 In a case involving Master Hales and his neighbor (identified as J. S.), local attorneys in 1636 maintained that impediments to the efficacy of the plaintiff's window constituted a civic nui- sance that required immediate redress. As Master Christopher Wray involved in the case argued, "For when this light and air are taken from him [Mas- ter Hales], his house remaineth as a dungeon."14 The case of Hales versus J. S. presents the window as essential to the private liberties of London's cit- izenry. Lawyers argued that blocking the window was "altogether unlawful and unreasonable" since it put the aggrieved resident in a condition of con- finement. Window obstruction was a form of internment that could not be tolerated as it jeopardized the well-being of citizens and brought dishonor to the city. Such disrespect of the city also took the form of physical damage to London's windows. The meanings and motives were manifold. For exam- ple, Anne Barber in 1610 shattered the windows at Emma Bacchus's home in condemnation of Bacchus's lascivious comportment and cuckoldry. Bac- chus was labeled "a bawd. . .and thow diddest breake thy glasse windowes because thow wouldest have thy house knowne to be a whore house."15 Bro- ken windows, a scandalous signifier of a bawdy home, were associated with all that was salacious and immoral. Protecting the home from this architec- tural language of insult required overseeing all impaired windows as well as the light and air passing through them. Londoners refused to allow their private homes to become a conspicuous symbol of public scorn or private confinement.16 The sight of London's freedom, according to case law, issued forth architecturally from its windows. As window obstruction evoked fears of infirmity and incarceration linked to a larger culture of civic dishonor, so the shattering of windowpanes evolved as a ritualized form of violence that avenged assaults against the city and cit- izenry. Renzo Dubbini writes, "In the opposition that it sets up between so- cial space and the individual microcosm, between mobility and immobility, the window remained a dual and contradictory shape."17 The oppositional interrelatedness of the interior and exterior worlds framed by the window lays claim to its civic complexities. The window in the urban context was especially vulnerable, exposed to the diverse elements of its constructed so- ciopolitical milieu. Such vulnerability distinguishes urban space from natural</page><page sequence="6">132 DANA E. KATZ space in that the conditions constituting the London metropolis do not cor- relate to life in the English country house. The casements of the English lodge, situated in the depths of the forest, produced verdant views of the gen- try, as that of the villa, built in "the Subburbes of the Cittie, because. . .the place is healthy, and through the distance from the bodye of the Towne, the noy se not much," offered the pleasant tranquility of the countryside.18 The city window, on the contrary, surveyed the structure and order that joined the disparate and interactive networks of urbanity. Its prominence of position at the threshold of social practice and exchange induced citizens and their gov- erning agencies to act promptly to rectify inconveniences or improprieties at the window. Window obstruction or destruction was a socially coded form of civil disorder that repeatedly provoked the administrative concerns of local authorities. Complaints filed with the London Assize of Nuisance confirm how emo- tions ran high when the integrity of the window was compromised. Offenses committed among neighbors led the Assize to pronounce verdicts related to the sensory encroachment of smells, sounds, and sights (or at times the lack thereof) afflicting citizens in their own homes. As Diane Shaw explains in her research on the Assize, the conception of the neighbor in densely populated London identified more than the next-door resident. The neigh- bor performed a vital role in the production of space by delineating bound- aries and constituting borders. Shaw structures her definition of the Eng- lish neighbor around the fault lines of urban planning, where the category "neighbor" demarcated the fixed land boundaries of personal property. She emphasizes that "size and location [of such property] were presented not in terms of independent physical measurement, but in the social nomenclature of neighborly proxemics."19 In this example, the physical outlines of an in- dividual Londoner's real estate was measured socially through the identity of those who lived on its borders. Such borders delimiting the places of pri- vate life also represented the categorical exclusions essential to a cohesive community.20 Arbitration on the emissions of light, air, sound, or even privy odors through windows or other architectural openings were important to the city because they distinguished the contours of private space through the invasion of that space, as Shaw aptly notes. However, windows also crys- tallized the community at large by providing a totalizing image of the city. The window meditated the level of civilization from within a building and the exhibited decorousness seen from without. It filtered dialogues of reci- procity and exchange through its symbolically-charged panes of glass to re- veal fragmentary vignettes of the community's collected body. To barricade a window was to identify the outsiders living within city limits, to create the conditions of an internal urban exile that spatially marked the city's alter- ity.</page><page sequence="7">CLAMBER NOT YOU UP TO THE CASEMENTS 1 33 This was no metaphorical division, since Elizabethan London regu- lated alien subjects through architectural restrictions. Refugees, particularly Protestant brethren from the Low Countries and elsewhere, received the city's protection from religious persecution, but they were denied the right to eco- nomic freedom. Their status as a "community of strangers" excluded them during Henry VIIFs reign from owning, inheriting, or leasing property and from opening and maintaining a shop. While in 1556, London's Chamber- lain closed off the shop windows of aliens visible from the public street with concealing latticework, later attempts to prevent consumers from purchas- ing foreign-made goods required modifications to the architecture itself. The Crown under Elizabeth permitted aliens their shops in 1587, on condition that passersby could neither see nor purchase the strangers' wares from store windows or doors. Shop apertures were to be "made in such sort as peo- ple passing by may not see them [the aliens] at work, and so as their wares and merchandizes. . .give no open show to any people passing by."21 Such windows, nevertheless, must "leave convenient light for them to work."22 To deny the transparency of the window was to curtail the economic potential of the foreign worker and to remove him as competition in the English market- place. Elizabethan London permitted aliens their windows for the transmis- sion of light but disallowed them direct access to English consumption and consumerism and, therefore, to profit. Plural Venice If London measured community by the appellation of its citizens, Venice then defined itself against the resident aliens in its midst. If London mani- fested self-interest by its laws of property that economically disenfranchised foreign Protestants, Venice blocked windows to protect the rights of Chris- tian (i.e., Catholic) citizens from the unwanted views of the Other. The com- munity in Venice was defined spatially by its common belief in Christian- ity, not through the diversity of its parts. To symbolize the polis as Chris- tian, Venetian authorities legislated fenestration constrictions for religious outsiders. Among the urban spaces to exercise window closure was the area known as the ghetto, which housed the Jews of Venice.23 In 1560, the Cinque Savi alla Mercanzia (Board of Trade) required Jews to obstruct their canal- side view outside the newly constructed buildings in the Ghetto Vecchio by walling up windows, balconies, and doors to prevent ocular contact between Jew and Christian. The 1516 legislation that ushered Jews, specifically Ital- ian and German Jewish communities, into the overcrowded quarters of the Ghetto Nuovo, expanded in 1541 with the establishment of the Ghetto Vec- chio (Figs. 1-2). The Collegio, comprised of Venice's doge and twenty-two</page><page sequence="8">134 DANA E. K ATZ Figure 1. (Color online) The Ghetto Nuovo, established in Venice in 1516. Photo: author of its highest-ranking councilors, ruled in July 1541 that the Ghetto Nuovo could not adequately lodge the influx of migrating Levantine Jews because of the complex's restricted space.24 Levantines formerly from Ottoman territo- ries therefore took up residence within the ghetto's growing perimeters. The charters authorizing the Jewish presence in the city permitted Levantine Jews to reside in the newly portioned Ghetto Vecchio but prohibited them from opening shops (far botteghe), including the banks and stores selling second- hand goods (arte di strazzaria) that characterized commerce in the original Ghetto Nuovo. Zoning the mass housing projects of the ghetto complex rep- resented the social stratification of its inhabitants and their economic utility.25 Venetians literally made room in the city for Levantine merchants because of the Jews' economic potential and trade relations with the East.26 The urban residential areas of the Venetian ghetto segregated living quarters by ethnic- ity, class, and trade, at least until the early years of the seventeenth century when Jews began to move more freely between ghetto spaces.27 At its incep- tion in the sixteenth century, the ghetto under Christian stewardship distin- guished where Jews lived through calculations as to how they contributed to Venice's mercantilism and maritime trade. Venetian zoning practices institutionalized the Jewish presence in dis- tinct areas of the ghetto. These residential regulations also determined what</page><page sequence="9">CLAMBER NOT YOU UP TO THE CASEMENTS 1 35 Figure 2. (Color online) The Ghetto Vecchio, established in Venice in 1541 .

On 3 August 1560, the Cinque Savi demanded that the Levantine Jews in the Ghetto Vecchio seal up all windows, balconies, and doors along the Cannaregio because they feared the views from the ghetto's apertures could potentially "incon- venience" neighboring Christians and disturb their "serenity."28 The docu- mented binary of Jew and Christian in this legislation is striking given that Venice was a city in which geographic divisions were continually crossed in demonstration of the unity of the Venetian polity.29 In Venice, rich and</page><page sequence="10">136 DANA E.

Jacopo de' Barbari's bird's-eye view of Venice, exe- cuted in 1500, provides visual expression to the unity of the urban geography (Fig. 3). The synoptic structure of de' Barbari's map presents the harmo- nious totality of the city's contours and, as Bronwen Wilson states, "conveys the Venetian rejection of magnificence, the subordination of the individual to the collective."30 The urban practices that bound Venice's topography also partitioned it. The city's claim to the collective at times clashed with its aggressive commercialism, which permitted outsiders in Venice but moni- tored their actions and interactions. Representing the urban spaces of Venice required delineation and constant observation. As a result, the government posted four guards and two boat patrolmen to keep close watch on the ghet- toized Jews throughout the day and night.31 The social geography of Venice may well have acquired republican meaning from its corporate identity, but challenges to the contiguous contours of the property arose when its margins were populated by the socially marginal. The walling up of architectural apertures in Venice, the contested site of the enclosed window in London - the differences among these urban prac- tices are central to the conception of community. Citizens of late medieval and early modern London denounced window obstruction as a wrongful act that opposed responsible property management and challenged the customs of the city. Since resident aliens in London possessed no legal claims to prop- erty, civil authorities closed shop windows to protect the city's networks of consumption. Domestic windowscapes remained a matter of London's citi- zenry. Damaging a Londoner's window advanced a social discourse of do- mestic impropriety. Yet damaging the views of a Londoner's window was</page><page sequence="11">CLAMBER NOT YOU UP TO THE CASEMENTS 1 37 analogous to subjecting the resident to the noxious stench of a nearby la- trine or eavesdropping on a private conversation from the next-door garden. All these disparate offenses were associated with the neglectful act of the public nuisance.32 The offensive practices performed at London's windows, such as limiting range of sight, introducing fetid smells, or listening in on a neighbor's private conversation, violated the well-being of citizens and their claims to moral rectitude and civic honor. As these examples suggest, neigh- borly negligence in London drew from abuses affecting all the senses. Intru- sions of sights, sounds, and smells were equally injurious, as indicated by the arbitration of the London Assize of Nuisance. The documentary language in contemporary Venice instead gives sensory primacy to sight. Seeing in or looking out evolved as an exercise in power in early modern Venice that motivated the government to station watchmen in restricted areas of the city and to prohibit visual access to Venice to cer- tain members of the city's constituency. The window in Venice provided the venue for an exchange of gazes that proved problematic in buildings housing foreigners. When ordering Jessica away from the alluring sounds of night- time revelry, Shylock in The Merchant of Venice presses her to "stop my house's ears - I mean my casements" (II.v.34).33 Here Shylock insists that the window possesses the anthropomorphic capacity of hearing. Perhaps the Londoner's casement, as indicated by the Assize, enhanced the plaintiff's audition in cases involving the neighborhood complaint of being overheard, but the window in Venice heightened vision. Architectural apertures framed Venice's surveillance system. Gazing on the city's urban form was not nec- essarily wrongful, but in the Venetian context it ignited civic concern that went beyond the boundaries of the neighborhood and exceeded the local- ized encroachments of a nuisance. Given the diverse social forces inhabiting Venice, access to the window transformed from a neighborly pleasure to a state-sanctioned privilege. The archival voice of Venetian authorities, governmental and ecclesiasti- cal, record the attention afforded windows and windowscapes. The window in Venice presented more than a social or economic anxiety, as in London. Rather, the public regarded the Jews' windowscapes as blasphemous. In the ghetto, window access, as we will see, incited government attention when allegations circulated accusing Jews of committing irreverent acts from their casements against Christ, as manifest in the Eucharist, and against Chris- tians, both ecclesiastic and lay. Veiling vision in the ghetto was an arduous task given the dizzying elevation of the buildings atop the scarce ground of the Venetian lagoon (Fig. 4). Beginning in the late fifteenth century, resi- dential buildings in Venice traditionally rose to three or four floors.34 The unprecedented height of the ghetto buildings, soaring with acute perpendicu- larity up to nine stories, yielded extraordinary city sights (Fig. 5).35 If Venice,</page><page sequence="12">138 DANA E.

Archivio di Stato di Venezia, Ufficiali al Cattaver, busta 278. Photo: author, su concessione del Ministero per i Beni e le Attività Culturali, n. 47/2010 In 1560 the Cinque Savi required Jews to obstruct their canal-side view outside the Ghetto Vecchio in order to submit the Jews themselves and their ghetto vistas to regulatory discipline. Defining the forbidden views from the ghetto formed part of Venetian legislation with the establishment of the Ghetto Vecchio in 1541. The Venetian government prohibited the construc- tion of balconies along the walls of the Ghetto Vecchio at Cannaregio un- less iron grates were installed on all the windows.36 This act of fortification, though later rejected, sought literally to bar Jews entry into Christian spaces, for Christians remained on portions of the land adjoining the Ghetto Vecchio. Although the iron grills participated in a project of segregation, they did not preclude visual access to the Christian world, as did the recommendations of 1560. In this later mandate, the Cinque Savi sought not only to close off</page><page sequence="14">140 DANA E. KATZ windows, balconies, doors, quays, and rooftop belvederes called altane, they also requested the erections of new unpunctured walls to ensure complete enclosure.37 Such directives indicate that the Venetian government would not permit the Jews to experience the world outside the ghetto with autonomous eyes. The reciprocity of the urban gaze, the look and the look returned, en- gendered an encroachment of space explicitly identified as Christian that cre- ated an uneasy social instability. The establishment of the ghetto produced a space that visually defined the Jews' "objecthood." Venetian authorities posi- tioned Jews as objects on the periphery for continual observation. Built into this system of surveillance was the potential for Jews to conduct their own act of fenestral looking. This reciprocity of gazes and sight lines provoked social tensions precisely because Jews as objects, controlled and disciplined, transformed with their optical powers into subsidiary subjects. As Beatriz Colomina argues, "Architecture is not simply a platform that accommodates the viewing subject. It is a viewing mechanism that produces the subject. It precedes and frames its occupant."38 The renegotiation of the Jews' visual ac- cess to Christians in the vicinity conveys the Venetian authorities' attempt to define the edges of urban space, to overcome the visual reciprocity, through the occluded views of the ghetto. Displaced within the controlling ghetto walls, the Jews were "caught in the act of seeing, entrapped in the very mo- ment of control" that housed their illicit varieties of viewing.39 The optical interference of the ghetto proved so vexing to its urban sur- roundings that state officials, in an attempt to define better the limits of the neighborhood, built window restrictions into the sequestered quarters of other Others, including Turks. Jews and Turks were the foremost categories of re- ligious difference in Venice; consequently, the confinement of Muslim Ot- toman Turks in the Fondaco dei Turchi in the early seventeenth century fol- lowed the model of Jewish ghettoization from the previous century.40 Situ- ated along the Grand Canal in the parish of San Giacomo dall'Orto, the Fon- daco dei Turchi belonged to the dukes of Ferrara until Venetians repossessed the Byzantine-inspired palace (Fig. 6).41 On 1 1 December 1620, the Collegio charged the Cinque Savi with overseeing the alterations necessary to trans- form the building from a luxurious private palazzo befitting a Renaissance prince to a warehouse and living quarters for itinerant Turkish merchants traveling between the Ottoman Empire and their trading post in Venice. The regulations conceived by the Cinque Savi in May 1621 specified that no Turk could move into the fondaco until all doors on the landward side of the build- ing were walled up, the balconies along the Grand Canal were sealed, and the wall along the Grand Canal where the Turks unload their merchandise was raised another four feet. Additionally, the magistracy indicated that "it shall be made impossible to see into the courtyard of the house [fondaco] from the landward side: either a wall shall be erected to block the view, or else all</page><page sequence="15">CLAMBER NOT YOU UP TO THE CASEMENTS 1 4 1 Figure 6. (Color online) The Fondaco dei Turchi, established in Venice in 1621. Photo: author the windows and openings shall be stopped up, so that the Turks cannot be seen by their neighbors."42 In this example, the fondaco's rules of operation demonstrate how sightlessness was bilateral. Blocked windows, balconies, and doors blinded Turkish merchants from the scenes of Venice, whereas the elevated walls circumscribing the fondaco equally precluded Christian ob- servation of local Turks. Only the Christian guard posted at the fondaco with "twenty-five lamps burning throughout the night" had a cycloptic view of both worlds that endured throughout the day and night.43 To barricade the Turks in the fondaco was to define the limits of the neighborhood. Despite their designated presence in the city, Muslim Ottoman Turks through an enumerated list of house rules architecturally represented a fortified void in the Venetian urban topography. The magistracy of the Cinque Savi curtailed access to the fondaco, both physical and visual, through enclo- sure of the building's apertures and erection of high walls, thereby making the Turks invisible to the eyes of the Christian community. Authorities ap- pointed Venetian guardians to protect the integrity of this out-of-sight pol- icy with penalties ranging from pecuniary to corporal for all transgressors. Venetian urban planning engaged in such a non-neighborly offensive, since authorities feared the presence of Turks, both for their religious difference</page><page sequence="16">142 DANA E. K ATZ and the political puissance of the sultan. As a consequence, Turks remained outsiders within city limits, their residency in the city entailing a condition of internal exile. Dennis Romano writes in the context of Venetian urban- ism that exile was in fact proscriptive: "it tells the victim what he cannot do, but it leaves open a wide range of options."44 Turks had the freedom to leave their bounded strictures during the day to conduct commerce beyond the perimeters of the fondaco. Nevertheless, the private space of their con- finement ensured that most fondaco business was performed out of sight of their Venetian neighbors. The divisions of society inscribed in Venice's urban fabric took archi- tectonic form to define spatially the city's common belief in Christianity.45 While Christians permitted difference to dwell within the city, they simulta- neously required protection from the foreign observers' gaze. At the time of the fondaco's foundation, Venetians covered windowpanes and built conceal- ing walls and other optical obstructions in order to protect Christian privacy from neighboring Turks. In the case of the ghetto, where Jews directed their ocular attention to the world outside its guarded walls, this privacy had been breached. From their ghettoized interiors, the Jews entangled their domestic space with public spectacle and so trespassed on the exterior world belong- ing exclusively to Christians. The ghetto window thus posed a problem for Venetian urbanism, and, as a result, the ghetto required ongoing legislation - even a century after its establishment - to ensure its urban isolation, both within and without. Controlling the Jews' cityscape began at the level of the lagoon and as- cended as high as the clouds. Rive, the private embankments used to transfer merchandise from the canals to the city's buildings, were closed off to Jews to ensure the integrity of their confinement. On 15 January 1629, legislation passed in the Senate that reiterated the sixteenth-century ban on "opening the ghetto rive, in the houses or businesses of particular Jews."46 To uphold the "pristine authority" of the offices charged with overseeing the Jewish com- munities and to avert civic "scandal," magistrates inscribed riva closure in the Jews' charters of residence.47 Authorities occasionally furnished exceptions to the Ghetto Nuovo bankers, whose small loans against pledges of modest value to the Christian impecunious benefited private credit markets and pub- lic finance. Simon di Calimani Banchiere profited from this exemption when the magistracy of the Cattaveri authorized on 27 April 1588 the opening of the riva supplying his two banks, with the appended caveat of a 50-ducat fine if the embankment remained open after sundown.48 Similarly, Nassimben de Calimani on 16 December 1614 received licensed access to his riva from the Council of Ten.49 Officials the previous month had commanded Nassimben to wall up his Ghetto Nuovo riva or submit to significant penalty. The Jew's service to the state, however, inspired the injunction's annulment. Nassimben</page><page sequence="17">CLAMBER NOT YOU UP TO THE CASEMENTS 1 43 de Calimani owned a second-hand goods business that provided the govern- ment with fine tapestries and other luxury items used in civic ceremonies, secular and sacred. Authorities therefore permitted Nassimben his riva but obliged him to lock the quay at night and return its keys to patrolling ghetto guards. Entrepreneurial Jews from the Ghetto Vecchio also retained occa- sional access to rive when moving merchandise. Benjamin Ravid explains that riva contact was conditional, based on records left with ghetto guards that specified the Jewish merchant's name and destination as well as a report redacted by the Jew and submitted to the Cattaveri the following morning to verify his whereabouts.50 Access to architectural apertures solicited a series of legislative checks and balances, reports for rive or licenses paid for rooftop altane, to ensure Christians their controlled surveillance. These scrutinized openings in the ghetto's frail design provided Jews a means of doing business and admitting light in their sequestered spaces. Through regulatory restric- tions, such apertures concomitantly provided Venetians a means of control that guided the sun's rays into the ghetto even as they refracted the city's persistently surveyed image. Balconies too came under scrutiny. On 28 March 1587 the Cinque Savi reinstated legislation requiring bars on all balconies facing Christians in the vicinity.51 In 1604 officials prompted Camilla and Zuane Minotto, the Chris- tian proprietors renting space to Jews in the Ghetto Vecchio, to hasten the in- stallation of iron grills on all "low balconies."52 The Cattaveri issued a warn- ing about such balconies again in 1616, demanding that the Jews in both ghet- tos summarily comply with the legislative mandates to cover up their expo- sure to adjacent Christians. The Jews responded with resistance. Jewish com- munity leaders comprising the self-governing body of the Small Assembly (congrega piccola) recorded their opposition in a translated text now known as the Libro Grande. Suspicious of the Jews' loyalty to the Venetian state, the office of theological jurisconsult charged Sebastian Venier to translate from Hebrew to Italian the Jewish community's records dating from the early sev- enteenth century.53 The Libro Grande illuminates facets of the Jews' daily lives, including statutes on sumptuary laws, dietary restrictions, and the ordi- nation of rabbis. David Malkiel's examination of the volume reveals how sin- gular the Small Assembly's opposition to the architectural modifications was, given the Jews' general alacrity in executing all state orders.54 The Small As- sembly decisively lobbied against barring balconies, insisting "this is impos- sible, on account of the health of the inhabitants of these places."55 The Libro Grande does not treat the nature of the health concerns, but as Alberti theo- rized in his mid-fifteenth-century treatise proper ventilation and illumination were necessary to the structural integrity of a building and to the health of a community. Enclosing the ghetto apertures therefore posed a severe health hazard, a risk Venetians understood during outbreaks of the plague when re- leasing Jews from their ghetto confines.56 The Jewish communities' staunch</page><page sequence="18">144 DANA E. K ATZ non-conformity on issues related to balcony obstruction presents the poli- tics behind anxieties over hygienics. Following the Cattaveri's decision, the Small Assembly raised funds and elected groups of lobbyists to fight the Venetian state for open access to their balconies and visual contact between their isolated interiors and the world outside. As a space of transmission and exchange, the window most tenaciously mediated the crossed glances of ghetto life. Hubert Damisch remarks: Windows are always only one of the many gazes that the city opens onto itself. But a privileged gaze insofar as it is singular, individual, private, and one through which not only the street but also the labyrinth of the city can erupt into the space in which the subject resides.57 It was the Jew from his well-framed window who solicited the specta- cle of the city. The window formed a physical marker between inside and outside that was not merely a threshold to be traversed but a space to be transgressed.58 Ghetto gazes that penetrated also alienated, as accusations lingered in the air surrounding ghetto windows of Jewish sacrilege. Cardinal Lorenzo Priuli, the patriarch of Venice, expressed concern to civil author- ities prior to the renewal of the Jews' charter about the ghetto's structural frailties. In a memorandum dated 1596, Priuli accused Jews of committing several offenses that required immediate state response. Specifically, he al- leged that unfortified windows and unguarded rive allow Jews nocturnal ac- cess to Venice during which time they would impregnate defenseless Chris- tian women and steal the newborn children to raise them (as Jews) in the ghetto.59 In the same memorandum (which enumerates a total of nine Jewish abuses), Priuli writes that Jews would stand at their windows during proces- sions of the holy sacrament and scream insults at the Eucharist, "II vero Dio." Similar charges of eucharistie defilement reemerged in 1625, indicting Lev- antine Jews of blaspheming the holy sacrament as it passes daily along the fondamenta (embankment) of Cannaregio to serve infirm parishioners unable to attend mass.60 The charges blame Jews of deriding the Santissimo Sacra- mento three times during the day from their unrestricted and open windows. As Priuli's missive to Venetian civil authorities suggests, protection of Christ, as well as Christians, from bodily impurities required controlling access to ghetto windows. The ongoing conflicts related to ghetto apertures correspond to the boundaries (physical, social, symbolic) marked out by religious differ- ence that limited Jewish participation in civic life and denied Jews contact with rites of Christian sacrality. The establishment of the ghetto, in part, served to defend the holy and its Christian celebrants, as the Venetian historian Marin Sañudo chronicles in his diaries. On Good Friday of 1515, the year preceding the formation of the Venice ghetto, Sañudo writes:</page><page sequence="19">CLAMBER NOT YOU UP TO THE CASEMENTS 1 45 I do not want to ignore a depraved custom that has developed from the continuous commerce that people have with these Jews, who inhabit this city in great numbers at San Cassan, Santo Agustin, San Polo, Santa Maria Mater Domini. It used to be that from be- fore Palm Sunday to after Easter they were not to be seen. This year they were out and about until yesterday [Holy Thursday], and this is a very bad thing.61 Jewish proximity to the Eucharist, particularly during Holy Week celebra- tions, threatened the sanctity and unity of the city. For a Jew to deprecate the body of Christ concomitantly dishonored, denounced, and disrupted the body politic of Venice, the "corporate body having its own honor to protect and redress."62 Spatial controls defended the sacred barriers of eucharistie practice to distinguish the boundaries between Christian purity and Jewish perfidy, a division that evidently led to the social and symbolic geographies of ghettoization. Yet, the sacramental separations noted by Sañudo had been well established long before the erection of the high walls of Venice's ghetto in 1516. As early as 538, the Third Council of Orleans specified: As we are governed, with God's grace, by Catholic kings, the Jews shall not presume to go out among Christians nor mix with the Catholic populace, in any place or for any reason, from the Cena Domini day until the second day after Pascha Saturday, that is, that four-day period.63 Separation between Jews and Christians during Holy Week continued throughout the Middle Ages, gaining doctrinal support in the thirteenth cen- tury. After the Fourth Lateran Council's establishment of the doctrine of tran- substantiation in 1215, Christians throughout Europe feared for the safety of the sacred Host in the presence of Jews.64 As a consequence, the Council of Vienna in 1267 prohibited Jews from occupying the streets during eucharis- tie processions and ordered them to stay behind closed doors and windows when the Host passed in the vicinity of their homes. Anxieties over Jew- ish contact with the Eucharist were not limited to sacred processions. The Fourth Lateran Council forced Jews to withdraw to their homes through- out the duration of Holy Week to prevent them from mocking Christ's Pas- sion. Although church officials promulgated this edict in the Middle Ages, the secular rulers of Renaissance Italy, too, supported the seasonal confine- ment of Jews. Late fifteenth-century court documents indicate that the Gon- zaga princes of Mantua, for instance, repeatedly mandated that the Jews of their northern Italian dominion remain inside their homes during Septimana Sancta.65 In sixteenth-century Venice, the convergence of sacred ritual and identity politics likewise relocated Jews indoors during Holy Week. Venetian</page><page sequence="20">146 DANA E. K ATZ magistrates inscribed detention in the Jews' charters of sojourn from Holy Thursday to Holy Saturday with any Jew found molesting or in any way ma- ligning the solemn week submitted to severe punishment.66 While accusa- tions of desecration generally took the form of physical injury to the Host in which Jews were charged with attacking the consecrated wafer with knives, fire, and boiling water until it bled to show the presence of Christ, the allega- tions of eucharistie defilement in Venice reveal that the Jews complicit in the sacrilege did not lay a hand on the Host.67 Optical interference (at times cou- pled with alleged verbal taunts) could also provoke charges of profanation. As Kenneth Stow notes in a case involving the Jews of Frankfurt am Main, the annual celebrations of the Eucharist required protection from "wrongful contact with Jews, even eye contact."68 In 1462 Pope Pius II complained to city officials that the Jews' synagogue was dangerously close to Frankfurt's principal church of St. Bartholomew, since the sights and sounds of Chris- tian ceremony emanating from the church gave Jews sensory access to the Host. To alleviate scandal, Emperor Frederick III obliged "the Jews to move their synagogue to an unobtrusive place in the city, hidden from view."69 As Jews looked out from their windows onto the performances of Christian ritual, they ignited controversy by the potency and blasphemy of their gaze. The geographic propinquity of Jew and Christian remained detrimental to the achievement of eucharistie purity and communal propriety. Civil authorities thus removed the Jews from sight. In the age of the ghetto, defense of the Corpus Christi prohibited the phys- ical and visual proximities of Jews and Christians through two distinctive yet not incompatible projects of confinement. Both the enclosed spaces of sacred ceremony and the ghettoized dwellings of civic life closed the Jews' windows as an architectural metaphor for their rejection of Christ. The reprobate prac- tices of Jews treated in the Adversus Judaeos tradition of the Church Fathers required Jewish blindness to define Christian identity and to mark Jewish be- liefs and rituals as obsolete.70 The window, shut tight to elude sight, thus acts metonymically for the Jews' obstinacy, allying ghetto architecture with the bodies housed within. The two types of domestic internment veiling Jew- ish vision, however similar they may be in their protection of the Christian corpus, nonetheless offer conceptual nuances of confinement. Holy Week en- closures in Venice and beyond performed a cyclical and seasonal role in the construction of difference. The ephemeral in-house incarceration created a momentary detention in which recurrence was controlled and inevitable.71 The transitory appearance of this ritualized quarantine reasserted a well- established social discourse of civic piety and communal propriety based on variable representations in time and space. By contrast, the walling up of ghetto windows symbolized a permanent mark of domestic exile, an architectonic march toward civic isolation that</page><page sequence="21">CLAMBER NOT YOU UP TO THE CASEMENTS 1 47 built subjugation into the urban form. Ghettoization institutionalized a city of alienating environments that inscribed religious difference into the urban fabric and in it prescribed a larger social order. The Venetian call for the closure of ghetto windows strove not only to safeguard the body of Christ as it passed in the streets, but also to ensure that the surveillance of the social body was defined from the inside out. The workings of the city depended on the distribution of individual outsiders and close scrutiny of the location of those bodies in space. To equate the ghetto's fenestral enclosures solely with Holy Week detentions is to dismiss the centralized role surveillance played in the everyday life of early modern Venice. The constant division between Jews and Christians that came with bricking up ghetto windows imposed a vision of an idealized urban geography that inhibited the Jews' status as fully sighted onlookers. The conflicts over ghetto vistas in Venice reveal the ongoing contestation between Christian and Jew, between social order and disorder. Only the Jews' complete fenestral blindness could assure social order. Legislative exemp- tions at times deferred the reality of a completely sequestered windowless space, but the idea of an idealized geography that occluded Jewish vision lin- gered in the legislation. Windows shaped politics that crystallized community and redefined neighborliness. Their closure in Venice advanced public poli- cies of social control that diffused the Jews' gaze, quieted the ghetto interiors, and protected all that was holy. Notes 1 .
