Yet, the polemics ironically underscore the problem. As discourse about discourse and discursive practices, about communication and the institutions that putatively regulate its produc- tion (that is, are charged with preserving its normative modes), these critical encounters over theory, language, literature, and the like are marked by an uncommon rancor and lack of collegial agreement. The meetings, in short, are seldom meetings of mind. What we have here, as the well-known movie line puts it, is "failure to communicate" about communication. One of the special problems that "deconstruc- tion" (of whatever variety) has posed to those who are troubled by it, or who feel its terrorist threat, is its refusal to speak clearly and common- 81</page><page sequence="2">82 Joseph N. Riddel sensically in the accepted language of the academy or to honor the norms of humanist discourse. Thus its reliance on neologism and jargon, on a language of the uncanny, tends to avert an establishment bent on hearing its words reflected back not, as Emerson put it, with a "certain alienated majesty" but with fidelity of sense. Ironically, this aversion disguises the fact that "deconstructive" discourse generally inhabits the very language it seems to discount, so that in turning words back upon themselves it practices an act of communication that puts into question the very ideal of communication and education which humanist institutions take as their model and justification. When someone from the campsites of deconstruction reminds us, for example, that those who most vociferously denounce the "new" theory in the name of the old scholarly rigor most often reveal that they simply have not read what they are repudiating, they do more than score a debating point. They underscore the fact that much of our intellectual debate, for all of its claims to disinterest, objectivity, and logic, proceeds rhetorically and ad hominem. And this is not simply an aberration or an institutional form of dishonesty to be justified by the urgency of the danger to good sense, that is, to humanist values. Deconstruction has been quick to point out how often, and to what end, arguments of method, or presentations of intellectual histories, are developed in the code of proper names, like the developments of neo-Kantian philosophy or Freudianism: condensed genealogies which inscribe the thought or the "science" in a line commanded by the name of a father-author. Perhaps the ad hominem is the rule of hu- manist discourse, of that which proceeds in the name of Man to instantiate the values he mirrors. Deconstruction, then, even if it is the antithesis of this humanism, even if it celebrates what Wallace Stevens calls an "anti-master man, floribund ascetic," cannot escape this ad hominem history. Derrida and de Man are obviously metonyms in the codification of this negative humanism, of those who would displace Man. How curious, and how fortunate, that the latter should bear within his own proper name the issue at hand and the problem that cannot be properly named or directly addressed. How ironic! But now that he has, as it were, been removed from direct address, and for a time at least, because of the common courtesies, delivered from the ad hominem, we should not expect that that which takes his place, his texts, will escape having to serve in his name.</page><page sequence="3">Coup de Man 83 We are, however, beginning to witness something of his authority, his demand that we "read." In the tites of three recent texts addressed to "The Lesson of Paul de Man," we recall him ("Memoirs") in reading him, in "Reading de Man Reading." If this reading is carried out, it will not be, as he long ago advised us, carried to an end, and certainly not to the point where we will discover any "end of man" -nor for that matter, any definable or essential purpose, any "end(s) of man" ('fins de I'homme"). To put it another way, this reading will not lead us to theory, or even anti-theory, but it might well help us to reformulate what is involved in our desire for "theory" or in our pas- sionate resistance to what threatens us and our humanist institutions, that is, any theory (but it would now be called ideology) which ques- tions the very position that nurtures it. Even if reading leads us back, almost inevitably, to the ad hominem, we will have to revise our sense of what goes under the name of deconstruction, and, in a sense, de Man. What is the thrust, then, of de Man? In what ironic sense are we compelled to recall our foremost "theorist" as an anti-theorist, forced to conceive of theory in its negative, as that which can only be conceived (not constituted) in the impurity of a practice that makes it impossible? A late programmatic essay, "The Resistance to Theory," inscribes that irony which none of his detractors has ever touched, let alone understood: that we can never master theory, nor escape its lure, its entanglement. The function of theory is to revise itself, to trope or turn upon itself. "Resistance" is the key term here for what theory does to its own stance. This is why, as de Man puts it, theory cannot begin until there is a turn or re-turn toward language, a linguistic turn that puts into question the very "stance" or position theory would take, in language. "Theory," in brief, cannot properly begin and has always al- ready begun in the labyrinth, not the "prison house," of language; and in turn, it can never conclude or close. All this deconstruction has said in its various languages, Derrida's "pas de methode" being, as it were, the untranslatable case.' One cannot, therefore, be certain that the name deconstruction, as it appears in the discursive practices of Derrida, de Man, orJean-Fran- ,ois Lyotard, names a describable practice, let alone a theory that is 1.

Riddel extricable from the self-cancellations of a rhetoric it is supposed to produce. Indeed, as the work of Derrida demonstrates, deconstruction is not demonstratively self-evident; or to put it another way, since it is inscribed in a margin between theory and practice, or between cognitive argument and performative indetermination, it tends to reinscribe the one in the other and to expand the margin into the non- constituted whole. It thus determines the production of simulacra, including a number of deconstructive practices that give little indication of theoretical coherence, let alone evidence that they belong to a philosophical genealogy instigated by, say, Nietzsche or Heidegger, or by the Derridean intervention, and especially by the de Manian move (let us call it an American move) toward language and literary theory. But since de Man wrote so logically and grammatologically, wrote deconstructively of deconstruction, as it were, instigating confusion ironically by a kind of reverse rigor or even parody of the philosopher's man, perhaps he more than anyone is responsible for the bewildering variety of deconstructions in the United States, and thus for its inevitable misrepresentations, especially its localization as a sub-genre of literary criticism. Who else has written with such conceptual precision about the rhetoricity or figurality, that is, the literarity, of all conceptions or cog- nitive language? So philosophically of the impossibility of philosophy? Who more than de Man has tempted us to quote him making direct statements denying the clarity of ontological statements? For instance, this: "The only literal statement that says what it means is the assertion that there can be no literal statements,"2 a remark that works rhetori- cally within logic and cognitive assertion with the ironic force of a performative resistance, in the same way that a rhetorical question in Allegories of Reading serves to disturb the authority of grammar or a Derridean play on the double knot of the "pas," as both "step" and "no," marks the problematics inherent in our presumptions to know where we are going on the way to knowing.

Who has more vividly put a "scene of deconstruction" there where we think we see, in Harold Bloom's phrase, a "scene of instruction," put it there in all its figurality yet in a manner that makes us think we see it literally, see it in the very instant it produces a powerful blindness or disrupts the primacy we accord perception and logic? It is precisely this graphic, bodily, figural stance of "deconstruction" that he has made us see, made us see by disturbing the very innocence of self-re- flection. It is the "act" of "deconstruction" he will not let us forget, even when like Nietzsche he reminds us of the force of "active forgetting." How, then, can we begin to talk of de Man and decon- struction without reminding ourselves of what lies at the cold heart of deconstruction - the impossibility of theory, of a theory that can describe itself or provide its own example? In other words, always in other words: of the impossible possibility of speculation, of self- reflexivity? The only way of getting at de Man would be to clear away that patina of misreadings (his "theory" already determines them) which sur- round his work: the view that his work is nihilistic, or a "negative theol- ogy," intellectually anti-intellectual, and even aesthetic, self-indulgent, and decadent, a hedge against commitment, a retreat from the world and from history to the text and the hegemony of the classroom. One could itemize these charges, from attempts to associate him first with existentialism and the early Sartre to the more plausible identification of his work with the negative phenomenology of Blanchot and with the suspicious elitism of Heidegger.3 But they generally come down to 3. One could document these accusations against de Man's ironic detachment and disengagement, even in essays favorable to the rigor of his work. But by all odds the most extreme misreading of his "theory" occurs in two increasingly polemical pieces by Frank Lentricchia, the first a chapter in Beyond the New Criticism (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1980) where de Man is mistakenly identified with the early existential- ism of Sartre, and the second in Criticism and Social Change (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1984), where his alleged "aestheticism" is set unfavorably against the more en- gaged criticism of Kenneth Burke. Lentricchia quite simplistically links "textualism" (a euphemism for any kind of post-structural criticism that is engaged in a close "read- ing" of texts) with political conservatism if not political irresponsibility, and argues for the necessary move from text to world, to recall Edward Said's categories of text, world, critic. More recently, taking up a certain notion of pragmatism, Lentricchia has been</page><page sequence="6">86 Joseph N. Riddel statements of self-condemnation, formulated by quotations which re- putedly make him indict himself with his own self-indulgent irony. Like Derrida, whose "deconstruction" is regularly defined by a statement he never quite made, that there "is nothing outside the text," de Man has been hoisted on the petard of an assertion he at the same time insists language cannot make: that language is not referential, or is only self-referential.4 Or his critics point to his infa- advocating a criticism of action and even of individualism. If one were writing a "history" of de Man's intellectual development, it would not locate his anxiety of influence in Sartre but in Heidegger, Blanchot, and a negative phenomenology. It is within the problematics of phenomenology that his earliest concerns with figural language developed, just as Derrida's deconstructive project be- gan in a "thesis" proposal to explore the literary "image" in Husserl. Lentricchia's moralistic denunciation of de Manian "aestheticism" ignores, in fact, de Man's persist- ent critique of the "aesthetic," and his argument in certain recent essays on Kant and Hegel, that, especially in the case of Kant's Third Critique, the realm of the aesthetic is the "place" of criticism itself, ofjudgment, and cannot be read as Kant seems to assert, as the preserve of the non-cognitive. As de Man coyly puts it in "The Resistance to Theory," "Literature involves the voiding, rather than the affirmation, of aesthetic categories." 4. Derrida's oft-misquoted and misread phrase, of course, is the famous or infa- mous "il n'y a pas de hors-texte," of De la grammatologie, which Gayatri Spivak trans- lates two ways, "There is nothing outside of the text" and "there is no outside-text" (Of Grammatology [Baltimore:John Hopkins Univ. Press, 1976], 158). Derrida's text forces both readings or translations, at the same time, thus resisting the kind of conceptualization he knew such statements destined for. Commentators on deconstruction, whether favorable Jonathan Culler) or hostile (ohn Searle, who wittingly or unwittingly quotes Culler rather than the French text; or Eugene Goodheart), tend to quote only the nihilism, ignoring the neologism. They therefore can ignore the (non-serious!) play upon the pas which Derrida will later develop in terms of method and methodical errance; thus they make Derrida speak an either/or in regard to philosophy's inside/outside structure. Similarly, those who isolate de Man's questioning of linguistic reference and turn it into a negative statement, making him say at once that language is empty and that we can only deal with language as reality, conveniently forget or repress the situation of such performative utterances or rhetorical maneuvers. In any event, de Man has di- rectly answered this abuse in "The Resistance to Theory": The most misleading representation of literariness, and also the most recurrent objection to contemporary literary theory, con- siders it as pure verbalism, as a denial of the reality principle in the name of absolute fictions, and for reasons that are said to be ethically and politically shameful. The attack reflects the anxiety of the aggressors rather than the guilt of the accused. By allowing for the necessity of a non-phenomenal linguistics, one frees the dis- course on literature from naive oppositions between fiction and</page><page sequence="7">Coup de Man 87 mous, if borrowed, notion of the logical aporia (both coup and coupe, jolt and cut) that confounds language with a kind of insanity or Stevensian "mortal no," aJanus-faced or schizophrenic structure that goes under the now uncanny single name of "rhetoric." This de Man, the critic re- duced to a number of formulable assertions about the impossibility of cognitive assertion, is well known. We find him quoted everywhere. He is "one of us," though our darker side -the dei-homocide, anoth- er anti-humanist author of the non-author; the philosopher, to recall the Stevens poem again, who "sums us up" by affirming that our cogito does not anchor our being and we are not the sum of our parts. I will not proceed, however, with an attempted refutation of these negative descriptions, which could only end by a kind of reformulation and reconceptualization of de Man the philosophical critic. It little matters whether his is a positive or negative philosophy since it is pre- cisely the impossibility of these alternatives "deconstruction" has re- peatedly to re-mark. Deconstruction can no more say "no" than it can say "yes," though I will argue that it has a "passion for yes" (Stevens once more). For deconstruction can only begin within the prob- lematics of self-reflexivity, like a philosophical fly in the agenda of all binary or oppositional systems. Deconstruction is the uncanny name of the "resistance to theory"; it is, moreover, a "theory of re- sistance," hence atheoretical. And it can never proceed directly, whether fore or aft, as if it had an end. I must begin, then, again, as de Man cautioned the philosopher's man, already within a discourse that has, in effect, no inside and no fixed place or position - except per- haps as a double of itself-and tell a certain story of de Man's place in criticism, American criticism, as a displacement of criticism, a kind of in-verse story like that of Poe's adventure in the hands of European translations. Only this will be a story de Man. reality, which are themselves an offspring of an uncritically mimet- ic conception of art. In a genuine semiology as well as in other linguistically oriented theories, the referential function of language is not being denied - far from it; what is in question is its authority as a model for natural or phenomenal cognition. Literature is fic- tion not because it somehow refuses to acknowledge "reality," but because it is notapriori certain that language functions according to principles which are those, or which are like those, of the phenome- nal world. It is not therefore a priori certain that literature is a reli- able source of information about anything but its own language.</page><page sequence="8">88 Joseph N. Riddel "The Resistance to Theory" was published in the Yale French Studies issue on pedagogy, at some distance from where it was intended. It had been commissioned, as de Man's prologue confesses, by the MLA for a publication surveying developments in the recent history of our so- called discipline; but it was rejected, by the editorial committee, ironi- cally on the grounds that it was neither historical nor disinterested, but too theoretical and too abstract. It took a position among the plural- isms it described, and it did so with a series of problematic assertions which posed to philologists a threatening prerequisite, that we really attend to what we claim is our territory, language: "Literary theory can be said to come into being," he proposed, "when the approach to lit- erary texts is no longer based on non-linguistic, that is to say aesthetic, considerations, or to put it somewhat less crudely, when the object of discussion is no longer the meaning or the value but the modalities of production and of reception of meaning and of value prior to their es- tablishment - the implication being that this establishment is prob- lematic enough to require an autonomous discipline of critical investi- gation to consider its possibility and its status." Both the possibility and the impossibility of a theory of literature reside herein, but always as a question, for a theory of literature demands a critical practice and thus a theory that will guide a critical reading. In general, theory stands, or should offer itself, as a metacriticism that is at once atemporal and the genesis of a praxis or reading act. Such a theory would stand to itself as would linguistics to its putative object, lan- guage, unequivocally; even though "language" here, as de Man writes, is the most overdetermined word in the language. Out of this comes a "discipline," and with it the problems of self-definition. Literature, in its own nature, if it has a nature, poses the same problem to critics that it poses and continues to pose to philosophy: its figurality will not be effaced; it will not render "immaculate imagery." If theory necessitates a return to language, however, it signifies its own resistance, for as de Man has shown us, it is precisely this questionable entity we name lan- guage that remains without a proper name. Theory, therefore, begins self-critically, as a critical praxis without a proper text. Criticism or practice is not engendered by theory so much as it produces theory; critical praxis, then, is a kind of translation, like that de Man finds de- scribed in Walter Benjamin's "The Task of the Translator" (see Yale French Studies 69, 1985). Theory cannot name itself as a thing or object of study, cannot account for itself or refer to itself as a conceptual total-</page><page sequence="9">Coup de Man 89 ity. It resists the vocabulary we would generate for accurate descrip- tion, yet imposes on us a paleonymic strategy, that is, the use of old word-concepts in new and not yet defined or definable senses. The modality we would study is already figural, and we proceed, in yet another Stevens phrase -this one metaphorically addressing the ques- tion of metaphor- by the "tropic of resemblances," or "as the sign de- mands//Apposites" (my italics). Literary theory is no more than a foot- note to a problematic philosophy inscribed from its non-beginning. We are caught, originarily, in the Joycean "scribbledehobble." If "literary theory" is to return to the modality of language, it will never be able to efface its own means or to cease trying to account for itself, like a rhetoric trying to define "rhetoric." Thus the resistance to theory makes theory inevitable, even irresistible, just as theorizing ne- cessitates a practice, a praxis, an act of reading that will present theory as a story or allegory of theory, but will never produce a metanarrative. Two stories, then, unrelenting and without end. De Man often gives them the categorical names of "philosophy" and "literature," by which we might translate, knowledge and play (irony), his cognitive and performative tropes. What we have here, clearly enough, is a "the- ory" of practice, but only as a "practice" of theory -that is, a pedago- gy as a clearing of the ground for re-thinking. The MLA had commis- sioned a statement on successful practices. What they had received, and what they had failed to see, was a practical and performative mod- el - not an emulatable model, obviously, but a de-moded word - or the indirect, ironic mode in which formulable directives come to be posed or pose themselves, by a kind of self-intervention or troping, as objective descriptions and disciplinary instructions -lessons in how to read. As early as his programmatic essay, "Semiology and Rhetoric" (1972), which would become the opening strategy of Allegories of Reading, and as recently as "The Resistance to Theory," de Man would introduce the name of language by another name, one of its classical subdivisions, "rhetoric." This naming of the whole by one of its parts is, of course, a familiar strategy of "deconstruction," a systematic exploitation of the resources of metaphor, of synecdoche and catachresis, and of the paleonymic residue of old words that have long since turned from themselves into seminal and supplementary functions that mock the philological gendarmes. In each text, de Man recalls the trivium as a strange and even anomalous model for the critical question which, he</page><page sequence="10">90 Joseph N. Riddel argues, is generally denied or repressed in systematic methodologies that either use the linguistic model or its terminology. Within the trivium, grammar and logic, he indicates, "seem to have a natural enough affinity for each other," and from the Port-Royal grammarians to the semiotic project of Greimas, he notes, the pair has been considered co-extensive to the exclusion of the third: "Grammar stands in the service of logic which, in turn, allows for the passage to the knowledge of the world." The two endorse what Richard Rorty would call the philosophical "mirror of nature" or the representation (the representability) of Truth. Rhetoric, by contrast, stands in "uncer- tain relationship" to this linguistic grounding of knowledge either in nature or mind, because rhetoric is in effect divided within itself. Rhet- oric does not simply form a kind of binary opposition to the semiotic marriage of grammar and logic, but neither can it be disrelated. More- over, rhetoric inscribes within itself an "uncertain relationship," the doubled and equivocal relation of cognitive to performative tropes, or the "disjunction" of the semantic and the persuasive. It is not by accident, though it names an accidence, that de Man takes the figural name performative from "speech act" linguistics to mark the question repressed by a classical philology, the question of rhetoric's being two-faced, parasitic, and etiolated. All of these ironic and paleonymic strategies, these trivium pursuits one might say, are fa- miliar enough to readers of de Man, and usually considered scandal- ous by those committed either to the linguistic model or to a certain ideology. (One should note here his remark that "What we call ideolo- gy is precisely the confusion of linguistic with natural reality, of refer- ence with phenomenalism.") The equivocal relation within rhetoric is repeated in the opposition between grammar (or grammatico-logic) and rhetoric, in a way, however, that does not simply accentuate the negative, but delivers a blow to the structural or dialectical dream of a self-reflexive system. And, according to de Man, it is exactly this "la- tent tension" which "precipitates" reading and, in the same moment, the problem of reading. To put it another way, while semiology pro- poses itself as both a descriptive science and an interpretative method, it marks at the same time the incompatibility of semiotics and herme- neutics. Reading, in all its contradictory senses -of deriving or decod- ing and of troping, of uncovering knowledge and producing it - will become de Man's metaphor (or is it now a paleonymic word?) for yet another figural name for language -rhetoric. Rhetoric, a part, and in-</page><page sequence="11">Coup de Man 91 deed a suspect and certainly least trustworthy part of the philological discipline, becomes for de Man the name for a whole which is in effect beyond definition or proper name. In the first paragraphs of "Semiology and Rhetoric," de Man re- minds us that semiotics at its birth, or more precisely, in the earliest formulations of Peirce, appealed to the model of the trivium, and not as in its subsequent developments to a system of binary oppositions, as in Saussure and his structural and semiotic progeny. Peirce's descrip- tion of the trinary sign, indeed, for all its insistence on a rigorous logic, inscribes within itself the element and errance, or chance, of interpre- tation, though he offers it seemingly as an obstacle to be overcome. De Man does not pursue the example of Peircean semiosis further than this brief notation, but we might recall at this point both the irony and the pertinence of the condensed history he ascribes to semiotics, since it is a "history" that undermines or suspends the very presumptions of science Peirce's theory of the sign aspires to: its arrival at knowledge somewhere in the future.5 Though de Man remarks it only in passing, in an essay significantly entitled "Logic as Semiotic," Peirce himself had superimposed his notion of the sign upon the model of the trivi- um, identifying his tripartite structure of representamen, sign-object, and interpretant with, respectively, "pure grammar," "logic proper," and "pure rhetoric."6 The sign, however, also takes the general name of "representamen"; that is, it takes the name of one of its parts, so that the sign in general is grounded in something that opens it to another sign. A sign, he says, is made up of a "ground, the object, and the interpretant," and the interpretant, like rhetoric, ungrounds the ground, ungrounds as it grounds. The sign is open, at once motivated 5. Derrida, in an equally brief discussion of the Peircean sign in Of Grammatology (48-51), notes that, before Saussure, Peirce's semiotics inaugurates a science of the sign by putting that science in question, denying the sign's binary structure and thus locat- ing logic in the semiotic rather than vice versa, a structure in which a sign is rooted in a previous sign. Peirce "thus goes far in the direction that I have called the de- construction of the transcendental signified," suspending at the same time the "genet- ic" thing-in-itself which would motivate the sign and opening up the series to infinity, the "game" which Derrida calls the "becoming unmotivated of the symbol." 6.

Wiener (New York: Dover, 1958).</page><page sequence="12">92 Joseph N. Riddel and indeterminant, and in no sense a thing-in-itself. In Peirce's in- creasingly redundant (and entropic) definition, the sign names itself as a grammatico-logical function which is grounded in its own nature, but a nature which is always already a trope or tropism, as we will see. Each of the three sides -representamen, object, interpretant- is tied to each other side, in a set of binary relationships which cannot be sim- ply binary. Grammar/representamen is inseparable from interpretant/rhetoric, and the latter makes the former (from which it is nevertheless insepara- ble) indeterminant, a condition which Peirce calls vagueness. The interpretant, which can be nothing in itself, is the future and the "law" of the sign, a future which Peirce identifies as an open or potentially in- finite series, were it not that logic presumes eventual closure of the interpretative series. Knowledge increases precisely because the sign is incomplete, and the sign which completes it is vague, hence itself in- complete. The sign, therefore, would be a law without memory, a me- morial pyramid of difference. Peirce's hypothesis of an eventual clo- sure or "convergence," when oppositions of indetermination and de- termining interpretation close in some final truth, faces its own re- sistance in his emphasis on the interpretative act, which is not the act of an interpreting subject but of the sign itself. What Peirce resists is the possibility that knowledge, depending, as it does, bothfrom the status of the sign and upon an interpreting act that marks the sign's future, may not be natural, or even neutral. Peirce resists the very "doctrine of chances" he must inscribe into his system, and this resistance prod- uces the strength of his own performance, the generative (or is it disseminative?) effect of chance, an accidence that alone assures the fu- ture of logic.7 In brief, Peirce becomes an unwitting champion of 7. Peirce's emphasis on logic places him, according to Richard Rorty and others, in the tradition of Kant and the neo-Kantians, and not in the line of American pragma- tism which he is generally credited with inaugurating. Rorty will credit him only with naming pragmatism. See Rorty, Consequences of Pragmatism (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minn. Press, 1982), 160-61. Both Derrida and de Man, however, have tended to stress Peirce's inscription of rhetoric into logic, in the play of the interpretant, a condition most fully elaborated in the semiotics of Umberto Eco who, like Derrida, finds in Peirce an infinite series or "unlimited semiosis" which suspends the authority of any one sign (and man) and opens interpretation to a temporally developing "commu- nity." See Eco, A Theory of Semiotics (Bloomington: Indiana Univ. Press Midland Book, 1979), 71. If Peirce remains in the line of Kant, his critique must nevertheless be recog- nized to have some of the effects of Nietzsche, especially in its "doctrine of chances" and its questioning of the "thing-in-itself."</page><page sequence="13">Coup de Man 93 interpretation as performance, not as hermeneutic -his sign is dispos- sessed by its own nature, and is opened to the equivalence of another sign which is its "fate." Peirce's theory inscribes a "fate" of reading in which the interpretation is at once belated and determining, if deter- mination means anything anymore. In any event, the tropic function of the sign is prospective rather than retrospective and self-reflexive or dialectical. Take, for example, this remarkable instance of the Peircean recourse to the figure of trope as representation which is also interpretation: "A Sign is a Representamen with a mental Interpretant. Possibly there may be Representamens that are not Signs. Thus, if a sunflower, in turning toward the sun, becomes by that very act fully capable, without further condition, of reproducing a sunflower which turns in precisely corresponding ways toward the sun, and of doing so with the same re- productive power, the sunflower would become a Representamen of the sun."8 And also, we might add, an "interpretant" of the sun, not its natural "mirror" at all. The heliotrope not only attributes to lan- guage a nature, it marks the figurality of nature in its tropisms, a para- dox that entangles Peirce in the very web of that American Transcen- dentalism he sought so hard to transume. We need hardly acknow- ledge the fate of this sunflower, as a trope of trope, in the history of that logocentrism Peirce would aspire to complete, in his turn, but could account for as only one more chapter in the story of tropism. But the question here is not the nature of Peirce's sign, the anoma- lous character of which has vexed the future developments of semiotics. What I want to underscore is Peirce's "incapacity" (in his philosophical sense of that term) to ground his sign in anything but habit, that is, in the re-petitional chances of rhetorical performance: a performance without a performer, or grammatical subject. Inter- pretant and performance, then, are paleonymic (as well as anthro- pomorphic) terms, neither names for categories nor for grammatical units like the "subject." The "interpretant" does not presume an indi- vidual interpreter or genetic center. But as old names for the subject or self, for Man, they carry along a semantic mirage that allows critics of Peirce, like Richard Rorty, to situate him in the old metaphysics among the progeny of Kant.

I would argue, therefore, that Peirce marks a certain American in- tervention, and, Rorty to the contrary, that his inaugural semiotics is the very essence of pragmatism. In an essay that bears the curious title, "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities," Peirce makes the extraor- dinary equation (and equivocation) of the sign and the name of Man: "Consistency belongs to every sign," he writes, "so far as it is a sign; and therefore every sign, since it signifies primarily that it is a sign, signifies its own consistency. The man-sign acquires information, and comes to mean more than he did before. But so do words . . . Man makes the word, and the word means nothing which the man has not made it mean, and that only to some man ... men and words recipro- cally educate each other." This is not quite logos philosophy, for this "man-sign" is not a glassy essence but an interpretant/trope/act: It is that the word or sign man uses is the man himself. For as the fact that every thought is a sign, taken in conjunction with the fact that life is a grain of thought, proves that man is a sign; so, that every thought is an external sign, proves that man is an external sign. That is to say, the man and the external sign are identical, in the same sense in which the words home and man are identical. Thus my language is the sum total of myself; for the man is the thought (Peirce's italics).9 Identity is a curious word here, for the sign is not a thing but is dependent on another sign which at once marks its death and its future. The sign's and man's fate lies in a subsequent sign; and a part of its fate is to be superseded, displaced. The "fate" of Peirce's sign, its interpretative fate or consistency, includes death and the imagination as one, to evoke Stevens again. Man's identity lies with others. In any event, man is a sum that is not a sum, an inference and not an essence. What we have here is "Men Thinking," not Emerson's "Man Think- ing," though one might argue, in making man a verb form, Emerson had already inaugurated a Romantic decentering of the subject.

Peirce: Selected Writings, 71.</page><page sequence="15">Coup de Man 95 we recall, resisted the psychological grounding of semiotics, and also of pragmatism as we find it later in William James, but he did ground both in a certain notion of action or interpretative act, hence rhetoric; and we might say here, thinking of Derrida, that he anticipated the incorporation of death and writing. Despite the inescapability of an anthropomorphic language - of which interpretant and performative are remnants that make us think of an interpreter and performer - Peirce like de Man after him, and, to repeat, like Emerson before them, delivers a mortal blow to the philoso- pher's representative man. He de-positions and de-grammatizes, de-mans Man, as it were, and resituates him as an actuator, or what Peirce calls a "habit." What are the consequences of this "coup de Man," this derailment of the subject from its purpose which was thought so necessary for a science of semiotics to develop? Among other consequences was the problematizing of semiotics itself, or at least a marking, of its irreducibly rhetorical character, a collapsing of the semiotic and the pragmatic, as it were. In Peirce, man can only appear in a "Community" of interpreters or "inquisitors," so like yet so differ- ent from the community of ideal interpreters imagined by recent de- velopments in reception-aesthetics or by adepts of "speech act" theo- ry. For Paul de Man, this equivocality of the sign inaugurates reading - it is the necessity of reading - which, even if carried out by the indi- vidual, the subject, is regulated not by the reader but by a kind of intertextual play. All texts, then, are readings of pre-texts. Reading, which has always already begun, is rhetorical and performative, but is neither determining nor determined. It belies the desire for mastery. Above all, it is pragmatic, what Peirce called in the familiar terms of metaphysics, "thought in action."'0 10. Peirce explicitly rejects the idea of an individual action or thought, yet em- braces a notion of thinking as act ("thought in action") which would have to function somewhat on the model of intertextual reading. If man is a sign demanding another sign, he would also be in a network of signs, both an interpretation and the inter- preted. Peirce may be thought of as setting the stage for what speech-act theory would have to develop on the order of the performative, yet it is difficult, as Derrida has stressed, to find in Peirce's "logic" any motivational sign or anything like "intention- ality." The question would have to be answered in terms of a strict critique of Peirce's notion of the "unity of consistency," and thus the "consistency" of the man-sign. Eco, along with Derrida and de Man, tends to read Peirce in terms of his contem- poraneity, or as Christopher Norris, in Contest of Faculties, Philosophy and Theory after Deconstruction (London: Methuen, 1985), says ofJaakka Hintikka's modernization</page><page sequence="16">96 Joseph N. Riddel To read de Man through Peirce, however, is not to reduce the one to the other, or to identify deconstruction with a certain doctrine of American pragmatism, but to translate pragmatism as "method" into some of the newer currents and cross-currents (including resistances) of critical theory. Those detractors who sense in de Man's irony and aporia a nihilism antithetical to the visionary company of American pragmatists are not exactly wrong -those like Rorty and Bloom who would endorse the psychological optimism of William James against the Nietzschean laugh. Yet one would like to argue that de Manian irony, which delivers a blow to Man, does not relinquish the will to know. It may appear curious, if not outright ironic, to argue as I have that de Man is a pragmatist exactly in those moments when he under- writes a persistence to theorize against any resistance to theory. What Peirce called "belief," a "habit" that is a "rule to action," or even a "stadium of mental action" - a phrase Harold Bloom translated into the "psychic battlefield" of poetic will - is not impertinent to Paul de Man's resistances if one recognizes Peirce's refusal of the psychological model for a phenomenology in which the sign is always already deconstructed. Belief is not a term one easily grafts into de Manian "theory," but action is; and for Peirce "belief' is the vagueness, the future of the sign, the response to doubt, a desire for resolution, but never that which comes to rest upon its referent except in some overdetermined future that the very structures of the sign defers. In the two essays to which I have made extensive reference, at the very point where the question of theory approaches the vertiginous irony of a logic which defeats itself, de Man turns (as he puts it) to the necessity of pragmatic analysis or pragmatic reading, to a critical performance which must bear what remains of a theoretical or conceptual load. The "reading" inevitably assumes an allegorical mode; that is, the reading proceeds as a story told about the text, a story of story, a narrative of a of Descartes, it is an "act of translation by which to bring out the contemporary import and relevance of [the philosopher's] argument" (103). This reading goes against a strict constructionist reading of Peirce, or the reading of his semiotics in terms of its place in "transcendental logic." This latter Peirce, which is the one Rorty seems to allude to when he situates Peirce in the line of Kant and formal logic, does however see his science of logic as pragmatic (or pragmaticist, as Peirce called it), in that it attends not to "consciousness" but to "language" and to cognitive practices. For Rorty Peirce's pre- occupation with "truth" disallows the praxis of"conversation"; in Rorty's terms, the "play" of the interpretant is tied too strictly to formal inquiry.</page><page sequence="17">Coup de Man 97 textual knot. And the texts at hand are just as inevitably texts which in- scribe within themselves a story or allegory of their own operations - "reading moments" de Man calls them. At what point one asks, be- cause de Man's readings also ask it, does performance begin and end? And who performs? Who reads? If we answer, de Man reads, the read- er is nonetheless not a single or simple subject, not exactly de Man or Rousseau, that is, not Man as "glassy essence." Like Peirce's man-sign, the performer is distributed throughout the reading, and identified here and there as a meaning or what de Man calls a "constative" fig- ure. There is no position where one can discover a "will to power" over the text. What I am arguing is that Paul de Man, contrary to what his hostile interpreters accuse him of ignoring, alone among our critics has opened up the possibilities of an analysis of power, a possibility in- scribed within his own name since it authorizes the rhetoric not of a single subject but of a heterogeneous subject distributed through the textual field. Rather than teach us, in Heidegger's (or is it Holderlin's) phrase, to "dwell poetically," or as his detractors say, aesthetically, de Man has shown us the political necessity of performing critically, even in the "ordinary evenings" or twilights of literary discourse. Power, he shows us, does not reside in the individual or corporate subject, nor in the grammatical model, but in a discursive, rhetorical retelling, a mode of narrative analysis that is never detached or disinterested but which, more importantly, like Peirce's sign has its fate in a subsequent reading. Nor does power accumulate in the "community" or insti- itution of readers, that is, within an elitist structure of aesthetically de- tached judges. It resides elsewhere, in judgments or readings for which there is no prior or absolute law. De Man's "reading," however, does more than exploit the abyss which, Peirce foresaw, inhabits any logical doctrine of the sign and threatens any hermeneutical method or science of man. The reading moment de Man finds in even the most deliberately systematic "texts" (like philosophical fables, or even Rousseau's political speculations), as well as in literary or auto-biographical works, does not function reflexively or speculatively to close the argument, but on the contrary marks the moment of greatest perplexity as potentially the moment of greatest significance. It does not mark the text's absence of meaning, but the moment when there is too much meaning - the moment of textual machinations which makes the text a kind of machine. While semiotics appears as a theory of the sign, no articulation of that theory</page><page sequence="18">98 Joseph N. Riddel can close the sign upon itself: thus de Man's position that semiotics self-deconstructs in the moment of its most rigorously formulated statement of principles, and his view that Peirce's doctrine of the sign inscribed that moment most forcefully and ironically in the allure of its theoretical rigor. Deconstruction, therefore, can only re-mark the metaphysical desire inhabiting any will to theory, especially those theories which presume to rid themselves of metaphysics or go "be- yond" philosophy to science, and redistribute the text into equivocal centers ofjudgment which question all authority as they pose reason- able figures of reason. The impossibility of a metalanguage which might account for lan- guage can only be prefigured as a mise en abime or in the rhetorical ambivalence of all figuration in which the part at once displaces and supplements the whole. The example of philosophy's becoming literary in the very moment it tries to rid itself of the literary, to pass through and beyond the figurality and mediation of language to a systematic closure with truth, is an example of the problematics which deconstruction finds to inhere in all discourse. The discourse of deconstruction, if it can be called that, cannot be typed by its own style or strategy, for it would fall victim to the very illusion of totalization and mastery it resists. This is why there is no "style" of deconstruction, let alone "method," but only what Derrida has called the "pas de methode" and "pas de chance" or the grammatical indicator which allows us to read at the same time a determined and an indeterminate sense, phrases which are by no means simply opposites or alternatives but irreducibly double in sense and structure. This is also why one can speak of Derridean deconstruction and de Manian deconstruction, of two writers or readers whose "styles" could not be more different and who never say the "same" thing, even though they are often made by critics to say "no, in thunder." But rather than drift away into generalities and a negative descrip- tion of the atheoretical disturbance that goes under the name "de- construction" (a word which in French bears the powerfully disruptive force of the "de" that is not simply negative, as it appears to be in Eng- lish), let me turn back to the notion of the semiotic and the pragmatic that appears so often in de Man's consistently and rigorously logical prose. Even as he describes, in order to mark the limit, the various for- mulations of certain eminent semioticians, like Greimas, or of critics who employ the methods of a certain semiotics, like Todorov and</page><page sequence="19">Coup de Man 99 Genette, he seems to be already in the process of translating the term. One thinks of Kristeva's distinction between la semiotique, or the famil- iar name for the science of signs, and le semiotique or "semanalysis," by which she names the specific effects of language or signs within the body and thus the function of the body as a sign system with drives, instinctual reactions, yes, resistances. It may seem strange to relate de Man's philosophical discourse and his primarily rhetorical vocabulary to Kristeva's adaptation of a different linguistic vocabulary, though we are reminded again that it is one of the strategies of deconstruction to inhabit (appropriate might not be the appropriate word) the language of the discourse it is re-counting; yet de Manian irony, which is always related to action, troping, performatives, reading, like Kristeva's resists a purely mentalist or psychological model of language, and transcribes the Nietzschean "will to power" through a certain problematics of phenomenology. The peculiar sense of pragmatics and praxis that appears in "deconstruction," often in the form of a performance without a performative subject or writing and reading without a writer or reader, is not simply a rejection of intentionality. The deconstruction of the psychological or phenomenological self, of consciousness or subject or even the remnants of the old Romantic "central man," as Emerson and Stevens named him, does not simply void that center and ground. Derrida insists somewhere that his purpose is not to deny the subject but to resituate it, while preventing its surreptitious return in the disguise of science to its old position in totalitarian or authoritative discourse. One has to remember that for all the advances in decentering forged by Nietzsche and Freud and their deconstructive ephebes, what has recently been called "grammatical man" reappears everywhere, clearly in quasi-sciences like cybernetics and information theory no less than in the cries of nostalgic humanists and their oppo- nents, utopian Marxists - even, it might be pointed out, in the pos- tures of our imported "deconstruction" itself. "Man" seems to have an infinite capacity to be "born again," and literary history is the dispas- sionate instrument by which "He" sustains the fiction of his immortal- ity, as father and enunciator of a word without deviation. Deconstruction - especially according to de Man and Derrida - has found the possibility of that restoration nowhere more powerfully maintained than in the turn toward language. It is one of the consum- mate ironies of de Man to celebrate the turn toward language as neces-</page><page sequence="20">100 Joseph N. Riddel sary and yet impossible; for deconstruction is nothing if not a deconstruction of the linguistic model and the logocentrism em- bedded in it, an exposure of the groundless ground which de Man has encapsulated in a wry aphorism: "Philosophy turns out to be an endless reflection on its own destruction at the hands of literature" (Allegories of Reading, 115). (Try using that conceptually, or refuting it!) The turn toward language, the return, can never escape the troping activity itself. It is not a turn from an inadequate to an adequate model, or from psychology and history or even nature (phenomenalism) to language, or from a referential to a self-referential system, but a resistance to and undoing of the ideal of the "model" itself. As one French thinker, Jean-Francois Lyotard, puts it, deconstruction must refuse any obligation to put something positive in the place of what it supplants, most of all putting literature in the place of philosophy. Yet, "literature" (though not as a proper name or in the classical sense) does seem to reassume a certain privilege. This is finally the charge brought against de Man and the American grafting of deconstruction upon its methods of literary criticism: the charge of aestheticism and even anti-intellectualism which critics like Frank Lentricchia see in de Man precisely because they think they can divorce philosophy and ide- ology by extricating pragmatism from the doctrine of the sign. Litera- ture, or Art, as we will see, returns, but as something different, though bearing an old name. It returns as a paleonymic stragegy, as per- formative enunciation, and as critique. Literature is situated in the position of the sign or, quite simply, of mediation itself, and becomes the name of a mechanism that not only precludes recuperation of the inaugural word but the symptom of that word's original dispersal. Not until recently have American critics begun to recognize that the deconstruction they were importing as guide and index to a new mode of literary analysis had much more at stake than situating meaning- lessness or absence there where "presence" and "consciousness" and "meaning" (where Man) apparently were - that, to use Freud's terms, to place id where ego stood, or as Kristeva claims, to situate the "body" or the "woman" there. That "body," like Derrida's foregrounding of Nietzsche's "styles" as "woman," is more than a simple corporality, though it includes that. It is a sign-system with its own internal econo- my - Lyotard speaks of "libidinal economy" - and with a certain opacity and resistance to other similar systems. It might be called at once inter-textual and intra-textual, heterogeneous but not without its</page><page sequence="21">Coup de Man 101 order. It is Derrida's graphics, the heterogeneous marks of ecriture or proto-ecriture, which at once disturb and reorganize the semantic field and signify the infrastructure of every communication system as a situational and ultimately pragmatic locus. Gregory Ulmer, in a book called Applied Grammatology, has recently explored this function of the "corporeal" subject in deconstructive discourse, especially as it occurs in Derrida's La Carte postale, and appears in the con(de)structive activity of certain modern artists. " Derrida's book is among other things a deconstruction of the metaphysical residue in modern information theory, including psychoanalysis, and as such continues his old de- construction of metaphysics while transforming it into quite another activity. Ulmer describes this as "applied" grammatology, and claims that it has large implications for an engaged and even revolutionary discourse, and pedagogy. In terms of literary theory this has conse- quences for the old debate over whether literature addresses feeling or thought, is aesthetic or ontological, or how it is divided between these two senses of sense (cf. Kant's Critique ofJudgment). But I must turn here back to an earlier complementary instance of deconstruction in order to shed light on what is at stake in this privileg- ing of "literature" as criticism, or what is involved in speaking of a "critical" rather than constitutive "function" for the artwork. I there- fore return to the posture which Lyotard, mentioned above, calls the "postmodern condition," and to the function of literature or art in general within what we might call the adversarial politics of a cultural economy. Literature (for de Man) and art (for Lyotard) play a critical and deconstructive rather than a creative or expressive role in that economy, and theory appears always as revisionary or as a kind of praxis that destroys the orderly separation of knowledge and value. For both, despite their radically different vocabularies and even apparent ideological conflicts, theory is a practice or revolutionary performance, a kind of "unlimited semioclasm," if one may collapse Peirce's phrase into Barthes's coinage. 11. Applied Grammatology, Post(e)-PedagogyfromJacques Derrida to Joseph Beuys (Balti- more:Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1985). Ulmer, however, tries to divorce grammatol- ogy from deconstruction in order to propose a kind of"applied" program of teaching, a pedagogy which tends to idealize the personal presence of the communicator and which ignores Derrida's more criticalpro gramme or deconstructive staging of the prob- lematics of performatives, information theory, and other methods and codes that deceive themselves by thinking they can "think" beyond the old metaphysical pre- scriptions or develop a pure pragmatics.</page><page sequence="22">102 Joseph N. Riddel De Man and Lyotard come at the issue of theory as critical practice from apparently contrary positions, perhaps best defined in de Man's alleged ahistoricism (sometimes called simply, textualism) and Lyotard's particular kind of materialism or Marxist deviationism. In response to a question about the urgency of critical research today (1970), the latter would answer forthrighty that political theory must take its "inspiration" from what is happening in the experimental "arts": "it seems to me that the function of theory is not only to under- stand, but also to criticize, i.e. to call in question and overturn a reality, social relationships, the relationships of men with things and other men, which are clearly intolerable," something he finds lacking in "traditional Marxism."'2 Surrealism, it turns out, is more effectively deconstructive than any antithetical conceptual theory, even though Lyotard admits its essentially "negative" thrust, its open and endless opposition and interventionism. What Lyotard opposes is the dialectical model of theory, and therefore the argument that theory must replace rather than displace, master and organize rather than criticize, and thus reorganize the authority of knowledge rather than participate in a general economy of production. Criticism sets things adrift rather than correcting them or supplying a new teleology, and by its "no" or indirection seems to find direction out. Deconstruction, he argues, must bear on the "formal" and not on the "signified," and therefore revolutionary art - Mallarme, Lautreamont, abstract ex- pressionist art, film - by its radical insinuation into signifying space provides the best instances of endless critique, that is, of a decon- structive action that disperses organized centers of power. Lyotard's (and de Man's) notion of the "critical function of the work of art" might suggest analogies with Harold Bloom's more available theory of the war-of-the-poems, the "family romance" of intertext- 12. "On Theory: An Interview," in Driftworks, ed. Roger McKeon (New York: Semiotexte Inc., 1984), 19. Driftworks is a collection of essays and interviews, dating back to 1970. See also regarding the foregoing remarks Lyotard's Discours, Figure (Paris: Klincksieck, 1971) and The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge, trans. Geoff Bennington and Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minn. Press, 1984), first published in 1979. Remarks on Lyotard here make no pretense of taking account of developments in his recent work, including some before The Postmodern Condition like "Libidinal Economy" and "Pagan Instructions," titles in which Lyotard is working out a certain kind of pragmatist analysis anticipated in the earlier critiques of dialectics and of the cognitive sciences.</page><page sequence="23">Coup de Man 103 uality in which works of literature stage a tropological and revisionary scene against the authority of the past, the "father." Bloom, too, has more recently turned to the pragmatic and performative argument for the "function" of art, but he is concerned almost exclusively with the spiritual and psychic implications of the literary "act" of "voice." In other words, Bloom passes through rhetoric to maintain a more tradi- tional stance - that the "self' precedes language and both acts instrumentally and realizes itself in a perpetual agon or performance of the "voice" which resists reinscription in the body politic. De Man rejects the psychological (or psycho-analytical, really phenomenologi- cal) model altogether, while Lyotard appropriates a Freudian language and grafts onto it a linguistic terminology. Again, one should note that Bloom also aligns rhetoric with the lexicon (tropology) of the Freudian economy, but in order to locate poetry's force in the power of a poetic self which he calls the "pneuma" and to celebrate poetry as a kind of last-ditch survival mechanism for the modern "self." But the strategy of deconstruction is to in-habit this habit of the sign, to turn it back upon its own systematic presumptions of organizing a restricted or closed economy. For Lyotard, art works its "libidinal economy" in the cultural field, a field of signs in action, for which the rhetoric of performance is as cru- cial as the language of drives and resistances, what he calls "in- tensities": There is, in modern art a presence of desire, or rather a presence in desire of the death drive - the presence of that which, in desire, generates movement. The sense of desire is composite: there is in desire what moves, what allows something else to appear, and on account of which it is always the same thing that returns. Desire is caught in phantasy: being caught in something, it is compulsive, but it also has the force to make this phantasizing turn, and this force makes desire wander over different objects. This is the func- tion, a profoundly revolutionary function, that anti-art ought to perform. (Driftworks, 72-73). Desire "bears within itself its prohibition" or resists its fulfillment, cathecting itself upon the phantasmal. If art merely "expresses" these phantasies it speaks only to those with similar phantasies. For Lyotard, the evidence of "critical art" (which he elsewhere associates with the notion of postmodernism) is that it resists expression or the</page><page sequence="24">104 Joseph N. Riddel externalizing of phantasy by a kind of reversal or "double reversal," by turning back to mark the formal elements of the image or phantasm, thus freeing itself from the image or the phantasm - like Klee who does not simply express the regressive phantasy of a return to child- hood or the primitive in images drawn from "nature," but "reverses the relation between the represented and the formal system," re-mark- ing and making his viewer remark the plastic or graphic elements (the figural) of the artwork itself. This double reflection or image-matrix is not self-reflexive; or in other words, the graphic figure no longer stands as a sign of meaning, nor as representation of a phantasy. Thus, the reversal or marking of figurality, of the artifice or techne, frees the desire from phantasy and, rather than redirecting it upon other repre- sentations or delusions, sets it adrift. The work does not account for it- self but becomes an "oscillating work" that plays between the configu- rations of phantasy and a revelation that these figures are not represen- tations. Lyotard thus exalts what Stevens called "the plastic parts of po- ems" or those figures which resist reduction to understanding or conceptualization. By re-marking its own formal or technical ele- ments, by representing its productive mechanisms, the postmodern work at once disfigures and prefigures, or opens up the space of pro- duction. Lyotard's Discours, Figure inscribes in its tite a problematics that disrupts binarism or self-reflexivity, the play between the literal and the figural upon which traditional theories of art are based and from which normative methods of interpretation draw. Much like de Man's argument that rhetoric is an irreducibly doubled concept that plays be- tween tropes of cognition and performative figures, their relation marked by an unbridgeable aporia, Lyotard's opposition of the concep- tual and the figural disturbs the Saussaurean sign. Figure in Lyotard's sense is not unrelated to Derridean marks or re-marks in that it inscribes the inescapable plastic sense of the graphic, or that which can never be understood though it is at once visible and non-representational, hence graphammatological. The figural cannot be appropriated by discourse, or limited to conceptual and discursive purposes. That is, it is not verbal, or better, lexical. There is not space here to rehearse in detail Lyotard's complex elaboration of the figural, which he describes as three types - image-figure, like that of dreams which might be thematized in paintings; form-figure, or what he calls the schema or even sub-structure of a work; and image-matrix, or that which violates</page><page sequence="25">Coup de Man 105 and disrupts the discursive order of a work - except to point out how they function to resist a certain intelligibility and call attention to the indissoluable elements of a work that are beyond language, or in effect, "unpresentable." For de Man, one might say, they would resist inter- pretation but would force a reading. Figural language also dis-figures, as de Man puts it. Modem art, or as Lyotard would have it, the post- modern, is transgressive in that it violates the space of earlier forms. But again one should note that Lyotard is not using modern and postmoder as historical categories; witness The Postmodern Condition where he formulates provisionally the notion that "a work can become modern only if it is first postmodern," that is, only after having itself exposed or put in question a traditional mode or challenged all the rules it might have been expected to satisfy: "I shall call modern the art which devotes its 'little technical expertise'. . . , as Diderot used to say, to present the fact that the unpresentable exists. To make visible that there is something which can be conceived and which can neither be seen nor made visible" (PC, 78-79). "The postmodern would be that which, in the modern, puts forward the unpresentable in presentation itself; that which denies itself the solace of good forms, the consensus of a taste which would make it possible to share collectively the nostalgia for the unattainable" (PC, 81). Thus the postmoder appears unruly, chaotic, dissonant; not exactly a cha- os nor quite yet a "chaosmos" (oyce) it appears, in Lyotard's terms, as a preemptive practice which does not follow or represent accepted rules or laws so much as it functions to clear a space for a new "lan- guage game." It is thus a kind of fore-play, ajudgment before both the law and the letter. Though de Man showed little interest in this special function of the modern-postmodern, like Lyotard he seems to identify the "literary" with a certain disruptive modality or disfiguration. Modernity bears no recent privilege, but lurks within the "aesthetic" as a critique and a praxis. It is no accident that deconstruction has turned of late to the question of aesthetics and particularly to Kant's Third Critique as the scene where critical practice is staged in its most problematized ex- treme. Thus modernism, for Lyotard, is an "aesthetics of the sub- lime," the place where, as Derrida reveals in "Parergon," the enframing practices, the techne, are regimented to make taste serve rea- son, a scene destined to undermine its own desire for categorical puri-</page><page sequence="26">106 Joseph N. Riddel ty.'3 Figurality, whether it appears in the name of"rhetoric" or in the broader sense of the "inscription" or re-inscription of the unin- telligible, suspends the old categories and defers the possibility of cate- gory itself. Thus the critical aesthetic gives us the "impossible possible philosopher's man" as our displaced desire. Now, there are moments in Lyotard when one is tempted to read his celebration of the radical action of art, its interferences and technical disruptions of our institutionalization of understanding, as a kind of street theater or invitation to impromptu pedagogy.14 His praise for experimental art, from Artaud to Cage to Warhol, supports this view that the "postmodern" is anti-intellectual and anarchical if not apo- litical, especially since he rejects the argument that political action must lead to new institutions and to the return of authoritarianism (and of the author). Certainly this political activism seems wholly ab- sent from de Man's rhetoric, and from his alleged nihilism. Indeed, the charge against de Man is that if he appears to be inarguably pro gramme, he has no program other than to maintain the present elitist "scene of instruction" in which literary criticism, to refer to Rorty's 13. See esp. Derrida, "Parergon," La Verite enpeinture (Paris: Flammarion, 1978), 19-168. 14. In his generally uncritical approval of experimental practices like pop art, not to say, surrealism, Lyotard often seems to underwrite the kind of"applied" perform- ance Ulmer thinks Derrida to be providing as a mise en oeuvre in texts like Glas and La Cartepostale. But this would ignore the play and tension between discourse and figure, or between the congitive and that which resists its mastering power, which figures in Lyotard's calculations. At least in his early work Lyotard does not seem to be advocat- ing an uninhibited break, but is acknowledging, like Derrida, that any deconstructive practice must begin within and in resistance to the old categories.The practice of language games, as he comes to call them, resists the old discourse by refusing to think that it can resolve the antinomies of categories or reconcile the differences in two dis- tinct games.Thus it abrogates the transcendental desire of argument. In his Contest of Faculties, Christopher Norris sets deconstruction against pragmatism as the dominant opposing "theories" (or anti-theories) of contemporary philosophy, and virtually makes de Man and Rorty the metonymic figures of rhat opposition. Moreover, he identifies Lyotard's later pragmatist position more with its American developments than with Derrida and deconstruction. This tends to ignore the com- plex developments of pragmatism, or at least the "concept" of the pragmatic narrative within Lyotard's recent thinking, especially since pragmatism in its European versions cannot be easily disentangled from its place in Marxian praxis, including critiques of dialectics. Recent American affiliations of Marxism and pragmatism, as in Lentricchia, indicate little of this complex sense of theoretical praxis which characterizes recent French thought. Are we approaching what will have to be called "vulgar pragma- tism"?</page><page sequence="27">Coup de Man 107 claim, accepts the judgmental or critical responsibility of philosophy and reinstitutes the old values in a slightly disfigured old language. But it is not, as Lyotard points out, the revolutionary force of the signified or new concept that foments and sustains radical action, as if one could move from the podium to the street, or from text to world. What de Man means by the performance of reading and Lyotard by petits recits, by figural performatives in general, is the resistance they ac- tivate, the instauration of a movement that effects our relations with things, as it affects our "relatings," our language games or narratives of understanding. By bringing the old rules to judgment and the old con- cepts into question, figural interventions force us to do what William James said was the pragmatic obligation of all critical thought - to revise our vocabularies and thus alter the economy of our efforts, which means, alter the forestructure of our understanding by calling attention to the fact that such a forestructure or horizon is never stable and never determined nor determining. The inescapable resistance of/to theory names, as Lyotard calls it, the symptoms of our postmodern "condition." Language is as language does, and the doing undoes. But the revision of vocabularies cannot proceed simply as James and the American pragmatists seemed to suggest, by a series of untroubled and successful gestures or as an accumulation and progress of thought. Derrida has recently measured the risk of such a revisionary or interventionist critique or reading that would at the same time practice and try to account for the practice of a communication, and therefore try to situate the subject, Man, as it were, as a ligature in a communicative sequence or loop. This demands (de-Mans?), he says, or would demand, what he provisionally calls a "pragrammatological" analysis, or an analysis that "would always take the situation of the marks [the non-semantic signs of every enunciation] into account; in particular that of utterances, the place of senders and addressees, of framing and the sociohistorical circumscription."'5 15.

Joseph Smith and William Kerrigan (Baltimore:Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1984), 1-32. Derrida's proj- ect, then, would entail a deconstruction of the pragmatic, just as in works from "Signa- ture, Event, Context" through La Cartepostale he has been involved in a deconstruction of the performative and all models of "information theory." Deconstruction, of course, does not necessarily imply a rejection of the "model," but a marking of its prob-</page><page sequence="28">108 Joseph N. Riddel At Derrida's crossing point of the grammatological and the prag- matic, as within the aporia disjointing de Man's cognitive and perfor- mative, there is no performative authority, no governing inten- tionality, and certainly no perspective to measure the "power" of an organizing center. There is only a stereophonic writing practice which, to take yet another figure from Wallace Stevens, "malforms" as it performs, thereby giving theory that resistance by which it organizes its messages, those it receives as well as those it emits. For theory can only be critical or performative, and yet cannot correct itself or deter- mine the destiny of its utterance. Theory per-malforms. This is all that can be said for theory, or in the name of theory, and for Man who would in theorizing enact his desire to change the nature of things. I conclude with this poetic spectacle - again a poem, or a part of a poem, by Stevens. It bears the appropriate title "The Pure Good of Theory," and it speaks in its turn, as it were, de Man: Man, that is not born of woman but of air, That comes here in the solar chariot, Like rhetoric in a narration of the eye - We knew one parent must have been divine, Adam of beau regard, from fat Elysia, Whose mind malformed this morning metaphor, While all the leaves leaked gold. His mind made morning, As he slept. He woke in a metaphor: this was A metamorphosis of paradise. Malformed, the world was paradise malformed ... Now, closely the ear attends the varying Of this precarious music, the change of key lematics. "Pragrammatology," therefore, would continue his examination of "com- munication," a project he set out as early as the introduction to Husserl's The Origins of Geometry, and remains evident in his reading of psychoanalysis as an informational model that does not escape the metaphysics of presence and his deconstruction of the intentionality of performatives in speech-act theory. His essays on de Man, Memoirs (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1986), continue to engage the question of "per- formatives" and practice, which is to say, the recurring question of the theory- praxis model.</page><page sequence="29">Coup de Man 109 Not quite detected at the moment of change And, now, it attends the difficult difference. To say the solar chariot is junk Is not a variation but an end, Yet to speak of the whole world as metaphor Is still to stick to the contents of the mind And the desire to believe in a metaphor. It is to stick to the nicer knowledge of Belief, that what it believes in is not true. In this deconstructive moment, Hegelian "twilight" turns from itself into Nietzschean "dawn," in a poem that recalls yet another aphoristic line of Stevens: "Theology [read, theory] after breakfast sticks to the eye." The blindness of insight, de Man might have said.
