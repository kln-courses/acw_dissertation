<plain_text><page sequence="1">A' Sociological Theory of Language "Clima, Luft und Wai3er, Speise und Trank werden auf die Sprachwerkzeuge und nattir- lich auch auf die Stimme einflieB3en." (Herder, Abhandlung iiber den Ursprung der Sprache, 1772.) "They may not understand one another's speech." (Gen., 11, 7.) U SUALLY we judge from the roots of the words how a particular language should be classified. But language is a form whereby man expresses himself, his surroundings, his profession and his whole environ- ment. Language has to be taken as a mirror of environment, and the di- vergence of two dialects is nothing but the difference of environments, psychological and sociological. Below are given a few interpretations of language differences. Classification "Rural languages." They are marked by the avoidance of diphthongs and by many consonants, reminding one of stones, mountains, clods: Usual: (1) Czech: StrI prst skrz krk. (Put your finger through the neck.) (2) French: "Le loup reprit: 'Que me faudra-t-il faire? .... ' " (La Fontaine, Fables, book I, V, "Le loup et le chien.") Deliberate avoidance of the diphthong-hiatus!-by the introduction of the t. (3) Latin: "Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris/Italiam, fato profugus, Lavin- aque venit/Litora." (Vergil [of Mantua!], Aeneid, I, 1-3.) Diphthongs only in proper names. (4) German "Dock hart im Raume stoB3en sich die Sachen." (Friedrich Schiller, Wallen- steins Tod, II, 2, 789.) One diphthong only. The Attic dialect of the old Greek language and the Hebrew language can be taken for other examples. Languages of the plain: (5) Mecklenburg: "Ut mine Stromtid." (Fritz Reuter.) (6) Berlin: "Det wees ick schon." (Gerhart Hauptmann, Der Biberpelz, Act I, Adelheid.) The sounding s is changed into the voiceless t. Contraction of the diphthong into a vowel. Mountain languages: (7) Swiss: "Mys Lieb' isch gar wyt inne,/Dort innen uf der steinige Flueh." (Kiihreihen of the inhabitants of Emmenthal, Wyss, p. 30.) Contraction of the diphthong into a simple vowel and strengthening of the double consonant st into the heavier sch. On the other hand, the Swiss dialect sometimes changes simple vowels into diphthongs-Fluh&gt;Flueh. This may be explained as follows: the mountain, the lake and the plain are silent, and the people prefer the language of consonants; the sea and the torrent, however, have resonant voices, and the natives prefer the language of vowels, unconsciously imitating nature. The Swiss dialect is a mixture of the consonantal mountain-language and the vowel language of the torrent. The most strongly-marked ialaad language is Czech (cf. 1). 351</page><page sequence="2">352 GERHARD SCHMIDT Another characteristic of languages of the countryside is the condensa- tion of many parts of a sentence into one word just as a number of parts are conglomerated in a clod of earth or a boulder; whereas sea-languages divide a thought into as many words as possible, as water tries to part itself into single drops. Of course, the grouping of rural languages and sea-languages from this point of view is not always quite the same as that from the point of view of vowel (diphthong) and consonantal languages. As all qualities of character are contained in the human soul and as different men differ only by the preponderance of one quality over the other, so a particular language may be attributed from this point of view to one group and from that to another. A rural language from the point of view of condensation is Latin: invenimus= "we have invented" (indication of time and personal pronoun).' On the contrary, the language of the new people, whose trade was in the first place a sea-borne commerce, is as much split up as possible. "Sea-languages." The vowels flow into one another (diphthongs) like the billows of the sea. (8) Italian: "La terra dei fiori, dei suoni, e dei carmi." (Manzoni.) Six diphthongs. (9) English: "What frighted with false fire!" (Shakespeare, Hamlet, III, ii.) Four diph- thongs. (10) Cockney-English: "The most marked change of vowel sound is that of ei for ai, so that 'daily' becomes 'dyly'." (Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th ed., 1929, vol. 5, p. 929.) (11) Calabrian: "a dialect... , which approaches very much the Calabrian, because it likes to dissolve the vowels into diphthongs." (Gregorovius, p. 363.)' Another example for a sea-language is the Ionic dialect of the old Greek language. Sometimes consonants are not spoken in sea-languages: (12) Flemish: the words heb gebroken (=have broken) are pronounced eb hebroken. (13) Dutch: Heilige Nacht is pronounced as Eilihe Nacht. It is worth while to remember the Chinese and Japanese geographical names of rivers and seaside towns. 1 Latin seems to be the only great language of the Occident which does not know the use of articles. This is very important because the constant use of nouns in connection with the definite or indefinite article shows an analytic comprehension. The abstract notion gets in the concrete by using the article. Where the notion is generally used without the article, a lack of analytic thinking is expressed. Rome's great achievements are constructive ones-Roman law, Roman empire-not analytic ones. Roman philosophy is just "philosophy of life" (Stoa, Epicurism, Cynicism); there is no systematic philosophy. The natural history cf Plinius is just a description of nature, not science. The Romans never created political econ- omy. The Latin church based on Aristotle's system of the world, which is a logical, harmonious and accomplished construction, dislikes any analysis. Only at a very late time does analytic thinking break through again. It was disclosed by the mathematical natural science, anatomy, the modern "Venetian" method of bookkeeping and-the article in the French and Italian languages.

Therefore a water-lan- guage will be a sounding one, and its vowels will often change. But the earth keeps silence nor does its shape change for millenniums. Therefore the lan- guages of soil-dwellers are subdued; they are "consonant-languages"; and the consonants are the same throughout varying dialects. The earth, being silent, makes man more and more silent. It levels down his speech. A significant example can be seen in what happens to the letter s in the sounds sk, st or sp. All seaboard peoples pronounce the two consonants separately. The Western Norwegians say s/jilling for skilling, a Biondelli, Bernardino, Saggio sui dialetti Galli-Italici, part 1.

But the inhabitants of North Germany, when the sound occurs at the beginning of a word, have elided it into scht-stehen-and the Bavarians, still farther from the sea, have even transformed the final sound into ischt. Man can smooth down and level the surface of the earth, and he spends much of his time doing so. But never can he constrain the restless surface of the sea to remain unrippled. Intersect the waves and you get a horizontal and an ascending line-the position of the tongue when speaking the s/k. This is the sound you hear among people living near the seashore; whereas the levelled soil finds its counterpart in the flatter position of the con- tracted scht. The sun also has a strong influence on the formation of sounds. Just as the southern sun gave to Florentine and Roman painting the intensity, variety and iridescence of its colors, so it produced there a full-sounding language, the language of the open vowel. The fainter sun, however, of the northern countries is reflected in the more subdued sound of the languages; the open vowel is transformed into a closed one with a weaker tone-color. As in painting, Rembrandt's twilight, the Dutch interiors and all the pastel- paintings are the product of a tempered sunlight and could never have come from Southern Europe, so the change from the full-sounding to the dimin- ished closed vowel is to be attributed to the less luminous climate of the North. We can illustrate this by following the same word on its way from Southern to Northern Europe: LATIN ITALIAN FRENCH ENGLISH pagindis p5~sin6 plysint p&amp;asmnt PilItiim p1l=zz6 pallis pMlAce madama mcadme m~dtm Itamla Itaria ItAl-e itly Inimictis nemic6 Ennfmi 6nfm civls cIttidin6 cIt6yen citizen gener~tIs gen&amp;rrle ggnirH gndrll maresciRll6 m&amp;rkchhl mArsh1ll marindis marindi6 mRt6lt m~rIndr hon6r 6nor6 h6nnar h6n6(u)r Just as the color of the human skin, the feathers of birds or the blossoms of flowers are paler in proportion to their distance from the equator, the human tongue loses brightness and timbre.

The classic example, however, of reaction in language-formation to the influence of the sun's rays is in the development of Italian from Latin. The final syllables of the fourth declension in Latin contain an open u: us, u, uum. The cooling down of the earth in general, as well as the fall in tempera- ture which occurred about the year 1000, altered this open u into the closed o that has become one of the most essential characteristics of Italian since Dante. It is true that the temperature of Southern Italy with its subtropical climate is still rather high and that the open u has therefore, survived. (In Sicily and Sardinia people do not say: Torre d'Annunziata, Torre del Greco, Palermo, Reggio; they still say: Turre d'Annunziata, Turre del Greco, Palermu, Reggiu, and in the name of the town Cefalh (from Cephaloedium) the u is retained in the official spelling.) Inversely, the Latin u-declension developed from the old o-declension about 230 B.C.6 Why? We have certain knowledge that at that time there was a long spell of drought such as has never occurred before or since.7 Extremely high temperatures were registered, and the closed o changed into the open u. The progress of honor, onore, honneur, hono(u)r corresponds to a continuous fall in the scale of temperature. Grammar Similarly man's outlook on life and its changes are expressed in the construction of his languages, namely, in their grammar. In the antiquity of all nations polytheism prevailed. Polytheism is nothing more than the fact that people, recognizing many different activities in nature, attribute them to different causes, i.e., different gods. The variety of natural powers seems to them so great that they can apprehend no homogeneity but rather a clashing together of different powers. Nature acts in many ways and, because men are unable to attribute all these actions to a consistent denominator, it follows that there are many varieties of the words which denote acting, i.e., verbs. Hebrew (and old Judaism is the incarnation of the fight against polytheism) has not only thirteen con- jugations, but each of these conjugations has seven genera8 like Greek, which still has four ways of conjugating. The polytheistic Romans also have four ways of conjugating; whereas the later, monotheistic peoples attributed all acts of Nature to one natural power and gradually arrived at 6 Biicheler, Franz, GrundriB der lateinischen Deklination.

Of course, there is a time-lag, sometimes of millenniums, in a language's expression of outlook on life. Aristotle's monotheism is voiced by the variously conjugated Greek language; and in the very monotheistic Jewish confession of faith the old polytheism shines through-the sentence "Adon- aj elohenu" literally translated means "My Lord is our Gods." The existence side by side of the strong and weak verb in English and German has a parallel in the conception of the co-existence of God the Father and God the Son.9 A strange phenomenon is the generic classification of all nouns in every language with the exception of English. If this attribution of each noun to a special genus is not a survival of totemism, it is certainly an expression of man's ancient anthropomorphic way of thinking. Probably, however, its meaning is as follows: Remember that nearly all languages arose at a time when the average temperature of the earth was at least four degrees higher than it is today.10 Remember that the warmer the climate, the stronger are sexual impulses. We may then infer that the classification of nouns by genus means this: the creators of languages, in the foregoing centuries and millenniums, had the fact of the two sexes in man and the higher animals so much in their minds that they could not bring themselves to apprehend things as merely things without referring them to the male or female sex. That is the way of thought behind the English language which arose in a much cooler climate! Today sex still plays a much more important part in Southern Europe than in the North. And the majority of European languages sprang from the South where the perception that the higher animals as well as man are bisexual was so overwhelming that it was impossible to leave it out of consideration. Sex was the prevailing consideration; material objects were apprehended from this aspect alone, and they were accordingly classi- fied. Poetry All classic poetry is the poetry simply and solely of rhythm. Rime is hardly known; only by chance or occasionally is it used. Antiquity's feeling for rhythm, however, was so highly developed that language was twisted simply for the sake of producing rhythmical sounds. In antique verse the accent of the prose word is altered to subordinate the word itself to the all- important rhythm. 9 Whereas the Christian trinity is reflected in the Greek active, medium and passive voice of the verb. 10 Cf. p. 355: "The cooling down of the earth in general ... ."</page><page sequence="7">A SOCIOLOGICAL THEORY OF LANGUAGE 357 Rhythm itself is but a reproduction of the movement of the sea. As the preference given to the vowels is an expression of man's visual appre- hension of the sea (your eyes show you how the waves melt into one an- other), so rhythm expresses his aural apprehension. In recurrent iambics, trochees or dactyls the dashing waves strike the hull and the surf beats the shores incessantly, thus arousing in man his feeling for rhythm. Rhythmical poetry is, therefore, sea-poetry. That, too, explains why the poetry of nations as yet unlearned in the ways of the sea and uninfluenced by the rhythmic poetry of foreign nations is always prose poetry. Think of the Gilgamesh, the psalms or the Song of Solomon. Rhythmical poetry is still respected today, but it has lost its first im- portance, having been ousted by rhythmical rime-poetry. Whereas in purely rhythmical poetry the single verse-line is a whole in itself, rime- poetry is not complete unless lines are matched not only in rhythm but in the ending of the final syllables. This linking-up of two formerly inde- pendent lines by the rime (first found in the Gospel of the Alsatian monk Otfried in the ninth century and then introduced into European poetry by the Provengals) is the typical expression of a territorial way of thinking. If several fishermen are fishing on the sea or if several merchants are doing business, the company of fishermen and the guild of merchants cannot guarantee the same returns to the various men. But if the ground is tilled, it is possible to assure an equal minimum output by allotting equivalent strips of arable land as was expressed very plainly in the hide- law of the early Middle Ages: "the arable land was owned by the com- munity and was allotted to the several families or households only for usu- fruct."" "This much should be indisputable--the actual Gewannen-par- tition can only be understood as the wish of an independent community to make its members equal."'2 "The plots should be equal in respect of width and quality if possible."'3 And just as the plots are equalized, so in the same way the verses of a poem are equalized by means of consonance in the final sounds. In the same manner as the ebb and flow-the rhythm- of the sea is expressed by the rhythm of a maritime people's verse, so the equal plots of a peasant folk give them a feeling for equality which is voiced by the symmetry of their rimes. Should a scientist now proudly point to the fact that rhythm is to be traced back to the rotation of the earth since the irregular radiation of layers of air gives rise to winds and thus to the beating of the waves, an agriculturist could similarly argue that the law of the decreasing productivity of the soil gave rise to the development of 11 v.

There is a good reason for the fact that the Provengals of the twelfth century, living on the shores of the Mediterranean, were nevertheless the people who nurtured the idea of rime It happened in the century when they were completely cut off from sea-traffic. They were forbidden by the Normans to land in Sicily, and two German emperors confirmed that edict; furthermore, Raymund of Toulouse had prohibited his own country- men from putting to sea. (Both these prohibitions were made in favor of Genoa.) Thus the Provengals had to change to the territorial way of thinking and, this being the century of their poetical flowering, they ex- pressed it in the popularization of rime-the "Leoninic verse" as it was called after that Benedictine friar who worked at Saint-Victor in Paris during the same century. Apart from the shape of poetry-rime-poetry or rhythm-poetry-the manner of writing varies with the various peoples. Hebrew poetry favors the repetition of one and the same thought in as many wordings as possible. It is a poetry of opulence. Life becomes spacious and inviting only when man possesses more goods than are necessary for his most elementary needs. The stimulus of life is abundance-hence, the detailed description of the Taber- nacle and the glorification of the treasures of the Queen of Sheba, of Solo- mon's temple (it was the second golden age after the expulsion from Para- dise) and of the riches of Tyre and Sidon. Only riches can beautify life, and therefore a language is a fine and poetical one only if it is rich, if thoughts are not expressed in their barest forms like skeletons but in the copiousness of words. Old Hebrew, the language of metaphors, is the typical expression of Judaism's anti-ascetic view of life, the delight in abundance. If, in contrast, in Homer's Greek the same phenomenon (sunrise, for instance) is described over and over again in the same terms, this is but the first intimation of the central problem of Greek philosophy, which was developed some centuries later-the problem of the ontos on (the actually being), the prime cause from which all elements and morals originated. There, at last, was found in some phenomena something not subject to change-a "state of being" of a certain process. The continual repetition of the same words for the same process gives us the first presentiment of what it was that fundamentally stimulated the whole Greek spiritual world later on-the question of something that is eternal though expressed in the phe- nomena of change. This change is in itself eternal, and for the unchangeable we require an adequate expression, the continual repetition of the same words to describe the eternal change.
