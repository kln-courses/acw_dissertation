<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD * FRANCIS H. PARKER A EOPLE have been trying for a long time to reconcile their heads and their hearts, their thoughts and their feelings; and for almost as long a time philosophers have been trying to do it for them. A crucial problem in all ages and places, this problem of the integration of intellect and emotion?or the similar social problem of what C. P. Snow calls "the two cultures"?is especially critical in today's mechanized and depersonalized western world where intellect is so often divorced from feeling and where feeling is so often irrational. While this problem is seen and felt in all aspects of human life, nowhere is it as pure and extreme, perhaps, as in our attitudes toward and our talk about God. "The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob, not the God of the philosophers and scholars," cried the outraged heart of Pascal; and this cry is echoed in the more circumspect and sophisticated contemporary "God beyond God" of Tillich. The God of the head cannot be worshipped, the heart cries out; and the God of the heart is intellectually disreputable, rejoins the head. Of the philosophers in recent times who have striven to heal this rupture between head and heart perhaps none has caught the fancy or stirred the hopes of the American philosophical com munity as Alfred North Whitehead has. But since the master started this task too late in life, it was left to his disciples to complete his work. And of those disciples who have continued the master's healing in theology, perhaps none has been so energetic or resourceful as Professor Charles Hartshorne. While Professor Hartshorne has usually practised this therapy alone and unaided, he has on one notable occasion enlisted the aid both of another contemporary theological therapist, Professor William L. Reese, and also of most of the great philosophers in history. The fruit of this collaboration, Philosophers Speak of God,1 while 1 Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1953, pp. xiv, 535. (I owe Professors Hartshorne and Reese, and the readers of this Review an apology for the extreme and inexcusable lateness of this study.</page><page sequence="2">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 329 not adding anything essentially novel to Professor Hartshorne's earlier work, presents the physician not only as an isolated laboratory researcher (in the "Introduction" and "Epilogue") but also, with Professor Reese's help, in the process of actually con fronting and healing his patients (in the selections and "Com ments"). Hence this book is an especially interesting and valuable case study of one type of contemporary attempt to cure theological schizophrenia. Theological therapists are to be found among scientists as well as among philosophers, moreover, for even in science the intellect does not succeed in quieting the restless heart until it finds the God for which that restless heart seeks. Going "through the world with a reverent attitude yet an almost total absence of doctrine or belief?with a religious heart and a skeptical head ... is," as we are told in a recent book representing this theological therapy from the point of view of a scientist?a biologist and natural historian?Alexander F. Skutch's The Quest of the Divine,2 "a most unsatisfactory way to live." The cure presented in these two books is, in most general terms, the Whiteheadian3 one that God includes oneself and the whole world, with all its temporality and plurality, in his very own being; its name, according to Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese, is "panentheism," "surrelativism," or "dipolar theism." It would be unfair, and even impossible, to compare these two books, for while The Quest of the Divine is a distillation of per sonal wisdom intended for the lay reader, Philosophers Speak of God is, although it is also designed for text-book use, a sophisticated and important work by one of America's more dis 2 Boston: Meador Publishing Company, 1956, 440 pp., p. 13. 3 Mr. Hartshorne's debt to Whitehead is well known, and he and Mr. Reese confirm it in no uncertain terms in their comment on White head (282b) : "It is impossible to avoid a feeling of impertinence in attempt ing to comment on thinking so great as this. Not in many centuries, per haps, has such a contribution been made to philosophical theism." I can find in Mr. Skutch's book no admission that he is indebted to Whitehead; but he quotes Whitehead, refers to him several times, his theological views are Whiteheadian (note especially immortality, pp. 366 and 375?though Whitehead would not like this becoming the "immorality" it twice becomes on p. 384), and he repeatedly uses such Whiteheadian terms as "process," "novelty," "harmony," "concrescence," "ingression," and "society."</page><page sequence="3">330 FRANCIS H. PARKER tinguished philosophers in collaboration with a very learned and astute colleague. While this reader is not yet converted to panentheism by the Philosophers Who Speak of God, he has learned much from them and their position and their arguments are very strong indeed. While he cannot pretend to do justice to their work?or even to that of Mr. Skutch, for that matter?an outsider's view of some of the more striking characteristics of the attempts made in these two books to unite head and heart in rela tion to God may be useful at least as a symptom of their still un healed fracture. (i) The heart must of course get its due in any adequate synthesis of head and heart; and this it does, and more, in these two books. "Reason is as little the primary source of our religious insights as it is of the other beliefs we hold as true" (428), Mr. Skutch tells us. Even more, "spiritual truths . . . are not so much demon strated as felt; and their acceptance depends upon their appeal to something deep within us. With respect to them, the task of reason is not to prove their validity so much as to show that at least they are not incongruous with the accepted facts of experience or science" (17). Mr. Skutch's book is "an attempt to reach ... a concept of deity which satisfies the spirit's demand for something ampler and more powerful than itself to which it can give its unrestricted allegiance, yet which is wholly consistent with our current scientific construction of the world" (47). Accordingly, "the ethical aspect of the Divine is paramount" (76), and so "the final decision as to the reality of a deity must always be a judgment of value rather than an affirmation of exist ence" (136-137). Ethics and value are thought of primarily in terms of feeling, so Mr. Skutch's arguments often take the form of "we find it difficult to accept this gloomy conclusion" (423 424): personal immortality, for example, is accepted because it "alone imparts any high and lasting significance to the world process and man's attempt to perfect his character" (405), and those "who disclaim the desire for immortality" are saying "sour grapes" and are also "irreligious" (407). There is, throughout</page><page sequence="4">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 331 this book, a remarkable lack of concern for whether or not some thing is objectively true, a noticeable failure to see logical and ontological requirements?thus on p. 78 he seems to say that there might be a time when there is nothing at all. The same "pathological" theology, in Kant's sense of the word, is to be found in Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese, though with much greater sophistication, in what strikes this reader as a pervasive disdain for ontological and causal arguments. Their rejection of "the superstition of etiolatry or ontolatry" (164a) because it ignores "the other pole" of effect and becoming tends often to be a rejection of aitios and logos, for Messrs. Hartshorne's and Reese's reasons are often ones of the heart rather than of the head, emotional rather than logical reasons. The inclusion of the selection from Alan Watts, a very interesting account of the role of feeling in religion which otherwise has little connection with the main theme of the book, is a good indication of this patholog ical approach. It must be noted, however, that the authors justify this pathological approach as logical: "If love is the central reality of human experience, as science itself now testifies, then the idea that love, rather than stuff or bare spatio-temporal process, is the key to the universe is simply good epistemology. Also biology is finding that the social principle pervades all life, and this means that there is no anthropomorphism in taking love to be central, to life at least" (301b). And we should further be reminded that Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese also insist that reason must be used as well as feeling?thus they criticize James, for example (though not Watts), for sacrificing intellect. Aside from the relevance of feeling to theology, these two books do show a keen sense of the importance of feeling in religion and in life in general. Mr. Skutch has an extraordinarily fine feeling for the holy in nature; he is almost a nature-mystic. Though he fails to dissect finely, he certainly does not "murder to dissect." The value of Mr. Skutch's book is, in general, not theological but ethico-religious; Chapter IX, for example, amounts to a primer of mysticism and salvation. His ethic is essentially a biologically oriented natural law, perfectionist ethic ?the book is reminiscent of Ashley Montagu's On Being Human ?and as a popular lay ethic, anthropology, and cosmology, it</page><page sequence="5">332 FRANCIS H. PARKER seems to me to be basically sound. There is much wisdom in this work, no less true because it is old; and it receives here a new form which sharpens one's understanding of the old. Messrs. Hartshorne's and Reese's appreciation of the affective ele ment in religion and life I find academic rather than experiential; while there is in their book little actual feeling for the holy in life and nature, the place of such feeling is emphasized. The effect of this affectivism upon the content, and especially on the form, of these two books is to this reader quite striking. The most general character of this effect is a lack of concern for the -ology in theology and ontology, a lack of concern for evidence and argument. The books are not, in general, logi cally oriented; they are examples of "philosophico-religious speculation," in Messrs. Hartshorne's and Reese's terms, rather than of theology in a logical sense. Evaluation tends to be in terms of good and bad, superior and inferior, likes and dis likes, etc., rather than in terms of true and false. Thus, for example, Mr. Reese: "The brutal truth seems to be that certain types of minds like the abstract as such . . . The contrast, good and not-good, cannot on objective grounds be identified with that between abstract and concrete. Some abstractions are superior to others if they both compete for the same function . . . But abstract and concrete cannot compete with each other ..." (220a-b). And Mr. Skutch argues for religion on the ground that "the prospect of ample time, like the survey of vast spaces in open or mountainous country, elevates the spirit, excites the fancy, may even bring us feelings of exhilaration and enhanced energy, and stimulates our best effort. Our hopes, when rosy, stretch before us in endless perspective. A blind wall anywhere ahead of us, no matter how great its distance, chills and depresses us. In order to preserve our spiritual tension unimpaired, each occurrence and stage in our lives must lead on to another, there must be no final term of our inner discourse" (415). One particularly important manifestation of this lack of concern for truth and fact is the slighting of arguments concern ing the existence of God. Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese do include in their selections some arguments concerning the exist ence of God, but they omit what are probably the most famous</page><page sequence="6">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 333 ones: Aquinas' "five ways" and Kant's "slavishly accepted" (97a) criticisms of the ontological, cosmological, and teleological argu ments. They sketch what they take to be the general character and the main forms of argumentation for the existence of God, and they maintain that "every one of these arguments for theism can ... be given a more exact and perspicuous form than has hitherto been given them;" but they add that "this is a subject for another occasion" (25b)?which to me seems odd indeed. Mr. Skutch rejects as invalid his distorted forms of the traditional arguments for the existence of God?"the First Cause argument for the existence of God" he understands as only one argument and for a first cause in time, and the "Argument from Design" he understands only in the version which Hume gave it, not in the sense of Aquinas' fifth way (28-30). Yet he accepts the main conclusions of these arguments, that God exists as the "cause of all things" (346) and "the source of harmonization" (102). A more logically minded thinker might more likely accept the tra ditional arguments as valid while rejecting their conclusions, in the sense of holding their premises to be false or arbitrary. Messrs. Hartshorne's and Reese's book is pervaded by an evangelizing enthusiasm, and everything in the book tends to contribute to their message. The selections are primarily occa sions for the authors to develop their own point of view, and most everything is seen as anticipating Hartshorne and Reese in a more or less bumbling and confused way. As the authors put it, "the book is designed partly as a historico-systematic argument pointing to a definite conclusion" (viib). "Some will say we have imposed this pattern upon the material; but we rather think we have found it there?or, at least, that we have found some thing like it" (la). I myself cannot help but feel that for the most part the "Philosophers" who "Speak of God" in this book are Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese. This is strikingly evident in the allotment of space to the various points of view. 327 pages are devoted to the authors' point of view, 211 of these being the authors' own words and the other 161 being selections labeled "panentheism" with 21 representatives (including "quasi-" and "limited" panentheism but excluding "temporalistic theism"). All other included points of view receive a total of 223 pages, and</page><page sequence="7">334 FRANCIS H. PARKER of these only the 89 pages of selections from "classical theism," with 11 representatives, are ultimately opposed to the authors' view, because the "skeptical or atheistic view" (8 representatives) are more or less forgiven?the authors often answer critics of religion by saying that they were not aware of pan entheism (v. 478b)?and each of the 6 represented pan theists (46 pp.) is "merely a half-hearted panentheist" (197b). Furthermore, the 89 pages granted to the real culprit, "classical theism" (i.e., Aquinas et ai.), present those passages which tend to give aid and comfort to panentheists; many of the best known and most influential parts of classical theism are omitted, and the authors tend in each case to select what is, from their own point of view, "the key problem of classical theism" (132a). All this hardly tends to encourage the use of the book as a teaching text, as the authors intend it to be used, save by convinced pan entheists, or by masochists, or else by those who believe their own non-panentheist positions to be strengthened by the character of the book.4 Looked at in another way, the book is very like a trial with Mr. Hartshorne as the D.A. and Mr. Reese as his assistant questioning a parade of carefully chosen witnesses. Adverse testimony is carefully prevented from reaching the witness stand, each witness is measured by how far "panentheism is carried . . . toward its complete expression" (307a) in Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese, there is no cross-examination by a defense attorney, and the D. A. Opens the case for the prosecution in the Introduc tion and Concludes for the jury in the Epilogue. The Accused is, 4 For text-book purposes it is also unfortunate that the authors often refer to ideas and people not presented in the book and with which the beginning student would probably not be familiar?for example, Kant's distinction between humans as ends and as means (149b) and the fairly frequent references to De Witt Parker. Also the commentaries are often too abbreviated to understand, at least for me?for example the one on Aquinas ?though some of them are very valuable: the comment on Leibniz, for example, strikes me as very good, and there is an interesting discussion of Kant's epistemology. One good feature of the book for text purposes is the location of the selections in the original texts. But the use of the same letter symbols in the Epilogue and Introduction would avoid some confusion, and beginning students would be helped by a brief biographical statement included in the introduction to each author.</page><page sequence="8">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 335 of course, that Arch-enemy of divine relativity, contingency, and temporality, the intransigent monopolarist, Classical Theism. The tactics employed by the prosecution include not only all the old tricks of the law court and the debating hall but also the new ones of the Madison Avenue human engineers. In the first place, the witnesses are carefully selected and questioned to bring out the whole "truth" and nothing but the "truth." Naturally most of the evidence favors the plaintiff, and witnesses are not permitted to air contrary evidence. Thus, for example, is Royce 's powerful argument against realism ignored: "Royce defined realism as the doctrine that being is independent of our ideas; but from this he inferred that our ideas must be wholly inde pendent of being, from which, again, it would follow that they had no tendency to be true. This of course is fallacious; inde pendence need not be a symmetrical relation" (197a). It is all very well to say that the relation need not be symmetrical and that ideas are dependent on things while things are independent of ideas (and I personally agree with this) ; but this ignores Royce 's argument that if this were true one would be able to infer the existence of the relevant thing from the idea dependent on it, and this would make all ideas true. More interesting than the exclu sion of contrary evidence, however, is the fact that the prosecutors occasionally slip by omitting favorable evidence and permitting unfavorable evidence. Thus, for example, in the selection on Aristotle they fail to adduce the standard (but debatable) con tention that the active reason in man is identical with God, and they fail to exploit the quoted (66b) passage that "life and dura tion continuous and eternal belong to God." And the attorneys miss the damning slip of the "panentheist" witness lqbal that "the ultimate Self . . . 'can afford to dispense with all the worlds'" (294b). In the second place, the classification of the witnesses manifests at least as much engineering as their selection does. The major ostensible classification is into the two extremes of classical theism and pantheism with panentheism the golden mean represented both from the witness stand and the pro secuting attorneys. "Could anything be more hopeless than the attempts to adjudicate this issue [between classical theism and</page><page sequence="9">336 FRANCIS H. PARKER pantheism] without attaining a higher standpoint than either party has to offer?" (177b). " 'You are all of you right and all of you in error, right in refusing to accept your opponent's position, wrong in supposing the choice lies between you'" (512b). Damning all these parties from the outside are the skeptics and atheists, but they sin by reason of ignorance of panentheism. Some of the classifications seem more amusing than irritat ing. Plotinus' "Emanationism" is classified separately, for instance, in spite of the assertion that "emanationism, in its treat ment of contingency and necessity, is not a distinctive position with respect to Spinozistic pantheism, classical theism, or panen theism" and "can only coincide with one of these or else dissolve into mere ambiguity" (221b). Again, if "Ramanuja is perhaps closer to classical theism than to genuine pantheism" (186b), why not so classify him and thus add seven and a half pages of weight of apparent evidence for the prisoner in the dock, classical theism? If Feuerbach is a "skeptic or atheist," why isn't Wieman? And why is Royce "classical," especially if Schelling and Peirce are "modern"? Is it because Royce is a "pantheist" and Schelling and Peirce are "panentheists"? Why, in general, are only panentheism and "extreme temporalistic theism" 'modern'? Why is there no modern "classical theism" or "pan theism"? Is it because, while "we should be grateful to our theological . . . ancestors who sought simplicity in their notions about God and thus took a necessary first step in our behalf . . . It is harder to feel gratitude toward their contemporary dis ciples . . . who employ the 'method of tenacity' in defense of ancient ideas" (la)? Or is it because everyone wants his theology, like his cigarette and his car, to be modern and for the young in heart? Some of the classifications, however, seem to me irritatingly inaccurate. The outstanding example of this is the classification of Plato as a panentheist, albeit an "ancient or quasi-" one. The authors constantly identify "soul" with "God"?e.g., "the self moving deity of the Phaedrus" (54b)-?even though there is no evidence for this in their selections, nor even in other Platonic texts, so far as I know. The sole basis for the classification of Plato as a panentheist, so far as I can see, is Plato's reference in</page><page sequence="10">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 337 the Timaeus to the "creature," the "child," as a "god"; and the authors do not discuss the relation of this occurrence of the word to the Demiurge-God. Mobility is not connected with the word "god" in any of the other selected passages, and there is no men tion at all of the Receptacle, the principle of becoming, which is quite distinct from the Demiurge-God. To sustain the classifica tion of Plato as a panentheist the Receptacle would have to be said to be an aspect of God. Finally, the notion of the Demiurge God, which would seem to count against their classification of Plato as a panentheist, is first ruled out as "mythical" and then, after the classification has been made, apparently readmitted as genuine: "Certain conceptions of deity contrary to those we have considered, such as the conception of a demiurge . . . are mythical" (56a). Yet, in apparent contradiction, they allege that "Plotinus . . . really does substantially reaffirm the Platonic view. The three aspects of the ultimate in the Timaeus?the form of the Good . . ., the eternal demiurge, and the created divinity or world soul?reappear as the One, the . . . Nous, and the World Soul of Plotinus" (211a) ; and "for Whitehead . . . the primordial nature of God . . . is . . . Plato's demiurge ..." (276a). The inter pretation of Plato is, it seems to me, rather far-fetched. The affectivism of these two books results in their use of quite a number of other non-logical techniques. Another Madison Avenue technique, institutionalized, I believe, by George Washington Hill and noticeably utilized by Messrs. Hart shorne and Reese, is constant repetition. The weary reader tends to be beaten into an exasperated acceptance of panentheism through sheer repetition of its sales-pitch and slogans in the Introduction to the book, the introductions to all of the selections, the comments on the selections, and, finally, in the Epilogue which, so far as I can tell, adds nothing essential to the Introduc tion. The hidden persuader is also effectively employed; who would expect, for instance, that the book's best summary criticism of "classical theism" would be hidden away in the Com ment on Sankara (though the pages are thus referred to in the index), especially when Sankara is classified as a pantheist? Still another persuasive technique is the argument via pejoratives, which takes a number of forms. There is Messrs. Hartshorne's</page><page sequence="11">338 FRANCIS H. PARKER and Reese's frequent use?in common, it must be said, with many philosophers?of the disparaging "mere": "the distinction be tween panentheism and mere theism, on the one hand, and mere pantheism, on the other" (302a) ; "the merely abstract absolute essence" (301b); "'being' connotes a mere abstraction" (242b). There is Mr. Skutch's unexplained and disparaging use, charac teristic of the scientifically minded, of the word "improbable": "Russell's assertion that the Universe contains nothing non human worthy of our worship is an inherently improbable state ment" (47), for example; or again, "the highly improbable assumption that [the mind] will eventually be equipped with a resurrected body," it being "more probable that spiritual survival depends upon the cultivation in this present life of interests which lead the mind forth from its fleshly habitation" (418). It is strange that a scientist should not be aware, as Messrs. Hart shorne and Reese apparently are (in their Comment on Dennes, 492-495), of the fact that probability and hypothesis can have no meaning with respect to propositions against which nothing could count as evidence. "... the wise and prudent man . . . will accept immortality as a working hypothesis, whose truth is to be tested by the outcome of the great experiment of living" (417), even though if that "hypothesis" is false it cannot be so proven. Again, there is Messrs. Hartshorne's and Reeses's use of the expression "not real" to damn a position which Falls Short of "real" panentheism. Among Messrs. Hartshorne's and Reeses' "panentheists," some?Schweitzer, for instance?seem not to be real ones, so that the authors' own panentheism seems to be the only real one, just as Camels is the only real cigarette. Yet Radhakrishnan, according to our authors' presentation of his view, might well seem to be just as real a panentheist as the authors, if not a realer one. And then there is the argument-by hyphenation:5 "To describe the knowing-of-all-things is to describe all things known" (21b) ; "if the having-been-of-the half-line is fact, then the half-line ... is fact" (96a) ; "if the awareness-of-X is an immutable whole, then X is immutable too" (93a); if "There is God, the cause, and there is the world, 5 Discussed on pp. 344-45 below in a different context.</page><page sequence="12">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 339 the effect," then "there is God-and-World, Cause-and Effect" (190b). The circular argument is also used, at least in one important place: "All views other than ETCKW [i.e., panen theism] sacrifice categoriality." To omit the T, for instance, is to "make the category of temporality (and with it contingency, relativity, diversity, complexity) extrinsic to God . . . Thus ETCKW is the truly categorial conception of the supreme, the con ception that reduces the categories to their proper status as essentially expressions of deity" (21a-b). But this begs the ques tion, for a "category" is universal (15a) and for time to be universal it must also apply to God. Hence if time is a category, it applies to God. But time is a category only if it applies (also) to God. Then there is also, as one might expect from theological therapists, the psychoanalytic argument: "... consciously Descartes has the classical pseudo-idea of the divine nature but . . . unconsciously he has the genuine idea which all men . . . intuitively have, the dipolar conception . . ." (136b-137a). To this I hope that the only alternative is not Mr. Skutch's: "One's knowledge of himself as subject is complete; for obviously he can have no thought or feeling of which he is not aware, no shade of consciousness of which he is not conscious" (49). Finally, in our random list of utilized techniques of persua sion, Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese demonstrate that they are true Americans in their use of "the bigger the better (and truer)." "More," "greater," "inclusive," "contains," etc., are constantly used as synonyms for "better" and "truer." The most basic instance of this logical Americanism is the argument that God must include the world since if God excluded the world then God plus the world would be greater than God who is by definition "the greatest": ". . .if this independent factor be all of God, [as classical theism maintains] then God-and-what-is-other-than-God must be a total reality greater (more inclusive) than God . . . nothing can be more than the totality of being and value" (505b).6 When I read this argument I thought of 6 Cf. Mr. Hartshorne in this Review, I, (September 1947), p. 26: "... the very notion that there is a better than the totality self-contradict orily posits a super-totality inclusive of the value of this 'better'."</page><page sequence="13">340 FRANCIS H. PARKER William James' hunters arguing whether one goes round a treed squirrel; a thing may be quantitatively greater without being truer, more real, or qualitatively more perfect. Yet Messrs. Hart shorne and Reese apparently intend to identify these two mean ings of "greater" in their doctrine, and their book is in general marked by quantitative thinking: ". . .to depend . . . upon all other things, is ... a unique maximum, since ordinary things depend only upon some other things ..." (505a). I should think that the maximum of dependency is rather dependency in every respect than dependency on everything?to be helpless, to have next to no being. Be that as it may, while Messrs. Hart shorne and Reese thus seem to argue that their doctrine is truest because it is biggest or most inclusive, their own selection from and comment on Professor Paul Weiss7 seems to make his theory truer still, for his view seems to synthesize not only classical theism and pantheism but panentheism as well. (ii) The head, as well as the heart, must get its due in any ade quate synthesis of head and heart; and this it does, in these two books, in the rationalism that is heir to Descartes and his fol lowers. In addition to rationalism in the sense of a methodology of logic and coherence, reason gets its due, or more than its due, in the form of an epistemological rationalism that thought or the rational is constitutive of or identical with the real. In Mr. Skutch this epistemological rationalism is primarily Kantian (v. 56-57), though he goes further than Kant both in the direction of idealism and also, paradoxically, in the direction of realism. "Our effort to understand" is not "an attempt to seize or recover that which already exists," as the realist says it is; it is rather a "radically constructive endeavor" (308) in which "the universals or general ideas under which we try to subsume all our impressions . . . are never given to us by the external world, 7 Taken from "God and the World" in Science, Philosophy and Religion: a Symposium, New York: Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., 1941.</page><page sequence="14">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 341 which invariably shows us only particular men, trees, and violets, but are distilled by the mind from its own experi ence" (307). Not only universals, moreover, but "even our immediate sensuous impressions are the mind's own crea tions" (307). "Whenever we look at some external object, our mind produces something new, which did not previously exist. The image which springs up in consciousness ... is no mere copy of its original but a newborn child, of which the mind is the mother and the external object the father. We suppose that the child bears some similarity to its sire; but we can never know the degree of this resemblance; for the father reveals himself to the mother only in their child . . . The uncritical mind is apt naively to confuse the child with its father, failing to distinguish between them," but the "father" is "unknown" (306-307). Even though the external object is unknown, however, we know that there is an external thing which fathers our mental creation, according to Mr. Skutch. Even though our knowledge is confined to our own mental creations, we know that these mental creations are "based . . . upon the objective world" (307). "That they somehow correspond or run parallel to the hidden course of the objective world, follows from the fact that when our theories are of the sort that we call "true" we can draw from them deductions or predictions, which we can verify by their corre spondence with observed events" (307-308). Mr. Skutch seems to have forgotten, however, that he has just said that these observed events are themselves mental creations, so of course their occurrence in no way indicates the existence or corre spondence of an objective world. "As Berkeley insisted, only an idea can resemble an idea" (306) ; "how can we pluck an idea from the mind and place it beside the original . . . and see whether . . . the two correspond?" (58). The joint assertion of "the mind knows only its own creations" and "there is an inde pendent world to which those mental creations correspond" seems to me to be clearly and inevitably a contradiction, and Mr. Skutch grants that his doctrine "must, of course, contain no logical inconsistencies" (431). This mentalistic epistemology must thus force Mr. Skutch to "start our inquiry with ourselves in the manner so congenial to philosophers" (50), even though</page><page sequence="15">342 FRANCIS H. PARKER he claims to reject this mentalistic approach as well as "the scientific" approach from matter to mind (52) in favor of "a provisional dualism" which provides that mind and matter "pos sess one 'dimension' or attribute in common" (53) and have "a common origin" or "one single ground or substance" of which matter and mind are two "modes of appearance" (54). And it must also force Mr. Skutch to end his inquiry with mind in the manner so congenial to idealistic philosophers, and not even assert that there is matter or a single ground of which matter and mind are both appearances, for his mentalistic epistemology claims that our sensory and conceptual objects are all "the mind's own creations." Some philosophers, perhaps even Kant, have seen this prob lem of the incompatibility of universal mental constructionism with realistic assertion of extra-mental things and have argued that there is no contradiction present here. But Mr. Skutch does not seem even to see that there is any problem here in his epistemol ogy, nor that his idealistic, Kantian epistemology could never sup port his realistic, natural law, Aristotelean ethic of actualization and "harmonization." He rather merely asserts, ambiguously and paradoxically, that "we add to the totality of existence a new 'dimension' or realm, which rests upon and from one point of view duplicates the physical world of bodies and movements, but in another sense is a wholly new construction" (308), that "knowl edge . . . rests upon the natural world and ... is controlled by it, yet ... is in the fullest sense a new creation" (310). This feature as well as others in the book8 indicate that philosophical sophis tication is not Mr. Skutch's forte?though I assume that it should not be expected to be since he is not a professional philosopher. Of his philosophical naivety he seems, moreover, honestly aware: "I am acutely conscious of the perils I incur in offering . . . this first fruit of my meditations"; and "there will be those who point out that the mind that conceived this work was not adequately critical, but rushed to premature conclusions on some of the most 8 For instance, on p. 113 his argument that "there can be only one primary beneficent principle" or God on the ground that God is the maker of unity and order seems oblivious of the criticism, famous in Hume, that a unified product may be authored by several agents.</page><page sequence="16">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 343 difficult and controversial questions of philosophy" (14). Mr. Skutch is clearly widely read in philosophy and also in litera ture, however; and he assures us that he has "in fact pondered these problems far more carefully than might appear from the book," that he has condensed his "more important conclusions into a smaller volume," and that if his book "proves attractive to enough readers," he "can promise them a more adequate dis cussion of some of the more difficult points in the near future" (14-15). I myself am a reader who is enough attracted to want more from Mr. Skutch, not for his technical philosophy but for his intuitive appreciation of nature and life. This contradiction of knowing a trans-empirical, extra mental unknowable is avoided by Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese, not so much by denying that the object of knowledge is mental as by denying that there is anything else but the mental. True, the object of knowledge is not dependent upon or related to the mind that knows it: "The cognitive reference is something real in and for mind, not in the things referred to" (148a). "Aquin as .. . makes a fine contribution to the theory of "external" and "internal" relations in his view that "knowledge or science has to conform, and thus incur genuine relations, to its objects, not vice versa. Only with fictions, which are not cognitions, is the object conformed, related, to thought about it. Knowing is relative to the known, . . . but what in particular is known in a given knowledge is not in its existence relative to this knowl edge" (119b-120a). However, while "we can admit that man is directly aware of something other than just his own mental states . . . the point is, while this non-human reality is actually given as non-human, as something not ourselves which acts upon us, it is not for all that given as nonmental or merely material . . . In the case of an inanimate object (or of microscopic entities, such as single cells), any such psychic character is, if present, not obvious." But "the highly recondite natures of minerals or cells may be of a psychic nature. And, since no alternative nature attributable to them is clearly given directly, we have no positive alternative mode of conceiving the recondite natures of things" (436a). Not only is the object of knowledge psychical or mental in character, in spite of its claimed independence of the</page><page sequence="17">344 FRANCIS H. PARKER knowing mind, but it seems for Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese to be, after all, contained in or identical with a part of that knowing mind. To know a thing is apparently to be that thing or to be characterizable by it, according to this homeocognitive epistemol ogy; and this is not a far cry from the identity of mind and reality which starts with Descartes and culminates in Hegel. "To know something adequately is in the most absolute sense to possess it, and it is then meaningless to say that the known is outside the actual knowing" (177b). This is true, however, only "in the highest sense of knowledge" (19a). "Granted that we do not 'include' mountains when we 'know' them, unless in some very attenuated sense of include, equally we do not know mountains, except in a very attenuated sense of 'know'. . . . Wherever our knowledge achieves something like infallibility, it also becomes evident that it includes the known within itself" (19a); "knowl edge is deficient unless it fully and literally contains its objects" (18b). But is not such mental containment of the object in violation of the independence of the object just proclaimed? One must here "distinguish the truism that the thing known is other than the knowing from the quite different stipulation that the known must be outside the knowing. A constituent of a whole is certainly other than the whole, yet obviously not outside it! But, we shall perhaps be told, the object must not only be other than?it must also be independent of?the knowledge. Suppose this too be granted, why may not parts be independent of the whole containing them?" (18b-19a). This principle of the containment of the object in the knower and of identity with one of its mental states is illustrated time after time in inferences from the fact that a mental state of the knower possesses a certain characteristic to the conclusion that the object known also possesses that characteristic, and vice versa: "If the awareness-of-X is an immutable whole, then X is immutable too" (93a); "nonnecessary events cannot enter into a wholly necessary 'knowing' as its objects" (228a); "could the adequate, full, concrete knowledge of a particular state of suffer ing be anything else than a sympathetic participation in that suffering?" (104a); "the only way to intuit a feeling is to feel it" (196b). This proposition that objects of knowledge are parts</page><page sequence="18">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 345 of the knower and thus have the characteristics of the knower explains, I think, the many arguments which seem to commit the fallacy of composition or division: "if the having-been-of-the-half line9 is fact, then the half-line, which is constituent of this fact, is fact" (96a) ; if "the totality of happenings does not happen" but "just is," "then nothing happens" (92a) ; "a necessary whole can not have contingent parts" (189b), etc. While arguing that parts and wholes must have the same characteristics is, as it stands, a case of the fallacy of composition-division, such argument is not fallacious but tautological if one assumes that it just is the case that parts and wholes have the same characteristics, even though we qualify that assumption by adding that "properties of parts are not necessarily in the same sense properties of their wholes" (161a). But what is the evidence for saying that the objects of knowledge are in fact parts of the knower, and that as parts they must share the characteristics of the knower? The only evidence I can find is that the thing known is an item in the knower's experience: "In the clearest case of direct and certain knowing?thus . . . when we know a color, a sensory quality?it is . . . clear that this quality becomes a determination of our own actuality, our own experience" (27la). But "experience" is here certainly ambi guous; from the fact that the experiencing is part of the knower it does not follow that the experienced is. Obviously and tautologically anything known is part of the knower's experience, but it certainly does not follow from this that the object known is part of the knower's "own actuality"; even one who sees red does not thereby become red. And this cannot be merely because no one experiences red "adequately" save God, for the authors grant that the independence of the experienced from the experiencing is universally true, and hence even of God. Thus Messrs. Hart shorne's and Reese's thesis of the cognitive independence of objects means that objects of knowledge need not be parts of the knower and need not possess the same characteristics as the knower. Hence I can find no other status than that of an "abso lute presupposition" for the authors' doctrine that what is true of thought is true of its objects, is true of reality. 9 Also cited on pp. 338-39 above as an example of argument by hyphenation.</page><page sequence="19">346 FRANCIS H. PARKER One particularly important and striking instance of this pre supposition that what is true of thought is true of reality is the lack of any distinction in Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese between logical and real possibility10?a distinction which Mr. Skutch, in line with both his Kantian and his realistic epistemologies, seems to make (78). For example, Mr. Reese tells us that "since [Alexander's] deity is conceivable, it would seem to be possible," that "a luminous possibility [sc. conceivability] is advanced which, we are then told, is not really possible. But it may be that the 'impossible possibility' which Alexander poses is resoluble even within the context of his careful affirmations" (366a-b). Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese do make a distinction between what is logico-really possible for humans and what is logico-really possible for God (e.g., 509b), but there is no distinction between what is possible in thought per se and what is possible in reality. Another striking and important instance of the presupposi tion that what is true of thought is true of reality is "the Law of Polarity," according to which "ultimate contraries are correl atives, mutually interdependent, so that nothing real can be de scribed [sic] by the wholly one-sided assertion of simplicity, being, actuality, and the like" (2b). Even if we suppose, which is doubtful, that "all thought is by contrast" (117b), it does not follow, without the assumption of "the Law of Polarity," that objective reality possesses these same contrasts. And yet Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese constantly argue as if it does, and their basic doctrine of God depends on this type of argument: since (i/) the contrast between eternity (necessity, etc.) and temporality (contingency, etc.) is absolutely universal in human experience, it must be true of God (15). However, while "all contrasts, according to dipolarity, do fall within God, . . . only really ultimate or categorical contrasts can be used to describe the fixed character of God . . . Now evil, in the sense of wickedness, is not a universal category11 because, "for example, the animals are incapable of it . . . Thus wickedness is not in the divine 10 John Wild made this point in this journal, IV, (September, 1950), p. 63. 11 Mr. Skutch, however, maintains that "good and evil are correlative terms, each inconceivable without the other . . ." (31).</page><page sequence="20">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 347 'character' at all" (15a). The same is true of the contrast be tween creation and destruction: "Destruction is not coordinate with creation," although "for us men, who forget nearly every thing, past values are, it is true, mostly lost" (509b). Here, it is again to be noted, there is a distinction between what is true of men and what is true of God; but there is still no distinction between what is true of thought and what is true of reality. Whatever is true of thought is true of reality and thus of some aspect of God, but only what is universally true of thought is true of the essence or "fixed character" of God. (One wonders whether Messrs. Hartshorne's and Reese's choices of the "cate gorical" or absolutely universal features are not sometimes arbitrary: are eternity, necessity, or creation, for instance, ever present in human thought at all, let alone being absolutely uni versal?) This fundamental presupposition that what is true of thought is true of reality is also at work in Messrs. Hartshorne's and Reese's treatment of the ontological argument as presented by Anselm. The authors regard the argument as passing from the possible to the actual existence of a perfect being; the distinction, which philosophers as different as Aquinas and Kant thought to be the important one, between the conceptual and the extra mentally real existence of a perfect being is not discussed. Granting that it is self-contradictory for a perfect being even pos sibly not to exist, is this fact true of objective reality or only of thought? Thus the philosophical function of the ontological argument as treated by these authors (and probably also by Descartes) is to reassure themselves that what is true of thought is true of reality. The authors have saved Anselm's argument by destroying it, by changing the conclusion. "What a triumph for Anselm?even though one which might have surprised and troubled him!" (105b). Anselm argued for an extra-mental, non logical individual; Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese argue for a logical universal. Since all the criticisms of the argument were against concluding extra-mental individuality, of course the authors by-pass these criticisms. But what have they proved? That there must be, at any time, some state of affairs greater than anv other. But this could be a different state of affairs from one</page><page sequence="21">348 FRANCIS H. PARKER moment to the next, and it could be a mental idea of such a greatest state of affairs with no corresponding objective reality. (Ill) Thus the basic presupposition of the philosophico-religious speculation of panentheism, especially in Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese but also in Mr. Skutch, appears to be that whatever is true of thought is true of reality. But since they argue to God from heart as well as from head, from emotional as well as intellectual experience, this presupposition may now be seen to possess the more general form that whatever is true of human experience, both intellectual and emotional, is also true of objective reality and of God. And this presupposition seems to me to account for the basic difference between the God of panentheism and that of its main opponent, classical theism. The God of panentheism is relative to the world as well as absolute and independent of the world, and therefore also contingent, temporal, and complex as well as necessary, eternal, and simple. The God of classical theism, on the other hand, is purely actual, necessary, absolute, non-relative, and non-temporal. One is tempted to conclude that this disagreement is entirely verbal. Both theories maintain that reality contains both an abso lute, independent, eternal, and necessary factor and also a relative, dependent, temporal, and contingent factor. "Classical theism has the great merit that . . . There is . . . Something immutable with all mutable things really outside it," Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese admit; "... The classical deity does have a world to know and to act upon" (176b-177a). What panentheism calls the relative, etc., pole of God, classical theism calls the world,12 and what panentheism calls God, classical theism calls reality. Indeed, in many, many places in the book the word "reality" could be 12 Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese do make a distinction between "world" and the relative pole of God, but I find this distinction very unclear. For example on p. 514b: "... the superrelative is the many as also one, or the one as also many. The world as not God is the many merely as many . . ." But the many as many cannot have a singular name, "world." Hence there seems to be no world distinct from God.</page><page sequence="22">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 349 substituted for the word "God" with no change in meaning what soever. Here Mr. Skutch's terminology seems preferable to that of Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese, for the former refers to the relative, contingent factor as "the Divine" in contradistinction to "God," "deity," or "Primal Substance or Cosmic Ground" (208). Indeed, it strikes me that this issue between classical theism and panentheism is one to which the famous passage from the conclu sion of Hume's Dialogues (quoted on 432b-433a) might apply, mutatis mutandis, as well as it does to the issue Hume was treat ing: "I ask the" panentheist "if he does not allow that there is" in reality an absoluteness, necessity, and independence radically distinct from everything relative, contingent, and dependent: "The more pious he is, the more readily will he assent . . . and the more will he be disposed to magnify the difference ... I next turn to the" classical theist "and I ask him, whether" there is not also relativity, contingency, and temporality: "He will readily acknowl edge it . . . Where then, cry I to both these antagonists, is the subject of your dispute?" And so far as the choice of words is concerned, granting that it is arbitrary, I must agree with Schopenhauer (quoted on 441b) : "To call the world God is not to explain it, but only to enrich language with a superfluous synonym of the word 'world.' Whether . . . 'the world is God,' or 'the world is the world,' comes to the same thing." Yet this conclusion that the issue is wholly verbal would not be entirely correct, I believe. Reflection upon the question of the order of priority of these two factors indicates that there is here a genuine and basic disagreement between panentheism and classical theism. While both theories recognize both factors, the necessary and the contingent, they disagree on the question which of these two factors is prior or more fundamental. The view of classical theism is that the absolute factor is prior ontologically and that the relative factor is prior epistemologically. The purely necessary and absolute (God) is "first in the order of being and last in the order of knowing," and the contingent and relative (the world) is first in the order of knowing and last in the order of being. From the world we come to know God, but God is the source of the being of the world. Mr. Skutch certainly seems to agree with this ontological priority and epistemological posteriority of the abso</page><page sequence="23">350 FRANCIS H. PARKER lute: "Beyond the phenomenal world revealed to our senses lies only the Primal Substance, . . . the transcendent ground of all we know and can conceive" (99). God is "primary" (112) and is like a "hermit" who "will never take . . . reward of any kind" and who "helps from the fullness of his love and spiritual strength, not because he needs anything ... he gives much but receives nothing" (75). But this absolute ground "we can know . . . only by what he does, never by what he is" (129). Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese do not agree, however, although it is hard to tell which of two disagreeing views they actually hold. Their official doctrine seems to be that neither of the two factors is prior to the other, that they are correlative and coordi nate. Indeed, this seems to be entailed by their (previously dis cussed) "Law of Polarity." The idea that one pole must be prior to the other would seem to "embody the monopolar prejudice," for "prior to both potentiality and actuality [contingency and necessity, etc.], according to the Law of Polarity, is the tension between them; their union in a process which is neither simply actual nor simply potential" (14a). In spite of the fact that this is their official doctrine, however, in spite of "the conviction . . . already expressed many times that monopolar doctrines are always irrational, that the law of polarity to which dipolar theism appeals is a supreme law of rational understanding" (293a), many pas sages suggest a favoring of one of the two poles?the pole, as should be expected, of relativity.13 "Assume possibility and neces sity is an abstract identity common to all possibilities; assume free creativeness, and causality can be understood as the relevance of an act of creating to the already created . . .; assume relativity and the absolute can be deduced as an aspect thereof. But if we start with the absolute, necessary, and merely unitary, then no 13 Some few other passages, however, seem to suggest that the pole of absoluteness is ontologically prior to the pole of relativity: "The absolute . . . factor in God ... is the pure cause which neither is nor contains any effect; the unmoved mover . . ." (514a). ". . . the absolute is the pre cosmic nature of God..." (310a). Further, Whitehead's expressions "primordial" and "consequent" natures of God seem to suggest this priority, and the authors seem to approve of these expressions (357b). Such passages as these when taken in conjunction with the passages favoring relativity would seem to support the view that the two poles are coordinate.</page><page sequence="24">HEAD, HEART, AND GOD 351 relations, potentialities, process, can ever be deduced or derived" (293a-b). Again, "... the relative, according to sur relativism, includes the absolute, as the concrete the abstract, so that to say that the absolute is in any sense more than the relative is to say that x is more than xy" (310b). Again: "... that a man can only act according to his nature, his being or essence, is a clear instance of the monopolar prejudice that being is prior to becoming. According to this view, we derive action from nature, becoming from being. We do not, in fact. A man's 'nature' is a cross-section of his acting and not something with prior status. It is an explanation after the fact, an abstract of the concrete reality which is process, and never more than mere being or essence" (444a). In short, "... becoming is the more inclusive category" (9a). One might of course interpret these and other like passages as asserting only the epistemological and not the existential priority of the factor of relativity over that of absolute ness. Such epistemological priority does clearly seem to be a thesis held by Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese?in spite of their conten tion that "a merely 'empirical theology' is a contradiction in terms" and that the proofs for the existence of God "are all a priori; proofs from principles or categories, not from facts" (14a), for such principles or categories and "at last all reasons reduce in some sense to experience" (3b). Yet the priority of the pole of relativity expressed in these and other passages seems rather to be a complete priority in every respect, ontological as well as episte mological; the deduction or derivation of the absolute from the relative seems to be an existential as well as a cognitive one. No matter which of these two alternative interpretations, which mode of disagreement with classical theism, is intended by Messrs. Hartshorne and Reese, however?whether relativity is coordinate with or existentially as well as epistemologically prior to absoluteness?both doctrines are, it seems to me, traceable to the same basic presupposition: that what is true of thought is true of reality. The alternative that the two factors are coordinate is entailed by the authors' "Law of Polarity," and this "law" is established, as shown above, on the basis that what is true of thought is true of reality: "all thought is by contrast." And the other alternative interpretation, that relativity is existentially</page><page sequence="25">352 FRANCIS H. PARKER prior to absoluteness, is also traceable to the same presupposition. For the view that contingent, relative, temporal facts about the world come first in the order of knowing and that it is from these that our categories and principles, and hence our conception of God, are formed is, as has been noted, held by panentheism as well as by classical theism?and, I should suppose, by most con temporary philosophers. But classical theism lacks the pre supposition that what is true of thought is true of reality and thus concludes that while the relative is first in thought it is last in reality. Panentheism, however, involves this presupposition, if I am correct, and thus holds that the relative is first in reality since it is first in thought. But human thought is not merely rational and ratiocinative; it is also affective and emotional. And so what is true of human emotion, as well as of human reason, is also, when extended to its extreme "categorical supercase," true of God. Thus are the God of the head and the God of the heart united in the one dipolar Deity of panentheism. Whether the relative factor be prior to or coordinate with the absolute factor, therefore, the panentheist view of a dipolar God, in contrast to the classical theist view of a monopolar God, seems to be a final and most basic instance of the presupposition that what is true of human thought and experience, intellectual and emotional, must also be true of objective reality and of God.
