<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sociobiology and Behavior. David P. Barash. 378 pp. Elsevier North-Hol land, 1977. $9.95 cloth, $4.95 paper. Barash states in the preface that "so ciobiology is a whole new way of looking at behavior." He explicates: "It is the application of evolutionary biology to social behavior, an approach that has proven successful in animal studies and that may hold promise for a greater un derstanding of human behavior as well." The application of evolutionary concepts to social behavior is not strictly new? already Darwin and other "classics" had done a fair amount of it. New, however, are the identification of sociobiology as a unified branch of science and the at tempts to formulate a coherent synthesis of the existing knowledge. E. O. Wilson's Sociobiology: The New Synthesis is the landmark from which the new counting starts. Barash's book is well written, and it is a fair introduction to the central topics of sociobiology. The achievements of socio biology are by now substantial; as a field of study it is here to stay in spite of some critics. But not all the criticisms are without merit. Less acidulous critics have pointed out, for example, the dangers of anthropomorphic language applied to nonhuman animals and of unsound ex trapolation from animal behavior to human behavior. Barash sins on both counts to the detriment of this belea guered branch of science. Committed critics of sociobiology will find plenty of ammunition here; unbiased readers may take the book's defects as sociobiology's failings. Barash uses language loosely and abuses anthropomorphisms. For example, "selfish" is repeatedly predicated from biological processes and entities, as in "the ultimate selfishness of natural se lection causes." Even evolutionary biology is said to be selfish. Other anthropomor phisms are "adultery," "rape," "personal fitness," "cuckoldry," "deceit," "igno rance," and many others. Unwarranted extrapolation from animal to human be havior is common. Two examples: "So ciobiology accordingly predicts, for ex ample, that divorce or its equivalent cor relates closely with any substantial dec rement to successful reproduction," and "assuming once again that human be havior has evolved to maximize individual fitness" (my italics). 1978 July-August 497</page><page sequence="2">Faulty logic, particularly in the form of special pleading, pervades the reasoning. For example, we are told that "children should therefore be selected to demand more parental investment than the par ents will be selected to give" and that "offspring would lose fitness if they were too selfish." Barash adds that this line of reasoning suggests many interesting predictions. In fact, any state of affairs can be explained away with two premises that tell us, one, that there should be sel fishness and, two, that there should not be too much of it. Barash grandiosely proclaims "the central theorem of sociobiology": "When any behavior under study reflects some component of genotype, animals should behave so as to maximize their inclusive fitness." The theorem becomes Barash's version of Aladdin's magic lamp. It is ap plied, for example, not only to explain harems made of only one male and many females in labrid fish but also to account for breeding troops with several males and females as well as for monogamous pairs. The "explanation" consists of claiming that in each case the particular breeding structure maximizes fitness, because otherwise it would not have become es tablished by natural selection. This is petitio principii at its most flagrant. One difficulty with sociobiology is that genuine empirical corroboration is often lacking. The situation is not, however, as bad as it would appear from this book, in which I cannot recall the presence of even one table with empirical data. Barash brandishes the central theorem of socio biology and verbally explains away every behavior pattern. Sociobiology should do, and can do, better than that.?Francisco J.
