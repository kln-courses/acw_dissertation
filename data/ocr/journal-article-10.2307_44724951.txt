Melvin Bioengineering Center, Wayne State University Copyright © 2004 SAE International ABSTRACT The objective of this work was to evaluate a new tool for assessing brain injury. Many race car drivers have suffered concussion and other brain injuries and are in need of ways of evaluating better head protective systems and equipment. Current assessment guidelines such as HIC may not be adequate for assessing ail scenarios. Finite element models of the brain have the potential to provide much better injury prediction for any scenario. At a previous Motorsports conference, results of a MADYMO model of a racing car and driver driven by 3-D accelerations recorded in actual crashes were presented. Model results from nine cases, some with concussion and some not, yielded head accelerations that were used to drive the Wayne State University Head Injury Model (WSUHIM). This model consists of over 310,000 elements and is capable of simulating direct and indirect impacts. It has been extensively validated using published cadaveric test data. Results show high strain and strain rates as a primary cause of concussion sustained by race car drivers. Such a tool can be used to better evaluate head protection devices and systems for race car drivers as well as other incidents involving potential brain injury. INTRODUCTION An important factor in the design and development of vehicle occupant crash protection is an understanding of the tolerance of the human body to impact forces. Research on this topic began in the 1950s with human volunteers and animals studied by Col. John P. Stapp (USAF) and with the use of cadavers at Wayne State University (WSU). The problem of testing the "real thing" to find what level of forces can be withstood under typical severe highway crashes has persisted. The response of volunteers in low-g tests or human surrogates at high-g environments has left questions as to the tolerances of living humans in high severity crashes. An understanding of the crash forces and injury outcomes sustained by the race car driver may benefit the design of future passenger vehicles after transforming the knowledge from the race car to the passenger car setting. This requires careful investigation and study to discern the basic principles that can be obtained from such information. This study represents one step in that process. Application of this knowledge to passenger cars may not only affect vehicle design, but also crash-test dummy design, injury criteria, and regulations. Starting in 1992, the GM Motorsports Safety Technology Research Program began to enhance the collection of race car crash data and apply crash protection research methods to improve the safety of race car drivers. The program focussed on Indy-type race car crashes. Starting in 1993, onboard impact recorder was used to accurately measure vehicle crash deceleration (Melvin et al., 1994). Since 1994, the recorder has been installed in every Indy- type race car at every race. These crashes provided an almost laboratory-like setting due to the similarity of the cars and relative simplicity of the crashes (mostly planar crashes of single cars against an oval track wall or a road course barrier). 1230</page><page sequence="2">The anthropometry of Indy car drivers was documented in 1994 (Andrzejak, et al, 1994). The average Indy car driver is similar to the 50th percentile male of the general population. The age of the drivers ranged from 25 to 50 with an average of 34 years. Advantages of these crash investigations are that the car drivers are well defined and the crash location is limited to 20 or so racetracks. Also, the vehicle pre-crash trajectory and impact conditions can often be determined from video coverage of the event. Response of emergency crews is very rapid. There is no question about driver position and restraint use during the crash. In 1998, an analysis of 202 cases with peak decelerations above 20 g was reported by Melvin et al (1998). The mean peak chassis deceleration was 53 g. Peak decelerations greater than 60 g (some up to 127 g) have been recorded for significant duration in many frontal, side and rear impacts. The mean total velocity change was 45.5 KPH (28.3 mph), with some as high as 97 - 113 KPH (60 - 70 mph). Only 13 crashes were classified as frontal and 46 cases were classified as rear impacts. The remaining 143 crashes were classified as side impacts. In most of the analyzed crashes, there were no injuries to the drivers. In some cases there were some head injuries and a few lower extremity injuries. In no cases were there any chest or torso injuries requiring medical intervention. One of the more frequent injuries are closed head injuries. A previous study (Begeman, 2002) reported the results of a mathematical model of selected race car crashes to assess some injury parameters. Predicted head accelerations and HIC values were analyzed to correlate with the injury occurrence. However, the data show tolerance exposures well beyond the safety standard and proposed limits for brain injury. With the advance in computer technology and availability of cadaveric test data, computer models are now capable of simulating fine anatomical detail and tissue-level characteristics for impacts leading to injury (King et al. 2003). Finite element (FE) models of the brain have been assisting researchers' on defining injury mechanisms for brain contusion, subdural hematomas, brain deformation and diffuse axonal injury (DAI) (Ward et al. 1980; Trosseille et al. 1992; Chu et al. 1994; Eppinger 1999; Huang et al 1999; Mendis et al. 1995; Ueno et al. 1995; Ruan 1995; Zhou et al. 1995; Willinger et al. 1999). However, there has been limited FE analysis of concussive brain injury and its tolerance limits. The Wayne State University Head Injury Model (WSUHIM) Version 2001 is the most sophisticated FE model of the human head (Zhang et al. 2001b). It features fine anatomical details including the scalp, skull with an outer table, diploë, and inner table, dura, falx cerebri, tentorium, pia, sagittal sinus, transverse sinus, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), hemispheres of the cerebrum with distinct white and gray matter, cerebellum, brainstem, lateral ventricles, third ventricles, and bridging veins. The facial model consists of facial bones, nasal cartilage, temporal mandibular joint, ligaments, soft tissue and skin. The whole model is made up of over 310,000 elements and uses 15 different material properties for various tissues of the head as shown in Figure 1. It has been subjected to rigorous validation against available cadaveric intracranial and ventricular pressure data, the relative displacement data between the brain and the skull, and facial impact data (Zhang et al. 2001b). Figure 1: Finite element model of a human head (WSUHIM) A validated FE model along with tissue tolerance data can offer a means of identifying and quantifying the risks for concussion. Recently, the WSUHIM was utilized to study the concussion using on-field accident data obtained from the National Football Leagues. Brain-tissue responses were correlated to sites of injury related to the signs and symptoms of concussion. Statistical analysis was conducted to determine initial concussion predictors and estimates of 1231</page><page sequence="3">injury probability. The study suggested that underlying cause for neural tissue injury can be explained better by tissue response variables predominately by product of strain and strain rate, instead of head acceleration input (Zhang et al. 2003, Zhang et al. 2004, King et al. 2003). In this study, the WSUHIM was used to replicate the head injuries using results of previous study as input to the model. The goal is to correlate biomechanical tissue responses predicted by the model to brain injuries sustained by drivers in race car exposure. These response variables including intracranial pressure, strain, strain rate and the product of strain and strain rate, were determined and compared between injury and non-injury cases. It is hoped that once more data become available, findings derived from such effort will help to advance our understanding of biomechanical mechanisms of traumatic brain injury. METHODS In order to predict the response of the race car driver in these crashes for the present study, a mathematical model was used. The basic model was previously developed at Ford (Weerappuli et al. 1998) and has been modified to fit the crashes and particular car geometry for this study. MADYM03D Version 5.4 was used for the model. Input to the model was the actual crash recording data. Details of the model and results are described in the previous paper (Begeman and Melvin 2002). Nine cases were selected for this study. Their crash types, severities and outcomes, are summarized in Table 1. Head acceleration results from the previous paper are summarized in Table 2. The nine cases, four with brain injuries and five without brain injury, were simulated using the WSUHIM. Histories of the three translational and three rotational acceleration components at the center of the gravity (eg) of the head were used as input to the model. These accelerations define the motion of the head eg and they were transferred to the skull boundary nodes to load the brain in a manner identical to the motion of the Hybrid III dummy model in the accident reconstruction. The face, scalp and three-layer skull were assume to be rigid bodies to reduce computational time, since skull accelerations were the means to load the brain. Typical head impact durations for both injury and non-injury cases were about 60 - 80 ms. The calculations were extended an additional 5 ms beyond the duration of the acceleration pulse to ensure that the viscoelastic response of the brain was fully accounted for. The response parameters monitored by the model included the intracranial pressure, first principal strain, first principal strain rate and the calculated product of strain and strain rate. A nonlinear explicit finite element solver PAM-CRASH™ Version 2001 (ESI Group, Paris, France) was used for analysis. The results were plotted using an interactive graphics post-processor PAM-VIEW™ Version 2002 (ESI, Paris, France).

The reported maximum response values including the intracranial pressure, first principal strain, strain rate and product of strain and strain rate were based on an average value of six selected elements that have the highest values. The location of each biomechanical response parameter was also reported to correlate brain injury sites. INTRACRANIAL PRESSURE The intracranial pressure pattern predicted by the model formed a typical coup and contrecoup phenomenon. The terms coup and contrecoup refer to injury locations occurred on the impact site and on the opposite site of the impact, respectively. Figure 2 shows the top view of the intracranial pressure gradients across the entire brain predicted at the time when maximum pressure occurred (Case PPK97). For all cases simulated, the wave propagation direction showed correlation with the direction of translational acceleration of the eg of the head. For case PPK97 (rear crash) as depicted in Figure 2, the driver's occipital lobe on the right side of the brain sustained the highest compressive pressure (252 kPa) whereas the left frontal lobe experienced the highest negative pressure (197 kPa). For the four injury cases, the predicted peak positive pressure (compressive pressure) ranged from 96 to 262 kPa while the peak negative pressure varied from -28 to -197 kPa. For the five non-injury cases, the peak positive and negative pressures respectively ranged from 40 to 149 kPa and from -43 to -139 kPa. Both coup and contrecoup pressures developed immediately after the linear acceleration reached its peak. Figure 2: Top view of the intracranial pressure wave predicted for case PPK97. FIRST PRINCIPAL STRAIN/STRAIN RATE RESPONSE The highest first principal strain predicted by model ranged from 0.58 to 0.77 with an average of 0.68 for injury cases. As for the non-injury cases, the first principal strain ranged from 0.25 to 0.70 with an average value of 0.38. The high strain responses for injury cases were obtained at the midbrain, thalamus, and parahippocampal gyri regions depending on impact condition. In cases of non-injury, the peak strains also occurred at parietal and occipital cortex but with much lower magnitudes. The first principal strain rate (ds/dt) was computed at the elements that also experienced high strains. The predicted strain rate for brain 1233</page><page sequence="5">injury cases varied from 172 to 338 s"1 with an average value of 259 s"1 for injury cases and from 65 to 198 s"1 with an average value of 107 s"1 for non-injury cases. The product of strain and strain rate (e de/dt) is another local tissue response measure that could be a mechanical parameter for neural injury. This product was computed by taking the product of the instantaneous strain and strain rate over the period of simulation. For injury cases, the average sde/dt calculated at the midbrain, thalamus, and parahippocampal gyrus was around 124 s"1 while as for non-injury cases, the average s de/dt was 82 s'1. Figure 3: Predicted first principal strain s, strain rate de/dt and calculated product of strain and strain rate cde/dt time histories for case IND14. Figure 3 shows the predicted first principal strain, first principal strain rate and calculated product of strain and strain rate time histories at parahippocampal gyrus for case IND14. Strain rate response curves reached its peak several milliseconds before the peak strain. For most cases the peak strain occurred at the time when the rotational acceleration reached its peak, while the peak stain rate tended to occur earlier, usually between the time of peak linear and angular accelerations. INJURY LOCALIZATION The locations of high strain or strain rate predicted by the model were identified in the brain in an attempt to correlate the localized brain response to sites of brain injuries. In order to visualize the localized response "hot spots" only the elements experiencing the strain above a preset level was shown. Figure 4 shows the "hot spots" predicted for cases IND14 and IND97. The threshold for concussive brain injury based on first principal strain was set at 35% according to a study based on NFL concussion data. For all injury cases, high first principal strain and strain rate were typically concentrated at the central core region of the brain, more specifically, located in the midbrain, and most of the diencephalon, and parahippocampal gyrus. Figure 4: The localized "hot spot" for first principal strain predicted at the parahippocampal and midbrain for case of left side impact IND14 (upper images) and at the midbrain for case of right front impact IND97 (lower images). 1234</page><page sequence="6">DISCUSSION IMPACT RESPONSE Rear Impacts - The rear impact cases provide the best estimates of the driver loading because of the proximity of the head padding to the head and the immediate restraint of the rigid form- fitting seat used in these cars. These features allow the MADYMO model of the Hybrid III dummy to interact most appropriately for this condition. The first two rear impact cases (PPK97 and PHX99) are quite significant in that they involved the same driver. PPK97 was the first of the two crashes. The driver suffered a subdural hematoma and loss of consciousness and was hospitalized. He resumed racing the following season. The crash severity was 66 g, but the head padding was subsequently determined to be inadequate both in material properties and in shape. The padding was also placed too low in the car relative to the driver's head. The pad exhibited poor energy absorption in laboratory tests and was wedge-shaped with the thicker portion above and tapered down to relatively little padding at its lower portion. This produced a differential stiffness pad that promoted head rotation in a rear impact and was judged to be the cause of the driver's brain injuries in this crash. The PHX99 crash was a year and a half later and involved a car with a properly placed head pad of rectangular shape and good energy absorbing properties. In this 90 g crash the driver sustained no injuries and climbed out of the car on his own. There were no significant changes in helmet design between the two crashes. Interestingly, Tables 1 and 2 show that although the second crash produced lower head accelerations the HIC values were similar. The significant difference was the reduction of head angular accelerations by 46% in the second crash. All of the four rear impact cases were severe crashes. The latter three crashes produced no head or neck injury and yet, did produce high HIC values, well above the Injury Assessment Reference Value (IARV) of 1000. It would appear that head angular acceleration might be more indicative of head injury potential in these crashes. The three crashes with no head injury produced angular acceleration values below the 16,000 rad/s limit estimated by Margulies et al (1990) for mild to moderate diffuse axonal injuries. Side Impacts - The side impacts studied here were all very severe crashes. The head accelerations and HIC values were similar to those in the rear impacts but two of the drivers were concussed. This may be indicative of a lower tolerance of the head in lateral impact when compared to front/rear impact, a fact noted in animal, cadaver impact studies, and our FE modeling reported previously (Zhang et al. 2001a). However, more data are needed to confirm the directional sensitivity of head to brain injury in race car exposure. Front Impacts - The two frontal impacts were also severe crashes. The head accelerations of the injured case had a high lateral component. This again may be indicative of a lower tolerance to lateral impacts. BRAIN RESPONSE Although HIC has been used by the automobile industry for over 30 years, with a moderate degree of success, it really does not tell us what is happening to the brain. Results from our previous analyses suggested a poor correlation between HIC levels and head injury occurrence. Neural tissues are viscoelastic and are vulnerable to the rate at which the strain is applied. In vitro studies on individual axon or cell have revealed that axonal dysfunction or the extent of cellular damage is a function of strain and rate (Galbraith et al. 1993; LaPlaca et al. 1997). Some animal test data have demonstrated that brain tissue injury depends on the strain rate and the product of strain and strain rate (Viano and Lovsund 1999). Recently an in-depth analysis of NFL mild traumatic brain injury data has shown the predictive power of localized strain rate and product of strain and strain rate induced in the brain tissue (Zhang et al. 2003, King et al. 2003). In addition, their data have shown a promising correlation between response parameters and clinical signs and symptoms exhibited by the injured players. The race car data like the NFL data, is unique and new scientific information on human tolerance. By using these data, the new injury parameters were further studies to explain causal mechanisms for concussive brain injures sustained by race car drivers. 1235</page><page sequence="7">Among four injured cases simulated, of which three sustained cerebral concussion and one suffered subdural hematoma and loss of consciousness, the model predicted the highest strain and strain rate at the midbrain, thalamus, parahippocampal gyri regions as compared to other regions of the brain. These anatomical structures are important functional units closely associated with cognition, memory, nerve pathways (cranial nerves) to the cerebral hemispheres and the state of consciousness. The model predicted higher strains/strain rates in these regions than other parts of the brain, suggesting that alteration in cerebral function is directly caused by tissue distortion or the rate of tissue distortion when the severity of such responses exceeds the tolerance level. For case PPK97, the orbital gyri (gray matter) at the left temporal tips also experienced a high strain (0.66) but less than that of the midbrain (0.75) which occurred about 5 ms later. It was likely that the blood vessels at this region might be over stretched or torn, resulting in subdural hematoma. However, the biomechanical parameter responsible for subdural hematoma couldn't be ascertained from current simulation because the location of the hematoma was not available at this point. Figure 5: The localized first principal strain predicted at the orbital gyrus near the left temporal tip for case PPK97 (only the elements having the strain between 0.36 to 0.66 are shown). Analyses of the intracranial pressure sustained by these drivers showed that the magnitudes experienced by injured drivers were significantly higher than those by non-injured drivers. In 1980, Ward et al. proposed an intracranial pressure tolerance criterion stating that serious brain injury would occur when the peak intracranial pressure exceeded 235 kPa, while minor or no brain injuries would occur when the resulting intracranial pressure was below 173 kPa. For cases PPK97 and IND97, the peak intracranial pressure exceeded 235 kPa and none of them sustained serious contusive brain injury but concussive brain injury and subdural hematoma. In addition, the high pressure was commonly located at the surface of the brain rather in the deep structure where the anatomical structures are believed to maintain the state of consciousness. These observations imply that the intracranial pressure response alone may not be adequate to determine the underlying cause of brain concussion. However, overall high pressure gradients (shock wave) across the brain remains to be an important indicator of the overall severity of the brain trauma in injured drivers. Perhaps such pressure wave at severe impact condition adds further damage to the brain that is caused primary by local strain/strain rate exceeding the tissue threshold. However, before any breakthrough for a new injury predictor/criterion can be determined, more data collected from race car field, along with a suitable material model defined for brain tissue properties are needed. The brain model simulations were driven by the head accelerations as derived from MADYMO simulations using crash recorded data. The MADYMO model used a Hybrid III dummy as the occupant, which has some limitations in lateral and frontal crashes in this setting. When ear accelerometer data becomes available and validated and is coupled with human models, improved brain model injury assessments can be attained eventually. CONCLUSIONS This study has used mathematical modeling of driver kinematics in instrumented racing car crashes to estimate the driver responses and loading in severe rear, side and frontal impacts. The results indicate that the HIC IARV level of 1000 may not be an effective predictor of head injury and that consideration of combined linear and angular acceleration levels is necessary to assess injury potential. A combined study using race car field impact data and our validated FE head model yielded preliminary findings that shed insight into the causal mechanism of concussive brain injures. Based upon these results, the following conclusions can be reached: 1236</page><page sequence="8">• The localized high first principal strain and strain rate are proposed as a primary cause for concussive brain injury • Intracranial pressure gradient alone is inadequate to explain the cause of concussive or focal brain injuries • However, it is postulated that at severe impact condition, induced high intracranial pressure gradient across the brain may compromise brain injury severity that is induced primary by localized tissue deformation/deformation rate • To study injury mechanisms, it is best to focus on brain reaction to complex inputs of combined translational and rotational accelerations instead of head kinematics or HIC • The inevitable conclusion is that, if we are to define tolerance in terms of brain response, we will need a FE model to describe this response. Intelligent helmet design will also need such a computer model for omni-directional protection in motor sports. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This study was supported, in part, by GM Racing. REFERENCES 1.
