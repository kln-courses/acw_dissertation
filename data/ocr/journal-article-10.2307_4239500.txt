<plain_text><page sequence="1">STAPLEDON'S "AGNOSTIC MYSTICISM" 249 Robert Branham Stapledon's "Agnostic Mysticism" The history of the human race is replete with the tales of visionaries who have sought, with varying degrees of success, to convey some meaningful aspect of their experiences to others.' Our cultural and mythical heritage, as Joseph Campbell has observed, is largely a "history of the pouring of blazing visions into the minds of seers and the efforts of earthly communities to incarnate unearthly covenants."2 The creation and communication of myths adequate to this task have become progressively difficult and, as a result, increasingly valuable. The works of Olaf Stapledon offer a chronicle of personal struggle with revelation and expression. His non-fictional works describe both the importance of spiritual vision for personal and social development and the utter impossibility of adequately conceptualizing or expressing the substance of these perceptions. Stapledon's fictions feature a staggering array of visionary experiences, including a confrontation with the Star Maker, a cosmic view of human history over a span of two billion years, and an exploration of spirit and mind among a cast of characters that includes stars, nebulae, dogs, flames, and the cosmos itself. The uniqueness of Stapledon's fiction lies not simply in the grandeur of his visions, but also in his development of a literary style that enforces a certain attitude toward these insights. Stapledon's simultaneously held beliefs regarding the importance of spiritual discovery and the complete unreliability of attempts to describe its nature or meaning led him to adopt an outlook he termed "agnostic mysticism." This twinning of vision and skepticism also characterizes the rhetorical stance of his fiction, mythic constructions that are heavily qualified and are masterpieces of indirection. Through his fiction, Stapledon sought to refine his personal vision, communicate some aspect of it to others, and yet maintain the sense of mystery that inspired and sustained his spiritual quest. 1. Stapledon's views on mysticism informed and directed his fictional construc- tions. In Stapledon's universe, perhaps best described in Star Maker, all sen- tient beings are devoted to the pursuit of spiritual development, or "Light." The basis of this pursuit is mystical enlightenment, a "special kind of non- rational experience," according to Philosophy and Living, "in which, it is claimed, the individual attains some degree of illumination or insight into the essential and normally hidden nature of reality." This insight, as explained in Philosophy and Living, is non-intellectual; a blend of knowledge, feeling, and striving that is neither distanced nor abstract, but "concrete, like sense experience" (PL, p. 414). Stapledon believed the sources of mystic vision to be both diverse and common, so that "almost any kind of object may afford the stimulus for this mood of ecstasy, or on the other hand may never do so" (Ethics, p. 247). The insights afforded by such ecstasy are inherently limited. Stapledon viewed mysticism as incapable of producing either substantive knowledge of the "Star Maker" or of an occult "reality behind 'appearances."' In Philosophy</page><page sequence="2">250 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 9 (1982) and Living he explains that vision is not a discovery of a hidden reality, but of a new sense of "rightness" about the normally experienced world. "Mystical experience," he concludes, "constitutes essentially a new or more awakened way of feeling about the world" (p. 424). While this feeling is too vague to justify dogma, it is, according to Stapledon, the essential component of spiritual development, moral action, and social harmony. Stapledon's fictional works amply demonstrate the limitations of human enlightenment. In Darkness and the Light he describes a world dedicated to the union of human spirit with a vaster spiritual reality. After attaining some degree of personal and racial development in spiritual experience, man pries open "the locked door of mystery. .. only to glimpse an incomprehensible horror and to fall back in dismay" (10:162). In Star Maker the collective consciousness of the cosmos spreads "the poor wings of lits] spirit to soar up to him, only to be blinded and seared and struck down" (13:409). Stapledon believed that although all "partially awakened beings" are compelled to seek an understanding of the "torrent" of existence, "the torrent's course is utterly beyond our comprehension... its significance escapes our minds, transcends our hearts" (OE, p. 24). Moreover, the insights obtained are momentary, insubstantial, and unrecallable. Even the Last Men, in the apogee of human spiritual and cognitive development, are unable to recall the limited vision obtained in the "Racial Mentality" when they re-emerge as individuals. They can neither "recapture that far-seeing vision" nor "clearly remember what it was that [they] experienced" (LFM, 15:227, 226). When Sirius reflects upon his brief mystical revelation, he finds its substance is lost "save for its afterglow in [his] mind" (Sirius, 9:248). In The Opening of the Eyes the narrator acknowledges with remorse that "now the vision is past. Memory can but wanly picture it. The intoxication is over" (p. 21). This phenomenon is a common feature of our own experience. We may, for example, remember events of our early childhood, but we cannot now experience them (even in recollection) as the children we once were. Stapledon's characters face even greater difficulties because they attempt to recall the experiences of a consciousness more developed and complex than that possessed at the time of narration. Stapledon's novels provide a record of the attempts by humans and other sentient beings to hear the music of the spheres and glimpse its composer. His characters and races pursue an evolutionary development of spiritual acuity, trying desperately to discern a melody but never able to catch more than a few disconnected notes. Whatever the mystic's pretensions to knowledge, Stapledon believed that, like the narrator of Star Maker, he is in possession of "no more than a few shreds of truth, and these not literal but symbolic" (5:300). Stapledon also voiced strong reservations about the ability of visionaries to express what few shreds of truth they possess. Ineffability has long been regarded as the definitive characteristic of mysticism, a sardonic reminder that those who have the most to tell us are among the least likely to accomplish the task. For Stapledon, the cruel irony of enlightenment rests in this double gift of inspirational clarity and verbal confusion. "In general the ecstatic experience, which is the mystic's supreme reward, it said to give profound insight into the essential nature of reality, along with a stammering inability to describe what has been revealed, save in the most metaphorical and paradoxical terms" (PL, p. 418). Like the builders of Babel, those who would rise to see the cosmos are cursed with incommunicability. It is small wonder that those who have glimpsed "something of overwhelming majesty and beauty which completely defeated their powers of description" are compelled to interpret their experience</page><page sequence="3">STAPLEDON'S "AGNOSTIC MYSTICISM" 251 in terms of their traditional culture and religious beliefs (PL, p. 32). Stapledon was himself tempted by the power of traditional myths. The Opening of the Eyes is an intimate account of his spiritual quest and of his struggles with conceptualization and communication. Much of the text is presented in dialogue with the various conceptualizations of the supreme being imagined by Stapledon during his lifetime. The narrator dismisses each image in turn as "mere high-sounding, meaningless noise" (p. 20). The traditional myths could neither give shape to his experiences nor help convey them to others. Beyond their failure to concretize his spiritual vision, language and intellection were thought by Stapledon to actively mislead those foolish enough to rely upon them. "Everything that I can say of you," laments the narrator of Opening of the Eyes, "is fatally false to you, false even to my own faint glimmer of you" (p. 26). When embodied in doctrine, these mis- representations create forceful but confused and potentially dangerous superstitions (PL, p. 232). It is for this reason that Stapledon believed all verbal renderings of mystical experience should be regarded with "great suspicion" (PL, p. 421). Stapledon prized the unique insights of mystical vision but sought to keep a skeptical distance; refraining from firm commitment to literal, symbolic, or mythic interpretations. In Old Man in New World Stapledon advanced the term "agnostic mysticism" to suggest the paradoxical quality of his persisting vision. 2. Stapledon's reservations about language were coupled with powerful motives to communicate. Those experiences grand and unique enough to defy description are precisely those we are most anxious to share with others. The narrator of Last and First Men describes the artistic compulsion of the First Men "to fashion some perceptible embodiment of the vanished splendour" presented by their mystical experiences (15:227). Although Stapledon also sought to recapture and refine his vision, his desire to communicate was more than a quest for personal understanding; it was motivated by a deep sense of world crisis and personal responsibility. Stapledon believed that vision imposes social obligations upon the visionary and that the greatest mystics have been "not world-forsakers but world-embracers" (PL, p. 416). This sense of responsibility is exemplified by the "forwards" in Darkness and the Light. The Forwards are a class of individuals prone to vision and speculation, "tramps with a bent for self- observation" (9:153). They engage in rigid spiritual discipline and operate as professional visionaries. Their role (and Stapledon's as well) is twofold: they maintain "mankind's permanent outposts towards the superhuman" through their personal ecstasy, and they are assigned to communicate their more important findings to the rest of society (9:155). Similarly, the Last Man who enters the mind of the contemporary narrator of Last and First Men seeks to avert the tragedy of human extinction through positive social influence. In the prefaces to Last and First Men and Star Maker, Stapledon casts his own works in much the same light. He condemns the works of writers who avoid the pressing issues of their time as "subtly insincere" and characterizes his own fiction as providing "indirect" service to the "struggle of our age" by contextualizing current events (SM, 0:249-50). For both personal and moral reasons then, Stapledon- much like the narrator of Star Maker- was compelled to speak:</page><page sequence="4">252 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES. VOLUME 9 1982 Somehow I must tell something of that experience. Incvitable I face the task with a sense of abysmal incompetence. The greatest minds of the human race through all the ages of human history have failed to describe their moments of deepest insight. Then how dare I attempt this task'? And yet I must.

But speak he must. i13:406) Given his beliefs in the dangers of language. Stapledon was thus faced with a paradoxical bind. He was committed to the communication of vision and yet believed attempts at expression to be futile and misleading. In order that they might fulfill their formidable communicative obligations. Stapledon provided his fictional characters with means of expression denied himself. The Fifth Men and the Forwards employ a greatly expanded language with enough subtlety and symbolism to provide more faithful expression. Odd John, the Flames, the narrator of Star Mlaker. and the Fourth. Fifth. and Last Men all possess telepathy, enabling them to enter the minds of their auditors without relying upon language. Stapledon. on the other hand, is left to his own devices. While difficult enough to maintain as a personal philosophy, "agnostic mysticism" presents a far more severe challenge to the person who would share his experience with others through language. If words distort and demean vision and if powerful words about vision induce blindness and dangerous faith, the person compelled to speak must find forms and forums of expression capable of conveying or evoking both vision and skepticism. In order to sustain the attitude of agnostic mysticism and our interest in it, Stapledon believed he must create evocative symbols and myths from whose substance we would withhold belief. The rhetorical paradox posed by these competing demands influenced his choices of medium and of style. The Opening of the Eves portrays Stapledon's literary life as a series of experiments with forms and media. He found the philosophical treatise too confining in its reliance upon categorization, verification, "jungles of verbiage," and "significant nonsense" (p. 28). To escape this confinement, he turned to fiction. Long ago (it was while I was scrambling on a rugged coast, where great waves broke in blossom on the rocks) I had a sudden fantasy of man's whole future, aeon upon aeon of strange vicissitudes and gallant endeavours in world after world, seeking a glory never clearly conceived, often betrayed, but little by little revealed. The seeing was you, and the glory was you. Since then. vear after year, I have tried to create in words symbols of that vision. The labour was you; and you were the splendour which those crude symbols failed to manifest. (OE, p. 29) When expression is impossible, it may still be possible to communicate. Great literature, as Aldous Huxley observed, attempts to communicate "in words what words were never intended to convey," as the imprecisions of conventional language are supplemented with the richness of evoked expe- rience.3 Literature purifies the "language of the tribe" to the extent it makes accessible some aspect of an otherwise ineffable vision. The value of literature for Stapledon was based upon its ability to evoke the feeling of personal vision in others and at the same time to qualify its own</page><page sequence="5">STAPLEDON'S "AGNOSTIC MYSTICISM" 253 substantive veracity. In Philosophy and Living, he notes the obscure but powerful "feeling" that accompanies aesthetic experience (p. 423). In Old Man in New World, he attributes the revolutionary development of a societal search for the Light to the impetus of "this new attitude, this humble agnostic, yet deeply mystical, feeling, that broke the spell of disillusion and spread like a fire from heart to heart" (p. 21). Stapledon strove to spark the flames for his own world through the crafting of myth. In the preface to Last and First Men, he isolates the unique value of the futurist fantasy as its ability to depict man in his cosmic setting, "to mould our hearts to entertain new values" (0:9). In order to ensure that his fictions did not supply those values in forms that "fantastically belie" (OE, p. 83) his vision, Stapledon adapted his style to his philosophy. In her influential essay "On Style," Susan Sontag insists that "every work of art... needs to be understood not only as something rendered, but also as a certain handling of the ineffable."4 This is particularly true in evaluating the works of Stapledon. An early reviewer of Odd John remarked that "fiction is a tool he uses awkwardly."5 While this is certainly true at some points, it is also at least partially by design. 3. Stapledon deliberately averted belief in his myths through the employment of three stylistic techniques: indirection, immensity, and self-deprecation. Stapledon's use of indirection is evident in the vicarious nature of the visionary experiences his fictions describe. His major novels are presented as narratives produced by ordinary minds. Robert in Sirius, Thos in The Flames, Odd John's friend and biographer, and the Old Man in Old Man in New World are not visionaries themselves. Indeed, all are rather skeptical about the vision reported by their subjects. The terrestrial narrators of Last and First Men and Star Maker offer second-hand descriptions of events experienced and only partially communicated by beings of a radically different order from themselves. Virtually all characters and races presented in Stapledon's fiction are humans or aliens of an advanced and unimaginable level of consciousness. Last and First Men presents detailed insights into the culture, enterprises, and nature of the first four human species. The Fifth Men are the first to "reorganize [their] whole mentality" and society for the purpose of spiritual development. The bulk of their experience is thus beyond the vision of our narrator "[j just as the interests and ideals of the First Men lie beyond the grasp of their ape contemporaries" (11:170). The Last Men pose even greater obstacles for communciation and comprehension. We are told that "nearly everything that is most distinctive" of the Last Men-from the details of daily life on Neptune (14:205) to the ecstasy of the racial mind's contemplative trance- escapes us (16:237). The reader may share some identification with their spiritual search but can understand none of its substance. In Star Maker we are left behind from the start. Our petty comprehension is surpassed in even the initial evolutionary leap of consciousness. Yet Star Maker makes far greater use of the alien mind than Last and First Men and permits the narrator the ability to enter, experience, and incorporate the alien consciousnesses he encounters. He shares the sensations, fears, and sexual attractions of the Nautiloids. In the cosmic mind, he experiences the "slow drift of the galaxies much as a man feels the swing of his own limbs" (12:397). Beings or cultures that exceed his current stage of evolutionary development- particularly the Star Maker himself-are inaccessible to the narrator. What dim intuition the narrator bears of these experiences is not substantively translatable for our benefit. After the supreme moment of the cosmos has passed, the</page><page sequence="6">254 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 9 (1982) cosmic mind announces that "For the human author of this book there is now nothing left of that age-long. . . eternal moment... save the recollection of a bitter beatitude, together with a few incoherent memories of the experience itself which fired me with that beatitude" (13:406). Stapledon's indirection is most evident in his portrayal of the "group- mind." The group-mind provides access to the private experiences of individuals engaged in collective meditation. It is also capable of moving beyond the sum of its parts to realms of experience inaccessible to its individual members. Stapledon avoids description of the group-mind in its more advanced forms, advising in Last and First Men, "Of this obviously I can tell you nothing" (15:224). Yet the group-mind is the pinnacle of spiritual development in Stapledon's fiction. Operating as a super-being beyond language whom we imagine through language, the group-mind offers what Kenneth Burke has described as a transcendent self for "collective redemption."6 4. Stapledon complements his use of the evolutionary consciousness with an immensity of scale unparallelled in literature. Among his most ambitious works, Last and First Men provides an intellectual history of the human race (over two billion years) and Star Maker modestly undertakes a history of intelligence in the universe. In the latter, the entire saga of man is covered in two paragraphs. On Star Maker's famous time scales, human history diminishes from a small span in Scale One to a single line in Scale Two. It has no place at all in the third time scale. But, as the narrator of Last and First Men warns: "to grasp my theme in its true proportions, it is necessary to do more than calculate. It is necessary to brood upon these magnitudes, to draw out the mind toward them, to feel the littleness of your here and now, and of the moment of civilization which you call history" (0:14). When the Last Men unite in their racial mode to explore distant nebulae and remote universes, they are struck-even in this combined consciousness of the most developed human race-with the recognition of man's minuteness and finitude. The function of immensity for the Last and the First Men is twofold: to provide context and impetus for spiritual development, and to instill a sense of awe appropriate to the quest. This awe contributes no substantive information about the immensities that inspire it, yet it is powerful and essentially religious. As David Ketterer has argued, "the apparent infinity of the universe provides us with an analogy for eternity and some basis for confusing the heavens with Heaven."7 The contextualization of human affairs provided by Stapledon's expanded scale is the cornerstone of his moral argument. In A Modern Theory of Ethics, he insisted that a coherent ethical system must be based upon a broader perspective of human events; we must acquire a certain degree of distance in order to sense the larger purpose underlying our existence. The narrator of Last and First Men advises that "we must consider things from the astronomical rather than the human point of view" (14:205). Stapledon manifested this perspective in the Last Men, who possess an "upward-looking astronomical eye on the crown" of their heads more powerful than the First Men's telescopes (15:215). When in the racial mode, the Last Men devote themselves entirely to the development of the cosmic attitude, in which each individual seeks through celestial contemplation to "apprehend all things astronomically" (15:225). The view of human affairs from the far reaches of space and time affords a degree of objective detachment that is normally impossible. Stapledon's preface to Star Maker answers the self-imposed charge of fictional frivolity in a</page><page sequence="7">STAPLEDON'S "AGNOSTIC NMYSTICISM" 255 time of world crisis by affirming the value of viewing these events and conflicts with as little human prejudice as possible" i0:250). The immensity of Stapledon's vision produces awe and introspection. Without firm insight and expression. the reader is asked to act in accordance with the temper of inspiration and to avoid simple acceptance of doctrine. Immensity and evolutionarv consciousness are communicative strategies consistent with the spirit of agnostic mysticism. As style, they qualify more knowledge than they provide and evoke far more than they convey. They probe the limits of expression while employing these same limits to direct readerly attention and attitudes. 5. The most unusual and intriguing element of Stapledon's style is the penchant it displays for self-deprecation. He obviously did not wish his readers to ignore his feeble net of words." but neither did he seek to elicit belief in its substance. Ineffability is thus pursued in the novels as an explicit theme-a running metacommunicative commentary on the nature, limits, and proper appreciation of his works. Stapledon's narrators themselves express the doubts his readers are to bear regarding the veracity of the experiential descriptions. The narrator/friend of Odd John recognizes that he can comprehend little of John's experience and is, "as John confirmed, a very incompetent biographer" (OJ, 1:6). Stapledon's narrators dismiss the possibility of adequate translation and description of every visionary image, being, and important experience. Although the presence and nature of the Last Men are primary objects of concern in Last and First Men, the reader is constantly reminded of the difficulties involved in describing "this modern vision of the nature of things in any manner intelligible to those who have not our advantages" (15:228). As for the book itself, the grandest artifact of intervention by the Last Men, we are told that it "has issued from the brain of the writer, your contemporary, in such disorder as to be mostly rubbish" (16:241). The text of Star Maker is even more peppered with overt reservations regarding the veracity of its images. The narrator calls the tale a "ludicrously false caricature of our actual adventure" (5:300); and after providing a brief explanation of stellar mentality, he warns that this effort amounts to an attempted description of the "unintelligible by means of intelligible but falsifying human mataphors" (1 1:391). Conceptualization of the inhuman in human language is inevitably anthropomorphic. Following his attempted portrayal of the supreme moment of the cosmos, the most poetic and powerful passage in Star Maker, Stapledon offers an unusual literary postscript: "Barren, barren and trivial are these words" (13:407). Stapledon's war on his own words is designed to lessen readerly reliance upon the misleading images used in illustrating his perspectives. The constant and overt qualifications add agnostic doubt to mystical vision. reminding readers that his portraits of beings, worlds, and meanings are finally "no more reliable than the rigamarole of any mind unhinged by the impact of experience beyond its comprehension" (SM. 2:264). The awkwardness of his style is therefore perfectly appropriate to his philosophy of language and spiritual development. The reader is asked to "salute the vision" as "ithe dread niysterv no man can make clear" (OE, p. 9). Stapledon did not wholly dismiss the values of his myths and svmbols. He argued. in fact, that thev gain potency and utility as their limitations are recognized. Thus Robert. the human narrator of Sirius. offers the belief that with sufficient "imagination and self-criticism one can often penetrate into the</page><page sequence="8">256 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES. VOLUME 9 (1982) essential spirit of events even when the data are superficial" (1:169; emphasis added). Stapledon recognized the limits of vision and expression, yet sought to evoke in others and refine for himself the attitude he deemed appropriate for spiritual and social advancement. His moral insights are neither embalmed in dogma nor debased by propaganda; given his message, the presence of either would at best have been paradoxical. Those who seek to communicate something of what they believe cannot be expressed are forced to be silent, hypocritical, or creative. Fortunately, Stapledon chose the last course. His style is not only consistent with his personal commitment to agnostic mysticism, but also a successful means of communicating this attitude. For all his inventiveness-the marvelous beings and worlds, the evolved visions of ourselves and our experiences-grander still are his efforts to contextualize and discard these designs. Complex and indirect narrative structure, un- precedented immensities of scale, and unrelenting qualification-these he combines in a unique and powerful way. As a result, his fictions communicate more than they express, evoking an attitude and urgency of purpose without producing prolonged attachment to the substance of the verbal representations through which this is accomplished. Through its deliberately cultivated status as a "contemptibly crude and falsifying" myth (SM, 14:412), Stapledon's transfigured vision transcends the limits of language by raising his readers' awareness of them. Upon his return to Earth, the narrator of Stir Maker expresses Stapledon's abiding hope that "however false the vision in detail of structure, even perhaps in its whole form, in temper surely it was relevant; in temper perhaps it was even true" (16:430).

RESUME Robert Branham. Le Mysticisme agnostique de Stapledon. -La fiction de Staple- don se heurte au probleme de l'ineffable. Dans ses e'crits philosophiques, il pretend que la vision mystique ne peut etre rendue par des mots et que chercher a' le faire expose a de dangereuses falsifications. Mais en meme temps, il croit qu'une telle vision est un besoin pour le developpement personnel et social de l'homme. II resoud cette contradiction en adoptant la perspective paradoxale du "mysticisme agnostique" selon son expiession. II donne 'a ses romans visionnaires un style en rapport avec ces convictions. Siapledon cherche a communiquer une certaine intuition de sa vision a' travers une immensite d'echelle et des allusions calculktes, mais en evitant dtails explicites et interpretation. Virtuellement, toutes les images importantes des recits sont expressement mises en question par le narrateur. Mon objectif est d'examiner lesmotifs, les resultats et les implications du style e'tonnant de Stapledon. (RB)</page></plain_text>
