In the meantime, a major initial step in the construction of the NGJL has been the marketing of the Grid to an educational sector historically resistant and sceptical towards Information and Communications Technology. This paper therefore explores the emerging discourse of the NGJL by examining seven examples of marketing and promotional material produced by industry and the government. From these texts, we can therefore gain a sense of how the NGJL is beginning to be shaped at a macro level by its key actors. After presenting the seven texts, the paper explores the predominant themes underlying this discursive construction and highlights an underlying deterministic positioning of the Learning Grid. The paper concludes by considering the limitations of shaping the Learning Grid in this manner and argues for an alternative perspective in future research. Introduction The rapid permeation of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) into society has led to a renewed interest in the role of such technologies, in particular the Internet, in schools and colleges. Indeed, the Internet, and the metaphor of the 'information superhighway', has quickly become established as a tangible means of ushering education into the much heralded 'information age'. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the rhetoric of the current Labour government. Ensuring schools' connection to the Internet, it would seem, has become an essential prerequisite for maintaining education's relevance to the new post-industrial 'information age': Our goal is to have a computer-literate population of young people and a computer-literate workforce. We're opening up the opportunities of the infor- mation age to teachers and individual learners. In short, we're moving the education service into the twenty-first century and creating a 'connected society'.

Selwyn Technological change has revolutionised the way we work and is now set to transform education. Children cannot be effective in tomorrow's world if they are trained in yesterday's skills. Nor should teachers be denied the tools that other professionals take for granted. (Tony Blair, Department for Education and Employment (DfEE), 1997, p. 1) In practice, the government formally announced their intention to establish a 'National Grid for Learning' (NGfL) based on Internet access as part of their 1997 election manifesto. Consequently the 'Learning Grid' initiative was introduced in October of the same year, via the consultation document Connecting the Learning Society (DfEE, 1997), detailing plans to connect all of the UK's 30,000 schools to the Internet by the year 2002, establishing on-line educational resource centres as well as large-scale training pro- grammes for 450,000 teachers. The financing of this ambitious scheme was announced to be a blend of public and private money, with the actual construction and maintenance of the Learning Grid heavily reliant on commercial interests (Selwyn, 1998). As Connecting the Learning Society documented, the NGfL would be established via consortia of private companies, each of whom would bid to physically 'wire up' schools with the requisite hardware and to supply on-line educational software, effectively providing the content of the Grid. It was no surprise that telecommunications companies quickly pledged their involvement with such a major, and potentially lucrative, educational venture. In this way, large firms such as British Telecom, Research Machines, ICL, Xemplar and Microsoft soon positioned themselves alongside the government as major players in establishing the Learning Grid. Although the NGfL has been thrust upon the education sector in a blaze of publicity and hype, the 'physical' construction of the Grid promises to be a slow process, with the government giving an optimistic target of 3 years before the initiative will approach full operation. In the meantime, a major initial step in the construction of the NGfL has been the 'selling' of the Grid to an educational sector historically resistant and sceptical towards ICT. Thus, there has been a voluminous production of Learning Grid discourse via government policy documents and statements, as well as industry rhetoric designed at persuading educationalists, teachers, students and parents of the value of the initiative. This 'shaping' of the Grid is an essential element of the initiative as it will convince the 'consumers', upon whom the initiative is ultimately reliant, of its viability and value to education. Making the ethereal tangible is therefore the first crucial task facing both the government and the private interests responsible for constructing the NGfL. Examining the Marketing of the Learning Grid The marketing of the Learning Grid therefore provides a valuable insight into the nature of one of the largest education policy initiatives of the current Labour government. In particular, as Bromley (1997) argues, the way that technologies are described shape what we do and do not see in them, and how they are ultimately used and treated in society. It is therefore important to ask what such 'stories' omit (and therefore imply as insignificant) and question the assumptions presented to us as 'fact'. Bryson &amp; de Castell (1994) extend this line of argument when they contend that the burgeoning discourse of educational computing defines and delimits how technology is used in the classroom. In this way, we can begin to understand how technologies come to occupy the position they do in society (and therefore schools). Furthermore, as Sussman (1997) intimates, the</page><page sequence="3">Marketing of the National Grid for Learning 57 rhetoric used to sell the Learning Grid helps reveal the structures of power and real shaping concerns behind the ostensibly bland, corporate face of the initiative: Language, written and spoken (or signed), does not simply convey objective statements of fact or even expressions of intent. Language also transmits various semantic codes that have underlying narratives, stories and ways of seeing the world ... Clearly, language is used to establish or reinforce various representations of power, and those aspects of language are of interest to understanding politics ... Beyond the control of resources, capitalists must be able to create legitimacy for themselves in their role of resource developers, and this requires the capture of public discourse. When the captains of industry are not capable of responding to people's real needs, it becomes necessary for them to change the popular perception and language of 'need'. (Sussman, 1997, p. 30) In this way, as well as 'unpacking' the relationship between private interests and public concerns in terms of the Learning Grid itself, examination of the prevailing rhetoric and discourse of the Grid allows us to explore the wider synergy which exists between education, technology and society after 20 years of ICT in schools. This reflects the Foucauldian notion of discourse as the historical and cultural production of systems of knowledge and beliefs, which is shaped by, and shapes, our behaviour (Foucault, 1981), thus extending the individual text into the wider discursive field in terms of its effects rather than its internal organisation (Barker, 1998). Examination of discourse production in education thereby allows us to understand 'the multifaceted public process through which meanings are progressively and dynamically achieved' (Davies, 1989, p. 45). Nevertheless, although analysis of discourse has been used in other areas of education, especially gender issues (Davies, 1989; Walkerdine, 1990; Weiner, 1994) and media perceptions of educational issues (for example, Pettigrew &amp; Maclure, 1997), it has been less widely applied to educational technology. The remainder of this paper therefore explores the emerging discourse of the NGfL by presenting and then examining seven examples of marketing and promotional material produced by industry and the govern- ment. The seven texts were chosen as representative of their type and all, with one example, emanate from 'major players' in the NGfL; namely, Research Machines, British Telecom, ICL and the government themselves. From these texts, we can therefore gain a sense of how the NGfL is beginning to be shaped at a macro level by its key actors. After presenting the seven texts, this paper then concentrates on the predominant themes underlying this discursive construction and considers the limitations and likely effects of shaping the Learning Grid in this manner. Marketing the Learning Grid-seven texts Connecting the Learning Society (DfEE, 1997) One of the earliest marketing images of the Learning Grid appeared as the front cover of Connecting the Learning Society; the government's consultation document detailing the initiative. Here, four circular pictures cascade down the page, gradually increasing in size. The first portrays some Egyptian hieroglyphs, then a portion of medieval script followed by some metallic printing blocks. The final, largest image depicts a small, smiling girl pointing at a computer screen with banks of switches and other computer screens in the background. This modern depiction is ensconced by waves of binary data</page><page sequence="4">58 N. Selwyn (denoted by lines of zeroes and ones) which criss-cross to form a grid. As if the reader is in any doubt, the document explains on the proceeding page that: the cover graphics illustrate changes in communications technology over four millennia, from hieroglyphs, manuscript and movable type, to digital comput- ing. The largest picture shows the British Library's Turning Page prototype which enables rare manuscripts to be studied electronically, turning the page at a touch of a screen. (DfEE, 1997, p. ii) Beyond the high-quality 'feel' of the cover, one is immediately struck by the ambitious positioning of the grid in the context of 4000 years of communication, with the Learning Grid boldly presented as the learning technology of the next millennium. Segal (1994) has highlighted high technology's continual need to connect with the past, arguing that the producers of information technology look backward for some sort of reassurance and legitimacy, in what he terms a 'false nostalgia'. By aligning the Learning Grid with signs of Ancient Egyptian civilisation, the Department for Education would seem to be taking no chances in stating the case for the historical legitimacy of the initiative. Furthermore, illustrating the Grid with the British Library's Turning Page project reaffirms the message that the Learning Grid has the capacity to consume and reproduce all the knowledge that has gone before it, rendering all previous incarnations of information obsolete. Moreover, as the only human representation within these images indicates, all this informative power is easily within the grasp of our children. 'Plato on the Internet' (PLATO Computing 1998) This marketing communication shows two digitised planets closely orbiting each other in a scene evocative of countless science-fiction space films. The ethereal face of Plato looks knowingly on to the left of the picture as a bright light emerges from behind the smaller of the two planets. The accompanying text is no less bold when it reasons: Imagine the ability to provide education and training services anywhere, anytime to all of your learners whether they are in your local community or located throughout the world. The Internet offers the promise of universal access to information that can have a transforming impact on the nature of education and training, in classrooms offices and homes. Whereas the Connecting the Learning Society imagery was keen to stress the Learning Grid's historical origins, the Plato advertisement adopts the opposite approach, firmly alluding to the futuristic role of the Internet in education via its outer-space iconography. As Chesher (1997) points out, the use of extra-terrestrial imagery is a common metaphor in general marketing of Internet technology, with the popular mythologising of the Internet through images of cyberspace as a new space that transcends all old limits. 'This is the now standard fantasy in computer graphics about the new worlds opened up by computer technology: new spaces where all the old limits are transcended' (Chesher, 1997, p. 79). Such imagery also evokes the pioneering role of the Internet and the Learning Grid, with on-line learning pushing the limits of education beyond towns, countries and continents to global proportions. As Holmes (1997) reasons, the cultural popularising of the Internet as an 'information superhighway' is itself driven by the iconography of pioneering, thus enabling a fulfilment of a modernist drive towards mastery of the world. In this way, PLATO are offering little short of a 'universal' transformation of edu- cation-'anywhere, anytime'. All this contrasts sharply with the spectre of the company's</page><page sequence="5">Marketing of the National Grid for Learning 59 namesake looming at the side of the picture. The use of Plato, one of the founding fathers of the pedagogic tradition, as a symbol of educational progression and authenticity appears plausible enough but, again, is not a new trend in marketing technology. Information technology has continually used historical figures to promote its products. From Apple Computer's use of Isaac Newton to IBM's portrayal of Charlie Chaplin's 'Little Tramp', such marketing 'both misappropriates and trivialises the past and bespeaks an anxiety about the present and the future' (Segal, 1994, p. 188). In a similar vein, Plato is crudely used in an attempt to lend historical gravitas to an otherwise futuristic techno-utopian vision. "Its Just a Tool ...' (Research Machines 1998) Whereas the DfEE and PLATO texts focus predominantly on the technology of the Learning Grid, this Research Machines advertisement takes an opposite, humanistic approach. A highly stylised, almost soft-focused, black and white photograph of a small, half-naked boy brushing his teeth is contrasted against the text, which is presented in the house-style of Windows 95 dialogue boxes. Thus the headline 'The National Grid for Learning-It's just a tool' is emblazoned across the photograph as a Windows drop- down menu, accompanied by the following message: The National Grid for Learning-It's just a tool ... But a very important one. One that will be essential to your pupils' learning development. To make sure you have all the right information talk to RM. Because we are the IT partners to more schools than any other company in the UK ... National Grid for Learning? Join here. This narrative is in stark contrast to the rhetoric of both the Connecting the Learning Society and 'Plato on the Internet' images. Whereas PLATO were keen to stress the universal transformation that the Internet will provide for education, Research Machines are actively attempting to portray the Learning Grid as just another tool to use with students. Furthermore, the imagery symbolising using the Learning Grid as a tool is so transparent that it can almost be treated as part of an unconscious daily routine akin to brushing your teeth. Such contradictory rhetoric has been a common feature of educational computing over the past 20 years. As Hodas (1996) observes: Change advocates, of whom technologists are a permanent subset, often try to have things both ways ... The introduction of computers, for example, is hailed in one discourse as a process that will radically change the nature of what goes on in the classroom ... In another discourse computers are sold as straightfor- ward tools to assist in carrying out pre-existing tasks and fulfil pre-existing roles, not as Trojan horses whose acceptance will ultimately require the acquisition of an entirely new set of skills and world outlook. (p. 208) Thus, the contrasting rhetoric of the three texts discussed so far may be largely explained by their respective intended audiences. Whereas the Connecting the Learning Society and 'Plato on the Internet' seem to be aimed towards managers of education., the Research Machines advertisement firmly targets practitioners of education--a group traditionally seen as being stubbornly resistant to technological innovation in the classroom (Cuban, 1986). Hence the soothing nature of the Research Machines text; 'it's just a tool', albeit one you should be aware of for your students' sake if nothing else.</page><page sequence="6">60 N. Selwyn "Brings New Children Into Class' (British Telecom 1998) and "The Internet: Explained by Sarah aged 7' (Research Machines 1998) Continuing with the human interest theme, the British Telecom advertisement shows a very young Thai boy, sitting at a desk surrounded by other students, clutching a pen and paper and looking at the (out of view) teacher. This instantly familiar classroom scene is juxtaposed by the fact that the small boy, and all his classmates, are sporting shaven heads and are dressed in the orange robes of novice monks. The text reads: Telecommunications brings new pupils into class: the life of a novice monk is very different from that of your pupils. But with technology they can communi- cate with him as if he was in the same room. That's one of the most obvious benefits of communications. We [provide] a number of products that will bring you the world. Similarly, the Research Machine advertisement uses another familiar image from the classroom, that of a child's drawing. Here the drawing, entitled 'The Internet-explained by Sarah aged seven', shows a crude globe with three figures standing on disparate islands. At the top of the globe is a child singing outside school with a computer ('me and my computer at school'). To the right is a male figure proclaiming 'bonjour' ('Henri helps me learn about France') with an upside down female teacher at the opposite side of the world ('I learn about animals from Mrs Hawkes in Australia'). Underneath this literal portrayal of global communication runs the text: The Internet-explained by Sarah aged seven. As the foundation of the National Grid for Learning the Internet plays a big part in the future of teaching and learning. By encouraging communication between pupils, teach- ers and other Internet users around the globe it makes subjects more interesting and exciting. The potential learning gains are enormous. Both these texts choose to focus specifically on one aspect of the Learning Grid; the benefits of on-line communication. As a communications technology, the Internet is popularly seen as a means of 'bringing close what is far away' (Holmes, 1997, p. 28) and so the emphasis in both texts on the 'transportation' capability of Internet technologies concentrates on the benefits of on-line communication with highly distanced subjects. The exoticism of communicating with Thai monks (however unlikely in practice) and Australian teachers again stresses the limitless global boundaries of the Learning Grid. Such an emphasis merely replicates general marketing of Internet technologies over the last decade. Wise (1997) describes how the information networks have been commonly constructed through corporate imagery of globalisation and internationalisation. In this way, the Internet is often represented by circumnavigation of the world to exotic locations creating pervasive metaphors for the exploratory mode of hypermedia tech- nologies. Both texts described here adopt this strategy, intimating that via the Learning Grid, teachers and students can be party to a 'virtual shrinking' of the globe, with all the 'obvious benefits' this entails. "The Natural Choice' (ICL 1998) and 'We're Making the Grid Simple' (Research Machines 1998) This final pair of advertisements adopt a fourth approach to marketing the Grid, carrying the dual messages that the Learning Grid is a very important part of education but, nevertheless, is a confusing and complicated process for teachers to understand. ICL, one of the major industrial players in the Learning Grid, use a picture of two schools of</page><page sequence="7">Marketing of the National Grid for Learning 61 fish swimming in opposite directions through a coral reef, coupled with the slogan 'The Natural Choice'. As the finer print expands: When it comes to joining the Internet, working together has its advantages. Many schools are keen to embrace the learning opportunities offered by the Internet and the National Grid; for Learning. Existing methods of connection can be complicated and costly and the service offered may not be good enough to fully exploit the National Grid for Learning. Now ICL Education Systems have created an exciting new concept in Internet access called the Local Grid for Learning (LGfL) ... The result? A LGfL makes the access to the National Grid for Learning much more cost effective and allows schools to really concentrate on exploring the way in which the Grid can work for them. The final Research Machines advertisement relays a similar message, albeit using no pictures, by proclaiming in bold, upper-case type: WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU IMPROVE YOUR PUPILS' LEARNING GAINS BY MAKING THE NATIONAL GRID FOR LEARNING EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND SIMPLE TO USE. However, all but five of the words have been hurriedly crossed out to leave the slogan reading 'WE'RE ... MAKING THE ... GRID ... SIMPLE'. Underneath this, smaller print reads: The National Grid for Learning is one of the most exciting and ambitious developments in education this country has ever seen. It will revolutionise how pupils are taught and improve learning gains. To take full advantage you need to understand it. At RM we can help you do this. Using the experience and knowledge gained while supplying educational IT for 20 years we can simplify the complexities of the Grid and show you exactly what you need to get the most out of it. If you want to find out more about the National Grid for Learning [contact us]. We promise a simple answer to your questions. As well as playing on one of the predominant societal reactions to technology (an ignorance and fear of the innovative), these adverts are distinct in that they also lend a degree of visibility to their actors (ICL and Research Machines). Nevertheless, both companies are represented as very altruistic guides through the confusion of the Grid and suggestion of any other underlying motives is kept well hidden. Thus, both companies are merely 'natural' and 'simple' good Samaritans, with little allusion to their actual role beyond helping schools negotiate the demands of the initiative. Although both texts allude to the telecommunications companies' role in constructing the Learning Grid, they go no further in expanding on their motives or intentions, obscuring this role behind the promises of the initiative. As Dietrich (1997) argues, commercial companies are often unwilling to divulge the extent of their involvement in public telecommunications schemes beyond establishing their names as synonymous with the technology: Oftentimes, the rhetoric of the new communications technologies only serves to mystify and obscure the relations of production and labour which structure its very material enterprise. The euphoric praise nearly always associated with virtual systems can act as a kind of smokescreen, in which an emphasis on the end obscures any clear understanding of the means used to get there. (Dietrich, 1997, p. 174)</page><page sequence="8">62 N Selwyn A Conflicting Yet Utopic Rhetoric From this brief selection of texts, it would appear that both government and industry are relying on a variety of strategies to market the Learning Grid to the educational sector. Ostensibly, this would appear to have created an often contradictory rhetoric surrounding the initiative and its potential to schools. The Grid is portrayed both as a complete reassessment of educational practice but, on the other hand, a mere tool for teachers and students to use like any other. This tool is easy to use but also unfathomable without expert advice. It is mundane and everyday, yet exotic and exciting; steeped in the confines of history and futuristically limitless. Throughout all the texts, it would seem that the Learning Grid is being presented as somewhat of an educational chameleon. Information Technology has continually been sold to schools behind an amalgam of conflicting stories (Bromley, 1997) and, to an extent, the ambiguity demonstrated in marketing the Grid reflects the wider paradoxical nature of the Internet. As McKie (1996) postulates, the Internet theoretically represents both unification and fragmentation, leading to an inevitable contemporary ambivalence towards the technology. The inherent clash that the Internet has with conventional modernist notions such as the linear progression of time and space, or the concept of a single, unitary self, inevitably leads to contradiction. Indeed, to adopt Baudrillard's (1988) term, marketing the 'hyperreal' will inevitably be a multi-dimensional practice. However, despite its post-modern nature, the Internet is still being marketed to education within conspicuously modernist narratives. Indeed, the use of the 'Grid' metaphor is itself a restrictive modernist discourse in which to position educational use of the Internet. As Chesher (1997, p. 86) contends, 'Grids are a modernist model of space. The ontology of the digital domain is an embodiment in electronics of the ideal of addressibility that the modernist project imposed on the physical world'. Despite these obvious contradictions, the shaping of the Learning Grid throughout all the texts is unashamedly positive in outlook, adhering to Bryson &amp; de Castell's (1994) paradigm of a 'modernist/romantic' account of educational technology. This is hardly surprising, for as Wise (1997, p. 167) contends, 'it is in the communications industry's best interests to present the current technological assemblage as one that will increase our individual power and will bring happiness to all'. Thus, all the texts presented in this paper project highly idealised visions of technologically enriched education. As Kenway (1995, p. 49) observes, 'evident here is a repetition of the history of hype which occurred when microcomputers first came on the market-basically a hard sell through soft images'. It is tempting to dismiss these texts as nothing more than modern-day examples of Roszak's (1994) 'Data Merchants', with an incessant selling of the 'information economy' in which they have an intrinsic interest. From this perspective, one would expect a profusion of blue-skies optimism or 'silicon idolatry' (Shallis, 1984) to have pervaded the marketing of the Learning Grid. Yet behind this apparent technological utopianism, it is possible to trace a more revealing picture of the Learning Grid and, it follows, the foundations of the 'information society' premise of education. By pursuing such an analysis, we can begin to 'unpack' the inherent biases in the construction of the Grid and formulate an alternative agenda for future examination and analysis of its implementation. The Determinist Discourse of the Learning Grid A Technological Determinist View Beyond a shared, but contradictory, techno-romanticism, all the seven texts presented in this paper ultimately conform to one of the two dominant paradigms that have</page><page sequence="9">Marketing of the National Grid for Learning 63 traditionally beset educational computing; either technological or social determinism. On the one hand, many of the texts present the Learning Grid as an inevitable consequence of technological development and change, adhering to an overtly 'technological deter- minist' view of the initiative. As Woolgar (1996, p. 88) details, technological determinism is 'the belief that new technology emerges as an extrapolation of previous technologies, with the characteristics of a technology hav[ing] a direct impact on social arrangements'. This substantive view sees technology as guiding and shaping society with its own logic, autonomous to social forces (Edge, 1995). Thus technology is seen as the driving force of society; as technology changes, so society follows. Although, as Grint &amp; Woolgar (1997) point out, it is difficult to find anyone actively aligning themselves with technologi- cal determinism, such discourse has been central in post-war thinking about technology from Herbert Marcuse to Marshall McLuhan. Technological determinism has also been particularly prominent in post-industrial discourse, from the writing of Daniel Bell to the more popularist work of Alvin Toffler and John Naisbitt. Given such pervasiveness, it is no surprise that the notion of a 'technological imperative' has been prevalent in the construction of the Learning Grid, shackled as the initiative is in a post-industrial/ information society rationale. Brief reconsideration of the seven texts reveals the extent of the technological determinism inherent in the Learning Grid discourse. For example, the Grid is unprob- lematically presented as having a transformatory effect on education. In this way, the Grid 'will revolutionise how pupils are taught and improve learning gains' (Research Machines 'Making the Grid Simple'). The Internet will 'have a transforming impact on the nature of education and training' (PLATO Computers). In the same vein, the symbols used in the Connecting the Learning Society cover are the epitome of the notion of the Learning Grid as the inevitable and logical extrapolation of four millennia of technological development. The repeated theme behind all of these texts could not be clearer; the Learning Grid is a natural yet transformatory stage in the progression of education. Such rhetoric fits neatly into the traditional technological determinist view of change as inevitable, with necessary and determinate 'impacts' upon society, thus making it an effective vehicle for achieving organisational 'progress' (Williams &amp; Edge, 1996). This deterministic discourse is also apparent in the texts' anthropomorphism of telecommunications technology. Here, the Learning Grid, which is after all an inanimate instrument, is given animate capabilities and therefore assigned an agency beyond its means. Thus, to give one example, the NGfL and telecommunications in general 'brings new pupils into class' (British Telecom 'Bringing New Pupils into Class'). But does the Learning Grid, as an inanimate technology, really have the capability of 'bringing' pupils into class or is this a means of evading the real actors-in this case, the telecommunica- tions industry? Expanding Sussman's (1997) line of argument, the anthropomorphism of assigning agency to the Learning Grid primarily serves to obscure the vested interests that underlie the successful (and profitable) implementation of the technology, thus diverting attention away from the true nature and purpose of the initiative. As Sussman (1997, p. 25) expands: Technological determinist language employs a confident anthropomorphising of inanimate instruments, assigning to computers, robots and machine technol- ogy in general the animate attributes of consciousness, will, creativity and spontaneity ... This way of ascribing power to the machine gives the im- pression that technological developments unfold as inevitable progressions, driven by their own momentum, as if economic conquest and expansion and</page><page sequence="10">64 N. Selwyn the ruthless appropriations of property and wealth are irrelevant consider- ations. The political value of such language allows the technocracy within business and government to present itself as proceeding without passion or favouritism; and, above all, with the neutrality toward partisan interests that leaves it free to select and implement the best technological solution. This anthropomorphising of the Learning Grid asserts that educational outcomes derive primarily from the material characteristics of ICT itself, regardless of the intentions of teachers and schools. In this way the Learning Grid is seen as the driving force-not teachers, not students and certainly not industry interests. Obscuring external (non- technological) interests in this way is 'a disempowering stance' for education to adopt, 'impl[ying] anything we do in an effort to control the path of technological development and its impact on society will be futile' (Bromley, 1997, p. 54). Furthermore, this disassociation of the Learning Grid from its social context may well curtail the eventual effectiveness of the initiative when implemented in schools. As Bigum (1997, p. 250) continues: By locating their understanding of [ICTs] in the logic of one or other forms of technological determinism, schools severely limit their capacity to come to terms with the role in which new technologies are playing in the restructuring of schools and school systems and they have even less capacity to make connections to large-scale change in society in which the new information technologies are implicated. A Social Determinist View On the other hand, a similarly pervasive discourse throughout the seven texts is the Learning Grid as 'just a tool', a more or less neutral means to an educational end. This opposite view of the determinist relationship between society and technology asserts that it is society that shapes and influences technology. Thus, 'social determinism' posits that technology is a neutral instrument that can be moulded and used for various purposes. From this 'instrumentalist' approach, technologies just appear to order in response to society's demands and the interests of the market (Williams &amp; Edge, 1996); what society wants society will get. As Wise (1997) asserts, from such a social deterministic view, technology is contingent on interpretation and interpretative frameworks. The properties of objects are not inherent in the objects themselves but conferred on objects by social consensus and definition. Thus, society shapes technology, as opposed to the technologi- cal deterministic view of technology shaping society. Such rhetoric is strongly reflected in some of the Learning Grid marketing, most notably the overt presentation of the Learning Grid as 'just a tool' (Research Machines 'Just a Tool'), albeit one which may be complicated to use and understand (Research Machines 'Making the Grid Simple', ICL 'The Natural Choice'). Furthermore, the Grid is also portrayed as appearing in response to the needs and demands of education. Texts such as the PLATO and ICL advertisements firmly position the Internet and Learning Grid as market responses to real educational demands. Education can now have what it is 'keen to embrace' (ICL 'Natural Choice'). Yet one can argue that this social determinist view of the Learning Grid is equally as constricting as the previous technological determinist discourse. As Bromley (1997, p. 54) asserts, to view educational computing in purely instrumentalist terms is to over-estimate the flexibility and neutrality of technology:</page><page sequence="11">Marketing of the National Grid for Learning 65 recognising the significance of the context of use, the responsiveness of technologies to social dynamics, is a useful insight, but technologies are not infinitely malleable; they cannot be put to absolutely any end at will, and certainly not with equal ease. Similarly, as Winner (1980) argues, although social determinism acts as an antidote to 'naive' technological determinism, it is itself flawed in assuming that technologies themselves are of no importance. In short, social determinism fails to recognise that technological artefacts are imbued with politics in their own right. Thus, purely to view the Learning Grid as a neutral tool arising from societal demand is again to mis-read the social and cultural significance of the technology itself. Towards a New Discourse of the Learning Grid As we have seen, the predominant shaping of the Learning Grid through industry and government rhetoric has taken a restricted determinist 'reading' of the initiative. In fact, most of the texts combine elements of both social and technological determinism in their portrayal of the Learning Grid, which Wise (1997, p. 11) argues is an inevitable situation as 'both of the dominant views (technological or social determinism) are abstractions, and we find few who actually adhere strictly to one or the other; rather most theories combine elements of both'. In doing so, however, this 'official' construction of the Learning Grid is severely curtailed by its positioning within such a limited 'cause and effect', modernist perspective. Such views of the Learning Grid obscure crucial elements of the initiative. In particular, the framing of the Grid within a determinist discourse hides the actors who stand most from its construction. As Lyon (1988, p. 18) argues, this is a common shortcoming of the 'information society', with popular rhetoric designed so that it 'obscures vested interests that are involved in IT and that in fact do so much to shape its overall direction ... yield[ing] no clues as to who wields power'. Furthermore, this discourse ignores (intentionally or otherwise) the agency of the schools, teachers and students on whom, in reality, the Grid is dependent. In short, the prevailing shaping and framing of the Learning Grid within a technocratic discourse ignores the social origins and context of the initiative. As Lemke (1995, p. 58) asserts, 'the political advantage of this technocratic strategy to those who practice it is that it presents policy as if it were directly dictated by matters of fact and deflects consideration of values choices and the social, moral and political responsibility for such choices'. This should be seen as an extremely short-sighted and potentially crippling stance to adopt. The Learning Grid is not some autonomous and external influence on schools, neither it is a neutral tool shaped and influenced by the needs of schools and society in general. Following Lyon's argument, adopting any of these positions either understates the role of social institutions in the development of use of the Learning Grid or understates the limits on how easily the Learning Grid can be used to a given agenda. These prevailing views only serve to obscure the inherent social and cultural nature of the initiative at all macro, meso and micro levels of construction and implementation. Echoing Qvortrup's (1984, p. 7) argument that computing 'cannot be properly under- stood if we persist in treating technology and society as two independent entities', educationalists should strive to move beyond the view that the Learning Grid as a technology is distinct from society in either its cause or effect. Instead, as Bromley (1997,</page><page sequence="12">66 N. Selwyn p. 63) argues, there should be a move away from positions of either 'technophillia' or 'techno-neutralism' towards: a perspective that avoids drawing a technology/society distinction, and focuses on the social contexts where technologies are developed, and the ones where they are used. [This therefore] recognises that technologies are developed out of institutional needs and their impact is always mediated through the institutional arrangements and the social forces of which they are an integral part. In this way, recognising the complex unity of society and educational technology and resisting the sanitised and deterministic rhetoric of the Learning Grid, will allow for a far more revealing, and ultimately effective, analysis of the initiative and avoid replication of the previous myopia which has so blighted and restricted educational computing in the past. Thus, an alternative 'technostructuralist' framework of analysis (Tehranain, 1990) should be adopted when critically examining the Learning Grid, from its 'construction' at the macro level of government and industry to its implementation at the micro level of the school. At a national and international level, key questions remain regarding the educational benefits of the Learning Grid juxtaposed against the wider economic and social functions of the initiative and the emerging Information Superhighway. In particular, it is important to consider how the role of the Learning Grid will be affected by the increasing influence of market forces into education (Kenway et al., 1994; Kenway, 1996). More importantly, what does the relentless global economic construction of the Infor- mation Superhighway (Schiller, 1995) have to offer education and where will this eventually leave the effectiveness of the 'Learning Grid' for UK schools and colleges? At a more localised, institutional level, additional questions are raised concerning the impact of the NGfL. A central tenet of the Learning Grid initiative is that substantial government and business subsidies will allow schools to effectively get connected to the Information Superhighway free of charge; but how 'free' can the Learning Grid be, especially in terms of the inherent economic and political interests that fundamentally drive the construction and implementation of the initiative? To what extent will the Learning Grid afford schools and colleges unrivalled access to communication and information sources across the globe? How much do the extensive claims that are currently being made about the role of the Internet in UK education obscure the actual nature and usefulness of the information that teachers and students will be able to access in practice? Furthermore, can the Learning Grid possibly provide the 'equality of access for learners' (DfEE, 1997, p. 14) that the government claim? In short, the underlying focus of researching the National Grid for Learning should be to position the initiative and its effects within the, as yet unvoiced, social and political context to which it is inexorably linked. Only by adopting this approach, and moving outside of the restrictive and determinist narrative that is being constructed, can we really tell if the Learning Grid can be anything more than a reflection of the traditional societal trust in the 'technological fix' (Weinburg, 1966) that has so beset education in the past.
