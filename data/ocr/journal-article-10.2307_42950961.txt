Beginning with Job's conundrum, 'where shall wisdom be found?', C. proposes that different groups in the ancient world answered the question in different ways. Some saw wisdom as an anthropomorphic divinity, others as the highest fruit of the human intellect. For some, wisdom led to a good life; for others, to God or the contemplation of eternal truths. For some, wisdom resided chiefly in people; for others, in gods, texts, or various kinds of expertise. C. observes that wisdom is, and is recognized in the ancient world as being, highly mobile, crossing political, cultural, historical and</page><page sequence="2">112 Reviews geographical boundaries with ease, which makes it an apt subject for a study encompassing Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece and Rome. What all these cultures shared was a highly-developed interest in representing and discussing wisdom, which they expressed in a rich diversity of surviving sources. C. offers four hypotheses through which he explores his material. First, 'wisdom in the ancient world was a mul ti- faceted affair'. Alongside wisdom literature, perhaps its most studied form, wisdom may be located in gods or cults, in myths and legends, in historical figures - political, religious or intellectual - in shamans, seers and saints, and in certain skilled activities, from divination to science to architecture. C.'s six main chapters follow these categories, most being divided into cross-cultural subsections (all the shamans, for instance, appearing together, and all the judges). To distinguish several locations of wisdom and put their manifestations in different cultures side by side is an attractive approach, and one favoured by many students of wisdom literature in the past. The challenge for any such study is to make comparisons without losing sight of the complexity of individual cultures. C.'s presentation tends to gloss over the complexity of his contributing cultures, which is a pity, because over-simplification always risks distorting the cross-cultural comparison, and also leaves those who know something about the individual cultures feeling short-changed. C.'s second hypothesis is that the 'pre-eminent value in the ancient world was order', and that wisdom was associated above all with the creation, maintenance or observation of order in the world, by gods or human beings. It is a bold move to unite such varied material under one key idea. I have a lot of sympathy with the idea that order is a recurrent theme in ancient ethical thinking, but I should have liked to read a developed argument for its importance in general and its pre-eminence in particular. C.'s third hypothesis is that 'beliefs about divine wisdom ... reflect beliefs about human wisdom, but extrapolated to a higher level, up to and including that of perfection'. The final hypothesis is that wisdom was manifested primarily in certain people, secondarily in certain practices, and only lastly in a certain kind of literature'. This is a thought-provoking suggestion, and it would have been interesting to see it applied in detail to the material. In the event, it is a weakness of this and the other hypotheses that rather than being discussed extensively in relation to the sources, they are rather taken for granted after their first statement, and the sources presented without much further reference to them. When aiming to cover as much ground as C. does, an author can introduce audiences to the material without saying a great deal about it, or assume that audiences know the material and focus on the argument. C.'s chapter divisions do much of the work of the second option. Within each chapter, he sketches what is known or hypothesized about the person, practice or work he is introducing, and says one or two things about its style</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 113 or content. The ways in which wisdom models and materials travel (or do not travel), and interact through time and space in the ancient Near East and Mediterranean, are a fascinating study, sure to capture the imaginations of readers who are not familiar with them, and C.'s pointers towards these movements and interactions whet the appetite for further study. Scholars in any of the fields he touches on may find food for thought in C.'s hypotheses, but most of the book is for general readers, who will find it very engaging and accessible. Quotations from the sources are translated; the text is decorated with an attractive range of illustrations, and it includes a timeline and eight useful maps.
