<plain_text><page sequence="1">Allegories of Progress: Industrial Religion in the United States Richard J. Callahan, Jr.,* Kathryn Lofton, and Chad E. Seales This essay argues that the emergence of new factory systems and market cultures in the United States included the promotion of "indus- trial religion." Industrial religion is a discourse that attributes suprahu- man power to raw materials and the mechanical technologies employed to convert those materials into consumer goods. Through descriptions of coal production in the Appalachian Mountains, factory supervision in the South, and soap promotions in the Northeast, we survey three foci of industrial religion: material power, technologies of conversion, and cultures of consumption. We argue that American Protestant refor- mers and industrialists collaborated to use industrial religion in order to civilize landscapes, cleanse bodies, and convert individuals into the requisite disciplines of modern labor and consumption. The pamphlets, speeches, and prescriptions of industrial religion narrated aUegories of spiritual progress even as they defined the metrics of material success. ^Richard J.

Smith published The Philosophic Way of Life, in which he criticized religion for using "argument rather than industry" to "manipulate one's self without correcting one's environment." For Smith, religion per- suades, whereas industry produces. Declaring "if works won't, then faith will," Smith argued that religion "encourages a renunciation of creative effort and a resignation to the order that already prevails" (1929: 62-63). l Rejecting religion as incapable of changing present con- ditions, Smith reified a dichotomous description of religion and indus- try, naming industry as capable of a productivity that religion inhibits. Such a view celebrates industry as the only available technology by which humanity might be pressed into a rational, prosperous future. In predictable contrast, religion traps people in a deluded, ephemeral nos- talgia. Industry was an allegory for modern civilization: it demanded the excision of religion in the name of progress. In the eighty years since Smith's evisceration of religion, his cat- egories have undergone serious revision, as scholars began to tackle the creative, controlling, and ambiguous relationship between God and mammon (McDannell 1995; Curtis 1991; Joselit 1994; Moore 1994; Schmidt 1995). The chronological trajectory of these studies suggests that the rise of consumer capitalism was integral to the invention of modern religion, that industry and religion were neither inseparable, nor competing, nor contingent upon the other's collapse. Nonetheless descriptions of modern religious life have often been premised on an assumption that religion and industry were disjoined categories within modern society.2 Indeed, the distinction between religion and industry was a defining characteristic of early-twentieth century analyses of reli- gion. The question for those observers was whether industry's discursive other, religion, would survive modernity.3 Now, after a century of ^or a survey of Smith in relation to his contemporaries, see Johnson (1932). This categorical rupture is most visibly displayed in secularization theory, in both past and present forms. Theories of secularization that predicted the privatization of religious practice and the decline of public religion in modern societies have been revised significantly. However, many of those revisions keep the same structural frame of earlier secularization theories. These revisions still assume that secularization actually happens, in its own evolutionary history. But rather than culminating in the absence of religion, these revisions describe a next stage of religious resurgence in the public sphere. These stages of removal to revival are most clearly illustrated in the secularization to desecularization schema. These models thus retain a problematic conception of "religion" and "the secular" as separate and identifiable spheres rather than as mutually constituting transformations of sociocultural and, indeed, political, processes. For example, see Berger et al. (1999). Ernst Troeltsch stated this quandary forcefully in the Social Teachings of the Christian Churches, published the same year as Durkheim's Elementary Forms. Sounding the tone for Protestant liberal theology, Troeltsch pondered how Christianity could address the "secular conditions of life" when</page><page sequence="3">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 3 comparative religions and commercial climaxes, we can answer affirma- tively, if warily, to that inquiry: religion and industry have been code- pendent as institutional bodies, as social organizers, and as moral vantages for national life (Giggie and Winston 2002). Industry did not just provide funding sources for religion, and religion did not just supply affirmations for industry. Together, their institutional structures codified and conveyed a set of practices to engage the new world orders they sought to propagate. This relationship encompasses what we classify as industrial religion: a discourse that attributes suprahuman power to raw materials and the mechanical technologies employed to convert those materials into con- sumer goods. The coining of "industrial religion" is an intentionally antiquarian invocation, drawing upon the categorizations of an era which produced, simultaneously, the processes of industrialization and their classification by the social scientists who examined the besetting beast of modernity.4 i it did not contain a distinct social ethic ([1912] 1992: 149). For Troeltsch, Christian theologians had borrowed their ethical frameworks from secular sources, whether it was Augustine with Plato or Aquinas with Aristotle. If Christianity were to survive modernity and have an impact on social life, then it would need to acknowledge the influence of those sources and engage them as moral transactions. Troeltsch concluded that for Protestantism to mold "modern economic forms of industry" in the shape of "Christian social order," it would need to recognize, as he felt Calvin had done, that "spiritual values are conditioned by the material, external setting in which they are placed" ([1912] 1992: 88). In contrast to Thomas Smith's "philosophic way of life," Troeltsch prescribed a cheerfully religious and reflexively Protestant narrative. Yet, like Smith, Troeltsch considered religion in itself incapable of altering the modern environment. In this way, liberal theology shared with positivist critiques of religion an assumption that religion and industry were bifurcated. Each was a type of power that differed in form, as spiritual to material. For a representative example of that tone of Protestant liberal theology, see Harry Liebersohn's monograph on the Protestant Social Congress in Wilhelmine Germany (1986). For a survey of liberal Protestant responses to industrialization in the United States from 1828 to 1895, see May ([1949] 1963). In the second half of the nineteenth century, Auguste Comte promoted his "religion of humanity" as an alternative to Christianity best suited to grapple with the challenges of industrial society (Wernick 2001). The normative impulse of Comte's positivism, of a religion without God and a devotion to human ability, permeated later sociological interpretations of religion. That stimulus was essential to the writings of Marx, whose infamous "opiate" designation derived from a very empirical anxiety about the prevailing modes of industrial production and their resultant social ills (Marx and Engels [1841-1895] 2000). Weber too fretted about the religious distractions (and collaborative acquiescence) to industrial order, writing that the believer, like the laborer, was prisoner of an "iron cage" ([1905] 1958). And in the later nineteenth century, Durkheim plotted the removal of religion from social life through industrialization ([1893] 1949). Like Comte and Marx, he initially favored that removal. But by 1912, when he published The Elementary Forms of Religious Life, he had revised his earlier position. Emphasizing the institutional power of religion, Durkheim described the ritual development of a "civil religion" within differentiated industrial societies ([1912] 1995). Durkheim found religion's reasons, but still needed industry to make those reasons reasonable. Studies that address the relationship between religion and industry in the United States have been dominated by the sociological models established by this critical troika</page><page sequence="4">4 Journal of the American Academy of Religion In the three cases that we summarize (coal production in the Appalachian Mountains, factory supervision in the South, and soap promotions in the Northeast), we show how reformers and industrialists collaboratively promoted industrial religion in an effort to regulate bodies- geological, demographic, and biological- and fit them into the requisite disciplines of modern labor and consumption. In this essay, we do not directly address the practice of those rituals by consumer communities.5 Our goal is to highlight the discursive relationship between religion and industry in the promotion of industrial religion, while setting out a research agenda for the possible examination of its practice.6 This is to emphasize the industrial allegory rather than reli- gious activism, to notice shared rhetoric and ritual across organizational bodies that sometimes imagined themselves at odds. In our story, industrialists act as missionaries and missionaries employ industrial strategies. This complements the existing literature which explores how amenable American Protestants were to market appeal and the pursuit of personal prosperity (Noll 200 1).7 (Marx, Weber, and Durkheim). H. Richard Niebuhr employed Marx's emphasis on material formation in his Social Sources of Denominationalism ([1929] 1987). Peter Berger extended Weber's thesis of disenchantment in The Sacred Canopy (1967). And Robert Bellah elaborated on Durkheim's evolutionary schema of public ritual in "Civil Religion in America" (1967). The rhetoric and ritual involved in the translation of an object to a commodity in the United States may include the attribution of enchanting powers to raw materials, the elaboration of a priestly caste who could translate between the high (industry, church institution, mercantile) and low (purchaser, bather, worker), and the development of personal consumer practices. Industrial religion then might offer processes by which communities learn to need the production, differentiation, and selection of goods for the service of higher powers. To substantiate these claims, though, would require a more comprehensive study of those ritual processes; a study perhaps akin to sociologist Christian Smith's sweeping description, which draws on social movements theory, of the secularization of American public life as a contested and ongoing process involving a variety of social actors and strategic relationships (Smith 2003). industrial religion identifies this overlap between religious practice and economic habit, suggesting that religion and economy cannot be delineated cleanly or reduced to the agency of the consumer/believer (or, inversely, the hegemony of the producer/preacher). This approach would build on the work of De Certeau, who described a marginality of a majority of consumers who do not produce culture but reassign it meaning and value through tactics of practice (De Certeau 1984: xvi-xviii). 7The "businessman's awakening" (1857-1858), for instance, promoted spiritual answers to crises in the financial marketplace through noontime prayer meetings sponsored by local merchants (Corrigan 2001). In another example, the Federal Council of Churches of Christ in America prepared a series of mandates in 1908 responding to modern industry, seeking to bring social consciousness to the forefront of the new industrial order. And since the late nineteenth century, proponents of a "prosperity gospel" (from Russell H. Conwell to Joel Osteen) have argued that financial success and personal industry were external signs of God's favor. These examples demonstrate that within the context of American Protestantism, religion and industry often have been collaborators and mutual instigators to profitable ends, both spiritual and material.</page><page sequence="5">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 5 Surveys of U.S. religious history have focused most intensely on the relationship between increased industrialization and the need for greater social services through reform societies and political parties, like Orestes Brownson's Workingman's Party. In such surveys, indi- vidual men of industry (Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller) could be spotlighted for their generous donations to Christian causes and institutions. But within American religious studies as a whole, confluences between industry and religion have been read ironically or critically, rather than emblematic of a patterned relationship.8 This is despite pronounced images like those deployed in William Warren Sweet's The Story of Religions in America (1930), where Sweet wrote: "Previously Baptists and Methodists had been proud to call them- selves the poor man's church. They now began to boast of their wealth, to talk of the 'sanctification' of wealth, and to speak of it as 'consecrated power'." Archives and synthetic texts speak to the entan- glement of industrial metaphor even as scholars, wary of reducing religion to economy (or economy to religion), often fail to account for the co-creation of wealth and worship; or, indeed, for the paral- lels between market sectors and missionary maps, between the rec- ommendations of social reform and the virtues promised by advertised products. "Until industry takes up its cross with the self-sacrificing passion of religion, neither labor nor capital, employee nor employer, can really come into their own," explained Graham Taylor, professor of social economics at the Chicago Theological Seminary in 1908, "Unless reli- gion transforms its cross into terms of economic value and of industrial relationships, it can never hold its supremacy over human life in an industrial age" (Taylor 1908: 104). Examining religion, or industry, in the wake of such postulates requires something more ambiguous than simple reclamation. There is no pure subject "industry" any more than there is an ideal reduction of the "religious." To study allegories of industrial religion is, then, to examine not the religion of industry, but the religious practices of secularization, the ways ostensibly secular 8Prominent exceptions to this statement were produced as social criticism. Liston Pope described the reciprocal relationship between factory and church in Gastonia, NC, in his classic Millhands and Preachers ([1942] 1965). Historian Anthony F. C. Wallace published Rockdale: An American Village in the Early Industrial Revolution, which surveyed the development of an "industrial Christianity" in a Pennsylvania town in the first half of the nineteenth century (1978). Historian Paul E. Johnson argued in A Shopkeeper's Millennium: Society and Revivals in Rochester, New York, 1815-1837 that the religious revivals of Charles Finney in Rochester New York in the 1830s served the interests of business owners and managers, as well as an emerging evangelical middle-class, but not the collective good of society (1978).</page><page sequence="6">6 Journal of the American Academy of Religion industries produced their own conversionist creeds and rituals requisite for the success of their sale, and the moral production of their moder- nity.9 This was done through product promotion, satellite lobbies, and charismatic personalities, processes, and activities weaving between tropes of secularization and Protestantism. "Industrial religion" in its every incarnation involved an allegory that intertwined material power, techniques of conversion, and cultures of consumption. "Allegory" here is an intentioned choice. Presenting them under this auspice suggests comparison. Each of these extended metaphors share a common geography (United States), common hundred-year epochal chronology (mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries), and a common emphasis on product promotion (coal, soap, and Southern goods). They also entail the archival exploration of satel- lite industrial lobbies, evidenced institutionally in the Cleanliness Institute and the Southern Industrial Relations Conference and strategi- cally in the corporate efforts of Appalachian businessmen. In addition, they include at least one individual charismatic personality preaching on behalf of an industrial outfit seeking sanctification for a capital project through the rituals and epistemological advantages of Christian discourse. Collecting them here as a trio emphasizes the different angles of a strikingly consistent market procedure. These narratives are struc- tured allegorically, to illustrate how industrial religion functions as an interactive and interwoven engagement between tropes of secularization and Protestantism. They do not offer a sequential story of industrial religion, but represent high watermarks in its predominantly Protestant expression in the continental United States. As such, these allegories of industry do not attribute a correlative relationship between the sign (coal) and the signified (salvation), or the image (industry) and its meaning (modern sanctification). Such flat symbolic readings are eschewed here in favor of allegorical ones. "Allegory transforms the phenomenon into a concept, the concept into an image, but in such a way that the concept remains nevertheless still contained in the image so that it can be entirely held and possessed and expressed in it," offered Goethe.10 Friedrich Schlegel elaborates: "at the root of the allegory [we find this imperative]: Make perceptible all that is spirituaF (Schlegel 1957: 221). Allegory captures our dual attempt to emulate historical materiality while pursuing trans-historical insight. Industrial religion describes a mechanism that does not need 9Here we refer to newer descriptions of secularization which mark the Protestant intonations of its public practice. This was the point of Casanova (1994), Fessenden (2007), and Modern (2007). 1T)Quoted in Todorov (1982: 205).</page><page sequence="7">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 7 archival particularity to make it so; it makes itself, over and again, in lived, symbolic, discursive, profane, and propagandistic ways. Thus, we deploy "allegory" in the sense described by Talal Asad when he argued, through Walter Benjamin, that it was the "appropriate mode for appre- hending this world" since it offered a "form of expression" to articulate just how reigning operations seek "desperately to control an unruly world" (Asad 2003: 64-65).11 These allegories of industrial religion both represent, and were pro- duced by, the conflict between secularity and sacrality which pressed them into the study of religion. Religious idiom and religious ritual were requisite to visions of industrial effort. The discourse of progress attached to the material objects coal, rayon, and soap was repeated and reiterated in the packaging and imagining of other products, like food- stuffs, automobiles, electronics, and disposable commodities for the salving of the self and the sculpting of the body. Which is to say: this is not a history. This is a proposal for new histories of religion, for the American religious study of commodity. THE POWER OF COAL Coal was the essential fuel that powered the machineries of industry. But as a construct of industrial religion, coal powered progress itself, firing the imagination to visions of human potential and the salvations of modern civilization. At once substance and symbol, coal's power entwined matter and spirit in a particularly modern manner, congealing multiple meanings of progress into one enchanted material. Writer James Lane Allen provides a glimpse of coal's near-apocalyptic power in his description of a journey to the Cumberland Gap on the mountainous border of Virginia and Kentucky in the 1880s. Like many who visited these central Appalachian mountains on the threshold of the development of industrial coal mining, Allen carried with him a sense of wonder and anticipatory nostalgia. As he stood in the midst of what would soon become the central Appalachian coal field, he wit- nessed a parade of ghosts. "Amid the deepening shadows of the twilight and the solemn repose of the mighty landscape," he reported in 11 Asad takes this description from Walter Benjamin, in Trauerspiel: "Allegory expresses well the uncontrollable, indeterminable, and yet material world of the baroque princely court with its intrigue, betrayal, and murder. In brief, this world is 'secular' not because scientific knowledge has replaced religious belief (that is, because the 'real' has at last become apparent) but because, on the contrary, it must be lived in uncertainly, without fixed moorings even for the believer, a world in which the real and the imaginary mirror each other. In this world the politics of certainty is clearly impossible."</page><page sequence="8">8 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Harper's Magazine in 1866, "the Gap seemed to be crowded with two invisible and countless pageants of human life, the one passing in, the other passing out," and "the air grew thick with ghostly utterances." Passing in was modern civilization, and passing out were the ways of mountain folk. For Allen, the impending development of the Appalachian coal industry offered two possible futures to mountain communities: as he put it, "to be swept out of these mountains by the in-rushing spirit of contending industries, or to be aroused, civilized, and developed" (1886: 66).12 Allen was one among many writers for popular periodicals at the end of the nineteenth century who, along with folklorists, sociologists, and anthropologists, described the "strange land and a peculiar people" of central Appalachia as subjects frozen in time, having been isolated from the regular flow of migration, commerce, and development impacting and connecting the rest of the country throughout the nine- teenth century (Harney 1873). Here is how one visitor described his experience in central Appalachia in 1882: I have made personal experience ... in a visit of two months to the mountain region of Kentucky. I was there so shut off from the nine- teenth century that it was like a dream to think that beyond that mountain barrier, existed a contemporaneous world, full of ideas, pro- jects, motion. And now, how like a dream it is, to think that in the heart of this world exists that other, of men who have never heard the shriek of an engine, the click of the telegraph, the whirr of machinery; of men who, in many cases, neither read nor write, who never take a newspaper, and who often can barely count ten. These are the "no account" people, the "poor white trash." (1882: 688) Nearly thirty years later, an anthropologist described the same area in similar terms, as stuck 100 years in the past: In one of the most progressive and productive countries in the world, and in that section of the country which has had its civilization and 12The imaginary of central Appalachia has a particular history, but it should also be understood as a particular instance of a more general religious pattern in American history that would include the concept of "Manifest Destiny" and the problematic relationship between technology and nature so aptly described by Leo Marx in his canonical The Machine in the Garden: Technology and the Pastoral Ideal in America (1964) and David E. Nye in America as Second Creation: Technology and Narratives of New Beginnings (2003). In this sense, central Appalachian story and the history of practices and discourses related to it are themselves allegories of a larger American problematic concerning constructions and contradictions of nature, technology, progress, and destiny. Coal, as a crystallization of these tensions, provides a glimpse into their productive power.</page><page sequence="9">13For excellent studies of this nineteenth-century literature depicting the "otherness" of Appalachian people, society, and culture, see Batteau (1990), Billings et al. (1999), McNeil (1995), and Shapiro (1978). Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 9 wealth the longest, we find a large area where the people are still living the frontier life of the backwoods, where civilization is that of the eighteenth century. These backwoods people are to be found through- out the broad belt of the Southern Appalachians, but nowhere in such purity or covering so large an area as in the mountain region of Kentucky. (Semple 1901: 561) Other writers turned the clock back farther, finding Appalachian resi- dents speaking Elizabethan English and practicing folkways that were preserved unchanged from the English and Irish countryside. In some respects, the perceived culture of the mountains was considered quaint, a living museum, and a source for collectors of folklore and folksong to gather artifacts thought to be extinct or soon to be so. But in other respects, mountain life served as a measure of how far modern civiliza- tion had progressed. Certainly, for antimodernists like those studied by historian T. J. Jackson Lears, this measure found modernity coming up short (1981). But for many others, including the champions of the coal industry, modern civilization was far more desirable than the picture the mountains presented of an earlier time. If modern civilization cele- brated self-determination and freedom from ignorance and superstition, then Appalachia served as its antithesis. This can be seen especially clearly in representations of religious life in the mountains- or rather, its lack. While the mountains did not lack for churches, the overwhelm- ing image of religion in the mountains was one of ignorant emotional- ism with little to no spiritual discipline or moral influence.13 Anthropogeographer Ellen Churchill Semple found in the eastern Kentucky mountains a people who were "by nature reverential," since "the impressive beauty and grandeur of the natural surroundings appeals to the spiritual in man." Yet, she wrote that their religion was dogmatic, elemental, and had "little or no influence on the morals of everyday life." It was a non-rational reverence of natural forces, and formal church worship was "emotional and little suggestive of a basis in rationalism" (1901: 583-584). A "fatalistic tendency" pervaded Appalachian life that was also, she thought, the result of the proximity with which people lived in relation to nature. Religious ideas indigenous to the mountains strengthened this tendency, according to Semple, and stood in the way of its overcoming by condemning missions and Sunday schools "as gratuitous meddling with the affairs of Providence."</page><page sequence="10">10 Journal of the American Academy of Religion As a representative example of such fatalism, Semple pointed to the ready acceptance of death as something inevitable and predestined to the point where there was no effort to fight it. Berea College president William Goodell Frost echoed her perception, writing "The mountains seem the natural home of fatalism. It is in helplessness that they cry out beside the bedside of their dear one, 'If he's to die, he's to die.' And this 'hardshell' predestinarÃ­an teaching does not hesitate to condemn mis- sions and Sunday-schools as an unwarrantable interference with the decrees of the Almighty" (Frost 1899: 317). Moreover, visitors to the mountains reported that inhabitants held an enchanted view of nature and its processes. Reports regaled outsiders with primitivist pictures of mountain folk and their astrological insights, using astrological signs to guide planting and harvesting, and herbs and charms to heal human malady.14 This was the backdrop against which James Lane Allen scripted his industrial religious vision of the future of the coal fields. If the moun- tains were the antithesis of modernity, it was because they had been iso- lated from the flow of progress and history. If the bubble of isolation could be pierced, the mountains would inevitably be swept up into his- tory's flow. The retarded frontier would pass into modern civilization. And coal was the power that would drive this transformation. Extending the language of flow, retardation, and mountain barriers, one common explanation of the mechanism by which coal would bring progress and create civilization highlighted the importance of railroads and markets as modes of circulation. With the railroads would come a market, from which would come "a sense of a wider world, a motive to labor for more than daily bread. [The railroads'] very existence will carry a motion and a thrill to the heart of every region within hearing- range of their shrieking engines; they will teach what education and business are worth- the ideas of men and the use of the world" (Anonymous 1882: 691). This reading of the mountains, then, imagined commerce and the railroad in almost magical terms, their presence alone breaking the spell that nature had over the people. Through the flow of commerce the mountains would be rejoined to the larger national body and the stream of progress. Religion and industry were entangled in this vision. As social worker Olive Dame Campbell wrote in 1925, two types of people were especially drawn to the hills in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, "those who saw McCauley (1995) provides a critical history of representations of Appalachian mountain religion, and a corrective religious history of the region.</page><page sequence="11">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 11 the natural resources and sought them regardless of the interests of the natural owners; and those who with missionary zeal rushed in to educate and reform" (Campbell 1925: 11). Perhaps the most striking representation of coal's power to produce civilization out of primitivism was depicted in a mural commissioned by the land speculator John C. C. Mayo for his Kentucky mansion. From 1892 to 1907, Mayo acquired 700,000 acres of land in eastern Kentucky. This land would become a major foundation for central Appalachian coal industry. The mural consisted of a sequence of pictures. In the first picture, a giant anthropomorphic figure was chained beneath the ground by a stratum of coal. In the next, the figure awoke, freed by the mining of coal, and in the third picture, the figure trod the land "with transforming power." According to a description of the mural written in 1921, "from the Ohio to the Breaks of Sandy, the record of his prowess was told in brick and stone. Cities arose as if by magic. Imposing business houses soon stood beside more ornate temples of Divine Worship. Hundreds of dwellings of happy, contented people appeared."15 Note the simplicity of the process. Once unleashed, the power of coal created cities, commerce, religion, homes, and happiness. No mess, no pain, no labor. There is something striking about Mayo's mural and its mythic anthropomorphizing of mineral power. At the same time that Appalachian culture was being represented as superstitiously misrecog- nizing causal relations and endowing natural objects with supernatural forces that they do not posses, Mayo's mural did the same. But is not the mural only symbolic, one might ask, while the mountain resident really believed that a charm could stop bleeding, or that the phase of the moon had an effect on the growth of potatoes? Of course, the mural is art, a symbolic representation of an idea. But that idea was firmly embedded in the multivalent meanings of industrial "development." Coal contained a surplus value beyond its power to produce heat and surpassing its power to produce profit. In the realm of industrial religion, coal also carried the power to produce modern civilization and "progress." The multiple meanings of power congealed in coal were not only a source for artistic inspiration. They could also stimulate curious behav- ior around the material substance of coal itself. Photographs of coal company officials and investors posing before seams of coal have a surreal aura about them, wealthy men in suits and ties posing in the mountains, often in forests, beside rock formations, looking pleased and full of anticipation. In a recurring practice, large rectangular blocks of 15John C. C. Mayo College, Annual Catalog, 1921-1922.</page><page sequence="12">12 Journal of the American Academy of Religion coal were carefully cut from seams so that they could be displayed at world expositions- this was in contrast to the usual, practical method of blasting the seam apart and shoveling pieces into a car for transpor- tation to the tipple where they would be loaded into train cars to head to electrical plants, coke ovens, or steel mills. Such exhibitions of block coal made a totemic spectacle of its pure physical presence over and above its use value as a source of energy (or even its exchange value as invested commodity). These displays were not limited to faraway world's fairs, as coal also appeared as an object of extraordinary pres- ence in many central Appalachian commercial sites. In Middlesboro, KY, for example, the Bell County Chamber of Commerce is housed in a small building constructed of blocks of coal in 1926. The Tug Valley Chamber of Commerce in Williamson, WV, is in a similar structure, built in 1933. In Baxter, KY, a monumental pillar of coal stands in the middle of the main street into town. In these displays of the sheer mate- riality of the substance of coal itself, and its related aura of power, one is reminded of fetishism. Was this not a form of enchantment, to per- ceive so much power in a rock? But to signify coal as fetish is to raise a host of questions about what sort of religious work was going on in the imagination of indus- trial development. William Pietz's well-known series of articles on the history of the concept of the fetish convincingly shows that the fetish is not a stable thing in the world, but a site of conflict and controversy over social relations, meaning, value, and authenticity (Pietz 1985, 1987, 1988). As David Chidester has summarized it, "the fetish is not an object; it is a subject of arguments about meaning and value in human relations" (2005: 42). The concept of the fetish draws attention to the ways that material objects may hold, conceal, or reveal power and sig- nificance in and through their specificity and particularity. In the case of coal, multiple interwoven meanings of power in which coal played a part were congealed in the physical substance of the mineral. It all added up to more than the sum of its parts- to a surplus of meaning that overflowed the ability of the material substance to carry a contain- able, graspable signification. The only presentation adequate to convey- ing its abundance of value was the physical substance of the coal itself. Karl Marx famously articulated how fetishism, in the world of com- modities, conceals the concrete social relations that constitute the field through which value and power are produced, negotiated, and circu- lated. The coal- fetish certainly achieved much of its power by erasing the human labor required for its extraction. Indeed, it inverted the relation of human value to material value, portraying the former as deriving from the latter. But there is something about the enchantment of coal and</page><page sequence="13">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 13 development that does not disappear when critical leverage is applied. It refuses to be explained away, signaling the crucial co-constitutive nature of industrial religion's secular mode of enchantment. The power of coal shaped even the language of missionaries, who had a somewhat ambivalent relationship with the coal industry Missionaries tended to accept the general thesis that the mountains had been a barrier to civilization and progress, and that economic develop- ment would benefit Appalachian people, bringing them into the flow of history. But missionaries and social workers were hesitant to put their full faith in the power of commerce alone to produce civic virtue. Astutely aware of the ability of industry to corrupt by instilling greed and desire, and wary of the dirty and run-down conditions associated with urban industrial settings, social and religious work in the moun- tains, at churches and especially in settlement schools, focused on instil- ling good work discipline and hygienic, orderly habits of living (see Whisnant 1983: 68-78, for example). Time and again they wrote of the process of religious and social training in terms that equated their human subjects with rocks, undergoing a process similar to that of industrial coal refinement. For instance, Cora Wilson Stewart, creator of the Moonlight Schools in Kentucky's mountains, spoke often on the topic of "Our Mountain Jewels," arguing that Kentucky's mountain children were like rough diamonds who only needed the polish of edu- cation to make them priceless gems.16 Other examples could be found in the American Missionary Association Magazine: But there are men in these mountains as well as minerals, and industry digs them out to separate them, and to transform those who are fit unto better things. (American Missionary Association Magazine 1908: 109) You have [in the mountain children] all that is necessary to build on and rightly develop a well-rounded character. The one thing needed is, to reach them, bless them educationally, to polish under the skilled touch of mental lapidisi these rough stones. Will they endure, submit to the polishing? Yes, even if the hammer and chisel be called into operation. No pupils in my knowledge delight more in having made smooth the rough places. (Spence 1903: 13) If modern industry and organized religion shared a common grammar, then it is worth noting that, at least in central Appalachia, the influence 16Undated and untitled newspaper clipping, Stewart Papers (box 29); "Our Mountain Jewels," Stewart Papers (box 46), Appalachian Collection, University of Kentucky.</page><page sequence="14">14 Journal of the American Academy of Religion was not unidirectional. If the idiom of miraculous transformation shaped the meaning and representation of coal and industrial develop- ment, then the work of Protestant missionaries was no less shaped by the idiom of mineral refinement. Which idiom was dominant? Which source of power, religious or industrial, defined the transformative work taking place in the mountains? Is this even the right question? Notions of industrial development, human development, transformation, and progress were so interwoven, it would seem, that they could hardly be thought in separation from each other. Such is the mixture of secular and sacred in industrial religion; an ambivalent relationship, surely, but . mutually defining nonetheless. THE MIRACLE OF CONVERSION There was no greater exponent of the discourse of industrial religion in the American South than Baptist minister and industrial chaplain George D. Heaton. For over five decades, from the 1940s through the 1990s, Heaton instructed manufacturers on how to increase worker pro- ductivity through Christ-like management strategies. Heaton delivered speeches for corporate-sponsored events and collaborated with compa- nies to develop theological curriculum in industrial chaplaincy.17 Though he worked primarily in the southern states, he attended national society meetings, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, in cities like Chicago and Philadelphia; he read widely, from journals and books on industry and business; and he served as Director of Crozer Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania.18 Working regionally, but connected nationally, Heaton represented a broader theological turn in a New South rebuilt through factory production and product consumption. In his theological prescriptions, Heaton echoed the call of Methodist minister Atticus Haygood, who declared in 1880 that southern Protestants should "cultivate industry and economy, 17For an example of what seems an endless list of appearances, see Heaton's presentation for the American Cast Iron Pipe Company in Birmingham, AL. Heaton, May 25, 1952, "A Tribute to John J. Eagan," delivered at the American Cast Iron Pipe Company, Birmingham, AL. In George D. Heaton Collection. One example of Heaton's reading of industrial journals is illustrated in his attempt to use the "Dupont-Hobsell" course at Crozer Seminary. Crozer also was one of the key sites for Heaton's efforts to develop theological curriculum in industrial chaplaincy. There he worked with companies such as the Pugh Shipbuilding Dry Dock Company, Sun Oil Company, and Scott Tissue Company and the faculty of Crozer "to do some real experimental work in a more adequate training for ministers for an understanding of industry and our economy."

This professed faith in industry was indicative of an industrial reli- gion that cut across regional boundaries and theological camps, even as it was used in the South by figures like Haygood and Heaton to resur- rect the region and project a particular strand of evangelical theology onto the rest of the nation. If anything, Heaton's theology demonstrates that the religious promotion of a triumphant capitalism was not peculiar to the northern region, nor was its celebration confined to one side of the theological aisle. 9 Take for example, "Miracles of Supervision," a speech Heaton deliv- ered in 1949 to southern industrialists and factory supervisors congre- gated in Robert E. Lee Hall, a magnificent structure with towering white columns on the grounds of the Blue Ridge Y.M.C.A. in Asheville, NC. In what was the keynote address to the Southern Industrial Relations Conference (SIRC), Heaton described the first miracle of Jesus, turning water into wine at a wedding in Cana of Galilee, as the "basic miracle of the whole industrial process."20 Heaton observed that just as Jesus 19Heaton represents a type of historical figure in the New South that has been for the most part left out of the historiography, which has been more attentive to either the loud voices of Lost Cause ministers or the quietly active southern progressives who resemble liberal Protestants of the north. On the former, see Berends (2004), Foster (1987), and Wilson (1980). On the latter, several studies have been written about Willis Duke Weatherford, who served as president of the Blue Ridge Assembly from 1906 to 1944. The Blue Ridge Assembly, though, also was home to the Southern Industrial Relations Conference, where Heaton served as conference chaplain. Yet Seales has been unable to find any studies of Heaton or the Southern Industrial Relations Conference. For references to Weatherford, see Mjagkij (2003: 103-105), Boles (2002: 399), Link (1992: 251), Luker (1998: 181, 188, 216, 281-282, 323), and Antone (1969). 20While Heaton made public appearances throughout the region, the SIRC was his most consistent venue. Heaton got his start in industrial chaplaincy while serving as a pastor in Paducah, KY, where in 1939 he helped settle a hosiery mill strike.

Heaton, December 3, 1963, "Address to The Aiken Foundation." In George D. Heaton Collection. Heaton was so popular that he was invited back every year after, until he passed away in 1996. In all, he delivered the keynote address and morning devotionals at fifty-seven consecutive conferences. Today, a monument stands in his honor and a building has been named in his memory on the Blue Ridge Assembly grounds. Organized in 1919, the Conference was first known as the "The Southern Conference on Human Relations in Industry," a development program of the Industrial Division of the Y.M.C.A. According to a "Historical Sketch" by T. M. Forbes in the 1958 program, the Conference "grew steadily" through the "roaring twenties" and its annual meetings were "well attended from representatives from all over the South." Forbes remarked that the Program Committee members included "some of the great southern industrial executives who helped to build the foundation for the remarkable manufacturing economy that exists in the South today." While the Conference "had</page><page sequence="16">16 Journal of the American Academy of Religion gathered men, pots, and water, managed his resources, and produced a needed good for the people to consume, supervisors "do the same thing day after day in many varieties of industry." Having "seen the need of clothing, of machinery, of construction materials, of airplanes, of aluminum- all met by the miracles performed through supervision," the southern preacher declared industrial production "as miraculous a thing as modern life witnesses" (Heaton 1949: 2). In his speeches, Heaton translated the language of the New Testament for industrial application. For example, in an address deliv- ered to the North Carolina Cotton Manufacturers Association in Charlotte on November 10, 1944, Heaton took 1 Corinthians 13:13, "And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love," and restated it as, "These days will require much of us. There are these three- machines, materials, and men- but the greatest of these is men."21 This kind of translation was typical of Heaton. For him, the parables and stories of the New Testament were as much models for industrial practice as they were spiritual habit. For example, in his 1953 address to the SIRC, entitled "A Study in Bad Leadership," Heaton admitted that, "All of my material for this [talk] comes from a study of a group of people in the life of Jesus who had opportunities for great leadership and failed. They were called the Pharisees." Heaton goes on to compare the mistakes of those Pharisees to "the mistakes that I see supervisor making in plant after plant that I visit throughout all of the territory that is represented by this Conference."22 In Heaton's reading, factory supervisors, like Jesus with the Pharisees, should correct the mistakes of bad leadership. Consistent in his speeches, Heaton frequently invoked Jesus as model supervisor.23 This invocation resonated throughout his 1949 its troubles during the depression years of the Thirties," as Forbes recounted, it regained its strength in the 1940s, prospered during the post- WWII industrial boom, and persists in its most recent form, The Blue Ridge Conference on Leadership, which is managed by the College of Business at Auburn University, Alabama. The Conference claims to be the "oldest and largest meeting of its kind in the southeastern United States."

Heaton described the story of Jesus helping his disciples catch fish by telling them where to cast their nets as "the miracle of redirecting the efforts of men so that those efforts resulted in a definite improvement in productive capacity." Heaton interpreted the story of Jesus healing the paralyzed man who was brought to him on a bed, lowered through a roof by four men, as "the story of one man who was able by the miracle of Jesus to do what four men were required for doing beforehand." Heaton saw the story of Jesus healing the man with a withered hand as an example where "Jesus saw the opportunity to take this man and to alter his physical condition so that he could become productive." In each description, Jesus increases production. And in each interpretation, Heaton instructed the factory supervisor to go and do likewise. Heaton's message of Jesus as the model of industrial and econ- omic behavior was widely distributed through his public talks and based on letters addressed to him, positively received by attendees.24 In addition to his annual appearance at the SIRC, and his partici- pation at industrial companies, manufacturing conferences, and seminary luncheons, Heaton delivered "economic curriculum" to local congregations. For example, on December 3, 1963, Heaton gave a featured address on the "Mutual Influence of Industry and Community" at the First Presbyterian Church in Florence, SC, as part of a five-day program of the Family Life Institute entitled, "A Study in How We Live." Both the institute and the program were funded by "The Aiken Foundation," developed by J. Boone Aiken, a southern industrialist from Florence. The goal of the institute, as described inside the program pamphlet, was to "encourage leadership and progress in the material, cultural and spiritual growth of the city [of Florence] and its people." And this goal was visually displayed on the pamphlet cover, in an image that featured a white family of 24For example, many attendees to the SIRC considered Heaton's annual address the highlight of the program. Heaton received numerous letters praising his speeches. In a hand-written letter dated July 23, 1961, Ronald Hayes, a self-described layman at First Baptist Church Dublin, Georgia, wrote to Dr. Heaton requesting "a written copy of your talks made at Blue Ridge ... so that I could read them over again and again." B. Rhett Turnipseed, Personnel Director for Pacolet Mfg. Co., Plant #4 of New Holland, GA, wrote in a typed letter to Heaton, "By every standard of measurement you have earned one of the greatest reputations for inspiring men to seek the good things in life." And in a correspondence dated April 9, 1948, E. G. Wilson, Executive Secretary of the SIRC, forwarded the following quote from "the Armstrong Cork people" to Heaton: "Thank you very much for sending me a copy of last year's Conference proceedings. It certainly is very interesting and I enjoyed very much reading Dr. Heaton's address. Some years ago in Chicago at the AMA Convention I thought he was the hit of the whole program." In George D.

Those abstract concepts were addressed programmatically in evening discussion groups- on the Economics of Family Living, These Changing Times, Principles of Our Economic System, History and Heritage, and The American Idea of Freedom- that preceded the featured addresses. On this occasion, Heaton served as pastoral care giver, religiously construct- ing economic meaning for lay participants. Over the many years of his industrial ministry, Heaton preached a remarkably consistent theology. From beginning to end, Heaton emphasized individual freedom expressed through personal relation- ships within communities of common spirit. He was opposed on prin- ciple to labor unions, arguing that they eroded personal relationships by giving too much authority to union representation. In one of his earliest speeches to the SIRC, Heaton referred to unionized labor as "the fetish of collective bargaining." He hoped that American Industry would throw "overboard" that "fetish" and replace it with "collective agree- ment." Heaton suggested that "people never become friends through bargaining."25 And he based that assessment on a particular interpret- ation of New Testament text. For Heaton, the life of Jesus described in the Gospels encouraged personal relationship over institutional authority. Despite his objection to the collective representation of labor unions, that "fetish of collective bargaining," Heaton imbued the industrial supervisor with a specific type of organizational authority. For Heaton, supervisors managed the mechanisms of material conver- sion at the local level of the factory. In turn, that management of raw materials and human resources were the visible signs of the miracu- lous power of industrial production. In his 1949 address to the SIRC, Heaton described the raw materials of industry, from chemical fluids to cotton, as the "elements" that the supervisor, like Jesus with the water, transformed into a new substance. He instructed his audience that it "takes a supervisor to step into a situation, and to bring together a group of men, some materials and some machinery, and so put these things together that a chemical fluid comes out as rayon, or a piece of cloth comes out sanforized, or crude bales of cotton 25Heaton.

For Heaton, the authority of the supervisor came from knowing how to use the miracle of industry. Through proper training, the factory supervisor uses the methods of manage- ment to increase productivity. In Heaton's prescriptions, the supervi- sor works in the image of Christ. The emphasis on Christ-like management of "human relations in industry" pervaded Heaton's speeches at the SIRC throughout his tenure as conference chaplain. In the hand- written notes for his 1995 address to the SIRC, Heaton wrote, "Human relationship is the major problem of industry."26 Those notes are filled with somber reflections on historical events in the United States since the early years of the Conference, from "The Big Depression [of the] 1930s" to "The Tragedy in Vietnam" to "Race Riots [in] Atlanta, Chicago, [and] Detroit." There are references to Kierkegaard and phrases such as "When small men cast long shadows it is a sure sign the sun is setting." Heaton justified such pessimism with reference to "current trends in out of wedlock births, crime, drug use, family disintegration, [and] educational decline." Yet, despite those perceived obstacles, Heaton remained hopeful. In his notes, he listed those social changes under the lower case heading "big changes," which contrasted his invocation written in upper case that "The Big Change is inside us." Though he never refer- enced Jesus by name, at least not in his notes, his message was the same as that preached in the early 1940s. He wrote, "The greatest thing in industry is the human factor [and] the greatest thing in [the] human factor is spirit; [the] chief problem in human factor is relationship [and the] chief problem of human relationships is to beget good will." Even when recounting challenges past and present, Heaton continued to look ahead. His was a message of hope in the improvement of human relations in industry, a hope in progress, a hope in the Big Change inside all believers. From his first to his last sermon at the SIRC, he professed a Protestant faith in industrial practice. For Heaton, both reli- gion and industry had the power to change present conditions, whether from sinner to saved or raw material to consumer good. In contrast to Thomas Smith's excision of religion, Heaton conjoined religious pre- scription with industrial method. In the works and words of Jesus the Good Supervisor, Heaton found his model of productivity, his allegory of progress. 26In George D. Heaton Collection.</page><page sequence="20">20 Journal of the American Academy of Religion THE CONSUMPTION OF CLEANLINESS Whereas George Heaton promoted the techniques of industrial con- version modeled by Jesus in an effort to increase productivity, adverti- sers in the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries developed their own techniques of conversion to win customers, sell soap, and promote consumption. In the 1870s, soap was seen as an optional accessory to daily life; by the 1930s, soap ranked second to food as the most impor- tant product in people's home. How, in a sixty-year period, did a single industry transform the bathing imagination of an entire nation? In order to sell soap, manufacturers had to compel consumers to a certain definition of cleanliness.27 While consumer acts are, always, adjudicated as much as by the purchaser, the historical shift in expenditure and sen- sibility encourages rumination on the sources of mass consumption (Blaszczyk 2002). In 1870, cleanliness might have been next to godliness (an axiom popularized through the sermons of John Wesley), but clean- liness was not accessorized by God-sanctioned soap. Clergy of the ante- bellum period favored cleanliness to promote not piety but Christian respectability, and eventually, health. But the construction of this tidy Protestant only required hot water, ironed clothes, and a rigorous moral posture. How then did soap become requisite for American perfection? A religious history of American bathing practices would take several factors into account.28 First, leading U.S. Protestant clergyman increas- ingly came under the rhetorical sway of print advertising culture, incor- porating the popular iconographie lexicon for Pear's or Lifebuoy soap bars into their weekly exegesis. Likewise, advertisers borrowed from Christian iconography, using the presumed Protestantism of the American public sphere to effective indoctrinating advantage. Meanwhile reform movements enfolded into their city-cleaning cru- sades emphases on Social Purity and Social Hygiene, expelling prostitu- tion and germs with the same millennial zeal. Just as immigrants flooded urban harbors with religious plurality, a variety of agencies and individuals, including mayors, eugenicists, and social scientists, com- prised a Protestant public calling for racial assimilation and a gilded middle class. 27For more on the history of cleanliness in the West, see Ashenburg (2007), Hoy (1996), Sivulka (1997, 2001), Smith (2007), and Wright (1960). 28For a parallel study of turn-of-the-century Canadian reformers and their promotions of cleanliness, see Valverde (2008).</page><page sequence="21">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 21 With home missions extolling the combined power of whiteness and civility, manufacturers capitalized upon a purity infused with Biblical reference. Ivory Soap, for example, took its name from a spring 1879 sermon heard by Harley Proctor at the Church of Our Savior in Cincinnati: "All thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia out of ivory palaces whereby they have made thee glad" (Psalm 45). Proctor and Gamble's first ad for this new product was printed on December 21, 1882, in a Christian weekly, The Independent. Ivory suds propagated not only cleanliness, but also holiness: a color and a principle tied up in a new wave of national sale. By 1890, 30 million cakes of Ivory were bought annually (Vinikas 1989: 614). Proctor and Gamble embraced Progressive era Protestantism as a collusive industrial force. In 1896, leading Social Gospel theologian Washington Gladden (1836-1918) was invited to speak on "The Relations of Capital and Labor" at the seven- teenth semi-annual dividend meeting of Proctor and Gamble. "The relations which subsist between employer and employees in Ivorydale, between the directing minds and helping hands, are the kind of relations that I wish to see everywhere between these classes," cooed Gladden.29 For Gladden, for tabernacle preachers, and for new advertis- ing agencies eager to launch their sale, the bar became a cleansing object of Christian purity, a repeatable baptism for sin and soot-soaked cities. Gladden's praising lecture on Proctor's Christian industrial prac- tices presses a more specifically institutional explanation for the success of soap in market culture. We refer here to the industrial religion concomitantly created by soap promoters and religious refor- mers in an effort to profit from an exclusively desirable product pur- chased by a particularly impure sort of civilized consumer. John H. Woodbury Company, for example, began in the 1880s a "Facial Purity League," proposing in its ads the moral purity possible through facial cleansers. Included in their onslaught were campaign buttons and membership contracts describing in vivid Christian language the connection between soap and moral worth, between purchase and regeneration. B. T. Babbitt of Babbitt's Best Soap mimicked this tactic, ascribing a Christian collector's value to soap wrappers. Any consumer who submitted twenty-five wrappers received a panel picture, often a Biblical scene. The first rebates in modern advertising were offered in 1898 when Wool Soap joined 29 Addresses of Washington Gladden, D.D. and Hon. Benjamin Butterworth on the Occasion of the Seventeenth Semi-Annual Dividend Meeting at Ivorydale, Ohio, February 3, 1896, p. 6.</page><page sequence="22">22 Journal of the American Academy of Religion forced with the Women's Christian Temperance Union. The WCTU received a penny apiece for its Chicago temple every time someone remitted a Wool Soap wrapper to the firm (Vinikas 1989: 615). These data represent the ways specific soap companies connected product promotions with Christian entertainment and social reform in an epoch ripe with potential markets - from settlement houses in urban centers to faraway missionary fields in foreign lands- yet lacking the consumers. These competitive ploys to attract consumer attention mirrored a moment when Protestants became increasingly aware of multiple religious contestations to their Christian majority. The shopper's emergent buffet, like the array shown at the 1893 World's Parliament, enticed producers, both ecclesiastical and manu- facturing, to consider their spot on the emporium's shelf. The postulated absence of the compulsory (no one had to be any single sort of Christian, or buy any one project) necessitated the incul- cation of the compulsive by the producer, with public rituals transfig- ured into advertising campaigns that goaded private habits. No single operation offered better training in the habits of the voluntary consu- mer than the Cleanliness Institute, founded in June 1927. Born in a decade of dipping soap sales (declines attributable in part to the diversi- fication of the cosmetics marketplace), the Cleanliness Institute rep- resents the total marriage of a common moral didacticism with a secular medical salvation. Organized by the Association of American Soap and Glycerin Producers, the Cleanliness Institute was a trade association formed to protect their market and promote the consump- tion of their product. It was a satellite church of soap's industrial reli- gion. "Backed by the leading soap makers, it has the distinct object of encouraging the use of soap," announced the Omaha Bee.30 Member companies manufactured over 80 percent of the soap used in the United States and created a $500,000 endowment to fund its edu- cational endeavors. The cause of the Institute was framed as a mission to an unconverted, unclean public, to "teach and spread the doctrine of cleanliness."31 For a brief time, the Cleanliness Institute became a "center of learning: of learning the need for more soap consumption in America." Americans had to learn "not just that they were still soiled, but that they could never be sanitary enough" (Vinikas 1989: 613, 616). This was a campaign on behalf of a commodity cast in the guise of a moral sanitation. 30wEditors Enlist in the Cause of Cleanliness," The Cleanliness Journal 1/2 (1927): 11. 31"Comments of the Press," The Cleanliness Journal 1/1 (1927): 9.</page><page sequence="23">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 23 As scholars have already noted, this was an era when producers learned not only how to make products efficiently, but also how to teach consumers what they needed to do with those products (Marchand 1986). Many ritual theorists have noted the importance of discourses about ritual for their formation and persistence. Within such a frame, the Cleanliness Institute invented an astonishing catechism. From their offices in New York, the Cleanliness Institute distributed incantation after incantation to branch efforts across the country. From the Handbook of Antiseptics (1918) to the Essentials of Healthful Living (1925), from Mouth Hygiene (1927) to Care of the Face (1927), adults were mass-mediated through a pristine print culture. The Book About Baths (1930) offered twenty- four pages of recipes for morning baths, after- work baths, baths to improve looks, baths for children, hot baths, cold baths, and tepid baths. All these baths impressed editorial America. Immediately upon its founding, the Institute received lavish press treatment as a sign of the social conscience possessed by big business. "Soap can be made one of the preservatives and safeguards of our basic social institutions," wrote the Minneapolis Tribune. Through its exonerating agency, soap offered not only sanitation, but explicit sal- vation. "As it is with godliness, so with cleanliness, there are many millions without the desire to repent and be laved. We must continue to 'sell' the world on cleanliness," wrote the Detroit Free Press. Sale and salvation are easy equals for these reporters, knowing as they do that soap is a product of science, offering secular miracles. "Soap has been a potent factor in civilization, no doubt," wrote the San Francisco Bulletin, "It has worked many wonders, including the supplanting of obsolete and corrosive disinfectants such as bichloride of mercury."3 Although cleanliness was an adult duty, children were particular targets. The Cleanliness Institute employed a stable of writers to author children's books and curricular manuals. Through the distribution of stories like Mrs. Fly and Mrs. Mosquito Decide to Leave Cleanville (1920), Pirate Percy and the Slovenly Sloop: A Playlet for Boys (1922), and Green Duck: Why The Children Left No Rubbish in the Park (1927), the Institute embedded messages of clean living into accessible pediatrie portholes. There were Songs of Cleanliness (1926) taught by a Proctor and Gamble hymnal, as well as a fifteen-page instruction guide to Modeling Small Sculptures in White Soap (1926). Swimming with images of whiteness and civilization, such juvenilia was not without its international aspirations.

Hallock, a well-known writer of school health books, offered friendly stories of school time mess- making and cheering bouts of hand- washing. National identity is reified through proclamations of cleanliness, now and then. The story "A Happy Day in Japan," concludes, "Taro and Kiku are proud to belong to a nation which is said to be one of the cleanest in the world." An Italian history lesson focuses on remembrances of baths past: "The teacher told them that in the glorious days of the Roman Empire the people were very clean." And all aspirations of uplift are linked to the ultimate peddler, America: "Yanuk knew that the people in America had sent a great deal of soap to Poland to be used in fighting typhus. But never before had he seen any American soap" (Hallock 1927: 34, 41, 70). All such site-specific fictions were specified in the lessons propagated by the Institute's proposed school reforms. "Is the advancement of cleanliness a conscious goal in your school?" asked the Cleanliness Institute's curriculum. "Do your cleanliness teaching and equipment result in actual essential cleanliness practices?" (Munson 1931: 3). Modern psychology is blended with the best of the Progressive edu- cational philosophies, as the Institute constantly asks that practice is linked with empathy, and empathy connected to genuine conversion. "Morning Inspection Should Be A Time of Happiness," announced the curriculum, "Make it a period of rejoicing over cleanliness rather than searching for dirt." The naturalization of cleanliness is thus processed as a gentle morning ablution, described by the curriculum in three parts: (a) Minimize self-consciousness and make the practice of the daily cleanliness habits matter-of-fact and a natural part of the daily duties. (b) Suggest any action necessary as a matter of course, never as a punishment. (c) Smile in approval at those who are clean and in understanding of those who are not (Munson 6). With cleanliness a "matter of course" littered with condescension and smiles, the goal of the curriculum is attitudinal. "Likes to have face clean at all times," hopes the Cleanliness Institute for its junior sub- jects, "Enjoys a warm soapy bath. Likes to know that those parts of the body which perspire freely, are involved in discharge of body wastes, and subject to body odors, are clean each day. Likes the feeling of clean, well-groomed feet. Enjoys the feeling of being clean." Enjoyment and liking take precedence over hygienic necessity. This is not a medical intervention (although medical prescriptions abound in</page><page sequence="25">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 25 the Institute's library) but an experiential one. Educated children will know "WHY one should leave the washbowl clean and neat for the next person . . . WHY used towels should be placed in the waste paper basket." These lessons are not the product of bland liturgy but parable. "Children of this age are much interested in their pets and in how animal friends practice habits of cleanliness," explains the curriculum, "Keep notebooks as to the habits of different animals." Presumed throughout the curriculum is the contrast between cleanliness and slovenliness, education and ignorance, civilization and savagery. "How do the habits of animals in captivity differ from those in the wild state?" asks one curricular lesson, "Visit a zoo and have the keeper tell about the animals." The comparison is not pre- sumed: "Compare changes of habits in captivity with changes in habits of men when living in closer contact with each other" (Munson 1931: 8, 14, 15). Clean captivity is preferred. Students should leave the zoo and know that their homes- their tenements, apartments, and houses- are safe haven so long as they bracketed themselves in an aura of clean. As seems to be inevitable in American modernity, the divide between primitive subjects and the civilized citizen is carefully demar- cated, yet traversable through certain practices. New habits made modern men. But these were not unfamiliar habits. "The purificatory ablutions which the Greeks and Romans performed at intervals by way of preparation for communion with their gods is proposed as a part of the daily program of life," writes one journalist for The Cleanliness Journal, "The hygienic laws of the Pentateuch . . . gave cleanliness of hands as a figure of speech for those who were innocent of evil and pure in heart" (Finley 1927: 7). Religious rituals of hand washing and bodily purification are persistently invoked and praised, from the baths of Rome to mikvahs of Jews to the regulatory cleansings of Babylonians, Assyrians, Hindus, and Muslims (Spicer 1930a: 14-15). Anxieties about cleanliness are the product of primitive irrationality, not rational faith. "Taboos against the practice of cleanliness . . . usually result from unreasoning superstition, time-worn custom, and age-old tradition. They are often but the twisted and grotesque health concepts of simple-minded peasant races," wrote one Cleanliness Journal contri- butor (Spicer 1930b: 3/4: 9-10). Indeed, the strongest language of con- demnation is saved not for the indigenous or the immigrant, but the problematic priest and his archaic church. "The influence of the early Christians on later Christendom was tremendous," wrote Hallock in A Tale of Soap and Water: The Historical Progress of Cleanliness (1928), "Their attitude toward cleanliness colored the thoughts of a thousand</page><page sequence="26">26 Journal of the American Academy of Religion years." Hallock elaborates this profile of the early church and its sub- sequent proponents: The priests did not encourage bathing. Indeed their teaching that the body is to be despised actually discouraged it To the early Christians the luxury of baths of Rome was connected with the moral and spiritual decay of the people. When gradually the Christians came to power there was a reaction from the Roman baths. The cleanliness of the body fell out of favor and the cult of uncleanliness began. (1928: 43, 44, 49) In this historical arc, the early church and its priestly purveyors infected man with a hatred of the body, endorsing a theological favor for filth. The anti-Catholicism of such a narration mirrors the overarching Protestant modernity sanctioned by popular and pedagogical literatures of the period. For example, in Modern Educators and Their Ideals (1909), Tadasu Misawa points to the progressive aftereffects of Protestantism's triumph: "The Reformation really marks the beginning of modern edu- cation in the West . . . [The Reformation] awakened a sense of the worth of the individual; the longing for the perfection of personality in its all- sidedness, intellectual, moral, and physical, was aroused" (Misawa 1909: 7, 11). The "gospel of cleanliness" was the good news of a body-loving, soul-salving Christianity, one at odds with the self-loathing squalor of Rome's church (Hallock 1928: 81). The modern life endorsed by the Cleanliness Institute is the antiseptic individual experience, with unseen hands removing the hangnails of human production from the visual landscape, lighting a cleansed and widened way for us to toil. In this, the Cleanliness Institute maps neatly into a longer history of ministries within church organizations goading the salvation through the regulation of the physical self. It is no surprise that bodies were so culturally consti- tuted. As Marie Griffith (2004) has demonstrated, the relationship between Christianity and physical perfection is a persistent and diversely expressed one. But it is a surprise to find that industry's complicity in such a construction was explicit, not implicit.33 The cleansing of the body was not metaphorical proposition. It was a literal baptism. "Cleanliness is something bigger than a cake of soap and a tub of water," explained Dr. W. W. Peter in a 1927 issue of The Cleanliness Journal (Donnelly 1927: 11). This "something bigger" is, of course, a version of moral superiority recognizable to historians of this period, 33For more on the Christian construction of the body, see Brown (1988), Bynum (1995), Hoverd and Sibley (2007), and Tripp (2000).</page><page sequence="27">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 27 when whiteness, civilization, and Protestant moral fervor hit a fever pitch in the iconography of facial products and modern loveliness (Cogdell 2004). "Cleanliness!," exclaimed another editorial, "There is a crispness, a fragrance to that word which stirs the imagination almost magically. In cleanliness there is beauty and growth, an imma- culateness which seems divine" (Brainerd 1927: 11). The Cleanliness Institute's primary task was to train Americans in new cleansing rituals, to ensure that they not only knew about soap, but that they needed to use soap (in a prescribed ritual manner) in order to be good, godly Americans. "Cleanliness is our guardian angel in the material world," explained Dr. Alice G. Bryant of Gorgas Memorial Institute (Bryant 1927: 12). "We should put those who promote cleanliness on earth next to those who try to promote its godliness," finalized another (Finley 1927: 7). In Grace T. Hallock's A Tale of Soap and Water, talk of godliness is coupled with an explicit description of bathing, and cleanliness as ritual: "We have seen that at the very beginning a bath was probably an accident. Further on, a bath became an incident, looked upon as una- voidable in the business of fishing or of crossing streams. Last of all a bath became a frequent event. It acquired importance in itself as a means of cleanliness and comfort" (1928: 92). Creating new forms was the hallmark of the advertising era, as Earnest Elmo Calkins and Ralph Holden wrote in their 1905 treatise, Modern Advertising, "Advertising modifies the course of a people's daily thoughts, gives them new words and phrases, new ideas, new fashions, new prejudices, and new customs. In the same way it obliterates old sets of words and phrases, fashions and customs" (1905: 7). Calkins and Holden summarize a process that has become so commonplace, so predictable, so plain, that it seems redundant to name it. Soap was not soap without more pro- ducts: washstands and towels, basins and ewers, flesh brushes and tubs, plumbing systems and scents. Products begat products. This is how taking a bath and buying a soap became rituals of modernity, rituals inlaid with certitude about the moral job of cleanliness and the correct- ness of consumer rites. This was, of course, part of a broader pattern of theological therapy: "Therapies became more theological, theologies more therapeutic" (Lears 1994: 178). Scholarship has offered useful surveys of the rise of therapeutic discourses and liberal theology in the emergence of the twentieth century. However, it has not yet accounted for the complicity of industrial agents in the formation of these ideol- ogies of practice. As Mary Douglas noted in her reflections on purity and danger, "... when we honestly reflect on our busy scrubbings and cleanings in this light we know we are not mainly trying to avoid</page><page sequence="28">28 Journal of the American Academy of Religion disease" (1984: 69). The evasion of disease was a happy side effect of a protective prescription. After all, the greatest fear of manufacturers was not that the population would die of typhus, but that they would do so having never bought the product. With soap, and soap's ritual prescrip- tions, and soap's Protestant promises, the consumer entered the ritual discourse of industrial religion. CONCLUSION Industrial religion and its allegories of progress persist despite all arguments or examples to the contrary. Today one might find individ- ual industrial sites employing industrial chaplains, a vocation endorsed by Heaton and expanding exponentially in the twentieth century.34 Likewise, the sale of soap products has surpassed mere chat of hygiene and exploded as homeopathic discourse sells facial soaps to traverse physical beauty, seductive possibility, and soulful self-service (Scranton 2000; Black 2004). Discourses on cleanliness and enlightened pro- duction practices coalesce in talk about "clean coal," even as Christian organizations promote economic development in Appalachia and else- where using the language of sanitation, work ethic, and progress. The post-industrial age trades on industrial religion's terrain, strategically employing allegories of progress through transformative technologies and the wonders of commodities. Here is the trajectory of a modern history of religion that refuses to pit the materialism of industrialism against the spiritualism or moralism of religion, but rather finds the two intertwined, mutually constituting an orientation to modern life that promotes industrial technologies and habits as rightly religious. When Washington Gladden declared that "the steam-engine, the spinning-jenny, the power-loom, the power-press, the sewing machine, all these mechanical devices by which labor is saved and production increased, are provided for in God's design," he was not only sanctifying industrial technologies as God's tools by way of a longstanding American Protestant practice of locating the present on a map of Providence. He was also taking part in the production of a new millen- nial imagination. "They are part of his great work of development," Gladden continued, "by which he is carrying the race forward to its perfect destiny" (Gladden 1876: 14-15). In this, industrial religion was 34For contemporary examples, see the Corporate Chaplains of America in Raleigh, NC, a non- profit organization founded in 1996 (http://www.iamchap.org).

Flynn (2004).</page><page sequence="29">Callahan et al: Allegories of Progress 29 contiguous, but not synonymous, with postmillennial Protestant faith in progress (Moorhead 1999). Industrial religion tapped those postmillen- nial energies, which themselves were stimulated by the speed of indus- trial developments, and mixed them with the imagination unleashed by the potentialities of new technologies and their ability to change the world, society, and the self. Thus a nuanced and contextualized element of what David F. Noble has called "the religion of technology" has a place in the story of industrial religion (1997). Likewise, ongoing explorations of the cultural and religious meanings of American tech- nologies, such as those conducted by historian David Nye, might further complicate the sources and developments of industrial religion (Nye 1996, 2004). Examples abound of apocalyptic, millenarian, and Utopian expressions of industrial promise, from Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward to the visions of a proletariat paradise envisioned by the Industrial Workers of the World, continuing even through the Whole Earth Catalog's offer of "access to tools" because "we are as gods so we might as well get good at it" to today's Age of Spiritual Machines and "Apocalyptic AI" (Bellamy 1889; Brand 1969; Kurzweil 1999; Geraci 2008). However, we are reminded by recent reportage of such things as col- lapsing mines and dead miners, for example, that industrial religion is not mere corporate window-dressing. Its discursive practices are part of the material production of an American self, disciplined to labor, and to consume industry as second nature. Yet the rhetoric of producers has only unevenly corresponded to the ritual practices of consumers and workers, Progress and modernity have had a somewhat different valence depending upon where one has stood in the circulation of com- merce (Lasch 1991). As embodied in the concrete realities of industrial labor, progress has appeared to be full of contradictions. If industrialists and missionaries in the central Appalachian mountains saw in coal a symbol and power of transformation, modernity, and progress, coal miners themselves have spoken of a no-less material, no-less symbolic, and no-less powerful presence of coal in their experiences of industrial development. Their lives, their bodies, their houses, and their work were constantly covered with the black dust of coal. They breathed it, and they talked about it "getting in their blood."35 In a striking contrast to the spectacular, clean, bodiless-and-senseless portrayal of coal-as- 35Collections of oral history interviews, such as those collected in the Appalachian Oral History Project (housed mainly at Alice Lloyd College in Pippa Passes, Kentucky) or the University of Kentucky's Social History and Cultural Change in the Elkhorn Coal Field Oral History Project are incredible sources of miner's own perceptions of industrial development.</page><page sequence="30">30 Journal of the American Academy of Religion fetish presented by industrialists, miners experienced coal as a physical reality that directly impacted their bodies and their daily lives in both direct and ambiguous ways. The progress promoted by industrial reli- gion did not always live up to its promise. Nevertheless, industry was here to stay, and religion was here to stay, and Americans produced their various modernities through ritual practices and practical imagin- ation in relation to material realities. When twelve miners perished in a coal mine in Sago, WV, in January 2006, America watched as mining families gathered at the Sago Baptist Church, taking part in another ritual engagement with industrial religion's ambivalent powers. Indeed, we should consider both the prayers of the community of miners and the anxious televi- sion viewing of the wider population as ritualized practices of modern industrial America, together with the moralizing discourses on power and responsibility that followed in the media, in the courts, and in churches. Religion did not disappear in the industrial setting, but neither could it exist in splendid isolation from the materialities of industrial production. New meanings of human labor and value were forged in allegories of progress and sacrifice that "naturalized" indus- trial life even in the midst of critique. As the allegories explored in this article explain, the identification of industrial religion as a cat- egory only begins to appraise its moral imperatives. Examining indus- trial religion as a form of religious creativity inaugurates, we hope, a conversation not only among cultural historians of religion, but also among practitioners, theologians, and theorists as to its ongoing consequences.
