<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ulrich Beck On the Way toward an Industrial Society of Risk? An Outline of an Argument I. The new paradigm of a society of risk The term that describes our situation socially and sociologically most succinctly and most incisively is the term "post." Everything is "post" We became accustomed some time ago already to the condition of post-industrialism: the concept still says something to us. But since then post-materialism, post-feminism, and post-modernism have come into currency, and as for post-late-capitalism, it is perhaps better for the time being to pass over it in silence. "Post" is the expression of a sociological quandary. It is the blind man's staff of the social sciences. Its message is as troubled and as irritating as it is empty: there is something that is "after"?what this is and how it looks, we do not know. "Post" is also the word forlaziness in sociological thinking. The strings of our thought in social theory and social history have snapped. We have accommo dated ourselves to theories of advanced industrial society or late capitalism, convinced ourselves of the end of history?post-history? and therefore for all the sheer innovations expect no further real innovations. Everything has already been. So let us continue as before. German text ? 1986 by Ulrich Beck. "Auf den Weg in die industrielle Risiko gesellschaft? Eine Argumentationsskizze." In W. Sch?mm (ed.), Strukturwandel in der Industriegesellschaft, Frankfurt/Main, NY, 1986. This talk borrows on a few reflections in my books Risikogesellschaft?Auf dem Weg in eine anderer Moderne, Frankfurt, 1986 (English translation forth coming from Sage), and Gegengifte?Die organisierte Unverantwortlichkeit, Frankfurt/Main, 1988 (English translation forthcoming from Polity Press). The theses summed up here refer to only one particular aspect, are necessarily abridged, and cannot replace a reading of the overall argument in the books. 51</page><page sequence="2">52 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY Never has sociology sat so well in the saddle institutionally as now. Never has it been so unimaginative, so unstimulating, in grasping social reality, as it is carried along in the historical flux as today. Th ere are systematic reasons for this, but I will not go into them here. Instead I should like to do something, or at least attempt to do something, that will seem both to you and to me to be basically impossible: namely, to take up the strands of social theory again, and give the word " post" some content. My central thesis is as follows. In the advanced modern world, the social production of wealth systematically goes hand in hand with the social production of risks. Accordingly, the problems and conflicts of distribution in a society of shortages are overlayered by problems and conflicts that arise from the production, definition, and distribution of scientifi cally and technologically produced risks. This change from the distribution of wealth to the distribution of risks is linked historically to (at least) two conditions. It occurs?as is now apparent?in those circumstances where (and to the same degree that) genuine material need can be objectively reduced or at least socially contained by virtue of the attained level of human and technological forces of production and the guarantees and controls provided by constitutional law and the welfare state. Second, this categorical change is also dependent on the fact that risks and the potential of self-threat have been unleashed on a hitherto unprecedented scale as a consequence of the exponential growth in the forces of production as the process of moderniz ation continues (e.g., pollutants and toxins in foods, air, and water, al omic weapons and nuclear energy, human genetics). As these conditions establish themselves, one historical type of thinking and acting is relativized or overlayered by another. The term "industrial or class society" (in the broadest sense cf Marx and Weber) centers on the question of how socially produced wealth can be distributed socially unequally and nonetheless "le gitimately." This overlaps with the new paradigm of a society of risk, which at bottom rests on the resolution of a similar yet quite different problem. How can the risks and hazards that are system atically produced as part of the advanced process of modermzation be prevented, rendered innocuous, dramatized, channeled, and in those cases where they have actually materialized in the form of latent side effects, be so contained and dispersed to the winds that they neither hinder the process of modernization nor overstep the</page><page sequence="3">SPRING 1990 53 limits of what may be reasonably accepted (ecologically, medi cally, psychologically, socially). We live in a transitional period, a period marked by the overlapping of the distribution of wealth and the distribution of risks. The dynamics of conflict and the state of problems in the advanced modem world can no longer be under stood in the categories of distribution of wealth alone, and are not yet understood in the categories of distribution of risk. This logic of risk definition and distribution can be developed (as an ideal type) with respect to: ?the labor market and the system of production (microelectron ics, flexible work time, forms of underemployment, and decentral ized gainful work); ?the release from traditional and institutional forms of control ling anxiety and insecurity in the family, marriage, sexual roles, and class consciousness; ?the demystification of scientific rationality (the demystifica tion of the demystifier), technological risk, the critique of progress, and finally (a topic we shall be exclusively concerned with here): ?the risks and consequences of modernization, reflected in an irreversible endangerment of the life of plants, animals, and human beings. These can no longer be confined to specific locations and specific groups as were the industrial and occupational risks in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century. Rather, they contain a tendency toward globalization, which extends into the spheres of production and reproduction and ignores the boundaries of nation states, and in this sense gives rise to transnational, non-class-spe cific situations of global endangerment. II. The risks of modernization?five theses In the following I should like to take up only the last point and illuminate in five theses a few essential aspects of the social architec ture and political dynamics of the potential for self-endangerment in the civilized world. 1. Modernization unleashed risks in the most advanced stage of the development of the productive forces, by which I mean first and foremost radioactivity, but also pollutants and poisons in the air, water, and foods, and the attendant short-term and long-term con</page><page sequence="4">54 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY sequences for animals, plants, and humans. These risks totally elude direct human perception and differ in an essential way from wealth. They cause systemic, often irreversible damage, and at bottom usually remain invisible. They are ensconced in causal interpreta tions, and are thus first and exclusively produced in the (scientific or anti-scientific) knowledge about them. These risks can be changed, diminished, or expanded, dramatized or rendered harmless through knowledge, and to that extent they are especially pen to processes of social definition. Thus the media and the professions engaged in defining risk (e.g., medical technicians, environmental organizations) become key positions in society and politics. 2. Situations of social endangerment arise with the distrilDution and the accumulation of risks. Although these reproduce the in equality of stratum and class positions in some dimensions cf risk, they follow essentially a different logic of distribution. The risks attendant on modernization sooner or later catch up with those who produce them or profit from them as well. They contain a boomer ang effect that bursts asunder the class schema. Even the rich and the powerful are not safe from them, not only as health hazards, but also insofar as they endanger legitimation, possessions, and profits. Ecological debasement and expropriations ensue from the social recognition of the risks of modernization and stand in manifold and systematic contradiction to the profit and property interests that drive the process of industrialization forward. At the same time, risks produce new international inequalities, namely, between the Third World and the industrial nations, and among the industrial nations. They undermine the structure of authority of the national state. And, given the universality and transnationality of commerce in pollutants, the life of a blade of grass in the Bavarian forest is ultimately dependent on the conclu sion and observance of international agreements. 3. Yet the spread and marketing of risks by no means breaks with the logic of industrial development, but rather raises it to a new level. The risks of modernization are big business. They zire the interminable needs sought by economists. Hunger can be stilled, needs can be satisfied. The risks attendant on civilization are a bottomless vessel of needs, interminable, endless, which produce themselves. One could say with Luhmann that risks mate the economy self-referring, independent of the environment of human need satisfactions. But this means that industrial society produces,</page><page sequence="5">SPRING 1990 55 with the economic cannibalization of the risks it unleashes, the risk situations and the political potential of a risk society. 4. One can possess wealth, but one is affected by risks; they are assigned, as it were, by civilization. To stretch a point, one could say schematically that in class and stratum situations existence determines consciousness, while in risk situations consciousness determines being. Knowledge acquires a new political signifi cance. Accordingly, the political potential in a society of risk must be developed and analyzed in a sociology and a theory of the genesis and spread of knowledge about risks. 5. Socially recognized risks, as became clearly apparent for the first time in the example of the debates on the dying forests, contain a peculiar, politically explosive material. What had hitherto been regarded as unpolitical becomes political, namely, the elimination of causes in the process of modernization and industrialization itself. Suddenly, the public and politics are having their say in the intimate sphere of firm management, in product planning, in tech nical equipment, etc. It thus becomes remarkably clear what the battle over the definition of risks is actually all about?not only the future health problems for nature and for human beings, but also the social, economic, and political side effects of these side effects: market downturns, the devalorization of capital, bureaucratic con trol of firm decisions, the opening up of new markets, colossal costs, law suits, and loss of face. Thus in the society of risk, the political potential of disasters is brought to bear in large and small, e.g., in smog alarms, in poison disasters, in the endangerment of foods, etc. Protection against them and handling them can involve a reorganization of power and authority. Thus the society of risk is also a catastrophe society. In it, a state of emergency threatens to become a normal state. III. First thesis: the dependence of risks on knowledge Risks, like goods, are objects of distribution and both create situations, risk or class situations. But the goods are different in the two cases, and their distribution is also disputed differently. In the case of social riches, these are consumer goods, income, educational opportunities, possessions, etc., all things in short supply that are worth striving for. In contrast, risks are a byproduct of modernization, and occur in a surfeit worth preventing. They must be either eliminated or dis</page><page sequence="6">56 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY avowed, i.e., reinterpreted. The positive logic of appropriation is thus counterposed to a negative logic of dispersing, avoidance, disavowal, and reinterpretation. While income, education, and the like, are goods for the individ ual that can be consumed and experienced, risks remain l argely invisible and their existence is conveyed basically through argu ment. What impairs health and destroys nature is often noi: percep tible to one's own senses and eyes. Even where it seems to be obvious it must be socially construed after it has been "objectively" determined by an authoritative expert judgment. Many of "the new risks (nuclear or chemical pollution, pollutants in foods, the dis eases of civilization) totally elude direct human perception. More and more, risks that are often neither visible nor perceptible to the persons affected are moving into the forefront: these are risks that under certain conditions do not themselves become effective dur ing the lifetime of the persons concerned, but first affect their progeny. In any case, these are risks that require the perceptual organs of science (i.e., theory, experiments, measuring instru ments) to become at all visible and accessible to interpretation as risks. The paradigm of these risks are the gene-mutating conse quences of radioactivity, which are imperceptible to the persons concerned, who (as the reactor accident at Harrisburg showed) are totally at the mercy of the judgment, the mistakes, and the contro versies of experts, and are subject to tremendous nervous stress. The threat potential contained in the factors determining class situation (e.g., loss of job) is evident to every person concerned. No special instruments of knowledge are necessary for this?no measuring procedures, no statistical surveys, no reflections on validity, no considerations of tolerance thresholds. That a person is affected is evident and in this respect independent of being lenown. A person who finds out that his daily tea contains DDT ;ind the rolls he just bought contain formaldehyde is in a quite different situation. He cannot decide whether he is affected using his own tools of knowledge or means of discovery. Whether DDT is in his tea or formaldehyde in his rolls, and in what concentrations, is just as elusive to the intervention of his knowledge as is the question of whether or not?and if so in what concentrations?these sub stances will over the long or short term have a harmful ef fect on the kidneys, heart, chromosomes, etc. It is decided with autside knowledge and through outside knowledge what type of threat this</page><page sequence="7">SPRING 1990 57 is (headaches, ulcers, cancer), when it occurs and in whom, with what probability, etc. Thus, all questions that center on the degree of risk involvement in a situation are decided through outside knowledge. In this way, risk situations create a social dependence on knowledge that is alien to class situations. On the one hand, the persons concerned have no competence to judge matters concerning their own involvement. They lose an essential bit of the sovereignty of knowledge. What threatens them at the same time makes them dependent on the outside knowledge of other people, and hence on the norms, interests, and mistakes latent in that knowledge. Accordingly, in risk situations, the things of daily life can be transformed overnight into Trojan horses out of which the risk experts come storming and (though disputing among themselves) proclaim what one need fear and what one need not fear. Risk situations can be presumptively imputed to all things of daily life. And there they remain, invisible, yet all too present, calling for the experts to give answers to the questions they loudly pose. In this sense, risk situations are springs pouring forth ques tions to which those affected have no answers. On the other hand, this also means that all decisions taking place within the framework of the production of knowledge about risks and the hazards of civilization are never solely decisions concern ing the particulars of knowledge (questions, hypotheses, measuring procedures, methods, limiting values, etc.). They are also at the same time decisions about the state of being affected?about the scope and the type of risk, the substance of the threat, the group of persons affected, the long-term consequences, measures to be taken, persons responsible, and claims for compensation. If it should be suddenly detenriined that formaldehyde or DDT were definitely harmful to health in the concentrations in which these chemical substances occur in items of everyday use and in foods, the detennination would be equivalent to a disaster, since they have by now become ubiquitous. But the fact that this connection between decisions within knowledge and decisions concerning the state of being affected, makes clear that the latitudes within which scientific research is free to maneuver are becoming ever narrower as the threat potential of the forces of production grows. To ac knowledge suddenly that a mistake had been made in establishing the limiting concentrations for the tolerance of pesticides (which basically is the normal case in science) would be tantamount to</page><page sequence="8">58 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY triggering a catastrophe, and for this reason alone would have to be hushed up. Thus it becomes clear that the destructive forces scien tists must deal with today in many topical areas impose upon them the inhuman law of infallibility, a law that is not only most human to break, but which also stands in clear contradiction to the scien tific ideals of progress and criticism. IV. Second thesis: the risks attendant on modernization burst asunder the class schema Reduced to one succinct phrase: need is hierarchical, smog is demo cratic. Social differences and social boundaries are made relative as the risks attendant on modernization (i.e., the endangerment of nature, health, nutrition, etc.) spread. There may still be paths of escape away from air pollution and traffic noise into privileged living; but our lakes, seas, and waterways will soon be polluted everywhere, and ciU will be equal before more than just the threat of nuclear explosions. Very different consequences are still drawn from this. But risks obje ctively have an equalizing effect in respect to the range and degree of people's exposure. This in fact is what gives them their novel political force. In this sense, risk societies are not class societies; their risk situations cannot be understood as class situations, nor their conflicts as class conflicts. The boomerang effect and ecological devalorization This trend toward globalization takes initially the form of a boomerang effect: the rich and the powerful are not safe from the consequences of modernization either. This boomerang effect in no way need be manifested as a direct threat to life; it may also be rellected in derivative forms?in money, possessions, market downturns, and loss of confidence. Thus the dying forests are not only causing entire bird species to disappear permanently, they also reduce the economic value of forest and land holdings. Here, as in many other cases, the principle is the same: possessions are devalorized, ecologically expropriated in subtle forms. News on toxins in foods and commodities, the threat of accidents involving chemical toxins or reactors, and all the more so rliose that have actually occurred, effectuate a creeping or galloping debase ment of property rights. A dying earth policy is being steadily pursued, sometimes erupting even in sudden disaster, in the un</page><page sequence="9">SPRING 1990 59 checked production of the risks of modernization. The highly indus trialized system produces a kind of no-man's-land socialism of biological horrors. If something is contaminated or is regarded as contaminated (the difference becomes almost insignificant as far the decline of social and economic value is concerned), it makes no difference to whom that thing belongs or who would like to have it. Though the legal title of property may be retained, it becomes both useless and worthless. Thus, this ecological expropriation, system atically produced in the risks attendant on modernization, is a kind of social and economic expropriation, though legal continuity of property is retained. This applies to foods and objects of daily use, as well as to the air, land, and water. And so a genuine contradiction that is growing systematically worse arises between the interests of profit and property that serve as the progressive driving force behind the industrialization process, and its manifold threatening conse quences that also endanger and expropriate possessions and profits. New social inequalities on a world scale The "proletariat" of the world society of risk live beneath the chimneys and alongside the refineries and chemical plants in the industrial centers of the third world. The poison gas accident in Bhopal, India, brought this to the awareness of the world public?risk industries have been resettled in countries with cheap labor. This is no accident. There exists a systematic force of attraction between extreme poverty and extreme risk. Toxins and pollutants waft, stream, and seep where they wish. The universality of industrial production is counterbalanced by a transnationality of commerce in hazardous chemicals. The indus trial countries must henceforth differentiate themselves according to their national records on emission and immission. International inequalities are being created among the different industrial coun tries with positive, even, and negative hazardous chemical balance sheets or, put more bluntly, between countries that dump filth and those that bathe and breathe in the filth of the others and must pay for this with the deaths of plants, animals, and human beings. The society of risk (in contrast to the earlier industrial society) shows a tendency for the state and conditions of being affected to become objectively uniform in global risk situations as the risks of modernization grow more acute, and eliminate those areas that have not yet been affected. In the limiting case, friend and enemy,</page><page sequence="10">60 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY East and West, above and below, city and countryside, blac k and white, South and North, are exposed to the equalizing pressure of the self-potentiating risks of civilization. Societies of risk are not class societies?and that is an understatement. They contain a developmental dynamic that bursts asunder all boundaries, driving humanity together in a uniform situation of the self-imposed risks of civilization. Thus the potential for self-imposed hazards of civilization that has developed in the process of modernization makes the utopia of a world society a bit more real, or at least more urgent. Just as people in the nineteenth century had to learn to submit to the conditions of industrial society and wage labor on penalty of economic de cline, people today and in the future will likewise have to learn to live under the scourge of a civilized apocalypse, to sit down together at the same table, and to find and implement solutions going beyond all boundaries to the hazards for which they them selves are to blame. But attempts such as these to derive a political meaning from terrors that defy comprehension must not create the illusion that these newly emergent risks, shared in common by all, have been floating in apolitical and organizational vacuum. On the contrary, they collide with the egoisms of national states, and with the prevailing parties and interest groups internal to industrial socie ties. There is no place in the jungle of corporate society for global risk situations that cut across groups and organizations. Every organization has its clientele and its social environment cons isting of contracting parties and allies who must be activated and played off against one another. The counterpart in the society of risk to the political subject of class society, the proletariat, is the gross fact that all are af fected by rather tangible mammoth hazards. One can always eas ily keep aloof of such things or suppress them. Everyone and no one is responsible for them, and that means every individual, with only one leg to stand on at that. With the other leg, he has to fight for his job (his income, his family, his little house, his automobile fetishes, and his holiday dreams). Solidarity out of anxiety? The quality of community begins to change where class society and risk society overlap. Put schematically, totally different value systems</page><page sequence="11">SPRING 1990 61 apply in these two types of modem societies. Industrial class societies remain committed in their developmental dynamic to the counter-ideal of equality (in its various formulations such as equality of opportunity to the variants of socialist societies). This is not so for the risk society. Its normative counter-model, which serves as its basis and driving force, is security. The value system of an unequal society is replaced by the value system of an insecure society. Accordingly, there is also a difference with respect to basic social situations in which people exist, form associations, are motivated, are divided, or forge mutual bonds. The driving force in class society can be summed up in one phrase: I am hungry! Conversely, the movement set off by the society of risk may be expressed in the statement: I am afraid! A community of need is replaced by a community of anxiety. In this respect, the risk society typifies a social epoch in which solidarity emerges out of anxiety and be comes a political force. But it is still quite unclear how the binding force of anxiety works. How far can anxiety be pushed? How does the new solidarity community of the anxious behave? Anxiety has never been a basis of rational action. Perhaps this exception no longer applies? V. Third thesis: the marketability of risks There are systematic reasons why the consciousness of the risks of civilization has become much keener in recent years. Risks are becom ing more and more amenable to definition by science, and (the one conditions the other) risks are a growing business. It is far from being the case that pointing out the hazards attending the development of civilization is solely a critique whose net effect is to throw sand into the works of the system. It is also a prime factor of economic boom, despite all the verbal resistance and acrobatics of dismay. This be comes more than clear in the growth of the pertinent branches and sectors of the economy, as well as in growing public expenditures for environmental protection, combating the diseases of civilization, etc. The industrial system profits from the nuisances it produces, and not so poorly at that. An argument from the systemic perspective will demonstrate the same thing. Risks are the driving force of economic boom because they are the interminable needs sought by economists. Through the production of risks, needs are definitely extricated from whatever</page><page sequence="12">62 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY mooring they still had left in nature and hence from their f initude and requitability. Quite new needs?and hence new markets?can be created by changing the definition of risks; needs that are open to interpretation can be causally constituted and proliferated end lessly. Thus production and consumption are raised to a new stage as the risk society becomes entrenched. The self-proliferating risk replaces needs that are predefined and open to manipulation as a point of reference for commodity production by self-prolif erating risk. To venture a somewhat bold comparison, one could say that developed capitalism has absorbed, generalized, and normalized the destructive force of war into its production of risks. Just as in wars, the risks of civilization becoming conscious can destroy the stockpiles of overproduced goods and entire hitherto functioning modes of production (for example, exhaust-intensive automobiles), i.e., overcome crises in turnover and sales, and create new markets. The production of risks, and the accompanying production of knowledge?critique of civilization, critique of technology, cri tique of ecology, the dramaturgy of risks in the mass media, risk research?are all system-immanent normal forms for revolution izing needs, and transforming saturated markets into new and openly expanded markets. Essential to this, however, is a symp tomatic and symbolic mastering of risks. Risks must, so to speak, grow as they are brought under control. They must not actually be eliminated by getting to their origins and causes. Everything must take place within the framework of risk cosmetics?packaging, symptomatic reductions in pollutants, and installation of purifying filters?while the source of the filth is retained. Thus there is not a preventive, but only a symbolic, politics and industry to eliminate proliferating risks. VI. Fourth thesis: consciousness determines being, knowledge of risks, the state of being affected by risks It is often assumed that the sciences have a monopoly on knowledge in dealing with risks. I believe that this falls wide of the actual pro?Dlem, because in fact the natural sciences began their road to Canossa when they began to get involved with technical risks. Risks cut across the established theoretical distinctions and institutional jurisdicdons. They also cut across the distinction between theory and practice, the</page><page sequence="13">SPRING 1990 63 boundaries of specialized areas and disciplines, specialized compe tences and institutional authorities, the distinction between value and fact (and hence between ethics, the human sciences and the natural sciences), and finally they cut across the seemingly institutionally segregated domains of politics, the public, science, and economics. The modem world found itself constrained to "dedifferentiate" in bringing the risks of civilization under control. The usual distinction between "objective" risks that are discov ered and determined by science and the relatively irrational percep tion of risk by the public is based on a categorical error. This distinction misunderstands the role of the technical sciences. Ev erywhere, scientific risk research lags behind the social and envi ronmental progress and cultural critique of the industrial system. In this sense, there is a good bit of unacknowledged culture-critical conversion in the scientific and technical concern with the risks of civilization. The natural sciences and technical sciences have con verted to another faith, but with the key difference that many of the insignias of their power to define are still valid and still assert themselves in the other camp as well. The aspiration of the technical sciences to a monopoly on rationality in the perception of risks is tantamount to a pope claiming infallibility who has converted to the evangelical faith. Thus becoming aware of risks can only be reconstrued as a conflict between competing, in part opposing, in part overlapping claims to rationality. The question that must be asked on the example of risk perception is how rationality emerges socially, i.e., how is it believed, how does it become questionable, how is it defined, how is it redefined, how is it acquired, and how is it squandered. We shall now attempt to sketch some of the traits of the (un)logic as well as the clashing and intermingling of the different ways that risks of civilization are perceived and assessed by science and society. The critique of scientific risk research The door to social recognition of the risks attendant on modernization is still blocked by a wrong diagnosis, which by now has become scientifically entrenched. At the beginning stands the collective pro fessional mistake that the woes of modernization have themselves to blame. The place that disease or havoc occurs is regarded as defining the limits within which its cause is to be sought as well. The conse</page><page sequence="14">64 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY quence is that the effects of modernization are systematically falsified with professional indulgence into individual and local problems and placed at the doorstep of those affected by them. The cornection between the cause of the risks of modernization and their effects is severed, and the effects are transformed into the causes of themselves. This is not something exceptional and coincidental; rather it takes place regularly and systematically. The blindness to risks that sets in and has now become a structure has its names. These are over specialization within the division of labor, and orientation toward productivity. Productivity-enhancing production of wealth has: always disregarded the risks that are produced together with it. Scientists insist on the benignity of their work, both for reasons of professional ethics, and for career reasons. But then something peculiar occurs in the field of risk research: the sphere of recog nized risk is minimized as the standards of scientificity aret driven higher and higher. This implicitly gives a scientific carte blanche for the potentiation of risks. To stretch the point: the insistence on the purity of scientific analysis leads to a pollution and coni:anina tion of the air, food water, and land, plants, animals, and human beings. Thus there is a secret coalition between strict scientificity and the life risk situations thereby permitted or encouraged. Scien tific risk management proceeds in accordance with this peculiar principle: in case of doubt, the toxin must be protected from the endangering intervention of man. This relation may be demonstrated on the basis of the controlla ble "goodness lever" of the proof of causality: the higher the criteria of goodness of a proof of causality (which in any event must systematically never be conducted along the lines of strici: c ause and-effect relations in the case of the risks of modernization), the narrower is the sphere of recognized risks and the greater the backup of unrecognized risks. Thus an insistence on benignity is a highly effective and most easily legitimated dam construction for blocking off and channeling the flood of modernization risks. But in an international comparison, the Federal Republic of Germany is all alone at the top. In Japan, for instance, the strictly caus al proof was long ago replaced by a proof of correlation in the face of system-related transnational modernization risks, although this did not come about without prolonged social conflicts. In the Federal Republic, the dismissal on the basis of a strict causality argument of the injuries and suffering experienced by</page><page sequence="15">SPRING 1990 65 those affected can only seem to them to be a crass mockery. They drive themselves to utter frustration out of the impossibility of demonstrating the required causal relationship. The smog that makes their children cough themselves blue at night may be ex plained away, but the smog itself remains. The (dis)array of permissible limits Threshold values for permissible trace quantities of pollutants and toxins in the air, water, and food have in relation to risk distribution a function comparable to that of the performance principle with regard to the unequal distribution of wealth. They both permit the production of toxins and legitimate it in just that restricted range. Limiting pollution is tantamount to accepting it. Formerly, values, even threshold values, were a matter for ethics, not chemistry. And so the "Regulations for the Highest Permissible Quantities of Plant Pesticides and other Agents as well as other Types of Pesticides in or on Foods and Tobacco Products" is an example of the biological leftover ethics of a developed industrial civilization. But this ethic remains peculiarly negative. It validates the principle, formerly self-evident, that we shall not poison one another. Actually it should be more precisely formulated: we shall not totally poison one another, for, ironically enough, it after all makes permissible the notorious and disputed "little bit." These regulations are thus not meant to prevent poisoning, but to set down the permissible limits of poisoning. There is no longer any question on the basis of these regulations that poisoning is permitted. Threshold values are in this respect the lines of retreat of a civili zation stocking up on a surfeit of pollutants and toxins. The com mand not to poison, which is actually directly self-evident, is rejected as Utopian. These false conclusions, which I will only mention here, provide the foundation for the "sorcery of threshold values" by the modem sorcerers in chemistry. 1. Threshold values are set for individual substances, although it is because of these threshold values that human beings and nature become a general receptacle for every possible pollutant and toxin in the air, water, ground, and food. An analogous argument applies for the interaction of individual poisons, about which we know practically nothing. As things stand, with the risks of civilization, human beings are</page><page sequence="16">66 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY threatened not by the sheer force of circumstances nor by individual pollutants, but by the cumulative amount of residual toxins. To answer the imperious question of the cumulative threat with tliresh old value tables for individual substances is tantamount to a per manent collective scoffing, with lethal consequences no longer even latent. It may be that this was an innocent enough misti ike in an era of general belief in progress; but to maintain it today, in the face of the general protests and the mortality and morbidity statis tics, and, what is more, under the legitimating authoritative um brella of scientific threshold-value rationality, goes far beyond a crisis of faith in its scale. 2. False conclusions are drawn from extremely variable results in animal experiments to human responses. Small animals respond quite differently; e.g., guinea pigs are 10 to 20 times more s en skive than mice and 3,000 to 5,000 times more sensitive than hamsters to the Seveso poison. The key question is how can one move from such radical variations in the results to human responses? Only through the "third eye." But that could be used from the start; then the poor animals would no longer even be needed. 3. Actual responses of human beings are not included in deter minations. Persons who have become ill must themselves prove that they are ill and how they became so. Thus we are living out a long-term broad-scale experiment with man as the involuntary experimental species, required to register the cumulative symp toms of poisoning, with the burden of proof reversed and siel high. Thus, those who juggle with threshold values need not e\en be concerned with the arguments of the persons affected because? and this really hurts?after all the threshold values that exist have been observed! Threshold values that actually could only be estab lished on the basis of human responses are held up to fend off anxieties and diseases in the affected experimental human beings! And this is all in the name of scientific rationality! Public consciousness of risks: second-hand non-experience The converse is true for a civilized consciousness that is crit.cal of science: in the end one must appeal to that against which one is arguing. From it one experiences one's justification: scientific ratio nality. One comes up against the hard law, sooner rather than later, that if risks are not scientifically recognized, they do not exist, at le ist not</page><page sequence="17">SPRING 1990 67 legally, medically, or technologically and socially, i.e., they are not hindered, treated, or compensated. No collective cough, itching, or groaning helps against this?only science. The monopoly that scien tific judgment has on truth thus forces those affected to make use of all the means and methods of scientific analysis to bring their claims to bear. The crisis in scientific authority can thus actually serve to put up a general smoke-screen around risks. The critique of science can also be counterproductive as far as recognizing risks is concerned. That which fundamentally eludes perception, i.e., second-hand non-experience, becomes an integral component of everyday thinking, experiencing, and acting in civilization's awareness of crisis. This fundamental theoretical trait of risk consciousness has also an anthropological significance. The risks of civilization give rise to a kind of new realm of shades, comparable to the gods and demons of primordial times, which conceals itself behind the visible world and imperils human life on this our earth. Nowadays one no longer communicates with spirits inherent in things; rather a person sees himself as exposed to radiation, swallows toxic ingredients, and is pursued by the anxieties of a impending nuclear holocaust even into his own dreams. An anthropomorphic interpre tation of nature and the environment has been replaced by the modern, civilized consciousness of risk with its imperceptible and yet universally present latent causality. Behind the harmless fa cades are dangerous, hostile ingredients. Everything must be seen in two ways, and indeed can only be correctly appreciated and adjudged in this duality. Accordingly, pollutants and toxins snigger at us from all sides and do their mischief like the devil in the Middle Ages. Human beings have been placed at their mercy, left with almost no escape. Breathing, eating, living, clothing?everything is pervaded by them. Going off on a trip is in the end of just as little help as eating muesli. Because at the end of one's journey, wherever it may be, they are there waiting, hidden in the cereal grains. Like the tortoise in his race with the hare, they are always there already. Their invisibility is no proof that they do not exist; rather, it gives almost unlimited space to their presumed mischief since their reality is manifested in the spheres of the invisible anyway. In contrast to the case of hunger and need, for risk, it is easier to fabricate interpretive detours to allay the insecurities and anxieties aroused. Because something is the product of past conditions does not mean that it can be overcome in those conditions as well; it can</page><page sequence="18">68 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY also be diverted in one direction or another, and symbolic sites, objects, and persons can be sought and found for overcoming anxiety. Thus, in the consciousness of risk, it is especially easy to displace thinking and acting, and social conflict. A society of risk contains an immanent tendency toward being a "scapegoat society" insofar as the hazards accumulate for want of political action. Suddenly it is not the risks themselves, but rather the persons who call attention to them who provoke general unrest. Are not ches, which are not always visible, opposed to visible risks? Is not the whole an intellectual fantasy, a desktop canard produced by intel lectual alarmists, and the dramaturg of risks? Aren't GDR spies, the Communists, the Jews, the Arabs, women, men, Turks, and/or asylum seekers ultimately behind the whole business? The growing sense of the irrational and the growing helplessness experienced in the face of a threat in fact favors radical and fanatical reactions and political currents. VII. Fifth thesis: A society of risk creates the political potential for a dirigist policy The dying of the forests brought home the point when the issue was still in swaddling clothes: where the risks are recognized, the world order changes, even when very little or nothing at all initially happens in action. The barriers of specialized competence fall. The public holds sway down to the technical details. Firms that for a long time were mollycoddled in the best spirit of a market economy for their tax charities and love-thy-neighbor job policies, suddenly find themselves in the dock being publicly pilloried and confronted with questions that previously barraged poisoners caught red-handed. If this were only all. But, markets collapse, costs are incmred by the firm, prohibitions and lawsuits threaten, and pressures are generated to bring the technical aspects of production up to date, and?the voters run away, whither no one knows precisely. Whereas formerly there was at least some presumed accord on the technical, economic, and legal details, now suddenly everyone talks in every which way, and from a quite different frame of reference as well. Economic and technical details are illuminated by the light of a new ecological morality. The old urgencie s merge with the threat, while at the same time the dirigist state-of-emer gency policy grows, extracting its expanded capabilities and pow</page><page sequence="19">SPRING 1990 69 ers of intervention from the threatening doom. When danger be comes the norm, it assumes a permanently institutionalized form. The risks of modernization are thus in this sense creating the groundwork for a partial redistribution of power, retaining the formal powers in some cases, and in others explicitly changing them. The more dramatically the dangers in the modernization process accumulate, the more patently the central values of the community are threatened, and the more clearly this enters the consciousness of all. Then all the more deeply will the power and authority structure in the relationship among economics, politics, and the public and the private domain be undermined, and the more prob able it will be that a redefinition of responsibilities will be bear the stamp of the impending danger, the powers to act will be central ized, and all the details of the modernization process will be covered over by bureaucratic controls and planning. In other words, the other side of danger is the legitimation and normalization of emergency action, making things seem self-evi dent that otherwise would be inconceivable and unrealizable. At the same time it becomes clear that totally new challenges to democracy arise in a society of risk as the dangers accumulate. A society of risk has a tendency toward legitimate totalitarianism to protect against dangers, making use of the right to prevent the one worst from happening to create the other worst in an all-too-famil iar way. The political side effects of the side effects of civilization threaten the very existence of the political democratic system. It finds itself in the thankless dilemma of either failing in the face of systematically produced dangers, or abolishing the fundamental principles of democracy by setting up the authoritarian pillars of a police state. To break up these alternatives and their spuriously self-evident appearance will probably become one of the essential tasks of democratic thinking and acting in the foreseeable future of the risk society.</page></plain_text>
