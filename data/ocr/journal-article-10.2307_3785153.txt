ELLIOTT,1 Missouri Department of Conservation, Atlanta, MO 63530, USA BRIAN G. ROOT,2 Missouri Department of Conservation, Columbia, MO 65201, USA Abstract Information about factors influencing forest-floor small mammals of midwestern riparian forests in agriculture-dominated areas is necessary for improved forest management. We determined occurrence and capture rates of forest-floor small mammal taxa at 4 northeastern Missouri riparian forests during 1995-2002. We modeled the effects of year, study site, and precipitation (flooding) on relative abundance of commonly captured taxa. We also evaluated changes in the species assemblage and capture rates resulting from silvicultural treatments (clearcut, basal area retention, and unharvested) at a 215-ha forest tract. We captured 12 taxa of forest-floor small mammals, of which 10 were captured at all sites. The species assemblages were dominated by habitat generalists, such as Peromyscus spp. and Sorex spp. Among-year variation in capture rates was large for all common taxa. Precipitation amounts during spring and summer were negatively correlated with relative abundances of several forest-floor small mammal taxa. We measured few changes in taxonomic composition or abundances of forest-floor small mammals in response to silvicultural treatments. There was some indication that Peromyscus spp. and short-tailed shrew (Blarina brevicauda) abundance decreased in areas where treatments increased fragmentation, but among-year differences accounted for more variation than treatment effects. We suggest that small mammal assemblages in fragmented midwestern riparian forests are dominated by habitat generalists and their abundances are primarily affected by variability in environmental conditions (especially flooding during the breeding season). Silvicultural treatments may have minimal effects on taxonomic composition or abundance, as long as forests are allowed to regenerate, mature forest blocks are maintained, and other important factors (e.g., hydrology) are not altered.

Riparian ecosystems associated with river corridors and floodplains can provide habitat for a diversity of plant and wildlife species, improve water quality, reduce soil erosion, and provide recrea- tional opportunities (Stauffer and Best 1980, Shaw and Mangun 1984, Murray and Stauffer 1995). Riparian forests and their associated floodplains also provide economic benefits through timber production, recreation, flood control, or conversion for agriculture and grazing (Abernethy and Turner 1987, Bacon 1990, Sparks et al. 1998). Riparian forests within agriculture-dominated landscapes of the midwestern United States, although typically small, fragmented, and linear, provide unique habitats for many species of birds, herpetofauna, and mammals (Best et al. 1995, Lannoo 1998, Rosenblatt et al. 1999). Ecosystem conversion has led to additional fragmentation and loss of forested riparian areas throughout much of the United States (Abernethy and Turner 1987). In Missouri, bottomland hardwoods were reduced at an average annual rate of 14,000 ha during 1940-1980, resulting in a cumulative loss of over 560,000 ha (Abernethy and Turner 1987). Efforts to reduce the loss of riparian forests and associated biotic resources stimulated research on riparian ecosystems, particularly in the western United States (Kauffman and Krueger 1984, Johnson et al. 1985, Olson and Knopf 1988, Davidson and Knight 2001) and development of 1 E-mail: Tony.Elliott@mdc.mo.gov 2 Present address: United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Carlsbad, CA 9201 1, USA riparian-ecosystem management guidelines (Bacon 1990, Ice 1990, Blinn and Kilgore 2001). Current management objectives in agricultural landscapes such as the midwestern United States include maintenance of existing riparian forest tracts, restoration of vegetated riparian and wetland buffers, and maximizing biological diversity (Missouri Depart- ment of Conservation [MDC] 1986, 1990, United States Forest Service [USFS] 2002). Many guidelines currently in place to achieve these goals restrict forest management and timber harvest within riparian forests (Missouri Department of Conservation 1986, Ice 1990, Blinn and Kilgore 2001, United States Forest Service 2002), mainly because they were originally established to protect water and in-stream habitat quality (Ice 1990, Missouri Department of Conservation 1990). However, use of silvicultural techniques to manipulate vegetation composition and structure may provide both economic and biotic benefits, including improved terrestrial wildlife habitat (Bacon 1990). Riparian forests are dynamic systems subject to frequent disturbances, particularly flooding (Gregory et al. 1991, Andersen et al. 2000). Therefore, anthropomorphic disturbances such as manipulative forest management may help maintain or enhance forest resources (Bacon 1990). Baseline information about the biota of riparian forests and knowledge of how these areas respond to different management activities can provide resource managers and the public a scientific basis to make decisions for maintaining functional riparian forests. Documenting vertebrate use of riparian forests in the Midwest Elliott and Root * Riparian Small Mammals and Disturbance 485</page><page sequence="2">generally has focused on breeding songbirds, especially Neo- tropical migrants (Knutson et al. 1996). Species composition and abundances of less mobile, nonvolant, and resident species such as small mammals may be better indicators of local-landscape habitat quality for riparian forest tracts (Findlay and Houlahan 1997, Barko et al. 2003). Small mammal response to silviculture has been much studied in North America, particularly in western (Gashwiler 1970, Hooven 1973, Ramirez and Hornocker 1981, Scott et al. 1982, Sullivan and Sullivan 1982) and eastern (Krull 1970, Kirkland 1977, Monthey and Soutiere 1985, Clough 1987) forests. Most studies have examined silvicultural effects on forest-floor small mammals within relatively large forest tracts or uplands (Root et al. 1990, Yahner 1992, Carey and Wilson 2001, Fantz and Renken 2005). This previous work often has documented short-term increases in small mammal abundances in response to silvicultural treatment, although results have varied substantially (Kirkland 1977, 1990; Yahner 1992; Carey and Wilson 2001). Changes in species composition also have been documented in response to silvicul- tural treatment, especially in large upland forest blocks (Kirkland 1990). However, responses could be different in ecosystems prone to frequent disturbance, such as riparian forests. We documented forest-floor small mammal species assemblages and relative abundances in riparian-forest stands in northeastern Missouri and modeled the effects of several factors (precipitation, year, study site) that we believed might affect abundance. We predicted that forest-floor small mammal species assemblages would consist mainly of habitat generalists (Geier and Best 1980, Yahner 1983; B. G. Root, MDC, Columbia, Mo., USA, and F. R. Thompson, III, USFS, Columbia, Mo., USA, unpublished data) and that among-year variation in abundance would be great because of the small size and linear, disturbance-prone nature of these riparian forests. We also predicted that flooding and precipitation would affect abundances among years because flooding and weather are major disturbances in riparian forests and may affect small mammal populations (Ruffer 1961, Myers et al. 1985, Lewellen and Vessey 1998, Andersen et al. 2000). At our largest riparian forest site, we documented short-term (1- to 3-year) changes in species assemblages and abundances of individual taxa resulting from silvicultural treatments. We also modeled temporal effects of silvicultural treatments on abundances. We predicted that silvicultural management in fragmented riparian forest tracts would not affect taxonomic composition because habitat-generalist species assemblages should be tolerant of changes resulting from disturbance (Kaufman et al. 1983, Yahner 1992, Bellows et al. 2001). However, we predicted that small mammal relative abundance would increase following silvicultural management because of increased vegetative structure, down-dead wood volume, and food availability at or near ground level (Kirkland 1990, Suzuki and Hayes 2003, Fantz and Renken 2005). Study Sites We conducted trapping at 4 sites on 3 conservation areas (CAs) owned and managed by MDC-Atlanta CA, Deer Ridge CA, and Mussel Fork CA. We chose these sites nonrandomly, based on several criteria: 1) mostly mature, closed-canopy bottomland forest (undisturbed for &gt;50 years); 2) state ownership, to facilitate long-term access and control of management activities; 3) contiguous bottomland forest blocks &gt;20 ha; and 4) logistical feasibility of conducting long-term, intensive monitoring and silvicultural treatment (e.g., site access by vehicles and logging equipment). The Atlanta CA site (39052'0"N, 92029'0'W) was a 50-ha bottomland forest located along Long Branch Creek (fourth order) in Macon County. Bottomland forest at this site was narrow (total floodplain 75-175 m wide, including both banks of the creek) and linear, but was contiguous with approximately 200 ha of upland forest. The Deer Ridge CA site (40010'30'N, 91'48'0'W) was a 215- ha bottomland forest adjacent to a channelized segment of the North Fabius River (fifth order) in Lewis County. Deer Ridge CA comprised one of the largest remnant bottomland forest tracts in northeastern Missouri, with a forested floodplain 350-600 m wide (mostly on the west bank of the river). The bottomland forest was partially contiguous with approximately 1,500 ha of upland forest. The Mussel Fork Creek site (39044'0"N, 92051'30"W) was a 40-ha bottomland forest within Mussel Fork CA, adjacent to both channelized and unchannelized segments of Mussel Fork Creek (fourth order) in Linn County. Forested floodplain width was 200-300 m (mostly on the west bank of the creek). The bottomland forest was contiguous with a 65-ha block of upland forest. The Van Dorsen Creek site (39044'30'N, 92053'0'W) was a 20- ha riparian forest also within Mussel Fork CA in Linn County but adjacent to Van Dorsen Creek (second order), approximately 2 km west of the Mussel Fork Creek site. This site was most dissimilar from the other study sites. Although portions were relatively wide (total width 100-300 m), the Van Dorsen Creek floodplain occurred at greater relative elevation from the deeply incised creek and therefore had a drier hydrology and coarser, loamier soils. The bottomland forest was not contiguous with any substantial blocks of upland forest. Forest structure and composition at all sites, except Van Dorsen Creek, were similar (Root et al. 2003). Overstory (&gt;11.4-cm diameter at breast height [DBH]) tree stem density was 388.7/ha (SE - 12.5) and basal area was 22.2 m2/ha (SE = 1.0), with species composition dominated by silver maple (Acer saccharinum), American elm (Ulmus americana), hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), boxelder (A. negundo), shellbark hickory (Carya laciniosa), green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), pin oak (Quercus palustris), eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides), and sycamore (Platanus occidenta- lis). Midcanopy (3.8- to 11.3-cm DBH) tree stem density was 351.8/ha (SE = 52.9) and basal area was 1.4 m2/ha (SE = 0.2), with species composition dominated by American elm, hackberry, silver maple, Ohio buckeye (Aesculus glabra), green ash, and shellbark hickory. Shrub-layer (&gt;1-m tall, &lt;3.8-cm DBH) stem density averaged 3,217/ha (SE = 552); species composition was dominated by buckbrush (Symphoricarpos orbiculatus), elderberry (Sambucus canadensis), blackhaw (Viburnum prunifolium), Ameri- can elm, silver maple, hazelnut (Corylus americana), Virginia creeper (Parthenocissus quinquefolia), and poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans). Forbs dominated the herbaceous vegetation layer; foliar cover was dominated by wood nettle (Laportea canadensis), black snakeroot (Sanicula odorata), clearweed (Pilea pumila), honewort 486 Wildlife Society Bulletin * 34(2)</page><page sequence="3">(Cryptotaenia canadensis), and swamp buttercup (Ranunculus hispidus). The Van Dorsen Creek site was the most dissimilar in woody vegetation species composition relative to the other sites, likely due to its higher-elevation, better-drained floodplain (Root et al. 2003). At Van Dorsen Creek, we recorded no silver maple but an increased prevalence of shellbark hickory, slippery elm (U. rubra), black walnut (Juglans nigra), and white oaks (bur [Q. macrocarpa] and swamp white [Q. bicolor]). The Van Dorsen Creek site also had the greatest abundance of oaks (both red and white species) in the midcanopy. Silvicultural Treatments We applied 4 silvicultural treatments at Deer Ridge CA during 1999 and early 2000. Our original design was to treat 24 forest blocks, each 2.5-3.5 ha, within a treatment matrix unit with balanced (n = 8) replicates of 3 treatments: 1) clearcut (CC), with slashing of all stems &gt;2.5-cm DBH; 2) basal area-retention (BAR) harvest, leaving approximately 4.6 m2 basal area/ha of "desirable" species (e.g., a mix of oak, maple, hackberry, ash), with slashing of all stems &gt;11.4-cm DBH; and 3) unharvested. In addition, we established 5 sampling points in a 75-ha unit of unharvested forest (approximately 500 m upstream from the treatment matrix unit), to serve as a fourth treatment (UNH) that could be compared to the smaller unharvested blocks within the treatment matrix unit (MUNH). Treatment blocks were stratified so that, within each treatment type, we proportionally sampled in riverfront (natural levees with higher elevation and better-drained soils) and floodplain (lower-elevation sites, generally with hydric soils prone to extended flooding) locations. On 8 April 1999, a tornado severely damaged all or parts of 4 harvest blocks. Timber in 3 of these blocks was commercially salvaged, becoming additional CC treatments; we left the fourth damaged block unsalvaged, essentially becoming a BAR treatment block. These changes produced our final treatment design (Fig. 1). Overall, harvested areas comprised 50 ha (36%) of the 140-ha treatment matrix unit. Silvicultural treatments substantially altered the woody vegeta- tion structure at Deer Ridge CA, particularly down-dead wood volume and basal area of both living and dead standing trees. Between 1997 and 2000, down-dead wood volume increased 240% and 315% in BAR and CC treatments, respectively, while basal area of standing live trees decreased by 68% in BAR and 91% in CC treatments. Basal area of standing dead trees increased 133% and 283% in BAR and CC treatments, respectively, between 1997 and 2000 because of trees girdled during slashing, but declined slightly by 2002 as some girdled trees were wind-thrown. Methods Trapping Herpetofaunal arrays, including pitfall traps, were established as part of a broad study of riparian ecology. Trapping methods followed the Guidelines for the Use of Live Amphibians and Reptiles in Field Research (Anonymous 1987). Because pitfalls are effective at capturing a diverse suite of forest-floor small mammals, including insectivores (Jones et al. 1996), our sampling effort was designed to gather data on herpetofaunal and small mammal species assemblages concurrently. Mortality rates of pitfall- captured small mammals are often large, emphasizing the need to gather useful data from these captures (Corn 1994; see Karraker 2001 for a review of methods that may reduce small mammal mortality in pitfall traps and a potential method for allowing small mammals to escape while trapping amphibians). We instructed crews on the possible disease vectors likely to be encountered and how best to minimize exposure at the beginning of each field season. We provided all workers with rubber gloves and disposable High Efficiency Particulate Air filter (HEPA) respirators. Trapping arrays consisted of 4 7.6-m drift fences oriented in the cardinal directions with a 7.6-m gap between fences at the center of the array, similar to Campbell and Christman's (1982) design. Each fence was 0.61 m high and constructed of aluminum flashing buried 13 cm into the ground. At the ends of all fences we installed a 19-L pitfall trap (n = 8 pitfalls per array). Minimum distance between arrays was 90 m at Atlanta CA and Mussel Fork Creek, 115 m at Deer Ridge CA, and 120 m at Van Dorsen Creek. We identified all captured small mammals to genus or species. We released captured animals if they were alive or collected them if dead. Taxonomy and nomenclature follow Wilson and Reeder (1993). Sampling effort varied among study sites and years due to personnel availability and logistic issues (e.g., flooding, damaged arrays). We trapped from 1995 to 2002 at Atlanta and Deer Ridge CAs, except during 1998 at Atlanta CA (due to personnel availability) and 1999 at Deer Ridge CA (because of silvicultural harvest logistics). We trapped at Mussel Fork and Van Dorsen Creeks from 1999 to 2001. At all study sites, we trapped from mid-May through mid-August each year, and checked open traps once daily. During 1995-1998 we opened pitfall traps on 4 consecutive nights per week. Sampling effort was reduced during 1995 because of severe flooding throughout the summer. During 1999-2002 we increased trapping effort by keeping pitfall traps open continuously (7 nights per week). We trapped at 12 arrays at Atlanta CA, 10 arrays along Mussel Fork Creek, and 5 arrays along Van Dorsen Creek. At Deer Ridge CA, we trapped at 12 arrays within the treatment matrix unit during 1995-1997. Beginning in 1997 we trapped at 5 additional arrays located in the UNH unit. In 1998 we redesigned our sampling layout within the Deer Ridge CA treatment matrix unit, as part of an expanded trapping effort to more thoroughly evaluate silvicultural treatment effects. We centered an array within each treatment block, resulting in a final sampling design with 25 arrays within the treatment matrix unit and 5 arrays within the UNH unit during 1998-2002. General Calculations We defined a "trap day" as 1 array with &gt;3 fences fully functional for 24 hours. We considered a fence nonfunctional if any conditions made it likely that an animal encountering the fence or an associated trap would not be captured (e.g., a flooded pitfall trap that allowed animals to swim out). We classified 2 morphologically similar shrews, masked shrew (Sorex cinereus) and southeastern shrew (S. longirostris), as "Sorex spp." because time constraints did not allow for consistent field identification. We also classified white-footed mice (Peromyscus Elliott and Root * Riparian Small Mammals and Disturbance 487</page><page sequence="4">-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ J Figure 1. Silvicultural treatment design for Deer Ridge Conservation Area in northeastern Mo., USA. In clearcut blocks all stems &gt;2.5-cm diameter at breast height (DBH) were slashed, whereas basal-area-retention harvest blocks were thinned to leave approximately 4.6 m2 basal area/ha of "desirable" species (e.g., a mix of oak, maple, hackberry, ash) and all stems &gt;11 .4-cm DBH were slashed. Salvage-harvested tornado-affected blocks were structurally similar to clearcuts and the unsalvaged tornado-affected block was structurally similar to a basal-area-retention harvest. Treatments were applied autumn 1999 through spring 2000. leucopus) and deer mice (P. maniculatus) as "Peromyscus spp." because of documented inaccuracies in field identifications, especially for subadults (Palas et al. 1992, Sternburg and Feldhamer 1997, Kamler et al. 1998, Bruseo et al. 1999). For baseline population summaries, we grouped captures of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), meadow voles (M pennsylvanicus), woodland voles (M pinetorum), and southern bog lemmings (Synaptomys cooperi) into "Microtus spp." because of inconsisten- cies in field identifications during 1999. We believed that these taxonomic groupings would not affect the management implica- tions of our study because habitat partitioning among the species within these groupings is occurring at a finer scale than we were measuring (Baugh et al. 2004, Manning and Edge 2004). We standardized all capture data to number ofcaptures per 100 trap days and used these data as an index of relative abundance (Bellows et al. 2001, Carey and Wilson 2001, Barko et al. 2003, Suzuki and Hayes 2003). Mortality rates of captured individuals were large, especially for Sorex spp. (90%), short-tailed shrews (Blarina brevicauda; 85%), and least shrews (Cryptotis parva; 73%). Other taxa mortality rates were lower but still considerable (Microtus spp., 32% and Peromyscus spp., 35%). Most capture mortality resulted from drowning or hypothermia because of water accumulation in pitfalls. Because of high mortality rates and low recapture rates (&lt; 5% of n = 140 uniquely marked small mammals captured during additional sampling at Atlanta CA in 2003 [A. G. Elliott, MDC, Columbia, Mo., USA, unpublished data]), we assumed that multiple recapture bias was minimal and consistent within each taxon. Baseline Population Information Taxonomic richness and abundance.-We tabulated small mammal taxonomic composition (richness) among study sites. For Deer Ridge CA during 2000-2002, we included data only from the UNH unit. For individual taxa we used 95% confidence limits to compare mean annual capture rates within and among sites because changes in our sampling design and trapping effort violated the assumptions of most statistical tests. Additionally, we expected a large amount of among-year variance heterogeneity and confidence limits are conservative tests that reduce probabilities of making Type II errors (Payton et al. 2003). Explanatory factors.-To examine relationships among small mammal capture rates, flooding, and precipitation, we acquired daily stream gauge data (http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis) from relevant gauging stations and daily precipitation data (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, National Climatic Data Center, www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html) from 4 to 5 weather stations within 50 km of each of our study sites. We defined seasons as autumn-winter (Sep through Feb prior to the trapping period) to address effects on nonbreeding and overwintering refugia and spring-summer (Mar through Aug prior to and induding the trapping period) to address effects on breeding refugia and habitat for raising young. Within each season we summed the number of days with over-bank flooding. We calculated the mean daily precipitation from the weather stations associated with each CA and summed the daily means to get total seasonal precipitation. Seasonal over-bank flood events and 488 Wildlife Society Bulletin * 34(2)</page><page sequence="5">precipitation were positively correlated (autumn-winter: r = 0.85, P &lt; 0.001; spring-summer: r = 0.63, P = 0.012) and therefore would bias analyses if parameters for both factors were included. We used seasonal precipitation values in these analyses as surrogate parameters for flood events because flood event data were not available from Mussel Fork and Van Dorsen creeks and because we believed that precipitation events could directly affect small mammals (Myers et al. 1985, Lewellen and Vessey 1998). We modeled the effects of precipitation (spring-summer and autumn-winter), year (to account for among-year effects), and study site (to account for geographic, hydrologic, and vegetation differences) on capture rates of the 5 most commonly captured small mammal taxa (short-tailed shrews, least shrews, Microtus spp., Peromyscus spp., and Sorex spp.) using PROC GENMOD (SAS Institute 2000). We developed 8 a priori models that included individual and additive combinations of the 3 explan- atory factors, as well as a null (intercept only) model. We applied an information-theoretic approach (Akaike 1973) using Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for small sample bias (AIC,; Burnham and Anderson 2002) to evaluate the relative strength of candidate models in explaining our data. Models were evaluated based on minimizing Akaike distances (AAIC,; the difference from the smallest AICJ) and maximizing normalized Akaike weights (wAICj). We used a likelihood ratio test (Burnham and Anderson 2002) to evaluate model fit, comparing the difference in likelihood values between the global (full) and null models, with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in number of each model's estimable parameters. We based inferences on parameter estimates from the best-supported models. We log-transformed values for autumn-winter precipitation, spring-summer precip- itation, and capture rates of least shrews, Microtus spp., and Sorex spp. because visual examination of residual plots indicated that log-transformations increased variance homogeneity. Silvicultural Treatments Taxonomic richness and abundance.-To evaluate general effects on small mammal taxonomic composition and relative abundance, we tabulated overall capture rates among treatments for pretreatment (1998) and posttreatment (2000-2002) years. We did not tabulate 1995-1997 data because trapping arrays were not located within specific treatment blocks until 1998. In these summaries we assessed individual Microtus species (prairie vole, meadow vole, woodland vole) because we were confident of the accuracy of our species identifications during this period. Explanatory factors.-We captured 6 small mammal taxa- short-tailed shrews, least shrews, meadow voles, prairie voles, Peromyscus spp., and Sorex spp.-with adequate numbers to model potential silvicultural treatment effects on capture rates. To assess treatment effects on capture rates, we developed 5 a priori models including additive and multiplicative combinations of treatment, year, and array location (riverfront, floodplain), plus a null (intercept only) model. We created a treatment X year model, using the categorical treatment variable to represent changes in vegetation structure among the silvicultural treatments. We did not include treatment-only (i.e., BAR, CC, MUNH, UNH) or year-only models because we were evaluating 1 pretreatment year along with 3 posttreatment years and, therefore, assumed any treatment or year effects would be best evaluated within the treatment x year interaction. We fitted models with PROC GENMOD (SAS Institute 2000) with year (SUBJECT= array) as the repeated measure. We assessed support for candidate models using model selection procedures similar to those we used for the baseline population information (Akaike 1973, Burnham and Anderson 2002). We evaluated the appropriateness of the global model for each species with a deviance goodness-of-fit test (Stokes et al. 2000). We log- transformed capture data because visual examination of residual plots indicated that log-transformations increased variance homogeneity. For the best-supported model of each species, we present parameter estimates and pair-wise multiple comparisons. We examined pair-wise differences between least squares estimates using x2 probabilities and Bonferroni adjustments to control for comparison-wide error rates of P &lt; 0.05. Results Baseline Population Information Taxonomic richness and abundance.-Forest-floor small mammal species assemblages generally were similar among our 4 study sites. We captured 12 taxa of forest-floor small mammals during 1995-2002 (Table 1), 10 of which were captured at all 4 study sites. Additionally, we documented the presence of 5 nontarget (larger or more arboreal) mammal species (Table 1). Capture rates of all common taxa had substantial among-year variation (Fig. 2). Capture rates among study sites were similar for most taxa, except that, generally, capture rates of Sorex spp. were substantially greater at Deer Ridge CA than at other study sites. Although there were some differences in capture rates for individual taxa among study sites within years, the greatest differences were among years. Least shrews had relatively stable but lesser capture rates except during 1999 and 2002 when rates increased abruptly at all study sites (Fig. 2). Short-tailed shrew capture rates tended to increase from 1996 to 2002, with few abrupt changes in rates among consecutive years. Microtus spp. capture rates increased during 1997 at Atlanta and Deer Ridge CAs, but decreased substantially in 1998 at Deer Ridge CA and in 1999 at Atlanta CA. Microtus spp. capture rates also increased from 2001 to 2002 at Atlanta CA. Peromyscus spp. capture rates were relatively consistent between consecutive years, although rates increased from 1996 to 1997 at Atlanta and Deer Ridge CAs. Sorex spp. capture rates peaked during 2000 at Atlanta and Deer Ridge CAs. Explanatory factors.-Likelihood ratio tests for all species indicated that the global models fit our data better than the null models (Table 2). Precipitation was included in the best- supported model for 4 of the 5 most commonly captured small mammal taxa (Table 2). For least shrews, Microtus spp., and Peromyscus spp., the model that included only precipitation parameters was best supported, while for Sorex spp., the best- supported model also included study site parameters. For Microtus spp., Peromyscus spp., and Sorex spp., capture rates were negatively correlated with spring-summer precipitation (Table 3). However, capture rates of least shrews were positively correlated with autumn-winter precipitation. For Sorex spp., the best-supported model also indicated that capture rates at Deer Ridge CA were Elliott and Root * Riparian Small Mammals and Disturbance 489</page><page sequence="6">Table 1.

In contrast, the best- supported model for short-tailed shrews indicated that year effects best explained abundance, with capture rates greatest during 2001 and 2002 (Table 3). Silvicultural Treatments Taxonomic richness and abundance.-Small mammal species composition and capture rates were similar among treatment types, both before and immediately after silvicultural treatment (Table 4). Sorex spp. capture rates during 2000 were greater than 1998 rates at all treatments except the large unharvested unit, but capture rates in these areas were substantially reduced during 2001 and 2002.

Likelihood ratio test results are listed parenthetically after each taxon name. The TREATMENT X YEAR model was best supported for short-tailed shrews and both vole species, whereas the TREAT- MENT x YEAR + LOCATION model was best supported for the other 3 taxa (Table 5). Array location was included in 1 of the 2 best-supported models for all taxa, but the LOCATION model was never strongly supported. This suggested that location alone was not a strong explanatory factor but helped reduce variation in otherwise well-supported models. In agreement with our capture rate data (Table 4), least-squares mean estimates from the best-supported models for least shrews, prairie voles, meadow voles, and Sorex spp. (Table 6A-D) indicated substantial annual variation in capture rates but little or no difference among silvicultural treatments. Array location was an additive factor in the best-supported least shrew (Table 6A) and Sorex spp. (Table 6D) models, indicating greater capture rates in the higher-elevation, better-drained riverfront locations. Least squares means estimates from the best-supported models for short-tailed shrew and Peromyscus spp. suggested potential treatment effects extending into the MUNH blocks. For short- tailed shrews, capture rates in the CC treatments were reduced compared to the UNH unit during 2000-2002 and rates in the other matrix treatments were reduced during 2001 (Table 6E).

Study sites are AT = Atlanta Conservation Area, DR = Deer Ridge Conservation Area, MF = Mussel Fork Creek. c Comparisons made to 2002. For Peromyscus spp., there was a general decline in capture rates from 1998 through 2002, but declines were more pronounced for treatments within the matrix unit (Table 6F). While there were no differences among treatments in 1998 (pretreatment), capture rates in the UNH unit were greater than in the CC and MUNH treatments in 2000 and all 3 other treatments in 2001 and 2002. Array location appeared to affect Peromyscus spp. abundance, with greater capture rates in higher-elevation, better-drained riverfront locations. Discussion Riparian forests are dynamic systems, and associated small mammal species assemblages are impacted by many factors, including predation levels, weather, natural disturbance (e.g., flooding), and human disturbance (e.g., forest management; Geier and Best 1980, Bacon 1990, Gregory et al. 1991, Andersen et al. 2000). Our data indicated large annual variability in small mammal abundances, which were correlated with precipitation and flooding events. Flooding (and other natural factors) appeared to have greater short-term effects on the small mammal assemblage than our silvicultural treatments. Our silvicultural treatments involved relatively small harvest blocks (2.5-3.5 ha) and all slash material was left where it fell. More intensive harvest methods (e.g., larger blocks, whole tree removal, or site scraping) may have greater effects on forest-floor small mammals (Kirkland 1990), especially when in conjunction with the natural dis- turbances common in these ecosystems. Baseline Population Information Forest-floor small mammal species assemblages and relative abundances were similar among our 4 study sites. However, capture rates of Sorex spp. were consistently greater at Deer Ridge CA than at the 3 other sites. The relatively wide tract of riparian forest at Deer Ridge CA seemed to provide a variety of moist, forest-floor habitats highly suitable for Sorex spp. (Getz 1961). House mice (Mus musculus) and western harvest mice (Reithro- dontomys megalotis) were the only taxa not captured at all 4 sites. The house mouse, an introduced species most common near human habitation (Cummings and Vessey 1994, Schwartz and Schwartz 2001), was not commonly captured at any of our study sites, although it was captured at 3 of the 4 sites. The western harvest mouse is an old-field-associated species and may be present, although in low abundance, at many fragmented riparian forest tracts (Schwartz and Schwartz 2001). Forest-floor small mammal species richness and composition at our sites was similar to values reported from other areas. Comparisons with other studies are necessarily qualitative because of biases among various trapping methods (O'Farrell et al. 1994, Yu 1994, Torre et al. 2004) and sampling effort. In a southwestern Iowa riparian forest, Geier and Best (1980) documented 8 species, including 6 taxa (meadow vole, western harvest mouse, Peromyscus spp., house mouse, masked shrew, short-tailed shrew) captured in our study. At 6 narrow riparian buffers in northeastern Missouri, 7 taxa (Sorex spp., Peromyscus spp., short-tailed shrew, meadow vole, woodland vole, meadow jumping mouse [Zapus hudsonius], eastern mole [Scalopus aquaticus]) were captured during 2001; these taxa were a subset of those present at our larger riparian forests (B. G. Root, MDC and F. R. Thompson, III, USFS, unpublished data). Elliott et al. (1997) captured 9 species, including 4 taxa (western harvest mouse, prairie vole, Peromyscus sp., meadow jumping mouse) present in our study, in a small riparian corridor in southeastern Wyoming. 492 Wildlife Society Bulletin * 34(2)</page><page sequence="9">In Minnesota farmstead-shelterbelts, another linear woody habitat, Yahner (1983) captured 10 small mammal species, including short-tailed shrews, Peromyscus spp., meadow voles, masked shrews, and house mice, and in an agricultural area of northwest Ohio, Cummings and Vessey (1994) captured 8 small mammal species occurring among several upland vegetation types, including 4 taxa (Peromyscus sp., short-tailed shrew, house mouse, meadow vole) in common with our study. In a fragmented upland forest in Pennsylvania, Yahner (1986, 1992) captured 9 species, including 5 taxa (Peromyscus sp., short-tailed shrew, masked shrew, house mouse, southern bog lemming) in common with our study. In &gt;25-year-old upland forests in West Virginia, Kirkland (1977) captured 11 small mammal species, including 4 taxa (short-tailed shrew, masked shrew, Peromyscus spp., house mouse) in common with our study. Our capture of taxa that were also captured in several other studies conducted across different ecosystems and a wide geographical range demonstrates the habitat-generalist nature of these taxa. Conditions such as flooding or drought may be major disturbances affecting forest-floor small mammal abundance. Our results suggested that increased precipitation during the spring and summer negatively impacted the relative abundance of several small mammal taxa (e.g., Peromyscus spp. and Sorex spp.). Exposure to heavy precipitation events during early pregnancy has been reported to reduce litter size in deer mice (Myers et al. 1985), potentially reducing abundance. Conversely, precipitation can increase activity levels of shrews (Getz 1961, Bury and Corn 1987), possibly increasing capture rates (Sarrazin and Bider 1973), although the predicted positive correlation between precipitation and shrew capture rates did not occur in some cases (Laakkonen et al. 2003, Greenberg and Miller 2004). We believe that flood events resulting from increased precipitation levels were negatively affecting short-term small mammal abundances, likely by reducing foraging and reproductive habitat quality (Ruffer 1961, Andersen et al. 2000). Spring and summer flooding, which occurs regularly in these riparian systems, retards annual herbaceous vegetation growth, and can be directly detrimental to small mammals that take refuge on or near the ground (Andersen et al. 2000). Andersen et al. (2000) reported that during annual spring flooding, nonarboreal small mammals in flood-prone riparian areas did not readily abandon their home ranges and were at risk of drowning or being swept away by floodwaters. Both Ruffer (1961) and Andersen et al. (2000) found that Peromyscus spp. moved to higher ground and utilized arboreal refugia within flood-prone home ranges to avoid inundation but did not abandon those home ranges, therefore remaining vulnerable to deep or extended inundation. Northeastern Missouri did not experience any extended periods of drought during 1995-2002, so we could not assess potential drought impacts on small mammals. However, in Pennsylvania, Yahner (1992) attributed reduced small mammal abundances (especially Sorex shrews) during drought to negative effects on terrestrial arthropod availability as a food resource. In an Ohio study, white-footed mouse abundances were reduced, possibly because of reduced seed crops during drought periods (Lewellen and Vessey 1998). In our study, comparatively dry periods (e.g., 1997 and 2000) also were periods of relatively greater abundance for some taxa (e.g., Microtus spp. and Sorex spp.), supporting our contention that reduced flooding positively affected short-term small mammal abundances in these flood-prone sites. Our modeling effort examining the effects of silvicultural treatment also supported the importance of flooding because 3 taxa had greater abundances in the riverfront locations. The higher- elevation, better-drained riverfront locations were subject to shorter and shallower inundation compared to the floodplain locations, potentially reducing the impacts of flooding on small mammals. Silvicultural Treatments Despite substantial alteration of vegetative structure at Deer Ridge CA resulting from silvicultural treatment, short-term (1-3 yr posttreatment) effects on small mammals were neither large nor consistent. In agreement with our prediction, we found no short- term change in composition of the species assemblage in response to silvicultural management, likely due to the dominance of habitat-generalist taxa and presence of old-field-associated taxa in our generally mature forest stands (Table 4). Also, the small size of harvest blocks in this study may have allowed rapid recolonization from adjacent undisturbed areas compensating for potential treatment effects. Because riparian ecosystems are linear and prone to natural disturbances (e.g., wind-throw, flooding), this taxonomic composition and potential for rapid recolonization are predictable. Silvicultural management increases fragmentation within riparian forest stands, which favors continued dominance of habitat-generalist taxa (Kaufman et al. 1983, Yahner 1983, Bellows et al. 2001) and sustains the presence of old-field- associated taxa. Fantz and Renken (2002) reported no change in species composition 1-3 years after timber harvest in large (&gt;312- 514 ha) stands of oak-hickory forest in southern Missouri. Yahner (1992) reported little change in species composition across a gradient of increasing forest fragmentation due to clearcutting in Pennsylvania. However, Kirkland (1990), in a summary of published literature from North American forests, reported shifts in species composition resulting from clearcutting. "Nonforest"- associated species, such as jumping mice (Zapus spp.), were captured only in recently harvested areas, whereas species more closely associated with mature forests were captured only in unharvested sites. We predicted that the increased amount of down-dead wood, shrubby vegetation, herbaceous growth, and spatial heterogeneity resulting from harvest would increase habitat quality for both generalist forest-floor and old-field-associated small mammals (Kaufman et al. 1983, Kirkland 1990, Bellows et al. 2001, Carey and Wilson 2001), therefore causing short-term increases in abundance. However, we did not measure increased capture rates for any taxa postharvest, and abundances of 2 taxa (short-tailed shrews and Peromyscus spp.) may have exhibited brief, minor declines in both harvested and unharvested areas within our treatment matrix unit. The extension of possible treatment effects into adjacent unharvested areas may have resulted from harvests increasing fragmentation within the unit. Few studies have reported responses of short-tailed shrews to silvicultural manage- ment, but Kirkland (1977) reported decreased abundance in recent clearcuts (&lt;5 yr since harvest) in northern Appalachian forests, possibly as a result of drier microclimates.

(6-15 yr since harvest), however, short-tailed shrew abundance was similar to abundance in mature forest stands (Kirkland 1977), demonstrating the short-term nature of this potential response. Several studies have examined the response of Peromyscus spp. to silvicultural management (Kirkland 1990, Root et al. 1990, Suzuki and Hayes 2003, Fantz and Renken 2005). In a review of 10 studies comparing abundance in recently clearcut stands (&lt;5 years postharvest) to unharvested stands in deciduous forests (Kirkland 1990), 7 reported lower abundance of Peromyscus spp. in harvested stands and 3 reported greater abundance in harvested stands.

(1990) reported that white-footed mouse carrying capacity increased slightly in clearcuts, but patterns of among-year variation in abundance were similar between harvested and unharvested areas. Fantz and Renken (2005) reported that Peromyscus spp. in southern Missouri upland oak-hickory forests had greater abundance in harvested areas 2-5 years posttreatment. Their conclusions were based on declining abundance in unharvested areas during postharvest sampling, while abundances in harvested areas were similar among pre- and postharvest periods. Reported inconsistent responses of this well-studied, generalist taxon to habitat disturbance demonstrate the need to isolate sources of variation (e.g., forest type, study design, abundance periodicity; Elias et al. 2004, Fantz and Renken 2005) and determine appropriate scales of habitat measures (e.g., individual home-range vs. stand scales; Manning and Edge 2004). One source of variation that we were unable to address was potential interspecific interactions within our Peromyscus spp. group. Whereas Peromyscus spp. generally are considered habitat generalists, in Missouri white-footed mice are a more forest- associated species while deer mice are more strongly associated with old-field and open-land areas (Schwartz and Schwartz 2001). Based on these associations, we believed that white-footed mice comprised the majority of Peromyscus spp. captures within our mature forest sites. However, the substantial changes in vegetation structure caused by silvicultural harvest at Deer Ridge CA could have caused a shift toward greater deer mouse abundance and increased interspecific competition within harvested areas. The unknown influence of this factor emphasizes the need to develop a field-based metric to accurately distinguish between these morphologically similar species, especially subadults (Palas et al. 1992, Sternburg and Feldhamer 1997, Kamler et al. 1998, Bruseo et al. 1999).

Riparian areas are considered important ecosystems that support diverse floral and faunal communities (Murray and Stauffer 1995, Knutson et al. 1996, Lannoo 1998, Rosenblatt et al. 1999). Our data suggest that a relatively diverse species assemblage of habitat-generalist small mammals inhabits fragmented riparian forests of northeastern Missouri. In agriculture-dominated areas, riparian forests may serve as refuges for forest-dependent species. Also, habitat- generalist small mammals may depend on these areas for year- round shelter while opportunistically using adjacent agriculture fields during times when crops are producing shelter and food (Cummings and Vessey 1994). The management of riparian areas to benefit water quality of associated water bodies and as wildlife habitat is a subject of great interest (Ice 1990). Originally, many riparian-forest management plans centered on preservation of existing forests or reestablish- ment of riparian vegetation (MDC 1986, Blinn and Kilgore 2001, USFS 2002), with a de-emphasis on active forest management (Bacon 1990). However, manipulative management of these forests could produce more diverse habitat for associated fauna, provide greater water-quality benefits (e.g., regenerating stands are likely to have a greater sediment- and pollutant-filtering capacity compared with mature stands), and potentially provide economic benefits to the landowner through timber sales (Bacon 1990, Blinn and Kilgore 2001). Responses of forest-floor small mammal species assemblages to silvicultural treatment are highly variable (Krull 1970, Kirkland 1977, 1990, Monthey and Soutiere 1985, Carey and Wilson 2001, Suzuki and Hayes 2003, Fantz and Renken 2005). Our work examined the effect of silvicultural management on a small mammal species assemblage within one of the largest blocks of riparian forest in northeastern Missouri. At this site it appeared that local-landscape factors, such as the linear and fragmented 496 Wildlife Society Bulletin * 34(2)</page><page sequence="13">makeup of the forest, resulted in a species assemblage dominated by habitat generalists. Castleberry et al. (2001) concluded that, even in the case of a habitat-specialist small mammal (Alleghany woodrat [Neotoma magister]), timber harvests may have less effect on the population than other factors (such as size of the mast crop) as long as intact forest areas are maintained as a component of the habitat. We suggest that, as long as forests are allowed to regenerate, blocks of mature forest are maintained, and other important factors (e.g., hydrology) are not altered, that silvicul- tural treatment in Midwestern riparian forests may not have a strong effect on forest-floor small mammal species assemblages or abundances, especially if those assemblages are dominated by habitat generalists. Although 2 common taxa appeared to have slightly decreased abundance in and adjacent to harvested areas, factors other than woody vegetation structure, such as weather and hydrology, may have played the largest roles in regulating short- term abundances within this species assemblage.

(Tony) Elliott (photo) is a resource staff scientist with the MDC. He received his B.S. in biology from Northeast Missouri State University (now Truman State University) and his M.S. in zoology and physiology from the University of Wyoming. He served as the field coordinator for the Riparian Ecosystem Assessment and Management (REAM) project from 2000 to 2004 and currently is transitioning into a position with MDC's Agricultural Systems field station. His research interests involve ecological relationships of a broad range of nongame wildlife within agriculturally dominated landscapes and effects of habitat manipulations on those organisms. He has been a member of The Wildlife Society since 2000. Brian Root currently is a senior fish and wildlife biologist (biomonitor) with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Carlsbad, California. During 1996-2005 he was a resource scientist for the MDC, where he was the REAM project coordinator. He received his Ph.D. and M.S. in wildlife science from the University of Missouri, Columbia, and his B.S. in wildlife management from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. His current work emphasis is to help develop long-term monitoring designs for large, multispecies habitat conservation plans in southern California. Associate Editor: Applegate.
