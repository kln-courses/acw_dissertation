Religious polemics and conflicts often occur because people fail to recognize the common core of the world's religions (encounters with the other of all socially constituted worlds) and that differences between religions stem from different historical and social faithful responses to these encounters. Heavily responsible for this cognitive failure are incoherent and unjustifiable metaphysical explanatory projects. Freed from metaphysics, each world religion mandates that people respect and cherish all other faithful religious responses and, in liberating people from suffering and into joyous living, these religions provide the motivation to obey this mandate and to creatively enter into dialogue with each other. Polemics rather than dialogue has become the standard practice for many people engaged in what is called "reli gious talk." Cultural wars, fed by the mass media's insatiable craving for ear shattering polemics, are waged between atheists and secularists on the one hand and "defenders of religious beliefs" on the other. Violent wars are waged between peoples trying polemically to use "religious talk" to legitimate claims to land and state power. Sectarian splits within established religious traditions get cemented into virtually irreconcil able differences because of polemics over literal vs. non-literal interpreta tions of religious texts.

These are presumptions which prevent people from seeing encounters with the infinite as the common core at the heart of the world's religions and from seeing different religions as socially constituted ways of responding to these encounters, different faithful responses which the common core requires be respected and cherished. In this essay, I will attempt to do three things: (1) Identify the com mon core at the heart of the world's religions. (2) Identify and critique the confused presumptions and their motivations which prevent so many people from focusing on this common core and which encourage them to engage in destructive polemics. (3) Show how encountering the infinite provides motivation for respecting and cherishing different religions and for entering into cross-religion dialogues which can strengthen creatively the fundamentals in each religion. THE COMMON CORE IN THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS By "encountering the infinite" I mean encountering the non-finite, the other to all socially constituted objects and subjects, the only kind of objects and subjects there are. Elsewhere I have presented the post-modern case that all objects of thought, speech, and experience, and all thinking, speaking, and experiencing subjects, are socially constituted.1 Words and concepts are social tools, and among the things we do using them, we talk and think about objects and events, and we experience such objects and events. Their use is constituted by our social practices of classification and individuation. People, who speak, think, and experience, are what they are because they have been socially trained to speak, think, and experience as they do. All objects and subjects, all linguistic, conceptual, symbolic, and experiential worlds are social all the way down. When I talk about the finite I am talking about such socially constituted objects and subjects. By encountering the infinite, I mean encountering the absence of the self-suf ficiency or exhaustiveness of the finite. I mean encountering that which is presupposed by the finite but which is not any being at all, not a socially constituted being and not some asocial and ahistorical being transcending our finite worlds. Encountering the infinite other of the finite is encoun tering the finite in a certain way. It is encountering it thankfully, joyfully, ethically, and trustingly. It is encountering it religiously. 26 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL.

That is the religious question. Scientism views such objects and our socially justified beliefs about such objects as self-sufficient and exhaustive, thereby denying itself the ability to see that its stance towards such objects is just another form of subjectivity. Pos tulations of a transcendent being, in order to give metaphysical, ultimate explanations, confusedly fails to recognize that this metaphysical God is just one more socially constituted object, feeding intellectual cravings and not faithful responses to the finite's other. Religious subjectivity views finite objects and our beliefs about them as historically and socially constituted and constrained, and thus not to be absolutized.

Religious subjectivity recognizes that people are never just biological or socially constituted crea tures. They are the ones constituting the finite worlds in which they dwell. Different vocabularies and different practices produce different worlds in which people live. In addition to their biological and social inheritances, people constitute themselves by living out some of the unlimited number of possibilities left open by their inheritance. Most importantly, in the case of people, "The ethical reality of the individual is the only reality."3 Building on Kierkegard's work, a host of twentieth-century thinkers have attempted to show why objectivistic modes of subjectivity exclude religious modes of life. Heidegger, in his attack on all ontotheologies, points out that one cannot pray to an ontotheological god; instead one must consider a god that lies beyond thinking,4 and one must consider a kind of thinking which is a thanking for the earth upon which all social worlds are built.5 Wittgenstein, who confesses that every question he investigated INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005 27</page><page sequence="4">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE was a religious question, writes that in addition to describing objects in the world one must show in one's way of life a non-verbal "mystical" stance toward the world as a "whole."6 He stresses that one must not attempt to reduce religious discourse expressing such stances to psychological, socio logical, or metaphysical objectivisitic discourse about objects.7 In his later writings, Derrida makes more and more explicit the religious motivation for his whole project of deconstructing all metaphysical claims about the presence of self-contained and self-sufficient meanings or objects, pointing out that everything finite and socially constituted points to an unrepresent able past and an infinitely open future.8 Religiously powerful developments of Derrida's thinking on religion have been written by Americans John D. Caputo9 and Mark Taylor.10 For all these thinkers, religious discourse about the infinite is not discourse about We encounter the any being about which one can have infinite When We objectivisitic beliefs, ethically encounter Other In order to see how religious people face tO face, discourse about the infinite does when we encounter ^ :a go?d place to,look is * - . . . the writings or Emmanuel L?vinas.11 them in that unique Levinas provides phenomenological Singularity that no analyses of five aspects of human descriptive categorizing life which involve encounters with Can bury Under SOCial that which is other than Husserl's SameneSS. conceivable objects and Heidegger's usable tools. First, analytically prior to our experience of objects, there is our encounter with the brute other ness of an environment we cannot escape, an encounter that fills us with the horror felt by children alone in a dark room, that sense of dread and fascination felt encountering the other of all socially constituted phenomena, which Rudolph Otto called the sense of the Holy.12 Second, there are our joyous, living encounters with the elements: drinking fresh water, walk ing and running, losing oneself in sunrises and sunsets. These encounters are the enjoyments, not yet controlled by conceptualizations, pointed to by the many myths of paradise. These encountered enjoyments are what Lacan calls the Real, the other to the symbolic realities we have constituted which always leave fractured our social worlds and which leave a void at the 28 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL.

These are the encounters pointed to in Utopian myths. Fourth, there are encounters with the possibility of our own death, the possibility of having no more possibilities. We cannot represent to ourselves our own death, because being dead means that we are not around to do any representing. Death, as the final limit of all possibilities, is not a possible event that one can experience or represent. Nevertheless, the possibility of having no more possibilities is something we continuously encounter existentially and it colors our ways of relating to the whole finite world. Fifth, and most decisively for L?vinas, we encounter the infinite when we ethically encounter other people face to face, when we encounter them in that unique singularity that no descriptive categorizing can bury under social sameness, and when we become At the COre O? the WOrld uniquely individuated by that unique religions are enCOUflterS set of responsibilities to the person With the infinite that encountered that can be transferred prohibit absolutizing to no one else Encountering other Qr worshiping anything people ethically is being bound to let ^ ^ jre ^ from them their biological life or for Compassionate and their ethical standing.

Encountering people in their primordial ethical suchness is being obligated not to treat them unjustly, dominating or oppressing them, and to resist unjust actions or practices, compassionately caring for them, especially if they are weak, powerless and vulnerable like orphans, widows, the disabled, the poor, and the needy stranger. At the core of the world religions are encounters with the infinite that prohibit absolutizing or worshiping anything finite, that require acting justly and opposing injustice, and that call for compassionate and loving care for all people. In Hinduism, neither Brahmin nor Atman are describable, finite them be in their singular uniqueness and not to murder them by acts of commission or omission, not to take ing justly and opposing injustice, and that call INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL.

Attaining moksa, the final goal of all the spiritual yogas, is recognizing that concern for one's very identity (an ethical identity) involves identifying with the (ethical) identities of all other people. Their responsibilities become my responsibilities. In Buddhism, all finite objects, subjects and events are recognized as resting on Sunyata, no-thingness, or Mu, the sky empty of all "ultimate" explanations. This recognition will permit one to cease those cravings for power and comparative self-worth that cause suffering and to begin compassionately letting all things be in their pre-socially constituted suchness. In Taoism, the harmonious way of nature is seen as an incarnation of the Tao that in principle cannot be named, and the tao (way) of living as a human is to live free of all alienation from the Tao, from nature, and from other people.

Christianity, God, indescribable with non-religious vocabularies, is only what Christians, in their resurrection faith, find their constituted Mes siah, savior, Christ, revealing him to be. Christians encounter their God as one who calls for Christians to exhibit agape, sacrificial love to all people. In Islam, Allah is never to be identified with anything finite, and Allah's message, communicated through Muhammad and the Qur'an, is to live righteously, praising Allah for his graciousness and mercy and obeying his injuntions to act justly and to care for the weak and needy. The core in these religions remains the same: encounters with the infi nite which prevent absolutizing the finite, and ethical mandates for justice and compassion. In seeking to faithfully respond to these encounters and mandates, different religious communities have constituted themselves in different ways. At the core of each, however, there remains the call not to confuse a specific form of faithful response with the infinite that is encoun tered. That would be worshiping a graven image. Also, at the core of each 30 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005</page><page sequence="7">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE religion is the mandate to respect ethically the unique individuals making up these communities of faithful respondents, the mandate to let them be in their original suchness and in their constituted religious identities. Between individuals in different religious communities, justice and compassion call for rejecting polemics and initiating dialogue that can creatively enrich each religious community's historically and socially unique way of responding faithfully to encounters with the infinite.14 CONFUSED RELIGIOUS PRESUMPTIONS Why then in "religious" talk in our current world is there so much polemics and so little dialogue? The answer lies in the fact that many scholars and intellectuals, who want to talk about religion, talk about the differences in beliefs that they think is the key to understanding what differentiates reli gions, in spite of the fact that encoun ters with the indescribable infinite is the yardstick religions use to measure the faithfulness of religious responses. It is an intellectualistic prejudice to presume that religious practices stem from religious beliefs, that a person's religious faith is a mat ter of that person's beliefs, and that religion fundamentally is a matter of subscribing to beliefs. Religious faith fulness, however, is what gives such beliefs their content and it is not the It is an intellectualistic prejudice to presume that religious practices stem from religious beliefs, that a person's religious faith is a matter of that person's beliefs, and that religion fundamentally is a mat ter of subscribing to beliefs. beliefs that generate the faithfulness of worship and obedience. According to such intellectuals, people in some religions believe that there is one god while those in other religions believe that there are many gods. This intellectualization of religion is apparent in the kinds of questions ordinary people ask when talking about religion. What do you believe? Do you belief that there is a God, a supreme being? Do you believe that there is a heaven or a hell? Do you believe that every thing written in the Bible or the Qur'an is true? Atheists don't believe there is a God. Agnostics are not sure. Critics of religion claim that all religious INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005 31</page><page sequence="8">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE beliefs are unjustified,15 and require certitude about ridiculous, foolish, grotesque, and dangerous creeds.16 When religions are described as sets of competing objectivistic claims about the existence or nature of certain beings or events, then people striving to maintain religious faithfulness to encounters with the infinite will also reject such religion. Of course, given the characterization in the last paragraph of religious encounters and responses, the irony is that these critics of "religious" beliefs are not really dealing with religion at all. With respect to the objects of such beliefs, all religious persons need to be atheists. Denying that religion has anything to do with objectivistic beliefs about beings is not denying that there are religious beliefs. These beliefs, however, are about religious beings and events socially constituted by worshiping and meditating communities respond ing faithfully to encounters with the infinite, worshiping communities with a certain kind of subjectivis itic mode of subjectivity.. They are beliefs framed by a Hebrew exodus faith, a Christian resurrection faith, or an Islamic Qur'an revelation faith. They are beliefs tied to a religious community's focusing of its worship and service on a Hindu god when engaged in bahki yoga, on a Boddhi sattva in Buddhist worship, on Lao Tzu in Taoist temple worship, on the God of the fathers in early Hebrew covenanting worship, on Yahweh by Moses and those he led out of Egypt and into a land flowing with spiritual milk and honey, on Jesus as the resurrected Christ whose spirit lives in his new body, the Christian community, or on Allah and the Qur'an when worshipfully reciting what was communicated through Muhammad. There are many reasons why beliefs expressive of a religious response to encounters with the non-finite other of the world of finite objects get tragically transformed into objectivistic beliefs about "supreme beings" or "miraculous" events. So much of people's modes of subjectivity today is objectivistic that it is very difficult not having one's religious discourse There are many reasons why beliefs expressive of a religious response to encounters with the non-finite other of the world of finite objects get tragically trans formed into objectivistic beliefs about "supreme beings" or "miraculous" events. 32 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005</page><page sequence="9">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE reduced to objectivistic talk. So much of our talk is non-religious talk about apples and oranges, shapes and sizes, countries and corporations ,that it is difficult not to turn religious beliefs into objectivistic beliefs about supernatural beings, forces, and events. Rather than using the language of creation to express our thankful, joyous acceptance of the elements with which we live, we end up talking about a powerful, supernatural being creating nature the way a potter creates a vase or a dancer creates a dance. Rather than just living faithfully in response to encounters with the infi nite, interpreting everything in terms of an exodus or resurrection faith, it is difficult not to construct a narrative of supernatural acts performed by a supernatural actor. All such talk, however, is human talk, governed by historical, social practices of classification, differentiation, and identifica tion. Religious beings can be beings socially constituted by communities responding faithfully to encounters with the infinite, but that which is other than all beings, religious or non-religious, cannot be another being. It does not help to say that one is only talking metaphorically or alle gorically when one is talking about supposedly supernatural beings. Using language metaphorically is drawing upon similarities between things. That which is other to all finite things can't be similar to finite things. Besides, one must already assume that it makes sense to talk about an infinite being in order to say that it is similar to finite beings. All beings, however, are socially constituted beings. The infinite other to such beings can't be an infinite being. Metaphorical talk fares no better, because point-by-point similarities can exist only if similarities can exist. Religious liberals are taking the wrong train when they think they can turn to metaphorical speech in order to remain religious while still rejecting the claims of "fundamental ists" that religious texts must be interpreted literally. The debate between religious liberals and literalists is grounded in confusion. Of course, one is to take religious texts literally. The question is, "What is the literal meaning of religious texts?" What is the form of life and lin guistic activities in which religious words are used? Religious texts are not non-religious scientific or historical texts. Neither are they metaphysical texts trying to talk about a supposed infinite, supernatural being and its "actions." "Fundamentalists" are correct when they say that religious texts are not to be dismissed because they are not secular texts. They are incorrect when they say that they are to be read as non-metaphorical descriptions INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005 33</page><page sequence="10">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE of supernatural beings and their actions. Such "fundamentalists" are not literalists because they do not let religious texts mean what they literally mean. In their speech they are not responding faithfully to encounters with the infinite, but they are making incoherent and unjustifiable metaphysical claims, giving into the craving to be intellectual masters of the world. To literally interpret religious discourse one must focus on how it occurs in prayerful, worshiping, meditative, obedient responses to encounters with the infinite. One of the main reasons that there is an intellectual tendency to inter pret different religions as different sets of beliefs, rather than different ways of responding faithfully to encounters with the infinite, is that religious beliefs get transformed into metaphysical beliefs. It is vital to religion's health, and to the absence of religous polemics and conflicts in our world, to understand that the infinite is not the metaphysician's god. Most defenders of atheism are defenders of the claim that the metaphysical god does not exist. Religious respondents to encounters with the infinite also have to be atheists of this sort. After two thousand years of sneaking in the back door and being invited in the front door, it is very difficult in the modern world to keep metaphysical contamination out of the temples of the world's religions. One hundred and fifty years ago, Nietzsche proclaimed that the metaphysical god, in all its scientistic, political, cultural, and metaphysical forms, is dead, but he warned that its rotting corpse still lies around infecting disastrously our ways of thinking and living. Given what the Buddha called our craving for metaphysical opinions, it seems that people have to be vaccinated again and again against the destructive viruses spread by the metaphysical corpse. Religious and social health requires that the metaphysical project be exposed for what it is: anti-religious, confused, unjustified, and dangerous. The metaphysical project does not give priority to responding faithfully to encounters with the non-finite. It gives priority to responding intellectu ally to the contingencies in life by constructing theories about how things It is vital to religion's health, and to the absence of religious polemics and conflicts in our world, to under stand that the infinite is not the metaphysician's god. 34 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005</page><page sequence="11">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE necessarily and timelessly are. It is an explanatory project and not a wor shiping project. It tries to give final explanatory answers to the questions: Why is every contingent thing as it is rather than otherwise and why do all contingent events occur as they do rather than otherwise? It attempts to answer these questions with a theory about ultimate reality, a theory about some necessary, infinite, unchanging being causing all contingent, finite, changing beings and events to be as they are. It is a rationalistic project which gives ultimate allegiance to a principle of sufficient reason which claims that there must be a reason why every possibility that is not actual remains a mere possibility. The metaphysical claim that there must be a reason for everything was seized upon by many religious thinkers, and religious responses of thanksgiving and hope were mutated into beliefs that there is a supernatural purpose for everything that exists and happens. Since the ancient Greeks, philosophy has defined itself as love of wis dom. This wisdom is an intellectual kind of wisdom. Aristotle claims that wisdom is knowledge of the ultimate reasons why everything is as it is and not otherwise.17 The religions of the world offer a different kind of wisdom. Their passion is not knowing what finite objects and events are like, when described in non-religious terms, or why they are as they are. The wisdom of the religious person is wise "know-how," knowing how to relate and respond to the finite objects and events in the world, how to construct a way of living that consists in a faithful response to encounters with what is other than such finite beings and events. Philosophy is born in wonder ing why things are as they are, but the wonder that thankful, religious people experience is over the wonderfulness of their own existence and their dependence upon elements which are the source of their most basic enjoyment. It is the wonder they experience when they encounter other people face to face, encounter them in their infinite, singular uniqueness and immeasurable ethical value and significance. Craving for philosophi cal wisdom is a craving to be an intellectual master over all things and it rules out the kind of surrender to the infinite that makes possible religious wonder and wisdom. The metaphysical god is as it must be in order for the metaphysical explanatory project to be carried out. The metaphysician is committed to a principle of sufficient reason which can only be satisfied if an eternal, infinite, necessarily existent, all-powerful, all-knowing, perfect agent acting INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005 35</page><page sequence="12">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE in the best possible way is postulated as the answer to the question why everything is as it is and not otherwise. Since all finite beings and events exist only contingently, giving final explanations for their existence and occurrence requires that their cause be a necessarily existent ultimate reality. Since sensory descriptions only apply to the finite and contingent, the only descriptions of this ultimate reality that are possible are the ones required by the principle of sufficient reason. The ultimate reason, the final cause, the final answer to the string of "Why?" questions, has to be something necessary, something for which there is no alternative possibility that has to be explained, something eternal and unchanging, an unmoved mover. Right at the beginning, therefore, the confusion endemic to the metaphysi cal project makes its appearance. There is no sense of necessity and no specifiable relationship between a supposed necessary being and contingent finite beings that will meet the demands of the principle of sufficient reason. The notion of physical necessity used by scientists in characterizing what is required by laws of nature won't meet the need for a final necessity because such laws might be different from the way they are. The notion of necessity used by logicians, who claim that certain propositions are necessarily true, won't meet the need because from logically necessary truths only logically neces sary propositions, and not contingent truths, can be deduced. In the case of the supposed necessity involved in saying that something is causally necessary for everything else and nothing is causally necessary for it, no such notion of cause is available. Since all events occurring in time occur only contingently and might not have happened, no event in time can be the ultimate cause. Science for centuries now has understood causality in terms of causal laws governing the occurrence of events in time. Such causal laws, however, are contingent. The law of gravity might have said that all bodies gravitate towards each directly proportional to the square of their The notion of necessity used by logicians, who claim that certain propo sitions are necessarily true, won't meet the need because from logi cally necessary truths only logically necessary propositions, and not contingent truths, can be deduced. 36 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005</page><page sequence="13">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE masses. One must go outside all sequences of events in time in order to postulate a metaphysical, ultimate cause. There is, however, no notion of a causal relation holding between a supposedly unchanging, non-finite being and all the finite beings and events in the world. It doesn't help to claim that the metaphysical god causes things to hap pen the way a human agent causes things to happen. The causal action of such a metaphysical god would have to be a timeless action required by the eternal nature of this agent. Human history would have to be swallowed up by this timeless act. To make this eternal agent the cause of everything is to say that only one agent is responsible for everything that happens. This generates all the problems tied up with notions of eternal predestination and the task of reconciling talk about human freedom and responsibility with this talk about the metaphysical god causing everything. If one takes seriously the claim that some metaphysicians/theologians make, that the unmoved mover causes space for freedom to exist, then either this "free dom" is a mere appearance (really the unmoved mover is causing things to happen) or free actions are not metaphysically explainable. Postulating an ultimate first agent generates the metaphysical/theological problem of suffering. If the metaphysical god causes everything, then this ultimate cause is responsible for suffering caused by tornados and cancer and by the people who are what they are and are behaving as they behave because of this one timeless act. The principle of sufficient reason is not satisfied by merely postulating a timeless agent. We still need to ask why such an agent created the finite world in time to be as it is. If the eternal agent were limited in knowledge about what things would be like after his causal act, then there would be a need to explain why there is such a limitation. The eternal agent must be infinitely unlimited in knowledge; it must be omniscient, knowing all possibilities and all actualities. Of course, this must be a kind of knowledge radically different from all forms of human knowledge. This agent cannot be changed by sensory input from finite objects. In one eternal "moment" this agent must know all past, present, and future events. Since this agent is unchanging, we can't say that what we do in any way affects or changes this metaphysical god. There is no response in it to human joy or suffer ing because responses are events occurring in time. Also, even though this god is said to be all knowing, we cannot say that it knows what we will INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005 37</page><page sequence="14">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE do before we do it or what the consequences of out actions will be before they happen. We have to say that this agent timelessly knows all events, just as it timelessly causes all events. One shouldn't say that the metaphysical god predestines everything, because the prefix "pre" suggests that the god knew before we acted what would happen. Locating such knowledge at a time before we act is to locate this god in time and thus to deny its eternal character. The metaphysician needs to say that its god, in its timeless act and knowledge, eternally destines everything to happen as it does. The principle of sufficient reason also requires that there be no limita tions on the ability and power of this agent to select which possibilities to make actual. The infinite, eternal, omniscient agent must be omnipotent. Again, problems arise when the metaphysician tries to specify how the word "power" works in the case of this infinite, eternal agent. In the science of motion, "power" is defined in terms of the time it takes to accelerate a mass through a specified distance, with such acceleration always being caused by another object acting upon it. The metaphysician's first cause, however, cannot be an object in space acting at a time. We can talk about people having the power to move things, the power to overcome obstacles, the power to get people angry, the power to think tilings through. All these exercises of agency power, however, are carried out by finite, embodied persons existing in space and time and act ing on beings likewise located in space and time. None of these notions of power carry over when talking about an unlimited, infinite, unembodied agent causing at one timeless moment all finite beings to exist and events to occur. There seems to be no difference between saying that everything happens as it happens and everything is caused to happen by an all know ing, all powerful eternal agent. Only by using anthropomorphic language to talk about this postulated ultimate cause does it seem to make sense to talk about action, knowledge, and power here. This is only an appearance of meaning, however, because we have no clue how to use such language to talk about this cause. Talk about a supposedly final and first cause of all contingencies, about a metaphysical god, is not religious talk. It is an intellectual substitute for the words of prayer and worship. 38 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005</page><page sequence="15">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE The metaphysician's god, were one possible, would have to be the way the principle of sufficient reason requires it to be. Using this principle to answer the question why everything is as it is requires that this god be described this way It is this intellectual project of seeking to give ultimate explanations that supplies the description of this supposedly ultimate answer to the philosopher's intellectual wondering. Talk about such a supposedly final and first cause of all contingencies, about such a metaphysical god, however, is not religious talk. It is an intellectual substitute for the words of prayer and worship. One can talk as a metaphysician without ever responding faithfully to encounters with the infinite. One can say that one believes in such a metaphysical god without passionate commitment to justice, respect for the indescribable singular uniqueness of people, and without responding in worship and prayer with thankfulness, contrition, and hope. Worship and prayer would be meaningless if such a metaphysical god existed. Everything simply would be as it must be, and even acts of worship and prayer would be eternally destined by the unmoved mover. The same holds for the meta physical project itself. The unmoved mover would be the cause of people believing in the unmoved mover. It is the metaphysician's commitment to the principle of sufficient reason and thus to his own intellectual practices of wondering and seeking ultimate explanations that is the ruling force in his life. The finite, human intellect is raised to the level of an ultimate, and it is just such a "Hegelian" deification of the finite that encounters with the infinite denounce as worship of idols. The incoherence in talk about a metaphysical god stems from the dependence of the metaphysical project on the principle of sufficient reason. Committing oneself to this principle is intellectually attempting to transcend the finite conditions which govern the use of the words "explain" and "real." In our ordinary use of the word "explain," explanations are needed only when anomalies appear, when we believe that situations are present which cannot be explained by our current general beliefs about how things happen. It is against a background of general beliefs that expectations are formed. When an anomaly appears that is not expected, then the ques tion "Why?" has work to do. The question is answered when background beliefs are modified so that the anomaly disappears and the unexpected now becomes the expected. The pragmatics of the human situation determine when explanations are needed and when they have been successfully given. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL.

All that is needed to explain events that need explaining is finding a general but contingent account of how finite things behave which for the time being leaves no unexplained anomalies. Attending to the pragmatics governing the use of the word "real" also shows that there is no need to postulate some ultimate reality. The word "real" has work to do only on those occasions when one wants to rule out the possibility that some describable thing is not real, is a fake, or imitation, or pretense, or phoney Saying that something is a real diamond is just say ing that it is a diamond, saying this in some context in which doubts have arisen about whether it is a diamond at all.

Part of the reason why the decaying corpse of the incoherent metaphysi cal god still is infecting people's understanding of religion and religious discourse is the fact that people are still claiming that there are proofs that such a god exists. Good religious hygiene, therefore, seems to call for showing again and again that these "proofs" are unsound. Looking at the three most popular "proofs" (the cosmological, ontological, and design arguments) might help in this "clean-up" job. The cosmological argument, offered by Aristotle18 and Aquinas,19 pur ports to prove that changes can be explained only if they are explained in 40 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL.

They claim that all motion needs a cause and that there cannot be an infinite series of such causes. If the word "motion" is taken to designate the motion of a physical object through space, then the argument is claiming that there cannot be an infinite series of such motions, with one motion causing the next. There has to be a first motion. This argument does not work. First, it is not rationally necessary that a series of past motions come to an end. If the present is numbered zero, then there could be an infinite series of negative numbers. Second, motion does not always need a causal explanation, as Newton's first law of motion points out. Bodies in motion stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. Third, a first motion in time would require an action in time, thus denying this being its required eternal status Aristode and Aquinas, in their proofs, did not focus on the motion of objects through space. For them, "motion" meant "growth," moving from potentiality to actuality the way an acorn grows to be an oak tree. They argued that ultimate explanations must be given for potentialities becoming actualities. For Aristotle, the whole world of contingencies is to be explained as striving to reach a certain final actual form, striving as if it were in love with the unmoved mover, the pure form which governs the whole process of growth in the finite world. Using this biological notion of motion, however, begs the question. It assumes that the finite world really is a world of potentialities seeking actuality and that such growth can only be explained in terms of an infinite, eternal un-growing grower. Contemporary biochemistry provides completely adequate explanations of why living things mature as they do. Furthermore, only if we assume that we could escape our finitude, and stand outside the world like a human god, could we know that the whole world is such an evolving organism moving from potentiality towards an eternally destined actuality. Hegel thought that metaphysicians could rationally reach such a transcendent position, that they could through reason actualize divine knowledge in themselves. It is just such self-deification that religiously faithful prophets like Kierkegaard denounced. The ontological argument fares no better than the cosmological argu ment. The best known versions of the argument are found in the writings of Anselm20 and Spinoza.21 This argument purports to demonstrate that the possibility of the existence of the metaphysical god is sufficient to guarantee INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005 41</page><page sequence="18">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE that this is not a mere possibility, but that this god actually exists. Anselm claims that if it is possible that there is a being describable as "greatest possible being," then necessarily it exists and it exists as a necessary and not a contingent being. It is not possible that this possibility be a mere possibility. This form of the ontological argument, however, faces serious difficulties. Usually when talking about something existing [protons exist], we are not describing what we claim exists. Rather we are saying that the word 'proton' can be correctly used to describe something. Saying that the greatest possible being exists is not like saying that protons have mass, and saying that it does not exist is not like saying that dragons are not ice cream bars. "Exists" is not a descriptive term and it cannot be part of the description "greatest possible being." It makes no sense to say that A is greater than because A exists and does not exist. Can "necessarily existent being" be such a descriptive term? It might mean "a being which is necessary for everything else and nothing is neces sary for its existence and thus nothing is sufficient for its non-existence." This is basically Spinoza's definition of substance, his metaphysical god. Spinoza claims that not only actuali ties need an explanation but also possibilities, which, when they remain mere possibilities, need a reason why they are not actual. Spinoza claims that since by definition, however, nothing could be a sufficient cause for the possibility of this substance not existing, it must exist. Why, however, accept Spinoza's version of the principle of sufficient reason? As we have seen, only some actualities need explanation, those that are unexpected anomalies given our background general beliefs. Why do un-actualized possibilities need an explanation for being mere possibilities. There is nothing strange about there being such mere possibilities. There are uncountable possibilities that remain mere possibilities. Spinoza's "proof begs the question. Only by assuming that everything, including all possibilities, is necessitated, and nothing is contingent, is his version of the principle of sufficient reason and the ontological argument acceptable. Of course, then this principle has no work to do because there are no mere possibilities to be explained; there Spinoza's ontological argument becomes the reductio ad absurdum of proofs for the existence of an ultimate cause of all contingencies. 42 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL.

Spinoza's ontological argument becomes the reductio ad absurdum of proofs for the existence of an ultimate cause of all contingencies. Design or ideological arguments were offered by Aristotle22 and William Paley,23 supposedly proving that the nature of finite objects can be explained only by postulating the existence of an eternal agent making them be the way they are. Aristotle's favorite example is our teeth, some designed for cutting and some for chewing. Paley sees the whole world, and its parts, such as eyes, as an intricate machine like a clock with carefully coordinated parts. Aristotle claims that only by postulating an unmoved mover moving the growth of teeth towards a destined end can this growth be explained. Otherwise one would have to say it just happened by chance or coincidence, which is highly unlikely. Paley also sees chance as the only alternative to postulating a maker producing things according to an intelligent design. The claims by Aristotle and Paley are both false. Whenever someone argues for a position by saying that it is the only alternative to sheer chance, one should suspect that this person has a very limited ability to think of alternative possibilities. Biochemistry and evolu tionary biology have provided well verified explanations.24 Besides, trying to construct a coherent idea of such a metaphysical designer would face all the problems pointed out already. The designer is timelessly eternal but the designed product is in time. Designing and producing the deigned object occur at a time but the designer never acts in time because it is eternal. An eternal design either pre-programs all the details or it cannot be used to explain why everything is as it is and not otherwise. Either human free dom and history, the heart and soul of religious concerns, get swallowed up by metaphysics or metaphysical explanations fail to give the explana tions promised. In spite of the incoherence of the theory, the scientific demonstration that it is not needed, and its threat to authentic religion, a huge service industry of Sunday morning preachers prosper by present ing constantly this discredited argument. The religiously faithful need to understand that their faithfulness in no way depends on believing in the soundness of this argument. Although the classical arguments for the existence of the metaphysical god are unsound, they can be interpreted as expressions of religious faith, once they are not taken to be talking about some supreme metaphysical INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL.

The ontological argument can be taken as the prayer Anselm offers it as, a prayer in which he acknowledges that only foolishness would lead one to say that the finite does not have an infinite other. The cosmologi cal argument can be interpreted as saying that conceivable finite beings always point to the non-finite that never can be conceptually captured. The teleological or design argument can be taken as saying that enjoying the elements, experiencing the awe some sublimity of nature, habitating interpersonally with others, ethically meeting people face to face, living on in one's cultural and ethical legacy, can exist only because of the infinite that is the atmosphere surrounding and penetrating everything finite. Many proponents of these arguments probably were motivated as much by their religious faithfulness as by the temptation to participate in the metaphysical theorizing practices so popular at various times in our history. ENCOUNTERING THE INFINITE AS A BASIS FOR DIALOGUE The metaphysical god is dead and, if the religiously faithful people of the world can understand this, then all the religions of the world will be liberated from a terrible burden that they have had to bear. They can be liberated from the metaphysical polemics which contribute so much to cultural wars. Religious creation talk, and the thankfulness and trust which generates it, can be freed from metaphysical creationism. The first, not being in the explanation business, is no competitor with evolutionary biology, and nei ther is the second, because it does not restrict itself to scientific standards of explanation. The religious mandate to universally respect the singularly unique ethical identity of all people can be freed from unjustifiable meta physical natural law theories which deny sexual and gender freedom by claiming that certain ways of gaining genital pleasure are unnatural. The Although the classical arguments for the exis tence of a metaphysical god are unsound, they can be interpreted as expressions of religious faith, once they are not taken to be talking about some supreme metaphysical being. 44 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL.

The religious prophetic tradition of warning about unrighteousness can be freed from the metaphysical claims about hells that generate so much painful fear, and the promised fruits of righ teousness can be freed from metaphysical claims about heavens that can motivate suicidal behavior which is often murderous. Freeing religion from metaphysics will liberate religion to exercise its spiritual power to enable people to resist causing violence, suffering, and injustice, and to provide people with the joyousness and happiness that enable people to love life and to continue to hope, even in the face of the chanciness of life that threatens to produce nihilistic despair. The world's religions universally proclaim that faithfully respond ing to encounters with the infinite delivers one from destructive modes of subjectivity and ushers one into ways of life filled with joy and signifi cance. Hinduism accents deliverance from being deceived into pursing as ultimate goals in life sensual plea sure, worldly power and success, or fulfilment of social mandates, goals which never can provide the identity, understanding, and bliss that we really want. Buddhism accents deliverance from the cravings for power and comparative self-worth that cause so much suffering to ourselves and others. Hinduism and Buddhism accent libera tion from enslavement to the social and cultural inheritance that nurtures in us illusory beliefs and desires, liberation from enslavement to bad karma.

Christianity accents liberation from the hopelessness and despair that suffering, worldly powerlessness, and death so often generate. Islam accents liberation from that unrighteousness that blind people to the gracious gift of life and the merciful gift of letting the past bury itself. In all of these religions, there is space for creatively enriching, through dialogue with other religions, their understanding of the human situation from which people need liberation. Religious liberation from the mess we have made of the project of human living is always tied in the world religions to liberation into joyous modes of living which make it possible for people to so love living that they can proclaim with Nietzsche, "Is that life? Well, let's do it again, even ifit is filled with all the chanciness of life we have just gone through." Hindu ism promises that people can be liberated to gain what they really want, moksa?life, understanding, and bliss that cannot be limited by our inescap able biological and social identities, knowledge, and pleasure. Buddhism promises that we can be liberated into a joyous, aesthetically magnificent nirvana style of life in which we and all other things are allowed to be in our primordial suchness. Taoism promises liberation into peaceful and blissful living in harmony with nature, other people, and our social inheritance. Judaism promises liberation into a world of spiritual milk and honey to be found in life in a community whose identity comes from worshiping and serving Yahweh, carrying out a mission of liberating people from slavery and injustice and into a life of faithfully responding to encounters with the infinite, a messianic world which is forever future no matter how fully realized it already is. Christianity promises liberation into a community of people resurrected from spiritual death into a living body filled with the spirit of their resurrected savior, their Christ, their messiah, a spirit of suffering, loving service aimed at empowering others to be liberated from powerlessness and hopelessness and into a life of finding eternal happiness in the very pursuit of eternal happiness that is found in their worship and loving service. Islam promises liberation into a paradise of righteousness found in joyfully praising Allah's graciousness and mercy. Again, all of these religions can enrich the worlds into which they liberate people by letting the other religions pour their riches into their own religious ways of life. Not only is there no reason for any of the world's religions to be at war with any of the other religions, but there is every reason for each of 46 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON WORLD PEACE VOL. XXII NO. 3 SEPTEMBER 2005</page><page sequence="23">ENCOUNTERS AND RESPONSES: SAMENESS AND DIFFERENCE them to respect and prize the others. The ethical core at the heart of each of them mandates that they respect the singular uniqueness of each person in every religion, and that means respecting their personal responses in faithfulness to their encounters with the infinite. That different religious communities of people have socially and personally constituted different ways of responding faithfully is only a reason for each religion to engage in dialogue so as to strengthen its form of faithfulness. (What is true of differ ences between world religions also applies, of course, to differences within any one of the religions.) That each religious tradition can profit from all the other religious traditions does not mean that religious homogeniza tion will or should occur. The very identity of religiously faithful people is a function of their religious historical and social inheritance. Respecting people means respecting who they are religiously and how they respond to their encounters with the infinite. Respecting people in their singular uniqueness also means respecting people who are not yet responding religiously in any way, not yet recog nizing the infinite that envelops them and the non-religious objects and events they are experiencing. Neither coercion nor polemics ever produces religious encounters or faithful responses. Religious faithfulness (in wor ship, meditation, self-criticism, respect, resistance to injustice, compas sionate service, joyous living, and hope), just might do what polemics and coercion cannot do.
