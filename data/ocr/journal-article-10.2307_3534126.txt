<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON THE CHlPMUNKS OF WEST-CENTRAL WASHINGTON EARL J. LARRISON Durirlg the past several years, the writer has been making a study of the chip- munks (Exta"ias) in certain parts of the state of Washington pursuant to an analysis of the relations of ecology to distribution and variation in mammals as revealed by several members of this genus. In the course of this investigation, a number of notes concerning the distribution, ecology, and habits of these animals have been obtained. The present paper summarizes some of this information as it relates to the three species and two subspecies of Eutarias that occur in west- central Washington-an area which may be considered as bounded on the west by Puget Sound, on the north by a line drawn from Everett to Pateros, on the east by the Columbia River, and on the south by a line drawn from Olympia to Priest Rapids on the Columbia. The biotic areas of this region have been described by the writer in a previous paper (Larrison, 1946). In spite of their abundance and engaging behavior, there is relatively little in the literature regarding the life histories of western chipmunks. Gordon's paper in 1943 ras a valuable contribution towaId remedying this situation. The writer hopes that the following notes may be of interest in regard to the chipmunks of a portion of \Vashington. Sagebrush Chipmunk (Eutarnias minitnus pictgs). This chipmunk is largely restricted to the sagebrush country (Columbian Prairie Belt: Sagebrush Section) of the eastern part of the region dealt with here. They are best represented in Kittitas and Yakima Counties, where records of occurrence are available from the Kittitas and Yakima Valleys and from the series of northwest-southeast ridges separating these valleys. Though specimens and records are few, their wide distri- bution seems to indicate that picts is scattered irregularly throughout much of the sagebrush-covered chaparral-like prairies of eastern Washington. Most of the indi- viduals seen b,v the writer were either climbing or perching in sagebrush bushes vvhere they appeared to be as much at home as on the ground. Burrows, easily dug in the soft volcanic soil, were found at the base of the bushes. A rancher on Reeser Creek, northwest of Ellensburg, K;ttitas County, told the writer in September 1944 that these chipmunks were common in that area, occurring not only in the sage- brush, but also in the antelope brush (Pl,zrshia tridentata), which was much more abundant than the former plant in that place. These chipmunks are probably not so common as formerly, due to changes in the natural habitat that have occurred during man's occupation of the region. A large portion of the more level areas have been cultivated and now support fruit orchards, grain and potato fields, and a few other crops ecological conditions vastly diSerent from the original type. Only those places above the reach of irrigation still retain the primeval ecology. However, even these areas have been considerably altered by fires and extensive spring sheep grazing. The Reeser Creek informant previously mentioned stated that in clearing a half-acre piece of land of antelope brush for cultivation the previous spring, he had killed several sagebrush chipmunks having burrows in the field. According to him, the animals usually burrow in the earth near the stems of bushes, and they appear (23)</page><page sequence="2">24 THE MURRELET Yol. 28 (2) early in the spring and disappear in September. None were seen by the writer in an examination of this area during a visit on the third week end of September 1944, nor in the Naches (Yakima County) area during late September in 1940. Along lower Reeser Creek the sagebrush chipmunks are said to frequent the grain fields adjacent to natural areas in the late summer when the grain is ripe. This factor may account for the more than usual abtlndance of these animals in this place. I)uring the afternoon of C)ctober 10, 1945, the writer saw one dart across the Ellensburg-Vantage highway near a turreted hill known locally as the "Chinaman's Hat' and disappear into a boulder-reinforced fence corner. There are no cultivated fields in this vicinity and the natural vegetation is quite sparse, the immediate area being rather barren and wind-swept. Prolonged lip-squeaking by both the writer and his companion a performance usually promptly investigated by chipmunks of other species-failed to bring forth this individual from his retreat. This incident illustrates well the seemingly innate shyness of E. "inintus pictus. Columbian Chipmunk (Eutvtnias aÂœnoe^&amp;us affinis). The range of this chipmunk in the region concerned in this paper is largely coincident with that of the yellow pine (Pinus ponderos) belt (Montane Forest Belt: Yellow Pine Section) on the lower east slopes of the Cascade Range. This ecological zone penetrates into the mountain range to the west through the Naches, Yakima, Wenatchee, and Entiat Rivers and straggles out into the Columbian Prairie Belt in the form of irregular pine groves on the north-facing slopes of the ridges separated by the various rivers. To the east, the range of affinis is well marked, since the chipmunk seldom ven- tures out onto the prairie beyond the straggling fringes of pines. Indeed, the writer found them almost as common in such forest outposts as in the center of the range- the open treeless habitats, however, being strictly shunned. The western border of the range, on the other hand, is not as well definedv While, in general, these chip- munks usually prefer the open pine forests, they also invade the semi-open mixed pinen larch, and fir forests (Montane Forest Belt: Pine-larch-fir Section) on the higher sIopes to the west. Here, however, they are less common. This infiItration of the pine-Iarch-fir area, particularly along the upper Naches River, brings them in contact with the range of Eutamias agoenus lledibundus, resulting in a belt of intergradation. Specimens from Mount Aix, Yakima County, for example, are almost equally intermediate between affinis and ludibundus. For the most part, however, the ranges of these two races are separate, the Naches R;ver breach appar- ently being the most important connection in the central Cascades. Though the yellow pine forests are quite open and contain very little under- brush, the gradual deposition in piles of the branches from mature pine trees, as well as occasional wind-thrown trees, in an arid decay-inhibiting climate furnishes adequate cover for these chipmunks. Rocky outcroppings are also home to many families. The burrows of mantled ground squirrels (Citellgs lateralis saturatus) located at the bases of trees and stumps are frequently used. At Rocky Flat Yakima County, the writer also found a few chipmunks emerging from-burrows made and occupied by the somewhat similarly sized Microtgs longicaudgs. An abundant food supply is garnered from the flowers, grasses, and small shrubs of the forest floor as well as from the pine cones cut down by pirle squirrels (Tatniasci"rus doHglasi). The writer found Columbian chipmunks, as well as a number of other members of the Sciuridae, very common at Rocky Flat where during the August and September harvest season, each pile of branches fairly</page><page sequence="3">May-August, 1947 CHIPMUNKS OF WEST-CENTRAL WASHINGTON 25 swarmed with affinis. It should be noted that in this area the pine forest is inter- rupted by a number of park-like prairies or flats. Chipmunks were rarely found to venture very far out on these open pIaces from the brush piles, stumps, or the forest into which, should danger threaten, they could find haven after a few sec- onds' excited scramble. From the viewpoint of the casual visitor, the Columbian little chipmunk is prob- ably the mammal most familiar and frequently met in the yellow pine forest on the eastern slopes of the Cascades in Washington. In their typical haunts in the open woods, these chipmunks become very abundant. As is characteristic of the species noenus, affinis has a bright vivacious dispo- sition. This contrasts strongly with the "personality" of E"tamias townsendii. A possible explanation for the greater activity evidenced in amoenus may be the com- parative openness of the environment in which they live. While it is true that this chipmunk spends most of its time in and around such places of potential haven as brush piles and logs, individuals often find it necessary to cross open spaces where there is usually no cover available for some distance. Rapid locomotion and general alertness would thus appear more urgent for an amoenus than for an individual of Eutaias townsendii, for example, as it forages in the comparative safety of a hazel and salal thicket. The smaller body size may likewise be an additional adaptation to the more open environment. Chipmunk enemies are possibly more numerous in both species and individuals in the open areas than in the dense forests. The diurnal pygmy owls, the weasels, coyotes, and accipitrine ha^ks are possibly the most important rodent predators in the pine woods. Along with greater activity, the anmoen?s chipmunk is much more vociferous than are members of the townsendii group. By way of explanation and at the risk of becoming anthropomorphic, we may state here that chipmunk vocalizations seem to be roughly divided into three categories. Using affinis as an example (there appears to be little if any difference between notes of affinis and ludibgndus), we may list the first group as containing the general call or recognition notes. These are given at more or less regular intervals when danger is not threatening. They prob- ably serve as general identification signals and may be of significance in designating territories. Such a sound is a soft thrush-like zerhoit, given in a slow unhurried tempo with relatively little carrying power. The second type may be called the "danger signal." This is a rapidly uttered high-pitched whtz . . . whtz . . . zuhtz, given with much insistence and concern. These notes usually have an upward or downward inflection, depending on whether the danger is more or less imminent. The third tpye of note consists of the indescribable chittering uttered when the animal is suddenly and unexpectedly surprised or hotly pursued. It is interesting to note that Miller (1944 :88) lists a similar classification of notes in certain California species. At Rocky Flat, in August 1941, the writer found over half of the specimens col- lected to be infested with warble fly (Cuterebra) grubs. Usually located on the back, sides, or belly, the larvae were sometimes almost three-fourths of an inch long and made considerable swellings, often communicating to the exterior through open pores. Some chipmunks had as many as four or five "warbles," a condition which must have seriously inconvenienced the animal. A few specimens were also infested with wood ticks, and all had fleas. The Rocky Flat anoenus were the most heavily infested with ecto- and sub-cutaneous parasites of all the chipmunks collected in the study.</page><page sequence="4">26 THE MURRELET Vo1. 28 (2) E. a. afinis is actively abroad from early spring to the first fall of snow. At Rocky Flat in 1942, only a few individuals were out in early May, though this con- dition may have been caused by tlle snowy weather during the visit. The chipmunks were found to be most active in September and October. As is the case with tlle other varieties of Etcllxias studiedS affirlis is strictly diurnal. Individuals were rarely seen till the sun arose, and all had disappeared well before the twilight shadows of early evening. Few were observed during the heat of midday, however. Hollister's Chipmunk (Eutamias amoenus ludibundus). This chipmunk is found from north to south across the region here concerned. It occurs in the open situa- tions above the dense montane forests along the crests of the Cascades and in the extensive alpine areas on the lower slopes of Mount Rainier. Apparently this race is quite strictly limitecl to the "ecological islandsn'- the form in which most of the alpine country occurs along the main summit line of the range. It does not commonly penetrate the dense montane forests bordering the lower edges of the Sub-alpine Section of the Alpine BeIt or the open rocky fields of the Barren-alpine Section. Since the montane forests of the western slopes of the range overlap the crest-line and drop down the eastern slopes a short clistance, a general intermingling of this race with the neighboring clginis through tlle somewhat irregularly open Pine- larch-fir Section of the Paltlsian A1ontane Belt is prevented. In a few placess however, notably just east of Mount Rainier in a somewhat less humid area formed by a small precipitation shadowS ludibundlss comes in contact with aginis. Apparently, however, an open-habitat bridge is not always necessary for travel in chipmunks. For example, a small clearing on lower Goat Creek, Pierce Courlty, separated by more than a mile of dense hemlock forest from the nearest alpine areas, supports a small colony of Hollister's chipmunks and mantled ground squirrels. After considerable examination, the writer was unable to find any wnoenus in the intervening forest. Such cases lend strength to the hypothesis that there may be indixidual variation in inherited habitat preferences as well as in other animal char- acters. To investigate this further, the writer trapped out the ltbdibund;Zfs colony on Goat Creek. Two years later, tM70 pairs had taken up residence in the area. A similar experiment with identical results, was performed on the mantled ground squirrels at this place. FIollisters chipmunk typically prefers the open brushy habitats in the Sub- alpine and Intermediate-alpine Sections of the Alpine Belt. Its ecological prefer- ences are similar to those of affinis, though of course the vegetatirre species involved are different. The center of abundance seems to be in the brushy Sub-alpine Section. In Cold Basin on Morse Creek near Gold Hille Yakima County, these chipmunks were common in the yellow cedar-pine-aspen-willow brush on the floor as well as in the Cecznot/us chaparral on the north side of the basin. Burned areas are favored spots. The two large burns at Snag Basin near Corral Pass and on the upper Silver Creek (Pierce County) contain many of these chipmunks. The writer rarely saw ludibundus above the ground in bushes or trees although Taylor and Shaw (1927: 95) state that they saw individuals occasionally to heights of more than Sfty feet and apparently considered them to be more arboreal than the Cooper's chipmunk. Hollisters chipmunks are very common in the lower alpine reaches on Mount Rainier, especially in the camping and picnicking areas where an abundance of table scraps and nuts is always available during the summer.</page><page sequence="5">May-August, 1947 CHIPMUNKS OF WEST-CENTRAL WASHINGTON 27 That foraging activities during the autumn harvest season may take ltldibundus individuals into open areas above their usual haunts was indicated on a visit by the writer to Burroughs Mountain, Mount Rainier National Park, on September 23, 1945. A sudden early storm had occurred the previous night, covering the surface with half a foot of fluffy snow. The sides and plateau-like top of Burroughs Moun- tain were criss-crossed with chipmunk trails punctuated with numerous small exca- vations to the seed pods of dried alpine plants. Many individuals were seen busily digging in the snow and gathering seeds. Evidently the early storm had come before the animals considered their stores complete. The writer has never seen more than a very few chipmunks in this area earlier in the summer. Several pairs, however, maintain residence in the loose rock foundations of the two rest houses on the summit of Burroughs Mountain. Individuals were active around these places on the aforementioned September day. A weasel, possibly at- tracted by the little colony, was later seen to enter one of the houses. Evidently, some chipmunks wander to much higher elevations, as is indicated by the record of a ludibundus seen on the summit of Mount Rainier (over 14,000 feet elevation) on August 15, 1919, more than 7,000 feet above timber line (Taylor and Shaw, 1927:98). Like aginis of the pine woods to the east, ludib?ndus is a common resident and the characteristic diurnal mammal of its chosen range the open alpine forests of the high mountainous areas. The writer found Gold Basin mentioned above to be an ideal haunt for these chipmunks. The abundance of chaparral and huckleberry brush and the protection of the basin and a sunny exposure have encouraged the development of a large colony here. E. a. Iudibundus is very similar to affinis in activity, disposition, and voice. Weasels and other carnivores may take a few of these animals, while in the air the pygmy owl and the accipitrine hawks are ever searching for small rodent life. Many times in the "high country" the writer's attention has been first attracted to a hawk by the excited whtz of some chipmunk or the sharp tsick of a mantled ground squirrel. In September 1941, for instance, while Bob Fussner and the writer were skinning specimens at Gvld Basin, in the clearing before the camp a number of chip- munks and ground squirrels were running about. Several birds were singing in near-by clumps of yellow cedar. Suddenly the sharp note of a chipmunk ras heard, and we looked up to see a large dark goshawk glide swiftly across the clearing. \Yhere there had been several animals and considerable activity a few seconds before, all was now silent and apparently deserted. However, closer inspection of the barren patch of ground immediately before us revealed several chipmunks flat- tened out on the surface quite motionless. A short time later, after the hawk had disappeared, the activity of the animals uras resumed, though in an apparently more watchful mood. Chipmunks of this race garner their food supply from the berries and seeds of the huckleberries, grass, and flowers which are so abundant in the Sub-alpine and Intermediate-alpine Sections. The storing habits of these animals were well illus- trated one afternoon in September 1940, when the writer was picnicking at the campground at Yakima Park, Mount Rainier. Readily accepting the small bits of cantaloupe oSered them, the chipmunks would carry the morsels a short distance away, deposit them in a shallow hole in the pumice soil, cover the hole with a little soil hastily scooped up, and immediately return for more. No doubt many of these caches are forgotten and never used, at least by the individual originally making them.</page><page sequence="6">28 THE MURRELET Vol. 28 (2) The chipmunk is in hibernation while the ground is covered with deep snow from late October to May or June. A number of individuals appear irregularly during the late spring, however. Townsend's Chipmunk (Eutamias townsendiÂ« townsendii). The Townsend's chipmunk occurs throughout that portion of the Puget Sound Lowland Belt within the boundaries of the region here concerned wherever suitable habitats are available. To the west, the transect range is limited by the waters of Puget Sound though there are records from Bainbridge and Vashon Islands. The eastern limit of the range coincides with the border of the Puget Sound Lowland Belt at the foot of the Cascade Mountains. The lowland race meets the mountain race along this line, and intergradation freely takes place. Skins clearly showing such a condition have been examined from North Bend and Salal Prairie and from Greenwater River and the Dalles of the White River. Originally the Puget Sound Lowland Belt was densely forested with Douglas fir and red cedar, and the ecology of townsendii was probably quite similar to that of cooperi of the hemlock forests on the near-by mountains. However, during the past eighty or ninety years, the invasion of human civilization has largely destroyed much of the forests of the Lowland Belt, so that examples of this belt in its primeval state are quite rare. Most areas forested at present are of second growth with a con- glomerate of plant species. E. t. tozunsendii has been greatly reduced in numbers, according to the reports of several long-time residents to whom the writer has talked, and has been forced to take to the scattered woodlots and second-growth areas through much of its range in the belt. In these places, it is most often found in brush in clearings, piles of fallen logs, and on the edges of wooded patches. This chipmunk, though occurring throughout the Puget Lowland Belt of west- central Washington, is not nearly so often seen as are members of the species awloengs in the Cascade Mountains. Thus the pine squirrel, not the chipmunk, is probably the most frequently encountered diurnal mammal in this region. The probable reasons for infrequency of observation of this chipmunk are several. First, it appears that townsendii chipmunks are not nearly so numerous as are the arnoen?&gt;s. This may be largely due to the ecological changes that have taken place in the Puget Lowland Belt and the absence of forced concentration in suitable habitats that accounts for the local abundance of the latter species. Townsend's chipmunk is a shy creature preferring the relative safety of dense brush and only occasionally venturing out into the open. In its typical environment, of course, openings are scarce and the chipmunk must by necessity be a deep-woods dweller. The opening of much of the original habitat will offer this chipmunk the opportunity to live a less secluded existence. Whether it will make this adaptation only the future will tell. The mild climate, many months of congenial weather, and the abundance of cover may account for the lesser activity and vivaciousness of townsendii. Certainly chipmunk life see1ws easier in the lowlands than in the alpine areas. Predators are probably less numerous and burrows at the bases of trees and in fallen logs are close at hand. Alpine abundance of Extamias, however, may indicate that optimum conditions for these animals actually occur there. E. townsendix is not nearly so vocal as E. amoenus. The general call or recogni- tion note is a soft chuck . . . chuck . . . chxck . . . chuck) given slowly. The danger or warning note is a sharp kzeriss, its inflection depending on the imminence of the disturbance. These notes usually accompany the intruder as he passes through the</page><page sequence="7">May-August, 1947 CHIPMUNKS OF WEST-CENTRAL WASHINGTON 29 forest. The writer has more than once detected the approach of an unseen person or animal by means of these signals. Bailey (1936:127), on the authority of J. K. Townsend, states that the Chinook Indians called this chipmunk "Quis-quis." The terror notes are sharp irregular chippers. Food is comparatively abundant in the Puget Sound Lowland Belt. Chipmunks have been found to feed on nuts, berries, seeds, fruits, insects, grains, bulbs, roots, and green foliage. They often climb to heights of forty to sixty feet to obtain seeds in the cones of firs and hemlocks. Hazel nuts are much sought after, and scarcely a hazel bush is left untouched when the nuts are ripe. Townsend's chipmunks are active from early March to November, and some- times a few are seen abroad on warm sunny days during the winter. In place of true hibernation, these chipmunks appear to indulge in a deep sleep brought about by an enforced restriction to shelter during inclement weather. Cooper's Chipmunk (Eutamias townsendii cooperi). Cooper's chipmunk is the characteristic member of the genus in the dense hemlock forests of the Oregonian Montane Forest Belt in west-central Washington. Westerly, it occupies the montane forests to the base of the Cascades where it meets and intergrades with the Town- send's chipmunk of the Puget Sound Lowland Belt. To the east, cooperi is limited by the open forests of the Yellow Pine Section (Palusian Montane Forest Belt) into which it seldom penetrates. It is likewise rarely found in the Alpine Belt islands occurring along the crest of the Cascades through its range. Specimen records and observations show that cooperi occurs throughout the Montane Forest Belt (except- ing the Yellow Pine Section) of the region treated in this paper wherever suitable habitats are available. Like its lowland relative townsendii, cooperi is a shy inobtrusive chipmunk, most frequently seen in slightly more open places in the hemlock forests of the Oregonian Biotic Province and in the mixed forests of the Pine-larch-fir Section of the Palusian Province-. A pile of fallen logs, a windfall, or a growth of alders and willows along a stream are favorite habitats, the first being perhaps the most desir- able- as fallen logs are a preferred route of travel. Traps set on logs by streams rarely failed to produce specimens. Open forests usually do not appeal to these chip- munks, and at Gold Basin and Rocky Flat the writer found them in the dense timber up to its border with the open forest (sub-alpine and yellow pine areas, respec- tively), but rarely beyond. Like townsendii, cooperi frequently ascends bushes and small trees to forage. At Gold Basin, one was shot down from a height of about sixty feet in a pine tree where it had been feeding. When considering the difference in climbing habits of E. townsendii and E. aoenus, it must be remembered that in the areas occupied by the atnoengs group, food is much more readily obtained on or relatively near the ground than in the ranges of the townsendii races, where recourse must be made more often to berries, nuts, and seeds in bushes and trees. This chipmunk is the only member of the genus occurring in the dense forests of the Cascade Mountains, where it occupies an ecological position corresponding to the forest-dwelling E. t. townsendii of the Puget Sound Basin. In the mountains, the cooperi chipmunks seem to shun the deepest portions of the woods and tend to congregate in the more open clearings and brush along streams scattered through the forest, where they are often locally common. In disposition, cooperi is similar to townsendii. There also seem to be no difTer- ences in voice between the two races.</page><page sequence="8">30 THE MURRELET Vol. 28 (2) At Goat Creek, near the northeastern corner of Mount Rainier National Park, the writer had opportunity to study these chipmunks for rather extended periods. In the vicinity of the camp, the chipmunks were usually found in and around a tumbled pile of logs ill a small cIearing and on tlle logs in and along the creek. In these places the animals apEreared to be most active shortly after dawn and in the late afternoon. Since twilight comes early in the mountain forests, few chipmunks nvere stilI abroad by six o'clock in the summer. Individuals regularly visited the cabins in the Goat Creek-Silver Creek recreational areas. Thc)ugh seldom in evidence on Sundays, they carefully inspected the yards and porches of the cabins the follow- ing day for rhat food scraps the Sunday visitor had left. In such areas the chip- munl&lt;'s greatest enemy is the dog and in places where such pets are kept the chip- munk is absent. The chipmurlk was obsel^ved to be most active during the harvest season in late surIlmer. Berries, seeds, roots, bulbs vegetationS and insects make up the chief items of food for this species. Chipmunks are not in evidence during rainy periods, but zvhen the storms are over and the vvoods are steaming in the sunshineS they often scamper about in seeming exuberance. One time in September 1940 no chipmunks were seen all day around the cabin while a drizzling rain was falling. Late in the afternoon, however the sun came out and a number of chipmunks uTere soon runninb about in the clearing. The writer put out six tin-can live traps and all were filled within a short time. One trap was placed at the base of a large hemlock hile a chipmunk clung to the trunk about twenty feet above, watching the whole procedure. When the writer moved a short distance away to watch, the animal descended the tree, entered the trap, and was promptly caught. At Goat Creek, the chipmunks lived in burrows at the bases of trees and beneath buildings. Throughout the cabin area, the woodsheds were favorite abodes. Pygmy owlsS accipitrine hawks, and weasels probably constitute the chief natural enemy of this chipmunk. Because of its montane distributiorl, cooperi has a shorter season of activity than the lowland race. A more complete hibernation may take Elace. I:)isappearing in early November they do not usually appear in numbers until April or May, when the snosnr melts. Some individuaIs may te encotlntered earlier in the spring, however.
