(Moma at Heide, Melbourne, 1998, The Modern Institute, Glasgow) CHARLES ESCHE MTI UNDOMESTICA TING MODERNISM Modernist art is meant to be difficult. It was intended to shock, to stir up passions and outrage bourgeois values. It achieved much of that ambition, but where could it go? The audience became dulled to shock tactics and, ultimately, even the most conservative of institutions valued the frisson of transgression that 'modern art' could provide. For artists, the past thirty years has allowed a gradual reassessment of the impact and purpose of modernist ideology. Much work has been a critical evaluation of its successes and failures, post-modernism being in most cases a response to, rather than a break with, modernism itself. Coming late to the field of modernist critique, the work of Simon Starling occupies a fascinating position. Perhaps sitting on the cusp of a redefinition of value systems, it looks back with sympathy and knowledge at the work of the early twentieth century, while allowing the audience sight of its failure. His contribution is also peculiarly reflective of modernism's history in Britain, or perhaps more accurately, England. In England, the exception in Europe, modernism was not the defining cultural moment of the twentieth century. Instead it remained for much of the period a type of optional extra, occasionally applied to foreign-designed architecture or to art from the rural idyll of St Ives, but never securely anchored in the metropolitan heart. It is certainly not without reason that artists such as John Piper and Paul 90 Nash sought to define the particular qualities of English art in relation to</page><page sequence="4">historical models of Anglo-Saxon culture or its relationship to landscape and countryside. They wanted to maintain a sense of continuity that separated English history from the rest of Europe while ascribing some European developments to English influence. In 1936, John Piper wrote about the relationship between contemporary artists and the monumental sculptors of Anglo-Saxon and Romanesque England. 'The purely non-figurative artists of some early Northumbrian and Cornish crosses were the forebears of the pure abstractionists of today. There were also early reactions against recognised forms that find a contemporary parallel in Surrealism ... The local type of carving to be seen on the font at Toller Fratrum, Dorset ... has the bigness and strangeness that has been accessory to so much of the achievement of Picasso, and through him and others to the aesthetic revelations of the twentieth century.' In Nash's writings, as Judith Collins points out, 'he appeared to be reclaiming his heritage, a mix of formal abstraction and Surrealism from Neolithic and Saxon times and using it to forge new work'.1 Piper, Nash and their comrades tried in such texts to establish an indigenous modern art that was sprung from the soil of England rather than imported from the 'continent'. In doing so, they removed a large part of the radical political and social content from European modernism while retrieving the aesthetic innovations. To fill the gap, these aesthetics were then accompanied by an historicist manifesto of the always existing English genius loci. In this process, modernism became domesticated, in the sense that it found a place both in English history and in its parlour. Jim Ede's quirky but intriguing collection of Ben Nicholsons, Barbara Hepworths, stones and seaside bric-a-brac at Kettle's Yard in Cambridge is perhaps the archetypal demonstration of the specific ambitions of English modern art of the mid-century. Ede's model went on to influence British design from Terence Conran to John and Sunday Reed, whose Australian home serves as the heart of the Museum of Modern Art at Heide, Melbourne and became the departure point for Le Jardin Suspendu by Simon Starling. Le Jardin Suspendu draws an extraordinary lateral strand of connection from this little piece of English modernism in the Australian suburbs to Le Corbusier, to the explorer Vita Alsar and to aboriginal boat-builders. In the garden of their newly built house, the Reeds constructed an arboretum of European and American trees, reminders of another place and culture. A few indigenous trees already existed on the site and these were incorporated into the plan. (One bears an ancient canoe shaped scar in its trunk, evidence of a much earlier occupation of the land.) From this unlikely juxtaposition of international-style architecture and aboriginal technology, the piece springs into life in a series of baroque, imaginative steps. Attempting to find common ground between tree and house, Starling first investigates the origins of modernist architecture through Le Corbusier and the inspiration he found in the structure of 'flying machines' as models for his proposed 'machines for living'. Modelling, both in an intellectual and physical sense, becomes the symbolic architecture for Le Jardin Suspendu as Starling then travels to Quayaquil in Ecuador to source a balsa wood tree with which to build a working model of a 1920's French-built Farman Mosquito. Balsa, the main material used by model builders, is predominantly sourced in Ecuador where it has a major role in the economy. Quayaquil is also significant to the project as the point of departure for the explorer Vita Alsar's 8565-mile journey from South America to Australia to 'prove' that the populations of the two continents were related. The work then travels further as a section of the selected tree was then 91 shipped to Glasgow where Starling set about building the Mosquito replica. Once</page><page sequence="5">SIMON STARLING built, the model was test flown and then sent to Australia to be shown on a glass table underneath which the tools and materials needed to complete the model's construction were gathered. Here, production, presentation, adventure and theory were all bound together in the final display. Le Jardin Suspendu, a phrase used by modernist architects to describe a flat-roof garden, succeeds in reaffirming something of the Utopian ambitions of early modernism, an ambition apparent as much in Vita Alsar's voyage as in Le Corbusier's radical texts. To see Starling's work we, as viewers, have to understand the extent to which history is both available for us to use and places limits on our actions and understanding. The work knowingly undomesticates the modernism of Jim Ede and the Reeds, replacing their references to the natural world with the contribution of individual human beings, whether European or indigenous Australian, whose work has and can make a difference to our perceptions of culture. However, this contribution, once established, is instantly undermined again. The work is placed back into the house or gallery in the final event, wistfully looking out of a window at the ancient canoe tree standing in the contemporary Heide garden.1 In this way, the piece acknowledges in a very compassionate way our current ambivalence towards the modernist adventure as one that retains some of its almost unbearable optimism while being apparently mummified by the museum and made inaccessible to our current ideologies. The metaphor of travel and the oscillation between the natural world and cultural perceptions of order is emphasised further in Starling's work for the Galerie f?r Zeitgen?ssiche Kunst, Leipzig. H.C/H.G.W relates C.F.A. Voysey, the Arts and Crafts movement designer and architect, to the specific location and atmosphere of the Leipzig villa where the gallery is based. Voysey designed a 'swan chair' in the 1880s by adapting the graceful form of the bird for the profile of the legs and back, terminating in a stylised swan's head. Examples of this use of animal motif are common in Arts and Crafts design as a way of retaining some link to high Victorianism while suggesting new aesthetic possibilities - another way in which English experimentation was always keen to express a measure of continuity. In Germany, the same period saw more radical attempts to break with the past, but bourgeois taste remained fairly conservative throughout the 1890s. The Leipzig villa built for the geologist Hermann Credner is a classic typical of its kind, but it was built at an obtuse angle to Karl-Tauchnitz Stra?e in order to preserve an ancient oak tree which occupied the plot. This tree was finally removed during the conversion of the building into a gallery, leaving the villa in an inexplicable relation to the street and a series of tree trunk sections scattered around the grounds. This peculiarity created the beginning of Starling's narrative, as the trunk of the oak became the material for the remaking of Voysey's chair. The chair itself is presented looking out on the remains of the trunk, the only window in the gallery left uncovered. As with Le Jardin Suspendu, there remains a strong presence of the production process as the clamps and other apparatus are left attached to the finished chair. This technique both invests the chair with a contemporary presence and gives it a strange technical addition that suggests some function for the chair other than a simple support for writing. When we are made aware that Voysey was commissioned by H.G. Wells to design a house to be built with money generated by the sales of The Time Machine, the narrative begins to gather pace. This new copy of an old design, made of an even older tree and placed in a renovated building, in a city remaking itself in the wake of the collapse of the DDR, contains the seeds of a viruently expansive set of displacements in 92 time and space. In Starling's hands, Voysey's chair offers a way into the narrative</page><page sequence="6">Short Story, Brief History, 35 mm film, 1999. Filmstill and also acts as a symbol of the possibilities of time travel, both for objects and for us, in a way that makes passing reference to many films and novels, from H.G. Wells to Chris Marker. Even the reference to the swan, itself an import into western Europe, brings an element of travel as an actual and imaginative act. Just as much as the model plane or the boat in Starling's Blue Boat Black, the swan chair is a means to travel, to escape and perhaps to reinvent the past for the future. A work from 1997 called Work, made-ready, Kunsthalle Bern, expands the artist's relationship to modernist art and design in another direction. The piece exchanges the metal contents of a Marin Sausalito bicycle and an Eames aluminium group chair. The reference to an early ready-made by Duchamp is immediately apparent but in this case the technical process of the transference of one form to another is left exposed.' The metal of the two objects is left unfinished, the roughness of casting and welding retained. This evidence of the hand reflects not so much upon the labour of the artist but upon the mass production of the original units and in turn upon the cultural specificity of these desirable designer objects. As with Le jardin Suspendu, domestic references are grasped and twisted. The quotation of the Eames chair makes physical the ambition for a streamlined modernist design open to everyone. Yet Starling's copy denies this possibility for it is a unique art object only acting out an idea of mass availability - an intention that also remained unrealised by the Eames and other Utopian designers. This kind of complexity reoccurs constantly in Starling's work; a complexity that is not simply a relativist's disavowal of position because clearly there is a genuine love of the objects of modernism and the possibilities it provides. Rather, his approach is investigative, seeking to find some confirmation of the value of art and art's tradition through the process of making, remaking and thinking about the objects of that period. Of course, this remaking is imbued with all the knowledge of the time in which it is copied. Rather like the French artist Pierre Huyghe, part of whose work involves the remaking of classic moments from the modernist canon of film, Starling's remakes give us a different sense of ownership over the initial object.4 The viewer of the copy is now both more intimately acquainted with the original because s/he has seen something new in it and more distanced from it because it now belongs to a category of first-generation artefacts reproduced by the artist. The question these works arouse is, therefore, not so much how do we feel about the object itself (as a work of art) but what could it represent today, in the period after its initial appearance. By extension, this question opens up a wider discussion that includes issues about the value and status of contemporary art and design in relation to the social and political obligations suggested by</page><page sequence="7">SIMON STARLING An Eichbaum Pils beer can found on the 6th April in the grounds of the Bauhaus, Dessau, and reproduced in an edition of nine using the metal from one cast aluminium chair designed by Jorge Pensi. (The Showroom, 1995) modernism. Starling seems to be suggesting that these responsibilities are not inevitably going to be ignored as we develop a less reactive position to the challenge of early twentieth-century cultural production. A beautiful, circular 35mm film, Short Story, Brief History, made in 1999 by Starling for Dundee Contemporary Arts, encapsulates something of the possibility of recycling ideas from earlier periods. The film begins by panning horizontally and close up across a workbench stacked with materials and tools that carry all the pregnant potential of unrealised labour. At the end of the table, the camera comes to rest on a highly decorated silver Victorian fork. Lingering on this image, we slowly see the fork disassembling until it has reduced itself to a molten mass of metal that shares the same potential as the tools and materials we saw earlier. This mass then begins a reverse process of transformation as it regains its quality as a fork, only this time a simple, unornamented design of classical modern appearance. The camera then returns along the table, scrutinising the objects for any signs that they too have altered or misbehaved in any way. Finally the sequence ends and begins again, only this time the fork metamorphosises from modern to Victorian. In this way, the loop rejects the linear progression of history in favour of a more complex metaphor. The film becomes a constantly evolving narrative rather than a repetition, one in which each reappearance just might presage a different change in the identity or style of the fork. For all its strict formality, the work is extraordinarily uplifting in its suggestion that a new sensibility might emerge out of these two competing styles, and not only as new consumer choices but as ways to express attitudes about production, society and economics. The fork is magically transformed, like an act of the imagination, and therefore we can imagine it differently. We are now leaving the twentieth century and we have to decide quickly what we will take with us. Short Story, Brief History offers us the whole story in miniature, as a predetermined past and a way of forging a new mould. When modernism finally exhausted itself in an orgy of actionist dramas, expressive psychological traumas played out on abstract canvases, and the etiolated writings of fundamentalist critics, a less confrontational position was adopted by artists anxious to plot a new path for themselves and their discipline. Many strategies emerged but, for the purpose of exploring Starling's work, the individuals who turned their attention to the object, particularly the familiar, 94 domestic and everyday objects that surround us, prove most useful. These objects</page><page sequence="8">77?e Technic of Happiness, Foundations of Modern Art, Ozenfant, 1928. (Dover Publications Inc., New York, 1952) in themselves held no threat of being 'shocking' to the audience, except insofar as they were demonstrably not made of traditional high-art materials. Such an exploration had been pioneered at an early stage by Hans Bellmer, Marcel Duchamp, Louise Bourgeois and others, but much of their work had not been fully integrated into the modernist canon. So when artists as different as Bill Woodrow and Mike Kelley began to make sculptures out of the everyday, they were able to avoid immediate categorisation and made space for twisting the familiar out of the ordinary and into another imaginative space. Mike Kelley talks in 1991 about his doll works of previous years: The funny thing about dolls is that you don't notice their scale because you project into them. You're relationship is sort of an interior one, a mental one ... I'm from the generation of artists for whom there was an extreme reaction against the handmade and clich?d ideas of self-expression (but) I think it's possible now to start to look at handmade things in a different way. It's no longer heroic, as it used to be - the handmade now is pitiful and it doesn't necessarily have anything to do with emotion or a personal psychology. With my doll works, the viewer isn't led to reflect on the psychology of the artist but on the psychology of the culture.5 This last sentence seems to me exemplary as a statement not only of Kelley's work but of the larger body of work produced in the late 1980s that sought to assess modernism and its relation to audience. It is the 'psychology of culture' that these artists were dealing with and its resonance continues to vibrate in the work of an artist like Simon Starling. Blue Boat Black is one such project. The 'psychology of culture' is at issue through both the handmade exploration of transformation and the collusion of display, function and production throughout the work. The piece begins with a disused museum case from Edinburgh being transformed into a tiny fishing boat in Marseilles. The journey from Scotland to France and the shift from passive receptacle to active agent is itself an initial comment on aspects of the respective cultures. Having successfully been put to sea, the boat brings in a haul of nine fish and is then once more transmogrified, this time into charcoal with which the caught fish can be cooked. Finally, the blackened remains of the boat are returned to the gallery space to be shown alongside a model of the boat and all the materials involved in its various stages of production. As visitors to the display space, we are confronted by relics. They ask us to project life into them, as a once functioning boat, as a museum case, as firewood, as sculpture, as material, and to hold all these images in our mind at once while we consider the absurd 95 rationality of the narrative. This is where, as in all his work, Starling's complex</page><page sequence="9">SIMON STARLING relationship to modernism forces us, as viewers, to confront some of our own preconceptions about form, function and human intervention. We can choose to ascribe motivations to the progress of the museum case through its various stages but any explanation can only be personal and arbitrary. Instead, the remnants stand witness to the collision of use-value, preservation and consumption in which no single point of view can ever assume precedence. Ambivalence and fascination with process hold sway. Coincidentally, in Kettle's Yard an anthropomorphic piece of burnt timber is displayed alongside the works of art with the title St Christopher. The connection to the patron saint of travellers might be appreciated by Starling but the reference returns us full circle to the domestic, having been out on the open seas and around the world. The temptation is to satisfy our often frustrated desire for closure by ending here. However, the real success of Starling's work must come when such closure does not materialise. His work consistently maintains that we cannot slip conveniently into historicist ways of thinking. In works like Short Story, Brief History, and others such as the self-explanatory An Eichbaum Pils beer can found on 6th April 1995 in the grounds of the Bauhaus, Dessau and reproduced in an edition of nine using metal from one cast aluminium chair designed by Jorge Pensi, the artist plays with chronology in order to liberate our thinking about what we can build and how we can interpret the relics of the past. He allows what he clearly identifies as the excitement and potential of the experiments of the past to be communicated experientially to the present through the presence of his work and its abstruse surrounding narrative. Undomesticating modernism, like any process of undoing, has its dangers in reliving the obvious traps into which modern art and design fell, but modernism remains this century's most challenging and defining concept. The way its potential and its failure will be judged in the years to come will do much to determine the way we will perceive our achievements in the next decades. .
