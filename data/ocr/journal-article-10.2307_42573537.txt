<plain_text><page sequence="1">Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and Aqua Teen Hungerforce as Rabelaisian Carnival Angela Farmer Totus homo fit excrementum. -Victor Hugo From the outset, I concede that this paper aims to bring two seemingly disparate fictions together: the Early Modern fiction of François Rabelais and the cultish contemporary animated television program, Aqua Teen Hungerforce (popularly referred to as ATHF),1 a component of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, launched by Turner Broadcasting System (Time Warner) in 2001 . 2 In order to make this connection, I will rely heavily on Mikhail Bakhtin's reading of Rabelais and His World which situates the medieval writer in a postmodern dialogue, deciphering the codes of language and ritual of the carnival square by locating and translating Rabelais 's subtexts of laughter, vernacular, festival, feasting, the grotesque body, and the lower stratum.3 The goal of this paper is then to draw a parallel between Aqua Teen Hungerforce and Rabelaisian carnival as represented by Bakhtin, showing ATHF to be a vehicle which not only serves to satirically censure official policy and to critique popular culture through ribaldry and the grotesque, but also to create a sense of community by establishing an inside culture through the use of vernacular "in-jokes." On the surface ATHF is geared toward "grossing-out" the audience with a devoted mise-en-scène of vociferous expectoration, animated effluvium, and geysers of blood. Though it seems that body-comedy and abusive language are geared toward nothing more than sordid-farce, we know that there is always an imbedded element of subversion and therefore revolution.4 Those things which are considered high are subject to being brought low thereby overthrowing any position of privilege; hence, for the lowly and marginalized, burlesque contains potentially rebellious, even emancipatory, powers. Hallmark to gross-out art is scatology, sexual perversion, and billingsgate. While most toilet humor is generally accepted as a puerile fixation, Jeff Persels and Russell Ganim remark: "Sexuality in all its myriad forms has long been the darling of academic readers, a once marginalized, now legitimate field of critical investigation, commentary and theory building. Scatology, however, arguably an even more universal function than sexuality, still retains the power to make us blush, to provoke shame and embarrassment" (7). What's more, many postmodern writers, like Nathanial West whose Balso Snell searches for meaning in the entrails of the Trojan Horse, use comic scatological metaphor intended to censure social conventions like bigotry and hypocrisy.5 Further, scatological humor has the potential to go beyond absurdity. In the absurd we find, not a logical impossibility, but what is perceived to be a human impossibility which threatens coherent meaning. The humor of the carnival does not collapse into nihilism or despair, 49</page><page sequence="2">50 but rather confronts the abject, that which crosses boundaries between subject and object and subsequently causes a breakdown in meaning. Scatology, indeed part of the carnival atmosphere, is a prime example of the abj ect. Excrement (among those items listed in Kristevian theory as "defiled") is at once part of the subject and yet separate from the subject {Powers of Horror ). When an author creates a text that engages the carnivalesque in all of its radical transgressions, we might call the scatological "revolutionary shit" - revolting indeed. The visual drive of Aqua Teen Hungerforce , and many of the Cartoon Network Adult Swim animated series, is to offend and to debase. This aesthetic explains both the show's popularity and its derision; viewers either love the show or they hate it. What's more, unlike The Simpsons , Futurama , Family Guy , and South Park , ATHF uses short, disconnected, episodic logic that rejects continuity, abandons coherence, and revels in abject repulsion. This is consistent with Bakhtin's analysis of laughter and the brevity of the freedom it provides; festival, a temporary rearrangement of system, prohibitions, and hierarchies, causes a momentary abandon for which "brevity . . . increased its fantastical nature" (89). ATHF is among several "short attention span" programs currently in production; the consequence of rapid fire absurdity is twofold: first, the audience does not have time to orient itself to each new farcical situation which therefore heightens comedic effect; secondly, with the audience off balance, ATHF is able to present a revolutionary message of social critique in the form of satire. Critics agree when they say, "there's ultimately something exhilarating - and, dare I say, liberating? - about [ATHF]'s chaotic avant-garde energy" (Schager). As it is the purpose of satire to call attention to vice and direct the audience to transformation, ATHF portrays hot button topics like immigration, profanity in hip-hop lyrics, and cloning in politicized ways. Set in sickening conditions, the animated series addresses substance abuse, cosmetic surgery, cable theft, text messaging culture, copyright infringement, and sexism. The first season began with an endeavor toward a structured and cohesive plot.6 It is the second season, however, when the show hits its stride and moves from being simply an asinine sequence of humorous events to being a true satire which critiques culture and power structures while debasing those in power and elevating that which is low. With the abandon of structure, ATHF was able to embrace the absurdity necessary for a carnivalesque atmosphere; watching such a spectacle is not unlike a fever-induced Felliniesque dream. In regard to its transitory and chaotic nature, Karen Wilson, in a critique of the 2007 Aqua Teen Hungerforce Colon Movie Film for Theatres (directed by Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis), says of ATHFCMFFT: Aqua Teen is weird for the sake of being weird, and thinks everything it says is impossibly hilarious. It's a bit like Un Chien Andalou , only if Dalí and Buñuel had written their surrealist script while high from snorting pixie sticks. A familiarity with the TV show would probably increase your understanding of the movie, but it's not necessary. Even</page><page sequence="3">51 without knowing what's happening, Aqua Teen is silly nutrient-free fun. In creating itself as esoteric alternative animation, the raison d'être of ATHF is to satirize public opinion for an audience already amenable to change.7 What's more, like the carnival square of Rabelais 's Early Modern fictions, the confederacy of ATHF audience members creates a sense of community for a generation that does not have a cultural hub. This generation (or rather the converging years of Generation X and what has come to be called Generation Y) has, for the most part, never had a corner store, a civic center, or a communal sphere in the physical world.8 What this generation does have is a virtual community made up of websites like MySpace, Friendster, and Facebook;9 forget the cellphone-this is a generation of text-messaging, instant messaging, Online poking, and blogging. Moving ever faster, communicating in IM and TM abbreviatory code, community happens at the speed of cable. Not only are programs like ATHF cutting edge in their satiric content, they are brief and highly quotable. For example, on Wilson's blog, "JoeBlow" comments, "I dare any of you not to laugh at the episode 'return of the mooninites' where the moon guys wreak havoc with a belt giving them 'all of the power of 80 's [sic] supergroup Foreigner.' Genius." To which "ryan" comments: "'Fryman, fill your eyes. . .with DOUBLE VISION! '" The convergence of ATHF quotability, blogging, and cultural commentary (Foreigner and Foreigner lyrics) reveals such media to be the new carnival square where Shrovetide cynicism and folk humor, like the Rabelaisian cris de Paris , creates a festive laughter that is simultaneously ambivalent, forbidden, and a preventive to fear.10 I will now turn to situating Aqua Teen Hungerforce in a post-Disney aesthetic while tracing the political subversions of its animated predecessors. 11 I will then be able to connect contemporary "gross-out" humor, vernacular billingsgate, and festival imagery of ATHF to the subversive grotesque and scatological humor of Rabelais's Shrovetide carnivalesque fictions. Of course, Adult Swim and ATHF are not the first vehicles for animated subversion. In the 1920s, Felix the Cat became one of the most recognized film characters in the world. A black and white, silent, animated cat, time and again Felix found himself in surreal and seditious situations.12 Likewise, Max Fleisher's Betty Boop (Paramount) was an openly sexual creation; premiering just four years after Disney's watershed Steamboat Willie (1928) and two years after the birth of Warner Bros. Cartoons (1930), Betty Boop, the cartoon flapper with undeniable adult sensibilities, ran for seven successful years. Aside from the Warner Brothers Loony Tunes Censored 11, many WB shorts continue to run despite their overtly sexual and political subtexts.13 When silver screen animation set its sights on the small screen, Hanna Barbera Productions brought Ruff and Reddy (1957) and a cast of others directly to family-oriented television program blocks. Nevertheless, these shows maintained a subversive milieu from Huckleberry Hound (1958 - 1962) and The Yogi Bear Show (1961), which critics</page><page sequence="4">52 read as a vehicle to normalize sexual relationships, to the long running Scooby- Doo Where Are You (1969 - present), which is regularly alleged to contain sexual subtexts and hints at drug use.14 So, from the beginning, cartoons were never wholly for children; and in the 1990s, after a two-decade slump in the animation industry, a new wave of adult-oriented cartoons tested the limits of acceptability. In the 1990s a new crop of technically talented animators began exploring new styles and forms; traditional animation methods of drawing and inking gave way to replication and digital manipulation. This new generation produced new and more aggressive forms of animation, which incorporated not only scatological satire but also the impact of billingsgate. At the same time that animation was experiencing a reinvigoration, more experimental, bizarre, vulgar, and fantastic cartoons were being created. While Matt Groening's The Simpsons (1989 - present) and later Parker and Stone's South Park (1997 - present) satirized suburban American family life and spawned series like Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy (1999 - 2002, 2005 - present) and American Dad (2005 - present) and Mike Judge's King of the Hill (1997 - present), the adult content of Ralph Bakshi's full-length animated features paved the way for subversive television programs like John Kricfalusi's The Ren and Stimpy Show (1 99 1 - 1 996), Judge's Beavis and Butt-head (1993 -1997), Jeff Reno and Ron Osborn's Duckman (1994 - 1997), and blocks of adult programming like MTVs program block, Liquid Television (1991 - 1994), and The Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation (1990 - present).15 Though The Simpsons and South Park intentionally avoid the "realistic" Menschengestalt attempted by Disney and Don Bluth, the characters are, unlike the anthropomorphized characters of Hanna Barbera, markedly human.16 Lampooning the Golden Age of television animation where bears and dogs and mice owned businesses, played musical instruments, and harried park rangers, the cartoon characters of the 1990s "animation Renaissance" are anthropomorphic (yet slightly psychotic) animals; Ren is an abusive Chihuahua, Stimpy is a dim-witted and tailless cat, and the Duckman family are literally working-class ugly-ducks. Far from endeavoring toward a formal aesthetic of "completeness," these animated figures are grotesque, incomplete, and unsightly. In a surreal twist toward the unquestionably postmodern, a set of television cartoons (beginning with the likes of Ren and Stimpy which set the stage for ATHF) rejected the aesthetic of computer animation {a la Pixar and DreamWorks) and embraced instead a "gross-out" aesthetic, which subversively aims to shock the audience with controversial material usually serving as a vehicle of satirical social commentary.17 This approach illustrates several Bakhtinian ideas; in Rabelais and his World, Bakhtin isolates several subtexts, among them are carnivalesque and the grotesque body. For Bakhtin, " carnivalesque " refers to the carnivalizing of normal life, which he describes as something that is created when the themes of the carnival twist, mutate, and invert standard themes of societal makeup, mocking those in authority and parodying official ideas. The idea of carnivalesque also becomes associated with collectivity; those attending carnival not only constitute</page><page sequence="5">53 individuals in a crowd but rather the crowd is seen as a whole. Further, during carnival, individuals become part of collectivity and through costume and mask they cease to be themselves. At the same time, there emerges an awareness of material, bodily unity and community. Food and eating, body functions such as sex, death, birth, and defecation become part of the activities of the carnival square; therefore Bakhtin's notion of carnival is connected with the grotesque body, the body which changes through eating, evacuation, and sex. Like Rabelais 's Gargantua, it is fitting to symbolically describe the grotesque body as a perpetually eating and shitting monster; the grotesque is made up of recognizable elements, yet as a whole it clashes with our expectations. As an example, in Rabelais 's work, Gargantua and Pantagruel encounter a race of "sausage-people" about whom Pantagruel declares: "Chitterlings are Chitterlings, always duplicitous and treacherous" (Book 4, Chapter 36). Like Jonathan Swift's fantastical races, though we do not expect it, we can imagine a race of people made of food; the grotesque indeed runs contrary to post- Enlightenment logic. In carnival, flowers are animate, protagonists are beasts, and, in some cases, people are food. And this last item makes a sort of symbolic sense considering that food, a communal product, is an item around which community forms itself, is something which increases the body or extends bodily margins, and is therefore the perfect expression of the grotesque body.18 The imagery of food is unconcealed in ATHF, a program in which the main characters are a trio of anthropomorphic food items: Frylock, Master Shake, and Meatwad. The most obvious analysis reveals a pseudo-Freudian paradigm; each of the three characters distinctly embodies Id, Ego, and Superego. Frylock, an ecologically-minded package of levitating French Fries, is often cast as the moralistic Superego; Master Shake, the self-absorbed, pleasure-seeking milkshake, regularly wallows in the pleasures of the Id; and Meatwad, the juvenile and gullible yet unexpectedly astute amorphous meatball who tries to balance the desires of Frylock and Shake, is posed to be the harmonizing Ego. Frylock, typically the moralist, is concerned about meat consumption, environmental welfare, etiquette, and education. Humor is constructed around this character through incongruity; that is to say, he typically tries to take "the high road" but given the actions of his associates, he ends up compromising his ethical stance for something inferior. Here, the carnival element is unmistakable: the lofty is brought low. Master Shake, typically (though not always) the source of Frylock's frustration, on the other hand, is entirely narcissistic; ever the pleasure seeker, Shake is discourteous, presumptuous, and gluttonous. In this case, humor is generated around the absurdity of Shake's urges and his constant refusal to take responsibility for his actions. What's more, Shake's gluttony is often monstrous and deforming. For instance, in "Super Bowl," Shake gorges himself on nacho chips in an effort to win Superbowl tickets; because of his diet, Shake becomes obese, blemished, immobile, and anemic. Pocked with bulbous acne, Shake's gluttony-both his greed for the tickets and his excessive intake-reveal the consequences of prolonged carnival. Limited to Shrovetide, one week, carnival is considered an adequate release; prolonged gluttony causes the</page><page sequence="6">54 corruption which carnival is intended to resist. Aside from Shake's continual greed, the typical mise-en-scène of ATHF reveals it to be akin to the popular festive forms of Rabelasian carnival. Where the sacred rituals of baptism, marriage, funeral, and ordination were parodied in paschal festivals, ATHF also parodies "sacred" rituals. In "Mail Order Bride," Shake and Carl decide to co-marry a Chechnyan prostitute. Shake wants a wife to cook for him, while Carl wants a predictable sex partner; in "Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary," Shake attempts to update the traditional birthday ritual; in "The Dressing," the traditional Thanksgiving feast is interrupted by Turk-E-Tron who is convinced that the Aqua Teens' dinner is the ancestor of the new messiah; in "Super Birthday Snake," "Video Ouija," and "Grim Reaper Gutters," death and funereal rituals are lampooned. Though the first episodes made an attempt at cohesiveness (the trio were crime-solving detectives), it was quickly and shrewdly abandoned. This rejection of traditional narrative form and intentional lack of structure goes to the heart of Rabelaisian carnival, which lampoons traditional forms, rituals, and structures. What remains, then, is a plot-line which revolves around little more than "stunts" pulled by the trio who live in New Jersey and bother their neighbor, Carl. Really, there is less a plot and more a set of loosely related incidents which lead to the death of a character (don't worry, they reappear in the next episode as if nothing happened) or a punch-line of a sexual or scatological nature. That's it. As it was formerly said of the popular Seinfeld series, this is a show about nothing. But not really. On many levels, this show is a reclamation of the political aspect of carnivalesque through the use of grotesque bodies, ribaldry, scatological humor, and satire. Dana Stevens says, " Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters is like the bright-colored gunk you might vomit up after a weekend of gorging on cartoons.... But when I compare the movie to vomit, I don't mean it in a bad way - a paradox that Willis and Maiellaro, with their scatological, stoner-friendly humor, would probably understand." Comparing ATHF to purging after gorging is just the image I want to sustain as it is the image most consistent with the carnivalesque grotesque body, which changes and revolves with the intake and excrement of food. Another of the primary elements of grotesque bodies is played out in this animated series; the body itself is manifested with the protuberances and offshoots that Bakhtin defined for the grotesque body: ... the grotesque body. ... is not a closed, completed unit; it is unfinished, outgrows itself, transgresses its own limits. . . . This means that the emphasis is on the apertures or the convexities, or on various ramifications and offshoots. . . . One of the fundamental tendencies of the grotesque image of the body is to show two bodies in one. . . . From one body a new body always emerges in some form or other. (25) The grotesque body is compared to a hydra, with its many heads that, once severed,</page><page sequence="7">55 regenerate in multiplicity. It is not a stretch to recognize the Aqua Teens as having grotesque bodies; Frylock's fries are able to extend to become hand-like and to become weapons that shoot projectiles (lightning, lasers, fireballs). He also has "Frydar," a single fry that rises out of his head to become a satilite dish. From his eyes, Frylock is able to vaporize items, to blast holes, and to spray fire extinguisher foam ("Dusty Gozongas"). While it is useless, Shake too has a protuberant "bendy" straw which extends out of the top of his head. (It is useful to note that Shake is the only member of the Aqua Teens that has no "superpower"; this may be either a cause or an affect of his flawed morality.) Meatwad, as I have said, is amorphous; a shape-shifting ball of meat, Meatwad rolls around collecting fuzz and lint which offshoot from his body. He is also able to change forms entirely; when wearing clothes, Meatwad fills the form of the clothing, seeming to have arms and legs and shoulders; other shapes that Meatwad regularly assumes are of a hotdog (including bun and condiment), a hammer, and an igloo. While Meatwad's ability to change shape may not be seen as a 'superpower," it is at least useful. During "T-Shirt of the Living Dead," for example, Meatwad turns into a hammer that Shake uses to smash a museum display and steal its contents. Another element of the grotesque body is that it defies age markers; it is always on the brink of both birth and death. Although there have been episodes ("Spirit Journey Formation Anniversary," for one) where the Aqua Teens have stated an age, we get the distinct impression that these are misguided or otherwise inaccurate numbers. The bodies of the Aqua Teens are set in contrast to other characters' bodies. This reveals their interactions as intentionally attentive to the formation of animated bodies. Incidental characters like Monstermothman, the Frat Aliens, Bart Oats, Zakk Wylde, and Roboturketron add to the diversity of the cast, creating the same sense present in the carnival square where masquerade and disguise created an alternate reality; faces and forms become radically unrecognizable. A prime example is the garret-dwelling housemate, Willie Nelson, who appears only for one episode ("The Shaving") in which he introduces himself as the monster who lives in the Aqua Teens' attic and tries to retrieve his mail. Though his name is Willie Nelson, he clarifies that he's "not the Willie Nelson, but my name is Willie Nelson." He is neither recognizable as Willie Nelson nor as a monster; an onion with spider legs, Willie Nelson is non-confrontational and unable to frighten anyone, that is, until the last few moments of the episode where we see Willie's abode strewn with human body parts just before he rips Carl's limbs off to drink his "juice." The grotesquery of the image of Willie Nelson dismembering a lead character contradicts his former passivity and encourages non-sequitur logic. Such logic defies traditional reason and, therefore, corresponds to carnival sensibilities. Another vivid example of dislodged rationale is "Hypno-Germ," which begins with Shake characteristically sitting in front of the television and rapidly dissolves into an absurd hallucination. Meatwad is on the floor next to Shake when Frylock (paternalistically) calls Shake from another room. Rather than answering, Shake indulges himself and satisfies his pleasure drive by staying seated in front of</page><page sequence="8">56 the television. The most severe consequences come from Shake's inattentiveness; in the episode absurdly titled simply "The," Master Shake's egotism leads to the ruination of the group and their home. Frylock moves out and leaves Shake to his own devices, but by the end of the episode Shake resorts to burning styrofoam for warmth and accumulating decaying chicken carcasses for nutrition. As a result of his negligence, Meatwad, Shake, and even Carl have all contracted conjunctivitis; grotesquely bulbous, throbbing, and oozing puss, their eyes are swollen shut. Of course, Frylock returns and sets things right by resuming his quasi-parental role. The same is true for "Hypno-Germ." When Frylock, sounding every bit the disciplinarian required by the Superego, calls to Shake repeatedly, Shake sends Meatwad in his stead; Meatwad, acting as the intermediary for the Id (Shake) and the Superego (Frylock), rolls into the back room. As usual for ATHF, these first few moments are the only place where any formal logic prevails. The remainder of the episode subsides into a sequence of absurdities. This is not to say that the rest of the episode is meaningless; this particular episode tests first the limits of scatological abjection and then the boundaries of racism. After discovering that Frylock has found a toilet seat which Shake has stolen from a bathroom in Branson, Shake predictably denies the event. Childlike and oblivious to the potentially humiliating element of his narrative, Meatwad reminds Shake of the details (which we are learning for the first time): "Yeah, you ate that batch of bad ribs after the Gatlin Brothers' concert and made Frylock blow the door off that truck-stop bathroom 'cuz you said you couldn't wait for the bathroom key, squeezing your butt together tryin' to keep it in." Still, Shake denies the event, so as evidence, Frylock shows Shake a home movie of the incident. The physical humor of the scene is heightened when the audience realizes the ridiculousness of the existence of such a recording in the first place. Here absurdity collapses into abjection; unable to confront the separation of his self from his feces, Shake revisits the scene: "I want to see this again. Rewind," Shake watches (and therefore we watch) Shake's intestinal discomfort a second time. This is nothing new for the ATHF audience as waste and the act of excreting are described in graphic detail in most episodes. For example, in "Total Re-Carl" Meatwad acts as an enthusiastic voyeur to Carl's "business." After watching Carl consume espresso and fiber tablets dipped in stool softener, Meatwad tells Frylock: "Shoot, that boy's gonna poop himself inside out. He's gonna lift right off the gound. He's gonna be like the Hulk rippin right out the back of his pants! . . . It's gonna smell like a paper mill. You know dat, don't ya?" Such details are akin to degradation, which Rabelais connects to regeneration. Functions of the lower stratum operate within the grotesque in a dual manner: excrement and death lead way to renewal and life (Bakhtin 370 - 71). Much like Kenny McCormick from South Park who is killed in nearly every episode, the characters of ATHF often die and are regenerated, therefore representing eternal revolution. As "Hypno-Germ" progresses, Shake hallucinates progressively stranger events that are only tenuously strung together. At one point Shake experiences schizophasia, or "word salad." His hallucinations (talking file cabinets) talk to him</page><page sequence="9">57 in a string of utterly meaningless words and phrases. The few phrases that do make sense are death threats (however, perceived as benign in Shake's altered state) and the suggestion to "wear a hat made out of foil" and "smear yourself with garbage and try to cross the freeway." Shake does. Frylock informs us that "The Hypno- Germs" are causing Shake's hallucinations and that they like to take control of the host's mind and "star in plays that they have written after they've been drinking." What's more, they are only susceptible to the pupa of brincadores, or "Mexican jumping beans." In order to cure Shake, Frylock injects him with cydia deshaisiana, the species of moth that creates the Mexican jumping bean phenomenon. Rather than ending Shake's malady immediately, the "beans" join in the badly written and pathetically performed play (in this case, Rapunzel). During the course of the play, the protagonist "Donna" is imprisoned because she loves "Pancho" who abandons her in the tower when he meets "a younger, more illegal bean who wasn't in prison [who then] bore him many children and sued his ass for custody of them." Pancho is inexplicably, and graphically, shot in the head, turned into a brain-eating zombie who then leads the Beans to drive the Hypno-Germs out of Shake. Again, this episode resolves itself scatalogically; the evidence of his cure is that Shake farts out of his "ocular cavities" and speaks Spanish. So, we can see that there is an eventual pattern if not narrative cohesion in ATHF. Each episode begins with momentary banality that rapidly spirals into illogical absurdism, crosses into abjection (the state where the subject feels alienated from himself in some way) and inexplicably resolves. Inevitably, there is a social commentary in the mix. Some of the prevalent subjects of such commentary are racism, sexism, and conservationism. For example, these elements play out in "Total Re-Carl" where what begins as a treatise on water conservation rapidly becomes scatological and absurd; Frylock has invented an "environmentally friendly" toilet that does not require water but rather operates by vacuum because each traditional flush uses "three gallons" of water. (Frylock repeats this figure until it becomes nearly doxological.) In an attempt to test his invention, Frylock gives the prototype to Carl who is subsequently sucked into the vacuum, shredded, and sprayed all over his own lawn. Dismemberment in Bakhtin connects the parodie to the divine (351). Carl's dismembering, his head on a "silver platter" toilet seat, parodies the beheading of Saint John the Baptist, equal to grotesque images of medieval parodies of the divine (Bakhtin 350 - 51). The Aqua Teens attempt to reanimate Carl by first attaching his head to a corpse (which rejects the head) and ultimately a toy dump truck. The ever-increasing irrationality of this episode sends the message that conservationism, while righteous (Frylock only ever sets out to do noble things), can rapidly become illogical. We continue to see carnivalesque questioning of conservative ideas in episodes like "Global Grilling" and "Revenge of the Trees." "Global Grilling," which begins with Shake expectorating large wads of phlegm into a child's wading pool in order to make a mucus man, is a critique of the global warming debate. After contemptuously scorning Frylock's all-natural, "environmentally friendly"</page><page sequence="10">58 George Washington grill which "doesn't use carbon based fossil fuels or emit chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, which are the main culprits behind global warming," Master Shake purchases the Char-Nobyl 6000 Radio- Active Grill, a barbecue grill which uses "actual pieces of the sun combined with some radioactive vials from Chernobyl" and causes heat shimmering which extends for several feet, lights fire to Carl's back-hair, and begins to melt the mucus man. In defense of his grill, Shake declares, "He's not melting. He's chillaxing. If you can't speak the language, go back to Mexico-where you were born and are from." Later in the episode when Shake is trying to find someone to turn off the grill for him, he says, "Wait! Mex- Mexicans! They'll do it! They'll do anything. [Aside] Who here knows Spanish?" This kind of racial billingsgate is not uncommon in ATHF. In "Total Re-Carl," racialism is directed not only at "Mexicans" but at blacks as well. When trying to reanimate Carl's head, Shake brings an elderly black man's body for Carl's reattachment. When Carl is shocked at the appearance of his "new" body, Shake says, "This is not a time for you to be picky Carl. That's all you can get when you go to the West End." Such commentary is not direct racism but is rather a critique of racism. By putting the comments in the mouth of an immoral character, the commentary becomes a satirical critique of racism. The "Global Grilling" grill does more than elicit Shake's racial commentary to "Let the Mexicans do it"; it also creates a "flavor beam," a blast of radiation that extends to the heavens and sets clouds on fire. It also hastens global warming when Shake accidentally leaves it on over night: "It's in self cleaning mode," he tells Frylock, who replies, "It's in burn-a-hole-in-the ozone-mode!" Ever the Freudian egoist, rather than take responsibility for the catastrophe, Shake slathers himself with cream cheese in place of sun-block so that he can comfortably sit in Carl's pool (which has melted). Frylock chides, "Or we could shut the [censored profanity] grill off!" But it's too late; the planet is in ruins, a tidal wave has washed over New Jersey, and a Polar Bear has drifted into the Aqua Teens' yard where he proceeds to eat Meatwad's head. The only thing which can survive the plight brought on by Shake's self-absorption is a race of "Mucus Men" who eventually enslave the Aqua Teens and Carl; Meatwad alone is spared and made the leader of the Mucus Men. The whole episode turns out to be imagined, and, in the rather abrupt ending, Meatwad picks up an American flag, while Shake addresses the audience, "That's why you gotta eat your boogers. . . That's the message I'm spreading to America." This is amusing because typically Frylock moralizes at the end of each episode; for instance, at the end of "Universal Remonster," Frylock tells Oglethorpe and Err (who have been stealing cable), "Look, You don't need TV. It just ends up owning you. Next time you get bored, try reading a book." His platitudes are ironic, and he regularly backs down from his high-mindedness and takes a more practical stance. After buying a high definition plasma screen TV, Frylock declares that TV is a waste of time but "We [beep]-ing need it!" But for "Global Grilling," it is Master Shake who climbs on the proverbial soapbox. The situation is humorous enough in and of itself. The ludicrousness of Shake's explanation of the dangers of global</page><page sequence="11">59 grilling mushrooms as he tells us, "Our future is at stake, and it's in your nose. You've gotta eat your boogers America - for your grandchildren's LIVES!" While this episode has éléments of abject repulsion, it is firmly based in a critique of the current ecological debate. Like "Global Grilling," "Revenge of the Trees" illustrates conservationist concern but does so within a carnivalesque frame; Master Shake, after having dumped a vat of cooking oil in the forest, is put on trial by justice-seeking trees. This episode addresses ecology from a dual perspective-it is about more than just trees. The inciting incident is, in fact, the consumption of meat. Planning a Labor Day cook-out, Frylock has prepared tofu "steaks" for the trio and Carl. Discontented, Carl walks away saying, "Yeah, happy Fucking Labor Day there," until Master Shake approaches with a cow (which he "got" from a farm). Together, Shake and Carl inject the cow with cheese, hoist it over a giant flash-fiyer with a crane, cook the animal whole, and then consume it while squatting in the driveway. Frylock, frustrated at the group's insistence on eating animal flesh, reminds Shake to dispose of the oil at a recycling facility. It is only after the fryer attracts vermin and flies that Shake takes the oil, not to a recycling center, but to the woods where he dumps the debris. As usual, a surreal sequence of events follows (including Shake tarring his entire lawn to keep the vengeful trees from taking root), and the group is put on trial. In the end, the trees, who have no written laws because paper is an atrocity, cannot find justice, and Frylock presents his characteristic oration. Racism and ecological concerns are not the only carnivalized criticisms imbedded in ATHF. Homophobia, misogyny, and health care come under fire in an absurdist fashion as well. For instance, Carl, ever the «ôer-masculine homophobe, makes anti-gay comments in nearly every episode; rather than agreeing with Carl, the audience is expected to recognize the commentary as unreasonable. In the episodes "Love Mummy," "Mail Order Bride," "Frat Aliens," "The Clowning," and "Dusty Gozongas," Carl's treatment of women and sex is disparagingly represented. Carl's fixation with pornography is humorously represented as irrational in "Global Grilling"; as New Jersey is flooded by a tidalwave from a melted polar cap, Carl's only concern is his video collection. Drowning, he cries, "Oh, no - no - no - no! My father's amateur porno! I love you dad! And all those money shots!" Immature sexuality and homophobia (and driving while drinking, fraternity hazing, and a plethora of other social practices) are critiqued through a scatological frame of inebriated purgation in "Frat Aliens." When Carl erects a laser security system that is so invasive it can be seen from space, two drunken collegiate aliens, Skeeter and D.P., land in Carl's yard and attempt to initiate an affair with one of the Aqua Teens. Though the gender of the Teens is assumed male (the masculine pronoun is used in the script), there is nothing specifically masculine about any of them except Frylock who sports a deep voice and facial hair.19 After striking up an argument with Carl, D.R threatens: "Do you want me to mess up your pizza face in front of your girlfriend over there [indicating Frylock]?" Though Frylock, Shake, and eventually Meatwad reject D.R's repeated advances, he tells Skeeter, "This girl totally wants</page><page sequence="12">60 me." In its sick and twisted way, this scene provides ATHF's audience, for the most part college age viewers, a much needed exhortation that regardless of alcohol intake, "no" means "no."20 Adding to their misogynistic remarks, Skeeter tries to make D.P. leave. He does not tell him to leave Meatwad alone because (s)he is uninterested, but rather derides Meatwad's appearance; Skeeter says, "Dude forget it. She was sporting some major lbs," to which D.P. replies, "Ah, common. It's like a moped; fun to ride until your friends see you." The Frat Aliens are not a model to be followed but rather, much as the Shrovetide carnival served to critique unacceptable social behaviors, function rhetorically like an epidictic; the Frat Aliens are vile and therefore the audience is instructed by their negative example to (in the folk vernacular) "don't be that guy." Ever abused by Shake's undeniable pleasure-drive, Meatwad is portrayed as an innocent. Unlike the Ego, which is able to completely harness the impulses of both Id and Superego, Meatwad is a keen observer of human nature. In his critique of Rabelais, A. N. Veselovski compares Rabelaisian cynicism to "a healthy village boy" who is dirty "with springlike, animal gaiety" (Bakhtin 146). However, neither Rabelais 's Pantagruel nor Meatwad are the innocents of the Manneken-Pis of Brussels; both are childlike, but they are also openly vulgar and sexual. And as truth falls from the mouths of babes, Meatwad is typically revealed to be the silent sage. This too creates humor as he more usually performs with a childlike demeanor. In "Universal Remonster," Meatwad thinks the dysfunctional TV is a snow globe, and in "Total Re-Carl," Meatwad's artlessness is revealed; when, in "T-Shirt of the Living Dead," he is granted the power to do anything, Meatwad summons The Easter Bunny and Santa Claus. While Carl's disembodied head is connected to Frylock's computer, Carl's thoughts are translated into text and he starts interjecting vulgarity, or as Frylock says, "dropping F-bombs." Frylock tells him, "Don't look over here. These are words you don't need to learn," and the following dialogue ensues: Meatwad: I'm going to start dropping F-bombs in a minute. Listen to this: Fart you farthead! Shake: That's not how F-bombs are dropped you idiot. Meatwad: Oh, the fart it is, you farter. Fart all y'all. Y'all go fart yourself. Ultimately, though Meatwad is portrayed as the most naïve of the Teens, like Rabelais's Pantagruel, he is the seat of misguided wisdom and can also be the source of unexpected savvy. For example, we see in a number of episodes that he loves to watch tame children's programming on public television and is easily frightened by Shake's taste for the horror genre; however, when watching one of his favorite shows, Meatwad crosses the boundaries between puerile infantilism into brash vulgarity. On a public television station, an "educational" song repeats, "This is your left, this is your right" for seemingly endless bars when the refrain gives</page><page sequence="13">61 interactive instructions: "Lean to your left [Meatwad leans] - - uh, uh that's your right" to which Meatwad exclaims, "Oh, dammit!" And again, Meatwad displays his perspicacity; an animate remote control device changes the television channels, and Meatwad updates us on each program, "Donna's about to tell Carlos she got breast cancer ... oh, watch this [guy bowling], he needs this to get his championship . . . lookie here; this dude is gonna squeeze that boy until blood comes out his eyes. Oh, damn! D'you see that? That's a mature situation." Meatwad is the glue that holds the Teens together, like an egg-based binding for a meatball. Just as paschal celebrations hold the rest of the liturgical calendar together by providing release through shifting Shrovetide/Carnival social communion, without Meatwad's ability to morph, not just physically, but from infant to philosopher, the team would be lost. Earlier this year, the Aqua Teens ventured onto the silver screen and though the rapid-fire carnivalesque pranks present in fifteen minute episodes seemed unsustainable for a two hour feature, reviewers confirm that there is something tunny going on in both ATHF and ATHFCMFFT, even if we aren't all in on the joke. With its cult following, the ATHF series serves as a carnival square for a sub- set of a generation without a central seat. In this light, some critics, when discussing the series, see the coherence of the whole while others revel in the incoherence of each individual episode (some flat-out hate it). Paradoxically, it is in random folly that cohesion exists as carnival. It is the carnival of food and of shit and of sex and of death; it is the overthrowing of old expectations and the assertion of a worldview that doesn't need to be coherent to be enjoyable. But such revelry does require brevity to remain enjoyable. While discussing the film, described as madly brilliant, insane, surreal, bizarre, absurdist, insider, ingenious, and ribald, the duration of the movie is the sticking point; like a prolonged Shrovetide would be unhealthy overindulgence, audiences cannot sustain protracted Rabelasian humor on the scale of ATHFCMFFT (Ochieng, Orndorf). While incoherence is not only the point but indeed the triumph of the movie, length, it is generally agreed, is its downfall. As often as critics say that there is no point in looking for a point to the ATHF series, the point seems to be made clearer: ATHF aims at being random; but like the carnival, time is of the essence. Notes 'For the sake of clarity, I will deviate from standard format by citing episodes titles in quotation marks while italicizing program titles. Films will remain in italics. Therefore Aqua Teen Hungerforce - the T.V. series - will appear ATHF; the film will be cited Aqua Teen Hungerforce (or ATHFCMFFT as it is referred to by supporters), and shows like "Robot Chicken" and "South Park" will be cited Robot Chicken and South Park.</page><page sequence="14">62 2 For those unfamiliar with the Aqua Teens, you may recall the recent controversy in Boston. In January of 2007, the city was well-nigh shut down because of a publicity stunt initiated by the producers of ATHF for the premiere of Aqua Teen Hungerforce Colon Movie Film for Theatres who placed "ominous" small black boxes with light boards around tall buildings and bridges; these "light bright" advertisements portrayed Mooninites, Ignignokt and Err, (the pixilated aliens who play ancillary roles in ATHF) flipping-off the general public. Though the incident caused Boston a great deal of trouble and municipal funds, the film received more attention than it could have purchased. 3 The carnival square, which Bakhtin is quick to distinguish from contemporary holiday culture which pales in comparison to the unbridled lusting, crazed bingeing, and even physical mutilation that occurred in the Renaissance carnival, is a great leveler. In carnival, all bets are off, and the mighty are brought low while fools are exalted; in this space, full of bawdy / body humor, the censure of polity is accepted. 4 Bakhtin insists that, by disrupting systems of decorum, such parodies have the potential to create an apparatus of reform: "the place for working out a new mode of interrelationship between individuals . . . People who in life are separated by impenetrable hierarchical barriers enter into free and familiar contact on the carnival square" (123). 5 For a more complete conversation, see Doug Haynes, "'Laughing at the Laugh': Unhappy Consciousness in Nathanael West's The Dream Life of Balso Snell ," which links the black humor of West's novel to Hegel's "unhappy consciousness" and as an avant-garde response to modernity and industry, locating the writer within a broader discourse of subversive satire. 6 The trio ran a detective agency, but this premise was abandoned almost immediately. In later seasons, the concept is occasionally mentioned in passing. 7 In order to punctuate the revolutionary aspect of ATHF, consider that the theme song was written by and is performed by Schoolly D, a hard-core rapper who pioneered the gangsta rap movement. 8 During the 1990s, there was a move toward the shopping mall as cultural hub; this trend seems to have waned significantly. 9 Just like the rationale of the "Wall" application of My Space and Facebook, there is no apparent logic to the commentary. One must "unravel" the wall, read the "Wall- to- Wall" application, in order to decode the conversation. 10 For more information see Bakhtin, "Rabelais in the History of Laughter" (59 - 144). 11 Here in the U.S., Adult Swim shares space with Cartoon Network and Boomerang and features absurdist, often ribald, comedy as well as minimally edited Japanese anime. Among Adult Swims comedy programming are "Moral Orel" (a stop- motion animation parody of the children's Christian program "Davey and Goliath"), "Robot Chicken," "Saul of the Molemen," "Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law," "Space Ghost Coast to Coast," and "Aqua Teen Hungerforce."</page><page sequence="15">63 12 Felix the Cat was revived in the 1950s, and the series ran as reruns well into the 1970s. For full information about the legacy of Felix, see John Canemaker, Felix : The Twisted Tale of the Worlds Most Famous Cat. 13 In 1968 this list was created by United Artists (then owners of the A.A.P. library). "The Censored 11" are considered too racist or too politically incorrect and are currently withheld from distribution. 14 Jeffery P. Dennis outlines the ways in which animated television programs from the 1950s to the present either concede to gay and lesbian identities or (in surreal cartoons) ignore gay and lesbian identities while presenting same-sex desire as ordinary and even vital and worthwhile. 15 Including the X Rated Fritz the Cat (1972), a graphic adaptation of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings (1978), and the sexually explicit live-action/animation Cool World (1992) staring Kim Basinger and Brad Pitt. 16 For a more complete conversation about animation and aesthetics, see Judith Yaross Lee's work (forthcoming in 2009 by the University Press of Mississippi), Twain s Brand: Humor in Contemporary American Culture , which addresses recent American graphic humor. 17 "Gross-out" describes a fêted movement in visual, musical, and performance art. 18 What's more, the root of "carnevale" is 'carne' - "meat" (carrying connotations of food and feasting) or "flesh" (carrying connotations of bodies and sex). 19 There are frequent references to gender confusion in both the series and in the film. 20 There is also an element of anti-anti-homosexuality in this episode. Feeling vulnerable after his encounter with the Aliens, Meatwad reasserts his masculinity, "I'm a man's man! . . . And if y'all need me, I'm gonna be in the garage hanging sheetrock around the engine I'm rebuilding!" But to show his immaturity and worldly inexperience, he reappears at the end of the episode wearing an earring, black spandex and a studded leather cap and declares: "I'm not bi. I'm a man, boy. I'm macho. Far as that, how come my muscles be all big wearing this spandex?" Shake replies, "Right. You're full-blown gay," and the end credits role.
