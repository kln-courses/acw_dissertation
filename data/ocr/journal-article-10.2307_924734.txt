<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. 35, No. 2 ETHNOMUSICOLOGY SPRING/SUMMER 1991 Jogis and Nirgun Bhajans in Bhojpuri-Speaking India: Intra-Genre Heterogeneity, Adaptation, and Functional Shift EDWARD O. HENRY DEPARTMENT OF ANTHROPOLOGY, SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY specially during the spring harvest, when food grains are more abundant, mendicant musicians called Jogis appear in the villages of eastern Uttar Pradesh, playing their sarangis (bowed lutes) and singing nirgun bhajans.' These songs share characteristic features with the poetry accredited to Kabir, the medieval Indian saint to which most of them are self- attributed. They emphasize the transitory nature of life, non-attachment to the mundane, the inevitability of death, and salvation through devotion. The term nirgun or nirgun is a Hindi word deriving directly from the Sanskrit nirgun, and meaning "without form." It refers to the deity concept with which these songs are associated; the nirgun deity has no form or attributes. The belief system of the songs contrasts sharply with the dominant sagun (Hindi: "having form") religious traditions of this region, which center on Krishna, Ram, and other anthropomorphic deities. In addition to the nirgun 'The field research upon which this article is based was supported by grants from the National Institute of Mental Health, Indo-American Subcommission on Culture and Education, and San Diego State University. I transcribed and translated the song lyrics into Hindi with the help of village teachers and, in a few cases, intercollege students. I would especially like to acknowledge the assistance of Shri Ramah Kant Pandey, Shri Indra Jit Pande, and Shri Parsotam Sharma. In preparing the English translations for this essay I consulted with Dr. Y. N. Sinha, originally from Muzzafarpur in north-central Bihar (on the periphery of the Bhojpuri language region); his wife, Savitri Sinha, from Chapra, Bihar, in the heart of the Bhojpuri area; and their son-in-law, Dr. Braj Bhushan Pande, originally from Ballia District in eastern Uttar Pradesh, also in the heart of the Bhojpuri region. Because the songs are mostly in Bhojpuri, with some Hindi, they were well-qualified to assist in the translation, and I am grateful for their time and interest. I also thank Dr. Merle Hogg of the Department of Music, San Diego State University for assistance with the transcriptions, Ms. Rachael Litonjua-Witt of Media Technology Services, and Dr. Daniel Whitney and Ms. Kathy Peck of the Department of Anthropology for computer assistance. Thanks also to the readers of the first draft of this paper for valuable feedback. 221</page><page sequence="2">222 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 bhajans, Jogis also sing philosophical songs; more ordinary hymns based on Hindu mythology; and an epic, Raja Bbarathari. The nirgun bhajans of eastern Uttar Pradesh belong to a class of philosophical songs that exhort the pursuit of salvation through non- attachment, and devotion that is more internally than externally manifest. They rebel, explicitly or implicitly, against priestly dominance. More often than not founded in monism, in different regions they combine ideas from Buddhist mysticism, Advaita Vedanta, Tantrism, Yoga, the Nath cults, and Sufism. Such heterodox, sometimes anti-Brahmanical songs are sung through- out India. Many of the songs from Bengal belonging to the dehotattvo (also spelled debatattva) category would be called nirgun bhajans in eastern Uttar Pradesh. (Capwell 1986:77, 180, 182, 200; Bhattacarya 1969:102; Dasgupta 1969:368; and Ray 1988:79, 139). Ray reports that in Assam these songs are sung as dehbiccarargt (ibid:139). In Andhra Pradesh such songs fall into an obviously related category called tattva (Vinjamuri Seetha Devi 1985:52-53). Tattva or tatva in Sanskrit means the true or essential nature (Apte 1965:464), but in Hindi (and no doubt other Indian languages), it also means theory, principle, and truth (Chaturvedi and Tiwari 1970:239). Srivastava reports that the nirgun tradition in Rajasthan is essentially the same as that in eastern Uttar Pradesh (1974:205-08). So north, east, south and west, Indian people sing songs expressing a system of belief distinct from and in many ways anthithetical to the mainstream, anthropomorphic beliefs. In one of the villages in eastern Uttar Pradesh in which this research was carried out the nirgun bhajans were the only conventional expressions of non-sagun religious ideology I encountered in a thirteen-month stay, which shows the importance of music in the transmission and maintenance of ideology in this region. Villagers in eastern Uttar Pradesh are led to believe that the singers of nirgun bhajans are Hindu ascetics not only by the song lyrics, which employ Hindu religious terminology and references, and the names of Hindu deities, but by their apparel (including turbans, which are not commonly worn in this region), their caste name (jog! is the local pronunciation of the word yogi), and frequently, by their self-styled Hindu names, such as Gorakh Baba and Kabir Das. Villagers believed that they came from the Gorakh Nath monastery in Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh, one hundred and twenty kilometers to the north. In fact, however, those Jogis I was able to track down were members of a caste of Muslim householders and laborers living in Khalsai, a village in Azamgarh District. (In a previous publication the village name was inadvertently spelled Khalrsa.) This dual identity renders the heterodox songs of the Jogis all the more curious. (For an explanation of how a caste of Muslims came to sing these songs, see Henry 1988a:185-89.)</page><page sequence="3">Jogis and Nirgun Bhajans in Bhojpuri-Speaking India 223 PHOTOGRAPH 1. A Jogi who gave his name only as Cote Lal. Jakhanian, Ghazipur District, Uttar Pradesh, March, 1978.</page><page sequence="4">224 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 My previous study of the Jogis and their nirgun bhajans centered on the meaning and significance of the song texts (ibid. 1988a: 160-91). Here I focus on the musical style of the songs and musical and textual differences between different versions of one song. One characteristic of the song corpus stands out: regardless of the largely unified conceptual pool from which they draw, the musical style of the songs is quite heterogeneous. Why should this be, when the songs have the same topics, and are sung by men of the same social category for audiences of the same type? Differences between versions of the same song text are also germaine to this problem. The first argument here is that intra-genre heterogeneity in song style is common in this region, and results from first, a lack of restriction on composition, and secondly, adaptation, in both the musical and the ecological senses; pre-existing music is changed to fit a new situation, and changed in order to survive. The second argument is that several genres in the region, nirgun bhajan probably among them, have undergone a type of functional shift which is widespread in and outside of India: once ritual requirements and expressions of an in-group ideology, they now serve as well to entertain outsiders. The functional shift is actually a precursor to the adaptation. This article begins by comparing musical transcriptions of three versions of one song to reveal their great differences. The music of a fourth song provides additional contrast and perspective. A comparison of the texts of the first three songs focuses on lexical discrepancies. The essay ends with discussions of musical adaptation and functional change. Comparing Versions of the Song "HFrd Ratan" ("Precious Gem") The song "HiWr Ratan" seems to stand out as an especially popular nirgun bhajan among the Jogis of eastern Uttar Pradesh. This idea is not an artifact of my field technique. In recording the songs presented here I used two different elicitation procedures. Initially, when living in the village where the first version was recorded in 1971 and 1972, my approach was simply to record what the musician performed in the mendicant context, without prodding of any kind other than the Hindi equivalent of "Please sing a song." In 1978 and 1990 in Khalsa I asked specifically for nirgun bhajans and the epic, Raja Bharathari. I asked for no other particular song. Employing these techniques I recorded three versions of one song text, set to three different melodies by three different singers. Kabir Das was the singer recorded first--in August 1971 in a village in Ghazipur District. As was the case with most of the Jogis when they were away from their home village, he was reluctant to talk about himself, but said that he was from Azamgarh District, the district adjacent to the north. He sang and played with a fairly regular beat throughout, although at times the text</page><page sequence="5">Jogis and Nirgun Bhajans in Bhojpuri-Speaking India 225 PHOTOGRAPH 2. Khalamii Jogi. Village Khalsti, Azamgarh District, Uttar Pradesh, January, 1990.</page><page sequence="6">226 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 seems jammed into the tune, and the beat isn't perfectly maintained. The singer was in his teens, and his abilities with words and music were still developing. As is typical for the genre, the saranigi introduces the piece, preceding a vocal alap of a few seconds in this case, and provides rough unison and drone accompaniment as well as interludes between sung stanzas. The sarangi has been used for centuries in North India to accompany the singing and dancing of courtesans as well as the vocalists of royal courts, and more recently, the concert halls and soirees of the upper classes. The sararigi is held vertically, facing away from the player. The left hand fingers do not stop the strings by depressing them to a fingerboard, as on the violin. Instead the nails of the first or second finger are held against the string and slide up or down it to effect pitch changes. Most Jogis bow only two strings, with a few bowing only one. A few singers had mounted jingle bells on the horsehair bow, which is held with the right hand, palm up. The string nearest the player's left hand is tuned to a higher pitch than the inside string, which in some songs is tuned to the tonic but in others is tuned to the fifth or some other degree of the scale lower than the tonic. The melody is played mostly on the outside string, while the inside string acts as a drone. The classical sarangi may have as many as forty sympathetic strings; the tattered instruments of the Jogis were often bereft of them. The basic melodic structure of almost all of the songs is what has been called the stbayi-antara form. The initial melodic strain (sthbyi) alternates with one or more antaras, a strain usually in a higher range. The antar-a may in some cases be delivered in free rhythm. This version of the song employs a very limited sthayi-antard form. For example, the melody to which the line gila gura para machia- baithb is sung is strain A; B is the melody to which the rest of the line, gila gurapara machi baithepar a gail lapatai, is sung. The range of the B strain here is only two tones higher than that of the A strain. The sArangi interludes are variations on these strains or on parts of them. The range is only a fifth. While I cannot attribute the tune of the song to any local genre with certainty, in its minor scale and its simplicity it is like a kajalf, the monsoon season song sung in participatory fashion (see Henry 1981:A6). The second version of the song was recorded in April 1978, from Abul Hassan in Khalsa, Azamgarh District. Apparently because I recorded him in his home village he did not use his mendicant name. The melody of this version is similar to the melody of the first version primarily in two respects. In the A part the melodic motif is basically the same as that of the first song. In the first version it begins on the minor third, descends to the second, rises very briefly to the minor third and descends through the second to the tonic. The same descent from minor third to tonic is seen in the second version of</page><page sequence="7">Transposed up one octave and one semi-tone. (2)= Sarangi, sounding one octave higher than written.

Secondly, the A strain in both versions alternates with a B strain, but the B parts of the two versions are entirely different. In the second song there is also alternation between regular beat and free rhythm. Except for the introduction, the first strain is always sung to the beat, with the saratigi drone sometimes being played squarely off the beat (not an unusual practice among these singers), giving a very propulsive rhythmic drive. The second, higher strain is sung in free rhythm; the return to the A strain, with its regular beat, is dramatic. (It is even more welcome in this case because the singer, apparently out of practice, was at the ragged limit of his vocal range on the antara. The transcription belies a shaky performance.) This kind of alternation between free rhythm and regular beat found in some nirgun bhajans is common in the popular ghhazal (such as those heard on Ghazals to Remember, The Gramophone Company of India, ECLP 2468 by K. L. Saigal, Mohd. Rafi and others) and is also heard in the performance of qawwafl and biraba in this region. I would speculate that the tune of this song derives in large part from that of a qawwali. This presents the possibility that the first version of the tune could be a musical "parochialization," to use McKim Marriott's apt term, that is, ". . . a reduction to less systematic ... [and here, less distinctive] dimensions" (1955:199-200). The third version of the song was sung in a very plaintive style by a man who called himself Rajaman, on the road outside the village of Khalsa in January 1990, as he was beginning his mendicant trek. This is in most respects the simplest version of the song. Here there is no vocal alap, and the song has only one melodic strain, employing the major, rather than the minor third. The structure of the melody, sung entirely in free rhythm, owes nothing to any other local genre known to me-if there is a melodic style associated only with nirgun bhajan, this is it. The only elaboration not previously seen is the use of the sarafigi to provide brief interjections within the sung line, a technique employed with great skill by Jogi Meghu Sai, as seen in the next song. (JogiJan Mohammad, another very talented performer from Khalsa, also has developed this technique to a high degree; see Henry 1988:306-10). The fact that variants of this song text have been sung to three different melodies shows that the text is tied to no particular tune and singers can compose tunes or use existing tunes, variations or parts of them; the tunes are only vehicles for the text. Although it appears that there may be some genetic connection between versions two and one, the last version certainly shows no evolutionary relationship with either of them. The musical sophistication of the next song contrasts noticeably with the previous ones.

It is more accurately called a philosophical song than a devotional hymn of the formless divine. The rhetorical strategy of this song is identical to that of the song "Ocean of Mercy" (Henry 1988a:181-82): the anonymous author has selected and interpreted episodes from a broad spectrum of Hindu mythology to support the argument. In the ironically titled "Ocean of Mercy" the argument was against the existence of a merciful deity; here the argument is in favor of predestination. The text is: For fate gone bad what can contrivance do? Dasarath shot the arrow thinking there to be a deer. Sravan's death had come; what could the arrow do?</page><page sequence="11">Jogis and Nirgun Bhajans in Bhojpuri-Speaking India 231 If it's in the destiny, what can contrivance do? If the king is enraged, what can the minister 'do? If jail is written, what can the shackles do? Kabir lived in KSI to practice devotion. It was written that his death would be in Magah; what can Kai do? If it's in the destiny, what can contrivance do? King Dasarath, in the second line, accidently shot ~rAvan while hunting in the forest (from the myth of Sravan Kumar, said by informants to be contained in the Ramayana and Bhagavata Purana). In line 7, it is said that people who die in KsI (Varanasi) attain salvation, while people who die in Magahar are reborn as asses. Kabir was said to have left Ka"i to go to Magahar to die, defying conventional, priest-supporting norms. The grace notes and rapidly executed ornaments of the introduction set the pace. The clear use of both minor and major thirds and sevenths is unusual for this genre, and adds to the sophistication of the piece. One melodic component of the song that has turned up in a few songs sung by otherJogis is the use of a repeated melodic, lyrical and rhythmic "hook" that ascends to and ends on the tonic with a firm sense of resolution, a feeling like that produced in Hindustani classical music when the improvised melody ends on the sam, the first beat of the metric cycle. The hook appears first in line 3, p. 1 of Musical Example 4 with the lyrics taq(a)dir(a) kya(a) kare, the last syllable set to the higher tonic, and the sequence of the principal intervals 5661'. -It comes again in lines 4, 10, 14 and 15 and at the end of the song. Jairazbhoy (1990) deems this a "sophisticated folk technique" (as opposed to a classical element) that for him is reminiscent of one of the MandI genres of Rajasthan. A knowledgeable folksinger of Varanasi, Smti. Usha Bhatt, asserted that the tune of this song had been taken from a qawwali. One might hypothesize that the sophistication of the music of this song would be linked with its philosophical text, that is, that the philosophical texts are correlated with the sophisticated music. That this is not the case is demonstrated by Jogi Jan Mohammad's rendition of the song "Prin, Panci, Ban JAi H~i," which is as elaborate as this song but carries the typical nirgun bhajan themes (see Henry 1988:306-10). Meghfi Sa employed another feature in this song that I have observed other performers of the nirgun bhajan using: the omission of the last word. This no doubt causes listeners to think of the last word, and serves to reinforce the text and its import. Charles Capwell has pointed out that it is also a musical device, the resolution of the last note of the hook (1990). The sthayi of the song is used for the hook/refrain, which ends taqdir kya kare?, sung to 5661'. The song has two clearly defined antaras, marked B and C in the transcription, the C antara being reserved for the penultimate line of text.

Such well- made songs as this prompt the question: who composes these songs, and how are they learned? Those Jogis I interviewed in Khalsa in 1978 and 1990 could only say that they learned the songs simply by hearing them sung around the village. The song texts, as well as the tunes, indicate that the nirgun bhajan tradition of village Khalsa, if there is one, is far from unified. Comparing the texts of "Hfra Ratan" That this is the only nirgun bhajan of which I have collected three variants, that I collected them over a broad span of time, and that I recorded them from three different singers, suggests the importance of this particular text, which I have come to think of as the archetype of the genre. It contains two of the major themes of this region's nirgun bhajans: the importance of</page><page sequence="14">234 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 devotion in attaining salvation, and the illusory, transitory, and insidious nature of the phenomenal world. Comparison of the different versions of the text reveals the importance of personal competence in the rendition of what we tend to think of as a standardized piece, as well as the substantial differences in wording. The first text is that sung by the teen-aged boy, the youngest of the performers. This text presented the most problems in the transcription and translation of the lyrics. The song exhorts listeners to strive for salvation by following the devotional path. 1. Having squandered the precious gem. 2. Having squandered the precious gem you have to leave the world, brother. 3. same as 2. 4. same as 2. 5. A wise saint will come and appraise the gem; it will be sold at a high price. 6. The gem will be sold at a high price; the wife locks it away; you have to leave the world. 7. The fly sits on the wet jaggery; the fly sits on the wet jaggery and its legs are ensnared. 8. Its legs are ensnared; there isn't the power to fly and in confusion, confusion he repents. 9. In confusion, confusion he repents; you have to leave the world, brother. 10. You have to leave the world, brother; the red flower of the cottonwool tree. 11. The parrot sees the red flower of the cottonwool tree and is tempted; the parrot is tempted. 12. When he pecks it the cotton will fly away; before, one doesn't do devotions. 13. Before, one doesn't do devotions; afterward one understands, brother. 14. same as 13. 15. Says Kabir, listen brother sadhu. 16. Says Kabir, "without bhajan there is no release." 17. Without bhajan there is no release; worshipping the feet of Bhagwan ("God") brings happiness. 18. Worshipping the feet of Bhagwan brings happiness; worship the Lord of Three Worlds. 19. Having squandered the precious gem, you have to leave the world, brother. The precious gem is life itself, which here is seen as an opportunity to earn salvation or release (muktz), through devotion. Having wasted the opportunity, one's soul nonetheless leaves this transitory world. In line 5 it isn't clear whether the saint will appraise the gem or whether he is simply being called a wise saint. Vivek means wise; vivekndi is not a word, but is close to vivecna, "to discriminate," which I have here translated as "to appraise." Nor is it clear whether he or someone else will do the buying. Line 6 seems to say that the wife (tiria) should protect the precious gem (life) by</page><page sequence="15">Jogis and Nirgun Bhajans in Bhojpuri-Speaking India 235 locking it away, but this makes no sense if the gem is her husband's life; perhaps the idea is that the gem is as precious as something one's wife would lock away. In line 7 the fly becoming stuck in the jaggery is a metaphor for the soul becoming bound up in maya. My informants agreed that pasata! should be pacatai, "regret or repent," and that the singer had erred in his choice of words. Line 11 states that the rewards promised by the tempting red flower are illusory and evanescent-they float away like cotton filaments in the wind. In line 13 nam a nam suggests chanting the name of God: doing devotions, the means to salvation in this religion. If this isn't done, one will come to understand the consequences later, the song states. The phrase agawa nam caran sukha dai in line 17 is problematic; my informants indicated it would make more sense if agawa were Bhagwan. Clearly this singer did not correctly hear, understand, or refashion the text, resulting in phrases that don't make good sense. The second version of the song employs the same three images-the saint, the stuck fly, and the tempting flower-but with more clarity. 1. Now someone squanders the diamond and leaves the world, brother. 2. Keep the precious diamond with care; lock it up! 3. Today some saint-buyer will come; the diamond will be sold at a high price. 4. The fly sits down on the wet molasses; his leg gets stuck. 5. Then he hasn't the power to escape; in confusion he will die. 6. You have to leave the world brother. 7. The parrot stays in the forest of cottonwool trees; Look brother! 8. Then he hasn't the power to escape; in confusion he will die. 9. You have to leave the world, brother. 10. Says Kabir: listen, brother sadhu. 11. Concentrate on your devotions; salvation is not achieved without devotions. 12. Life will be spent in vain. 13. You have to leave the world, brother. Comparing this text with the first one, in line 3 the appraising saint (sant vivekana) has become the saint-seller (santgahakiya). In the nirgun context the meaning of this line, "Today some saint-buyer will come; the diamond will be sold at a high price," was nonetheless obscure to me and my consultants. The wife (tiri) has been omitted from the lock metaphor in "lock it up!," obviating that problem. Here the final metonym for devotions in the previous song-nam a nam--is replaced by the direct command- do devotions. The text of the third version of the song is much like the previous one, but here the buying saint has become a wise saint-santa viveka. The line remains opaque. In another example of garbled transmission, "He sees and is tempted"-dekha lubbal in the previous version-becomes "Look, brother!"-dekh lo bha--in this version.</page><page sequence="16">236 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 1.

Without devotion there is no salvation; this birth is squandered. 17. Now someone squanders the diamond. In summing up the textual differences between the three songs, the distinguishing traits of the first song text are largely discrepancies due to the singer's lack of knowledge and understanding. The differences between the second and third texts also demonstrate looseness in the text and its effect on meaning. But although all three songs show considerable variation in the way things are stated, the ideas expressed are substantially the same. Thus, the Jogis' music is seen to vary in the proportions of free and regular rhythm, the amount of repetition, the scales employed, the elaborate- ness of the singing and the accompaniment, the form of the melody, and in the words and phrases with which ideas are expressed. Several factors give rise to this diversity. First is the differences in the musical backgrounds and abilities of the Jogis. Some of them have performed as professional musicians; others are only part-time mendicants, almost entirely self-taught. Those with professional experience, it appears, employ the tunes and techniques of the genres they played professionally. Those without that experience employ simpler techniques and the tunes of songs they hear in and around the village. Second is an obvious absence of restriction on the tune which can be employed, coupled with a copious supply of other music from which to borrow. This means that a new tune can be composed to suit a text or an existing tune can be borrowed from another song in or out of the genre, and used alone or combined with another tune or part of a tune. Such tune</page><page sequence="17">Jogis and Nirgun Bhajans in Bhojpuri-Speaking India 237 borrowing has been documented for a number of other genres in the region; the nirgun bhajan hardly stands alone in its musical heterogeneity. One example from music that might seem most protected from change-the women's participatory ritual music-is a song I recorded in a 1978 wedding sung to the tune of a song from the film "Nagin." (Film songs largely comprise the popular music of India.) The use of film songs is even more common in the entertainment genres. In his informative study of the entertainment genre biraha, which is popular in the Bhojpuri-speaking area, Marcus has stated that, according to his informants, from the later 1940s (and possibly earlier), poets and performers began to feel the need for greater variety, and began to substitute new forms and melodies for one or two of the units within the established biraha structure. In one technique "the poet selects an existing song as a source for a new melody; he composes a new text on the chosen melody, using the song's original text to guide the phrasing" (1989:98). As for why a singer/composer would want to use a film song tune, Marcus holds that "it was the perfect strategy for keeping up with the trend-oriented aspect of a modern popular culture: if a new song were sweeping the city (from a film or on the radio or records), within a week or two biraha singers would be incorporating that song into their own" (ibid:99). He observes that the technique of using existing tunes for new songs is a long-standing tradition in the region and was noted by George Grierson in his 1886 article (ibid:98- 9). (Grierson was an eminent linguist and the first Western scholar to write about the region's bounteous folksong.) Closer to the matter at hand, Slawek has written in his wide-ranging study of the kirtan (a devotional song session in which the individual songs are also called kirtan) that "the melodies of many compositions sung in a kirtan are borrowed from compositions sung in other unrelated contexts." These included "sources as diverse as women's participatory marriage songs and solo genres of entertainment music" (1986:183-84). He provides two examples of kirtan groups that used tunes from film songs, and for one states that, "they have set many of their bhajan (hymn) texts to popular film tunes with the intention of broadening the appeal of their kirtan so that members of the younger generation would also be attracted to the path of bhakti (devotion)" (1986:133, 152). Some of Slawek's informants attributed the tunes of some kirtans to the genre called kajal (also pronounced kajarn), but Slawek notes that the kajali appears to be "less unified as a genre" than another genre called purvi, and that although melodies identified by informants as kajal dhuns (tunes) are confined to a more limited range and exhibit a more convoluted melodic line, "the idiosyncracies of these tunes are not so strong as to distinguish them from many other melodies not identified as kajarn tunes" and that informants sometimes contradicted each other and themselves in identifying</page><page sequence="18">238 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 tunes as kajari (ibid:188). This accords with my own observations on the diversity of kajali, which has been both an entertainment and a participatory genre (Henry 1973:142). Although it is not known at this time whether kajali composers borrowed tunes from other genres, it seems likely. To return to the argument, although it is not clear for the kajali, the intra-genre heterogeneity of the biraha and the kirtan results from adaptation to a changing musical environment. To increase their appeal, tunes from a variety of sources are used in the kirtan, the biraha and possibly the kajali as well as the nirgun bhajan. I have proposed the term "genre drift" to refer to the regular performance of a genre by a social category other than that which originally performed the song (Henry 1988b:224). That does not appear to be a factor in explaining diversity in this case-the association of Jogis with this type of song has ample historical depth (Dvivedi 1971:24; Dasgupta 1969:369). Clearly, what is going on here, as indicated in Marcus' study of the biraha, and Slawek's study of kirtan, is simply that musicians, in large part to attract and please their audiences but also to please themselves and their fellow singers, set existing texts (as well as new ones) to new forms. What happened in American Christian churches in the 1960s through the 1980s, including both Catholic and Protestant churches, is not an altogether spurious parallel. A new corpus of songs was created and performed employing a variety of new formal traits including folk-like melodies and guitar accompaniment. This was done in response to the felt need to attract younger people, among whom "folk" music was currently popular, to the churches. One of the results was a much more diverse corpus of hymns. The principle underlying these changes in form and resulting intra-genre heterogeneity, termed "adaptation" above, is basically that expressed in Merriam's feedback model (1964:32-33). Musicians determine what and how to perform, perform it, and alter it according to audience feedback. This is hardly surprising for the entertainment genres biraha, qawwali, and kajali, but it is somewhat surprising for the participatory genres, in which performers are non-specialists focused more, one would expect, on perfor- mance for its own sake and/or to satisfy a ritual imperative. However, I have noticed in two different villages that groups of neighborhood women who sing participatory ritual music well will be invited to sing at homes not in their neighborhood. One of those groups expected a token payment for their services. And Slawek found that some if not all kirtan groups are audience- oriented not only in their use of popular tunes for devotional texts, but in travelling to other cities to perform their music for other devotional groups and even in devotional singing contests. Although they do not perform for a fee, donations, which offset the expenses of the group, are welcomed (1986:132, 152). Nirgun bhajans are more explicitly performed for donations</page><page sequence="19">Jogis and Nirgun Bhajans in Bhojpuri-Speaking India 239 and Jogis accordingly more interested in adapting their material. Although it is not known whether nirgun bhajans were ever sung only for nirgun devotees, clearly in both the ritual wedding song and kirtan examples the performance is in part oriented to an audience not of its own membership; it expresses an in-group ideology but carries an additional, entertainment function. As put by one anthropologist, "Ritual has a quality of being acted, of being performative" (Ottenberg 1989:57). This is especially true, of course, if the ritual is music. It is apparent that a ritual-performing group at some point in its career may choose to emphasize the performative, entertainment function. The degree to which this is done is variable, and may be a point of contention within the group. The proportion of individuals in a group for which the entertainment function is of primary consideration also varies from case to case. When the function shifts and the group becomes more concerned with the audience reception of its music, adaptation is increas- ingly likely. As music becomes more entertainment than ritual it also moves toward non-participatory on the participatory/non-participatory continuum. (See Henry 1988a:21, 149, for further explanation of these terms. Like the end points on many continua, they were originally conceived as dichotomous.) That is, ritual music which ideally everyone present sings becomes music performed for an audience by musicians whose product is sufficiently special in some aspect to constitute entertainment. Ethnomusicologists have long been concerned with change (such as Nettl 1983:172-86) and function (such as Merriam 1964:209-27) but have not paid much attention to change in music's social place and functions in complex societies--changes that are commonly linked with changes in music style. The shift in the functional emphasis of a genre--from a unifying, ritual expression of in-group ideology or a mere ritual requirement to public entertainment-is one of the most common functional transformations to be seen in the study of traditional music change. In the Bhojpuri-speaking region such functional change is even more conspicuous in the qawwali: the original genre is ritually sung at Muslim shrines, and the popular genre is performed as entertainment in wedding and other public contexts. In the United States two obvious examples of functional change are the performance of American Indian ritual music for entertainment of non- Indians (Merriam 1964:317) and the performance of African-American spirituals and gospel music for concert audiences. In complex societies such changes reflect the presence--if not the integration--of disparate, homoge- neous social units into larger, more complex and heterogenous societies, usually in the form of nations. In their new situations, the newly located genres take on an additional function: that of emblemizing their originating social group or its region. For other examples, one has only to look at national music festivals around the world.</page><page sequence="20">240 Ethnomusicology, Spring/Summer 1991 Appendix: Transliterated Song Texts Version one of "Hird Ratan" 1. hira ratana gawake 2. hira ratana gawake jagat se jalan ho bhai 3. hira ratana gawake jagat se jalan ho bhai hira ratana gawa ke jagat se 4. ab kol hira ratan gawake jagat se jalan ho bhai 5. ai hai sant a vivekna hira mahanga bikai 6. hira mahanga bikai tiria tala kunj lagai jagat se jalan ho bhai 7. gil gur par machia baithe gila gur par machia baithe par a gal lapatai 8. u pav a gai lapatai urana ki akti nahT he bharam bharam pasatai 9. bharam bharam pasatal jagat se jalan ho bhai 10. jalan a ho bhai i semara kathi ka he phulawa lal 11. semara kathi ka he phulawa l1 sugana dekha lubhai sugana dekha lubhai 12. marata coca bhua ur jai hai marat coca bhoa ur jai hai agawa nam a nam nahT ai 13. agawa nam a nam nahl ai pichawa samujh pari ho bhai 14. agawa nam a nam a nahi ai pichawa samujh pari ho bhai 15. kahat kabir suno bhai sadho 16. kahat kabir suno bhai sadho be bhajan a ki mukti na bani hai 17. be bhajan a ki mukuti na bani hii agawa nama carana sukka ddi 18. agawa nama carana sukha dai bhajan karo tiraloki bhajan karo tiraloki 19. he koi hira ratan se gawake jagat se jalan ho bhai Version 2 of "Hfrd Ratan" 1. e ab koi hira ratan gava ke jagat se jane ho bhai 2. hira ratan jatan se rakho tala kunj lagai 3. aj a! hii koi sant gahakiya hira mahang bikai 4. jagat se jalan ho bhai 5. gila gur par makkhi baithe pav agayi lapatai jab urane ki sakti nahi hai bharami mari jai 6. jagat se jalan ho bhai 7. semar kath ka jangala rah phulawa sugana dekh lo bhai 8. jab urane ke sakti nahi hai phulawa sugana dekh lo bhai 9. jagat se jalai ho bhai 10. e kahai kabir suno bhai sadho 11. bhajan karat cit lai bina bhajan ka mukti na bani hal 12. viratha janam gavai 13. jagat se jalii e bhai</page><page sequence="21">Jogis and Nirgun Bhajans in Bhojpuri-Speaking India 241 Version 3 of "H-ird Ratan" 1. ab kol hira ratan gawai jagat se jalan ho bhai 2. ab kol hira ratan gawai 3. ai ek dina ai hi kol sant viveka 4. ek din aI hai kol sant viveka ek din hira maharig vikai 5. hira ratan-ratan jatan se rakhau tala kunji lagatyi hai 6. ek hira ratan-ratan jatan se rakhau tala kunji lagai jagat se jalan ho bhai 7. gilai gor par machi baithi jab piv payar lapatai 8. gile gor par machi baithi jab pav payar lapatai jab urane ki sakti nahi 9. tab ram-ram goharal ke mar! jai ab koi hira ratan gawai 10. jagat se jalan ho bhai koi hira ratan gawai 11. semar ganch rahe lal phulawa sugana dekh lo bhai 12. marat conc ruwah uri jal hi 13. man pachatahi ab kol hira ratan gawai jagat se jalan ho bhai ab koi hira ratan gawal 14. jagat se jalan ho bhai 15. kahat Kabir suno bhai sadho i pad hai nirwani 16. bina bajan mukhit na bani hai britha janam gawal 17. ab kol hira ratan References Apte, Vaman Shivram 1965 ThePracticalSanskrit-English Dictionary, Third Edition.
