<plain_text><page sequence="1">Duality and the Kami The Ritual Iconography and Visual Constructions of Medieval Shinto Lucia Dolce Le discours médiéval sur les kami a produit de riches représentations iconographiques des divinités. Ces images mettent non seulement au défi l'idée reçue, moderne, selon laquelle le shinto serait une tradition sans images, mais elles témoignent également du fait que de nombreuses manières de visualiser les kami ont été expérimentées au Moyen Age. De plus, elles mettent au premier plan la variété des performances rituelles relatives aux kami, auxquelles la production de l'imagerie religieuse était liée. Le présent article explore l'iconographie du shinto médiéval en rap- port avec le développement du discours visuel de l'ésotérisme, et sa signification épistémologique et sotériologique. Il introduit une énig- matique triade « shinto », dans laquelle Amaterasu est mise au cen- tre, flanquée par les deux Rois de Science (myõò üftlí) Fudõ šfMb et Aizen %t%k. Amaterasu est représentée comme une déesse à cheval et elle est identifiée au Bodhisattva Asvaghosa (Memyõ JPÜ H II/ Les deux myõõ sont représentés comme ses acolytes, mais ils jouent un rôle crucial dans la construction symbolique de la triade. Cette imagerie se retrouve dans nom- bre d'ouvrages appartenant au courant tardif de ce qu'on appelle le Ryõbu Shinto et dans le contexte des rituels du Miwaryû Shinto Hfiîfà C'est une imagerie comportant plusieurs couches d'interprétation, où sont encastrés des mythes, des doctrines ésotériques et des exégèses du Yijing : elle est en fiait informée par les idées du yin et du yang et par la notion classique de l'interface entre l'externe et l'interne exprimée dans le Yijing, en même temps qu'elle cristallise des segments de pratiques médita- tives de l'ésotérisme. Une analyse détaillée de divers documents traitant de cette triade suggère que cette iconographie shinto était étroitement influencée par les tentatives de l'ésotérisme contemporain pour visualiser les différents stades et les fruits des pratiques rituelles sous forme anthropomorphique. De plus, cette triade pouvait être le point de départ d'un discours sur une « bouddhéité embryologique », qui s'était développé et répandu dans toutes sortes de lignées au cours du Moyen Age tardif. Les matériaux du Miwaryû montrent que ce discours s'est même prolongé jusqu'à l'époque Edo. A great number of medieval Shinto texts offer interpretations of the world of the kami by employing dualistic imagery. This peculiarity may be seen as an obvi- ous consequence of the application to the world of kami the basic hermeneutical pattern of esoteric Buddhism, which unfolds through a twofold mandalic reality (Womb/Diamond). Indeed this pattern even gave its name to the most representative medieval discourse on the kami, Ryõbu Shintõ Yet contemporary Buddhist Cahiers d'Extrême-Asie 16 (2006-2007) : 119-150</page><page sequence="2">120 Lucia Dolce documents dealing with matters other than the kami suggest that in the esoteric world of the time there was a distinct emphasis on representing duality and the effects of its overcoming. Such concern was articulated in a variety of conceptual and visual forms, informed by two paradigms. One privileged the imagery of the unity of opposites that draws from the fundamental Tomitsu idea of the interpénétration of the two mandalic realities. The other expressed the subsuming of duality through a threefold pattern, which had a Taimitsu origin but was broadly used, as in the case of the so-called 'combinatory practice of the triad' (sanzon gõgyõ-hõ ELMûîr îÊ) developed by Tõmitsu lineages. These exegeses disclose an effort to reproduce and actualize the notion of non-duality in the physical action of the ritual protocol, by incorporating traditional Buddhist and non-Buddhist motifs. They also created new iconographies. This study considers a handful of Shinto documents within such a hermeneutical context. It explores the way in which the discourse on the kami appropriated binary and triadic patterns and reconfigured them by using elements of the kami myths as well as of classic Chinese correlative thought (yin/yang ). The ritual dimension of this interpretative process is a crucial question that deserves more attention than it has hitherto been given. The 'reading' of the kami that we find in medieval documents both generated other mythological associations, and itself became a mythopoeic mechanism. By transposing elements of the kami world in the context of esoteric rituals, such readings created new versions of ritual patterns, ritual implements and ritual invocations which, in turn, re-signified and augmented the meaning of related Buddhist concepts. In these ritual narratives not only were the kami incor- porated in the Buddhist universe, they also became one of the concrete forms into which complex Buddhist notions, such as non-duality and the physical realization of enlightenment, could be crystallized and expanded. The ritualization of the kami thus consisted in a change of liturgical modalities, which dynamically redefined the epistemological and soteriological significance of the ritual itself. Indispensable elements of this process were icons and mantric syllables. The innumerable images that we find in medieval Shinto texts - drawings of kami , diagrams of sacred space and of ritual objects, and visual representations of concepts - give a sense of the performative dimension in which the discourse on the kami was produced. Indeed, many of these texts do not look much different from ritual collections produced by other Buddhist lineages. These images are not accessory elements of the intellectual rethinking of the kami world; rather, they constitute the interpretation itself, a visual episteme that often does not have a sustained discursive counterpart because it unfolded in a ritual framework that already possessed the general structure of the system. Such use of 'forms' was sustained and legitimized (both doctrinally and liturgically) by the esoteric context in which the images were conceived. At the same time, by regarding images and syllables as the actual and real form of the kami , it also bore a striking similarity to non-Buddhist notions, such as those expressed in the hexagrams of the Yijing J§8.</page><page sequence="3">Duality and the Kami 121 Medieval Shinto iconography This study introduces an enigmatic iconographical triad that is found in the late medieval Shinto corpus: Fudõ, Aizen and Tenshõ daijin (Amaterasu). Before discussing the details of this imagery, two further considerations on the features of what we may call 'medieval Shintõ iconography' are in order. The first characteristic that may be identified in the medieval production of Shintõ images is the focus on the personal and corporeal identity of the kami. The visualization of Amaterasu, for example, was carried out not only by applying the twofold mandalic pattern to the physical space of Ise, namely, by superimposing the Womb and Diamond mandatas on the Inner and Outer shrines. It was also developed in anthropomorphic terms, by creating a double mandalic body for Ama- terasu. Different sources depict Amaterasu as two discrete female deities inscribed in eight-petaled lotuses, sitting cross-legged, and holding a round mirror. One of the two deities makes the meditation mudrã in the guise of Dainichi in the Womb mandala while the other makes the wisdom-fist mudrã as Dainichi in the Diamond mandala.1 (Fig. la-b) Fig. la-b: Mandalic Amaterasu. From Nisho Tenshõ kõtaijin senkõ jidaishõ, Shinpukuji Archive. This iconographie development may be considered as a type of 'embodied man- dalization,' similar to the one that had been carried out by Japanese ritualists in the esotericization of other Buddhist elements such as the two Buddhas of the Lotus sütra.2 It stands in sharp contrast to the modern perception of Shinto as an aniconic 1 .

This iconography is discussed in Dolce, "Reconsidering the Taxonomy of the Esoteric: Hermeneutical and Ritual Practices of the Lotus Sütra, " in The Culture of Secrecy in Japanese Religion , Mark Teeuwen and Bernhard Scheid, eds., London &amp; New York, Routledge, 2006,</page><page sequence="4">122 Lucia Dolce tradition but it should be seen as a significant contribution to the representation of the kami that was being experimented with in the medieval period.3 Secondly, Shintõ images were not molded exclusively out of the normative model of the two mandatas. Indeed, unusual and enigmatic icons, of which the origin and function still need to be fully grasped, constitute a substantial part of the medieval sources on the kami.4 Yet if this peculiarity is seen in the wider religious landscape of the time, it parallels a trend in contemporaneous Buddhist discourse, where non-canonical iconographies developed and spread throughout the networks of esoteric lineages. One example of such 'new' Buddhist images was the pairing the two Kings of Knowledge ( myõõ 0^3í), Fudõ ^fSj and Aizen M These two deities were not present in canonical sources as a couple, but by the thirteenth century they appeared together in several documents and ritual objects, and in some cases the representation of each myõõ greatly differed from canonical standards.5 Furthermore, a new triad was created on the basis of the association of Fudõ and Aizen, most prominently within the Sanböin lineage of Tõmitsu, which incorporated a third icon in the form of the Wish-fulfilling jewel, Kūkai, or the five-element stüpa in the ritual known as sanzon gõgyõ.6 (Fig. 2) New Shintõ iconography such as the triad centred on Amaterasu thus needs to be considered in light of medieval developments of the esoteric visual discourse and its epistemological and soteriological significance. I have discussed elsewhere the performative nature of the Buddhist triads based on the association of Fudõ and Aizen, suggesting that they embodied different stages of the union of opposites as enacted in a specific esoteric ritual practice. Here it suffices to point out that this process was explicated by using sets of other opposites, most remarkably astral ele- ments such as the moon and the sun, and sexual elements such as the interaction between man and woman. The triad served to give visual form to the realization of the unity, which was in turn embodied by a distinctive deity. Ultimately it pp. 130-71. 3.

Private Collection, USA.</page><page sequence="10">128 Lucia Dolce Amaterasus identification with Asvaghosa justifies this pictorial rendering in iconographical terms. The image of Asvaghosa on a horse was created in China, where the Buddhist scholar-monk had been transformed into a bodhisattva and tutelary god of sericulture. It was probably evoked by his name, literally translated in Chinese as Maming (Jp. Memyõ JPIl), meaning "horse-neigh." Japanese ritual collections of different lineages, such as the Besson zakki BíKřÍHEl (Tomitsu) and the Asabashõ (Taimitsu), attest to the popularity of this deity in the medieval period. These sources depict him as a six-armed or a two-armed figure (depending on the ritual manual that the iconography follows), clad in white and sitting on a lotus pedestal, with one leg pendant, on a horse; in one hand he holds a scale, while the other hand(s) make different mudrãs.14 (Fig. 7) The iconographie borrowings of the image of Amaterasu are evident. But why was Asvaghosa, of all new deities, chosen as a model by ritualists striving to create visible forms for Amaterasu? Fig. 7: The bodhisattva Asvaghosa. From the Besson zakki . The ritual anthologies do not link Amaterasu and Asvaghosa, but these and other medieval Buddhist sources include several stories from the Chinese lore of Asvaghosa, from which analogies could be drawn with Amaterasus myth. Chinese hagiographies, for instance, praised Asvaghosa for transforming himself into a silk- worm to make clothes for poor people, where the Nihon shoki and Kojiki presented 14.

Curiously, Kakuzenshõ the major Tõmitsu anthology of the medieval period, does not include rituals for the bodhisattva Asvaghosa.</page><page sequence="11">Duality and the Kami 129 Amaterasu as the divine maiden who wove clothes for the gods.15 Furthermore, the etiology of the horse-head maiden (Matou UsS), the popular Chinese god of silkworms associated with Asvaghosa, narrated an account of a young lady enveloped by the skin of a dead horse and concealed from view. Similarly, Amaterasu hid in the Rock-cave after Susanoo Ä^§nJlÄ threw at her the hide of a dead horse.16 In both myths a (dead) horse is the cause of a female figure disappearing in a dark place, and this concealment eventually produces prosperity. Other stories also offer material for the identification of Asvaghosa with a Sun-god. One states that the bodhisattva transformed himself into the sun before entering nirvāna,11 and another says that he was born as Nāgārjunas elder brother and called the Sun Jewel.18 These stories clearly circulated among esoteric practitioners of the time, and constituted a mythological background which was fertile soil for the medieval interest in elaborating new narratives. The association with Amaterasu must have sprung from here. Indeed one finds evidence of such a mythopoeic process in the fourteenth-century compendium of Taimitsu material, the Keiranshüyöshü which records several new myths created through linguistic and visual assonances of apparently unrelated narratives. The Keiranshüyöshü connected Asvaghosa to the Sun deity in different places. In one entry the link is the horse, as the compiler refers to the bodhisattvas origin-story, compares it to the Sun-god (Nittenshi EK?) who rides eight horses, and concludes that the horses are the samaya form of Sun-gods.19 In another entry the link is sericulture: discussing why the 'Land to the Easť (i.e., Japan) is called the 'Country of the mulberry tree' (Fusõ-koku ft^®) the text sketches out multiple connections whereby Asvaghosa is the original ground ( honji ) of silkworms and at the same time is identified with Kannon, and this becomes evidence for the fact that the Sun-god of the Ise shrine abides in the eastern direction ( mokuhõ tKÍj) of the Eastern Land.20 These mythological correlations are a significant aspect of the medieval con- ception of the kami and cannot be overlooked. Later developments in Amaterasu devotionalism during the Edo period, for instance, similarly involved the worship of Amaterasu as the tutelary deity of sericulture, much as Asvaghosa had been wor- shipped in China and medieval Japan.21 The concern of the present study, however, 15.

In the following pages I shall therefore turn to an etiological narrative that elaborates on such ritual aspects. Amaterasu inside the Rock-cave: the exegesis of the Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu Ritual documents of the Miwaryù reveal that the images of Amaterasu/Memyõ, Fudõ and Aizen were used during a liturgy called "the initiation of the Rock-cave" (iwato kanjõ ëPSM). This was one of the variously named abhiseka focused on Amaterasu,22 which re-enacted the disappearance of Amaterasu in the Rock-cave. The Rock- cave was a crucial element in Amaterasus myth, and the centrality of the motif of its opening in the Buddhist discourse on the kami is also noteworthy. Indeed the myth lent itself to multiple references to other Buddhist 'openings/ first of all the opening of the Iron Stùpa, which is perhaps the most critical ele- ment in the mythology of transmission of esoteric teachings. The second chapter of the Jindaikan hiketsu another important medieval Shinto document, argues for instance that the Heavenly Rock-cave should be considered at the same level as the stūpa of Sakyamuni and Prabhūtaratna (i.e., the jewelled stūpa of the Lotus Sūtra ) and the Iron Stūpa of the South.23 The Miwaryù initiation that takes its name from the Rock-cave, however, seemed to focus not on the moment of the opening of the cave, and the reappearance of the deity in world, but rather on the time in which Amaterasu was hiding inside the cave - a feature underlined in the iconography surveyed above, which purports to represent the deity inside the Rock-cave ( iwato chüson). An elaborate and intriguing explanation of the icons used during the iwato kanjõ is contained in a secret transmission known as Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu.24 This short, cryptic document is of particular interest in that it employs the hexagrams of the Yijing to support the iconographical exegesis of Amaterasu and her relation to Fudõ and Aizen. In this sense it presents an interpretation that goes beyond strictly esoteric lines, and further study is necessary to determine the genealogy during my visit in 2006, and to Itõ Satoshi for kindly retrieving the catalogue information. 22.

It establishes the female identity of Amaterasu by playing with the character Ü, which means 'to hide' but also yin , the cosmological principle corresponding to woman and Earth. It then discusses the identity of the venerable inside the Rock- cave as Asvaghosa: When this bodhisattva appeared in the world, six hundred years after the demise of the Buddha, he was born in the eastern Indian country. This was in fact the second birth of the Sun-god (Nisshin B#), but it was not called so. Now the masters secret expla- nation has clarified that [Asvaghosa] is the physical form (gyõzõ IfźM) of Õhirume no mikoto ^B^H. This is why in the Kokinshū a poem entitled "Hirume's song" recites: "Rein in your young horse / at Hinokuma River / at Sasanokuma / and let him drink there a while / that I may at least see your back." The image of this venerable [Asvaghosa] is not the least different from that described in the poem, therefore the masters transmission speaks of this honzon as Hirume no mikoto.26 At this point the interlocutor, that is, the disciple being initiated, queries why Õhirume no mikoto is riding a horse while in the Rock-cave. The answer cites a number of hexagrams of the Yijing in the attempt to explain the nature of the Sun goddess: Tenshõ Daijin is the original kami in a female body. Woman is yiny therefore Earth ( kuny Jp. kon i$), ground (di&gt; Jp. chi iļk). The Yijing says: "Kun: What is great and originating, penetrating, advantageous, correct and having the firmness of a mare."27 It also says: "Its comprehension is wide, and its brightness great. The various things obtain (by it) their full development. The mare is a creature of the earthly kind. Its (power of) moving on the earth is without limit."28 25. It should however be noted that knowledge of the Yijing was transmitted and maintained by Buddhist monks, who also were, at least until the Muromachi period, the only specialists to perform divinations according to the Yijing. The trigrams seem to have also undergone a process of mandalization, as the example of an early medieval manuscript I have recently perused would suggest: eight trigrams were arranged in a mandalic shape to represent the deity of the eight- petalled lotus of the central section of the Womb mandala. In this context the use of the trigrams to visualise Buddhist constructions of the kami is not surprising. 26. Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu , p. 136.

It reveals the form of the horse that goes back and forth in brightness and darkness. It is also said: "A female deity riding a horse is the shape of the Sun-god falling to earth. Because both the horse and the female deity correspond to the earth, the virtue of the yang element [the sun] is lost, and thus it is eternally dark." It is also said: "Because the Sun-god rules in the sky, he is endowed with the virtue of the yang element. This is Heaven. The horse is the Earth hexagram and thus it represents the ground. When the Sun-god rides the horse, this is the visible shape (. sugata ) of the hexagram of obstruction (Pi 'S) of Heaven and Earth."29 The Yijing says: "In Pi there is the want of good understanding between the (different classes of) men, and its indication is unfavourable to the firm and correct course of the superior man. We see in it the great gone and the little come."30 The Tuanzhuan explains: "'The want of good understanding between the (different classes of) men in Pi, and its indication as unfavourable to the firm and correct course of the superior man' intimates that the great are gone and the little come. That is, heaven and earth are not in com- munication with each other, and all things in consequence do not have free course; the high and the low (superiors and inferiors) are not in communication with one another, and there are no (well-regulated) states under the sky."31 With this understanding one sees that the world under the sky is in darkness. The ap- pearance of Tenshõ kõtaijin when she abandons the people under the sky and conceals in the cave is this hexagram. This secret exegesis thus draws on the image of the mare in the second hexagram of the Yijing, rather than on the image of the horse in general (which according to the Yijing system is yang Ü). The use of the first two hexagrams seems an attempt at solving the gender ambiguity of the Sun-deity, which should be male as the sun-god, and yet is a female deity in the Japanese myth. Accordingly, at one level the Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu could be read as one of the many medieval secret trans- missions on the gender of kami.32 At a second level, though, the citations serve to support a cosmological and metaphysical reading of the visual image of Amaterasu, which at once epitomizes the dichotomous foundation of the world, and the union of Heaven and Earth, original nature and appearance. This concern with the com- binatory nature of the being inside the cave needs to be underlined. Nevertheless, the text also draws attention to the solution of communication between the two cosmological poles, which occurs at the moment in which Amaterasu hides in the cave. To endorse this point, it refers to a third hexagram, and to a passage of the Japanese myth from the Nihon shoki. Interestingly, the latter connects the horse that the deity rides in the ritual imagery with the horse skinned by Susanoo, which was the cause of Amaterasus concealment: I- Ching, Appendix 1, p. 215. 29.

Then Tenshõ daijin was startled and alarmed, (...) and entered the Heavenly Rock-cave (...)33 Then the text explains the meaning of the accessories that characterize Amaterasu: The scale that [the deity] holds in her right hand weighs the good and bad [deeds] per- formed by sentient beings. The sun disk in her left hand is the symbolic form ( sanmaya ) that reveals the original essence of Õhirume no mikoto. Having discussed the middle deity, the compiler of the Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu moves on to elucidate the secret iconography of the two myõõ that flank Amaterasu, resorting to an esoteric paradigm: Inside a moon disk [placed] to the left of Ohirume is painted Fudõ. This is the [seed-] syllable A. [It stands for] the eight petals, the nine venerables, the thirteen great as- semblies and all saintly beings of the original Womb [mandala] . In order to defeat the four types of obstacles and enemies and to get rid of the calamities of the country, [this deity] reveals his angry aspect and abides in the fire meditation. It is called Fudõ myõõ. Because the venerable-in-principle of the Womb mandala abides in the wisdom fire of the Diamond mandala moon disk, he assumes the threatening countenance of great wisdom. It is explained: "Tsukuyomi no mikoto is a male deity and thus he becomes the moon disk of the Diamond yang-àtìxy. Yet [the moon] rules the night, that is, it rules the yin. Accordingly, on the surface [Tsukuyomi no mikoto] appears as the yin- deity Fudõ embodying the Womb mandala. The surface is dark/jym but the inside is bright/ yang. It is like the hexagram of the cavern with its undivided [lines] .34 Inside the moon disk there is a true sakaki tôt tree. This indicates the original ground of the male deity. The sakaki is the tree of the 'accomplishment from which there is no return (...) The other image is the disk [placed] to the right of Ohirume. Inside this sun disk is inscribed Aizen. This is the syllable VAM , the five wisdoms and the thirty-seven ven- erables of the original Diamond [mandala]. (...) It appears with the body of Aizen myõõ and it abides in the sun, the principle of the meditation gate. Therefore it is called Aizen myõõ. The venerable-in-wisdom of the Diamond abides in the Womb mandala moon- disk and thus becomes the venerable of the great compassion that removes suffering. It is explained: "The Sun-deity is a female deity. Therefore it embodies the Womb mandala, the moon disk, a yin- deity. Yet, because [the sun] is yang and produces brightness, on the surface she appears as Aizen, the yang-dtity of the Diamond mandala. This reveals that the surface is yangbut the inside is yin. This is the form of the hexagram of clinging 33. Nihonshoki 1, NKBT 67, p. 112.

I think the text refers to the shape of the hexagram, in which two continuous lines are positioned at the second and fifth places. According to Wang Bi's 3E5® commentary on the Yijing this position of the strong, or yangy lines means that the yang force is not expressed externally but stays within.

A complex and sophisticated interpretation of the differences and interaction of two opposites is crystallized in the images of the two myõõ. It assumes an under- standing of yin-yang notions, ultimately visualized in the lines of the hexagrams resonating together as pairs. At the same time, it is aware of the relation between the two mandalic realities posited by esoteric Buddhism. Although the text follows the conventional association of Fudõ and Aizen respectively with the Womb and Diamond mandatas, it also highlights elements of the ritual iconography of the two myõõ that allow the elaboration of this binary pattern. For instance, by referring to a type of meditation that recalls the iconography of Fudõ surrounded by flames, this deity is made to represent the reality of the Diamond mandala that abides inside its opposite, because fire symbolises the Diamond mandala. Further, this interaction is translated into a kami figure, Tsukiyomi no mikoto, who is a male deity and yet in his name is linked to the moon, a yin element; accordingly he is symbolized by a lunar circle that contains the radiance of the sun inside. Also of significance is the inclusion of the sakaki tree, an element that is never part of the canonical ico- nographies of Fudõ. Yet a katsura (1É), symbol of the moon, appears in at least two other medieval representations of Fudõ, produced in different contexts: Nichiren's BM Kankenki (dated 1254) and a fourteenth- century mani mandara H/ē S3ŘS! held at Mimurotoji in Uji ^fê.36 Arguably the compiler of the Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu was aware of such precedent and borrowed it analogically, casting it in a shape more natural to the kami context. Ultimately Fudõ and Aizen appear to be placed in the Rock-cave iconography in order to reinforce visually and liturgically the understanding that the true nature of each being embodies its double. The final passage of the Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu introduces another identity for the two myõõ: Question: Usually the sun disk is [placed] at the venerable's left, the yang direction, while the moon disk is at his right, the yin direction. Why do now you [say that] the sun is to the right and the moon to the left? Answer: This is not difficult to understand. Since the Rock-cave signifies the Hall of the Inner shrine [of Ise] , these two assistants should not be understood as the sun and moon but as the assistants to Tenshõ daijin's Hall in the Inner Shrine. In the Inner shrine Tenshõ daijin is at the centre. To her right is Takuhatachiji hime If Since her true body is the sword, she appears as Fudõ. To the right is Tajikarao no mikoto ifo. His true body is the bow, thus he appears as Aizen."37 35. See hexagram no. 30, "Clinging (Ch. /z, Jp. ri íH)," which represents fire and light, and is considered the opposite of hexagram no. 29. The hexagram contains two broken lines in the second and fifth places. Wang Bi takes this position of the weak, or yin , lines to mean to be strong outside but soft inside. Cf.

Nevertheless it functions in the typical fashion of medieval combinatory narratives, where the focus moves from the cosmological, universal level given by Chinese or Buddhist references to the local-specific context of Japan framed by the kami world. The two Buddhist deities are transformed into the visual forms of two distinct kami of Japanese myth, seen in the geographic location of their cultic space. This provides a third layer of interpretation, which seems to follow naturally after the Chinese and Buddhist imagery. Fig. 8: Diagram of the Rock-cave altar. From the Miwaryüjingi kanjõ zu . The passage also draws attention to the ritual protocol of the iwato kanjõ by scrutinizing the specific position of the two myõõ at the sides of a main deity. While the polar use of Fudõ and Aizen is reiterated in their identification as a male and female kami, the pair is now inserted into a liturgical triad, another incarnation of the Rock-cave Venerable with her Two Assistants. Other documents confirm that the liturgical arrangement discussed here is that used in Miwaryù initiation rituals. Various collections of charts of altars and implements used during these initiations include diagrams of the space where the adept is to perform the ritual, such as the one shown in Fig. 8. Here the altar is called 'Rock- cave' and marked by a torii- gate, and the names of the triad are inscribed inside: Õhirume in the centre, the moon-abiding Fudõ to the left and the sun-abiding Aizen to the right. A note adds that Ohirume is the bodhisattva Asvaghosa and at the same time the Sun-god (Nisshin) and the deity of Ise, Tenshõ daijin.38 This position of the two ^ýjM) is the deity that pulled Amaterasu out of the rock-cave. 38.

Thus if the equivalences crystallized in the two Buddhist deities do not conform fully to the correlations of the Yijing system, they imply further significant influences from the contemporary Buddhist discourse, which are necessary to identify. Fudõ/Aizen, moon/sun: The binary icons of non-duality The interaction of mandalic realities, cosmological elements and biological opposites that are subsumed in the ritual images of Fudõ/Aizen emphasizes the binary grammar of Ryõbu Shintõ hermeneutics. The imagery developed in the Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu is informed by the mutual generation of yin and yang and supported by the classic notion of an interface between inner and outer expressed in the Yijing, but at the same time it unquestionably represents segments of the esoteric meditative practice. Interestingly, early medieval esoteric sources that attest to such practice already present a similar combination of themes. A short work by Kakuban ļtfŪ (1095-1143) entitled Secret visualization of sun and moon , for instance, is a case in point. It discusses the meditative process, the mudrãs and mantras for this practice, which clearly derives from the Putixin lun Slinit, one of the canonical texts of Japanese esoteric Buddhism, and it presents its dynamics as the "union of Heaven and Earth."39 Shukaku hosshinno's tFSíŽíSíE (1150-1202) Tsuiki iâf2, on the other hand, records a transmission concerning the honzon for a fire ritual (goma), whereby the goma is seen as the samãdhi of the two myõo : the visualization of Aizen becomes the wisdom-meditation of the inner goma , while the visualization of Fudõ becomes the principle-meditation of the outer goma.40 A large number of Ryõbu Shintõ sources reiterate the notion of the interpénétration of sun and moon exhibiting a similar hybridity of esoteric and yin-yang polarities. A thirteenth century document, Tenka kõtaijin honen in an entry entitled "The original pledge of the single-pronged vajra" {dokko honzei ÍÊíí^iÍ), includes two drawings, a waning crescent moon with two dots in the middle, and a full circle with a black dot in the middle. These lunar and solar forms are decoded through a double paradigm. The compiler first considers their correspondence to the two fundamental seed-syllables of the esoteric system and to political elements (p. 160). This document also gives a list of Shintõ icons ( shintõ ezõ #jÊ#ÍÍ^), which must have been transmitted in the lineage. The sub-entry "Buddhist images," which curiously starts with twelve scrolls representing the seven generations of Heavenly kami and five generations of Earthly kami, records several paintings of the deities of the triad: three scrolls depicting Aizen, of which one is called "Aizen in the moon disk" (Gacchirin Aizen); two scrolls depicting Fudõ, one said to be a conventional representation and the other an image inscribed in the moon disk, to be used in the Rock-cave triad, opposite that of Aizen; a scroll representing Asvaghosa.

The moon indicates the way of the vassal. At the mantric level, the moon disk of the mind [full circle] is the syllable Ay and the subtle radiance of the syllable VAM. The sun represents the way of the lord. At the level of Heaven and Earth, yin and yangy these [forms] determine the shape of all things as well as that of man and woman. The sun unfolds the meaning of the taizõkai , the moon that of the kongõkai. VAM is the water of great compassion, the mind dharma-body which encompasses all phenomena and all forms of consciousness. This is usually Vairocana.41 This exegesis is attributed to Kûkai, but at the margin of the page the compiler adds a gloss with his own interpretation, which consists in a further set of equiva- lences: the colour white corresponds to father and to water, and the colour red to mother and to fire. Such sexual, colour-coded combinations, which are found in several contemporary documents, including those related to the sanzon gõgyõ-hõ, draw on another canonical esoteric source, the Yuqijing ífeSKIS?. I shall discuss the implications of these correlations shortly. Another significant Ryõbu Shintõ work, the fourteenth-century Bikisho UBłl, compiled by a monk clearly connected with Sanbõin lineages, brings into play the different levels of esoteric hermeneutics in order to reconcile the apparent contra- dictions of the binary imagery: If one considers [these matters] at the level of superficial and abbreviated meaning, Fudõ embodies the Womb mandala and the Inner shrine [of Ise] and Aizen the Diamond mandala and the Outer shrine. According to the profound and secret meaning, however, when the sun and moon disks come together, the moon disk is Fudõ and the Outer Shrine. The moon, symbolising wisdom, is the surface, the sword of Fudõ. The sun is Aizen and the Inner Shrine. The Womb mandala, being the principle, is the core, the vase on which Aizen sits. These two disks are Fudõ and Aizen in their living body (. shõjin Fudõ Aizen ... The living bodies before your eyes are the three luminous heavenly princes (sankõ tenshi H)1á^í).42 The Bikisho turns to the implements of the conventional iconography of Fudõ and Aizen, and it identifies the two myõõ with the two deities of the Inner and Outer shrines of Ise, rather than with minor kami related to Amaterasus myth. The imagery developed in this text has broader ramifications and links to a variety of other medieval ideas. For instance, it defines Fudõ and Aizen as deities appearing 41. Tenka kõtaijin hon' en, p. 332-3 [photographie reproduction], p. 512 [edited text]. This 'pledge' seems to be the first of a ten-step process embodied in various esoteric tools/Buddhas, and may correspond to the first stage of gestation in an embryological metaphor used to illustrate Buddhist practice. In another document I shall mention below, the Shinto daiji (see n. 49), the same symbolic associations are in fact explicitly made to correspond to the ten stages of gestation. 42. Bikishoy pp. 506-7. I am grateful to Iyanaga Nobumi for this reference.

What happens inside the Rock-cave? Generative polarities and ritual birth By focusing on the realization of non-duality that takes place through the dynamic interpénétration of inner and outer, sun and moon, Fudõ and Aizen, the sources analysed in the previous sections seem to downplay the meaning of Amaterasu as the central element of the triad in the iwato initiation. Yet, if one considers the exegesis of the Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu as part of a comprehensive liturgical programme, the same collection in which this transmission is included offers further grounds for reconsidering the discourse on duality within a broader hermeneutical framework that highlights the generative process started by two opposites. In this process the icon of Amaterasu inside the Rock-cave plays a distinct role. One of the transmissions following the Ama no sekkutsu kuketsu , listed as Kanjõ tashu no koto illustrates this point with a series of five diagrams, each focused on a specific geometric shape or figure. (Fig. 9a-e) The first three diagrams reproduce a circle, a ship-like shape, and a three-pointed shape (a half moon with a jewel-like object on the top); the fourth consists of a five-element stūpašy and the last is the figure of a man sitting crossed-legged and forming a mudrã. Each of these forms is identified with one sound of the fivefold seed-syllable A&gt; one of the five Buddhas of the Diamond mandala and one of the ritual steps of the initiation proto- col, according to different levels of association.44 The diagrams are said to represent the stages of an initiation, which is due to take place in one night, and correspond to the five stages of gestation of a fetus within the womb. Through this initiatory ritual the adept is expected to quickly achieve the ultimate enlightenment with his body born from mother and father. This one-night initiation is further presented as the most important matter of the sùtras, and the essential matter of the esoteric schools ( misshü $5 m). 45 The document thus provides us with a significant example of embryonic buddhahood applied to the context of kami practices. This 'spiritual gestation' is performed through specific movements of the body in the kami ritual space ("exiting the hall") and the utterance of a seed-syllable, is sustained by the ontological and cosmological meaning of the mandalic buddhas, and is ultimately crystallized in a body, which is a human body, the body of the practitioner, and at the same time the perfected body of enlightenment. 43.

A similar set of diagrams is included in the Ise shoshõ Nihongi ushiki honshõ nin denki CftfB, a fascinating exegesis of the two ideograms that compose the name 'Ise,' whereby the two ideograms function as the foundation of the binary opposition man/woman and of their union. The five figures in this document inscribe seed- syllables, and this clarifies the correspondence of each symbolic form and ritual</page><page sequence="22">140 Lucia Dolce segment to a specific stage of gestation. The first figure, the circle, contains two identical syllables A and the ideograms for white' and 'red.' The text explains that these stand for the fluids that are united during the sexual intercourse, and that this process is both like the coming together of Heaven and Earth to bring energy and merits, and like the true body of Dainichi, which is represented by the two maņdalas. The ship-like figure inscribes the syllable A and VAMy thereby represent- ing the diversification that takes place during the second stage of gestation. The three-pointed figure inscribes a syllabic triad, consisting of the syllables A and VAM at the sides, and the syllable HUM in the centre. This suggests the conception of a third being (the head and the two hands). According to a gloss, this stage cor- responds to the third seven-day period of development of a fetus, roughly, the third month in the womb. The fourth figure, the stüpa, inscribes the seed-syllables of the five elements, and is said to correspond to a formed body, i.e., a fetus in its fourth seven-day period.46 Finally, the bodily figure that concludes the set is depicted as emerging from two syllables Ay once again equated to red and white. The text thus emphasizes that the newly-born body is a human body made of flesh and bones (red and white) and yet, since it abides in a non-differentiated reality (the double seed-syllable A), at the same time it is the perfect body of the Buddha. The union of the two fluids, of father and mother, is presented as the twofold Dainichi who abides in the body of sentient beings, and as the deity of Ise attaining buddhahood in her own body. The newly born body is said to be the original nature of Ise.47 46. The five seven-days periods described in the text embody the epigenetic model of fetal development presented in Indian medical and Buddhist literature. Japanese sources often identified the five stages with the Indian terms of kalala (Jap. kararan $§Í!JÍ£), abhuda ( abudon pěšin (heishi Wi^.ghana ( kennan $t$f) and prasãkha ( harashakya ££$HH£), found also in Vasubhandu's Commentary on the Abhidharmakoia. These indicated periods lasting one week each. Medieval Japanese material further suggests that each of these seven-day periods was commonly associated with one month of gestation. According to Indian narratives the fetus was regarded as completely formed in the fifth month. This partly explains the imagery used in medieval Japanese texts, both in the five-stage and ten-month schemes, whereby the shape of a human being first appears at the fifth stage/month of conception. Japanese scholars have also pointed to the correspondence between these seven-day periods and the seven-day cycle of the rites of commemorations for the dead (Nakamura Kazuki "'Tainai jûgatsu no zu no shisõshiteki tenkai" Iwate daigaku kyõiku gakubu kenkyü nenpõ 50, 1 (1990) pp. 23-36).

Other Ryõbu Shintõ sources, such as the Tenchi kanjõki and the Shintõ daiji WíibMř,49 elaborate on the meaning of this syllable, which epitomizes the non-duality of binary opposites: the two maņdalas, Heaven and Earth, kami and buddhas, kami and human beings, man and woman.

The Ise daijingū mizu kashiwa chinju Sengū himon for instance, fashions the discussion of non-duality around the combination of Fudõ and Aizen, and eventually suggests that their ultimate reconciliation is expressed by the seed-syllables of the five-element stūpa.51 48.

It may be noted that the latter was pervasive in the medieval representation of Buddhist realization. While the theory of reproduction in five stages is a classic Buddhist motif, which draws on Indian medical knowledge and may already be found in the Abhidharmakosay in Japan it was applied to esoteric Buddhist practice only from the twelfth century. Kakuban probably was the first to implement it, and other contemporary scholar-monks developed it in the exegeti- cal context of the Yuqijing. Indeed early medieval commentaries on this Chinese apocryphal sùtra, such as the Yugikyõ hiketsu ÍŘSKíSSiíŽfe attributed to Jichiun Jf)S (1106-60), and the Yugikyõ kenmon by Enni Bennen (1202-80), contain 'embryological diagrams' identical to those examined above.52 This imagery spread across lineages, and it appears further in a fourteenth-century document compiled by Sanbõin lineages, the Sekishitsu 5Ü,53 and in a long commentary on the Yuqi jing transmitted in the Töfukuji lineage, the Taimitsu keigushõ (Fig. 11) Hence it is hardly surprising that it became intrinsic to the discourse on ritual realization carried out in Ryõbu material. inside a moon-disk, along with a moon-tree and a human figure.

From Taimitsu keigushõ , Eizan bunko. The performative context of medieval Shintõ eventually sheds light on why the Amaterasu triad examined in this study abides in the Rock- cave. As yet another transmission related to the iwato kanjõ &gt; included in the Tenchi kanjõki , irrevocably states, the Rock-cave is a mothers womb: "Amaterasu concealed herself within it, holding in her arms sun and moon. This alludes to our status, when in the womb the fluids of mother and father mix." The seed-syllables uttered during the ritual are the breathing of mother and father during the intercourse. The moment in which Amaterasu peeps out of the cave is symbolized by the syllable A , for this syllable is the fundamental non-originated sound that is the origin of all things. The utterance of A is the first cry at birth: at that moment the body is complete, at that point the practitioner becomes the body of Amaterasu.55 The Rock-cave thus functions as the natural, primordial setting in which the practitioner can experi- ence and ritually partake in a cosmic birth, by re-enacting the gestation that takes place inside the Rock-cave with the mantras, mudrãs and visualizations proper to esoteric ritual. The process of the creation of a human being becomes the secret meditative practice of the adept. Accordingly, Amaterasu inside the Rock-cave is a pivotal figure, which sets the process in motion by hiding in the cave and at the same time discloses its results. The horse-riding female deity portrayed with the features of darkness and light, Heaven and Earth, personifies the non-dual perfected body, cosmologically and biologically born out of duality, which the practitioner must aspire to. At this level of understanding the physical identity of the kami may also be represented by a 'body of practice/ This is, I think, the meaning of an image in the Shinpukuji Archives, simply entitled Shintõ #®.56 It depicts the dharma-body of a practitioner, 55.

Conclusion: Creative experiments with the kami The documents and pictorial representations analysed in this study are not comprehensive treatises on the meaning of Shintõ and of the kami in the medieval world, but ritual instructions that point to specific meanings and effects of the liturgical performances centred on the kami. They do not discuss the identity of Amaterasu and Dainichi, which is assumed a priori. Instead, they focus both on the soteriological process that is enacted during esoteric rituals and the outcome of this process, which they illustrate with a layered imagery that embeds within itself myth, esoteric doctrine, and the architecture of the Yijing. This ritualization of the world of the kami follows patterns established in contemporary esoteric Buddhism and brings the kami , their myths and their accessories to the level of the constitu- ent elements of Tantric reality. In this sense medieval Shintõ texts go beyond honji suijaku taxonomies and rethink the kami in absolute and metaphysical terms. Both the recourse to visual means, and the pictorial experimentation of newly created icons, reflect a novel stage of understanding the kami. Of the two epistemological patterns discernible in the documents analysed in this study, the triadic pattern seems to constitute a new trend in Japanese esoteric Buddhism, diffusely expressed in contemporary interpretations, and influenced by the Yuqi jing, a scripture which itself was considered to inscribe the union of the two mandalic realities. This model resolves the interaction of opposites in a third Osu bunko jingi-sho zuroku , p. 53, no. 66. 57. See, for instance, a similar image from a Kamakura period folio in the Kanazawa bunko Archives, entitled Rinjü hiketsu Exhibition catalogue Shõmyõji no sekitõ: Chūsei risshū to sekitõ Kanazawa bunko: 2002, p. 23 (exhibit no. 49). The goji gonshin kan is a fundamental esoteric practice to achieve identity with the Buddha.</page><page sequence="27">Duality and the Kami 145 element, crystallized into the physical characteristics of the fetus, symbolized by the cosmology of the stūpa or the jewel, and anthropomorphically conveyed in imaginative icons, such as the horse-riding Amaterasu, or the unconventional bodies of Kūkai portrayed in Monkan's Goyuigõ daiji WMa X^.5S In this context the 'Shinto triad' constituted by Fudõ, Aizen, and Amaterasu does not have a mere devotional purpose, but consciously exemplifies the dynamic process of ritual production, like the triads of the sanzon gõgyõ-hõ material. The solar attributes that in other medieval documents associate Amaterasu to Aizen are not directly at play here.59 It is rather the relation between Fudõ and Aizen that affects the triadic pattern. Once again this draws on the Yuqijing , for here Aizen is presented with its double, Zen'ai who in turn became identified with Fudõ in Japan. The sexual con- notations encompassed by these two deities in Ryõbu Shinto sources are thus to be seen as part of a broader rethinking of ritual realization, which in the medieval period was carried out ubiquitously across lineages, geographical areas and liturgical procedures, and was sustained by canonical sources. Although previous scholarship has maintained that the sexual imagery represents the marginal interpretation of the heretical Tachikawa-ryú, this paper argues that this discourse was, in fact, the 'medieval mainstream' interpretation of the esoteric religious practice. In a history of Japanese religions written at the end of the nineteenth century, William Griffis dedicated much space to 'Riyôbu shintô/ which he regarded as the distinctive development of Buddhism in Japan. Griffis identified Kûkai as "the won- der worker that (...) re-read the Kojiki as a sutra, and all Japanese history as only a chapter in the incarnations of the Buddha." He credited the "School of Yoga" with this achievement and pointed out that "Kôbô's smart example was followed only too well by the people in every part of the country." But Griffis did not understand the historical changes that informed medieval Shinto: "unfortunately the charac- teristics of this literature and undergrowth of idol lore are monotony and lack of originality. For nearly all are copies of Kôbô's model."60 A close analysis of Ryõbu Shintõ textual and visual material demonstrates that the medieval reading of the kami was extraordinarily creative and produced almost unlimited ways to re-conceive Buddhist concepts and give them momentum. It also reveals the extent to which the ritual interpretations of the kami incorporated current views of the process of buddhahood, which did not exist in the early Heian period. More material needs to be investigated to understand how esoteric practice was conceived, visualized and ritually performed in the centuries after Kûkai. This will no doubt shed further light on the obscure and unorthodox imagining of the world of the kami that gave shape to medieval Shinto. 58.
