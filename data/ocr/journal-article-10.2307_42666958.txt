Wigg-wolf (eds), Iron Age Coinage and Ritual Practices (Studien zu Fundmünzen der Antike Band 20; Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, Mainz, 2005). Pp. 418. ISBN 3-8053-3491-5. You wait ages for some new research on Iron Age coinage, and then two volumes come along at once. ... Thereafter the analogy with double-decker buses ends (although both, are in point of fact, red and weighty). The first volume, Die Kelten and Rom: neue Numismatische Forschungen , consists of fourteen papers presented at a conference in Luxemburg in April/ May 1998 and will be reviewed in the next issue of NC. The present volume has its origins in a one-day colloquium, Ritual Dimensions of Iron Age coinage , held at Durham University in June 2000. It contains 17 papers, which mostly fall into two categories; readers should also note that the editors also supply an excellent discursive introduction. The first four papers are more straightforwardly numismatic, taking coins as their starting point and working outwards; they all seek to interpret the symbolic meaning of the iconography of Iron Age coinage or their (mis)treatment before discard. The second larger group of papers concentrate on data derived from excavation reports and/or spatial analysis, i.e. the contexts in which Iron Age coins have been discovered. Both categories however seek to discuss how Iron Age coins can be linked to ritual beliefs and practices in the pre-Roman and early Roman periods in western Europe. Contributors include established academic researchers reviewing or building on previous research (for example Colin Haselgrove, Richard Hingley, Katherine Gruel), and recent post-doctoral researchers, for instance Mark Curteis and Imogen Wellington; perhaps I might be permitted to suggest that it is encouraging to see that the High Priests of the 'Cult of Iron Age Coins' continue to attract new devotees. Jonathan Williams' 'Vinous symbolism on British Iron Age coins' examines motifs on British coins which draw their inspiration from viniculture, the cult of Bacchus or the consumption of wine, particularly prevalent on the coinage of Verica. Williams has found more Bacchic representations than previously noticed, e.g. Van Arsdell 556 is not a plant or flower, but in fact a bunch of grapes. He interprets vinous symbolism as being an indication of an increasing use of wine in ritual practices, although he notes the puzzling fall-off in wine importation (as indicated by the dateable amphora fragments from Heybridge, Essex) which parallels this. (Yet another example of iconography/history and archaeological evidence stubbornly contradicting each other.) Williams theorises that the decreased availability of wine might have increased, through its rarity, its ritual significance (p. 38). An intriguing idea; of course Verica may have simply been seeking to stress his romanitas and hence sophistication by employing such motifs, beer being the indigenous tipple of choice (of Iron</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 325 Age hoi polloïl). Despite this reservation, this is a very stimulating paper; I particularly like Williams' paralleling of late Iron Age Britain and the Roman conquest period with the experience of Christians in first century AD Judaea (p. 38). Fraser Hunter's 'The image of the warrior' is neither straightforwardly numismatic or archaeological; it is also unfortunate for Hunter that one of the key publications which would have greatly enhanced this paper, Ian Stead's Swords and Scabbards volume, appeared in the same year as this volume, and was not available to him (2005), a fact which he himself bemoans. This means that Hunter is left with creating a rather uneasy alliance between the coin evidence, which gives only a 'partial picture' (p. 47), and what he really seeks to discuss, the evidence for the warrior in the archaeological record. Nevertheless the assertion that martial ideology - as manifest through images of warriors on coins, particularly on horseback - was a key component of Iron Age social systems, and that the warrior class may have had a hand in coin production, is an important point. John Creighton's 'Gold, ritual and kingship' is as thought-provoking as you would expect from this author (see my review of his undoubtedly influential 2000 publication, Coins and Power in Late Iron Age Britain , in NC 161). Gold coins disappear from hoards in the early Roman period, especially under the Flavians, and are particularly uncommon in the south- east of Britain; this is demonstrated in a chart and a series of maps. He suggests that gold is an elite form of special purpose money: 'could it be that the exchange of gold in late Iron Age Britain took place in a similar sphere of exchange, substituting for chariots and horses?' (p. 79) (note parallels with Fraser Hunter's paper), because he argues that the horse, being the dominant motif on the gold coin, can be correlated directly with its intended use, in a similar manner to the way in which the exchange of race horses is still reckoned in guineas (p. 83). So the 'disappearance' of gold during the early Roman period can be equated with the 'cessation of this sphere of exchange' (also p. 83). This demonstrates a problem of mixing up reasons for production and iconography - gold coins with horses on them could have been produced for the reasons suggested here - with the survival of hoards: the fact that there are hardly any gold coins in hoards of the early Roman period does not necessarily mean that a practice has been abandoned. So I prefer to take away the idea of a special purpose money and reserve judgement on Creighton's other conclusions. Philip de Jersey's 'Deliberate defacement of British Iron Age coinage' is more straightforward. Were cuts made to test the alloy or for ritual purposes? A tiny percentage of coins on the Celtic Coin Index have been defaced; two new hoards from Hampshire - sadly, both undeclared treasure finds - have extremely high proportions of slashed coins. Other forms of defacement include piercing, bending and folding (rare), and localised hammering (extremely rare). De Jersey argues against test cuts, because logic would dictate that the edges of the coins would be chosen, whilst cuts tend to be deep and deliberately targeted, e.g. across an abstract face. Ritual 'killing' is implied. Parallels are drawn with the use of anthropomorphic pots as substitutes for humans to be sacrificed (p. 105). My only complaint is that no mention is made of the idea that the coins may have been bent or scored to release 'their spirit' before burial, which is surely a possibility, and would suggest that defacement was not invariably a violent sacrificial act as de Jersey seems to imply, but something rather more harmonious with the material. Michael Nick's 'Am Ende des Regenbogens... Ein Interpretationsversuch von Hortfunden mit keltischen Goldmünzen' is a lengthy and thorough examination of deposits of gold 'rainbow cups' from central Europe, including an extensive gazetteer of site finds. Nick struggles to get to grips with what the large deposits of hoards mean exactly, particularly the 365 coins found at Wallersdorf. By looking at the geographical distribution of hoards containing these coins, Nick suggests that they demonstrate payments between different social groups, gift</page><page sequence="3">326 REVIEWS exchange in the form of marriage dowries and the formation of political alliances. This is not problematic, but does not explain exactly what the material was doing in the ground, because a distinction surely needs to be made between reason for production and use during the 'lifetime' of a coinage and the different reasons for hoarding and burial, which essentially comprise either deposition with a desire for later recovery (unsuccessful, on the part of the owner), or deposition in votive thanks with no desire to recover (successful fulfilment of a vow to a god). Nick suggests that the hoards were concealed under the protection of the gods, which is perfectly reasonable, and does not preclude later recovery (p. 145), but again is rather muddled up with his earlier suggestions regarding the maintenance of tribal relations. Andrew Fitzpatrick's 'Gifts for the golden gods: Iron Age hoards of torques and coins' discusses the evidence provided by 25 finds of torques (with useful gazetteer) which had been deposited alongside coin across Europe, between the fourth and first centuries BC. Sacred places like natural springs often seem the placement points, or man-made enclosures like that discovered at Snettisham, Norfolk. Curiously, Fitzpatrick does not mention high points in the landscape: Ken Hill (Snettisham) is a high point in a flat area, as is the location of the curious and spectacular sets of jewellery from Winchester (Hill et al. 20044), and also East Leicestershire (not mentioned, but similar; silver coins and a Roman helmet5). There is also common ground with the ideas expressed by de Jersey: the ritual breaking of the material before it is given to the gods. A 'store of wealth' for future use - the 'tribal bank' theory, which was proposed by Ian Stead to explain the mass of wealth found at Snettisham - no longer seems to have currency (Stead 19916); then again, at the time, the legal position meant that an 'intention to recover' had to be demonstrated in order to qualify the find as Treasure Trove, which meant that Stead thought it sensible to shy away from a suggestion that the hoards were buried as offerings (and thus not intended for recovery). Thankfully, the new Treasure Act (1996) has done away with this anomaly, and to a large extent has given more flexibility to researchers in interpreting this type of material, the need to argue for an intention to recover being dropped. The point is that Fitzpatrick's interpretation, that most hoards of tores and coins are ritual depositions, seems now to be the most widely accepted. Richard Hingley's 'Iron Age "currency bars" in Britain' is a welcome update to his important 1990 paper {Arch. Journal 147, pp. 91-117) in which he successfully vanquished the notion which equated currency bars with the 'iron ingots of fixed weight' mentioned by Caesar {De bello gallico). He does the same here once again, but this time with an updated gazetteer and inventory of discoveries. (The term itself is not vanquished, Hingley opting instead to place quotation marks around 'currency bar' to serve as a warning of ambiguity). Such terms become ingrained in the accepted archaeological nomenclature and are very difficult to extract once so deeply embedded. So the term is qualified: they were nothing in the slightest to do with the facilitation of exchange, at least between people, in an 'I'll give you one of these heavy bars for that goat' manner, but everything to do with the exchange of spiritual favours with the gods, being found on the boundaries of settlements (life versus death; productivity versus famine etc.), in sacred natural locations, the borders of settlements and the occasional temple. This paper reiterates the essentially ritual nature of 'currency bars', which are related both to 'the control of production... distribution and warfare [and] a metaphor of power relations symbolised in the productive cycle' (p. 201). Again parallels with Fitzpatrick. 4 J.D. Hill, A.J. Spence, S. la Niece, S.

He provides histograms which show that from contextual evidence there are more coins found in ditches and pits in the Iron Age than in the periods which followed, although his sources of data are not made explicit (I presume the data comes from his post-graduate research?). More successful is his reassessment of the evidence from a number of Iron Age sites in the south Midlands, namely St Albans (including Gorhambury), Baldock and Skeleton Green; all these sites demonstrate a tendency towards deliberate deposition at boundaries and in pits, and some have other types of small find which can be argued as being ritual, e.g. iron toilet implements. This reminds us that coins should never be examined in isolation; they are not a separate species of artefact. Less convincing is the analysis of iconography in relation to site finds, but at least it is an interesting idea that selection of zoomorphic types bears an inverse relation to animal types represented by the bones recovered from pits and ditches (p. 224). Imogen Wellington's 'Placing coinage and ritual sites in their archaeological contexts: the example of northern France' applies the theoretical concept of 'structured deposition' (principally Hill 19957) to sites in France and the Low Countries. Rather than looking at structural evidence for ritual enclosures, Wellington focuses on the artefact evidence coming from the sites in four study regions. Some are less productive than others; for example, the north-west coastal plain (Nord and Pas-de-Calais), has few votive sites, but western Picardy and upper Normandy have many. But the exact role of coinage is not clear; coins are present on many votive sites, but how they were used in ritual practice is difficult to pinpoint. As Wellington points out, 'more excavation [is needed] in certain areas to follow up the patterns which seem to be emerging.' (p. 245). Let us hope that this will be possible. Johan van Heesch's 'Celtic coins and religious deposits in Belgium' is a functional review of the evidence from Belgium which bears the hallmarks of ritual deposition. The criteria chosen are simple: riverine finds, finds from high points in the landscape, coins associated with tores and Roman sanctuaries. Sites include a small number of Iron Age coins dredged from the river Scheldt in Antwerp, the hoard of gold tores and rainbow cups from Beringen, and a number of Roman temple sites with evidence for earlier ritual deposition, such as Matagne-la-Petite. Van Heesch also includes an astute warning regarding the interpretation of riverine finds because of lessons learnt from finds of Palaeolithic reindeer bone and anthropological studies of Canadian Eskimos; these demonstrated that there are often very practical reasons behind the occurrence of reindeer bones on river beds (p. 256). David Holman's 'Iron Age coinage from Worth, Kent, and other possible evidence of ritual deposition in Kent' provides a more in-depth examination of the coinage from the Worth ritual enclosure excavated by the Dover Archaeology Group than that provided in his Britannia article (vol. 36, 2006, pp. 1-43). Around 50% are potins, dominated by the 'Thurrock type', copied from the Massalia prototype (see my comments on Geiser 's paper, below). There are also some other oddities: a Massalia bronze, and an Ebusan coin, which is of particular interest to this reviewer, as this is the first example as far as I am aware recorded in Britain; Ebusan coins and local copies dominate Campanian assemblages.8 Holman also draws attention to a small group of 58 coins from Stoke, near Rochester, which appears to be the site of a sacred spring; unfortunately the site has suffered from illicit metal-detecting. In addition Holman discusses the well-known site Springhead, which has, until recently, only produced a handful of coins. The Channel Tunnel Rail-Link excavations have increased the number to 76; the Kentish uninscribed series dominates (pp. 277-8). But unlike other writers in the volume, Holman remains cautious, despite the fact that he has spent many years 7 J.D.

Anne Geiser's 'Comparaison des faciès monétaires du sanctuaire du Grand-Saint-Bernard avec ceux de dépôts à offrandes découverts entre les Alpes Pennines et le Jura' is a short paper which looks at a set of about 550 Iron Age coins of the second to first centuries BC deposited at Grand-Saint-Bernard in the Pennine Alps, a temple site which in its earliest phases was a natural sanctuary, and in its latest manifestation a Jupiter temple built during the reign of Augustus (and now famous for its hospice and St Bernard mountain dogs). She compares this with finds from other Alpine sites: Berne-Tiefenau, Villeneuve-Noville, Marin-Epagnier and Martigny. What is unusual about the St Bernard material is that, in comparison to these other sites, it has a far bigger proportion of 'foreign' coins, chiefly bronzes of Massalia (modern Marseilles). Plus ça change - Massalia coins were clearly a hugely influential coin type, providing the inspiration for the British potin series, and a large portion of the locally produced coins which I have been studying at Pompeii (NC 165 (2005), pp. 377-81). But not just coins: at Grand-Saint-Bernard a La Tène sword was also found, and much of the material was located on the edge of the sanctuary. So it is suggested that these deposits are part of a collective ritual enacted by an army crossing the pass (p. 300); similar sentiments are expressed by Roymans and Aarts (see below). My only reservation is that this paper would have benefited from the inclusion of a location map and some illustrations of the main types under consideration, which would have given an intriguing discussion much greater clarity. Katherine Gruel's 'Etude comparée des découvertes monétaires sur quatre sanctuaires de la Gallia Cornata: Aliones (Sarthe), Bibracte (Nièvre), Les Bolards (Côte d'Or), Mirebeau (Côte d'Or)' again lacks a distribution map, but does provide line drawings of the principal types, and tables which list the numbers of coins represented at each of the sites under discussion. Most of the coins from these sites are of low value, particularly potins, as one might expect; and at Mirebeau, and probably Bolards, the coins are associated with ceramic deposits in pits and ditches. And there is also an interesting comparison to be made with Digeon (discussed below) at Allonnes, because in this assemblage 295 coins out of a total of 331 are all Tête diabolique potins, almost as if struck for purpose. Louis-Pol Delestrée's 'Les offrandes monétaires gauloises sur les sanctuaires du "Belgium" ' is a short essay which considers the 130 or so potential Gallo-Roman and pre-Roman sanctuaries and votive sites which have been identified in the area covered by modern Belgium, which during the Iron Age constituted the tribal, coin-producing areas of the Atrebates, Belovaci, Catuslugi and Veromandui. The article picks out a few sites for discussion (for example, Bois l'Abbé, Seine-Maritine), dominated with AE bearing the legend 'VIIRICVS'. But arguably the most curious assemblage comes from Digeon (Somme). This site has produced gold and bronze coins, and some of the bronze types are, as far as the author is aware, utterly unique to it (p. 331). This reminded me of the heavily die-linked Britannia issues from the shrine to Sulis-Minerva at Bath, which Reece has suggested were some kind of enthusiastic thank offering tipped in on one occasion,9 and indeed, Delestrée makes the interesting suggestion that batches of coins in the Iron Age were struck specifically as sanctuary offerings. So he suggests that coinage was issued specifically for the arena of the sacred, which he links to Druidic beliefs, a practice subsequently abandoned when the Roman period begins, in favour of issue for purely economic (profane) reasons (p.334). Or maybe it continued sometimes; could the Sulis-Minerva batch also have been struck for a special dedication? 9 R.

Coin deposition at the sanctuary of Empel in the Lower Rhine region' is a discussion of a group of around 800 Iron Age coins, dating from the mid first century BC to the mid first century AD, which were deposited at the Romano-Celtic temple site at Empel in the Netherlands. This is the region known as Batavia; the Batavians came to Britain during the invasion of Claudius, and sporadically were detached to Vindolanda, as shown by the writing tablets. Coins were ritually deposited at the site, as well as military equipment, and there is also evidence for large-scale feasting in the form of animal bones. I am struck by the similarities with the ritual deposition site in East Leicestershire near Market Harborough, which produced a large number of Iron Age and Republican coins, vast quantities of animal bones with cut-marks, and a Roman cavalry helmet (although what exactly the last object was doing there is difficult to judge).10 The authors suggest that these activities related to various 'life-cycle rituals' of the soldiers, e.g. when they were being sent to another part of the Empire. The god in question was Hercules, a syncretism with the native god Magusanus, who had similar attributes. That the deity was popular with soldiers hardly needs qualification. There is a large peak of coin deposition during the reign of Augustus, or at least large numbers of coins struck during this period. But the reign covers 41 years, so I wonder if the peak should be considered so significant? Is it not possible that Augustan coins were deposited in later periods, even as late and the end of the first century AD? (This concern has also been voiced by Sam Moorhead who has been studying site finds from Butrint, Albania, and believes that with good stratigraphie evidence it can be shown that many of the supposed coin-loss peaks, if created by date of issue, are flattened when coins are taken into a later loss phase: Moorhead pers. comm., and see pp. 287-304 of the present volume). David Wigg- Wolf's 'Coins and ritual in late Iron Age and early Roman sanctuaries in the territory of the Treveri' looks at four key sites in the Mosel, which is generally accepted as the tribal region of the Treveri: Martberg, which has produced thousands of coins over the years; Karden, the roman vicus of Cardena, just over 100 coins; Möhn, about 1,300 coins; and Bastendorf, almost 1,800 coins. Some of the coins, gold, silver and bronze, have been chopped or scored. Deposition concentrates around ditches and entrances to enclosures. Martberg provides the most detailed information: it seems that temple buildings were avoided, with deposition mainly being in 'ditches, posts, or open areas.' (p. 377). There is a thinning out of coin series during the first century AD; a similar pattern is noted by Royman and Aarts in their discussion of their site at Empel. Colin Haselgrove's 'A trio of temples: a reassessment of Iron Age coin deposition at Hayling Island, Harlow and Wanborough' acknowledges that there have been changes since these sites were first examined, not least the discovery of the ritual site near Market Harborough in East Leicestershire (see n. 10 above) and the re-evaluation of the central- southern British type series by Simon Bean, in which most of the principal sites in this discussion lie.11 Although Haselgrove welcomes the fact that 'ritual deposition' is now far more widely discussed and understood within the subject - it was certainly not when Derek Allen published his seminal reassessment of the British series12 - he correctly points out the danger of using the term because '[to] assume a religious motivation for [the coins] ... adds nothing to our understanding of the cultural processes at work.' (p. 381). A thorough reassessment of these important sites and their assemblages is provided, and will no doubt prove to be an important reference point for years to come. The conclusion highlights their 10 R. Hobbs, Treasure. Finding our past (2003), pp. 65-8. 11 S.C. Bean, The coinage of the Atrebates and Regni (Oxford, 2000). 12 D.F. Allen, 1960.

Hayling Island is the earliest, with Harlow and Wanborough having the most intensive period of coin deposition in the mid-first century AD, i.e. during the conquest period; all sites decline during Flavian times. This is an extremely important and very welcome collection of papers on Iron Age coin studies. There is a great deal of substance here; all papers laudably support the assertion made by Colin Haselgrove and David Wigg-Wolf in their introduction that 'it would be mistaken to assume that Iron Age coins were necessarily impersonal tokens in the same way that modern coins are.' (p. 11). The whole volume shows how far the subject has progressed in the last fifty or so years, and that the Cult of Iron Age Coins is alive and well. RICHARD HOBBS</page></plain_text>
