<plain_text><page sequence="1">S?tav?hana Terracottas Connections with the Hellenistic Tradition by Pia Brancaccio Literary sources and archaeological finds in India and in the West testify to the volume and relevance of ancient maritime trade between the Mediterranean and the Indian subcontinent during the first two centuries of the current era However, very little is known about the foundations of this maritime exchange before the current era or about its bearings on the S?tav?hana cultural region. Through a philological analysis of double-molded terracotta types from sites located on the western Deccan plateau, this paper highlights the major role that the late Hellenistic world, in particular Egypt and Cyprus, had in the developing Indian Ocean trade. It also explores the mechanisms of transmission of foreign models and the S?tav?hana response to this wave of cross-cultural contacts as recorded in the art of baked clay. The objects considered here are anthropomorphic figurines, lamps, and vessels uncovered at the S?tav?hana centers of Bhokardan, Ter, and Paithan (2) in the heart of the Deccan plateau. These last two sites mentioned as Tagara and Paithana in the Periplus Marts Erythraei (Casson 1989: 83), were referred to as major producers of luxury products highly desired in the Mediterranean world. * Some of the issues discussed in this article emerged in the course of my postdoctoral research at the Universit? di Napoli 'L'Orientale', under the guidance of late Maurizio Taddei. It is to the memory of my enlightened teacher that I dedicate this contribution. I1) The Periplus Maris Erythraei is certainly the most significant Western primary source to address Indo-Mediterranean trade. While references to this exchange appear also in other Western texts, see for instance Andre &amp; Filliozat 1986, they are scarce in the Indian literary sources, except for the Sangam texts dicussed by Zvelebil 1956 and De Romanis 1997. Among the crucial archaeological discoveries in India confirming the existence of thriving Indo-Mediterranean exchange are the excavations at Arikamedu (Wheeler 1946; Casal 1949; Begley 1996), the discovery of the Kolhapur bronze hoard (Khandalawala 1960; De Puma 1991) and the conspicuous finds of Roman coins from South India (Krishna Shastry 1992; Berghaus 1992). Unfortunately, not much survives in the Western archaeological remains to document these contacts, with the exception of the well-known Indian ivory figurine from Pompeii, first published by Maiuri in 1939. Recent scholarship has focused increasingly on the transoceanic trade that developed at the beginning of the current era; see, for example, Boussac &amp; Salles 1995, and Ray &amp; Salles 1996. (2) The first two sites were excavated and described by S.B. Deo (1974) and B.N. Chapekar (1969). Explorations at Paithan were reported in Indian Archaeology - A Review (1965-66: 30-31). [1] 55</page><page sequence="2">Terracotta artifacts represent unique repositories of information for archaeologists and art historians; they are excellent indicators of cross-cultural exchange because they reflect the technical proficiency of artisans and the taste, trends, and orientations of ordinary people. The S?tav?hana baked clay figurines from the western Deccan illustrate a uniform language of forms, a language spoken from Maharashtra to Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. All the specimens examined here seem to be locally manufactured for an Indian audience and are related in technique and style. However, they diverge from pre-existing traditional Indian prototypes and went out of fashion in a relatively short span of time. Scholars interested in East-West trade have underestimated the significance of these objects as indicators of cross-cultural contacts. The typical squatting figurines of the S?tav?hana period, such as the one from Ter (Fig. 1) embellished with Indian jewelry, are always depicted in a posture clearly linked to fertility and to the mother goddess tradition. They are not handmade, in the most common Indian craft tradition, but were manufactured in clay using the double-mold technique, which some scholars believe was introduced from the Mediterranean (Deshpande 1965). This method, which allowed for series production of terracotta artifacts and easy diffusion of prototypes, became very popular throughout the Hellenistic world, especially in Egyptian ateliers. If we consider the rich body of Alexandrian coroplastic art, we are able to trace examples not only technically comparable to the S?tav?hana ones, but also structurally and typologically related to them. The corpus of votive terracotta figurines from Egypt identified as representations of Baubo appear to be connected with the western Deccan images in baked clay (Fig. 2) (3). Common in Ptolemaic Egypt, these figurines depicting a popular character in the Eleusinian myths were used as amulets and were clearly related to fertility and devotion. According to the orphic tradition, Baubo assumed a comic posture, with open legs and genitalia exposed, in order to cheer up the goddess Demeter, still desperately searching for Kore {Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae: 1, 87-90). It is not surprising to find objects strikingly similar to the Egyptian ones in areas of the Deccan plateau that supplied export goods for the Indian Ocean trade. The affinities among the images produced by widely separated ateliers are so strong that it is almost impossible to distinguish an Indian prototype from one manufactured in Alexandria. These striking links strengthen the hypothesis that the innovative S?tav?hana fashion in the art of baked clay did not originate suddenly, but emerged as a result of contacts with the Hellenistic world. New models must have reached India with merchants who brought along objects of protection and devotion from (3) This is a mold of a Baubo figurine published in Torok (1995: pi. XCIX.183). Figurines of Baubo are very common in the repertoire of Hellenistic terracotta figurines from Egypt, where they also appear in various iconographic guises.

Brancaccio). their own land. It was not a trade in terracotta figurines, but simply a cultural interaction that occurred as a result of commercial activities and that found expression in fertile curiosity and exchange of ideas and technologies. The foreign models were selectively appropriated and recontextualized when they seemed familiar to the Indian tradition (4) In the same way, techniques and ideas were adapted to new sets of circumstances, and the process often involved a certain degree of innovation and transformation. Other figurines manufactured in double-molded baked clay, belonging to the category of auspicious artifacts, appear to be linked with the cross-cultural network considered here. The polished red-slipped rattle recovered at the site of Bhokardan (Fig. 3a-b)y in the shape of a very singular yaksa, reveals a taste for the grotesque (4) It is not surprising that portable objects associated with orphic rituals were assimilated and reinterpreted within the Indian context. The exquisite egg in alabaster found at Junnar by Dr Satish Deshmuk, Director of the University Museum at Aurangabad, is another example of recontextualization of an orphic artifact that lent itself readily to an Indian interpretation. The primordial egg is in fact a basic concept both in orphic mythology and traditional Indian cosmogony. This object was first published by R.M. Cimino (1994: pi. 10); both Maurizio Taddei (1998: 470), and Piero Guzzo, Archaeological Superintendent, Pompeii (personal communication), noticed at different times similarities between the artifact from Junnar and a comparable one, found in Metaponto, southern Italy, published by A. Bottini (1988). 58 t4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 4 - Soapstone mold from Ter. Lamture Museum, Ter. (Photo P. Brancaccio). quite distinct from that expressed by the indigenous Indian tradition. Comparable to the rattle is the bizarre figure incised on a soapstone mold from Ter, probably used for jewelry, depicting a caricature of a non-Indian, Western type (Fig. 4). The vast repertoire of Egyptian Hellenistic coroplastic art must be reconsidered, with its peculiar variety of grotesque characters having exaggerated facial features, large heads, and small, squatting bodies (Fig. 5) (Breccia 1934: II, pi. CIII.600). Such interest in caricatures was particularly notable in the terracotta production of Alexandria, where figurines were not intended to be clinical representations of physical anomalies, but reflected a general trend within the Hellenistic cultural koine of comically portraying various social groups (T?r?k 1995: 20). In fact, as Joan Connelly points out, Alexandrian society was essentially polyglot and multiethnic, and the visual imagination was often expressed in a theatrical way. Abnormal traits and exaggerated features were also customary in images associated with popular cults or myths in the Egyptian tradition (Connelly 1990: 89-92). Thus, the rattle from Bhokardan appears to have been inspired by representations of individuals with deformed features and irreverent facial expressions belonging to the body of the so-called Alexandrian 'grotesquerie' (Fig. 6). It is interesting to note that, much like the squatting images considered above, many of these Ptolemaic figurines were treasured as amulets or as votive effigies. [5] 59</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 5 - Male figurine, Egypt. Graeco-Roman Museum, Alexandria. (After Breccia 1934). Even greater formal and conceptual affinities can be traced between the Indian rattle prototypes and the popular images of the Egyptian god Bes (Fig. 7) (Breccia 1934: II, pi. XLIX.240), essentially an Egyptian yaksa whose origin and devotional tradition can be traced back to pre-Hellenistic times. Bes was represented in Ptolemaic Egypt as a grotesque dwarf with a large face, thick eyelids, and a big nose. Most often portrayed in a squatting posture, with a round body, short legs, and an open mouth, he was thought to bring good luck and keep away evil {Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae: 1, 107). It is very likely that small images of Bes, being talismans of good fortune, made their way to India with merchants challenging the natural forces of the ocean. However we know that In Egypt and the East, cosmetic containers were often made in the form of pot? bellied beings related to the protection of fecundity such as dwarfs, pregnant women [...]; kohl-pots may be found in the shape of Bes or else the vessel is held by the god squatting. (Dasen 2000: 96). Images of Bes or other Egyptian deities in the shape of cosmetic containers most probably reached India, the main source of spices and other aromatic substances often employed for cosmetic and medicinal preparations. In the subcontinent, at sites involved in the trade network, potbellied images were probably read as depictions of yaksas, and were seen as new iconographical means of depicting popular Indian deities. 60 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 6 - Grotesque male figurine, Egypt. Graeco-Roman Museum, Alexandria. (Photo K. Behrendt). Fig. 7 - Figurine of the god Bes, Egypt. Graeco-Roman Museum, Alexandria. (After Breccia 1934). Rattles comparable to the example from Bhokardan are also found in west Bengal (5), and their apotropaic function reinforces the proposed connection with the Ptolemaic Bes. The surprisingly large number of double-molded animal figurines representing horses and rams from Ter seems to further support the idea that foreign types provided fresh visual models for traditional motifs (Fig. 8). Although handmade clay animal figurines have a very long history on the Indian subcontinent, the realistic traits of the S?tav?hana mold-made images seem to have no precedents in the local idiom. They closely compare to Hellenistic types popular from Egypt to Cyprus and Asia Minor. In these cultures, much as in India, theriomorphic terracotta effigies, because they were associated with deities and sacrifices, were probably used as votive offerings (Dunand 1990: 277-78). Typological studies conducted on a group of lamps manufactured in Ter (Fig. 9) also disclose traces of interaction between the S?tav?hana centers of the Deccan and (5) Many anthropomorphic terracotta rattles from Chandraketugarh in West Bengal also seem quite similar to Egyptian images of Bes. See, for example, Bautze 1995: pi. XL.a, c. [7] 61</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 8 - Figurine of a ram from Ter. Lamture Museum, Ter. (Photo P. Brancaccio). the Ptolemaic regions of the Mediterranean. These lamps have been identified by Klaus Karttunen (2000: 933) as Tndo-Roman'; however, their particular typology points to Ptolemaic models of Egyptian or Cypriote provenance (Bailey 1975: I, pi. 104.Q522.EA) (6). The Ter lamps are comparable to the specimens excavated in the Ptolemaic levels of Tell Edfu (1950) (7) with a plain body and a narrow, elongated nozzle, or to the decorated ones from Salamina in Cyprus (Oziol 1977: pi. 131.115-116). While the simplicity of most lamps from Ter appears to be inspired by Hellenistic shapes, in some instances the foreign models are recontextualized. In two of the lamps uncovered at Ter, the handle is in the shape of a human head and the round reservoir is shaped like a body, thus acquiring completely Indian meanings, with evident reference to fertility (8). (6) Karttunen (2000: 933) also mentions that connections between the S?tav?hana lamps from Ter and the Hellenistic ones from Failaka have been observed by Margabhandu &amp; Gaham 1979; however, this article has been unavailable to me. (7) Similar to the Ter types are also the decorated lamps from the Egyptian site of Tell el-Balamun. See Spenser 1996: pi. 78.95. (8) Examples of lamps in the form of human bodies are also found within the Ptolemaic tradition. See Bailey 1975: pi. 114.Q604.EA. However they appear very different from the Ter specimen. 62 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 9 - Lamps from Ter. (Courtesy ACSAA). Perhaps better than any other terracotta artifact, the so-called 'Megarian' bowls uncovered at Bhokardan, Ter, Paithan, Kolhapur, and Nevasa (Begley 1991: 157-96) reveal the Hellenistic connection that distinguishes the early S?tav?hana coroplastic tradition. These mold-made cups decorated with lotus petals (Fig. 10) are Indian replicas of Western examples found throughout the Hellenistic world, from Athens to Cyprus (9). The chronological horizon of this type of ceramic in the West seems to (9) There is a surprising uniformity of shapes and motifs among the mold-made bowls produced at different ateliers within the Mediterranean. See, for example, the materials published in Massa 1992 and Siebert 1978. [9] 63</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 10 - Terracotta Megarian Bowl from Ter. Lamture Museum, Ter. (Photo P. Brancaccio). be very definite: production started toward the end of the 3rd century B.C. and ended around the 1st century B.C., with the emergence of Roman power in the Mediterranean (Massa 1992: 32). Scholars have suggested that the distinctive shape of Hellenistic Mega rian bowls was originally inspired by prototypes in metal or glass manufactured in Ptolemaic Egypt at Alexandria (Rotroff 1982: 6-13). The transfer of technology among glass, metal, and pottery manufacturing was quite common in antiquity, as all these industries used molds and treated raw materials with high-temperature firings (McGovern 1989: 1-11) (10). Were the Ter Megarian bowls inspired by ceramic models of Hellenistic provenance, or were they local reinterpretations of imported metal prototypes? No Hellenistic ceramics or metal Megarian bowls have been found in the Deccan plateau. Metal objects rarely survive in the original archaeological context because they were melted and reused in the ancient world (n). In this light, the discovery of a soapstone mold from Paithan for a small Megarian bowl (12), likely used in metalsmithing, is compelling evidence indicating the popularity of this type of artifact at S?tav?hana sites. The presence of a silver Megarian bowl dated to the 2nd century B.C. at a Dong-son site in Vietnam (Janse 1962) reinforces the notion that such vessels were traded along the Indian Ocean and were appreciated in South and Southeast Asia. Thus, it seems likely that a transfer of technology occurred on the Indian subcontinent, where expensive metal prototypes were translated into affordable ceramic forms (13). The many finds of terracotta reproductions of Roman coins at S?tav?hana sites indicate that during the first centuries of the current era the transfer of technology from metal to terracotta was a common practice in the Deccan region. The dynamics of cross-cultural transmission of models across the Indian Ocean still remain an open question. How did a Hellenistic motif like the one found on (10) For more discussion of the transfer of technology in the Hellenistic terracotta tradition, see Barr-Sharrar 1990:31-36. (n) The Kolhapur hoard of bronzes imported from the Mediterranean and dated between the 1st and 3rd centuries A.D. (De Puma 1991) is a unique find in the Deccan. (12) Mr Balasaheeb Patel was kind enough to show me the mold. (13) Vimala Begley (1991: 175) came to similar conclusions. 64 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 11 - Mold-made ceramic fragment from Ter. Lamture Museum, Ter. (Photo P. Brancaccio). mold-made ceramic fragments from Ter (Fig. 11) (14) become popular in the Indian subcontinent? While it is hard to imagine that ceramic vessels from the Mediterranean reached the Deccan in large enough quantities to transform local production and taste, it does seem plausible that molds with impressed patterns, in stone or clay, were brought to the subcontinent by merchants involved in the Indian Ocean trade. It appears that within the Deccan region, locally made molds were instrumental in the diffusion of pseudo-classical motifs. Several soapstone molds with Western elements, probably used to manufacture jewelry (15) have been found at various sites, indicating that within India the circulation of molds must have been a major mode of transmission of models (16). These small stone dies were highly portable and functioned as repertoires of new forms in the S?tav?hana context. The same dissemination mechanism might have worked on a larger scale: molds from the Mediterranean might have reached the subcontinent and found a fertile market in the new environment. This hypothesis would also account for the popularity of the actual double-molding technique in the terracotta production of the S?tav?hana times. Finds from the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, a region that was also active in East-West trade at the beginning of the current era, seem to support the notion that objects used as artistic repertoires had commercial value in long-distance (14) The vine scroll pattern is very much indicative of Hellenistic ware from Alexandria to the Peloponnese. See Siebert 1978: pi. 12.6. (15) For comparable soapstone molds see Postel (1989: 144, VI30). (16) Two specimens from Paithan, both in the private collection of Mr Balasaheeb Patel, are particularly interesting examples. One consists of a rectangular block of soapstone with the impression of a motif very similar to the one impressed on the Ter vase fragment illustrated here in Fig. 11. The other mold depicts a standing woman holding a rhyton. [11] 65</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 12 - Mold-made white ware from Paithan. (Photo P. Brancaccio). commerce. Inexpensive plaster casts depicting classical mythological scenes were found in the well-known Begram hoard from Afghanistan together with precious objects of diverse provenance. As these plaster models had no intrinsic value, it is clear that their significance relied on factors other than the price of the material or the skills of the makers. What made them attractive to the new audience was their relevance as artistic prototypes (Mac Dowall &amp; Taddei 1978: 257). This phenomenon was not new in the ancient world; molds and casts traveled very easily and were used as samples or aide-memoire also in Greek workshops (17). Western motifs were often ma? nipulated and recontextualized in the mold-made wares of the Deccan plateau, as can be seen in a white vessel from Paithan (Fig. 12) (18), blending together the Megarian bowl pattern with Indian as tamah galas. The use of white clay in this particular piece as well as in many S?tav?hana figurines of the squatting type, poses interesting questions, as it has no precedents in the Indian tradition (19). It is conceivable that the taste for white ceramic became diffused in the Deccan as a result of interaction with peoples of the eastern basin of the Mediterranean. We know that Hellenistic terracotta figurines where frequently covered with a layer of white slip, probably with the intent of creating the illusion of a marble surface, and often painted (Uhlenbrock 1990: 15-21; see also Andren 1966). However, it is also possible that the taste for white ceramics in the Deccan bears ties with the distinctive white-ware industry of the island of Cyprus, controlled by the Egyptian Ptolemies until the 1st century A.D. and then by the Roman Empire. The Cypriot plain white ware, descendent of an ancient ceramic (17) In Greek toreutic workshops, terracotta impressions very similar to plaster casts were used by metalworkers as aide-memoire (Barr-Sharrar 1990: 32). (18) Mr Balasaheeb Patel kindly showed me this object from his private collection. (19) In published work, the white clay is often identified as kaolin; see, for example, the fragments from the early S?tav?hana layers of Bhokardan (Deo 1974: 110). However, to my knowledge, no scientific analysis has been done to corroborate this identification. 66 [12]</page><page sequence="13">tradition indigenous to the island, survived through time, conforming to Hellenistic types (Tatton-Brown 1997: 46). It is this Ptolemaic and Roman Cypriot white pottery, decorated with impressions, that seems to be the source of inspiration for some of the white clay artifacts found at the S?tav?hana centers. Furthermore, similarities in other materials and shapes between pottery from Cyprus and from the western Deccan reinforce this connection. The possible involvement of Cyprus in the international trade in Ptolemaic times, never suggested before, is of great importance. As a major source for metals (Tatton-Brown 1997: 30-35) most requested in India, according to the textual sources (20) the island must have played a significant part in commercial transactions with the subcontinent. Moreover, Cyprus was an important hub in the Mediterranean trade system and thus an ideal place for assembling export goods of various provenances destined for the eastern markets. This brief analysis of double-molded terracottas sheds light on several issues related to ancient Indo-Mediterranean exchange. From a chronological point of view, the close relationship between double-molded S?tav?hana terracottas and the Hellenistic coroplastic art helps us better define the time frame for the establishment of trade contacts. Indo-Mediterranean trade was already flourishing in the 1st century B.C. The fact that by the mid-1st century A.D. an anonymous Egyptian Greek felt the need to write the Periplus Marts Erythraei (21), 'a guide for merchants' (Casson 1989: 8) doing business in India, and that such work implies familiarity with Indian sites on the west coast and on the Deccan plateau, confirms that profitable Indo-Mediterranean commerce was well established before the date of composition of this manual. The connection between S?tav?hana and Hellenistic terracottas also illustrates the primary role that Egypt and possibly Cyprus played in the Indian Ocean trade between the end of the 2nd century and the 1st century B.C. (22). Finally, this brief study indicates that the range of Mediterranean artifacts that must have reached the subcontinent was diverse; many objects do not survive in the archaeological records, but they left an indelible imprint in the terracotta art of the time. (20) As reported later by Plinius, Historia Naturalis, 34.20.94-3438.137. (21) On the date of the Periplus see Casson 1989, Fussman 1997, and Robin 1997. (22) The excavation of a canal connecting the Nile to the Red Sea under Ptolemy II Philadelphus in the mid-3rd century B.C. (Sidebotham 1986: 3) to facilitate the transportation of goods from Alexandria to the Red Sea and hence to the Indian Ocean, confirms the great interest of the Ptolemies in Indian Ocean trade.
