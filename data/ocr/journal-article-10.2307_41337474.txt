At the core of the work were a number of ^ records of insects by the great Swiss A Theatre of Insects, or How Nature Lost Her Morality Pamela Johnston polymath Conrad Gessner, a natural- ist, linguist, encyclopaedist and, in his day job, city physician of Zurich. When Gessner died in an outbreak of the plague in 1565 these notes were acquired by one of his collaborators, Thomas Penny, a Protestant preacher who had been forced to embrace a second career in medicine after the Archbishop of Canterbury adjudged Q As a distinguished entomologist and novelist do you find that your two main preoccupations condition , restrict or refine your view of the world? a What world? Whose world? If we mean the average world of the average newspaper reader in Liverpool, Livorno or Vilno then we are dealing with trivial generalities. If on the other hand , an art- ist invents his own world , as I think I do, then how can he be said to influence his own understanding of what he has created himself? Philip Oakes quizzes Vladimir Naba- kovin Nabakov' s Butterflies, 2000 1 Literature's best-known entomologist Vladimir Nabokov maintained a divid- ing line between his two pursuits, between butterflies and letters, art and him 'ill-affected towards the Estab- lishment'. For 15 years Penny built on Gessner's work, adding his own observations and drawings. By the time of his death in 1589, however, the study remained unfinished. In a sense it was impossi- ble to complete, as new specimens would turn up all the time - on fieldtrips, on returning merchant ships or in envelopes and parcels sent from his vast network of correspondents in Europe. Penny's labour of love would have perished with him if his friend Thomas Moffet had not come to the rescue, salvaging the papers as they were about to be 'cast out of doors'. Like Gessner and Penny, Moffet was a practising doctor. More than that, he was a leading exponent of the fashionable new Paracelsian system of medicine and, as Hugh Tre- vor-Roper notes, 'physician to the avant-garde statesmen and courti- ers of Queen Elizabeth - the supporters of the Earl of Leicester and a forward policy in Europe - Sir Francis Walsingham, Sir Philip Sid- ney, the Earl of Essex, Sir Francis Drake'.4 These courtly circles had instilled some refined sensibilities. Moffet expresses his horror at finding Penny's manuscript in tatters, 'full of blots and confused with doubtful characters'. And as he laboriously reassembled the pieces a worse blow was to follow: the confirmation of his long-held suspicion that his friend found writing torturous, with painful 'У/&gt;7 science. But the earliest entomologists, his sixteenth-century forebears, were not so restrictive. In the Theatrum insec- torum ( Theatre of Insects)2 - an anthology results: 'I ort observed |himj to be gravelled here'. It was up to Mor- fei, then, to add the 'light of oratory' that Penny lacked, to do justice to 'so exquisite a narration'. The official historiographers' verdict is that Penny is 'something of a pioneer - certainly the first Englishman to anticipate the Baconi- an insistence upon the collection of data as the essential prelimi- nary to theorising', while Moffet is his incompetent literary execu- tor, overwriting Penny's 'dry scientific precision' with his 'editorial flights of imagination'.5 But imagination, when the Theatre of Insects was written, had not yet acquired the reputation of an enemy of sci- ence, with the potential to subvert its hard-won data. On the contra- ry, an active imagination was encouragea, as it was the very thing that allowed you to see the bigger picture. Or, as Nabakov would put it much later: 'Whatever the mind grasps, it does AA files 63 37 Opposite: Grasshoppers from the manuscript of the Thea trum insectorum , 1590 © The British Library Board, ms Sloane 741/4014</page><page sequence="3">so with the assistance of creative fancy, that drop of water on a glass slide which gives distinctness and relief to the observed organism'. In the Theatre of Insects, Moffet creates a world of his own imagining - not a world of trivial generalities, but a whole parallel universe offering an escape from the bloody religious and political strife that was convulsing Europe. And it is this invention, combined with the rich seam of aesthetics, that gives the work its enduring appeal. The science in the Theatre of Insects, on the other hand, was soon outdated. Although convex magnifying lenses existed at the time, Penny appears not to have used one. Instead this was a nano-world investigated only with the naked eye. There is also the small problem of the persistence of the ancient belief in spontaneous generation. Penny tells us that caterpillars come from the eggs of butterflies, but Moffet adds that there is no reason why they cannot also be bred from dew. Or that scorpions are generated two ways: most commonly by copulation, but also, just occasionally, by the putrefaction of an otherwise fragrant herb - as was the case with an 'Italian that delighted much in the smell of basil', who allegedly bred a scorpion in his brain. The slow erosion of the principle of spontane- ous generation reminds us that the 'facts' established by science are not immutable, but often contain a built-in expiry date. Nabakov recognised this too. While he claimed that he 'often dreamt of a long and exciting career as an obscure curator of Lepi- doptera in a great museum' - and that writing was for him a 'blend of dejection and high spirits, a torture and a pastime' - he had no illu- sions about which part of his legacy would endure: 'I have spent a month in arranging part i of my butterfly work for publication', he wrote to Edmund Wilson, '... Enfin , c'est fait. It is going to remain a wonderful and indispensable thing for some 25 years, after which some fellow will show how wrong I was in this and that. Herein lies the difference between science and art.' Who would not acknowledge for truth... that the Bee hath in it a particle of divine understanding, and heavenly wisdome? Who I say will deny them to have fantasie, memory and some kinde of reason? Thomas Moffet, Theatre of Insects Moffet's plea for the bee was nothing original. The early church had absorbed the platonic idea that a divine force was manifest in every particle of the natural world. A great chain of being connected all things, which were ranged in a vast ascending scale from non-exist- ence to god, with the smallest incremental difference separating one element from the next. Man came next to god in this schema, as a microcosm, a summation of the universe made in god's image. All living creatures had a correspondence in man; all were signs point- ing beyond themselves to transcendental truths. An instructive cata- logue of these correspondences could be found in the third-century Greek Physiologus. Here, every human virtue or vice was shown to have its counterpart in animal behaviour - a man could be timorous like a hare, cunning like a fox, patient like a lamb. To inspire loftier thoughts, there was a sprinkling of more exotic creatures, like self- immolating phoenixes that rose from the ashes on the third day, or wild unicorns pacified in the laps of pure virgins. As Saint Augustine put it, the important thing was to define the moral significance of an animal, not to belabour the point of whether or not it actually exist- ed.6 The object was of course not to give a lesson in natural history, but to inculcate a moral code. The Physiologus in turn became the main source for medieval bestiaries, whose inhabitants consisted of 99 parts symbol to one part phenomenon of nature. By the time of the Theatre of Insects, the Reformation had inspired a revisiting of sources - and a search for a truer, more life- like nature. For Gessner (who taught history at Zurich's Carolinum at the request of Huldrych Zwingli, one of the leaders of the Swiss Reformation), this study of nature was primarily a path to a higher spiritual understanding: 'My first aim with this work was a knowl- edge of the things themselves and an honest and complete contem- plation of nature, which can direct the spirit to a knowledge and a veneration of the Supreme Architect... and like a ladder lead our souls up step by step to the highest plane.'7 Here, transcendental truths were to be sought through direct contact with the things them- selves, rather than through the filter of the established church. But Gessner the naturalist was also still a moralist, telling us: 'There want not instructions out of beasts, by imitation of whose examples the lives and manners of men are to be framed to another and a bet- ter practice.'8 Moffet reprises the theme. Insects are able to furnish men with a 'variety of examples of vertues, whereby they may instruct their souls and teach them that otherwise they would be very wicked'. What's more, 'in the universal world there is nothing more divine than these, except Man'; in other words, as the creatures closest to us in the great chain of being, insects have the most to teach. At the time of its writing, this argument demanded a huge conceptual leap. Aris- totle, the ultimate authority for Renaissance natural history, had consigned insects to the very lowest rung of the scale of creation. And for the population at large, the teeming variety of the insect world could be encompassed in a handful of words, all along the lines of 'worm' (a generic description for anything slithering and repulsive, up to and including a crocodile) or 'moth' (meaning not 'pretty winged creature of the night', but something more like 'mag- got' or 'cockroach'). Some deft manoeuvres were therefore required to catapult the lowly insect to the status of moral exemplar. Moffet first gives his cast of characters decidedly human traits. His grasshoppers, for instance, delight in the company of wayfarers and are reduced to singing 'very low' or 'to themselves' when there's no humanoid around, while his scuttling, 'shamefac't' cellar beetle has a 'guilty conscience' about 'the stink it leaves behinde'. These are creatures that act just like us. Only their actions are not random, but spell out a clear prescription: stay calm in times of crisis, steer a constant course - reason must prevail. Not coincidentally, these principles formed the foundation of a brand new strand of moral philosophy: Justus Lipsius's reworking of ancient stoic thought in response to the Wars of Religion in the Netherlands in the 1580s. Lipsius took what he needed from the Roman stoic Seneca. If we want to live well, Seneca had written, then 38 AA files 63</page><page sequence="4">'We must use Nature as our guide. She it is that Reason heeds, it is of her that it takes counsel. Therefore to live happily is the same thing as to live according to Nature.'9 But, as Lipsius emphasised, this did not imply a retreat into an inte- rior world - the solution of most traditional philoso- phies of consolation - rath- er, to try to make the world a better place one had to actively participate in pub- lic life. For Seneca had said, 'Man is a sociable creature, and is made for the com- mon good of others'.10 As a reminder that the sixteenth century was not uniquely tor- tured, Lipsius referred his readers to Tacitus's Annals , which he described as 'a theatre of our modern life': the reference to a 'thea- tre' also invoked the stoic idea of the theatrum mundi , from which one learned the duty one owed to society. Tacitus's disenchanted view of the tyranny and political skulduggery of first-century Rome struck a nerve in the Netherlands, which was then under the yoke of its Spanish governor, the Duke of Alba. Nor were the parallels between ancient and contemporary times lost on disaffected mem- bers of Elizabeth's court across the Channel, and in particular on the Sidney-Leicester circle (which included Francis Bacon during the tricksy-lawyer stage of his life-cycle, before he metamorphosed into the prophet of the new science). For Sir Philip Sidney, Tacitus's account was a 'pithy opening of the venóme of wickednes' that warned against the dangers of absolutist rule. For Sidney's doctor, Thomas Moffet, Lipsius's frequent use of a medical analogy undoubtedly gave neo-stoicism an added appeal. Where Machiavelli has his prince, Lipsius has his physician: the state is a 'body politic' from which disease must be rooted out. It is against this backdrop that Moffet assembles his insect actors in their very own entomological version of a theatrum mundi , combining a show of natural history with a practical demonstration of Senecan ethics. But not all insects are equal. There is an ascend- ing scale of lessons to be learned. At the bottom is the dung-beetle, toiling away, Sisyphus-like, stoically getting on with things under try- ing circumstances: 'though its house be but a dunghill, yet it lives contented therewith, and is busied and delighted in it'. In the mid- dle are creatures like grasshoppers, which offer a model of enviable stoical equanimity: 'The Grashoppers of all other Insects seem to be without passion, but the perturbations of our mindes do carry us on so headlong, that upon every slight cause, yea none at all, we wax hot with anger, pine away with grief, burn with envy and jealousie'. By overcoming their emotions, grasshoppers have discovered the route to true happiness; they are 'the least melancholy of all creatures'. At the very top of the instructive scale are 'divine' insects such as bees and ants. Aristotle had observed that these were social creatures, like man, and from there he moved to the irresistible conclusion that their societies were also structured politically, just like man's. And bees certainly seemed to have a lot to teach humans about good governance and selfless labour. Moffet's specimens have a 'very great discretion and understanding in them'. Their hive - his utopia - is a 'wonderful well ordered Common-wealth', run with Spartan military precision - and a Spartan-style eugenics programme that disposes of the ill-shaped and the shiftless. The law of the bees is of course the 'law of Nature'. Everyone has a role to play: there are guards, trumpeters, nursemaids and physician bees, administering 'a most medicinable and cordial honey' (detailed formula given). Moffet even finds the drones a job, as the king's architects. In sum, Moffet's hive is a wistful compilation of all the things that contem- porary society was not - orderly, cohesive, peace-loving, respectful towards the elderly, fastidious about personal hygiene and chaste. In all of these details, Moffet's account is fairly conventional. Where he differs radically is in his description of the politics of the hive. By tradition the ruling bee - a king, naturally - was associated with absolute monarchy. Moffet's hive, by contrast, has a contractu- al arrangement. If the king is virtuous, and rules justly, his subjects never desert him. But if he is bad, and 'negligent of the Common- wealth', checks are placed on his behaviour - his wings are literally clipped. If he then mends his ways, and 'demean[s] himself as he ought', he is loved and respected. But if, despite everything, he devel- ops into a tyrant, he is put to death. This kind of constitutionalism was typical of the political thinking of the Sidney-Leicester circle, agitated by their reading of Tacitus.11 All the same, Moffet had been keen to dedicate the work to a monarch - to Elizabeth and, when she expired, to James i - so this episode of regicide barely six pages into his text seems not very tactful, or commercially astute. Moffet's insect world has a parallel in the symbols and emblems devised by Joachim Camerarius the Younger, a physician who had taken over Gessner's unpublished botanical works in 1580. Camer- arius was the first to combine the emblematic tradition with a sys- tematic study of nature based on empirical research.12 He was also a correspondent of both Moffet and Penny, exchanging insect speci- mens and drawings for Penny's drawings of plants. Camerarius often focuses on the same ethico-political messages as Moffet. For example, one of his icons shows a spider's web that has been torn AA files 63 39</page><page sequence="5">open by a number of large angry wasps, though some smaller gnats remain ensnared. ' Violentior exiť - 'the more violent get away' - is the motto. The message: the rich can ride roughshod over the law, but the poor will always be caught. Cam- erarius finishes with a refer- ence to Cicero's stoic dic- tum that the law should speak to all with one and the same voice.13 Moffet relates the same tale, but adds a different rider: pow- erful men who break the law will ultimately have to sub- mit to a 'Better Judge', who will wrap them 'in a more tenacious glew'. Like the Physiologus and the medieval bestiaries, the emblematic work of Camer- arius is driven by a moralising impulse. But in contrast to his prede- cessors, Camerarius limits himself to natural phenomena that are real: all his plants, animals, birds and insects exist, and all are drawn true to life. These were true emblems : in order to be valid as symbols, they had to be grounded in the literal truth. The same desire for truth and substantiation is evident with Moffet, who is concerned to show the 'true use' and 'true nature' of insects, without recourse to 'hieroglyphics'. Despite these good intentions, however, the truth is sometimes elusive. For example, both Camerarius and Moffet report that scarab beetles, 'bred and fed with dung', are killed by the beau- tiful scent of the rose. For Camerarius, this confirms the time-hon- oured opposition between a sweet virtuous life and filthy indolence: 'What is safe for one, is harmful to others / Just as the rose is death to the scarab and a delight to the bee / So virtue is pleasing to the good and hateful to the bad'. Moffet, on the other hand, attempts a differ- ent rationalisation - it is all a matter of habitude - and has evidence to back his theory up: he 'remembers' how a man who cleaned priv- ies in Antwerp had passed out when he smelled the spices in an apothecary's shop, and only revived when a quick-thinking bystand- er stuffed some horse-dung under his nose. And Moffet's special attempt to rehabilitate the dung-beetle takes him deeper into the realms of myth. There is one species in India, he says, that battles with the local eagles. He interprets this as a sign of extreme courage - of the valiant underdog's stand against an immeasurably more powerful foe. Of course, there is no such bee- tle in India, but there is one very much like it in a fable by Aesop, which Moffet must have heard so many times that it acquired real substance and became solidly embedded in his mental landscape (and by extension the natural world). Another example of such subli- mation is Moffet's beautiful image of bees carrying tiny stones in stormy weather to 'poise and balance their light bodies' - a detail drawn not from direct observation, but from Virgil's Georgics. The idea of the insect as some kind of technical wonder had deep roots. 'Nature is to be found in her entirety nowhere more than in her smallest creations', said Pliny the Elder, introducing the section on insects in his Natural History. This concept had a ready parallel in classical aesthetics, in the miniaturised artworks produced as virtu- oso displays of human ingenuity and craftsmanship - such as Cal- ibrates' carving of exact replicas of ants from ivory. It could also be easily converted into a Christian analogue. For Saint Augustine, god's 'immensity' was to be found in all things, but was present in greater concentrations in smaller forms: for this reason the 'fabric' of the ant or bee was to be 'more admired than the whale's'.14 Gessner reiterates the theme: 'Who can admire or praise ade- quately the miraculous bodies of ants and bees... and the fact that small bodies house such complicated minds!' This appreciation had a distinct aesthetic dimension, based largely on Aristotle's concep- tion of form: 'Form is truly the internal and essential aspect of things, something which can only be understood by reason'. Form is 'purely mathematical', and so can be abstracted from matter. Form is equated with the soul, matter with the body, but the soul finds external expression in 'aspects of being' such as growth, mobility 40 AA FILES 63</page><page sequence="6">and cognitive ability - which Aristotle called 'faculties of the soul'. Since tiny insects contain a full complement of these faculties in an 'extremely small, almost nothing body', they represent, for Gessner, a kind of triumph of soul over body - the greatest possible abstrac- tion of form from matter.15 Gessner's aesthetic approach is also evident in the illustrations to his work. Naturalistic images had become increasingly common across a number of fields from the 1530s, such as botany, with books by Otto Brunfels (1532) and Leonhard Fuchs (1542); or anatomy, with Andreas Vesalius (1543). They were firstly an identification tool, designed to be used in conjunction with the text: 'Illustrations great- ly assist the understanding', said Vesalius, 'for they place more clear- ly before the eyes what the text no matter how explicitly describes'.16 Gessner's own images are also about communicating things that stretch the capabilities of language. What they are attempting to convey, however, is not just practical information but an aesthetic ideal - the ever-unfolding dignity and beauty of a nature that is in a 'mimetic relation' to the divinity, through 'bodies that are like mir- rors'. These are truly things, Gessner states, 'that cannot be ade- quately rendered in words, nor can the human mind grasp them'.17 Characteristic of Gessner's illustrations is the detailed repre- sentation of the outer appearance of various creatures, but the images also seem to want to convey their true inner nature, mainly through an emphasis on Aristot- le's 'faculties of the soul' - and above all animation. If you leaf through the volumes of Gessner's Historiae animalium you will see a myriad of animals in action - a snapping crocodile, a leaping hare, a loping polecat - and even a tame, tethered ferret, staring dolefully at its empty food bowl. Moffet refers to precisely this quality of animation when he describes Penny's drawings in a letter to his former teacher, Theo- dor Zwinger. Penny's insects real- ly do seem to run and fly, he says, and this animal motion makes the drawings so much more 'ele- gant and excellent' than any draw- ing of plants, where the life-force remains obscure.18 The anima- tion of the object seems to stimu- late in Moffet a kind of aesthetic sympathy - or 'empathy', to use the term introduced in the nine- teenth century to describe this phenomenon. For German theo- rists of aesthetic perception such as Robert Vischer, the apparent motion of the observed artefact engaged the mind, triggering an unconscious projection of the viewer's own body - and with this, their spirit - onto the form of the object.19 Many of the illustrations in the manuscript of the Theatre of Insects convey an extraordinary mobility - caterpillars wriggle, bee- tles launch into a purposeful trot, even butterflies walk with a sparky spring-loaded action. And their naturalistic quality is reinforced by the fact that they are drawn not just from life, but at one-to-one scale. Not all the images in the manuscript are by Penny, however. Draw- ings of natural objects were a key item of exchange among the com- munity of naturalists. They were particularly useful for the study of insects, since they were durable, unlike the short-lived specimens, and robustly portable - again, unlike the real thing, which in its frag- ile desiccated form was all too prone to shedding spindly little legs and other body parts. They also preserved the vivid colours of the liv- ing insects, which invariably faded after death. Through their translation into print, the images inevitably lose the detail of the drawn models. But where the medium of the wood- cut falls short, Moffet steps in - as an artist of words - to flesh out the picture. A mantis from the Maghreb is described as having a head that is 'pyramidal, very long, out of which... came forth two lit- tle broad cornicles about an inch long, much like that Turbant, which the Turkish Janizaries use with two feathers in it'. Another 'wonderful beautiful' butterfly has wings of a 'light bloud-colour, dipt with black spots', that 'shine with smal long beams dispersedly drawn like threds to the very outmost of the coat, and this is adorned... with golden crooked lines like the Moon'. This is all very evocative, but Penny took a quite different approach to description. This is how he described a fly: 'Its body is oblong and butterfly-like; its head is small and yellowish; its eyes large, prominent and black; its proboscis with which it sucks dew from flowers is curled up, and of a mullein-yellow colour; its horns ( cornicula ) are two, black, rather long, attached a little above the eyes; its abdomen and back are leaden greyish, the tip of the tail is almost yellow.' 'Penny wanted me to be a bold critic, not just some kind of honor- ary witness to his work' - that, at least, is how Moffet describes his role in a letter he wrote not long after completing the Theatre of Insects manuscript.20 In this capaci- ty, Moffet reports on the experi- ments undertaken by Penny and his network of correspondents. The vast bulk of these seem designed to provoke the response of the insect's alien nervous system, with many variations on the theme of 'Take off the head of a Fly... yea it will run, leap and seem as it were to breathe'. More imaginatively, James Garret, an 'industrious and ingenious Apothecary', plucks off AA FILES 63 41</page><page sequence="7">the wings of crickets and rubs them together, to 'cunningly imitate' their chirping. The 'learned Scaliger' keeps crickets in a box 'for their musick sake', but they expire after three days, 'for being seclud- ed from the air they cannot live', while Penny traps two flies 'in the Act' and incarcerates them, opening the box the next day to discover them locked in the same position. Further experiments with glow- worms provoke various musings on the limits of knowledge. Moffet reports how he kept some in a clear glass for 12 days, always supply- ing fresh grass, but saw their light gradually dim as they languished away, until finally it was extinguished. On this basis he ridicules con- temporary attempts to produce 'perpetual light' - a kind of proto- lightbulb - from a decoction of glow-worms. He tells us about these experiments, but framed in such a way that his readers can 'plainly understand how foolishly and vainly mans wisdome doth many times vaunt it self, and whither our wits may be carried, if not found- ed on right Reason, the mistress of all Arts and Sciences, shunning with all diligence the uncooth rocks of opinion and self conceit'. For the neo-stoics, the mind was a battlefield in which opinion continually vied with reason for supremacy. The triumph of right rea- son was the only way to reach the desired goal of constancy, but there were clear limits to what could be known. Any claims to 'infallible truth' had to be confined to the realm of shared physical experience, for ultimately it was not within man's power to fully understand the divinity; instead, god simply had to be trusted. Moffet adds a dose of his own fire-and-brimstone for anyone entertaining presumptuous thoughts: in seeking to counterfeit divinely imbued light, the 'wits of these times... do violate the Deity' and they will reap a just reward - on 'Ixion's wheel', or at the wrong end of a lighting-bolt. Moffet saw insect bites and stings as god's way of humbling man - a more subtle form of torture than Ixion's wheel. Yet even nasty insects had potentially beneficial applications. According to the tra- ditional medical principle of sympathy and antipathy, the more repulsive a remedy was, the more effective it was likely to be. This made ectoparasites the insect med- icine of choice. Bed-bugs were par- ticularly prized on account of their revolting smell, though Galenists were also fond of the idea that lice could remove noxious humours. Moffet was not a Galenist, but he set all these remedies down, in most cases without communicat- ing his opinion or any attempt at verification. Moffet does, however, tell us that 'experience proves' that jaun- dice is 'cured with 12 bruised Lice drank with Wine', though he does not say whose 'experience' this is. He reports on Gessner's prescrip- tion for colic - four live bed-bugs, to be taken with wine at regular two-hourly intervals - a 'loathsome remedy' but a 'present cure'. And he signals that Penny 'gave Lice and Butter to beggers and such as live on alms, very often, and so he recovered some that were almost desperate'. Penny also self-medi- cated, treating his asthma with woodlice steeped in wine. This didn't work, says Moffet ('to conceal nothing from you'). But his own treatment did: 'by my advice... he did twice or thrice take in the smoke of Brimstone through a tunnel, and he grew perfectly well from that horrid symptome'. This is one of the few explicit referenc- es to Moffet's chemical practice. Inhaling sulphur vapours would probably have dilated the bronchial tubes - akin to contemporary metered-dose asthma inhalers - and a few other things besides. Moffet also slips in an advertisement for a 'singular remedy against the weakness of the Genital part', involving a compound of Spanish fly - a prototypical Viagra that somehow, inexplicably, both Penny and Gessner had overlooked. Both Moffet and Penny had begun their medical studies at Cam- bridge before moving abroad to gain the practi- cal skills they needed: Moffet to the University of Basel, Penny to Mont- pellier. But both also fell foul of the newly estab- lished London College of Physicians, which was suspicious of everything except the book-based, 42 AA FILES 63 Galenist training of Cambridge. As a result, Moffet's applications to join the College were frequently stalled, while Penny ran into even bigger trouble. He was twice imprisoned for practising without a licence, and was only left alone after his patron, the Lord Chancellor Sir Walter Mildmay, threatened to sue the College. But the College's zeal for regulation is perhaps understandable in light of the profes- sion's irresistible attractiveness to charlatans. Moffet tells of one, a 'lustfull nephew' of his friend William Brewer, who was ready to try anything, 'having spent his estate in rioting and Brothel-houses'. The young man tracked down a rich matron on the brink of expiry and posed as a physician with a miracle cure. After taking her money he administered his 'treatment', a drink laced with spider - then left town fast before being inculpated in the woman's demise. But rather than dying the woman was cured by the 'force of the venóme'. As Moffet indignantly exclaims, this 'mountebank' and 'quacksalver' had by sheer chance stumbled upon a most potent medicine, excel- lent for sundry ailments from eye infections to 'that knotty Whip of God, and mock of all Physicians, the Gowť. Moffet muses: 'I know not what it was that made Pennius so frighted when he thought of eating them... For the truth is, Spiders are very good for ones health'. With the spider, Moffet's hymn of praise to insects becomes something more like a love song. The spider's skin, he tells us, is 'so smooth, polished and neat, that she precedes the softest skin'd maydes'. He imagines for a moment the pleasure of getting tangled in her web: 'so soon as they see an enemy fain within their nets, they do not presently wound him, or bite him in a hostile manner, but they kisse as it were and tickle him, until they have all smeered him over with a clammy web... taking away from him all power of resist- ance'. On top of this, spiders are Moffet's model for perfect conjugal harmony: they 'choose their mates, and never part till death'; they support each other at home, by their 'mutual courtesie' and</page><page sequence="8">'interchangeable work' of hunting and weaving; and tenderly incubate and raise their innumerable offspring.21 In 1678 another physician, Martin Lister, published his own detailed study of spiders. He described their moulting, courtship, copulation and feeding of their young, as well as the way they wove their webs and pro- jected balloons of gossamer thread to lift themselves up with the breeze. And he did all this in a brisk, methodical way, without drawing on allegory or Greek myth. His sev- enth chapter is particularly to the point, con- sisting of an enumerated list of 23 'beliefs handed down from the Ancients and from more recent writers, some doubtful, some spurious'. Aristotle and Pliny are collectively responsible for seven of these spurious beliefs; Moffet single-handedly achieves an unbeatable total of 12, ranging from the misconception that spiders mate for life to the assertion that 'each young spider learns from its mother how to weave its own web'.22 Lister had no time for this kind of sloppy anthropomorphism. He complained bitter- ly to his friend John Ray: Moffet was 'a wretched compiler of material taken from others... And not only was he ignorant about the subject itself, he expounded on it in a totally unintelligible way.'23 Ray, however, was not so dismissive, tell- ing Lister he was being too harsh on Moffet, 'for in my opinion he is not unworthy of the Republic of Letters, and many learned men would agree with me'.24 In Ray and Moffet, there is a shared humility in the face of nature. For Ray, insects 'manifest and dis- play the Riches of the Power and Wisdom of God'.25 They are useful too - as part of the animal food-chain, as 'noble Medicines', and as scourges when God 'is pleased to make use of them'. In this last respect, they are the divine equivalent of those standing armies, 'generally made up of very rude and insolent People', that a prudent state maintains to 'punish rebels, and other disorderly and vicious Persons, and keep the World in quiet'.26 Like Moffet, Ray had inherited a large number of records of insects from a friend who had 'bestowed much pains' on them. Towards the end of his life he began work on a history of insects, partly to preserve this legacy of Francis Willughby. Ray hoped to sup- plement Willughby's notes with his own descriptions of the exotic specimens that were now found in the 'cabinets of the curious' all over London. On another level, Ray's reference to Moffet's place in the 'Republic of Letters' indicates the continuing importance of rhetoric in English natural philosophy right up to the end of the sev- enteenth century. Francis Bacon may have insisted that learning 'was distempered when words are valued more than matter'. But his attack was on florid, embellished modes of expression, and not on rhetoric itself, which he saw as having the 'duty and office... to apply Reason to Imagination for the better moving of the will'.27 Henry Powers' Experimental Philosophy (1664) - the first book in English on microscopy - begins by invoking Moffet's appeal to 'right Reason, the mistress of all Arts and Sciences'. But 'right reason', for Moffet, had not yet assumed the rigorous form that it would with the Baconian programme. Bacon appreciated the stoic idea that reason was grounded in nature, but would only prevail if cultivated by a dis- ciplined mind. His Advancement of Learning (1605) set out the way to achieve this 'Culture and Regiment of the mind'. The first require- ment was the creation of a new reservoir of knowledge, formed of sense-data gathered from the study of nature; only this would pro- vide a firm basis on which reason could build. In setting out his plan for the reform of learning, Bacon's aim was 'to make the mind sound , and without perturbation; beautiful , and graced with decency and strong and agile for all the duties of life'. As Adriana McCrea has pointed out, this sounds very much like a redefinition of the essen- tial neo-stoic principle of constancy.28 The sense-data that formed the new basis for knowledge was gathered from a direct experience of the natural world. But the mean- ing of 'experience' also shifted after the time of Moffet. It was no longer the Aristotelian 'experience' of 'what happens always or most of the time'. And it was no longer enough for one man to say 'experi- ence proves' without providing evidence to back up his claim: the Royal Society's motto, Nullius in verba ('Take No-one's Word for it'), signalled as much. As with the neo-stoics, any claims to 'truth' had to be confined to the realm of shared physical experience. In a society not yet recovered from a civil war, achieving consensus was vital. In the late seventeenth century, the Royal Society was principally concerned with questions of the reproduction, respiration, circulation, digestion and metamorphosis of insects - issues that Moffet barely touches on.29 And unlike Moffet, the new philoso- phers conducted their investigations in a system- atic way. Robert Hooke described, with evident disquiet, some of their methods of inquiring into nature: by Grindings, Burnings , Weighings and Measuring , Pressing and Condensing , Dilating and Expanding, Dissecting , Separating and Divid- ing, Sifting and Streining; by viewing with Glasses and Microscopes, Smelling, Tasting, Feeling, and various other ways of Torturing and Wracking of Natural Bodies, to find out the Truth or the real Effect as it is in its Constitution or State of Being.30 The truth of insects was something that a Dutch correspondent of the Royal Society, Jan Swammerdam, was in no doubt about. He explicitly rejected the idea of spontaneous generation, as it implied that certain elements of creation were contingent, and did not depend on god's will. His general history of insects, first published in Dutch in 1669, set out how all insects came from eggs and devel- oped by 'slow transformations' that were subject to simple rules. The simplicity and regularity of his model of nature was inspired by Descartes. These few laws, however, remained impenetrable to the AA files 63 43</page><page sequence="9">human mind.31 And the only response in face of the wonder of creation was rapture and adoration. John Ray never finished his history of insects. His correspondence with Hans But men must know , that in this theatre of man's life it is reserved only for God and Angels to be lookers on. Francis Bacon, Advancement of Learning Here Descartes had a role to play, with his reworking of Aristotelian form into res cogi- tans (the mind, indivisible and immaterial), as opposed to res extensa (mere matter). Where before human superiority had been Sloane describes his deteriorating health, and the running sores on his legs, which he was treating with a chemical remedy - not mercu- ry, since his body had reacted violently to it in the past, but sulphur.32 He offers a diagnosis: 'I am at present in evil case... I do now take these sores to... proceed from invisible insects nestling in the cutis'. With disinterested clarity, he observes 'flat-headed spots around the tumours, which may be the nests of these insects (like ant-hills), they seeming to be gregarious; but all this is only conjectural.'33 The Theatre of Insects emerged out of the Reformation's all- embracing pursuit of 'Truth', in the form of a true Faith, a true Chris- tian commonwealth, a true book of scripture, a true book of nature. In the case of the Theatre of Insects, the specific target appears to have been a true Physiologus - a book of moral tales founded on authentic natural phenomena. However, the 40-year delay in its publication meant that it missed the moment when the symbol could comforta- bly merge with the thing itself and its claims to authenticity soon dis- solved under the disciplined gaze of a later generation of naturalists. As Baconian science advanced, the natural world lost its role as a book of hidden signs and became instead a reservoir of data from which the Truth or the real Effect' could be methodically extracted. Human reason was increasingly viewed as separate from nature. asserted through the concept of man as a microcosm embodying all other creatures, Cartesian man rose above the rest of creation by virtue of his mind, which was immaterial, defined by reason, and not subject to the simple mechanical laws that governed the lower orders. Cartesian animals were merely machines - not even con- scious, let alone rational or moral. Yet, in truth, insects never really stopped being symbols - the scaffolding for the construction of a world of man's own invention. For the physico-theologians from the late seventeenth century on, their finely wrought anatomies were irrefutable signs of divine craftsmanship: they spoke of a whole universe that had been designed down to the last micro-detail with the benefit of man in mind. This mental construction flourished despite the evident non- conformity of nature, which often refused to be 'beneficial', and scarcely seemed to follow some greater moral plan. But those perfid- ious insects - having helped to secure the rise of the argument for design - would then play a part in its eventual demise. Or as Charles Darwin wrote in i860 in a letter to Asa Gray, 'I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent god would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feed- ing on the living bodies of caterpillars'.34 1.
