<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROMANESQUE SPANISH MURAL PAINTING (I) BY WALTER W. S. COOK I. UNTIL a comparatively recent date the existence of important Romanesque schools of mural painting in Spain was hardly recognised. The frescoes in the Pante6n de los Reyes at S. Isidoro, Leon, and the mural decoration in S. Cristo de la Luz at Toledo were the only Romanesque examples which were considered worthy of notice by the authors of Museo espafiol de antigiiedades. Although occasional notices had appeared of wall paintings in the province of Catalonia, these attracted little attention until the publication by Pijoan in 1907 of the frescoed apse in the small church of S. Quirse at Pedret. Such interest was aroused by this pub- lication which appeared in the first fascicule of Pintures murals catalanes, issued with color plates by the newly founded Institut d'Estudis Catalans at Barcelona,' that a systematic search on the part of archaeologists and excursionistas followed.2 Many of the small churches in the region of La Seu de Urgell and the Pyrenean valleys of Andorra, Aneu, Bohf, and Ribera de Card6s were examined, and within a comparatively short time rem- nants of more than fifteen mural paintings, all in a more or less damaged condition, were discovered. The prompt publication of the newly found frescoes of Catalonia by the Institut d'Estudis Catalans' aroused an unusual interest in this local Romanesque school and in i. J. Pijoan, Pintures murals catalanes, Barcelona, 1907, fasc. I, pp. 3-7. The mural paintings at Pedret were mentioned as early as I889 by Joseph Puiggarf, but little notice was taken of them (Pintures murals de Pedret in L'Aveng, Barcelona, 1889, pp. IoS-Iio).

Attention had already been called to the frescoed chapel of St. Martin de Fenouillar by J. A. Brutails, L'dglise Saint-Martin-de-Fenouilar, in Bulletin archdo- logique du comiltd des travaux historiques, i886, pp. 443-449 and in L'art religi6s en el Rossel6, Barcelona, I9goI, pp. 150-I52. In the latter work Brutails also mentioned mural paintings in Roussillon at Marcevol, St. Martin du Canig6, S. Andreu de Sureda, and S. Joan lo Veil at Perpignan. M. Gudiol had also mentioned wall paintings at S. Pere and S. Maria de Terrasa, S. Anna de Monral, S. Pere de Casseres, Campdenavol, (J. Gudiol i Cunill, Noci6ns de arqueologia sagrada catalana, Vich, 1902, pp. 248-249, fig. 82; idem, Descubriment de pintures romdniques en el Bisbat de Vich, in Revista de la asociaci6n artistica-arqueo- 16gica Barcelonesa, 1909, VII, pp. 2o2-2o4).

Maria de Mur in the province of Lerida, was brought to the Museum of Fine Arts at Boston.5 So successful was the installation of the Catalan mural paintings in public museums that legitimate hopes were raised that similar Romanesque paintings might be recovered from beneath coats of whitewash in parish churches and abandoned monasteries farther to the West. As for Upper Aragon, the existence of mural paintings had long been known. As early as i866 Carderera mentioned that many churches, cloisters, and hermitages in Aragon contained fresco paintings and in "far greater number than any other province of Spain."'6 He called attention especially to mural decoration in the region of Huesca, but these examples, for the most part, were not earlier than the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.7 In fact, with the exception of the Romanesque fragments in the former cathedral of Roda (Figs. 1-4),8 in the Ribagorza, nearly all the mural paintings are late Romanesque or Gothic in style. This includes the remains of wall paintings at Bierge (S. Fructuoso), Barluenga (Sra. Miguel), Monflorite (N. Sra. de los Dolores), Ibieca (S. Miguel de Foces), Liesa (N. Sra. del Monte), the royal convent of Sijena (Figs. 5, 6), Alqu6zar (Colegiata), Concilio, and the monastery of S. Juan de la Pefia.9 II. One of the avowed purposes of the first expedition of the Spanish Research and Pub- lication Committee of the College Art Association was the examination of many newly 4.

"Parece que desde el siglo XII se llenaron, numerosas iglesias, claustros y ermitas de pinturas murales, en tanto nimero, que no creemos presente igual provincia alguna de Espaita" (Valentin Carderera y Solano, Noticia de Jusepe Martinez y Resefia historica de la pintura en la corona de Arag6n, a prologue in Jusepe Martinez, Discursos practica- bles del nobilisimo arte de pintura, Madrid, 1866, pp. 8-9) 7. Some of the Aragonese frescoes mentioned by Carderera have disappeared during the past fifty years, as shown by his notes preserved in the provincial library at Huesca. One of those is a fresco in the monastery of Ala6n, similar in style to those at Sijena. He also mentions mural paintings in a bad state in the church of the Templars at Barbastro. This small church, first placed under the patronage of Santa F6, and known afterward by the name of S. Juan, passed to the knights of Malta. Quadrado states that the walls of a chapel were decorated from top to bottom with paintings, and these undoubtedly represented scenes from the life of Santa F6. At the bottom could be deciphered the remains of an inscription: . . . ISTER ALFOSS DE . . . UBRI DEPICTOR, and probably ME FECIT. (Jos6 M. Quadrado, Espaita, sus monu- mentos y artes; Arag6n, Barcelona, i886, pp. I156-157.) 8.

These, however, almost without exception, proved to be relatively late in date. In western Aragon (province of Saragossa) one of the earliest examples in a fairly good state of preservation is found in the hermitage church of S. Juan at Uncastillo.10 The apse con- tains an imposing figure of the Majestas Domini, seated on a cushioned throne, with the right hand upheld in benediction (Fig. 9). On either side, in the upper register of the vault, are standing apostles and the lower register contains two scenes (Figs. 7, 8, io). The better preserved scene on the left shows John baptizing his disciples. Above is the legend POPUL[US] CREDEN[TES](?) IOH[ANNE]S(?) On the right the saint stands under arrest before Herod. This work, which can be dated in the first half of the thirteenth century, shows clearly the influence of Romanesque models and is more closely allied than most Aragonese mural decoration to the Romanesque series of Catalonia. The mural paintings at Sos del Rey Catblico, also on the western frontier of Aragon," proved to be much later than those at Uncastillo. Originally the walls and ceilings of at least two chapels in the lower church at Sos were embellished with scenes from the Infancy cycle and lives of saints (Fig. i i). The best preserved portions were concealed behind the altar of La Virgen del Perd6n, until they were discovered in 1924 by Dr. Pascual Galindo Romeo of Saragossa. Although much of the original decoration is still covered by a thin coat of plaster, enough is now visible to show that the walls were originally painted in the fully developed fourteenth century Gothic style of Navarre. They are somewhat reminis- cent of the Gothic paintings in the church and sala capitular of the royal convent of Sijena (Figs. 5, 6).12 As for southern Aragon, the best preserved examples of mural decoration are found in the church of S. Miguel at Daroca.'3 A large Coronation of the Virgin is shown in the center of the curving wall of the main apse (Fig. 13). Christ and the Madonna are seated on a throne and the cloth of honor is upheld by angels. The central panel is surrounded by a perspective meander and is bordered on either side by three registers containing angels with candelabra and musical instruments. The lowest section of the wall has suffered much from moisture, but the standing figures of Sts. Peter, Paul, and other apostles can be recognized. io. Uncastillo is one of the Cinco-Villas of Aragon. It is in the province of Saragossa and belongs to the diocese of Jaca. There are two parish churches, S. Maria and S. Martin; the church of S. Juan lies outside the town. During the Middle Ages the place was of great importance, due to its strongly fortified castle, and obtained special privileges from Sancho I, Ramiro, and other Aragonese kings. For a discussion of the town see P. Madoz, Diccionario geogrdfico-estadistico-historico de Espaha y sus posesiones de Ultramar, Madrid, 1849, XV, pp. 215-216. ii. Sos del Rey Cat61ico is situated one hundred and thirteen kilometers from Saragossa and six kilometers from the borders of Navarre. The castle, which is said to date from 970, was rebuilt and strengthened by Alfonso the Warrior and King Ramiro (1138) (Pablo Riera y Sans, Diccionario geogrdfico de Espafia, X, pp. 93-94). As a frontier town of Aragon it was strongly fortified and in 1362 the king of Navarre took it after a long siege. Several conferences between the kings of Aragon and Navarre were held here during the wars of Castile between Peter the Cruel and his brother Henry of Trastamara. King Ferdinand the Catholic was born here, March io, 1452. 12. Cf. Gudiol, Els trescentistes, segona part, Barcelona, PP. 97-98, figs. 34-38; Ricardo del Arco, op. cit., 1919, no. 94, PP- 248-50, figs. 16-18; Ricardo del Arco and Luciano Labastida, El alto Arag6n monumental -y pinto- resco, pp. 49, 52; Mariano de Pano in Arag6n hist6rico; idem in Linajes de Arag6n, 1913. 13. The church has suffered many changes, the oldest portions dating from the Romanesque period (V. Lam- p6rez, Historia de la arquitectura cristiana espahola en la edad media, Madrid, 1907, I, p. 687, fig. 287).</page><page sequence="8">334 THE ART BULLETIN Equally fine in quality is a mural painting on a side wall of the church of S. Miguel at Daroca (Fig. 12). Here an imposing figure of St. Valerian, clad in bishop's robes, is seated on a throne underneath a trefoil arch; he holds the eucharistic wafer in his right hand and at the left and right are kneeling figures of a king, queen, and other dignitaries. In the register above, the doubting Thomas touches the wound of the Saviour and on either side appear standing figures of the apostles. The compartments are separated by a ribbon ornament; the predominating colors of the draperies are red, orange, and yellow; the backgrounds are pale blue. Earlier than the two examples mentioned above is a mural painting recently uncovered in the apse of the church of S. Juan (Fig. 14). The figure of St. John the Baptist is placed in the center of the composition and scenes from his life and martyrdom are portrayed in the side compartments, with a damaged Last Supper depicted above. All three paintings at Daroca are in the fully developed Gothic style and show no traces of Romanesque influence. An investigation of other possible sites in this region did not disclose the work of earlier artists. Slight remains of mural decoration were found in the Cistercian abbey of Veruela,'4 above the portal which leads from the cloister to the church and in the fortified tower, known as the Correctorio (Fig. 15). In the latter the Annunciation and figure of God the Father are portrayed above the portal and below are two saints. The large inscription above the doorway reads MISERERE MEI DEVS. SECVNDVM MAGNAM MISERI COR- DIAM TVAM. Fragments of mural painting were also found in the monastery of Piedra,15 in the cathedral at Tarazona,16 in a chapel in the castle at Mesones, and in the castle at Alcafiiz,17 but these proved to be even later in date than those at Daroca. III. In the province of Navarre,18 no mural paintings of the twelfth century were found. Originally, the Romanesque cathedral of Pamplona, consecrated in 1124, may have con- tained an important series, but any traces were destroyed with the complete rebuilding, begun in the late fourteenth century (I390-I420),19 and construction of the present Gothic structure. As for the Gothic period, faded remnants of decoration are still visible on the walls of the cathedral cloister at Pamplona, and of these the best preserved example por- trays the genealogy of Christ, with the Crucifixion, the Virgin, St. John, and prophets 14. The Cistercian monastery of Veruela, in the province of Saragossa and the diocese of Tarazona, was founded late in the twelfth century. All that remains of the ancient part of the monastery are the church and sala capitula, transitional in style, and a Gothic cloister. Cf.

Sra. de la Piedra, in the province of Saragossa and diocese of Tarazona, also dates from the late twelfth century (I195-M2x8). It was begun under D. Alfonso II of Aragon and was completed under James the Conqueror, but the original construction was disfigured during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Lamp6rez, op. cit., II, pp. 465-66, fig. 456.); cf.

Perhaps the most interesting fragment in the cathedral is that preserved behind the altar of the former refectory. At a late period the upper part of this mural painting was "restored," but the lower section is in its original state and shows the Burial and Resurrection of Christ. These scenes are by an excellent artist of the fourteenth century and in style are analogous to the mural paintings at Sos. Outside of Pamplona other fragments of mural painting are gradually coming to light. A Gothic example has recently been uncovered at Puenta la Reina, in the Iglesia del Crucifijo. From documents it is possible to assume that the royal palace at Olite, the ancient seat of the kings of Navarre, originally contained an important Gothic series of mural decoration, but to-day the castle is in ruins. An investigation of the other possible sites in Navarre, at Artajona, Sorleda, and elsewhere, revealed frescoes no earlier than the late Gothic and Renaissance periods.20 IV. A more extensive search recently undertaken by the writer in the provinces of Castile and Leon yielded interesting and important results. The Romanesque frescoes in the Pante6n de los Reyes at S. Isidoro, Leon, were revisited." At Toledo a coat of plaster had been removed from the curving apse vault of the ancient church of S. Cristo de la Luz and traces of an early Majestas Domini can now be seen, as well as the figures of saints on the apse walls which had long been known.22 The painted vault in the church of S. F6 at Toledo, on the other hand, also a recent discovery, proved to be much later in date. The highly important series at S. Baudel de Berlanga (province of Soria) have recently been removed from Spain.23 The ruined monastery of Arlanza, not far from Hortiguiela, was revisited and the faded Gothic frescoes which have now been almost entirely uncovered were found to be in an advanced state of deterioration. Although there have been nego- tiations for the removal of these interesting mural paintings to the museum of Fine Arts at Barcelona, it is highly probable that there will be little to remove unless quick action is taken.24 At the monastery of S. Domingo de Silos traces of Gothic paintings were found 20. I am indebted for many courtesies shown to me at Pamplona by Sr. D.

V. Acting on clues furnished by local antiquarians, new sites were visited and additional unknown frescoes of the Romanesque period were studied. The most important examples which have thus far escaped the attention of archaeologists are the mural paintings in a small chapel at Maderuelo. The village of Maderuelo lies north of the Guadarrama mountains and south of Aranda de Duero, on the Riaza river, a tributary of the Duero, and is situated in the northeast corner of the province of Segovia, far from the beaten track of travel.25 Until recently there were only footpaths to the town but now a road has been cut through from Campo de S. Pedro. The latter village can be reached by motor car from Bocequillas, which lies on the main highway between Madrid and Aranda de Duero, and also from the village of Saldana, on the road from S. Esteban de Gormaz. Maderuelo contains but a handful of inhabitants, most of whom are peasants.26 On a small knoll in an isolated spot south of the town of Maderuelo, across the Riaza river, stands the hermitage known as "Ermita de la Cruz" (Fig. 27). For years the nave of the building was without a roof. This, however, has now been repaired, new windows and doorways have been cut through the walls and the structure has been converted into a farmhouse, and is inhabited by a family of Castilian peasants. The apse, a chapel at the east end, appears to have suffered less damage than the remainder of the building. This was not employed as a dwelling but served until quite recently as a storeroom for potatoes and other farm products! The discovery that this temporary storeroom was entirely decorated with mural paintings led to activity on the part of a Spanish art dealer, and negotiations were begun for the sale and removal of the frescoes. Nothing, however, has yet been removed, and it is still possible to study the series in situ (Figs. 17-28). This small chapel which served as the apse of the hermitage, is nearly square in plan, measuring about four meters on each side. Originally, an altar stood in the center or at the east end; but this has disappeared and the chapel is now completely empty. Light enters through the narrow east window and a square opening in the south wall, and there is no difficulty in studying the mural decorations which cover the four walls and ceiling. Although the lower sections of the walls have suffered from abuse and moisture, the colors Lamp6rez, op. cit., I, pp. 355-369, 478, 480. See also G6mez-Moreno in Bol. de la Real Academia de la Historia, LXXXVI, pp. 13-06, who dates the frescoes about 1132; J. Chap6e, in Revue de l'art chritien, LXII, 1912, pp. 380, 381. Since the above lines were written the mural paintings have been transferred to canvas and will eventually appear on the walls of a Spanish museum. 25. It lies twenty-two kilometers north of Riaza and seventy-seven kilometers from Segovia. 26. To-day there are not more than eight hundred inhabitants, most of whom are engaged in agriculture, raising cereals, potatoes, etc. In the fifteenth century the town belonged to the powerful constable of Castile, Alvaro de Luna, and was at the head of a group of nine villages. During the Middle Ages it contained more than ten parishes, but these have now been reduced to one, that of S. Maria de la Asunci6n, which belongs to the diocese of Segovia.

In view of the fact that these paintings have never been published and are quite unknown a detailed description will be necessary.27 The chapel is covered by a barrel vault, and this forms of the upper wall at either end a lunette, in which Genesis scenes are portrayed. The lunette at the west end, above the present entrance, contains the Creation of Adam and the Temptation and Fall (Fig. 17). In the scene of the Creation, God the Father, portrayed with a plain, light red nimbus, long, light blue tunic and reddish brown mantle, holds Adam (ATM) with his left hand and extends the right in a gesture of speech. The bearded Adam is completely nude and he is shown on one knee, as if slowly rising from the ground. The composition is closed on the left by a tree, with small leaves and a fruit resembling cherries. The Fall of Man, shown on the right, follows the traditional Spanish version of this scene. The tempting serpent is coiled about a light green tree, and Eve, on the right, reaches forward and takes the fruit from its mouth. The knees of Eve are bent and she appears to be falling forward, an attitude which can be ascribed to the artist's inability to adapt the figure properly in the restricted field of the lunette. Adam, who stands in a three-quarters position at the left, gazes at the serpent and rests his chin on his hand in a gesture of doubt. Both the nude figures cover themselves with large leaves and are identified by the words ATM AT EV[A]. Two Gospels scenes were undoubtedly portrayed on the lower section of the west wall, and these were divided from the lunette above by a wide ribbon ornament which is bordered on either side by a narrow red band. These two scenes are now destroyed and all that remains are the tops of arcades with conical towers and crenelated roof. At the right of the doorway all trace of the original scene has been lost; at the left, the head of a dog indicates that the Annunciation to the Shepherds may have been represented in this space. The lunette on the east wall of the chapel is in a fair state of preservation (Fig. 18). In front of a jeweled Greek cross in the center of the lunette, the Lamb of God, shown against a blue background and within a circular red and white mandorla, is supported by two angels, who are clad in light blue tunics and dark red mantles. In the extreme corners of the lunette appear the kneeling figures of Cain and Abel. The bearded figure of Cain, at the right, is clothed in a pale red tunic and yellow-green mantle and holds a bunch of wheat in the left hand. The beardless Abel, on the left, wears a light green tunic and brown mantle, brown hose, and white sandals. He holds a lamb in both hands and from a segment of a circle above his head appears the Dextera Domini. The lunette is framed by wavy blue clouds, and the figures are placed against a background with dark blue, black, yellow, and brown stripes. The two Gospel scenes on this end wall are less well preserved. They are placed on either side of the central window, the embrasure of which contains a white dove within an oval mandorla and a light blue foliate scroll on a red ground. The Adoration of the Magi is 27. A short inaccurate notice was made of these mural paintings in 1907, but since then this monument has passed quite unnoticed (Pedro Mata y Alvaro, Pinturas murales en Maderuelos, in Bol. esp. de ex., XV, 1907, pp. 135-137). I called attention to these mural paintings on December 29, 1928, in an address delivered before the eighteenth annual meeting of the College Art Association of America, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, and this was reported in The Art News, January 5, 1929, p. 24. The chapel has since been acquired by the Spanish government and declared a national monument.</page><page sequence="20">346 THE ART BULLETIN shown at the right underneath two arches. The Virgin is seated in a frontal position at the left and holds the Child in her lap. She is represented with a large yellow nimbus, white headdress, red tunic, and dark blue mantle. The figure of the Child is entirely destroyed except for the lower edge of His tunic, the feet, and a hand outstretched toward the Magus on the right. Only one of the three Magi is represented and he holds a bowl outstretched in both hands. He has a white beard, wears a dark blue jeweled crown, light blue tunic, and red mantle. At the left of the window Mary Magdalen washes the Saviour's feet with her hair. Christ, seated on a blue footstool, is represented with a yellow nimbus and red hair; He is clothed in a light blue tunic and dark green mantle with yellow lining, and He extends His right hand in a gesture of speech. The kneeling Magdalen, clad in a light red mantle, holds His feet with her left hand and drys them with her hair. Above her head appears the bust of an angel, who points downward. The figures are shown beneath an arch and against a background composed of red, yellow, and green stripes. Below this scene are traces of a painted curtain, proof that there were no additional scenes on the lower section of the wall. The side walls of the chapel were divided into three horizontal registers. The lowest register was undoubtedly embellished with a painted curtain which reached to the floor, but all traces of this have disappeared. Above this, in the second register, the twelve apostles were shown seated underneath arcades. On the north wall (Fig. 19) all six of the apostles are preserved, although the lower part of the figures has suffered much from moisture. On the south wall (Figs. 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27), two figures were destroyed when a window was cut through the wall and only the heads and shoulders of the remaining four apostles were preserved. On the north wall St. Peter, with white hair and beard, is shown at the extreme east end, and St. Paul and St. John are seated at the left. It is impossible to identify any of the remaining apostles by their attributes. Each is depicted with a nimbus, long tunic, and mantle, and with a book or scroll in one hand, while the other hand is raised in a gesture of teaching or speech. Some are represented with short hair and are beardless; others are bearded and have long hair which falls behind their shoulders. The arcades which shelter the apostles are almost identical with arcades portrayed in the frescoes from S. Baudel de Berlanga. The slender striped shafts rest on double bases and support a stilt block on which rests a semicircular capital. Above this rises a conical niche with windows and a crowning conch; between the niches runs a wall surmounted by crenelations. This wall appears to imitate Mud6jar brick work. Standing figures of archangels, seraphim, symbols of the evangelists, the Virgin, and church fathers are shown in the two upper registers on either side. On the north wall (Figs. 22-23) the Annunciation is shown at the left. The Virgin stands in a frontal position with left palm turned outward and right hand raised in a gesture of speech. She is clad in a pale red tunic, light blue mantle and white headdress. Gabriel, wearing a light blue tunic underneath a light yellow mantle, turns toward her in a three-quarters position and holds a red book in both hands. In the center of the composition a seraph, with body concealed beneath six long wings covered with eyes, holds a censer in either hand. The archangel on the right holds a long staff in the right hand and a scroll in the left. He has red and blue wings, and wears an orange nimbus, red tunic, and blue dalmatic, bordered</page><page sequence="21">FIG. 22-Maderuelo, Ermita de la Cruz: Annunciation on FIG. 23-Maderuelo, Ermita de la Cruz: Seraph on North North Wall of Apse Chapel Wall of Apse Chapel</page><page sequence="22">FIG. 24-Maderuelo, Ermita de la Cruz: Archangel on South FIG. 25-Maderuelo, Ermita de la Cruz: Archangel and Father Wall of Apse Chapel on South Wall of Apse Chapel</page><page sequence="23">FIG. 26-Maderuelo, Ermita de la Cruz: Heads of Apostles on South Wall of Apse Chapel FIG. 27--Maderuelo, Ermita de la Cruz: Heads of Apostles on South Wall of Apse Chapel</page><page sequence="24">FIG. 28-Maderuelo, Ermita de la Cruz: Majestas Domini on Vault of Apse Chapel</page><page sequence="25">ROMANESQUE SPANISH MURAL PAINTING (I) 351 with white. This register is closed on the right by the anthropomorphic symbol of St. Luke, who is depicted with the body of a man and the head of an ox with long horns. This figure is clad in a light blue tunic and brown mantle. Five similar figures are portrayed in the corresponding top register on the south wall. At the extreme left (Fig. 20) the anthropomorphic symbol of St. Mark, with the head of a lion, is shown in profile. He has red and green wings, he holds a book in both hands, and wears an orange nimbus, red tunic, and pale green mantle. The archangel on the right stands in a strictly frontal position and holds a scroll in the left hand and a long scepter in the right. The colors of the red tunic and blue dalmatic are singularly fresh and well preserved, whereas the figure of the seraph in the center of the composition (Fig. 21) is partially destroyed. The archangel to the right of the seraph is also damaged. Much of the original color of the upper part of the drapery has disappeared, but enough remains to show that the figure was clad in a white tunic and red mantle. The bishop saint, who closes the composition, is in a good state of preservation. He is depicted with an orange nimbus, short white hair, cut off above the shoulders, and white beard. A red alb is worn under a blue chasuble with white pallium adorned with crosses. The four walls of the apse are crowned by an imposing figure of the Majestas Domini, (Fig. 28), that fills the entire surface of the barrel vault. The Saviour is enthroned within a painted mandorla composed of a series of red, yellow, and white bands. He is seated on a cushioned throne, with feet resting on a blue footstool, against a dark red background, and is portrayed with a dark blue striped nimbus, pale red hair and beard, light blue tunic, and yellowish green mantle embellished with a rich border. In the left hand He holds an open copy of the Gospels, the pages of which are inscribed with the letters alpha and omega, and the right hand is raised in benediction. The mandorla, surrounded by red and blue clouds, is supported by four angels, who have red hair, red and white wings, yellow tunics, and pale red mantles. From the standpoint of iconography the mural paintings at Maderuelo add nothing new to the Spanish Romanesque tradition. The scenes represented are those common to the mediaeval repertoire, and their chief value lies in the fact that the cycle is fairly complete and has not suffered restoration. The position of the enthroned Majestas Domini, at the crown of the vault (Figs. i7, 28), recalls the Saviour in the vault of the small chapel of St. Martin de Fenouillar in Roussillon, where inscriptions accompany the angels supporting the mandorla.28 The representation of seraphim, archangels, and anthropomorphic symbols of the evangelists in the upper register of the north and south walls is similar to that found in the Catalan church of S. Maria de Tahull,29 where the anthropomorphic symbols of Mark and John, a seraph, and the archangel Gabriel are preserved in the upper register of the Gospel wall of the nave.30 The motif of apostles seated underneath anarcade is widespread in Spain; it is especially common on the Romanesque altar- frontals of Catalonia although more often in Catalan work the apostles are portrayed standing. 28. Gudiol, op. cit., 112, I13. 29. Gudiol, op. cit., fig. 65; Folch, CaUdlogo, fig. 167. 30. It is highly probable that the corresponding register on the opposite wall at Tahull, now lost, contained the archangel Raphael and the two other evangelistic symbols.</page><page sequence="26">352 THE ART BULLETIN The inclusion of Old Testament scenes is in accordance with the common mediaeval formula of paralleling the Old and New Law and was in common use in Spain during the Romanesque period.3" In Catalan art the Creation of Man is best illustrated by the Genesis cycle at Osomort,32 where this scene is accompanied by the inscription . . . LIMO TERRE ET INSPIRAVIT IN FACIEM EIVS. It is also found in one of the niches at S. Martin de Brull.33 The Temptation and Fall of Man is especially common in mediaeval Spain, and the variant found at Maderuelo, where Adam rests his chin on his hand in a gesture of doubt, appears in the late twelfth century Bible at Burgos,34 on a Catalan panel at Solsona,35 and on other Romanesque monuments. One of the best known Catalan examples of the Offering of Cain and Abel appears in an apse window from S. Maria de Mur, where the Dextera Domini is shown in the same manner as at Maderuelo. The figure of Abel with a lamb is also found in a mural painting from S. Maria de Tahull, where Abel holds the lamb on veiled hands and gazes up at the figure of the Saviour.36 The composition and style of these mural paintings at Maderuelo show an obvious relationship with the frescoes which until lately decorated the hermitage of S. Baudel de Berlanga, in the province of Soria. At Berlanga the mural decorations on the walls of the nave give the monument its chief significance, but it is the damaged fragment of painting (Fig. 16) in the apse, or east chapel, that shows the close relationship with the scenes at Maderuelo. This east apse at Berlanga, raised above the level of the nave, measures 4.1o x 3.60 meters and is covered by a barrel vault. There is evidence that originally the entire surface of the three walls and ceiling was painted, but nothing remains except the composition on the end wall. The preservation of the decoration on this wall is due solely to the fact that in the sixteenth century it was covered by a coat of whitewash and pro- tected by a large retable placed behind the altar. Although the composition in the semicircular lunette on the east wall at Berlanga is in an advanced stage of deterioration, enough remains to show that this was almost identical to that found in the lunette of the east wall at Maderuelo. A Greek cross, with a circular nimbus at the center, is supported by angels and at the sides two figures, wearing short tunics, hose and slippers, lean forward. The identity of these two figures cannot be determined with certainty, but it is quite probable that they represent the offering of Cain and Abel (cf. Fig. 18). A white dove within a mandorla is placed at the top of the window in the same manner as a Maderuelo, although the position of the dove's body is reversed, with the head pointed downward. The embrasures of the window are embellished with a "fan" motif composed of radiating bands of red, white, and yellow. On either side of the window are seated figures of saints: at the left, St. Nicholas (. . . AVS) and at the right St. Baudelio (BAVDILI), whereas at Maderuelo this register contains the Epiphany and the Washing of Christ's Feet by the Magdalen. The small rectangular panel directly beneath the window at Berlanga contains a decorative bird resembling an ibis, and beneath are traces of an inscription: IN DEI NOMINE . . . AVLA DEI . . . At Maderuelo the decoration beneath the window has been lost, but it is highly probable that a similar panel with an animal motif was shown here. 31.

The two apses are almost identical in size and it is even possible that one might reconstruct the lost paintings in the east apse at Berlanga on the basis of the preserved mural decora- tion at Maderuelo. Both chapels are covered by a barrel vault and it is highly probable that the ceiling at Berlanga contained a Majestas Domini. Further evidence of a close community of school is shown by a comparison of the figure and drapery style, the treatment of architectural motives, and the use of color in these two Castilian hermitages. Some of the heads of the seated apostles on the north and south walls at Maderuelo (Figs. 19, 26, 27) are almost duplicated in the Gospel scenes in the nave (cf. Entry into Jerusalem, Last Supper, of Berlanga); the head of Christ in the scene of the Washing of His feet by the Magdalen at Maderuelo is analogous to that of the Saviour in the Temptation of Christ and the Raising of Lazarus at Baudelio. The curious convention at Maderuelo of dressing the hair in a small puff above the forehead (head of St. Peter, Fig. 19; head of Christ in the Washing of His feet, Fig. 18) is identical with the treatment found in the Berlanga Last Supper and other scenes. The head of St. Jerome on the north wall at Maderuelo closely resembles the head of St. Nicholas in the apse of Berlanga. In the drapery treatment there are also many analogies between the Maderuelo and Berlanga series. Reminiscences of the Moissac "flying fold" are evident in the manner in which at Maderuelo the lower edges of the tunics turn upward, although the drapery falls heavily and is handled in the plastic fashion so common at Berlanga and in Castilian manuscripts of the late twelfth century. The color scheme, with a liberal use of reds, oranges, and yellows, is the same in both series of mural paintings and a further striking resemblance is shown in the treatment of the arcades which are placed above many of the scenes at Maderuelo. There is no definite document by which the mural paintings can be accurately dated, nor is anything known of the artists who executed these series. Maderuelo was a depend- ency of the monastery of S. Pedro de Arlanza,37 where an artist by the name of Gudesteo was at work in the eleventh century. In view of the relationship between Maderuelo and Arlanza it is quite conceivable that this chapel was decorated by artists sent from Arlanza, but the complete loss of all Romanesque painting in the latter monastery makes this a mere supposition. The frescoes at Maderuelo show all the characteristics of the late Romanesque style. The treatment of the drapery, with the liberal use of the "flying fold," reveals the strong current of the Romanesque tradition, but the sureness and swiftness of handling indicate clearly that the artist was following a thoroughly integrated style. Although most of the heads are shown in a frontal position, they are rendered in a sure and sophisticated manner. This, together with the unusual stature of many of the figures, produces a naturalistic effect which betrays the influence of approaching Gothic. It is, in fact, this sophisticated handling of the human figure, rather than any single detail of the drapery or figure style which would make it impossible to date the series earlier than the first half or middle of the thirteenth century. 37. I am indebted for this information to Sr. D. Luciano Huidobr6 y Serna of Burgos.</page><page sequence="30">356 THE ART BULLETIN VI. Another Castilian fresco which came to light on the expedition of 1927 was found in a small church at Tubilla del Agua, province of Burgos. This small hamlet lies about fifty kilometers north of Burgos, not far from Sedano, and is on the main road to Santander.38 The small church, now falling into ruin, appears to date from the twelfth century, although the small atrium may be even earlier. The upper section of the square tower contains interesting fragments of Romanesque sculpture (Fig. 30). This was a royal founda- tion, built for nuns, and contains many features found in other convents in the region of Palencia, such as S. Andres de Arroyo and S. Eufemia de Cozuelos (Palencia), and the abbey of Rodilla. As these convents in Palencia were built for royalty, it is highly probable that this was also true of Tubilla del Agua. It was a dependency of the convent of S. F6 at Toledo.39 The vaults of the small nave of the church at Tubilla del Agua have now fallen (Fig. 31) and a small patch of mural decoration has been recently freed from a thick coat of white- wash. The space uncovered, about three feet in width by five in height, is on the Gospel wall, facing the main entrance, and below this is a niche which formerly contained a sepulcher.40 The composition consists of two standing figures of archangels, enclosed within a dark red border (Fig. 32). The angel on the right, probably St. Michael, is represented with a yellow nimbus, red hair and wings, and is clothed in red and yellow robes. He holds a blue shield and with a long spear pierces the dragon which lies at his feet. Another angel, at the left, with a green nimbus, red and yellow robes, also holds a spear in his hand. The figures are relieved against a striped background composed of light red, yellow, and dark red bands. The angels are drawn in graceful lines and the colors are exceedingly harmonious. The style and color scheme of this work shows clearly that the artist was following the manuscript traditions of this region, and the freedom and sureness of execution indicate a date in the thirteenth century. Constant exposure to sun and air, however, is doing its work and if the faded fresco is not shortly transferred or removed to a local museum nothing will remain of this rare example of the Romanesque school of Castile. 38. It lies on the right bank of the river Uzaron (Rudr6n), and contains not more than eight hundred inhabitants. There was once a lake here, whence the name (Madoz, Diccionario, XV, p. 172). 39. I am indebted for this information to Sr. D. Luciano Huidobr6 Serna of Burgos. 40. This sepulcher appears to have been a common burial tomb for the nuns. The tomb has been torn out and the space is now filled with human skulls and bones.</page></plain_text>
