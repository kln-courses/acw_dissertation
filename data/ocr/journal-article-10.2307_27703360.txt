<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INFLUENCE OF JEAN PAUL RICHTER ON GEORGE MEREDITH'S CONCEP TION OF THE COMIC Critical comment on George Meredith has from the begin ning associated his name with that of Jean Paul Richter, both to affirm and to deny traces of what critics usually deplore as the unfortunate influence of Germany's great humorist on Meredith's style. For the most part the matter has rested there and little attention has been paid to the possibility of a deeper influence at work. And yet both writers have this in common that each, successful as a creative artist in comic narrative, likewise paused midway in his career as a writer to survey critically the nature of the comic. Thus in the one case in The Essay on Comedy (1877) and in the other in chapters VI-IX inclusive of the Vorschule der Aesthetik we are furnished not only with a commentary to their own practice but with two distinct contributions to our under standing of the comic. Furthermore, strange as it may seem, these two men were much alike both in their art and in their attitude to life. Hence that portion of Jean Paul's work which most vitally touched Meredith's own art, namely his analysis of the comic, may well be looked to as having influenced to some extent Meredith's own discussion of the subject. Some years ago in Germany1 attention was called to the striking similarity in phrase and imagery between certain chap ters of the Vorschule and the Essay on Comedy. No attempt was made, however, to analyse the content of either, but influence was assumed on the merely external aspect of the problem. A re-studying of the whole matter seems to show a much more vital connection between the two theories. At the beginning it should be noted that nowhere in Mere dith's works or correspondence does he speak of the Vorschule der Aesthetik, and only once does he mention Jean Paul by name. It is significant, nevertheless, that this occurs in the Essay on Comedy, where he singles out Richter's Siebenk?s as furnishing "the best edition of the German comic."2 Hence the evidence of any connection between the Vorschule and the Essay is mainly 1 B.

Such an omission of any acknowledgment of his sources is, however, by no means foreign to his practice.3 In fact, at times, he deliberately takes pains to conceal specific reference to work and author. As to sources they seem to have covered nearly the same ground. The major contributions to the subject from antiquity to modern times have been drawn upon by both writers. Of the theoretical works Meredith makes no mention. Jean Paul, on the other hand, is in this matter most explicit.3* For literary examples they have, in general, turned to the same representa tives of ancient, mediaeval, and modern literatures. Aside from English literature where Meredith is, of course, most at home, there are, however, some exceptions. Thus although both writers have considerable to say of Aristophanes, Jean Paul makes no mention of Menander to whom Meredith frequently refers. On the other hand, Jean Paul in his survey includes Scandinavian drama which Meredith totally neglects, and finds Holberg worthy of a place beside Moli?re. This omission on Meredith's part is the more surprising since he exhibits a better understanding than Jean Paul of Moli?re's genius and might, therefore, have been expected in such an inclusive study of the subject to have shown some interest in the "Danish Moli?re" as well. Nor has Meredith followed Jean Paul in his judgment of German writers. Although they both3b agree as to the "light of the comic" in Goethe, Jean Paul's estimate of Lessing as "der wahre deutsche Plautus"30 stands in sharp contrast to Mere dith's rather harsh verdict of him as a writer of comedy.3d In short, such differences only serve to indicate more clearly that, whatever agreement there may be in literary examples is rather the result of the thorough study each writer made of the comic than any conscious effort on Meredith's part to cover Jean Paul's sources. 8 cf. Essay, Introd. p. 21, where attention is called to his altering "an emi nent Frenchman, M.

I Briefly the parallelism may be surveyed under two heads, namely imagery and similarity in phrasing. As to the former, three instances are quite unique in their application to the comic and demand inclusion here. The dominant and most characteristic poetic image of the Essay on Comedy is the conception of a Comic Spirit whose func tion it is to survey the sphere of man's activities in search of the comic. The conception as a whole is Mereditr?s own, but Jean Paul's figurative mode of expression may have foreshadowed somewhat its imagery. Speaking not of the comic, but of humor, Jean Paul says: "Der Humor ist ein Geist der das Ganze durch zieht und unsichtbar beseelt."4 It is "ein wahrer humoristischer Weltgeist"6 or simply "ein komischer Weltgeist."6 Meredith depicts the spirit as hovering above society;7 it is for him the "spirit overhead."8 Jean Paul discussing humor and irony points to a Weltironie, "welche .... ?ber allem Wissen singend und spielend schwebt; gleich einer Flamme frei, verzehrend und erfreuend,."9 And later in speaking of wit and the chaos of ideas from which it springs he uses the same figure . . . ."wenn zwar ein Chaos da ist, aber dar?ber ein Heiliger Geist, welcher schwebt."10 Both make use of the figure of the chase to illustrate the comic. It is to one "das komische Gnadenwildpret, das von den Schweizer Bergen bis in die belgische Ebene l?uft;"11 to the other "Folly is the natural prey of the Comic,"12 and "it is with the springing delight of hawk over heron, hound after fox, that it 4 Jean Paul Richter, Jean Pauls Werke, Auswahl in 8 Th.

"Comedy," says Meredith,17 "laughs through the mind, for the mind directs it," hence he suggests that it be called the "humor of the mind." Jean Paul defines the comic as "der Genuss oder die Phantasie und Poesie des Verstandes."18 Contempt, Meredith tells us is foreign to comic intelligence,19 and Jean Paul finds the comic "Zur Verachtung zu unwichtig und zum Hasse zu gut."20 Where Jean Paul observes that the comic has "ein dermassen freigelassenes Spiel, dass er's an gelieb ten und geachteten Personen treiben kann, ohne sie zu verseh ren,"21 Meredith, in strikingly similar phrasing, points to the comic which "enables one to detect the ridicule of them you love without loving them less."22 The comic poet demands a receptive audience, for "you must love pure comedy" to understand it, and be "receptive to the ideas of comedy."23 Thus Meredith and likewise Jean Paul: "eine gutm?tige offene Aufnahme ist dem poetischen Komiker vonn?ten"24?and he speaks of "die zuvor kommende Liebe f?r den Komiker"25 necessary for a correct appreciation of his work. Meredith sees folly the booty of the comic "perpetually sliding into new shapes"26 and Jean Paul refers to the comic poet as "dem immer neuen Darsteller der immer neuen Abweichungen."27 Meredith points to a "comic that refines even to pain"28 and according to Jean Paul "sogar das Komische in der Kunst kann den geistigen Kitzel bis an die N?he des geistigen Schmerzens treiben."29 13 Ibid., p. 140. 14 Ibid., p. 142. 15 Ibid., p. 143. 16 Vorschule, p. 114. 17 Essay, p. 141. 18 Vorschule, p. 114. 19 Essay, p. 120. 20 Vorschule, p. 103, cf. also p. 109. 21 Vorschule, p. 114. 22 Essay, p. 133. 23 /6?d., p. 106. 24 Vorschule, p. 123. 26 JWtf., p. 123. 26 Essay, p. 119. 27 Vorschule, p. 123. 28 Essay,p. 111. 29 Vorschule, p. 112.</page><page sequence="5">The Influence of Jean Paul Richter 247 Both stress at length the factor of freedom in the cultivation of the comic. The comic game is found, Jean Paul cautions, only "auf der freien Heide;"30 the comic demands "innerliche und ?usserliche Freiheit" and where "D?rftigkeit und Sklaverei des wahren komisch-poetischen Geistes" persists, no comic is pos sible; the comic makes "heiter und frei"31 and enjoys a "frei gelassenes Spiel." Meredith not only demands social freedom as a condition for the growth of the comic but makes comedy the test of the degree of civilisation attained by a people.32 He even goes further and as the protagonist of woman's rights in the social structure concludes "that where women have no social free dom comedy is absent."33 Jean Paul surveying modern French literature styles wit its "Weiberseite."34 But wit he had earlier pointed out is contingent upon universality of ideas, what he called "eine Gemeinschaft der Ideen wie der Weiber in Piatons Republik"34*, and this in turn upon "H?flichkeit und Bildung,"340 in the promotion of which women must needs play an important r?le. Hence he urges for the development of wit among the Germans that " M?nner und Weiber m?ssen sich nicht wie ?l und Wasser fliehen; Weiber als geborene Weltleute machen den Mann gesellig, so bald er sie sucht."340 For Meredith the failure of the German men "to consent, as in France, to talk on equal terms with their women, and to listen to them"34d has inhibited not alone the cultivation of wit but of comedy as well. In the discussion of irony, satire, and humor we again find marked parallelism. "The foppish irony fretting to be seen, and the irony which leers, that you shall not mistake its intention" are, according to Meredith, "failures in satiric effort pretend ing to the treasures of ambiguity."35 According to Jean Paul "Die Ironie s?ndigt gleich, wenn sie das blosse t?richte Gesicht, oder wenn sie die blosse ernste Maske dar?ber zeigt."36 And later he cautions an ironical writer against "ein Vordringen und Durchschimmern des Lachgesichtes durch die d?nne Maske der Ironie."37 Satire is distinguished for both by its moral purpose. Jean Paul says, "Die Satire z?chtigt. Man findet sich sittlich 80 Ibid., p. 128. 31 Ibid., p. 108. 32 Essay, p. 141 &amp; p. 145. * Ibid., p. 118. 34 Vorscfade, p. 294. 34a Ibid., p. 178.

With Meredith this be comes a "satiric rod"41a and like Jean Paul who calls attention to the "Schlag der Satire"42 Meredith characterizes the laughter of satire as "a blow in the back or face."43 They both make the same distinctions as to humor. Mere dith notes of the humorist that "finite and infinite flash from one to the other with him"44, and Jean Paul speaks of the laughter which arises "wenn er mit der kleinen (Welt), wie der Humor tut, die unendliche ausmisset und verkn?pft."45 "The stroke of the great humorist is world-wide, with lights of tragedy in his laughter."46 Thus Meredith, and in similar vein Jean Paul: "Der Humor geht auf dem niedrigen Sokkus, aber oft mit der tragi schen Maske, wenigstens in der Hand."47 "Humorists are given to be sentimental;"48 they exhibit "sometimes a larmoyant geniality, not unmanly in its verging upon tenderness."49 With Jean Paul it is "der empfindungsvolle Humorist"50 and he men tions his "Gutm?tigkeit"51 and the "fremdartige Einmengung der Herzenssprache"52 in his speech, what Meredith calls "the richer laugh of heart and mind in53 one." The humorist, Mere dith notes, in his treatment of a comic person owes "his like ness to you, and yours to your neighbor."54 Jean Paul says: "Der Humorist kann seine eigne Verwandschaft mit der Mensch heit sich nicht leugnen."55 This does not exhaust the parallelisms but enough has been adduced to show its general character. To this surface similarity in viewpoint may be added, however, a more vital correspond 38 Vorschule, p. 109. 99 Vorschule, p. 108. 40 Essay, p. 132-3. 41 Vorschule, p. 109. 41ft Essay, p. 134. 42 Vorschule, p. 108. 43 JEsjay, p. 140. 44 /t?*., p. 137. 45 Vorschule, p. 120. 46 ??ay, p. 137. 47 Vorschule, p. 120. 48 Essay, p. 138. 49 Ibid., p. 133. 80 Vorschule, p. 120. w Ibid., p. 124. 62 Ibid., p. 124. 63 Essay, p. 147. 54 Eway, p. 134. * Vorschule, p. 119.</page><page sequence="7">The Influence of Jean Paul Richter 249 ence in the inner structure of their theory as to the comic. A brief survey of their theories will make this clear. II In the sixth chapter of the Vorschule der Aesthetik Jean Paul defines and discusses the nature of the ludicrous (Das L?cher liche), or, more accurately speaking, the comic, since he is primarily concerned with the ludicrous as suitable for use in art; in particular, poetic narrative. Although not always consistent in the use of the terms, he is, in fact, conscious of this distinction56 between das L?cherliche and das Komische. Thus in his explana tion of the source of pleasure in the ludicrous, he speaks of the aesthetic comic as being the "sch?nere Tochter,"57 of das L?cher liche, however, as "die ?hnliche Mutter."58 The first part of the inquiry is negative in nature. The var ious attempts at definition are taken up and their several short comings discussed. Dissatisfied for th? most part with all previous efforts, he proceeds to fix the salient characteristics of the comic for himself. His approach to the subject, like that of Aristotle and Kant, leads first to a consideration of the effect of the comic upon the observer.59 The comic is, he notes, concerned with unwisdom or folly. In order to impress the observer, however, folly must be 56 Recent writers seem to favor this distinction in meaning: Sully, An Essay on Laughter, London, Longmans, Green&amp;Co., 1907, p. 86, points out that "a comic spectacle is a presentation which is choice, which comes up to the requirements of art, and would be excellent material for comedy." Greig, The Psychology of Laughter and Comedy, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1923, p. 70, defines the comic as "the laughable raised to a higher power and made fit for the uses of art." Gregory, The Nature of Laughter, New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; Co., 1924, p. 224, speaks of the "aesthetic status of laughter as comic laughter", cf. also Diet. Phil. Psychol. I, 198, ed. Mark Baldwin, 1911. 67 Vorschule, p. 114. 68 Ibid., p. 112. 69 Even Lipps, who is inclined to minimize the emotional element in the comic process, clearly indicates the basis for such an approach: "Das Wort 'komisch* will allgemein gesagt, zun?chst nicht wie das Wort 'blau* eine Eigen schaft bezeichnen, die an einem Gegenstande angetroffen wird, sondern die Wirkung angeben, die der Gegenstand auf unser Gem?t aus?bt. Freilich muss dieser Wirkung irgendwelche Beschaffenheit des Gegenstandes zu Grunde hegen. Insofern dies der Fall ist, heisst dann auch die Beschaffenheit selbst oder der Tr?ger derselben komisch." cf. Komik und Humor, (Beitr?ge zur ?sthetik VI), Leipzig, 1898, p. 1.</page><page sequence="8">250 Brewer made sensuously perceptible either through some action or in some situation which falsely represents in one case the intention, in the other, the opinion (die Meinung) of the comic object with regard to it60 (i.e. such act or situation). Neither mistakes, nor pure ignorance, however, are of themselves comic; the mistake must first be made to reveal itself through an endeavor, or through some action. Thus, a healthy man who considers himself sick becomes a comic figure only by means of the precautionary meas ures taken for his fancied illness. Only in this manner is the contrast raised to "comic heights."61 The contrast between what is intended and the actual situa tion itself is, for Jean Paul, not yet an "infinite incongruity" and hence not comic. It is at this point that he introduces a new fac tor into his analysis, which later theorists have discredited: namely, the "lending" of our own insight and view of the matter to the comic object whose action in contrast thereto produces the incongruity. It was a cardinal belief of Jean Paul that the actions of an individual must be according to his conviction as to their expediency.62 But actions so viewed objectively cannot im press one as comic. "Denn kein Mensch kann im gegebnen Falle nach etwas anderem handeln, als nach seiner Vorstellung davon."62a Not until the observer has ascribed or "lent" his own superior knowledge of the actual situation or endeavor is the "infinite incongruity" produced which is comic. To illustrate this idea Jean Paul takes the following episode from Don Quixote. When Sancho held himself suspended over a shallow ditch throughout the night because he fancied an abyss yawned beneath him, his action was reasonable from the stand point of his assumption, and he would have been mad to risk destruction by letting go. But why then do we laugh? We lend to his endeavor our insight and true view of the situation and thereby produce by this contradiction between his action and our knowledge of the situation ascribed to him an infinite in 60 Vorschule, p. 103. w Ibid., p. 104. 62 cf. Berend, Jean Pauls ?sthetik, Forschungen zur neueren Literaturge schichte, Berlin, 1909, p. 224. 620 Vorschule, p. 104. 63 That this apparently does not appear as one of Sancho's adventures in exactly this form detracts in no way from its value for this purpose.

Our self-deception whereby we predicate a contrary knowledge as the basis for the strange action makes it that minimum of intelligence, the ob jective, irrational thing about which we laugh.64 Thus according to Jean Paul we laugh, not at a real absurdity but an hypotheti cal one which we attribute to an individual by ascribing to him our way of looking at the matter. It is, he concludes, to this fact that the comic owes its essentially anthropomorphic character, since only men and the more clever beasts readily permit of such a "lending'' of our superior insight to them.65 According to Jean Paul the pleasure in the comic arises not from a feeling of pride, as Hobbes would have us believe, but from the enjoyment of three series of thoughts closely associated with a single perception:66 our own view, that of the other per son, and the thought ascribed to him by us. The objectivation of the comic compels us to toy alternately with these thoughts,but, because of their irreconcilable nature, this compulsion soon passes over into a lively freedom of choice. Hence with a characteristic lapse into metaphorical language, he defines the comic now, as the enjoyment or poetry of the untrammeled intellect "welcher sich an drei Schluss- oder Blumenketten spie lend entwickelt und daran hin und wieder tanzt."67 Since Lotze68 has given, for the purposes of this paper, the most incisive and, at the same time, constructive criticism of Jean Paul's theory, it is well at this juncture to refuse, as he laconically does, to join in this dance proposed by Jean Paul, and instead, to focus our attention on the main objection to such a theory. Lotze at once seizes upon the so-called "lending" in the comic process as being untenable and misleading. If ignorance, he says, no matter how objectively it may be presented to us, fails to arouse our sense of the comic, it cannot be made to do so by merely increasing the degree of it. If we "lend" to the person, whose action appears to us incongruous, our own view of the situation of which he is ignorant, then his action at once becomes 64 Vorschule, p. 104. 66 Ibid., p. 107.

It is not our knowledge of the true state of affairs which we ascribe or "lend" to him, but the serious consciousness of being a nature capable, generally speaking, of formulating plans and adequately carrying them out under favourable cir cumstances. The significant thing to note here, is, as Lipps69 has remarked, the emphasis which Lotze placed on the phrase "generally speaking." Thus Sancho, being a man, is judged by us as we are wont in general to judge men. Human actions, however, apart from occasional disturbing conditions generally lay claim to a certain fitness or expediency; that is, we "lend" or ascribe to them this assumption. This, then, is what we, at first glance, lend to Sancho's action; an assumption, which in con trast with the actual inexpediency of his action produces the incongruity about which we laugh. That Jean Paul introduced the act of "lending"70 into the theory shows that he sensed some thing of this meaning; he failed, however, to see that his inter pretation nullified the comic effect. We shall have occasion later in the discussion of George Meredith's view of the comic to return to this corrected version of Jean Paul's use of the so called "comic lending." The crux of Jean Paul's theory of the comic, like most of the theories from Aristotle to the present day, is thus seen to center around some sort of contrast. Jean Paul's failure to appraise correctly the true nature of this contrast, although his attempt to introduce the factor of "lending," shows that he sensed its implication of an assumed or pretended value,71 was undoubt 69 Lipps, op. cit., p. 61. 70 Volkelt associates this act of "komisches Leihen" with a characteristic phenomenon of aesthetic experience by identifying it with "Einf?hlung," with what aestheticians have been wont to call "empathie response" (cf. Langfeld, The Aesthetic Attitude, New York, Harcourt Brace &amp; Howe, 1920, p. 120). Thus, that we feel into the dented top hat aslant the head of the tipsy man, the false claim to dignity and importance, is not more surprising than that we look upon a fir tree as striving upwards, or a tiny cloud as blissfully dreaming along. Cf. Volkelt, System der ?sthetik, -M?nchen, Otto Beck, 1910, 2 Bd., p. 377. 71 Volkelt, (op. cit. p. 39), whose analysis of the comic, seems, in general to account adequately for its various forms, seizes upon this contrast which centers around an assumed or apparent value as the very heart of the comic. It is this assumption of value or apparent worth inherent in the contrast itself which points, according to Volkelt, to the anthropomorphic character of the</page><page sequence="11">The Influence of Jean Paul Richter 253 edly occasioned by the narrow standpoint he took in the begin ning with regard to the ludicrous; only the irrational, (ein sinnlich angeschauter, unendlicher Unverstand) according to Jean Paul, producing the effect of the ludicrous. Thus in its essence Jean Paul's theory has much in common with Bergson's stress on the intellectual character of the comic effect, and also, as we shall soon see, with Meredith's insistence on the intellectual rather than upon the emotional character of our pleasure in the comic.72 In fact, Bergson's frequent reduction of the sources of the comic to some form of "automatism,"73 that is "something mechanical encrusted upon the living,"74 as well as the element of "rigidity"75 is also suggested by Jean Paul to account for certain aspects of the comic of situation. "L?cherlich," he says, "ist ferner maschinen-m?ssig Abh?ngigkeit des Geistigen von der Maschine (z.B. so lange zu predigen bis man ausd?nstet)? ferner die Verwandlung eines lebendigen Wesens in ein Ab straktes (z.B. etwas Blaues sass auf dem Pferde)."76 In stressing the intellectual aspect of the comic Jean Paul was simply con forming to the "characteristically German"77 approach to the problem which had derived its initial impulse from Kant's inquiry into the ludicrous in wit. Ill Meredith's approach to the subject is in the last analysis that of Jean Paul: namely, what effect does the comic (in this case the type of comedy he has in mind) have upon the observer. Like Jean Paul he is at once impressed by the subjective aspect of the comic. Thus the part played by the observer in the re cording of the comic impression becomes extremely important to Meredith and furnishes the real clue to his conception. For Meredith, as for Jean Paul, the comic is thus anthropo morphic by nature. It is concerned with the folly of man in fact, comic and, at the same time, indicates in the comic process, not only a play of ideas, but an emotional reaction as well. 72 Cf. in this connection Lane Cooper, An Aristotelian Theory of Comedy, N. Y., Harcourt Brace &amp; Co., 1922, p. 80. 73 Henri Bergson, Laughter, N. Y., Macmillan Co., 1924, p. 25. 74 Bergson, Ibid., p. 37. i* Ibid., p. 23. 7? Vorschule, note 2, p. 107.

Such acts or situations lay claim to, or pretend to be what they are not.78 Hence, they have in them some sort of contrast. Such a contrast, however, between what they actually are and what they pretend to be does not become truly comic until such acts are viewed as the product of a society grounded in common sense. When we perceive that such acts or situations are opposed to what we as people of common sense would do or say, these contrasts strike us then as comic, that is, as contravening common sense and hence are susceptible of ridicule. It is at once apparent that by common sense Meredith understands something more than mere "normal understand ing."79 While this is fundamental in the meaning of the term, a person of common sense is for Meredith further endowed with the ability to view himself and the society about him objec tively, that is, with a certain detachment from the issues in volved. Ability to detect the comic, Meredith finds, is in fact conditioned by "an esteem for common sense."80 Thus, he says: "You must?believe that our state of society is founded in com mon sense, otherwise you will not be struck by the contrasts the comic spirit perceives, or have it to look to for your consola tion".81 Here then is the heart of Meredith's conception of the comic. In other words the comic arises for Meredith when the con trast between what is and what is pretended is heightened by our ascribing or "lending" to the person concerned the common sense which we as members of society are endowed with, and by which our actions are judged. We have here as the essence of Meredith's conception of the comic something which resembles very closely Jean Paul's insistence upon the factor of "lending" as a necessary step in his own theory. It will be recalled that in Jean Paul's theory this served to show how an act or situation came to impress the observer as comic.82 His interpretation,how ever, we found destroyed the comic effect. 78 Essay, cf. p. 139-142. 79 J.

Like Jean Paul he sees inherent in the comic an incongruity between the act and the intention of the comic object. In so far as such an act represents the belief of the comic object as to its expediency, for Meredith as for Jean Paul, it cannot be said to be comic. It may appear to us as foolish but not comic. Unlike Jean Paul, Meredith does not at this point attempt to make the contrast comic by increasing the degree of foolishness, but by assuming that it arose from the action of one presumably endowed like ourselves with common sense. By "believing," as Meredith insisted, such to be the case, we have, as it were, lent him the assumption. The fact that the action in contrast to this assumption stands revealed through the ensuing comic contrast as an absurdity also stamps our assumption as false in this instance. But the comic effect is not altered in the least for we still assume that, in general, the actions of a member of a society so constituted will be prompted by common sense ; hence, we are justified in continuing to make such an assump tion. The comic contrast has merely served to indicate in a particular instance how tenuous is our hold on the claim of being a society made up of common sense individuals. The comic so viewed offers one the necessary corrective whereby this claim may be vindicated. What we have here as the heart of Meredith's idea of the comic is not, however, Jean Paul's interpretation of the "comic lending," but the corrected version of Lotze. Thus Lotze's stress upon our "lending" to the comic object "the serious conscious ness of being a nature capable generally speaking of formulating plans and adequately carrying them out" is the interpretation (enlarged somewhat by the unique idea of common sense) which Meredith likewise read into Jean Paul's theory. Like Lotze he saw the fallacy in Jean Paul's argument and sensing its true meaning, he proceeded to adapt it to his own characteristic interpretation of the comic. Whether he saw the corrected version of Lotze or not is beside the point.
