Figure 1 shows  the percentage of children passing the false belief  test as a function of age in four different countries:  Canada, Samoa, India, and Peru (Callaghan et al.,  2005). It is not until after age 6 that all children reli- ably pass the false belief test.

Theory-of-mind did not have the publication  density back when he was writing that it does today,  so it would have been easy to overlook. This review  is not the place to rewrite Jaynes’s theory. So I will  just suggest that reflexive awareness of mental states  such as beliefs, desires, memories, and intentions  would have a natural place alongside the analog “I”  and metaphor “me.”  I would now like to use what we have learned to  discuss the historical part of Julian Jaynes’s theory  of consciousness.

But  over the years, Jaynes stood his ground on the strong  form of his theory for good reason. The weak form  is almost unfalsifiable. If you present a theory to the  world, it should be in disprovable form. The strong  form is also preferred because it has more explana- tory power. It includes many historical phenomena  that may or may not be in the causal chain of the  evolution of consciousness but are ignored at the  risk of losing valuable insights into the varieties of  conscious experience.  So Jaynes leaves open the possibility that what he  calls consciousness could have arisen in other places in  ways less dependent on the bicameral mind. For exam- ple, there could have been isolated groups in the world  that did not develop a settled agricultural way of life  and did not experience the social disruption from rap- idly mixing cultures. Over long periods of time these  groups could acquire the features of consciousness for  reasons other than the increased task demands of ag- riculture and the interpersonal dissonance associated  with clashing cultures. But possibility and probability  are two different things. And when Jaynes looked at all  the data available from the ancient Near East and Asia,  he found strong support for bicamerality.

And Kuijt, writing about the same time  period, says, “It is important to note that many, if not  most, of the large LPPNB village communities in the  south-central Levant were abandoned at some point  between 8000 and 7750 B.P., with new, and usually  smaller, hamlets founded at the beginning of the Pot- tery Neolithic” (Kuijt, 2000, p. 94).

Instead we see the intensification of statuary,  busts, and icons. We will end this section by giving a  Jaynesian description of events during this period of  time.  The cognitive demands of an incipient agrarian  lifestyle would have put great stress on the mental  capacities of the hunter–gatherers of the ancient  Near East. The established cueing mechanism for  increased task demands and for guidance in moments  of uncertainty was the hallucinated voice of a parent  or a group leader. Recall the difficulty, pointed out  by Jaynes earlier, of constructing something as simple  as a fish weir. Pleistocene man, Jaynes said, would  forget what he was doing. The death of a leader could  have been a frightening loss of the ability to “refresh”  or maintain guiding commands or admonishments. Figure 7.
