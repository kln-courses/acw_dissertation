<plain_text><page sequence="1">Environmental Stimuli and the Responses of Parasitic Helminths Ralph E. Thorson The parasitologist, although he is most frequently linked with the medi- cal profession, is, in fact (and I suspect few would openly admit it), a practicing ecologist. This is especially true when only the parasite is considered either outside or inside the host. Since this is the case, it would be well to consider the types of environments and environ- mental associations which should be studied by the parasitologist. These may be divided into two types: (1) the ex- ternal environment and its effects on free living stages of parasites, and (2) the internal environment encountered by the parasite in the host or hosts (Otto, 1958). The variety of external environments which influence a parasite's free exist- ence and the subsequent availability of a host is remarkably diverse, ranging from purely aquatic to the rather loosely moist environment of mud or wet to damp foliage. It is rare that a truly arid environment is involved but ex- ceptions occur even to this statement. It is likewise apparent that the micro- environment suitable for parasites may differ markedly from the macroenviron- ment. In addition, the temperature in the environment ranges from the obvi- ously tropical to temperate and even to arctic. One feels that as the parasite enters a host, homeostatic control will make the environment more stable, but detailed consideration of the internal microenvironment of the stomach, small intestine, caecum, and large intestine reveal marked differences in possible environmental stimuli. Also, in any The author is a professor in the Department of Biology, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Ind. This is the third paper from the symposium "Ecosystems - Evolution and Revolution." See January 1969 issue for first two papers. one of these areas, the environment may change markedly from the epithelial surface to the lumen of the organ. If parasites were restricted to the intestine, the variety of stimuli would, even though still complex, be limited. How- ever, there is hardly an organ of the body which is not susceptible to some parasitic infection for all or part of the internal life cycle. Needless to say, the variety of internal environmental stimuli is great. To survey all the possibilities of such stimuli is not possible, but we shall endeavor to select examples which illus- trate the importance of such stimuli and I hope we will be forgiven if we seem to emphasize some of the more bizarre relationships. Frequently these are the best studied. Likewise, some of the areas of our ignorance will be mentioned. Al- though the title of this paper implies a survey of helminths' responses to stimuli, some especially interesting ex- amples in the fields of protozoology and entomology will be cited. Complications of Life Cycles One of the complicating factors in a discussion of this kind is the wide range of life cycle types we see. First of all, there is the completely closed or in- ternal life cycle in which only one host is involved; if another host is involved, it is by ingestion of the original host --Trichinella spiralis is the best ex- ample of this type. Second, there is the life cycle which has varying periods of external development and then an in- ternal cycle--classic examples of this type are the hookworms of man and domestic animals (Necator, Ancylos- toma) and many others of the gastro- intestinal parasites of man, domestic and wild animals. Third, there are forms which have one or several external pe- riods plus two internal cycles - these are forms which utilize intermediate hosts. Examples are Spirocerca lupi of the dog, Metastrongylus - lung worms of pigs, trematode and filariid parasites of man and animals. The extent of the time spent in the external environment varies widely in these examples but, most important, the different internal stimuli of such diverse hosts as arthro- pods, molluscs, and mammals give one pause as to the evolutionary mallea- bility of these parasitic species. A fourth type of life cycle not particularly im- portant in helminth forms is the rather pronounced external part of the cycle exhibited by many parasitic arthropods such as mosquitoes and other biting flies with but a short period of attach- ment to the host simply for getting a blood meal. (Parenthetically, some arthropod parasites, Hypoderma bovis and H. lineata, the ox warbles, spend the greater part of their life cycle, ap- proximately 1 year, in intimate and in- ternal association with the host.) Types of Stimuli Stimuli affecting parasites may be divided into two types, external and internal stimuli. The former are not as well studied as the latter in the case of parasitic helminths, but for this refer to Wallace's excellent review (1961). External Stimuli. The microenviron- mental stimuli of the external environ- ment are chiefly those which are well recognized: oxygen, temperature, rela- tive humidity, pH, soil type, and vege- tation. The free-living stages of parasitic helminths require oxygen, although in small quantities, for development. This is supported in a negative way by ob- 126 BioScience Vol. 19 No. 2</page><page sequence="2">servations that development is inhibited at low oxygen tensions (Sprent, 1946; Shorb, 1944; Lucker, 1935; Silverman and Campbell, 1959; Stewart and Doug- las, 1939). It should be remembered that unless enclosed in an eggshell, the de- veloping larvae are living in an "aque- ous" environment so that the gases must be dissolved in the surface films of water. Also, there is very little dis- solved oxygen in such an environment. However, the utilization of oxygen even at low tensions has been well demon- strated by Rogers (1949). As will be mentioned later in the discussion of in vitro cultivation studies, there is a need for carbon dioxide as well. The larvae of such forms as hookworms and stomach worms of ruminants, al- though existing in films of water, live above ground and as such must have some contact with atmospheric oxygen. Most parasitic nematodes during their free-living stages may experience a rather broad range of temperature, but the optimal developmental temperatures are between 20 and 30 C (McCoy, 1930; Cordi and Otto, 1934; Furman, 1944; Mizelle and Berberian, 1953). Develop- ment cases between 10-15 C and tem- peratures of 50 ?- 5 C for short periods of time are lethal (McCue, unpub- lished observations). Although we have considered only development, it is likewise apparent that an increase in temperature causes another response in free-living stages of parasitic nematodes. They migrate toward areas of higher temperature (Parker and Haley, 1960). A complete assessment of this response is difficult because temperature can play an ap- preciable role in changing relative hu- midity as well, but as we have men- tioned, most free-living stages live in an environment which is "aquatic." How- ever, it is well demonstrated that in- fective stages of nematodes migrate vertically on vegetation and whether this is negative geotaxis, positive ther- motaxis, or both is difficult to assess. Knapp (1964) demonstrated that sur- vival of infective larvae of Haemonchus contortus (an abomasal parasite of sheep) varies depending on the type of forage on pastures. White clover and subterranean clover, which have heavier mats and more abundant foli- age than velvet grass, rye grass, and red clover, were much more suitable for persistence of the infective larvae. This may well be due to the mainte- nance of a higher relative humidity in the microenvironment. Various taxes have been shown by free-living stages of parasitic nematodes. We have mentioned the negative geo- taxis of strongylate nematode larvae. This is extremely obvious to anyone who, has made charcoal-feces cultures of such worms as Ancylostoma caninum and Nippostronglus brasiliensis. Most interesting is the fact that only the third-stage infective larvae exhibit this migration to the surface of the medium. First- and second-stage larvae persist in the medium where they feed vora- ciously. What stimulus is responsible for this marked difference is not clear. MacInnis (1965) demonstrated that free-swimming miracidia of Schistoso- ma mansoni displayed positive chemo- taxis. This taxis must be related to find- ing a suitable intermediate host. They were attracted by short chain fatty acids, some amino acids, and sialic acid. The substances which attracted mira- cidia were removed from snails by dis- tilled water, ethyl ether, acetone, and ethyl alcohol. Addition of butyric or glutamic acids to extracted snail tissues restored the chemotactic response. One aspect of the external environ- ment of parasites which is frequently neglected is the effect of man's activities on the parasite's environment. The ex- tensive increase of irrigation in Egypt has created additional new develop- mental areas for the snail intermediate host and additional aqueous environ- ments for the miracidial and cercarial stage of the blood flukes, Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium. This is an example of a direct action to benefit man which indirectly causes him in- creased harm. In this modern day, it is criminal to create situations which per- mit the increase of disease and particu- larly a parasitic disease caused by a worm which has two periods of hazard- ous existence in the external environ- ment. Research on proper control of the disease goes on, but to the present time, the infection seems to be winning the battle. Internal Stimuli. Stimuli to which parasitic helminths must react in the host may be due to factors which are humoral, cellular, nutritional, genetic, chemical and physiological, tempera- ture, directional cues, interactions with other species, and interactions with the same species. In addition, there are many other stimuli which are unknown but which cause marked response dif- ferences in the parasite. In general, it may be said that to date few of these many aspects have been adequately studied, but they are amenable to ex- perimentation. Complicating this situa- tion further, as we said before, is the fact that some helminths have two or three hosts each presenting a broad variety of stimuli to the worms. To illustrate this point and for those who are not parasitologists, let us follow the peregrinations of two hel- minth parasites during their life cycle. It will be apparent that the oppor- tunities for new and different environ- mental stimuli is magnificent. Nippo- strongylus brasiliensis is a parasite of the rat and dwells as an adult in the middle third of the small intestine. Mrs. Nip- postrongylus, after an early and (when one considers the lighting situation in the intestine) presumably furtive copu- lation, deposits eggs which already have begun cleavage in the lumen of the in- testine. This egg passes to the outside in the feces and is deposited on the ground. In a short time, the first stage larva hatches and proceeds to feed on bacteria and organic debris. It goes through two moults and as a third-stage larva is infective. It migrates to the surface of the substrate and awaits the unsuspecting host. (This process prob- ably goes on in or around the rat bur- row.) When a host contacts the larva, it begins immediately to penetrate the skin. The cue that sets off this pene- tration is poorly understood. When con- tact is made with the circulatory sys- tem, the venous system, the larva is car- ried to the liver and thence to the lung (this takes about 2 days). After a brief period in the lung capillaries, the larva breaks out into the alveolus and migrates up the respiratory tree to the larynx. It is swallowed and then passes down the esophagus, through the stomach, and ultimately to the small intestine where it completes its moults and becomes an adult. The male worm matures be- fore the female. Experimentally, this entire process takes about 14 days of which one-half are inside and one-half outside the host. The stimuli which cause these migrations and development must be complex. Another worm which has an even more complex cycle is Schistosoma February 1969 127</page><page sequence="3">mansoni, the blood fluke. In this cycle, Mrs. Schistosoma lives in the "ever- loving arms" of her spouse. The male worm has elongated folds of the body wall which enfold the female during copulation. When eggs are to be de- posited, the female migrates down the smaller vessels of the mesenteric veins and deposits eggs which may go one of two routes: (1) commence develop- ment and pass through the intestinal wall to the gut lumen, or (2) be pas- sively swept back to the liver by the mesenteric venous circulation. If the egg with its developed larva, a mira- cidium, passes to the gut lumen, it will pass out with the feces. If the feces con- taining eggs pass into water, the larva hatches and it swims about seeking an appropriate snail intermediate host. If one is contacted, the miracidium pene- trates the soft tissues of the snail. With- in the mollusc, the miracidium sheds its ciliated coat and becomes a mother sporocyst which produces, by an in- teresting form of multiplication, daugh- ter sporocysts which migrate to the area of the digestive gland. There, they pro- duce, within 4 weeks after infection, striking fork-tailed cercariae which leave the snail and swim about in the water. If a human performing its daily ablutions or Monday morning wash, or simply having a recreational dip is con- tacted, the cercaria penetrates the skin of the host, losing its tail in the process and will be delivered by the venous circulation to the liver. There, after about 7 weeks, the worms mature and then migrate down the mesenteric veins, against the flow of the circulation to live their adult life. Consider briefly the complexity of this cycle: the worms must adjust to an existence in the in- testinal mucosa, intestinal lumen, free in water, snail tissues, free in the water, the skin, liver, and blood vessels of man. Studies on the mechanism of the im- mune state in the host to helminth in- fections have demonstrated that one stimulus met by these parasites involves a humoral response which interferes with some of the enzymes required by that parasite to continue its existence in the host; thus, an enzyme-antienzyme sys- tem in which the enzymes served as antigens in previous infections and the antibodies produced to these enzymes are antienzymes (Thorson 1953; 1956; 1963). This type of stimulus essentially takes the food from the mouth of the helminth, and the nutritional status of the parasite will be seriously impaired. As helminth parasitic stages migrate through tissues, there is frequently a marked cellular response to the form. This response is greatly heightened in animals with previous exposure to the parasite. It is difficult to envision, in the usual case, that the cells very effectively hamper the migration of something as large as these helminths. However, in schistosome infections, as the eggs pass through the intestinal mucosa (and this is not an entirely passive process be- cause it appears that the miracidium se- cretes substances, presumably enzymatic in character, which assist in this mi- gration) in hosts with a long history of infection there is a remarkable cel- lular response, called a pseudotubercle, which can very effectively prevent pas- sage of the egg into the intestinal lumen. Here, the host response is a stimulus which physically stops the life cycle at that stage. These pseudotubercles, as can be imagined, are not in the best interests of the host. One of the more dramatic manifes- tations of host stimulus involves ge- netic control of the response of the host. MacDonald and Ramachandran (1965) have demonstrated that the susceptibil- ity of Aedes aegypti to various filarial parasites is controlled by a partially sex-linked recessive gene. This gene in monozygous recessive state permitted infection in 80% of mosquitoes tested. In the homozygous dominant condition, less than 2% of the mosquitoes were infected. Similar genetic stimuli control the suitability of mosquitoes which serve as malaria vectors. The actual mechanisms or stimuli responsible for these remarkable states are poorly studied but certainly warrant further investigation. Vertebrate hosts likewise display genetic control of susceptibility or re- sistance. Whitlock's study of "violet factor" in sheep (1958), which con- trols susceptibility to infection with trichostrongyle parasites, is another such instance. This factor appears to be a simple dominant whose allele in the homozygous recessive condition rep- resents susceptibility. The "resistant" expression seemed to be contained in the gastric mucosa. Liu (1966) tested several strains of mice for susceptibility to Nematospiroides, an intestinal trich- ostrongyle. Resistance varied from little to marked - C3H most suscept- ible, to Webster most resistant. Factors contributing to susceptibility seemed to be lowered tissue response to the para- site. The F1 progeny of a cross between the two strains revealed an ever higher resistance than that of the Webster parent strain (a suggestion that heterosis may be involved). The study of resistance and suscepti- bility to parasitic helminths may be a most profitable area. Going a bit afield, Person (1967) has suggested that in rust-grain parasitic relationships comple- mentarity or lack of complementarity of DNA may determine susceptibility or resistance. If this is so, some of the helminth-host systems might be most suitable for determination of such com- plementarity by attempts to form host- parasite hybrids from their nucleic acids. A number of chemical and physio- logical factors provide important stimuli for parasitic helminths. A detailed study of the in vitro cultivation attempts re- veals that for certain periods of the worm's development, high concentra- tions of CO2 are required (one study indicates concentration as high as 40% CO,/60% N2 (Meerovitch, 1965; Abel, 1965). The CO2 seems to give the cue for maturation, and it is interesting to speculate that CO2 fixation may be nec- essary for this action, or conversely that high CO2 concentrations change the pH of the medium. Exsheathment of infec- tive larvae of Haemonchus has been in- hibited by low concentrations of iodine. It was suggested by Rogers (1966) that carbon dioxide, serving as a trigger for exsheathment, was unable to react with the substance responsible because the iodine had interfered. To me, one of the most remarkable phenomena in parasitic helminths is the ability of the larval stages of Echinococ- cus granulosus found in herbivores (the adult is found in carnivores, dogs par- ticularly) to take one of two possible directions in development depending on the environmental stimuli. The larval protoscoleces from the hydatid cyst, if ingested by a dog, become, after 40 days, a perfectly respectable, albeit small, tapeworm. If, however, this pro- toscolex, which is simply the anterior end of the tapeworm, is freed within the intermediate host, it completely reorganizes and becomes another hy- 128 BioScience Vol. 19 No. 2</page><page sequence="4">datid cyst producing more protoscoleces. Smyth et al. (1966), working with in vitro systems, determined that the re- quirements of development into one or the other of these avenues rest on the evagination of the scolex which requires pepsin treatment, trypsin and bile salts, and further on, the presence of a suit- able nutritive substrate of particular physical constitution (in this case in the form of a byphasic medium). Notice the complexity and number of required stimuli. The scolex will then elongate, strobilate, and mature. Lacking these two series of stimuli, the protoscolex developed into a cystic form. This ability to control direction of development is one in which further study, particularly of the functional nucleic acid relation- ships, should be most revealing. Another organism with a remarkable life cycle is certainly reacting to en- vironmental stimuli but it is very poorly understood. Spirocerca lupi, a parasite as an adult in the esophagus of dogs, has an intermediate host, a dung beetle. When the infective larva in a beetle or paratenic chicken crop is ingested by a dog, the larva is freed and migrates in the wall of the gastric artery to the wall of the dorsal aorta and finally to a position in the aorta wall just anterior to the heart. It develops to near adult- hood there and then migrates from the wall of the aorta to the wall of the esophagus, opens an entrance to the lumen of the esophagus, and proceeds to mature and produce eggs. One is tempted to speculate that the worm is using blood pressure as a behavioral cue, but the move from the aorta to the esophagus which must be cued is at the present time completely mysti- fying. Responses of parasitic helminths to temperature are extremely interesting. McCue and Thorson (1964) observed that when parasitic helminths are placed in a thermal gradient, they mi- grate toward the higher temperatures. This is a direct and obvious positive thermotaxis. We anticipated that at the point in the gradient which approxi- mated the host's body temperature the worms would aggregate. We were wrong! The worms continued up the gradient until they were killed by ex- treme heat (60 C). Interestingly, the worms are able to survive higher tem- peratures in the gradient than if in- stantly exposed to higher temperatures. A brief exposure at 48 C will kill all the worms, whereas in the gradient they may remain viable at 55C for 10 minutes; this must be an example of acclimation which requires a shifting of gears in the enzymes controlling me- tabolism. Here is an example of a posi- tive response to a stimulus, but it is an open loop response, lacking the more normal homeostatic feedback loop. This response has been observed in species of cestodes, trematodes, nematodes, and acanthocephalans. Interestingly, free- living soil nematodes show a typical closed loop response; i.e., they select a temperature preferendum. Recent studies indicate that short wave-length ultraviolet (ca. 260 mn) irradiation prior to exposure to the gradient markedly interferes with the typical response. The evolutionary significance of the posi- tive thermotaxis is puzzling, but the loss of the feedback loop is an example of evolutionary parsimony. Why should the parasite expend energy on such a loop when the homeostatic mechanisms of the host will serve as well. Another area of ignorance which should be cited is the following: para- sitic helminths are found in practically every organ of the bodies of most hosts. The cues that guide these worms to such diverse sites as lymph nodes, kid- neys, liver, lungs, heart, striated mus- cle (and almost every organ of the body) are for all practical purposes poorly understood. Another stimulus experienced by par- asitic helminths is the presence of or- ganisms of the same or of different species. The ever present problem of dioecious species in which males must find females or vice versa is likewise of considerable interest. The forms which have a single fertilization (Tri- chinella, Nippostrongylus) apparently reverse the anthropomorphic trend; i.e., the females seek out the males. It would appear, although definition is not yet possible, that the males which are pro- tandrous secrete some pheromone which serves as an attraction to the females (Bonner and Etges, 1968). In species which have multiple fertilization (hook- worms, Ascaris), the female would appear to attract the males (Beaver and Little, 1964; Roche, 1966). Among other observations, those of Lie et al. (1967) on snails infected with trematodes indicate that if a snail has one species of trematode present, other species will not infect the snail. It has been observed generally that if adults of Ostertagia (a parasite of cat- tle) are present in the abomasal lumen, the fourth stage larvae buried in the mu- cosa do not migrate into the lumen until the adults have been removed (Michel, 1963). Thus, the same species may inhibit the further maturation of larval forms. What stimuli retard this development are not known. Several examples of indirect stimuli can be cited. McCue and Thorson (1965) observed that worms in a ther- mal gradient displayed a faster rate of migration at night (1 A.M.) than during the day. This could be ascribed to the activity pattern of the host rat. Re- versal of the day-night cycle of the host rat causes a similar reversal in the worms' migration rates. (Although this paper is not concerned with protozoan parasites, the epidemio- logical studies of Chernin [1952] on the relapse phenomenon of Leucocyto- zoan simondi in ducks, the effect of light on ovulation and relapse, the re- sultant production of susceptible duck- lings coincident with the outburst of blackflies, the arthropod intermediate, are so coincidental as to be amazing.) Davis and Read (1958) illustrated the fact that other hosts of the same species if put together into a situation which created stress, would not develop as good an immunity to trichinosis as those which were kept in an isolated state. It appeared that one aspect of the stressed animals might have con- tributed to this increased susceptibility. The weights of the adrenals of stressed animals were significantly greater. This is a remarkable indirect effect - the presence of others of the same host species affecting each other in such a way as to increase the susceptibility of the hosts to parasitic helminths. If a dog is immunized to hookworms by repeated infection with live worms, it has been demonstrated (Foster and Cort, 1932) that if that host is subse- quently placed on a protein and iron deficient diet, infection of the dog is again possible. Restoration of the proper levels of iron and protein will restore the immune state. As a final point, we should consider that turn-about is fair play. Parasitic helminths can provide some stimuli which will produce marked responses by the host. In mice or hamsters in- February 1969 129</page><page sequence="5">fected with plerocercoids of a pseu- dophyllidean tapeworm (Spirometra), there is a marked increase in weight. So much so, in fact, that the hosts get obese (Mueller, 1963). Several observations have been made on the effect of larval trematodes on snail hosts. Frequently, an infected snail will grow to a much larger size than the noninfected animal, illustrating gi- gantism. Also, there is a juvenilizing effect of the infection which may in some way be related to the production of some "juvenile" hormone (McClel- land and Bourns, in press). Arme (1968) has shown that plerocercoids of Ligula intestinalis cause a marked his- tological change in the pituitary and gonads of their fish hosts. He suggests that the parasite produces an anti- gonadotrophic substance. This discussion has not covered all the stimuli that affect parasitic hel- minths, but hopefully should indicate fertile areas for further research. I per- sonally hope that the breadth of our ignorance in this area has been reason- ably delineated. References Arme, C. 1968.
