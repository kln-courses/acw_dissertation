<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Citamparam Temple Complex and It8 Evolution by Paul Younger Art historians have been able to bring considerable order to the complex story of Hindu religious art. Historians of religion are, however, still inclined to look primarily to literary sources when reconstructing the religious history of India, and the potential contribution of art history is not properly utilized. A typical example of the problem is the scholarly neglect of the famous temple of Lord Natar?can, Dancing Sivan, in Citamparam. In spite of a number of books on aspects of its art, the history of the construction of the many dif? ferent parts of this temple complex has never been accurately traced. By tracing the history of the different parts of this temple complex, we should be able to determine such important events as changes in the deities and icons worshipped, changes in the direction the temple was understood to face, and changes in the social and political groups which utilized the temple. The overall story of these changes should give us a century by century account of what was going on in this temple, and a pretty good idea of the religious history of South India generally. The task of reconstructing the history of a large temple complex must be approached comprehensively, somewhat in the way a puzzle is put together. Each of the pieces of the puzzle must be examined systematically, with those which are easily dated and explained on the basis of inscriptions and style given their proper places first. Then, as the patterns become clearer, the more difficult pieces can be set into the sequence, and a clear evolution determined. In the case of Citamparam this task involves studying each of the large number of gateways, walls and shrines incorporated in the temple complex over the cen? turies. With additional help from the large number of inscriptions on the temple walls, and other evidences of the deep involvement of the temple in the social, political and religious movements of each age, it is eventually possible to sort out the puzzle and establish a reliable history. In the present study we will first (*) The transliteration of Indian words is in accord with the system of the Tamil Lexicon (Madras 1926), except where another spelling is so familiar that a change would be too confusing. [1] 205</page><page sequence="2">describe each of the parts of the temple complex, and then proceed to set forth the evolutionary sequence in which the temple complex developed. I. Description The Region Citamparam is on the east coast of southern India. Legends describe the whole area as a 'Tillai Forest', and the thick undergrowth of the Tillai shrub with its poison bark-milk still covers the five miles between Citamparam and the coast and makes it impassable except by taking the meandering backwater chan? nels. The legends describe this forbidding forest as the domain of the goddess K?li and her tiger (a matter to which we will return later), and give the reason for the location of the Citamparam temple as the desire of some ascetics to see if they could survive in an environment so alien to human habitation. The area to the south and west of Citamparam changed dramatically when irrigation was introduced into this region. The unreliable Vell?r River provides some water for irrigation and enters the sea only a few miles north of Citam? param, but most of the water for irrigation was brought to the area by the northernmost branch of the Kaveri River delta. This branch, which was probably artificially created, is now called the Kollitam or Coleroon and enters the sea about five miles south of Citamparam. This area to the south and west is a densely populated agricultural region with important temples and monasteries scattered throughout. In the political system of segmented states or n?tus which emerged in this area in the early centuries of the Christian era, Citamparam was given a special place as a taniy?r (ARE 1888: no. 118) or independent territory reporting directly to the central administration of the empire. The reasons for this arrangement are not known for certain, but three special circumstances may have contributed to it. One is the fact that the temple complex may have been established earlier and could not easily be brought under the authority of one of the n?tus when they were later set up by the landlords who controlled the irrigation channels. A second possible explanation is the fact that the town seems to have had trade connections with nearby Sri Lanka which would make it relatively independent. And the third is that at times the town seems to have been used by the mys? terious Kalapira rebels as their 'capital'. The town now has a population of 48,800 and stretches for about three blocks around the temple complex on all sides before the fields of rice begin. Hymns repeatedly describe the 'multistoried' glorious houses of Citamparam, but the architecture of the town today is rather similar to that in other towns of the region. 206 [2]</page><page sequence="3">The Outer Walls and Gateways As with most South Indian temples, the temple complex of Citamparam is defined in terms of a series of concentric rectangular walls arranged along the north/south and east/west axes and punctuated by elaborate gateway towers or k?purams. In the case of Citamparam there are four concentric walls {or five if one counts the wall of the inner shrine itself as some do), and there are four gateway towers facing in the four cardinal directions along the third of the walls (counting from the inner to the outer). The outermost or fourth wall was built during the late Vicayanakara period (fourteenth to seventeenth centuries) and is an 'after thought' to the overall plan of the temple complex. The wall cannot be seen from the outside where it crowds against the priestly houses of the first surrounding street, and the compound between the third and fourth walls has been turned into a grove of coconut and mango trees. The third wall, which is punctuated on each of its four sides with a gateway tower, has clearly been the major outer wall of the temple since the renovation of the temple in the twelfth century. On the inside of the southern section of this third wall, and part way up the eastern and western walls from the south, is an exquisite two storeyed set of porches built in the twelfth century. These porches provide important clues as to the sequence in which the gateway towers were completed and the numerous shrines in the vast third compound were set in place. The four gateway towers, whose art has been studied in detail by J.C Harle (1963), are important records in the history of Saiva temple religion in South India. There are two important questions for religious history in the evidence of the gateway towers. One is the question of how there came to be towers on each of the four sides of the third wall, and in particular in what sequence were they built and by whom? The second question has to do with the ideas expressed in the stone sculpture on the bases of the towers and on the inside of the gateways. A number of guesses have been made about the sequence in which the four towers were built, but the evidences of art history, epigraphy and ritual require? ment do not fit together neatly and the puzzle continues to trouble historians. The evidence of art history is reasonably clear in that the art of the well worn reddish stone of the west k?puram seems to be the oldest; that of the south and east kopurams seems to be a bit uneven, pointing to some renovation, but is generally later than that of the west tower; and that of the north k?puram is clearly the latest. The sculpture on the base of all four has been declared to be 'late Cola' in style (Balasubrahmanyan 1943, 1944, 1979; Somasundaram 1963; Natarajan 1974) so they were all presumably built between 1070 when Kul?t tunka I came to power and the fifteenth century after which the 'Vicayanakara' style became common in South Indian temple gateways. [3] 207</page><page sequence="4">The evidence of epigraphy does not, however, neatly confirm the expectations of art history. A puzzling negative evidence of epigraphy is that there are no C?la king's inscriptions on any of the gateways. There are thirteenth century inscriptions of P?ntya and Pallava kings on the west, south and east k?purams, and fifteenth century inscriptions of Vicayanakara kings on the north k?puram. One might be initially inclined to think on the basis of this evidence that the west, south and east k?purams were built only in the thirteenth century, but there are three arguments against such a conclusion. One is that the art seems to be earlier; a second that a twelfth century C?la inscription on a wall mentions building two towers (we will return to this inscription); and the third that the C?la kings of the late thirteenth century still refrained from putting inscriptions on the gateways even after the P?ntya and Pallava kings had done so. The only convincing explanation is that the Colas, who had rather strict regulations about inscribing and whose inscriptions were carefully placed and deeply inscribed, had traditions which did not allow for the placing of inscriptions on these gate? ways even after they were built. The case of the northern k?puram is different in that if it had been built one cannot imagine reasons why the P?ntya and Pallava kings would not have placed their inscriptions on it as they did on the other gateways. It seems safe to conclude from the evidence of inscriptions on the towers that the west, south and east towers were built before the thirteenth century, and that the northern tower was built sometime after the thirteenth century but before the 'Vicayanakara' style had taken full hold on the art tradition. The positive 'claims' for gateway construction found in the inscriptions also need some examination. The earliest claim was made in the long twelfth century inscription on renovations by Kul?ttunka I's general, Naralokaviran (ARE 1888: no. 120.12; Sil: IV 225; SITI: 127.2,3; Balasubrahmanyan 1979: 23-26; Swamy 1979: 123-134). He says he built two gateway towers. The same inscription takes for granted that the southern entrance is the long established one used for festival processions, an arrangement the antiquity of which is also evident in the fact that the deity faces south and the flagstaff and offering seat or pitam are placed to his south. The inscription does not claim that he built the southern tower. Presumably the two 'new' towers referred to would be those on the west and east which were probably originally in line with one another and in line with the sides of the flagstaff which stands in front of the deity. The thir? teenth century 'claims' to construct the southern gateway tower made by K?p peruncinka Pallava (ARE 1921: no. 285; Sil: XII 119; ARE 1902: no. 463; Sil: VIII 51) and Cuntara P?ntya C) may be taken as the claims of two bitter (*) Suntara P?ntya, after defeating K?pperuncinka, made his 'claim* by putting his family crest, the 'fish*, on the lintel stone above the doorway. 208 [4]</page><page sequence="5">military rivals to each take credit for a major renovation of the original and ancient gateway which was underway during their sporadic visits to the temple. This renovation would account for the fact that the artwork of the southern k?puram appears to be newer than that of the western k?puram, even though the southern k?puram was certainly the earliest one in the temple's evolution. Another 'claim' by K?pperuncinka (ARE 1905: no. 198) that he built the eastern k?puram must also be taken to refer to a renovation programme, but in this case a complicated question of relocating the eastern gateway is involved which will be discussed shortly in another context. The last 'claims' to gateway construc? tion are those of the Vicayanakara kings Kirucanatevar?ya and Acyutatevar?ya found on the northern k?puram (ARE 1881: nos. 174-75; ARE 1913: nos. 371, 374). These claims presumably only involved finishing the upper tower of a base which had earlier been completed in the 'Cola' style. It is important to note at this point that the canons of temple construction found in medieval Sanskrit texts prescribe the eastern entrance as the proper entrance for a temple. Almost all temples built for the first time in stone conform to that canon. Famous temples such as Srlrankam, Tiruv?naikk? and Citampa? ram, however, seem to have had well established earlier traditions with the temple oriented in another direction. While in each case efforts were made to rearrange the temple to bring it in line with the prescribed canon, in those temples the earlier traditions continued to survive. In the case of Citamparam the first modification of the 'southern' orientation of the temple took place with the building of the west and east k?purams in the twelfth century. Prior to this time most temples had only single k?purams and even where they had two, as in the famous royal temple at Tanc?v?r of the eleventh century, the two k?purams were in line with one another on an inner and an outer wall. The twelfth century renovations at Citamparam put k?purams on the west, where the bulk of the population lived and the neighbour? ing Anantlcuvaran and Pullcuvaran temples were located ?(")&gt; and on the east, where the legendary 'Three Thousand' priests of the temple lived (3). These new towers thus provided important population groups of Citamparam with their (2) These neighbouring temples seem to be rather old for they were given some stones with fragmentary inscriptions on them during the great twelfth century renovation of the Citamparam temple (see Balasubrahmanyan 1943). Their legendary histories are linked with those of Citamparam in the thirteenth century Koil Pur?na (Cidambaram?b?tmy?) which has the tiger-man PulTcavara (Sanskrit: Vy?ghrap?da) and Ananticavara (Sanskrit: Pat?njali) both wait in the western area for the dance of Sivan to begin. Whether the temple traditions or the unity legend came first would be hard to say. (3) The legends about this special priestly community, known as the 'Three Thousand* in acient texts, are numerous. Called the Potu Titcitars today they still are a strict en dogamous community with many customs and priestly practices unique to this temple. [5] 209</page><page sequence="6">own entrances. In addition, the southern entrance, which by that time would have been considered inauspicious by many Hindus because of the association of the south with death, was no longer the only entrance to the temple. Thus this first reorientation of the temple away from its original, southern, entrance served three purposes: it met the requirement of orthodox canons of temple construc? tion, it met the needs of special social groups, and it responded to the growing superstition about the south as the direction of death. The aesthetic effect was positive and gave the overall temple complex an enclosed look which was to be imitated often in later temples. A later thirteenth century renovation sought to bring the temple more into line with orthodox canons with regard both to facing east and with making the central shrine a lihka rather than an anthropomorphic image. The opening sec? tion of the widely respected Siva Pur?na had expressed the preference of the or? thodox for lihka worship, and only in a few temples, such as Citamparam where the 'Dancing Image' of the deity was so clearly identified with the place, was there resistance to the new canon. Even in Citamparam a compromise had to be worked out and in the thirteenth century a lihka temple was set up in the second courtyard facing east. There is no inscriptional evidence as to who the builder was, but the style is similar to the thirteenth century temple to Kali built outside of the town to the north by the Pallava ruler K?pperuncirika (ARE 1903: no. 401). He also made a number of donations to the Takacinam?rti shrine on the outer wall of the lihka temple, and in the inscriptions about these donations he refers to the lihka as the 'M?lan?tan' or 'Central Deity' of the temple (ARE 1913: nos. 305, 307). To return to the question of the remodeling of the eastern kopuram, we find the following unusual evidences: the twelfth century 'porches' of the third wall end abruptly for no obvious reason at a point one third of the way along the eastern wall in line with the western kopuram, and the wall itself at that point has been rebuilt; the eastern kopuram is now in line with the lihka temple, and is treated in the orthodox way as the major entrance to the temple complex through which the image of the deity is carried, and K?pperuncinka, who claims to have 'built' the eastern kopuram and made dedications to the lihka temple, never mentions the Dancing Image in any of the sixty-five inscriptions he left in the temple. It seems evident that in the thirteenth century remodeling of the eastern kopuram it was rebuilt about a hundred meters further north where it was no longer in line with the western kopuram and the flagstaff of the Dancing Image, but was in line with the lihka temple entrance. This dramatic change in the orientation of the temple finally made the eastern entrance the major one in accord with orthodox canons. The second major question with regard to the gateways has to do with the sculpture which appears on their walls. There are three groups of sculpture 210 [6]</page><page sequence="7">on each of the four towers. A lower tier is made up of fortysix figures on each tower with a reasonable variation in selection from tower to tower; an upper tier is made up of twentysix larger panels of the different iconographic forms of Sivan with the sequence of panels in each tower the same except for substi? tutions to bring the sequence into conformity with overriding iconographic con? siderations; and, in a feature unique to this temple, the inner walls of the walkways themselves contain square panels of the sixtyfour traditional dance poses. The lower tier may well have been the original effort at creating a selec? tion of religious sculpture to assist the devotion of the worshipper. While some of these panels are now damaged from centuries of handling by the public, many are still such objects of popular devotion that facilities for priestly services have been made available in front of some panels. The most prominent panel figures on this level are the goddesses and in particular the multiarmed Patirak?lis and buffalo-slaying Turkas. Gods of the relevant directions and numerous sages are also portrayed, (it may be significant that the sages, Viy?kkirapata and Patancali, who the legend-book of the thirteenth century credit with founding the temple, do not appear in the twelfth century west k?puram panels but do on the thir? teenth century south and east k?purams). The panels which have received the most sustained worship are those depicting Pillaiy?r (Kanecan or Vin?yakan) and Murukan (Cupiramaniyan, Kantan). In the case of the west k?puram the Karpaka Vin?yakan on the outside and the Murukan on the inside have both developed into separate shrines with priestly staffs. The upper tier of panels of the different forms of Sivan provide a gallery of Saiva iconographic art with many examples being considered masterpieces of their kind. These panels are well above the worshipper's reach and are not themselves objects of worship. The sequence of presentation is fixed except for the necessary substitutions which are required by a change in direction on the different towers (4). This sequence becomes standard in Saiva gateway towers (4) Harle has provided a thorough stu&lt; does not account for the changes from one as follows: Outside (left to right) 1. Gaj?sura 2.

Perhaps the remodeling of Citamparam during the reign of Kul?ttuhka I was the occasion in which the growing number of anthropomorphic images of Sivan were brought together within a single eclectic vision. In this galaxy of Saiva forms neither the Dancer Natar?can, nor the lihka form, are to be found, a fact which placed them in a different category as forms suitable for full ritual worship. The third grouping of sculpture was the arrangement of square panels along the inside of the doorways illustrating the traditional dance poses (Sivaramamurti 1974). This architectural motif had already been used in a different setting and Left End (to those approaching Right End from outside) 1. Candes?nugraha 1. Ordhva T?ndava 2. Vm?dhara Daksin?murti 2.

Each of the following changes constitutes a revealing example of an overriding religious concern which made it necessary for this carefully arranged sequence to be changed as one moved from k?puram to k?puram. In some cases the reasoning is not abundantly clear, but in most cases it is. On the western k?puram the locations of Kevala Candrasekhara and Lingodbhava are switched. This switch made it possible for Lingodbhava to be facing west on both the eastern and western k?purams and thus to be in the standard position it took on the small early C?la temples. On the southern k?puram the locations of Som?skandha and Kahk?la are switched. This switch eliminated the inauspicious situation which would have arisen when a worshipper leaving the temple by the southern entrance, which is the direction ruled by Yama the God of death, would have seen the skull and bones of the Kahk?la. On the northern k?puram the location of Bhiks?tana and Kaly?nasundara are switched. This switch made it possible for the Bhiks?tana, which is the grandest sculpture in the whole temple complex, to be placed in front of a large open area and especially wor? shipped during the next-to-last day of the ?ni and M?rkali festivals. On the western k?puram the Ardhan?ri is switched with the Haryardha, This switch makes it possible to keep the half figure of Visnu on the west of both the eastern and western k?purams, thus facing in a direction usually associated with Visnu. On the western k?puram the Kankal? is switched with the Kaly?n so as to avoid the inauspicious situation which would arise if a worshipper looking south were to see the skull and bones of Kahk?la. On the western k?puram the Vin?dhara Daksin?murti, which should always face south, was switched with the ?rdhva T?ndava, and was also moved to the more prominent central niche on the southern end. 212 [8]</page><page sequence="9">with a different religious import in Tanc?v?r, the great royal temple of Ir?ca r?ca I. There the dance panels .were arranged around the base of the shrine and the dancer was male and apparently Si van himself. In the doorway panels of Citamparam the dancer is female and the labels clearly identify the traditional poses potrayed. The result is that while the dance panels provide an aesthet? ically rich preparation for the worshipper proceeding in to worship the Dancing Sivan, the dance panels themselves are clearly not iconographic representations of the divine. The Structures of the Third 'Courtyard The open third courtyard of the Citamparam temple is a large area 'pro? tected' from the world outside by the four gateway towers and yet not so over? whelmingly sacred as the first and second pirak?ras or corridor/courtyards. It is to the third courtyard area that the image of the deity is brought for much of the festival activity and it is there that worshippers daily carry out a sequence of preparatory steps as they go in to worship. The central feature of the third courtyard is the great Sivak?hk? tank which centers the northern half of the courtyard and provides a balance to the sacred area in the center of the southern half of the courtyard. This water tank has elegant porches all around which were part of the twelfth century remodeling. Facing east toward the water tank is the major temple of the goddess Siva k?macuntarl which was part of the twelfth century remodeling and fits in nicely with the porches of the tank. There is, however, an ancient shrine of Turk? which is crowded between the goddess temple and the tank and was probably considered too sacred to be moved when they were built. Also crowded against the south wall of the goddess temple is a pre-twelfth century structure which has obviously been remodeled a number of times and is now in disrepair. It was called the Hundred-Pillared-Hall in the twelfth century remodeling and was de? scribed at that time as a place for Sivan and K?li to dance. On the eastern side of the tank is the great Thousand-Pillar ed-Hall or Ir? ca Sap? where festival rituals are now held twice a year. This great building is surprisingly never accounted for in inscriptions, but in terms of style and other references would seem to have been built in the mid-twelfth century as a royal palace. The builder was probably Kul?ttunka II who is reputed to have spent much of his reign in Citamparam, but who, for perhaps reasons of respect or superstition, never allowed any inscriptions to be carved on the temple walls during his reign. Kul?ttunka IPs court poet describes how he 'Threw a Visnu image into the sea' at Citamparam, and one might surmise that the Visnu temple Vaisnava poets had earlier sung about was removed from this location when the [9] 213</page><page sequence="10">Ir?ca Sap? was built. In any case that is the way the Vaisnavas understood the story and they appealed to the Vicayanakara rulers for a restoration. A Vaisnava shrine was eventually set up by Acyutatevar?ya in the inner courtyard in 1539. It seems reasonable to assume that the renowned water tank of the third courtyard once had a goddess temple to its west, and a Visnu temple to its east, in addition to the temple of Dancing Sivan to the south. The renovations under Kul?ttuhka I started to change that arrangement by building the temple of a goddess more closely associated with Natar?can on the west, and the subsequent construction of the royal palace by Kul?ttunka II on the site of the Visnu temple changed it further. These changes not only altered the atmosphere by making Dancing Sivan the central focus of worship, but also brought the political domain directly into the life of the temple complex in a new way. The remaining shrines of the third courtyard appear to have been later constructions which did not involve the complex alterations of religious loyalty that the building programmes to the west and east of the water tank entailed. The Murukan temple in the northwest corner was built by the P?ntya kings for their favourite deity when they controlled the area in the late thirteenth century. The 'Cola style' buildings, housing Vin?yakan and the Planets in the Southwest corner and Northcentral areas respectively, appear to be later structures even though built in the 'Cola' style. The bull or Nanti of the southern courtyard is old and is a reminder that the second wall, which now blocks a direct southern entrance to the inner sanctum, is a late addition. The Structures of the Second Corridor/Courtyard The second wall at Citamparam encloses an area in the middle of the southern half of the vast third courtyard. The area enclosed is less than a quarter of the total area of the temple complex. The doorways are on the eastern and western sides and are ornate, but they have no towers or k?purams. The second corridor has been covered over in recent centuries and 'late-Vicayanakara' pil? lars and corbels have been added so that the effect is crowded and congested in contrast to the openness of the third courtyard. The appearance of the area inside the second wall is that of a corridor about twenty feet wide with structures off to either side and large rooms in the four corners for cooking or preparing festival carts. This appearance is actually a bit misleading for the 'first' wall around the sacred inner area defines a square set well to the west within the second square. The result is that on the western side the second court is really a corridor, while on the other three sides import? ant structures are found beside the corridor. The important structure of the northern side is the lihka temple of the 214 [10]</page><page sequence="11">thirteenth century which has already been mentioned. As has already been pointed out, this temple faces east and was probably built by Kopperuncinka the Pallava king who also probably set the east k?puram in line with it. Both the nine? teenth century corridor along the side of this temple and the second wall, which must have been built sometime after the time of Kopperuncinka, now obscure the natural entrance to the lihka temple from the east, but the intention of Kop? peruncinka in terms of the orthodoxy of the thirteenth century can still be discerned. ' The structures of the eastern and southern sides respectively are older and have wood-framed shingled roofs like the inner sanctum itself. They, with their copper-shingled roofs, and the inner sanctum, with its gold-shingled roof, ap? pear to be the three main structures which stood on this site before the early twelfth century renovation of Naralokaviran which introduced the network of walls and other buildings which eventually become the temple complex as we know it. The ancient structure in the eastern section of the second courtyard is now called the Teva Sap?, but was referred to in all old inscriptions as the Per-Am palam or 'Great Hall', in obvious contrast to the name Cirr-Ampalam or 'Little Hall' by which the inner sanctum was then known. The function of the Per-Am palam is not clearly spelled out in early inscriptions, but it is mentioned in con? nection with two matters: royal visits and the singing of the hymns of the Saiva saints or n?yanm?rs (ARE 1888: no. 120.13, 14; ARE 1928-9: nos, 315, 349; ARE 1901: 215). These two matters were more closely associated than one might expect at first. The three itinerant hymn-singing saints ? Appar, Campan tar and Cuntarar ? were commoners who lived in the seventh and eighth cen? turies. The collecting of their hymns and their use in a widespread system of devotion was, however, closely associated with the consolidation of C?la power in the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries. The story of how the C?la king ordered Nampi ?ntar Nampi to get the hymns from the Citamparam temple, where they had been locked up by the priests, is well known, and clearly symbolizes the situation in the early C?la years when the C?la kings enthusiastically supported the hymn-singing cultus while the priests showed their reluctance for it. The socio-political significance of C?la support of the hymn-singing cultus need be traced here only in a general way. The basic social fabric of the Kaveri River valley region which the C?las governed was determined by the n?tus which were governed by the Vel?la landlord who controlled the irrigation channels of a given region. These Vel?las built temples in their regions, usually in the name of a local goddess or a god somehow tied to their family lineage. When the hymn-singers visited these local temples they did a lot to bring them into a larger Saiva tradition. When the C?la kings later sponsored this hymn-singing [ii] 215</page><page sequence="12">tradition, the loyalty of the Vel?las both to the hymn-singing tradition and to the Cola hegemony was strengthened. The Per-Ampalam seems to have served as a ritual base of this combined royal/hymn-singing cult in the period of Cola ex? pansion between the ninth and the twelfth centuries. In the southern corridor is an even more mysterious structure with two adjoining wood-framed, copper-shingled, roofs. The structure in this case is now called the Nrtta Sap? or Dancing Hall, but was called Etir-Ampalam or 'Opposite Hall' in ancient inscriptions, clearly again a name relating the structure to the central shrine which was 'opposite' or 'in front of the Etir-Ampalam (5). The Etir-Ampalam is actually two adjoining structures with two roofs. The smaller of the two faces east and houses a small image of K?li in her pose as an offended dancer who was defeated by Sivan in a dance contest when he lifted his leg straight over his head and she had to withdraw out of modesty (Shulman 1980: 215-21). The second structure is a high platform or open dance hall with highly ornate pillars, presumably the site of the K?li/Sivan dance. This dance hall is directly south of the central shrine and provides a natural view of Dancing Sivan in the central shrine. It is difficult to know when the structure was built, but it appears to have been early and could conceivably have been a traditional holy place of K?li in relation to which the central shrine was itself established. When Kul?ttunka I received a sacred stone from the king of Cam? bodia in the twelfth century, he inserted it in the already respected Etir-Ampa? lam where it could be seen by the Dancing Image (ARE 1888: II 119). The Central Courtyard When the first wall with its lovely porches was built by Naralokoviran in the twelfth century it surrounded only the central shrine or Cirr-Ampalam and the sacred well, and had a single door to the south. Since then the courtyard has been crowded with other structures. Some of these are an easily recognized (5) An odd scholarly confusion was touched off in 1913-14 when an editor summar? izing the findings from Gtamparam in the Annual Report on Epigraphy made the offhand comment that the 'Etir Ampalam' or 'opposite hall' mentioned in inscription number 290 of that year might refer to the lihka temple which was 'opposite' the inscription itself ? thus making the preposterous suggestion that this renowned name which had occurred in earlier inscriptions might have been given by the scribe himself. Scholars for some time followed this misleading identification (or made even wilder guesses), but have now re? turned to the argument of Kielhorn who had earlier identified the Etir-Ampalam with the Nrtta Sap? based on the clear account of its position in no. 119 of the Annual Report on Epigraphy of 1888. His argument had appeared both in Indian Antiquary, XXIV, p. 298 and in Epigraphia Indica, IV 70 and V 105. 216 [12]</page><page sequence="13">nineteenth century canopy in the eastern area and a pillared walkway along the back of the central shrine. The major addition to the courtyard is the Visnu temple built in the south? west corner in the sixteenth century. This temple was built by the Vicayanakara ruler Acyuta in 1539 in response to protests by Vaisnava leaders that their earlier worship centre in Citamparam had been destroyed. The existence of such an earlier Vaisnava worship place was known only on the basis of somewhat ambiguous literary references. First of all there were references in hymns of the traveling ?ly?rs or Vaisnava saints, Tirum?rikai and Kulacekhara, of the eighth century to worshipping Visnu in the Tirucitrakutancenru or 'sacred little halP where he was served by the 'Three Thousand' or the regular priests of Citampa? ram. Second there were references in poems of the court poet Ottakuttan at the time of Kul?ttunka II in the twelfth century to 'throwing the image of Visnu into the sea where he belonged'. After the Vicayanakara rulers took power in the late fourteenth century and were generally supportive of Vaisnavism, the Vai? snava leaders took up the cause of the Visnu image of Citamparam and three or four 'restorations' of the image were said to have been arranged. Presumably the issue still rankled until Acyuta built the Kovintar?can temple of Visnu right in the inner courtyard in 1539 (ARE 1913: II 272; ARE 1915: 11*1). The subsequent work on the pillared hallway to the Kovintar?can shrine, and the opening of the wall and erection of a flagstaff, pillar and small k?puram for that temple are said to have so upset the Citamparam priests that some jumped to their death from the tower in protest (Heras 1927). The central shrine of Citamparam is still a stunningly unique building in spite of all the walls and other structures which have been built around it (6). The Cirr-Atnpalatn or 'Little Hall' as it was called in early inscriptions, or the Cit Sap? or 'Consciousness Hall' as it is called today, is clearly set apart from everything around by its style and the special care with which it is treated. Set on a high stone platform four feet above the surrounding area, the Little Hall is twentyfour feet east to west and twelve feet north to south and has a high (?) The style of the Cirr-Ampalam seems to have been the style of wooden temples built before brick and stone temples became common. Representatives of this style are found carved on the walls at Amaravati and a stone imitation is to be seen in the 'Traupati* temple of Mah?balipuram. Whether this rectangular style has any connection with the descriptions of a lnakard* style usually thought to be north Indian, as F.H. Gravely and T.N. Ramachandran suggest in The Three Main Styles of Temple Architecture Recognized by the Silpa Sastras, Bulletin of the Madras Government Museum, Vol. III 1, 1934 (re? printed 1977), is a complex matter beyond the concern of the present study. The legend? ary ties of the priesthood with north India, especially Bengal, would make it quite possible to view this unusual little shrine as preserving a lost religious heritage from almost any part of the Indian sub-continent.

The Dancing Image or Sivan Natar?can is seen through that doorway which is entered up five steps from the already high porch. To the west of the doorway is a latticework screen through which worshippers now look for a 'Rahacayam' or 'Secret* presence of the deity who is beyond form, a form of worship which is not referred to in early inscriptions or texts, and was presumably developed after Sankara's Ved?ntic teachings became more widespread in the fifteenth century. The Cirr-Ampalam covers only half of the platform on which it sits. The front porch area of the platform, where much of the worship activity takes place, was given a roof of copper shingles in the thirteenth century and now has folding-door walls. It is now usually called the Kanaka Sap? (7). The overall effect crowds the Cirr-Ampalam and gives the impression of twin gold-shingled roofs. Most worshippers are, however, well aware of the difference between the two structures and pay the sacred gold-shingled Cirr-Ampalam respect bordering on worship. II. The Pattern of Evolution Stage One There are two different traditions about the origins of worship in Citampa ram. One tradition is found in the thirteenth century legend book which de? scribes how sages Viy?kkirapata and Patancali worshipped a lihka near the water tank as they awaited the earthly dance of Sivan. These legends reflect thirteenth century religious concerns with reconciling the lihka cult and the Danc? ing Sivan cult, and with accommodating North Indian pilgrims. These stories were not represented in early parts of the temple or even in the extensive sculp? tural portrayals of the twelfth century. Another tradition speaks of K?li as the protectress of the forest in this area and of Sivan's gaining control by defeating her in a dance contest. The antiquity of this legend is difficult to trace, but early architecture of the temple reflects this tradition even though it was obviously being suppressed during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The two earliest architectural features of the temple appear to be the two high platforms face to face with one another at a distance of about a hundred yards where Kali and Dancing Sivan respectively are said to reside. Both are covered by very early (?) This name which literally means 'Golden HalF was earlier an alternate name for the Cit Sap?. Apparently when the *Cit Sap?' name became established the extra name started to be used more in reference to the porch area. 218 [14]</page><page sequence="15">wood-frame thatch-style roofs, but that covering Kali's dance hall is in copper while that covering Dancing Sivan was overlaid with gold shingles in the ninth century by the first great C?la conquerors ?titya I and Parantaka I. (Anbil Cop? per Plates; Layer Leiden Plates; Tiruvalankadu Copper Plates) Later canons of temple style never allowed for a platform blocking the entranceway to the deity in the way the Nrtta Sap? or Dance Hall now does, thus providing further evi? dence that this arrangement of the two halls was very early and of central importance to the religious understanding of the whole complex. We may safely say that the earliest stage in the evolution of the temple complex probably in? volved an amalgamation of goddess worship and Sivan worship. Sivan Natar?can faced south, the direction of death, and danced on the cremation ground control? led by the goddess K?li. The other feature of the early life of Citamparam was the role played by its special priesthood called the 'Three Thousand'. In eighth century visits by both Saiva and Vaisnava saints their presence is the feature of the temple most frequently referred to. By this time most other temples were being built by the Vel?la chiefs of the n?tus or regions and were well integrated into the local society. The situation in Citamparam, however, seems to have been that it was a kind of ?cir?ma or meditation centre primarily for the 'Three Thousand' and their families, a group which very likely migrated from North India and jealously preserved its special worship traditions. l. 2. STAGE ONE 3. 1. Water Tank. 2. Cit Sap? (Cirrampalam). 3. Nrtta Sap? (Etirampalam). [15] 219</page><page sequence="16">Stage Two A second stage in the evolution of the Citamparam worship centre came about when the C?la kings rose to power in the ninth century. They covered the hall of Dancing Sivan in gold and built the Per-Ampalam as their headquarters beside the deity and as a place from which the collected hymns of the saints could be sung. The C?la kings seemed to feel that the priests' esoteric views should not be allowed to rule the sacred place unchallenged, and they introduced to Citamparam the hymn-singing cult which they were using to unify their empire. The greatest of the C?las, Ir?car?ca I, modified this policy to the extent that he built his own royal temple in Tanc?v?r in the eleventh century, but he continued the tradition to the extent that he sponsored both the hymn-singing cult and the Dancing Sivan cult in his new temple. He even went so far in attempting to transfer the Citamparam spirit to Tanc?v?r that he built a special shrine for Dancing Sivan and had a replica of the Cirr-Ampalam shrine itself carved into the wall of his new temple. STAGE TWO 5. 4. Deva Sap? (Perampalam). 3. Earlier South K?puram and Third Wall. 220 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Stage Three A third stage in the evolution of Citamparam developed when in the twelfth century Kul?ttuhka I abandoned the idea of royal temples which Ir? car?ca I and Ir?centira I, his son, had attempted, and had his general, Naralo kaviran, construct a major temple complex in stone at Citamparam. Up to this time Citamparam had been a rather quaint worship centre of three thatch-style wooden halls preserving an earlier style three hundred years after stone architec? ture had been introduced in the area. Naralokaviran put up the first and third walls, the western and eastern k?purams, the water tank steps and porches and the goddess temple of the third courtyard. His religious concerns do not seem to have been very revolutionary except for his efforts to reform goddess worship. In providing a major facility for the worship of Sivak?macuntari, the consort goddess of Sivan Natar?can, he put a final end to the earlier theme of compe? tition with the ferocious Kali and introduced goddess worship in a new, more domesticated, form. The political impact of his extensive remodeling indicates that the Cola kings had come to rest their own ritual hegemony solidly in the Saiva camp and in Citamparam as its centre. This became even more evident a half century later when Kul?ttunka II removed an old Visnu shrine from the i. 10. 12 a,. D 8. p STAGE THREE 6. Tird Wall Porches. 7. West K?puram. 8.

That ultimate show of partisan C?la support of Saivism was long resented by the Vaisnavas and later rectified by the Vicayanakara kings. Stage Four A fourth stage in the evolution of Citamparam emerged in the thirteenth century as the hold of the C?la court weakened and the forces of orthodox Saiva priestly tradition grew stronger. The physical changes in Citamparam at this time were not major, but they were sufficiently important to respond to the new religious spirit. The erection of the lihka temple by the Pallava king K?pperuncinka, and the subsequent resituating of the eastern k?puram in line with it were important innovations which allowed the temple to compromise with the priestly orthodoxy of the day. An attempt to reconcile this innovation with the longstanding focus on Dancing Sivan at Citamparam is evident in the official legends of Viy?kkirapata and Patancali, written up in the thirteenth cen? tury, which attempt to show that the two cults are harmonious. Another attempt at reconciliation was the erection of the second wall of the temple which restored somewhat the centrality of the shrine of the Dancing 222 STAGE FOUR 13. Linka Temple. 14.

Stage Five A fifth stage in the evolution of Citamparam emerged in the Vicayanakara period from the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries. In contrast with other large temple complexes of the region there was little building activity in Citam? param during this period. The noted exception was the insertion of the Kovin tar?can shrine for Visnu right in the first courtyard just in front of Dancing Sivan in 1539. This was done on the explicit orders of the Vicayanakara ruler, Acyuta, and was no doubt a Vaisnava ruler's reaction to the argument that the Cola kings had been partisan in closing down an earlier Visnu shrine in the temple compound. During the Vicayanakara period a new institutional base of Saivism devel? oped in the matas or monasteries of the Ved?nta and Saiva Siddh?nta theologi? cal schools. Citamparam as a leading Saiva temple could not help but be linked STAGE FIVE 17. Kovintar?can Temple. 18. North K?puram Tower. 19. Fourth Wall. [19] 223</page><page sequence="20">in some ways with these theological movements, but the links appear to have been more distant than one might have expected. The Saiva Siddh?nta matas, which are only about forty miles from Citamparam, reorgani2ed the hymn-sing? ing tradition of the area, but Um?pati Siv?carya, a Citamparam priest who be? came a leader of that movement, was asked to give up his priestly standing. The Ved?nta matas were further away, but had a greater impact on all-Indian pil? grimage patterns. It was in response to their theological emphases that the name of the temple was modified from Cirr-Ampalam or 'Little Hal? to Citam? param or 'Consciousness Space', and the ritual of the Rahacayam or 'Secret' was introduced in order to symbolically convey the Ved?ntic idea of the Unknowable Absolute or Nirkuna Pirahman. Since the building of the Kovintar?can shrine in the sixteenth century, and the development of the Rahacayam lattice ritual about the same time, the changes in the temple complex have tended to be for the comfort and convenience of worshippers and have not involved the introduction of major new ritual patterns. The conservatism, which characterized the temple priests' resistance to change at every stage, has in recent centuries come to be considered a sacred trust in which a special religious tradition is carefully preserved in a setting involving major social and political transformations. Conclusion The history of the Citamparam temple complex is an intricate story of con? tinuity and change. On the one hand continuity is the foundation of the re? ligious meaning associated with the temple. The same lineage of priests still do the ritual in the same thatch-style 'Little Hall' much as they did in the seventh century when the Saiva hymn-singers made the first recorded visits to the place. On the other hand this worship has been associated successively with a primitive K?li cult (Stage One), a peasant hymn-singing cult (Stage Two), a royal cult (Stage Three), a priestly linka cult (Stage Four), and a meditative Ved?nta cult (Stage Five). Each of these cults was closely associated with the historical forces which were part of the era in which it came to prominence, and yet each left a legacy on the ritual life of the temple complex long after the era with which it was initially associated had passed from the scene. The religious system of a temple complex such as Citamparam might use? fully be viewed as a communication network in which its continuity is seen as analogous to the structure of language and its changes as the shifting vocabulary of language. Changes such as the expulsion of K?li worship from the central temple area, or the introduction of hymn-singing, linka worship or Rahacayam worship were important changes indeed, and yet each was accomplished without 224 [20]</page><page sequence="21">losing the sense that a more permanent structure was the key to the religious meaning found in the place. The language of worship was new in each gener? ation in the sense that important new terms came to be used, and yet it was old in that the ritual never lost the underlying patterning and structure which would have made it meaningful to someone who had worshipped there a thou? sand or more years earlier. Art History, by precisely identifying and dating the changes in the life of a worship centre, brings to consciousness the colour, shape and sound of the vocabulary in which religious meaning is expressed in each era. Histories of Religion, by pointing out the structure on which the continuity of meaning is based, and into which the changing vocabulary is drawn, bring out the dimension of the changing scene which links it with larger patterns of human meaning. Histories of Indian art which do not link the special styles of different eras with the enduring structures of meaning in the culture are in danger of tending to look like dusty records of a dead past. Religious studies which try to skip over the particulars of history and define the eternal truths of Hinduism usually lack the vocabulary to show how people derived meaning from such generalities. Religious history built up by looking behind the detailed record of artistic ac? complishment would seem to come closer to accounting for the way in which people communicate meaning to one another in living traditions which employ a changing vocabulary even as they preserve a continuing system of meaning.
