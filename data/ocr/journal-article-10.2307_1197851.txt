<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCHLEIERMACHER TODAY GORDON BOIT WELLMAN IT WAS formerly said that a theological epoch began with Friedrich Schleiermacher. Today liberalism which he helped to establish is giving way to reactionary thought in theology, consistent with the loss to liberty along many lines of intellectual endeavor and behavior. At the beginning of this century there was a revival of theological appraisal of Schleier- macher on the Continent, but the effort toward a constructive system of thought was early frustrated by the advance of the social sciences and the war. Confusion and uncertainty since those days have made easier the appeal of authoritative and dogmatic ideas but have increased the difficulties of the sacri- ficial spirit necessary for the pursuit of disinterested truth. Schleiermacher was one of the inspired pioneers of our historical and critical approach to the ultimate problems of religion. As a complete attempt to explain the mystery of God and the human soul, his theology cannot meet the tests of the ancient summae, but it is one of the last essays of the Protestant Christian mind to view the problems of religion with a systematic thoroughness, and as such it demands a more intelligent attention by us than has recently been given. The literature upon Schleiermacher during the last two dec- ades is amazingly small. The centenary of his death in I934 passed almost without notice. His theology and preaching awoke the nineteenth century to new thought; once they brought thousands to a fresh moral endeavor, and at one time his written theology was thought to constitute the greatest document of Christianity since Calvin's Institutes. Now there is scarcely faint praise and little constructive criticism. Karl Barth has been severe in denunciation but has given slight stimulus to discriminating thought upon Schleiermacher's i6I</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION work. Wobbermin is true to the old Schleiermacher tradition; however, his influence is unfortunately unimportant outside a few German universities. Beyond conservative German the- ology it is doubtful if there is a modern theology which would claim Schleiermacher as its father and inspiration. This is the more strange since Schleiermacher was a bold adventurer in the beginning of many of the fields of social and religious sciences which have so largely taken the place of theoretical systems. For the sake of truth and historical clarity it is time to look dis- interestedly and critically at the work of Schleiermacher. The implications of his thought and his moral approach to old prob- lems are of serious importance to modern thought. To read the Reden, the Kurze Darstellung, and the Christliche Glaube today is an enlightening and somewhat humbling experi- ence. Many ideas which we pride ourselves upon being dis- coveries of our day are discussed here with simplicity and aston- ishing assurance, and with refreshing relief from our present complicated psychological terminology. There are many sug- gestions that it would be profitable to rethink in the light of our day; the most vital of those concerning his approach to the whole problem of religion is the proposal to investigate the na- ture of the religious consciousness. It is the purpose of this pa- per to call attention briefly to the acute analysis of the meaning and implications of this problem by Schleiermacher, especially as one reacts to it today. While it is true that Schleiermacher was free from an en- tangling nomenclature and critical apparatus, in coming to this fundamental question of the nature of religion, it must be real- ized that he had to lift himself free from age-long methods of scholasticism and seek "fresh woods and pastures new." He cut away the immense impedimenta that have long incumbered the "Queen of Sciences" and attacked this prime problem with the abandon of one who has experienced deeply. No more orig- inal and creative step had been taken in theological study in two hundred years, and it opened the door to an amazingly new I62</page><page sequence="3">SCHLEIERMACHER TODAY conception of man's relation to God. Schleiermacher stepped outside the method of assumption and proof and applied his insight and learning to the problem with the insatiate zeal of his contemporary, Kant. His purpose was clear; it was nothing less than to discover the ultimate grounds of the religious con- sciousness before he tried to erect thereon any system of the- ology. The originality of his approach made expression in lan- guage difficult, but the possibilities for enlightenment were many and rich, as is attested by the conspicuous place the prob- lem holds in the work of his followers. For them as well as for Schleiermacher, Calvinism and Lutheran Confessionalism be- came obsolete as they hastened to think through the significance of his pronouncement on the nature of the religious conscious- ness thus isolated for the first time from the speculative aspects of a systematic theology. Although their early attempts to use his conclusions are often seriously distorted, after Schleier- macher this problem is essentially fundamental. The time was not ripe in the nineteenth century for the diverse sciences of our day to widen the field by discursive investigation, but a world Schleiermacher never dreamed about was opened by his honest statements of fact. We are in a position more fairly able to judge the worth of his revelation; certainly to try to do so is one of the most important historical problems of the science of religion. Schleiermacher's final position is found in the Christliche Glaube; this, his mature work, is definitive, and all discussion of his theology must meet the arguments in this book. He began the Glaubenslehre, as it is familiarly called, with neither the doc- trine of God nor the doctrine of man, but immediately expound- ed the problem we are discussing -the nature of religion-be- cause with rare genius he perceived the critical position of self- consciousness in determining man's uniqueness as a religious person. By the simplicity with which he marks this differentiat- ing consciousness he clarifies all former attempts to discover the essence and character of the complex phenomenon we call re- !63</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION ligion. The possession of this awareness of self is due neither to empirical nor to rational experience, for Schleiermacher claims that it is our immediate and veritable existential life, our sein (unmittelbar selbstbewusstsein). From self-consciousness arises the experience of dependence, the natural reaction of the alone discovering his aloneness. Hence came the famous definition of Schleiermacher that religion is the feeling of absolute de- pendence, or, as he pertinently wrote in the fourth paragraph of the Glaubenslehre, "also das sich selbst gleiche Wesen der Fr6mmigkeit ist dieser," an awareness of simple and complete dependence on God. The meaning of these words is not super- ficially clear; yet highly concentrated as they are, his whole theory rests like an inverted pyramid upon this brief proposi- tion. Confusion has existed in the minds of his interpreters ever since the first publication of the Glaubenslehre in I82I, but as Schleiermacher makes this definition axiomatic we begin here; this is primary for understanding his mind. This statement contains two keywords, schlechthin, usually translated "absolutely," and Gefiihl, naturally, "feeling." The exact meaning of each is of the greatest consequence to Schleier- macher's intention. Of schlechthin he makes particular use in discussing the whole problem of religious self-consciousness, but the definite meaning is difficult to elucidate. He, himself, tells us that he was seeking a word to express a problem in his mind. There is need of a more discriminating exegesis and translation. By its use he seems to mean that the dependence which it modifies is complete in the sense of being timeless, yet utterly determined. He contrasts such a state with temporal existence and apparent freedom, for self-consciousness, he shows, is one with an existence simple and unconditioned of the dependent sort, "an existence without becoming," as Plato says in the Timaeus. Schleiermacher's attention is fixed upon the divine relationship from which there is no escape; it is, he claims, an original and unique revelation. The Barthians have often criticized Schleiermacher for treating religious experience as if 164</page><page sequence="5">SCHLEIERMACHER TODAY it were a human instinct. If we mean by instinct in this instance what James and Bergson mean-an instinct become conscious- then their criticism is correct and Schleiermacher's use of the word schlechthin emphasizes the fact which he considered para- mount, namely, that this direct sense is a conscious intuition of God, something more than the sense of our discovered ego, and something constantly and completely present, known sub specie aeternitatis. This latter assertion of God dependence is the cen- tral fact of the religious experience, and the relevancy of this to the Bible and truth Schleiermacher made the fulcrum for his further theological speculation. "Feeling" (Gefiihl), likewise, is a word fraught with meaning as Schleiermacher uses it; in Pauline fashion he found it neces- sary to put his own rich experience in the language of every day. The possible epistemological significance of this word is best dis- cussed under Schleiermacher's thought about God. These, then, are two of the reasons the definition has received diverse interpre- tations. Indeed it is doubtful if he ever intended this single sen- tence to be considered independent of his explanations. Many propositions in the Glaubenslehre express principles: at least two underlie his whole discussion of the nature of religion- those which we have already given, that religion is due to an immediate self-consciousness, and that the particular essence of this consciousness which makes it religious is a kind of depend- ence (abhangig). This was revolutionary thinking in 1821 and still is pregnant with meaning. Any historical interpretation must regard the peculiar background of the author, but there is great danger of misunderstanding Schleiermacher by not being aware of how far he transcends his different early influences. In him many conflicting currents were surging-independence fostered by the Romanticists, deep piety wrought into his very being by his Moravian home, rational speculation and doubts raised by the new philosophers and his Greek learning, and beneath all a cap- tivating revelation, prophetic in its moral urge and mystical in I65</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION its inward assurance. The result of all this was the determina- tion to place religion beyond particular aspects, upon a founda- tion broad and true enough to meet every approach. To do this he proposed a study of the diathesis of religion that its essential constitutional nature might be known. This he actually carried out with scientific and critical thoroughness. That Schleier- macher could view so disinterestedly and with such searching inquiry his own religious experience is the indication of a truly noble and educated mind. It is remarkable that Schleiermacher, the Herrnhuter and Platonist, should have been the first one to bring a constructive attack upon this ancient problem of the Greeks. In modern times the nature of religion came late to be questioned, for there are few David Humes, and one's own reli- gion comes bound hand and foot with the holy. God's presence, the sense of worship, and the apparent consistency of moral re- quirements seem to carry their own assurance until the inquir- ing spirit of truth arrives. So it has been a constant source of misunderstanding not to detach Schleiermacher from this or that part of his background. His use of the word "feeling" undoubtedly was suggested by his Romanticist environment, but it was a mistake to read no deeper. It is still commonly represented that he indorsed the sentimental and emotional solution of the problem of the origin and nature of religion. Such words as these go unchallenged to- day: "To Schleiermacher .... religion was neither reason nor morality, neither thought nor action, but an emotional con- templation of the universe."' A re-reading of Schleiermacher does not bear with this conclusion. He leaned toward the in- ductive method of thought procedure, and it is clear that he de- sired to build a constructive criticism of deep, rational, and moral implication upon the foundation of the true nature of re- ligious consciousness. To return to the Glaubenslehre with an open mind will be the only sane way to understand Schleier- macher. I Paul Elmer More, Shelburne Essays, V (Putnam, I908), 115. I66</page><page sequence="7">SCHLEIERMACHER TODAY The Glaubenslehre shows with brilliant power of discernment and arresting observation an analysis of self-consciousness. Schleiermacher contrasts this unique possession of man with all other consciousness. Self-consciousness accompanies the arrival of that august moment in life that is so vital today to the psy- chologist, when man rises above all other animal life and knows himself. It is distinguished by new visions-the aesthetic, the moral, and the religious. Schleiermacher wisely realized the impossibility in his day of any scientific approach to the ques- tion of the origin of these spiritual insights. It is the nature and not the engendering of religious experience which he discusses, but this has not always been clear to his interpreters. Schleier- macher's work, compared with the contemporary efforts to un- derstand the basis of religious life, is of another pattern. It can only be understood by his own epistemological method. He does not assume emotional or any other particular content for this peculiar consciousness; rather it is to be understood that man's arrival in self-consciousness is a leap forward in aware- ness; it is the simplest state of apprehension, an experience be- come known. Words belie the meaning, and one must explore Schleiermacher's own salient expressions to comprehend this state of knowledge which he would describe. Owing to Kant, he was not misled by these apparent abstractions, for he real- ized that at the same moment when moral and religious truth first burst upon the human mind, the limiting conditions of time and space determine the elements of that experience. On the other hand, these categories did not disturb his major asser- tion of the spiritual reality behind them. Epistemology and psychology have been inadequate to ex- plain this fundamental position of Schleiermacher, because he takes self-consciousness as a natural state, a universal human endowment, one of the imponderables. When all life is on the scales, who can stand off and compare significant distinctions? To Schleiermacher's greatness, he did not turn to subjectivity; he knew the dangers of ipseity, for Fichte was his contemporary. I67</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION One thing above all he wished to do-that was to establish the religious consciousness as an objective reality. God had trans- figured his life; he knew deeper than anyone else that there was truth in that, and his tragic experiences and learning showed him that this truth was beneath all individual forms and all re- ligions. There was an indubitable reality in this divine experi- ence; here he began all inquiry. The close association in Schleiermacher's mind of God and dependence when he uses the word "feeling" shows his ultimate intention. Conscious of the difficulties of the term God in al- most the degree of our modern dilemma, he went beyond the idea conditioned by our sense of dependence. Although these are among the most difficult of his ideas to understand, he says clearly that the experience denoted by "feeling" is a subject- object one, intensely welded into one convincement. That is the first proposition; the second is the fact of its inner dual nature, for besides dependence there is a purposive element which arouses one to moral endeavor. Schleiermacher thus, as his earlier work shows, recognized the twofold character of reli- gion-that it consists of a peculiar awareness and a doing-some- thing-about-it. If we were to speak epistemologically, the reli- gious self-consciousness would be placed among conceptual ex- periences; that is, as used in the Glaubenslehre, the phrase does not stand for an impression or a perception; rather it is a knowl- edge in the sense of consciousness definitely embracing reality. Fundamentally, it was the cognitive fact and not the volitional or the feeling element with which Schleiermacher started. He evidently felt the rebellious nature of all words to elucidate his intention, for he tries again and again with many offset phrases to describe this common human experience which is behind all historical religions, one of the self-evident facts, but high myste- ries of life. He really makes an ontological postulate the sine qua non for his further interpretation, and thus it is difficult to find any historical or psychological theory to contradict his basic po- sition. Like modem anti-Newtonian theories of time and space, I68</page><page sequence="9">SCHLEIERMACHER TODAY Schleiermacher's idea of the nature of religion reached beyond the relative and made a venture to picture the elemental fact itself. Without possible proof, in the sense of a priori or a pos- teriori reasoning, he made bold to state the facts as they seemed inevitable to him. He would be surprised today to see how far his main idea and its corollaries have received confirmation, but it is significant that this has taken place less through discursive reasoning than by quasi-inferences and the elimination of possi- bilities. The dual nature of the religious self-consciousness is of the first importance to Schleiermacher's theory. We have said that he considered it both teleological and divine, and that these two aspects are one, not set in different categories, but complemen- tary-a single experience viewed in two ways. He calls them the active and the receptive elements and objectively he seems to postulate God as the determining power of both, although God is often identified with the receptive element, meaning the object of dependence looked at from within. This divine factor has long troubled the serious student of Schleiermacher, as wit- nessed by the opinions of writers from Ritschl to Pfleiderer and Troeltsch. Schleiermacher was a pantheist, a mystic, a sensa- tionalist-so the phrases have passed down the years to us. The truth is, Schleiermacher with the ardor of a true theist pro- claimed that our relation was one of dependence on an existing divine reality without ourselves. This is transcendence. Abso- lute dependence meant to him a unique relationship such as is not envisioned by the rest of life. In the fourth paragraph of the Glaubenslehre he explains in positive terms the transcendency of God, but, always being fearful of words, he carefully put this in the tentative language of a determining power without our- selves, which meets us in the religious consciousness. God-con- sciousness and self-consciousness are inextricably intertwined because they are one in reality, yet God is the divine causality; Schleiermacher is careful to keep that point of view. Later, when discussing the divine attributes, he says that they are not I69</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION unique elements in the being of God, but only ways in which we know God; they are determining influences upon us of the real, which alone gives them reality in our consciousness. It was this refusal of Schleiermacher to imagine the being of God that has given many the idea that he was a pantheist. He really allowed neither pantheism nor mysticism to darken his concept of a transcendent God, although his theory does approximate an immanence doctrine which is not contradictory to transcend- ence, according to which our dependence is of external origin and related to an external object, yet is of the order of existence by which "we live and move and have our being." Schleier- macher would have agreed with Augustine, "Non ergo essem, deus meus, non omnino essem, nisi esses in me."2 Such imma- nence does not oppose a doctrine of transcendence wherein God is ontologically a separate being; it simply continues his creative life through man. In paragraph eight of the Glaubenslehre, Schleiermacher remarks that the distinction between a God outside the world and God in the world cannot be made in lan- guage, but that pantheism as negativing theism endangers the truth of our fundamental religious experience. All this shows how premature it is to make the statement commonly used that Schleiermacher believed that religion is a feeling of dependence and to leave it there unexplained. At least we do violence to the facts to call him a pantheist or sentimentalist. Both of these positions he positively denounced, and his most vigorous think- ing is directed toward a transcendent type of God-idea, con- genial to much modern scientific and religious thought. Doubtless, too, much of the extreme mystical interpretation of Schleiermacher came from acceptance of some of his conclu- sions without a deeper understanding of his whole contention. Since the idea of the divine element in man's experience is uni- versal in human nature, it is evident that it cannot be complete in any one historical religious expression. So Schleiermacher argued that this God-consciousness stands independent of any 2 Confessions, Book I, chap. ii. I70</page><page sequence="11">SCHLEIERMACHER TODAY ancient proof and that it is an integral part of the inner experi- ence. He appealed to the individual sense of God in man; it sounds mystical, but he presupposes the reality of God, objec- tively related, not mystically united. This is substantiated in his discussion concerning man's consciousness of the world contrasted with our consciousness of God. The former he calls a consciousness of unity; the latter, dependence. The differen- tiation is partly psychological, but evidently Schleiermacher was striving to present a real metaphysical ground for his the- istic conviction. Of course mystical elements there are in Schleiermacher, and the earlier works show a stronger inclina- tion in that direction; however, the Glaubenslehre should be the standard, and there mysticism is subordinate to theism. We have said that Schleiermacher showed that he regarded the experience described by the word "feeling" to include not only a receptive awareness of dependence but in some sense an active element, an apparent contradiction in terms if it were not true, as we contend, that the use of Gefiihl completely tran- scends its primary emotional meaning. The Glaubenslehre ex- plains that the moment of self-consciousness is not only reli- giously significant by divine affirmation but it is morally sig- nificant in its apprehension of right and wrong. The moral sense is awakened and the individual is committed to a moral pur- pose. With a zeal which delighted Ritschl, Schleiermacher ex- plored the values inherent in such an activity and with a true understanding of Aristotle he explained the teleological nature of the moral consciousness. He was too good a Greek scholar to mistake the final cause; for him, as for Aristotle, the ro ov 'evEKa is implied in the purpose. Immensely important to his further theological constructive thought, this implicit final cause be- came for him the Kingdom of God. Every single act and every totality of acts are parts of this spiritual end in the Christian's life, a purpose never complete, but the present urge of every conation. Far-reaching inferences follow this striking interpre- tation of the central teaching of the Synoptic Gospels. One re- I7I</page><page sequence="12">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION suit is the fact that the teleological element gives ground for re- interpreting the redemptive work of Jesus and the whole doc- trine of the church, a subject in Schleiermacher which needs today a separate study beyond the scope of this paper. Also, the teleological in religion seen in this light becomes the decisive factor in the critical study of historical religions and in their comparison. Hence Schleiermacher became the instigator of much that is best in the science of religion, the real value of which has not begun to be appreciated. It is this direction of Schleiermacher's thought that gives fur- ther credence to his position as a theist; for he clearly states that the inner purpose is but the other side of the feeling of depend- ence; it is a moral revelation penetrating the depths of human consciousness and knitting us, as in the redemptive act of Chris- tianity, to God in the closest union. This, too, he regards as a unique, divine revelation to man, and on this principle is based his whole systematic theology which moves out from the analy- sis of the nature of religion to the historical Christian doctrines. We are reminded of the words of Royce of a later day when Schleiermacher says that the act of the Redeemer becomes our act as we meet the demands of our religious self-consciousness, that is, as we feel the incentive toward the Kingdom of God. Schleiermacher began and ruled the nineteenth century of Continental Protestant theology; now the second quarter of the twentieth century gives us a point to judge him again more dis- interestedly. He emancipated the most sacred trust of human life-the spirit of truth-from dogmatism and intolerance, and spoke with a noble freedom, graced by his Greek spirit of in- quiry and self-criticism. He has been the inspiration of the modem approach to the study of religion and the founder of a new method for the understanding of the life of Jesus. We, who know how easily these precious directions toward truth can be lost, plead for a fresh evaluation of Schleiermacher's creative work, because a step toward theological certainty is a just ap- preciation of the thought preceding our day. Schleiermacher I72</page><page sequence="13">SCHLEIERMACHER TODAY 173 saw little truth in definite forms and dogmas, but he was sure of the divine essence of the human soul and of the relation of that to the redemptive purpose of God. He went so far as to discourage in his friends and students all certainty in forms of personality as we know them here in time and space, and all crude anthropomorphic ideas of God, but he never failed to announce with prophetic zeal the reality of the eternal laws of morality and God's love. Thus he conceived the nature of re- ligion through the profoundest experience of his Christian reve- lation wherein Jesus' life and teaching brought to him the con- firmation of the redemptive purpose within himself.
