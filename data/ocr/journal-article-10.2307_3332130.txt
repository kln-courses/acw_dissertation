<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Metaphorical Method WARREN SHIBLES The metaphorical method is based on the insight that each philosophy, science, or mode of understanding is founded on one or more basic or root metaphors which are then expanded into various universes of dis- course. By seemingly incongruous juxtapositions new knowledge is attained and revealing hypotheses suggested. A knowledge of meta- phor allows us to see what can be said and how to say it. It also helps us to avoid being captivated by our metaphors which we unconsciously thought were literal truths. Perhaps the joke played most often on the thinkers of the past is that of their having taken their theories and ideas as literal truths. This is as true of scientists as of others. Mathematics, symbolic logic, and geometry are metaphorical systems. We apply numbers, lines, triangles, etc., metaphorically to objects we observe. Euclidean geometry is only one model or metaphor and yields only one description of reality. Contemporary physicists now sometimes assert that we were seriously misled by taking the Cartesian coordi- nate system (of three or even four dimensions) as our model. Symbolic logicians try to see reality only in terms of a single kind of metaphor or model. Today it may be seen that models in science and philosophy do not merely illustrate otherwise obtainable knowledge but rather constitute it. A diagram, formula, description, etc., is part of its object. The considerations of the metaphorical notion of seeing-as even suggest that metaphors and models partially determine how and what we actually see and observe. We see things in terms of our models, just as when we wear blue glasses the world becomes blue. WARREN SHIBLES is head of the department of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, Whitewater. In addition to numerous articles for historical and philosophical journals, he has written such books as Models of Ancient Greek Philosophy, An Analysis of Metaphor, Emotions, and Death.</page><page sequence="2">26 WARREN SHIBLES Inquiry presupposes language. To construct a theory or make a state- ment requires language. Even the view that language is inadequate presupposes language. Also our knowledge of and access to the so-called mental states is derived mainly from what one says or writes. We have no clear knowledge of what a "thought" or "idea"' is in itself; it seems to be an empty category. Thus language has epistemological primacy. To inquire into a term, phrase, or statement - e.g., What is an "emo- tion"? What is "time"? What is "death"? - we must first see how these words are used in everyday expressions and in what situations or con- texts they are used. Find out what the actual concrete and detailed use of such terms is in such situations. The meaning of such terms is revealed by their use in the context of a language and concrete situation. Other than as a use, it is not clear what a meaning is. Meaning is a synonym of thought and both are pseudo-psychological categories because we have no evidence for or access to such so-called states. We do not just see, feel, or experience thought or meaning. They do not come up. We only see and hear language and objects. To find out what "Hello" means we need to know a language, and to know in what situations these sounds are spoken or these marks are written. Their meaning is such usages, not something separate, something hidden and mental. It is a naming fallacy to think that words just name, e.g., name objects or thoughts. Once we see how the language in question is actually used, we can see whether what we usually say makes any sense: "Time flies," "Time marches on," "Time passes." It is usually found that what we say con- sists of metaphors which we mistakenly take literally. This is called the metaphor-to-myth fallacy. When metaphors are taken literally, by expanding the metaphor we can reduce it to absurdity and show it to be in fact a disguised joke. For example, of the statement "Time passes" one may ask, "What does it pass?" and so begin to show that possibly it does not make sense to say that time passes. A definition, like a metaphor, may be taken in many ways but can- not, without loss, be reduced to one literal interpretation. Once one has a model or definition, like metaphor it must be developed, ex- panded, and supported to make it intelligible. Once we have a defi- nition or model we may ask about it a) What does it mean? b) What is it like? and c) Is it relevant? The model should be able to withstand questions and counterexamples, e.g., "If time passes how does it do it?" "What is time like?" Metaphor derives from the Greek metapherein (meta, beyond:</page><page sequence="3">THE METAPHORICAL METHOD 27 pherein, to bring) meaning "transfer." One term is transferred from its normal usage to a new usage, e.g., "Point to your imagination." Meta- phor is itself defined metaphorically in terms of "transfer" and "figure." It is also spoken of as a filter, stereoscope, or as tension, energy, dead, or in terms of a "tenor" and "vehicle" (I. A. Richards). This is because all definitions are metaphorical. Robert Frost wrote, "All thinking is metaphorical." All definitions are metaphorical including the definition of metaphor because we think of one thing in terms of another, in terms of familiar models, and there is no one literal, universal model or defi- nition which will apply to all situations and contexts at all times for all people. "Justice is that which is in accord with the laws of the state" is not an adequate definition because we often change the laws. Thus to define a term is to take a model or metaphor, one perspective, one way of looking at the term. There is no single definition or aspect of metaphor but many. Models, pictures, diagrams, maps, definitions, descriptions, hypotheses, fictions, and formulas are types of metaphors. Metaphor is itself an art form and ought to be taught and engaged in in its own right and on the level of any other art. One may be involved in music, or one may be involved in making metaphors. One sees the world metaphorically and lives and dies his metaphor. Courses in aes- thetics, literary criticism, creative writing, etc., should also place great stress on the topic of metaphor for the understanding which an analysis of metaphor can give to them. If we know the boundaries, forms, and possibilities of metaphor we are in a better position to understand poetry and prose. What characterizes contemporary pop art and new art appears clearly to be a mere metaphorical juxtaposition for its own sake. In one painting middle-class men rain down from the sky, and in another an apple is as large as a room. This sort of juxtaposition also characterizes contemporary music, writing, film, drama. This suggests the return to the conceit of surrealism. If the artist knew more about metaphor, he would be better able to create art, more conscious of what he was doing and of the possibilities of his craft. Without being conscious of metaphor and one's metaphors, one becomes their captive. The metaphorical method provides a criterion for judging works of art. Criticize a poem or other work of art for its metaphors. Scale: (1) Excellent (2) Good (3) Fair (4) Poor. State its effect after the number to qualify the number, e.g., (1) surprise (2) humor (3) eluci- date. Then specify type, e.g., juxtaposition. Thus for one metaphor or poem the analysis might be "2 (good), perspectival, type: juxtaposition of two images."</page><page sequence="4">28 WARREN SHIBLES Most generally metaphor is a deviation: 1. Deviation from usual diction. Any word may be used in a new way. Any word can be used as a metaphor, even the word "metaphor." 2. Deviation from grammar. Any grammatical rule may be deviated from. Any part of speech may be deviated from or interchanged with any other, e.g., nouns used as verbs, "They don't cotton to it." Even commas and question marks may be used metaphorically. We often refer to "poetic license," but this may also be called "metaphoric license." 3. Deviation from the usual contextual or situational use of words. Words usually belonging to one context or universe of discourse are used in another or very different one either consciously or by mistake, e.g., "Feeling is chemical," "Twig of joy," "Twitch of remorse." Use of the wrong word for a context is sometimes called "catachresis." 4. Deviation from normal behavior. Gestures and actions may de- viate from the usual accepted practices thus creating metaphorical behavior, e.g., a boy who walks upside down. He, as well as his view of the world, describe a metaphorical perspective. Play acting, pretending, imitating, pantomime, role-playing and children's games, e.g., "You be the king and I'll be the knight," all are behavioral metaphors. 5. Deviation from established categories, e.g., "A grief ago." Old categories such as subject-object, fact-fiction, cause-effect, mind-body, sensuous-nonsensuous, true-false, emotion-reason, life-death are broken down. The animate may be regarded as inanimate. It may be found that a statement may be neither true nor false but meaningless. 6. Deviation from culture, custom, habit, the expected, familiar beliefs, what is considered proper, the practical, the logical, the self- evident, the everyday, the literal, the real (yielding the as-if or imagi- nary), the normal, or cause and effect order of events. Such deviations because they are new and unfamiliar make metaphors seem to be the language of the schizophrenic. Poets, lovers, philosophers are often thought mad, e.g., by Plato. G. K. Chesterton (1936) even speaks of metaphors as being "mad." The poet is spoken of as being "inspired." The poet William Wordsworth speaks of poetry as an excess or over- flow of the emotions. The artist is often thought to have to be in some special state in order to create works of art. The poet does not talk as we usually talk. His expressions are odd. One doesn't usually talk poetry. We call that which is out of the ordinary "emotion." An emo- tional statement is one which disregards usual criteria of truth, e.g., "We are all part of one great mind." But poetry and insanity are often</page><page sequence="5">THE METAPHORICAL METHOD 29 defined as being deviations in the first place. It is not necessarily a state the poet or madman is in, but the fact that both talk differently from the way we usually do, that characterizes them as being either mad or artists. Metaphors are deviations from the norm. We have direct access to the metaphors, not to their "emotions." One need not be mad to create metaphors. Thus a person is insane or is a poet because of his metaphors. It is not that one is an artist or poet because he has a faculty of imagination, a creative mind, or genius. Rather, to be a poet or an artist is mainly to deviate by means of metaphor. No internal mentalism such as emotion, mind, or imagination need be assumed. Such entities are today regarded by many psychologists and philoso- phers as fictions. Mental states are artificial metaphorical constructs. One is creative because he used metaphors; one does not use meta- phors because he is creative. This conforms with the method of look- ing to see what we in fact do, rather than imposing a theory or pseudo- psychology on what we do. The new seems strange or surprising. By observing different customs, cultures, and languages one sees the world and one's emotions in a new or metaphorical way. Objects and people are associated with different words, sounds, and practices. We are often intolerant of what is new or strange to us. Seeing it as metaphor may help to make it more acceptable. One may purposely make the familiar seem strange to give insight into it, e.g., ask questions for which we usually think we know the answers, such as, "What is love?" "What is an idea?" "What is the number one?" Ask questions usually asked by children. 7. Deviation from usual perception. A poor person may actually see a quarter as larger than does a rich person. This is sometimes referred to as "seeing-as." This leads to imagery, ecstatic visions, or halluci- nations. A simile is a comparison usually involving the term "like" or "as," e.g., "The brain is like a computer." Metaphor is said to be a con- densed simile, a simile without the use of "like" or "as," e.g., "The brain is a computer." A metaphor may not involve the word "is" but may be a single word such as saying "goodby" when greeting someone. But to say a metaphor is just a condensed simile is misleading. It is only one definition, model, or way of looking at metaphor and can only account for a limited range of metaphors. To say "A is B" is to say something more than or different from "A is like B." "The brain is</page><page sequence="6">30 WARREN SHIBLES like a computer" is an open simile because the specific sense of the likeness is unspecified. If it is specified, it becomes a closed simile, e.g., 'The brain is like a computer in processing bits of information." A metaphor is even more open than an open simile. It is multi-meaning and can be given a great many interpretations. Because metaphor is not adequately reduced to the literal, it is thought to be emotive. Democ- ritus asserted, "The world is atomic," and throughout history this metaphor has been given various interpretations. One expansion of this metaphor was to regard ideas as atoms, and one spoke of the "asso- ciation of ideas" as he spoke of the "association of atoms" or as it was sometimes called, "mental chemistry." Thus a metaphor cannot be reduced to one literal interpretation without loss of meaning. Meta- phors are perspectival and multi-meaning. To take a metaphor in only one way is to take it literally and so create a "metaphor to myth" fallacy, to be captivated by a metaphor. Most people today still erroneously think there is such a thing as mind. There is no evidence for the existence of such an entity, and the theory that the mind is a container of ideas can no longer be held. "Mind" now only makes sense metaphorically or as elliptical for speech, thought, or action. One may take "mind" literally. This may be exposed and reduced to absurdity by replying to the question "What is on your mind?" with "Some dust." It is as absurd to have dust on a mind as to have a mind at all. To take mind literally is to commit the metaphor to myth fallacy. This also is an example of how metaphor can create humor and at the same time give insight. Many types of humor or wit are, in fact, types of metaphor: any breach of the usual order of events; importing into one situation what belongs to another; anything masquerading as something it is not; word play, puns, double meanings; nonsense; forbidden breach; novelty, freshness, unexpectedness, escape; irony, mimicry, and imitation. The conceit is a farfetched or extravagant metaphor which involves wit and cleverness but nevertheless may also give profound insight. "Man is a machine," now a familiar or "dead" metaphor, was once thought to be a conceit or a joke. Today it is one of our most captivating meta- phors and is frequently, though often erroneously, taken literally. Metaphor has gradations of belief. It may be variously taken as serious, literal, hypothetical, fictional, false, playful, etc. One type (though not every type) of metaphor is based on analogy which is somewhat like simile. In four-term analogy A: B::C: D, e.g., Sound: air:: light: "ether." Because sound travels through air it was</page><page sequence="7">THE METAPHORICAL METHOD 31 thought that light might travel through a medium, ether. This analogy is then a hypothesis. Analogy and metaphor are often used to create new discoveries, give insight or new knowledge, and they do this partly by deviating from old categories. Such hypotheses, however, may be found to lack confirmation, to be misleading analogies. This was the case with ether. Such a medium lacks confirmation. Also we only know about other people's feelings and thoughts by an analogical inference from our own case. We know of our own case partly by means of an intersubjective language. A category mistake, sort crossing, or type crossing involves using a word or sentence in a new context or category without realizing it. Some category mistakes are: to talk of mental "process" in the same way we talk of physical process; to speak of the experience of seeing as if it were chemical; to talk of "gush," "flow," "damming up," or "release" of emotions literally as if "emotive water" were flowing within us; to take "time flies" or "time passes" literally. Category mistake thus often reduces to the metaphor to myth fallacy. Most or all of the terms used to describe mental phenomena and internal states are metaphorical and should not be taken literally; e.g., "stream of con- sciousness." Metaphor allows us to try to represent the so-called inner emotion by means of outer or external phenomena, e.g., sharp pain, agi- tation, depression, disturbance, distraction. Such outer representations tend to dissolve emotions as inner states. We know of emotions and individual feelings by means of marks (words) and objects. Some misleading analogies are: "twinge of remorse" is not like "twinge of rheumatism"; "pricking of conscience" is not like "pricking of a fin- ger"; "glow of pride" is not like "glow of warmth." The so-called inner is appropriated, especially to seen outer objects. We may have learned to think of pains as round or square rather than sharp and dull. The above gives an idea about what metaphor is. The following are some of the main kinds of metaphor: 1. Synecdoche. The substitution of part for whole: "my wheels" for "my car," "pickpocket" for "thief," "the earth is round," for "the earth is spherical"; whole for part, "go to the university" for "go to class"; yawning for boredom; species for genus; genus for species; the name of the material for the thing made, e.g., "pigskin" for "football"; cause for effect or effect for cause. 2. Metonymy. The substitution of an attribute or association of a</page><page sequence="8">32 WARREN SHIBLES thing for the thing, e.g., "hot" for "angry," "irritation is a buzzing fly," "sadness is walking down a long, grey tunnel," "he sees red," "swollen with pride," "anger is a bull charging," "heat of passion," "burning with love," "bitter tears." Emotions have subjective associations, e.g., brightness and animation go with joy. 3. Anagogical. Refers to a going beyond the literal to the spiritual or mystical. It appears, however, to be the aesthetic experience of a metaphor rather than any kind of transcendence. Similarly the "sub- lime" is merely a lofty feeling one has upon reading, seeing, or hearing a metaphor. "Anagogical" is defined by Webster's Collegiate Dictionary as "interpretation of a word, passage, or text (as of scripture or poetry) that finds beyond the literal, allegorical, and moral senses a fourth and ultimate spiritual or mystical sense." Poets often appear to express the magical transcendent nature of metaphor. It is thought that metaphor is among man's highest achievements, that it can render his most sublime emotions. Max Eastman (1932) even asserts that metaphor is a state one can be in, a state of "heightened consciousness." Perhaps one might call this "metaphor emotion." This view is also presented by literary critics of India. For them "rasa" means "delectation," which is a state of mind of rising to the occasion, a generalized emotion susceptible to enjoy- ment of metaphor. Metaphor can relate the lower to the higher and elevate the lower into the sublime. To romanticize is to elevate lower ideas of objects to higher ones. If the higher is related to the lower, it is called "sinking," e.g., "The King is ticklish." 4. Archetype. A metaphor repeated so often that it seems to be a universal idea or truth. 5. Substitution. This includes substitution of all kinds, e.g., speaking is a substitution of a sound for a thing; "He vents his spleen" for "He is angry." A "kenning" in skaldic writing involves substitution. For "sleep fell on the king," the kenning might be "the death of each day's life fell on the dispenser of rings." Similarly Shakespeare renders sleep as "the death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, chief nourisher in life's feast" (Macbeth II, ii, 37). 6. Juxtaposition. Two objects or words which are not usually asso- ciated with each other are put together. Art (Ars) involves this process and derives from the Aryan root "Ar" meaning "join, put together." Montage in film, collage, the Chinese ideogram, and much of modem</page><page sequence="9">THE METAPHORICAL METHOD 33 art involve juxtaposition often for its own sake. We pin down emotions by comparing them with other experiences. This allows us to be more attentive to the world of feeling. Juxtaposition allows us to vary feelings and emotions with various objects, situations, and other emotions. Perhaps jealousy can be accompanied by delight. One may learn to enjoy war, or laugh at danger. 7. Parataxis. A juxtaposition or placing side by side without comma or separation. 8. Conceit. A farfetched, exaggerated, or bold metaphor; hyperbole. It may, however, be well founded in some ways and give great insight. Hyperbole and conceit may express exaggeration of emotion. Conceits may name and create new ones, e.g., "my love is like a jolly cow which gambols in the meadow," "love is two people both putting a finger in the same puddle," "passion is chocolate and olives." Our everyday experience involves incongruous juxtaposition. We see a work of art, an ash tray, next to them a dog, then a piece of gum, etc. While in love we smell the typewriter ribbon. 9. Reciprocal metaphor. This may also be called an interaction metaphor. It is a way of regarding the elements of metaphor. "Man is a fox" may say something new about man but also something new about a fox. 10. Dead metaphor. A dead metaphor is one which has become so familiar that it is taken as literal. One may be captivated or misled in this way. "Dead" metaphors may be rejuvenated, as in "time passes"; one may ask what or how it passes. Fixed cliches, dialects, slang, and literal language all involve dead metaphor. 11. Mixed metaphor. A combination of several different metaphors. Poets as well as scientists often build one metaphor on another. Mixed metaphor need not be avoided but should be used carefully. 12. Repetition and omitting metaphor. It is metaphor to repeat or omit things not usually repeated or omitted, e.g., one poem consists of the word "cricket" repeated seventy times; "the sky is the sky"; "A is A" (in logic). Poetry often omits something, e.g., a part of speech: "a gentle rain" (verb omitted). 13. Root or fundamental metaphor. Each theory in science, phi- losophy, etc., is based on one or more metaphors or models, e.g., Leu- cippus' "the world is atomic," Thales' "the world is water," or "man is a machine." Because metaphor is the basis of the humanities and sciences, it is able to unite them more than anything else. Metaphor may serve as a basic hypothesis in both areas, e.g., poetry, novels, atomic</page><page sequence="10">34 WARREN SHIBLES models in chemistry, etc. Such metaphors do not merely illustrate reality, but to a large extent constitute it. Metaphors may be expanded into a world view, philosophy, or theory. A poem or novel may be thought of as one or more expanded metaphors. One may see the world through the emotion of joy, happiness, fear, depression. An emotion may serve as a fundamental metaphor through which one sees the world and himself. A person's love for another can spread out over all other things. 14. Unifying metaphor. Metaphors unify when they relate unlike things. By this means everything may be related to everything else and so give poets and others the impression that "all is one" (Parmenides), that there is a universal correspondence of all things or a universal analogy of all things. Metaphor often fuses or synthesizes the elements related. 15. Synaesthetic metaphor. Terms applicable to one sense are applied to those of another, e.g., "high sound," "white noise," "smooth sound," "feel blue." In tone poems the listener is asked to visualize musical sounds. 16. Oxymoron or antithesis. Supposed opposites are combined, e.g., "truth is falsity" (may suggest that nothing is absolutely true or false), "emotion is reason" (may suggest that the categories are artificial or that emotion may be analyzed into rational assertions and assessments), "death is life" (may suggest that death is only a concept of conscious living experience), "to be negative is to be positive" (may suggest that one may advance knowledge by means of criticism), "irrelevance is a tool of relevance" (may suggest that one may, in Shakespeare's words, "by indirection find directions out"). Because metaphor combines unlike terms, it may seem like a riddle, paradox, enigma, miracle, mystery, marvel, revelation, disclosure, or mystical transcendence. It may give the experience we call the "sublime." It does not, however, allow us to actually transcend to a new mystical or magical kind of knowledge. 17. Etymological metaphor. Words are always applied to new situ- ations, thus expanding their uses. Thus metaphor is a principle of the development of language. "Idea" derives from the Greek word for "to see," "melancholy" from "black bile," "express" from "press out." We speak of the "sphere" of knowledge. "Person" derives from "mask." 18. Visual metaphor, e.g., a mermaid. Emblems and icons are visual representations of ideas. A lion represents courage. Poems were once regarded as paintings and it was thought that one should be able to</page><page sequence="11">THE METAPHORICAL METHOD 35 draw or visualize an entire poem. Images often illustrate or ornament ideas, making them sensuous, vivid, and persuasive. Visual metaphor also involves "seeing-as," which was discussed earlier. The imagist poets tried to reduce poetry to a number of juxtaposed images, e.g., "The apparition of these faces in the crowd; Petals on a wet, black bough" (Ezra Pound). 19. Personification. The inanimate is treated as animate. The state is often personified as an organism or family, or is regarded as a busi- ness or machine. "Pathetic fallacy" refers to giving animals the feelings and thoughts of humans. Analogy is sometimes used to avoid anthropo- morphism (making human what is not human) or personification, e.g., man's intelligence is to man as God's intelligence is to God. But even this analogy is anthropomorphic. One may also "dehumanize," or make what is animate or human more inanimate and less human. 20. Therapeutic metaphor. Metaphor may be used to avoid the literal, escape from sorrow or oppressive categories, avoid taboo or un- acceptable language, provide release (catharsis), and give indirect ways of saying things. Euphemism is substitution of an agreeable word for a word we wish to avoid uttering, e.g., "pass away" for die, "slumber room" for "room for the dead." Schizophrenics and others often are able to speak metaphorically about things they cannot face directly or more literally. By means of metaphor one is able to distance himself from an object, person, or situation. Therapy also involves showing one that what he takes literally is really only metaphorical. 21. Elucidating metaphor. Metaphor is often used to clarify, to de- scribe phenomena which cannot otherwise be described. It does this by means of new class inclusions, relating old and new, sensuous and nonsensuous, abstract and concrete, material and immaterial, percep- tible and imperceptible, spiritual and nonspiritual, known and un- known, e.g., a "sleeping" leg is referred to as a soda water feeling. Personality, emotions, and most or all mental states are rendered by metaphors: "stream of consciousness," "flow of emotions," "he is a wolf," "spread some jelly on your life," "to do that is to try to put a spider web together with your fingers." Dreams are interpreted meta- phorically. Metaphors also give insight or new knowledge by breaking down old categories such as mind-body, reason-emotion, etc. They allow us to develop new hypotheses and connections, thus serving as a source of knowledge, discovery, disclosure, and illumination. Metaphor is often a brief way of saying something complex, a summary, elliptical, or condensed statement of much experience, e.g., "he is a good egg."</page><page sequence="12">36 WARREN SHIBLES Some of the techniques of the metaphorical method of solving prob- lems in philosophy, science, and art involve the following: 1. Expanding a model or metaphor. 2. Regarding and treating each word and sentence as a metaphor or model. 3. Constructing analogies, even misleading ones, to give insight. 4. Personifying and deanthropomorphizing. 5. Juxtaposing, deviating, and substituting in the various ways indi- cated earlier, e.g., synaesthesia, relating familiar with unfamiliar, un- known to known, abstract to concrete (especially by giving concrete examples), usual with the strange, animate and inanimate, material to immaterial, juxtaposing unlike contexts, etc. Juxtaposing opposites or antitheses. 6. Creating crisis, elucidating, and tensive metaphors or conceits. By means of the metaphorical method one can advance knowledge and avoid being captivated by one's metaphors. In general in the arts as elsewhere there is a widespread use of meta- phor. There is also a need to hear and create new metaphors for aes- thetic, scientific, and everyday practical reasons. One may find that he has a metaphor hunger which must be satisfied by writing, by the arts, by conversing with those who speak metaphorically, or by creating new scientific models and hypotheses. One may obtain increased satisfaction with a greater knowledge of the nature of metaphor.</page></plain_text>
