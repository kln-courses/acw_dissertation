<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS AT BUYUKTEPE HOYUK, 1992 Third Preliminary Report By ANTONIO SAGONA, ELIZABETH PEMBERTON AND IAN MCPHEE* This brief account concentrates on the results of the third consecutive summer (9 June-18 July) of excavations at Biiyiiktepe Hoyiik, a collaborative expedition between the University of Melbourne and Erzurum Museum conducted by a staff of fifteen.' Many thanks are due to the Ministry of Culture and the Directorate of Museums and Monuments for granting permission to carry out the research, and to their officers who once again showed their customary help- fulness. These gentlemen, particularly Mesut Giing6r, Director of Culture at Erzurum, Abdullah Ta?delen, Director of Erzurum Museum, and Hilmi Ozkorucuklu, representative of the Ministry of Culture, are primarily respon- sible for ensuring that our work progressed without any interruptions. We were delighted by a visit from the Vali of Bayburt and his staff, as well as authorities from Demirozii, including the Kaymakan, who made us welcome and gave us much assistance.2 The discoveries at Biiyiiktepe Hoyiik continue to provide a wholly new understanding of cultural developments in north-eastern Anatolia at different periods from the Early Bronze Age to the Early Roman period. Twenty-three new trenches were opened up to establish a greater horizontal exposure of the important buildings, most of which lay immediately below the surface (Fig. 1). On the basis of our work, we have an overall plan of the circular structure on the summit and a clear idea of the settlement layout on the western flank. The following report outlines the substantive results of our 1992 season. The Early Bronze Age Our suspicion that a crescentic alignment of stones found in trench Q37a in 1991 might be interpreted as the footings of a hut gained support by the discov- ery this season of two areas intended for tents built up against the limestone bedrock.3 One shelter straddles trenches S35b and T35b, the other is located further south in Q33b. The former structure provides the clearer plan. It is irreg- ular in outline consisting of three roughly circular and joining depressions dug out of the easily workable bedrock, which is naturally fractured into manageable blocks (P1. IX (a)). Two of the depressions appear to have been living units, *Pemberton and McPhee are responsible for the discussion on the Late Hellenistic/Early Roman material, Sagona for all other sections. The drawings are by Claudia Sagona, Anna Parker, Oya San and Ozlem Cevik, the trench plans were pro- duced by various site supervisors (see below) and Keppel Tumour, our surveyor, who is also responsible for the site plan. 'For preliminary reports on the first two seasons of work, see Sagona, Pemberton and McPhee 1991; idem 1992. A briefer summary of the 1990 season is given in Sagona 1991, with similar statements on subsequent seasons due to appear in forthcoming volumes of Kazi Sonualarl Toplantisi.

Another possible reconstruction would be of a structure with one or more internal posts support- ing a roof, rather than a central post inserted in a hole. The second shelter is also nestled up against the bedrock and lay immedi- ately beneath a section of Late Hellenistic/Early Roman pavement. Its form is not altogether clear at this stage, but the shelter did contain a plastered hearth area on which was probably positioned an andiron with an anthropomorphic representation similar to the fragment found nearby (Fig. 2: 1). Hearth sur- rounds are a standard feature of Early Trans-Caucasian dwellings. Their wide geographical distribution throughout Anatolia, Trans-Caucasus and the Levant which gave rise to local variations on the basic form is well attested.4 The fragment from Biiyiiktepe with its projecting horn finds its closest parallels to examples from the sites in the Erzurum plain, in particular Pulur and Giizelova.5 Simple though they are, these tent sites are quite significant in so far as they support the idea that aspects of nomadism, or at least transhumance, formed a component in the subsistence of economy of the Early Trans-Caucasian culture. The pottery is typically Early Trans-Caucasian: handmade, tempered with medium to coarse grit and some chaff, and fired twice to effect a contrasting colour scheme. The surfaces are slipped, then burnished or smoothed. The ex- terior on most vessel forms is usually black burnished, though occasionally it is fired to grey or brown. In contrast, the inside surface is generally red smoothed. The exception to this scheme is the ubiquitous bowl with a simple rounded pro- file, which continues to be the most common shape (Fig. 2: 3). It is, as a rule, red on the outside except for the rim which is black burnished like the inside. At times, these bowls are ornamented with a vestigial lug attached to the rim, but on the whole are plain (Fig. 2: 2). Interesting is the deep bowl with a brown (5YR 4.5/6) interior and upper exterior found in Q33b and illustrated in Fig. 2: 5. Its carinated profile has affinities with examples from the earliest deposits at Mokhra Blur, in Armenia, and from Geoy levels K1 and K2, though unlike these eastern examples which are often impressed with a few circles, the Biiytiktepe piece is undecorated.6 Wide-mouthed pots with rounded bellies and an everted lip (Fig. 3: 2) continue to be an important type in this assemblage, a position now shared with recess-necked jars (Fig. 2: 6, 7; 3: 1; 6: 3-5). The smaller, finer vessels tend to have a highly polished outer surface and a well defined juncture between the neck and shoulder (Fig. 2: 6, 7). Some are handled (Fig. 3: 1), but this is not a common practise at Biiyiktepe. Several large straight-necked jars were found toward the end of the season. Although there was no time to reconstruct them fully, some belong to the square-sectioned ("rail") rim variety (Fig. 6: 3); others simply had a plain everted lip (Fig. 6: 5). Ornamentation when it does occur is consonant with the geographical situation of the Bayburt region roughly in the middle of the Early Trans-Caucasian province. One fragment has an impressed lozenge design (Fig. 3: 3) that forms the centre of a schematic representation of the human face, a design which fea- tures prominently at Pulur (Sakyol) XI-IX;7 while a rim sherd from R35a has a centred circle motif on the neck (Fig. 6: 4) that is quite common in the early deposits at Karaz.8 Also characteristic of these assemblages is the flat discoid lid 4Diamant and Rutter 1969. 5Kogay and Vary 1964, pls.

Bone from Q33b was dated as Beta-55338 and yielded a calibrated age range, using two sigma statistics (95% probability), between 3303 and 2615 B.c., while the R35a sample (Beta-55341) ranges from 2863 to 2330 B.C.'? The former date is comparable to that from Arslantepe VIB, some readings from Yanik Tepe and the single date from Geoy Kl, the other is more in keeping with dates from Korucutepe D." The 2nd millennium B. c. A tantalising glimpse of 2nd millennium occupation is afforded by an iso- lated hearth area of a temporary encampment in trench S34a lying immediately above bedrock. A bone sample contemporary with the hearth has offered a radiocarbon date range calibrated at the 95% (2 sigma) confidence level of 1680 to 1310 B.c.'2 The small amount of pottery is quite distinctive. One vessel has a pair of loop handles linking the rim to the neck (Fig. 4: 1). Its fabric colour is dark grey (2.5YR 2.5/0), tempered with semi-coarse limestone and quartz grit, and fired to a brownish (7.5YR 5/5) colour on both surfaces. Wheel striations on the interior reveal its method of manufacture, not evident from its burnished exterior. Another fragment, also wheelmade, is decorated with a crude squiggly incised design and vertical combing (Fig. 4: 3). In section, the piece discloses a dark grey inner core and bricky brown (5YR 5/6) edges. Both surfaces are brown-slipped (exterior 2.5YR 4/2.5; interior 2.5YR 4.5/4), with only the outside receiving a light burnishing. A high ring base (Fig. 4: 2), on the other hand, is made by hand; it is fairly heavy with grit, and has some chaff and mica inclu- sions. The outside is fired to a mottled brown (5YR 5.5/6) and beige (IOYR 6.5/3.5) colour and lightly polished, while the inside is left plain brown (5YR 5.5/6). Little more can be said at this stage about the site in the 2nd millennium other than that it was a temporary encampment as in previous periods. The Iron Age Lateral clearance at the northern end of the site has enabled us to deter- mine the limits of the imposing structure located on the crest. As the aerial pho- tograph on P1. X (a) shows, the stone foundations approximate to a true circle, and vary in diameter from 17.1 m., east-west, to 16.9 m., north-south. They consist of a circuit of rubble fill, generally firmly bedded, limited on both faces by a ring of worked stones that are well laid. Stretches of facing have been dis- placed, especially in the south-eastern quadrant, but the majority is still in posi- tion. The most interesting features to be revealed this season are two, possibly three, semi-circular bastions projecting from the outer circumference. The best- preserved, in V36b, faces south-west and measures about 6-5 m. across the base and 4 m. in depth. Another, pointing north-west, is clearly of the same size even though it thins out to a scatter. An alignment of stones at the eastern end of 'Sagona 1984, fig. 101:3.

Work in the W and X trenches disclosed the full extent of the eastern retaining wall which reached a maximum height of 12 m. (P1. X (b)). Constructed of stones of various sizes, it was buttressed and defined at the southern end, by a large cornerstone well chosen for its squareness. This area also revealed another entrance, paved and stepped, to the tower complex (P1. XII (a)). A circular structure of comparable size, but of considerably earlier date (800-700 B.c.; see below), presents itself as the closest parallel to the Biiyuktepe tower."3 It is partly preserved on the summit of Degirmentepe, in the Upper Euphrates basin of east-central Anatolia.14 Its plan reveals square but- tresses radiating from the outside circumference. The rectilinear building on the western flank was also exposed more fully. The circular pit located along the southern wall of the large room found towards the end of the 1991 season was excavated and shown to have been used for storage. Outside this large room, to the south-east, was the cooking area, stratigraphically distinguishable as an ashy black deposit. Here the bedrock was skilfully utilised and worked for the construction of built-in features such as low benches and pits. This archaeological period is characterised by at least three ware types whose distinguishing features were outlined in the last report."s Orange ware continues to be the most common fabric group. This season yielded good ex- amples of polychrome painted pottery built of orange clay. One bowl, rounded in profile, paddle-burnished on both surfaces, and orange-brown (2.5YR 5/8) in colour, is decorated with a series of horizontal bands in brown (7.5YR 4/2) and cream (7.5YR 8/4) (Fig. 4: 6). A similar decorative design was applied to an- other bowl with a more pronounced curvature and a brown burnished exterior (Fig. 4: 7). Seemingly different is a rim fragment slipped in beige (10YR 4/6) and decorated on the interior rim with what appear to be hanging triangles in a fugi- tive red paint (Fig. 4: 5). A new shape is a reddish brown (2.5YR 4/8) cup, spur- handled and grooved on the interior rim, bearing part of a painted design in orange (5YR 7/6) and brown (5YR 2.5/2) (Fig. 4: 9). Although these painted vessels have been found in secure context in association with pottery that is Late Iron Age in tradition, notably the black burnished ware,16 certain pieces, such as the bowls with horizontal bands, bear stylistic affinities with Galatian ceramics from central Anatolia.'7 The question of absolute chronology and the possibility of a carry over of the Late Iron Age cultural tradition into the Hellenistic period is dealt with below. Brown ware was represented by a vertically burnished flaring rim fragment (Fig. 4: 4), while to the black polished group can be added the sharply carinated bowl (Fig. 4: 8). The high-necked bowl in Fig. 4: 10 represents a new ware type. It is a well-fired, crisp fabric, pale orange in colour (7.5YR 6.5/6); its surfaces are self-slipped and smoothed. Typologically, it appears to be a variant of the '3This date range for the Middle Iron Age is based on Okse's 1988 study of pottery from east-central Anatolia; see Table 35. 4Esin 1981, pl. 2; Okse 1988, Plan 3.

IX (b). The Late Hellenistic/Early Roman Period The use of paving stones continued to be the hallmark of building activity in this period. Sections of pavement were found in a number of trenches, though the most coherent plan is found in the north-western sector of the site. It con- sists of two rectangular rooms each flanked on one side by a paved pathway. The foundations of the room in R37a are two stones wide (P1. XII (b)). This period is also characterised by the rubbish pits. The largest, in R35a/b, was 2.36 m. deep and had a maximum width of 1.75 m. across the bottom. Another, in Q34a, was bell-shaped. The Late Hellenistic/Early Roman pottery from Btyiiktepe found in the 1992 excavations is generally similar to that found in the two previous seasons, both in fineware and coarseware fabrics. We would again like to emphasize, however, that these comments on the material must be viewed as preliminary until a fuller study can be undertaken. The typical fineware fabric has a hard, well levigated biscuit, without inclu- sions, except occasionally for a little mica, and is an orange to brown in the core (approximately 5YR 6/6). It is sometimes fully slipped, but may be partly slipped on the exterior, with uneven application, resulting in dribble patterning. The major shapes are bowls of various sorts.20 In addition to these, several new shapes made of the typical fabric were found in 1992, including a one-handled bowl (Fig. 5: 1) with a strongly carinated profile, two horizontal grooves on the lower body, and with a dribble pattern. Also found was a large one-handled jar (Fig. 5: 2) apparently broken just above the base. The preserved handle is tri- partite in form, placed on the wall below a drip ring and above the maximum diameter. The upper part is also decorated with partial slipping. A second jug, with larger handle, narrower mouth and ridge below the lip (Fig. 5: 3) is broken before the maximum diameter, where two fine flat grooves appear, apparently intentional. A fourth very fragmentary example of the characteristic orange fab- ric is a body sherd of an open shape, fully slipped on the interior, but only par- tially slipped on the exterior and decorated with rouletting (Fig. 5: 5). The slip, thicker than what appears on most of the contemporary vessels from the site, and the fine incision of the exterior both suggest that this fragment is true Sigillata. All four of these pieces from Biiyuiktepe are wheelmade. In our previ- ous reports we have cited parallels for the shapes of the principal fineware fabric from the British excavations at Agvan Kale,21 but the same fabric and bowl shapes have come to light in unpublished excavations made in 1987 at Sos H6yiik, east of Erzurum.22 There are also a few examples of different fabrics, shapes and decoration.

Late Hellenistic/Early Roman. / 78</page><page sequence="11">EXCAVATIONS AT BUYUKTEPE HOYUK, 1992 One important sherd (Fig. 5: 8) seems to be an example of "thorn ware". It is a thin-walled wheelmade fragment, very fine, 5YR 6/8, without exterior or interior slip, and the fragment is broken at the turn to the base. The thorns are applied by hand and rather smeared onto the surface of the clay, less precisely than is usually found in this class. The vase may be a local imitation; "thorn ware" proper is believed to be from Italy. The fragment most likely dates to the later 1st century B.C. or early 1st century A.C. Although there is some slender evidence for an earlier dating in the 2nd century for a few examples, a later date for our sherd is more likely.23 One other interesting small piece (Fig. 5: 7) comes from the lip and upper wall of an open bowl with grooves inside and out. The fabric is somewhat browner than usual (7.5YR 7/4-6), with a mottled brown slip on both surfaces. On the exterior are palmettes which are stamped into the clay before firing. Most of the pottery from Biiytiktepe with decoration of palmettes or other motifs24 shows the use of impressed designs; there are very few in true relief. The shape of this example seems to be related, nevertheless, to the Megarian bowl.25 A third fragment is characteristic of the grey ware found occasionally in the Late Hellenistic/Early Roman levels. An example of this ware was illustrated in our last report26 and like that example this also is 7.5YR 6/0 in fabric, with a slip 7.5YR 4/0. The sherd must have come from a closed shape, as the interior is unslipped (Fig. 5: 6). It too is wheelmade and bears a series of horizontal ridges on the exterior, with one larger than the others. The fragment may come from either the shoulder or the lower wall; the exact orientation of the sherd cannot be determined. The last fragment of especial interest is our first example of an unguentar- ium, of a fairly rough fabric, with some mica present, 7.5YR 7/6 in colour (Fig. 5: 4). The vase is unslipped, but has on the exterior three red lines, rather unevenly applied. The interior is discoloured, perhaps due to the activity of the contents (oil?) which becomes more noticeable at the broken edge; there are additional fragments of the vase which could not be mended, as they are very warped and burnt. Because of the large size and elongated form, the original shape was probably not fusiform. Most of the coarseware also continued the types found in the previous sea- sons.27 Most common is the heavy cooking pot, with flat bottom, globular pro- file, strap handle, usually showing signs of use through secondary burning on the surface. Many seem to be wheelmade. Examples of these are illustrated in Fig. 6: 1, found on the bottom of a pit, and Fig. 6: 2, one of the three found together on a floor. Certainly the most interesting of the coarseware is the very large pithos28 found in what appeared to be a deposit of household pottery (P1. XI (a)). The clay has small to medium white and grey inclusions, very slight amount of mica, and was covered with a very thin slip inside and out. The fabric is 2.5YR 6/8, 23See Moevs 1973, 68-9. Examples of this class have been found in Greece and in Asia Minor: Jones 1950, pl. 150, nos. 617-621, where examples are dated to the 1st cen- tury A.D. 24Sagona, Pemberton and McPhee 1991, fig. 7: 6; Sagona, Pemberton and McPhee 1992, figs. 8:3; 9: 7. 25Cf.

It would appear to be an echinus bowl. If the deposit from which these vases came was not mixed, then either the date of the inscription is earlier than one would think, or else a Hellenistic shape, the echinus bowl, continued longer than one would expect. Six radiocarbon dates collected from Iron Age and Late Hellenistic/Early Roman levels and calibrated to a 95% level of confidence indicate that Biiyiiktepe was occupied some time between 910 B.C. and A.D. 322 (Fig. 7).30 Of these determinations, Beta-55335 (910-540 B.C.) is stratigraphically the least reli- able, having been collected from the top of a Late Hellenistic/Early Roman pit. On the other hand, the date bracket of 760-170 B.C. for Beta-55339, taken from a bone in a sealed locus containing only examples of Iron Age wares is quite sig- nificant in so far as the latest determination of 170 B.C. provides a reliable termi- nus ante quem for the appearance of the typical Hellenistic pottery. This brings us to the date of the tower. Three points should be noted. First, it appears that the tower complex underwent two building phases, the latest dis- tinguished by the use of paving stones in the entrance area on the eastern side. Second, a preliminary analysis of pottery associated with the tower reveals that the bulk is fabrics we have designated as Iron Age; the pieces of the characteris- tic Late Hellenistic/Early Roman wares were associated with the paved areas. Finally, the three charcoal samples collected from the summit in Trenches V, W and X have provided dates calibrated to a 95% level of confidence that range from 400 B.C. to A.D. 322, overlapping in the 2nd century B.C. Taking into account all these data and the pottery evidence, we believe that the tower was constructed some time between the 4th and early 2nd century B.C. at the tail end of the Iron Age cultural tradition and that the second phase (pavements) probably belongs to the 1st century B.c./lst century A.c. Not surprisingly, the evidence indicates that here in the highlands of north-eastern Anatolia, far removed from the centres of political power of the day, the cultural transition between the Achaemenian and Hellenistic periods was delayed more than a century.
