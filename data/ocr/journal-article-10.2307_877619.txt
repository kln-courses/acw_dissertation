<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROLAND PENROSE Picasso's Portrait of Kahnweiler WHEN I was asked by the Directors of THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE to follow on from Kenneth Clark's admirable lecture on the Mona Lisa with a lecture on a portrait painted by Picasso *, I decided to choose a painting which has caused a great deal of controversy and which marks the zenith of a movement which has been fundamental in the many re- volutionary changes that have taken place in the art of this century. The portrait of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (Fig.i) is for many reasons a unique and fascinating work. Kenneth Clark, in his introduction to his lecture said 'Some of the greatest pictures ever painted have been portraits.., .and yet the aesthetic theory of the last seventy years runs en- tirely counter to the fact of experience that a truthful like- ness to an individual can be a great work of art'. Picasso painted many portraits which were undoubtedly truthful likenesses but I have deliberately chosen one which cannot easily be qualified as a likeness to the sitter or even a likeness of the human form. It was, in fact, considered by many critics when it was painted to be an outrage to all that can be labelled serious art. This painting therefore raises many urgent questions. First of all we may ask why a young artist who had shown his ability to paint convincing lifelike portraits since his early youth should produce, with great diligence, a portrait of a close friend which bears no obvious resemblance to his model. If indeed his motive was not portraiture in the usual sense but rather an exercise in the invention of a new style, why did he choose to have a model before him all the time he was painting it and insist that it was a serious attempt to create a realistic likeness of his friend? Was he naively per- petrating a mystification, insulting tradition and viciously mocking all serious belief in art? These were, in fact the motives that have frequently been attributed not only to this work but to the greater part of Picasso's production. What I wish to consider is what in Picasso's career led up to this painting and whether it should be thought of as the beginning of a new conception of portraiture or as a brilliant attempt which failed. Pablo Picasso, as we know, began life with a most unusual talent for expressing himself in drawing and painting. Encouraged by his father, who was himself a competent though uninspired painter (a badly paid art master who im- posed on his son strictly academic rules), young Pablo took to painting as naturally as a bird learns to fly. Already, when he arrived in Paris in I900 at the age of nineteen, he had outgrown all that art schools could teach him. He rapidly found the atmosphere he needed, not only among experi- enced painters and sculptors but also among poets such as Max Jacob, Alfred Jarry, Andr6 Salmon, Pierre Reverdy, Maurice Raynal and Guillaume Apollinaire. The early years were not easy. He lived in great poverty but his personality, his eager searching black eyes and his talent found a response in collectors such as Gertrude Stein and her brothers who had settled in Paris, and from dealers. Within six years of his first arrival he had risen from a con- dition close to starvation to being the centre of a tumultuous group of artists and poets in Montmartre who came to be known as 'La Bande Picasso' and to the position of a young painter recognized for the emotional power of his work. Pictures of these years known as the 'Blue Period' are now in high demand. They were followed by the even more seductive paintings of the 'Rose Period'. The climacteric period began, however, in I906. It centered, surprisingly, first around a portrait. Picasso had become intrigued by the originality of Gertrude Stein and appreciated her enthusiasm for avant garde activities. She had recently bought Cezanne's portrait of his wife and it was in her salon in the rue de Fleurus that he met many of the elite in the world of art and literature. Among her friends also were Matisse, Derain, Gris and Braque. Visits were returned by Gertrude and her brothers, Leo and Allan to Picasso in his bohemian quarters in the Montmartre studios known as the Bateau Lavoir (see Fig. I2). With his ability to draw a likeness with incredible speed, Picasso made many drawings of his friends, often choosing those like Leo Stein whose long legs, gold-rimmed spectacles and bushy black beard made him easy prey for caricature. The Steins were among the first to buy Blue Period paintings. They were fascinated by the talent of Picasso just as they were captivated by his manner and the fire in the blackness of his eyes. Leo had made a collection of rare books of which he was particularly proud but told Picasso that he could not trust him to look at them because he felt sure his eyes would burn holes through the pages. It came as a surprise, however, to Gertrude that she should be asked by Picasso to sit for her portrait since it was then well known that he had found the actual presence of a model no longer necessary. The circus folk, his favourite subjects at that time, lived nearby, but were never asked to come and pose for him in his studio. But on this occasion, reverting to his earlier more conventional habits, Picasso made heavy demands on his sitter. Gertrude Stein claims that she sat more than eighty times for her portrait. She describes her ordeal thus: 'Picasso sat very tight on his chair and very close to his canvas, and on a very small palette which was of uniform brown grey colour, mixed some more brown grey and the painting began'.1 To relieve the monotony, Picasso's mistress, Fernande of the beautiful almond-shaped eyes, read aloud stories from La Fontaine. Gertrude was only able to account for his unexpected demands and persistence by presuming that there was a mystic attraction binding together Spaniards and Americans. As the weeks went by the likeness that appeared on the canvas pleased her but it slowly became apparent that it did not satisfy Picasso. Something was going wrong and 'all of a sudden' she tells us, 'one day Picasso painted out the whole head. "I can't see you any longer when I look", he said irritably. And so the picture was left like that' and he left for Spain. His journey this time lasted all summer. On his * Roland Penrose's lecture was delivered on I6th January 1974 in the Lecture Theatre at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and is here published without change-Ed. 1 [G.

Toklas, London. 124</page><page sequence="2">PICASSO'S PORTRAIT OF KAHNWEILER return, without seeing his model he painted in the head and presented the picture to Miss Stein. She accepted it graciously, but from others came severe criticism. They were shocked, they said, by the masklike severity of the face - to which Picasso replied with a cryptic remark, that has since become justified: 'Everybody thinks she is not at all like her portrait, but, never mind, in the end she will manage to look just like it'. Indeed, as it now hangs in the Metro- politan Museum in New York it is recognized by all as the most authentic portrait of that inventive and ebullient poet Gertrude Stein (Fig.3). There are several points in this story that are significant. The first is the doubt that grew in Picasso's attitude towards his own work. He endorsed instinctively Max Jacob's statement, 'Doubt, that is art', and owed his proverbial youthfulness throughout his life to the continuous question- ing that he exerted on himself and his work. With this in mind it is not surprising that he should have scrubbed out an unsatisfying likeness, but it is astonishing that after months abroad and without another glimpse of his sitter, his imagination and his visual memory should have been sufficient to allow him to paint a likeness so convincing- ly from memory. We have ample proof that throughout his life Picasso en- joyed making portraits of his friends. In his early youth Pablo had been recognised as the family portrait painter. There are remarkably competent and expressive portraits of his parents, made when he was fourteen years old, and many excellent paintings and pastels of his aunt, his sister and friends of the family. But it is also evident that he found great interest in studying his own appearance. In in- numerable drawings he proved that he was able to see himself not only full face but in profile. There are self- portraits in which he took pleasure in caricaturing himself among his friends or seeing himself dressed up in strange disguises, even as Pharoah, although the most prevalent and significant was that of Harlequin (see Fig.2). This desire to walk around himself and see himself from all points of view is obviously at the root of later discoveries in Cubism. By this time many changes had taken place and self-portraits became rare. When the romantic symbol of Harlequin in his diamond coat of many colours reappeared we find it in- corporated into his work in a more abstract cubist form. There is a dramatic self-portrait as early as 19oi in which we are given an expressive view of the privations he was suffering during his first year in Paris. By I90o6 the early years of extreme poverty had changed to a more prosperous life, as may be seen from another self-portrait painted at about the same time as Gertrude Stein and with the same formal severity. His paintings were now selling well, not only to the Steins but also to buyers abroad such as the great Russian collector Shchukin. The work of this period has qualities of classical perfection which make it seductive to all. Alfred Barr claims that these paintings 'have an unpretentious, natural nobility of order and gesture which makes the official guardians of the "Greek" tradition such as Ingres and Puvis de Chavannes seem vulgar and pallid.' The optimism of the 'Rose Period' continued to show itself in paintings made during the following summer at Gosol, a village high in the Spanish Pyrenees. But before this visit began Picasso had been deeply impressed by some newly discovered pre-Roman Iberian bronzes (4oo-2oo B.c.) which had been shown in the Louvre. As he passed through Barcelona he was again conscious of the strength of the Romanesque and the Gothic art of Catalonia and also his admiration of El Greco was rekindled. These influences first appeared in the final version of the portrait of Gertrude Stein and in the self-portrait painted on his return to Paris. Soon after, they were to burst out in that revolutionary painting which caused a great crisis in Picasso's life and in the history of contemporary art, Les Demoiselles d'Avignon, painted in the winter and early spring of i906-07. In the autumn he had produced a series of nudes that show how his delight in classical charm had been dramati- cally sacrificed to a desire to represent forms with convincing solidity. He had emphasised their sculptural qualities to a point which was almost grotesque. These nudes showed a dissatisfaction with the past and a desire to discover new visions of reality. But again, doubt made him take abruptly a new direction. He adopted a style in which the forms were flattened, when he began to paint Les Demoiselles. This painting which is now recognised as an event of major importance in the history of contemporary art is often called the first cubist painting and although it lacks that characteristic geometric stylisation which was to earn that movement its superficial title, it contains other basic cubist conceptions which are fundamentally more important. Without entering into a discourse on Les Demoiselles which has been liberally and very competently reviewed by many art historians, I would like to mention three characteristics which are relevant to the subject of this lecture. The first is the multiple view-point implied in the lower figure on the right of the painting. It is portrayed from in front and behind as though we were moving around it. The second is more basic in its implications. It is the fact that we are no longer presented with an imitation of what we consider to be reality but with an object, or rather the representation of objects on a flat surface which we are asked to consider in their own right rather than as a reminder of a something 'de[j vu'. Picasso had introduced into painting the conception of an object as something that we KNOW, instead of something we have only seen from a fixed point of view, limited in time and space. It can therefore claim to be an object, known and understood as we know objects in daily life which are subject to the element of time - objects which can move or which we can move around. Finally, there is a third factor: the influence of tribal art, chiefly from Africa. The recent discovery by a few painters, including Matisse and Derain, that there were powerful qualities both emotional and aesthetic, in objects that had formerly been dismissed as barbaric, was also welcomed by Picasso. Their first impulse was to enjoy them for their bizarre appearance. Picasso however saw, particularly in African sculpture, an attitude towards art and reality which since the Renaissance had faded out of European art. He realised that its power was due, not to an attempt to imitate nature but to a creation of a new magical reality of its own. The idea came to him when Les Demoiselleswas welladvanced. The influence of Iberian sculpture is clearly visible in the eyes and faces of the three nude figures on the left of the painting, and he ruthlessly introduced his new conception of 125</page><page sequence="3">PICASSO' S PORTRAIT OF KAHNWEILER reality in the two figures on the right. The outcry of horror when Picasso showed the picture to his friends was probably the most dramatic event in all his life.., .a life punctuated by the frequent scandals that his naturally rebellious spirit never ceased to provoke. Among the very few who were not outraged or sad that such a promising young painter should have gone mad was a young German who had settled in Paris as an art dealer ... Daniel- Henry Kahnweiler. He had recently become a friend of Picasso and was not only an admirer of his extraordinary talent but showed he was undeniably convinced by offering him his services as a dealer. While Braque and Matisse looked at the new work, bewildered, Derain said sadly, 'one day we shall find Pablo has hanged himself behind his great canvas' and Leo Stein gave his verdict as 'Godalmighty Rubbish'. But Kahn- weiler saw in it the birth of a new conception of art. Picasso's forfeiture of his hard-won reputation was of no importance beside the internal struggle he went through as he realised 'that he could no longer be an artist who accepts without a challenge the dictates of his muse' said Apolli- naire who was also a witness. The poet later discussed this drama in his book The Cubist Painters, stressing the difference between artists whose 'works do not pass through their intellect' and those who 'must draw everything from within themselves'. He added 'Never has there been so fantastic a spectacle as the metamorphosis he [Picasso] underwent in becoming an artist of the second kind.' A self-portrait of 1907 reveals the change to a more intro- spective mood. In its deformations which emphasise the main features and simplify the structure of the head, it has affinities with the tribal masks of Africa. With much enthusiasm and very good judgement, Kahnweiler gave all the encouragement he could to Picasso and also to Braque, who rapidly recovered from the initial shock and saw the possibility of using this new conception of art as a means for the creation of a new style. The paintings he had made in the summer of 1908 were too revolutionary for the Salon d'Automne and were refused. But Kahn- weiler had the courage and foresight to exhibit Braque's paintings in his gallery in the rue Vignon. From then until the outbreak of war in 1914 he was to be a close companion of both Picasso and Braque in those ycars of passionate dis- covering which challenged all conventional ideas of art and established Cubism as a style or rather as an attitude to our consciousness of the world around us. These early paintings of Braque showed very clearly the influence of Cezanne in their colour and their simplification of form which was based on Cizanne's belief that nature should be treated by an analysis of its basic forms, the cy- linder, the sphere and the cone, contained in a framework of linear perspective. It was the geometric shapes dominating the landscape that attracted the attention of the critic Vaucelles and suggested to him that 'Cubism' should be the name of the new style. By a strange coincidence, that same year Picasso returned from his summer spent north of Paris at La Rue des Bois with canvases that showed the same tendencies and in which the influence of Cezanne was also apparent. However it was in the following year that the cubist style began to crystallise. With Fernande, Picasso had returned to the farm of his old friend Paillares at Horta de Ebro (or more correctly Horta de San Juan). It was an atmosphere that had pleased Picasso during his first visit ten years before and he enjoyed the clear skies and sharp contrasts in the landscape. The well-cultivated plain with the compact angular shapes of villages and the arid crags of the mountains coincided with his love for the light and the drama of Spain. There during the summer he painted many landscapes, single figures and heads, including a portrait of Paillares (Fig.5). This work is important because of its stylistic re- semblance to a portrait he had painted earlier in the same year of a friendly dealer in Paris, Clovis Sagot (Fig.4), and the influence of Cezanne that can be seen in both. In the portrait of Paillares, however, the colour is reduced almost to monochrome and it is the construction of the surface of the head with bold geometric simplications which is em- phasized. It is, I think, worth recalling that, thanks to the enthusiasm of Roger Fry, the Portrait of Sagot was shown in London in the first Post-Impressionist exhibition, during the winter of I910-11. It was greeted with scorn and angry protest. A series of paintings (Fig.6) which were based on Fer- nande, although she did not actually sit for them, are of in- terest for us in this study of the progress of portraiture in Cubism, which led to its climax in the Portrait of Kahnweiler. The analysis of the shape of the head and body has become in- creasingly structural and definite. Its surfaces are construc- ted by facets organized so that they meet and present a surface which is closely related to the background. In other ways, particularly in their colour, the paintings contain frequent references to Cezanne. Throughout, figures and landscapes received the same treatment. Returning to Paris, Picasso went to the studio of his friend, the sculptor Gonzalez. There he modelled a woman's head which was clearly a three-dimensional version of the recent paintings of Fernande. It is an early example of the closeness between painting and sculpture characteristic throughout the work of Picasso. For him painting and sculpture were virtually interchangeable, as we can judge from a conversa- tion with Gonzalez in which Picasso said that in the early cubist paintings, 'It would have sufficed to cut them up ... and then to assemble them according to the indications given by the colour in order to be confronted with a sculpture'. More recently, explaining his intentions in making this head, he told me, 'I thought at one moment that the curves you see on the surface should continue into the interior. I had the idea of making them in wire'. But feeling that this analy- sis in depth was becoming too much of an intellectual exer- cise, he decided on this compromise in which the head retained its solidarity and volume while the surface is broken into facets closely resembling the simplified shapes he had used in the paintings of Fernande. By the winter of 19o9-10, Braque and Picasso had evolved a very definite and personal style to which Juan Gris gave the name 'Analytical Cubism'. As they progressed it became increasingly complex so that for the layman it was difficult to relate it to the subject-matter from which it was derived. Both artists saw the danger of it becoming an abstract aesthetic exercise which would have been contrary to their intention of penetrating deeper into the reality of the world around them. 126</page><page sequence="4">2.

A well-known instance of this is to be found in the method he used in painting The Girl with the Mandoline in I9Io with Fanny Tellier as his model. She returned time after time to pose for him until her patience gave out and she announced that she was indisposed. 'I realised', Picasso told me, 'that she meant not to come back and consequently I decided that I must leave the painting unfinished. But, who knows?' he added, 'it may be just as well I left it as it is'. It is significant that he abandoned the painting as soon as his model left him. But there was another means of remaining in contact with reality which Braque never attempted: the portrait. In the spring of 191o Picasso painted three portraits for each of which he demanded the patient participation of his model. In each case he picked on friends who were devoted to him, and, because they were all dealers, had a special interest in his work. There is a painting of the winter of 1909 known as the portrait of Braque but Picasso denied that it should be taken seriously as a portrait. The first important work of this period was the portrait of Ambroise Vollard. He was the first dealer in Paris to promote the painting of CGzanne and gave Picasso an exhibition as early as 1901. The sittings began during the winter of 19o9-1o in the well-lit studio to which Picasso had moved recently in the Boulevard de Clichy. The result was, in this case, a compromise between imitation of nature and the cubist version of reality, for al- though the principle of keeping a continuous screen of facets in monochrome close to the picture planewasobserved, the head itself was detached from the background by a local flesh colour. A comparison with a contemporary photo of Vollard can prove that the painting achieved its purpose of being remarkably realistic, recording not only an excellent likeness but also the circumstances - the heat of the stove and the length of the sittings - that caused the otherwise vivacious dealer to spend most of the time asleep. Vollard himself tells us that although many people failed at the time to recognize him, the four-year-old son of a friend said without hesitation on seeing the painting for the first time: 'That's Monsieur Vollard' (Fig.7). Wilhelm Uhde, the sitter for the second portrait, which was painted the following spring, was a German intellectual, who, like Kahnweiler, had been attracted to Paris by the progressive ideas that throve there. In character he was austere and reserved. This is eloquently conveyed by the consistency of the subdued tones of grey maintained through- out with no concessions to the colour of flesh. Here, there is an even more complete merging of the figure into the back- ground, which is filled, appropriately, with a chimneypiece and books. The treatment throughout is admirably fitting. It expresses convincingly the dry, loyal personality of Picas- so's scholarly friend, with his conventional style in clothes and his perceptive wide-awake eyes (Fig.8). As can be seen from a contemporary photo, the likeness is extremely faithful; so much so that more than twenty years later, although I had never met Monsieur Uhde and knew only the portrait, I was able to recognise him sitting in a crowded cafe (Fig.9). Having pursued to this point his cubist interpretation of the reality of his sitters, Picasso left Paris, accompanied by Fernande and Andre Derain to spend the summer of 1910 in the small Catalan port of Cadaques at the invitation of his friend Ram6n Pichot. Here, he continued to organise the analysis of form in his painting with even greater severity. According to Kahnweiler, who followed eagerly the de- velopment, it was during this summer that he arrived at the summit of Analytical Cubism. But he returned to Paris with a large number of unfinished canvases, still doubting and dissatisfied. It was the portrait of his life-long friend Kahnweiler on which he then began to work. We can see clearly what had happened at Cadaques if we compare it with the portrait of Uhde. In the earlier painting he is still concerned with arrangements of the surface, whereas now he treats the sitter as a three-dimensional structure, composed of disrupted elements plotted in space like a transparent honeycomb, viewed from many different angles and yet welded together into a comprehensive whole. To quote Kahnweiler, 'he had taken a great step - he had pierced the closed form'. Let us now turn our attention to the portrait itself (Fig. I). As he had done before with his former sitters, Picasso de- manded the presence of Kahnweiler for some thirty sittings and set to work directly on the canvas without making any preliminary drawings. Again he accepted the existing background of his studio with objects lying around in disorder and an unconventional collection of pictures, drawings, musical instruments, draperies and tribal objects hung on the walls. In the portrait it is possible to decipher, on the left, one of a pair of wooden statues from New Cale- donia that he had acquired two years before (see Fig.I2), and below it a group of medicine bottles which Kahnweiler remembers him keeping always beside him. On the right of the canvas, prominently in view, is a large staple driven into the top of a picture. The figure itself is seated and slightly displaced from the centre of the canvas to leave room for its companion, the New Caledonian statue. The head of the figure is on a level with Kahnweiler and facing towards him, but it is impossible to detach it entirely from the intricate pattern of the background. The group of bottles on the table below is more legible and has a resemblance to a landscape of houses at Horta, called the 'Reservoir', painted only a year before. The tight grouping, the geometric shapes and the composition are all similar but in the landscape certain clues, such as doors and the reflection of the houses in the water give it a much larger scale. In spite of the similarity of method, there can be no confusion. The colour of the portrait, typical of paintings of this period, is subdued, almost monochrome, but the variations between brown, ochre and colder grey are far from meaning- less. They subtly accentuate changes in the inclination of the planes in a way that is reminiscent of Ctzanne. Although the contrasts are often strong, no black and no white is used. In spite of the difficulty we may experience in under- standing Picasso's analysis of his sitter we have the impression of the presence of a human form seen from the head to the hands clasped together at the bottom of the painting. Above them are other recognisable features such as a watch chain and higher up an opening in the jacket that shows a striped shirt, stiff collar and a tie. These we recognize as signs or clues which, put together, allow us to see the painting 129</page><page sequence="7">PICASSO' S PORTRAIT OF KAHNWEILER as a portrait of Kahnweiler in his best suit rather than an aesthetic exercise in abstraction. Naturally it is Kahnweiler's head that dominates and again, when set beside a photo of Kahnweiler, we discover as by a miracle that a mysterious likeness has been achieved, although it is impossible to discover any feature that corre- sponds literally with the photographic imitation of nature. The eyes which, in the case of Uhde are easily recognisable, are crystalline constructions. The nose emphasised on the left with deep shadow meets a cylindrical shape rounded off by shading which terminates abruptly in an area lighter in tone and geometric in shape which links with forehead, chin and the far side of the face so as to frame the essential features, eyes, nose and mouth, while the head is crowned with curved lines indicating hair (Cf. Figs.Io, I1). Such a description, however, is sadly inadequate. It suggests that the structure is weak and arbitrary whereas in reality we are presented with an architecture in which each facet is constructed with conviction and a noble sense of proportion. As we examine each detail there is never a moment of uncertainty as to how the structure holds to- gether. It is this assurance that prompted Picasso to say 'In the paintings of Raphael, it is not possible to measure the exact distance from nose to mouth: I want to paint pictures in which this can be done'. In order to make this possible he had denied himself any reference to the illusory depths of linear perspective and covered the whole canvas with facets close to the picture plane, joining them together without anywhere leaving a hole. Head and background are united in the same shallow plane and dovetail continuously into each other. In spite of the convincing presence of anthropomorphic architecture there are deliberate ambiguities and often plurality of statement. This is to be found in the detail of the mouth which is drawn with two disconnected lines at different levels and completed by a curve and a vertical division. As a result of these surprisingly sparse indications we perceive a closed mouth spread across the face and strange- ly alive in its expression. The body, from the shoulders to the hands, is again com- posed of planes which can be taken to protrude or retreat without finally destroying the total mass and allowing us the delight of letting the eye wander in and out of its successive crystalline passages. The organisation of the surface forms a pattern that recalls the intricate honeycomb design of the Moorish vaulting in the Alhambra. Here, although it floats in the vertical plane of the picture, it is like ripples on the sur- face of water. The imagination is stimulated to find in it scenes which though they are ambiguous appear undoubted- ly to exist. It is excited by the rhythmic life of this new reality and devises with delight its own interpretation. The passages round the neck and shoulders can seem like a promenade among streets and houses, glowing with light and clearly defined in their spacial relations to each other, though we imagine them to be one inch in depth or a hundred yards. This new sense of reality, detached from representation, creates a new world of poetic associations. Again to quote Kahnweiler: 'The finished product is in the mind of the spectator'. It is the creation of this phantasmagoria which has caused Edward Fry to say, when discussing the portrait of Vollard from which somewhat the same sensations can be obtained: 'The real subject, however, is not Vollard but the formal language used by the artist to create a highly structured aesthetic object.' This could be true if we reverse the por- trait and enjoy it in the same way upside down. We shall find that Kahnweiler is dissolved into dramatic effects resembling the prisons of Piranesi. But that was not, I believe, Picasso's intention. He never became interested in abstraction for its own sake. Analytical Cubism, his most hermetic period, was still for him a search for reality. Considering always that he was above all a realist and that the subject of this painting was Kahnweiler, there is no doubt that he succeeded, in a most triumphantly daring way, in establishing a likeness which is a composite of human characteristics and an organization of form which is both illusive and matter of fact, just as is life itself. There is a question which follows which I find difficult to answer. Why, after the invention and realisation of a master- piece such as this do we find no more cubist portraits? It is true that both Braque and Picasso were at this time in doubt about how much further they could continue in a style that, even when applied to portraits, was becoming increasingly hermetic. In their search for links with reality they turned, in the Synthetic Cubism that followed, to collage and the use of words and signs. But these methods were more ap- propriate in still life. In Analytical Cubism the link was in peril of dissolving into abstraction. In consequence, this form of expression was modified by Picasso. There seems to be a parallel here with the reason he gave me for making the cubist Head of a woman in bronze rather than in wire. In this form it would have become excessively intellectual. For although Picasso was extremely well read and brilliantly intelligent he lived more intensely by his emotions than his intellect. It was this that diverted him from experiments that could lead away from an integration of art and life. There has been speculation about the degree to which mathematics and a consciousness of the theories of modern atomic physics entered into Cubism. The idea that Picasso and Braque actually used mathematical calculations and applied them with geometric instruments is completely false but the knowledge that, according to the physicists, solid objects are composed almost entirely of empty space had undoubtedly some influence in prompting Picasso to analyse, in his own way, the reality of these objects and to relate apparently solid matter to empty space. This en- deavour is to be found from the cubist period throughout his work. The painting, when it left Picasso's studio became the property of Kahnweiler and would have remained with him as a treasured possession had it not happened that at the end of the I914-I8 war all his property was sequestered by the French Government because of his German nationality. In the auction that followed the portrait was bought by a Swedish painter, Grunewald, who paid no more than 2,000 francs (say ?Ioo). Later it went to America and was added to the collection of Mrs Charles Goodspeed who later became Mrs Gilbert Chapman on her second marriage. Mrs Chapman, who is herself a skilled painter, made an extremely faithful copy of the portrait before giving it to the Art Institute of Chicago where it may now be seen. 130</page><page sequence="8">io.

However, the ending of portraiture in the analytical cubist style did not mean that Picasso lost his desire to make portraits. There followed innumerable examples of portraits of his friends which are completely representational. A convincing example is to be found in a drawing and a series of three lithographs which he made of Kahnweiler in one day, 3rd June 1952. Here the influence of Cubism is absent as in most of the drawings he made of his friends, but this is not true of his paintings, in particular those of the women he loved and his own children. In the portraits of Dora Maar, the emotional content frequently removes all but a slight resemblance to his model and it was rare for him to paint her or his wife, Jacqueline, from life. But if we examine the portrait of Picasso's daughter, Mala, of 1937 we can find many references to Cubism, such as the two eyes and two nostrils placed on the same profile, implying movement in the subject or in the spectator and creating a contrast with the fixed stare of the doll she is holding (Fig. 13). There are even more obvious associations in The Woman Weeping, of 1937, which can in some ways be con- sidered as a portrait of Dora Maar. Here the simplification of form undoubtedly has its origin in Cubism. These are, however, only vestiges of the total dissection and reorgani- sation of form found in cubist portraits and nothing in the work of Picasso in portraiture after 190o can claim to be the successor of the portrait of Kahnweiler. One significant subsequent development should not be for- gotten. During the transition from Analytical to Synthetic Cubism in 19 II, Picasso fell in love with a girl named Marcelle Humbert, whom he called Eva, and although there is no portrait, not even a drawing to show us her beauty, through his eyes, Picasso wrote to Kahnweiler on I2th June 191 I telling his discerning and reliable friend Heine: '... I love her very much and shall write her name on my pictures.' The name Eva which appears in some paintings became synonymous with 'Ma .7olie' taken from a popular song of the time and her presence in his heart rather than in his eye was inscribed, like a lover's token on the bark of a tree, in several cubist paintings, a subterfuge for outright portraiture. In trying to sum up the intrinsic value of this extra- ordinary work I find that apart from the fascination of its aesthetic value, the classical equilibrium of its composition in depth and the harmony in its subdued colours, it is the realisation of a new vision of reality that interests me most. Andre Breton described the necessity for grasping this vision in his prose-poem Le Chdteau Etoile.2 After discussing paranoic interpretations of forms in the clouds or in stains on old walls, he wrote: 'There is there a source of profound communication between people which we have only to free from all that masks and troubles it. Objects in reality do not exist in the way they appear to. From a consideration of the lines on which the most ordinary among them is composed springs forth, without the effort of one wink of the eye, a remarkable 'image-devinette' [a riddle-image] that is inseparable from it and which establishes for us, with no possible error, the only real object, present and for us desirable'. It is the evocation of this 'riddle-image' by Picasso with its probe into reality, its widespread implications and its poetic power that makes the Portrait of Kahnweiler a unique and extraordinary work of genius. 2 ANDRi BRETON: L'Amour Fou, Paris [1937].</page><page sequence="10">-*, I- ..... . . . ?::". ? - : ,?.!- .?::??, -::???:??
