<plain_text><page sequence="1">The "Visual Arts" and the Problem ofArt Historical Description By David Summers n the introduction to Art and Illusion, E. H. Gombrich provides a brief history of the close relation he finds to exist be- tween perceptual psychology and specula- tion on the history of artistic styles. Theo- ries previous to the one he wishes to ad- vance, he argues, were ultimately based on the reduction of visual perception to elements of sight and touch, on Bishop Berkeley's arguments that we see only col- or and that our apprehension of space is based on our association of visual "ideas" with movement and with the possibility and past experience of touch. This notion led, through nineteenth-century psychol- ogy, to the writings on art of Konrad Fied- ler and Adolf von Hildebrand, finally to yield Bernard Berenson's "tactile values," Heinrich Wolfflin's linear-painterly polar- ity, and the haptic-optic polarity of Alois Riegl.1 In the first part of this essay I wish to examine the assumption that works of art are models of perception. As Gombrich's brief history suggests, this idea has been fundamental to modern art historical meth- od and may be said to form the spine of the language art historians use to talk about works of art "in themselves." I shall argue that when we analyze works of art from the standpoint provided by this assumption the language we are using is not neutral but, rather, implicitly interpretive. More specif- ically, we are imposing upon works of art either what I would call an abstract optical naturalism or a corollary expressionism. This language consequently shapes our in- vestigations from the outset. The perceptual psychologism with which we shall be concerned finds a deep uncon- scious corroboration in the very term "vi- sual arts," present in the titles of any num- ber of modern texts and textbooks on art. Although "visual" might be taken simply to distinguish painting, sculpture, and ar- chitecture from music, poetry, and the dance, more is implied by the term than mere classification, since classification is made on the basis of what are presumably essential characteristics shared by the arts grouped together. These characteristics are definite and familiar. The arts of painting, sculpture, and architecture are "visual" because they can be analyzed into (and described in terms of) elements of vision. These are "forms," the list of which may vary, but which are sufficiently well repre- sented by Panofsky's "color, lines and volumes."2 When we say these arts are "visual," again, we do not mean simply that they can be described in terms of "forms," or visual elements, but that they are properly described in such terms. Text- books begin from these elements as if from an alphabet in order to teach people to "see" the "visual arts." An artist in this analysis is conceived of as a combiner of visual elements. Combinations may be constructive, that is, made up within the definitions and implicit rules of the ele- ments themselves, or expressive, that is, determined by the inwardness of the artist. Construction yields certain configurations, expression yields certain configurations, and in cases where configurations are more or less given (that is, in cases in which a theme must be treated) the artist in com- bining forms adjusts them to the theme. In such cases, "expression" or "quality" are to be sought in "formal" relationships to which theme, as merely the occasion to make relationships, is secondary and com- pared to which it is relatively unimportant. In the case of great art, the expressive value of formal configurations may rise to a kind of unity with the theme (Michelan- gelo combines formal elements in such a way that they may come to "mean" the creation of Adam; or the jagged forms of Guernica may be said to "express"-- rather than illustrate-the violence of its theme). I repeat these familiar ideas be- cause we shall soon consider them in a different form. The idea of the "visual arts" is finally based on the simple assumption that the works of art that fall under this classifica- tion are visible all at once. The visual arts are thus also "pictorial," and painting best exemplifies the relation of work of art and viewer implied by the term. But the idea that paintings are visible all at once is itself historical and no doubt had its beginnings at the same time as optical naturalism. If painting shows what is visible all at once, then it follows that paintings themselves are visible all at once. Such an understand- ing of painting became explicit with per- spective, which brought virtual three-di- mensional order-and thus two-dimen- sional order-into relation to a fixed point of view in real space. It may be noted too that, at the same time as perspective was defined, painting was reduced to elements -planes, outlines, light, dark, and color -that were in fact perceptual elements.3 It was Leonardo da Vinci who wrote of paint- ings in which things are visible "simulta- neously, at one glance, just as things in nature,"4 and it was Leonardo who con- tributed the invention of chiaroscuro---that is, a kind of composition consciously based upon the visual elements of light and dark -to the foundations of modern painting. A definite relationship of painting and per- ception was thus some 300 years old, firmly established in the precepts and practices of tonal painting, when, in the eighteenth cen- tury, painting began to be defined as an art of space and simultaneity in opposition to its old partner, poetry, an art of time and sequentiality. Lessing wrote in familiar arguments that painting employs in its imitations Winter 1982 301</page><page sequence="2">quite different media or signs from poetry, the former employing shapes and colours in space, the latter artic- ulate tones in time; if it is unques- tionable that the signs must have a convenient relation to the thing sig- nified, then co-existing signs can only express objects which co-exist or whose parts co-exist, and succes- sive signs can only express objects which are successive, and whose parts are successive. Objects which co-exist or whose parts co-exist are called bodies. Consequently bodies with their visible qualities are the proper objects of painting. Objects which are in succession or whose parts are in succession are called actions. Consequently actions are the proper objects of poetry.5 Lessing is, of course, assuming that paint- ing is figurative and that the space of which he speaks is virtual. His definition of paint- ing as instantaneous and therefore both spatial (almost negatively, in the sense of being non-sequential) and perception-like had the immediate consequence of pre- scribing treatment of subject matter in light of the nature of the medium of paint- ing. But it was the appeal to visual percep- tion implicit in his definition that was to prove the more important principle. It was Lessing himself who gave us the idea of die bildenden Kiinste,6 and it was the suc- ceeding definition of painting (or of the visual arts) not just in formal terms but in terms of perceptual elements that contrib- uted both to abstraction and to theories of pure visibility, and, ultimately, to the con- ception of the history of art as a "history of vision."'7 That conception brings us round full circle, leading back to the question of the art historical language we use. Once painting became identified with the physical act of vision and, as a result of this identification, was reduced to light and dark (in tonal painting) or color (in painting after Impressionism), the ques- tion of the organization of these elements immediately came to be viewed in a new way. At the most fundamental level, any painting was a continuum of light made visible as such by any possible configura- tion of contrasting values or colors, just as a mirror in light may be regarded as a set of points of light before it is viewed as a surface that reflects one thing or another.8 At first, perspective seemed to provide an order coextensive with what had now be- come a field of light, dark, and color. Light is the condition of actual vision, and perspective-at least in principle-is de- fined by the geometry governing the real relation between the eye and objects in light. But both of these apparently physical determinants of pictorial structure entailed point of view, and this point of view be- came metaphorical as soon as it became literal, or-to put it another way-painting became subjective at the same time as it became objective. Subject matter, natural or conventional (that is, determined by appearances or by tradition), also provided a principle of pic- torial organization. But this second "ob- jective" factor was also immediately com- promised by the new importance of inven- tion, which arose at the same time as natu- ralism itself. Invention brought fantasy or imagination into play in such a way that both space and subject matter were shaped by artistic "vision," or "creation." In- vention is closely related to composition, which became a conscious principle of or- ganization at the same time as invention came to be valued. Composition may be defined as the determination of what "looks right" in terms of what pleases the sense of sight. Composition is the arena of taste and judgment; it is a consciously aesthetic or- der. Invention (or fantasy) and composi- tion are major components of personal style; therefore, conscious concern with personal style was a necessary concomitant of naturalism. The determinants of structure in optical naturalism thus all line up as irreducibly subjective, and I now offer the conclusion and hypothesis that follow. In the tradition of tonal painting defined in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, that is, in the tra- dition of modem optical naturalism, the principles of structure are all subjective (or psychological). Thus, any structure may be regarded as organizing traces of inward- ness over a presumed continuum of light. All structure above the level of light/dark contrast (and even specific configurations of this contrast) thus become "expression," so that optical naturalism may be said to have provided the basis for an idealist art history. Any image becomes a representa- tion of the world. At first that analysis yielded merely personal "visions"; but the systematic comparison and grouping of works-the transition from the physiog- nomic reading of artistic character in works to modem art history-led to the identifi- cation of structural uniformities among members of groups of works that rippled concentrically away from personal "style" or "vision" to collective "styles" or "vi- sions" or "wills" or "intentions." And regardless of the degree of abstraction in the works, the language used to describe them-owing to the more or less implicit understanding of art as "visual"-is al- ways and necessarily psychological.9 The idea that any painting is a visual continuum is thus specific to our culture and is---or became-a convention signifi- cant in a determinate way to a certain group of people. The convention was significant in that it defined any image as something that could be seen as if it were a physical event. But the very foundation of this con- vention in the analysis of vision meant that in itself the continuum identified with pure vision was semantically neutral, since it underlay any possible image (or configu- ration). This, in turn, means that the per- ceptual psychologism we are examining entails a highly determinate relationship between what we see and what it means. In his theoretical introduction to iconog- raphy and iconology, Panofsky rejects the idea of pure vision, arguing that we only see as we also recognize and interpret. Although we may see our friend tipping his hat as "color, lines and volumes," we "automatically" identify this configuration as an "object (gentleman)" and its change as "an event." At this point the perception is already meaningful, and in fact this meaning has the status of the factual. It is only at this level that the "objects and events" may be "expressional," when, through "empathy," we understand the movement as "indifferent, friendly or hostile."'1 Later, Panofsky summarizes by distinguishing between three strata of meaning, "the lowest of which is com- monly confused with form, and the second of which is the special province of iconog- raphy as opposed to iconology."" When he formulates a synoptic table of his argu- ment, Panofsky begins with primary or natural subject matter, which is either fac- tual or expressional and is interpreted by pre-iconographic description and "pseudo- formal analysis." Such interpretation is rooted in "practical experience"; its "cor- rective principle of interpretation [is the] history of style," defined as "insight into the manner in which, under varying histori- cal conditions, objects and events were ex- pressed by forms." "Objects and events" may thus be taken as the necessary first interpretation of form, which cannot be separated from meaning. 12 Although Panofsky is suspicious of pure form, he is still willing to construct his argument upon a base of "color, lines and volumes." This means that works may be reduced to such units, which are by impli- cation strictly analogous to the elements of visual perception. The implied equivalence of perception and art becomes explicit in Panofsky's direct transferal of his analysis "from everyday life to work of art." The work of art is thus utterly transparent-it is meaning made manifest in just the same way as meaning is immediately manifest in the real world. Although Panofsky's argument seems to build up from perception through the various stages of interpretation to iconolo- gy, it actually develops from the top down. The "synthetic intuition" that iconology demands takes up the data provided by iconographic analysis and considers "the influence of theological, philosophical or political ideas; the purposes and inclina- tions of individual artists and patrons; the correlation between intelligible concepts 302 Art Journal</page><page sequence="3">and the visible form which they assume in each specific case."13 It is at this level of interpretation that the intrinsic content of a work of art must become evident if it is to become evident at all. Presumably, all other content is "extrinsic," related not to the work itself but to individual experience and conventional meanings, and it is on the iconological level that the "true" sig- nificance and (although Panofsky does not say this) the quality of the work must lie. It is thus on the iconological level that the work is realized as a transcendent synthesis of historical factors and that its full human significance is to be understood. The "intrinsic" content of the work and (since for Panofsky, content is all) the na- ture of the work is the opposite of the "formal." The "formal," which, as we have seen is closely identified with the perceptual, is insignificant; it is the "mat- ter" to which content gives form, and it "means" only that meaning must be visible as a physical event. Iconology only con- cerns itself, and should only concern itself, with the way in which content is illustrated in individual historical circumstances. The incidental nature of the visual as such in this scheme must be stressed; all in all the theory of iconography and iconology is based upon what may again be described as the semantic neutralization of the actual visual character of the work. 14 A lthough there are certainly reasons for an allegorical figure of Veracity to be holding a peach, the appearance of such a figure must be considered arbitrary in several ways. Someone initially decided to make a figure of Veracity, and even though the allegory may be based on some presumed consonance between the nature of veracity and the nature of peaches, it is still the case that a lady holding a peach might not be Veracity, or that Veracity might be shown holding something other than a peach. The pairing of lady and peach must be explained; either we must have seen other images of ladies with peaches which we have come to know are figures of Veracity or we must be told that this image is a figure of Veracity. (We are, of course, assisted by the fact that we are more or less accustomed to the practice of allegory and prepared to think that such a pairing of images may mean more than is apparent. Thus, we may be pointed towards a solution by the very inscrutability of the image.) Such a manner of stating meaning -both the manner in general and the spe- cific meaning of the allegory-must be regarded as conventional in the fullest sense of the term. Panofsky writes that, just as a female figure with a peach in her hand is a person- ification of Veracity, so "a group of figures seated at a dinner table in a certain arrange- ment and in certain poses represents the Last Supper, or that two figures fighting each other in a certain manner represent the Combat of Vice and Virtue.'" It is just happenstance, in other words, that in one tradition of imagery we recognize certain figures and configurations as "carriers of a secondary or conventional meaning."'15 The Last Supper could have had any con- figuration consistent with the representation of the narrative and it would have had the same significance. That, in turn, means- to take one salient and familiar element of many Last Suppers-that the bilateral sym- metry of these images is not integral to their significance. In the rest of this essay I shall consider the alternative proposition: that planar structure in fact absolutely establishes and qualifies images and is a major condition of making visible their meaning. I shall use the example of bilateral symmetry to open the way to a consideration of a basis for the significance of planar structure dif- ferent from that provided by the assumption that the work of art is a model of perception. It will be argued that, in images in which planar structure is a primary concern,16 it is, on the one hand, neither arbitrary nor conventional, or on the other, is it simply to be explained as "expressive" ("static," "balanced," or "harmonious" in the case of symmetry), although it may have aes- thetic values. To develop this thesis we must first examine more closely the rela- tion of the formal basis of optical natural- ism to meaning. E. H. Gombrich has written that the idea of a painting as a window, as a "slice of reality," makes the whole surface of a painting "significant" in that every mark or area represents something. "The empty patch thus easily comes to signify light, air, and atmosphere, and the vague form is interpreted as enveloped by air." This continuum of significant marks and areas can "evoke the image in us" of, say, a horse, or trees. 17 Meyer Schapiro uses a similar example in discussing the more general principle that "distinctive for the picture-sign . . . is the pervasiveness of the semantic function," that the "picture- sign seems to be through and through mi- metic."'8 By this he means that, although the parts of an image (patches of modeling, for example) may be unintelligible in iso- lation, they function seamlessly and uni- formly in the image as a whole and that all parts of the image function in the same way on this level. In Impressionist paint- ing, however, Schapiro finds that "fairly large elements have acquired a non-mi- metic aspect." Since a large space is shown on a small area, the strokes both are sum- mary and summarize a great quantity of visual information. In such painting, Scha- piro argues, something like verbal signs is approximated in that the sign (a few flecks of paint) is relatively arbitrary and its meaning is determined by context. Still, he concludes, "no basic change has taken place here in the semantic relation of image to object," because all of these marks still correspond to something, to "sensations . . . induced contrast colors and effects of illumination." In illustrating his argument, Schapiro uses various examples of what elsewhere in his article he calls "geometric-optical" art, paintings and engravings in which the meaning of isolatable elements is deter- mined by context. The ambivalence of any isolated mark in such art may perhaps better be understood less as a characteristic of all signs than as a necessary characteristic of signs in such a system. The implications of Schapiro's observation that parts of Im- pressionist paintings have "acquired a non- mimetic aspect" may lead to the following conclusion: the ambivalence of the ele- ments he describes is rooted in the absolute possibility of value or color contrast (or whatever devices create such contrast) to represent whatever is visible. This ambiv- alence is, in other words, a necessary result of the analysis of vision that makes optical naturalism possible. The primary unit of such painting is, therefore, the mark that effects contrast in the presumed visual field; only secondarily does it become the mark that resembles. We may rephrase this conclusion in the terms of our own argument by saying that in the tradition of painting beginning with the Renaissance, every mark or area represents the same thing, namely light, articulated as contrast of either value or color, and that all representation must occur by means of those contrasts. Thus, the "pervasiveness of semantic function" might be identified with a purely optical univocality of ele- ments. This is by no means the only possi- bility, however. It should be noted that the identification of meaning within purely vi- sual elements repeats the conclusion of the examination of the idea of the visual arts in the first part of this paper. With Schapiro's general principle of the "pervasiveness of semantic function" of the constituents of works of art in view, let us begin to consider an alternative proposition. e begin with the upper register of the so-called Tlalocan from Tepan- titla in the Valley of Mexico (Fig. 1)19 and ask whether it is meaningful to reduce this image to the same elements we have just discussed in our imaginary Impressionist painting. First, the actual elements are not the same. The "marks" of the Impression- ist painting are indistinguishable from their autographic facture. In the Tlalocan, the possibility of such significance is sup- pressed in favor of uniform shapes of color defined by uniform outline. It is possible to abstract from the actual facture of both images and thus to reduce them to alterna- tive configurations of formal elements. To do so, however, implies a similar base in a uniform visual field and in a similarly uni- Winter 1982 303</page><page sequence="4">form semantic function. Such a procedure allows access to the actual character of the Impressionist painting and even recapitu- lates it technically, as a system of contrast- ing hues and values on a bright ground. But whereas this procedure of analysis cor- responds to the Impressionist painting and points to some of its animating historical filiations, it obscures the nature of the Tlalocan and conceals its relation to func- tion and context. If a small section of the outlines of the figures in the Tlalocan were to be isolated, would we then be looking at elements of the image? Such a detail of the image, although it would certainly have expressive value and could tell us something about style, would not make the major function of line in the image evident. Line is not simply a formal device, a way of organizing a visual field in an expressive way; rather it is outline, it is of something, and it can only be treated in its relation to an image when it is treated as defining. The elements of an outlined image are thus discrete and at least potentially identifiable.20 These ele- ments, which identify definition with the plane, are therefore signs. In the Tlalocan, then, the functional elements of the image are hands, eyes, symbols, bands, flowers -all the subimages of which the whole image is made up. It follows that the image cannot be abstracted to a presumed level of semantic neutrality, to the level demanded by optical naturalism. Although the meaning of signs is depen- dent upon their relation to other signs, they are not unintelligible outside this relation. That is, they do not simply stand for con- trast or become mere marks outside this relation. The diamonds that form the eyes of the large central deity in the Tlalocan may, if isolated from the rest of the image, not be evident as eyes; they would still evidently be fire symbols, however, and in fact they add to the image as a whole the significance of fire-eyes. A stroke of tinted cobalt blue that represents a distant moun- tain, on the other hand, makes no sense at all outside its place on the surface of a painting. Its meaning does not double when it is put in its place, rather its specific semantic neutrality ends.21 Such a stroke may of course be significant as recogniz- ably painted, but as such it has no relation to a distant mountain. We may now make a distinction between context and order. A context is a condition of mutually sustaining elements, mutually sustaining not only visually but seman- tically; it is in a sufficient context that a mark becomes a significant element of an image, significant in the simple sense that it evidently represents something. An order is the determinate arrangement of signs. Only modern scholarship has produced dictionaries of the signs of the art of Teoti- huacan. These signs actually occurred only in specific instances and in real relations; 01s"U . ... . ... .. As wit . . . . . . . . . . . .. .. .. . . ..... . .... Mpg- m_ ,11 jx HIS gig!

Mexico City, National Museum of Anthropology. but those relations do not constitute merely a context because they are not visually determined and because they have semantic value over and above their correspondence or apparent correspondence to a certain visible state of affairs. The diamond fire- eyes of the god figure in the Tlalocan were given specific significance by their sym- metry, their relation to anthropomorphic order, and their hierarchical relation to other signs in the image. It is not possible to understand the way in which these rela- tions are significant if it is assumed that they are "expressive" configurations over an optical base. In the Tlalocan, differentiation is made by uniform line, which distinguishes inside and outside with a decisiveness of the ab- solute character of axial divisions. Color difference is a corroboration of this linear distinction rather than a fundamental mode of differentiation. Thus, we may say that differentiation can be accomplished in two ways: by contrast of color or value and by distinction by uniform line. Contrast pre- supposes a principle of optical unity, dis- tinction does not. Distinction creates an entity/not-entity opposition between what is defined by line and what is not. (This is not a figure-ground opposition, which im- plicitly virtualizes the relation and presup- poses the idea of the image as a "view".) This is, of course, not to say that the Tlalocan lacks unity, but rather that its unity is of a radically different kind. By formulating an alternative definition of the "image-field," a definition that more clear- ly separates it from its optical base, we may be able to provide a solid base for Schapiro's argument that the order of such images as the Tlalocan "is built on an intuitive sense of the vital values of space, as experienced in the real world."22 304 Art Journal</page><page sequence="5">he condition for the statement of the relation of symmetry is a flat surface treated as a plane. We shall now consider some issues raised by the fact-of which Schapiro has reminded us at the beginning of the article already cited several times- that planes did not always exist and that therefore the "image-field" we take so much for granted was not always avail- able.23 Although the animals of Palaeolithic painting may imply planarity in their profile presentation and in the univocality of the statement of their parts, they are not defined by planarity in the same way as images are defined by planarity in Neolithic art. More important, the kind of symmetrical and serial organization dependent upon opera- tions presupposing planarity, the opera- tions of translation and rotation, are rare in Palaeolithic art and, when they do appear, lack the rigorous organization that true pla- narity makes possible. If planes were realized historically and are not, therefore, a given form of our imaginative apparatus (which they have become), then the further possibility must be considered that the plane does not simply reflect some interior reality but conditions interior experience-as is evident in its results-making it articulable and devel- opable in certain specific ways. Thus, the plane becomes a basis for what Schapiro calls the "non-mimetic elements of the image-sign." We may take the example of so-called conceptual images, which typi- cally are planar. The planarity of these images should not be taken to mean that the concepts or definitions of things they embody are flat, but rather that a univocal- ity of semantic value of parts most like a concept or definition is to be found only in the plane. Similarly, the identity of two things can be stated in the plane, but again, in specific ways: by rotation or translation, that is, by operations that in themselves involve the statement of identity in a whole complex of possible significant transforma- tions. The historical realization of planes (as opposed to their being a projection of interior reality) means that it was human art that created the possibility of imagining and developing planar relations; in fact, planar order became the basis for the typical forms of civilized life, from city plans and roads to written language. The plane af- forded inexhaustible possibilities of definite relations and is, perhaps, the deepest sign of human order. The development of planar order was intimately bound up with the making of smooth surfaces that could be understood as notional planes; for example, symmetry as a clear relation developed at the same time as the building of walls.24 The associa- tion of planarity with real planes is of the greatest importance. A mathematical plane is nowhere, of any extent, and can have any orientation. A real plane is somewhere, of definite size, and is usually upright or horizontal. Any plane faces; any real plane faces in a way that is determined by patterns of human use. This means that an upright wall-to take a common example-before any image is identified with it, is deeply anthropomorphic. It already faces, and may be said just as it stands to be a kind of basal mirror. This mirror-like all mirrors -is not just passive, however. As wall and viewer face, the planarity of the wall makes it possible for the viewer to under- stand himself to possess the kind of order that is articulable only in terms of the plane, of its characteristic divisions and opera- tions. The cardinality of the viewer, his back- and frontness, is stated by the facing of the plane; his ups- and downness is stated by the uprightness of the wall and by its possible vertical division; and his sym- metry (this is, as we shall see, a deeper category than left and rightness) is stated by both facing and vertical division.25 Again, when an image is identified with the wall, it already has these significances before it is an image of one thing or another, and whatever image it becomes must take up these significances as part of its own meaning. Moreover, these significances are felt and provide the basis for a decorum that is seldom transgressed in images in which planar structure holds. It may be said of conceptual order in general that its purpose is to state relations of hierarchy. The definition of conceptual images by the conditions of planarity means both that such order possesses a clarity strictly related to the univocality of signs making up the image and that this same order is based in the real space of the viewer as shared with the image (what I have called the cardinality of the viewer). As an image, the upper register of the Tlalocan is, as present as is the wall upon which it is painted, and, within the limita- tions of its being two-dimensional, is thus comparable in its presence to sculpture.26 Facture is significant for the image, distin- guishing the wall and therefore the space upon which the image faces. Facture is evident not only in the smoothness of the wall, but also in the skilled making of the image and in its elaboration as ornament. Ornamentation is continuous in semantic function with the symbols (or powers) with which it is also continuous in artificial development. Both ornamentation and symbol are intended to complete and em- power the image as a whole; thus, the highest degree of ornamentation distin- guishes the central figure in the upper reg- ister. All this suggests that the image is inseparable from its context and, more specifically, from its format; definite extent is necessary in order for the operations of division, rotation, and translation essential to its conceptual order to be performed with the results we see. These operations presuppose the understanding of the wall surface as a notional plane; it is in fact with the level of reality of the plane as such that the image is identified and from which it takes certain values before it is an image of one or another deity or ceremony. Bilateral symmetry is effected by the rotation of a shape through 180 degrees.27 That is to say that the definition of bilateral symmetry presupposes a plane as the begin- ning and end of the operation producing it and implies a vertical division of that plane relative to which rotation occurs. This axis may be defined either before the operation or by the operation. Bilateral symmetry states the identity of corresponding shapes, and no distinction can be made between rotated shapes. If we imagine a circle A to be rotated, it is not possible to say that one or another of the two resulting circles is prior; we cannot even say that one is A and the other A'. The situation is thus perfectly reversible, and one A is equal to another. While it states identity, however, bilateral symmetry also states radical difference, diametric opposition. This can be illustrated by the example of left and right. In the case of diametric opposition identity becomes relatively generic, since only the compara- ble can be contrasted. It is necessary to understand the hands as similar in order to oppose them as left and right. Night and day must be understood as diurnal time before they can be opposed. Symmetry makes such relations possible-and possi- bly visible-simultaneously. The signifi- cance of symmetry as the basis of the order of images works within the bounds pro- vided by these definitions; this meaning becomes unstatable when symmetry and its supporting planarity are abandoned. In the upper register of the Tlalocan the large central deity is distinguished not only by ornamentation but also by a number of relations either evident in the plane or developed from it. Relative size is most clearly evident in the plane, and greater size further states the relation of this image to others. Elevation on the plane also states relative "height," and does so with the same direct relation to the real space of the viewer as elevation upon a throne. Devel- opment of planar order begins with vertical division, stated by the axis about which the image is symmetrical. The axis has a mul- tiple semantic value as well as a formal value. The identification of the largest, highest, and most ornate figure with this axis adds the further distinguishing values of centrality, uniqueness, independence, and unity to the meaning stated by its pre- sentation. The great androgynous deity is shown frontally as the upper half of a figure, a headdress over a face with fire- symbol eyes, from the mouth of which water streams, as it also streams from the hands at either side. The lower part of the figure is an altar-mountain (a temple plat- form?) at the base of which is a cave. Considered as a whole "figure," the head- dress, head, and arms, and the altar-moun- Winter 1982 305</page><page sequence="6">tain have the same truncated proportions as the typical figures of the ritual art of Teotihuacan, exemplified by the priests to either side. Not only does the axis com- manding the order of this central figure command the order of the register as a whole, but the axis as it defines the figure functions as principle. From this metaphor- ical center issue not only the streams of water from the mouth of the figure but also the streams from the cave below, which is made up of singing conches and filled with marine animals. The same center, in the highest part of the image, guides the twin- ing of the interlaced cosmic tree. In this image (as in the human body considered in terms of planar order), identification with the central axis is visible in the union of two halves to make one most telling frontal whole. The condition of the centrality and uniqueness of the figures is thus also the same as the condition of its frontality, which in turn signifies its relative whole- ness. Wholeness, of course, is rooted in the univocality of signs fundamental to conceptual images, in the equal statement of all the defining parts of a thing shown. Here the anthropomorphic order of head and hands is stated with maximal clarity and completeness. Given the multiple semantic values of the axis, subordination to the central figure could have been stated simply by the rota- tion of any figure relative to the same axis. But the subordination of the flanking fig- ures is insisted upon in ways similar to those that make evident the superior posi- tion of the central figure. The flanking figures are less ornate, smaller, and more distant from the center while they are also double and shown in profile. Strict profile presentation is, of course, determined by the plane, and might be described in rela- tion to frontality as the least difference consistent with the coordinate logic of the plane. But it is also difference from unity, dependence upon the center that states unity, relative halfness rather than whole- ness. Profile presentation thus states rela- tive lack of worth or power, always, of course, in an order strictly defined by the central image. The flanking priest figures, each with a large headdress that shows the opposite side of the headdress of the image it faces, wear costumes, that though complex, are exactly alike. As necessitated by rotation, however, one holds the implement in his right hand and the other holds it in his left, and one sprinkles seed with his right hand while the other does so with his left. If the image represents a ritual, then the associa- tion of one or another hand with one or another significant action would appear not to have mattered, which is unlikely. It is more probable that symmetry was more important than description, that is, that description was subordinated to the identi- fication of an image of ritual with the tran- . . ....... .

London, British Museum. scendental character of the plane. This is evident in the simple rotation of the priest figures, with the significance of identity rather than opposition. It is not even clear from their presentation that the two flanking figures are not one and the same. In any case, precisely because the maker (or mak- ers) and users must have been right- or left-handed and left and right may have been conventionally significant for them, such absolute symmetry maximizes the dif- ference between image and viewer in the viewer's own space.28 Bilateral symmetry is thus a means by which images are relatively distinguished and subordinated.29 Relative to a central image, bilateral symmetry states difference from unity. Difference, as we have just seen, may be stated in many other ways: by the opposition of profile and full face, for example. In fact, such differentiation from the central figure is necessary in order for symmetry to work. If we imagine two frontal figures rotated with respect to the axis of an identical figure, the result is a trinity. The figure is both different and identical to itself, and this identity, in its presentation related to unity, is closely re- lated to the significance of unity. We may now consider the relief from Nimrud showing king Ashurnasir- pal II worshiping the sacred palm (Fig. 2) in accordance with symmetrical formula already ancient when the image was made. The king is shown twice, on either side of the sacred palm. The palm, shown frontally and symmetrically, occupies the lower three-quarters of the central vertical axis relative to which the whole image is or- dered. The upper quarter of this axis is occupied by an image of the god Ashur, a winged circle, which, like the tree below, is frontal and symmetrical and within which a small profile is shown. According to the standard inscription of Ashurnasirpal II, Ashur is his lord, and the king is the god's priest. The king and his assistant span the relief vertically, so that their bearded heads and crowns are on about the same level as the winged disc. The subordinate relation of king and assistant to god and palm is stated by the rotation of the former relative to the axis of the latter. The symmetry of the figure of the king is not the result of simple rotation (over and above the inconsequential fact that the images are slightly different in size). From the waist down the shapes of the robed bodies are more or less identical, differing only in trim. Above the waist the matter becomes more complex; the general shape of the trunk is repeated, but, whereas in the lower part of the body both figures have their near leg drawn back, in the upper part of the body the near arm is raised by one figure of the king and the far arm is raised by the other. The hands of these near and far arms, one shown outside and one shown inside, both point to the god Ashur. The other hand of each figure holds a tasseled sceptre; in one figure the near arm holds the sceptre and is clutched to the waist, supported by a fold of the robe, as if by a sling, while in the second figure the far arm holds the sceptre and is extended straight downward, slightly forward of the trunk. The heads of the figures are practi- cally identical, or, more precisely, they are diametrically opposed rotations of the same profile. Not only is the general shape of the king rotated about the axis stated by the palm, but this rotation is translated to the winged figure standing behind him. These winged figures step forward and raise their arms with gestures that echo the gesture of the king. The rotation of the king in this relief is usually described as "ornamental," like a kind ofjawab, and in fact the image exploits symmetry of a decorative degree of purity. To say that it is ornamental, however, con- signs the whole configuration of the image 306 Art Journal</page><page sequence="7">,i_-- -ii~ .., :. i_ : :: :_ -:: -i-i_ :-i :: ii:ii: :-;-: ?... :::-;::_:_:: :: -:_ ---:: . a :- --''--: ::':':' ::: :?::: ::: : :: .... :: : : :_:::::--:-:--:_:? :: :----- : i-i -::i--iii iii i-i:i -iiliii:i --ii iiii~iiii iiiii'~iiinii"iiniiii-i:i-ii-i:.iiiiiiii -i-i ::: :::,::: ::.:: _ ; - 1? -i-i-i -. -: hi: ?- 1-- :" : :: : ::::::::: : : ill: s~sB~-_~l~i ~ ~p&amp;i~ ~; :s-?: ::::_::iil:-;~ r --1 Il ?----~~s iilii-l r-.' :*::_::: ~PF- I I i r ~~aa~aru~u Ir rr :-:: P I: 1 I ii L? -*x: i I _~ - r i: -iiiiiiiii~i~i~ii iiiii :i-: : !i :i:-iiiii-----_-:i-ii:ii:"i~:~~:i~:~~~;: I i ~u ----?1 -- , - ?- :r-?:i:::: ::i::i: r -i ---i- iiii iii: iii- i----ii:-: i:- :: iiiaiiirii:i -_i-: B i--Ag?-- : - i: ---:''-i:ii-i:~i-i--?::- --'i::' ---:--:-:-----: i:: :: _-i-i~:::: -- :: : :i` I ~-:~8~1~s%':~s~- _7 I'"Qs~W~4~~- :~ ;;~-pf ~j i -e ~ ir ?i I i- Fig. 3 Hubert and Jan van Eyck, The Ghent Altarpiece, interior, 1432, oil on oak panel, 375 x 517 cm. Ghent, St. Bavo. -both symmetry and departures from symmetry for the sake of "variety"--to meaninglessness. If the tree and the symbol of the god Ashur were shown with a single image of the king, their frontality would make them whole relative to his profile. Were that the case, however, their uniqueness would be compromised by dissociation from an axis that, more than determining their own symmetry, determines the symmetry of the whole image and is thus central to it. As it stands, with symmetrical figures flanking the divine symbols on either side, the multiple significances of tree and sym- bol are stated as a kind of litany which is really, once again, no more than the mean- ings of the axis in its various planar rela- tions to the image. Centrality, priority, uniqueness, wholeness, independence- all define the principle to which the king is subject with the irreducible clarity of their planar structure. If centrality contributes to the meaning of the images of the divine symbols, it raises problems for the image of the king. If he is shown once and is not in the center, he must, like any other element in a sym- metrical construction, be shown twice. The possibility that the identity of the images might be merely generic (they might both be kings, as Peter and Paul in symmetrical relations on either side of the Virgin are both saints before they are individuated) is denied by the unmistakable reflection of the image of the one king. There is only one king at a time, and the identity implied by the rotation of his image must mean that he is identical with himself. The presenta- tion of the image in this way thus means that, although the king is not equal to the central image to which he stands in hom- age, no one is equal to him. The order of the entire image depends upon the visibility of the relation resulting from the operation of rotation. At the same time, as we have seen, within this general similarity, only the lower part of the king and his head are exactly rotated; the trunk of the body is shown with the near arm of one figure and the far arm of the other per- forming the same gesture. Thus, not only are the figures similar as to shape, but also in both versions the king is shown making the same gesture with his right hand. The image does not simply reflect, so that right becomes left, as it did in the Tlalocan; rather, rightness and leftness are preserved in the rotation, and it is-at least in the up- per half of the image-as if the king were meeting himself making the same gesture. In this manner, Ashurnasirpal's similarity to himself is made into a concrete identity: the two profile heads may be taken together as the whole head of the one historical king who is seen in all his wholeness. So that Ashurnasirpal, the living king, is shown as whole and incomparable, but under condi- tions that clearly separate him from the privileged frontality of the divine image. The uniqueness of god and of king are stated in different ways that are both a repetition of ancient convention and, at a deeper level, a development of the significant planar structure underlying the convention.30 We shall conclude with a considera- tion of the inside of the Ghent Altar- piece by Hubert and Jan van Eyck (Fig. 3). The examples of bilateral symmetry we have just examined are, of course, histori- cally unrelated, having been made more than a thousand years apart in different hemispheres. The similarities and related differences in significance that I have ar- gued are apparent in their formal configura- tions arise not from contact but from the Winter 1982 307</page><page sequence="8">possible semantic structure inherent in pla- narity. Similarly, the Ghent Altarpiece does not so much show the "survival of medieval conventions" (although it may also do that) as it reflects the purpose (also evident in medieval art) of making the image truly present in the space upon which it faces and, by that very fact, making it at once transcendent and effective in the space of the viewer. In the Ghent Altarpiece virtu- ality is an issue, which it was not in either of the preceding examples. The altarpiece as a whole is constructed on two parallel virtual coordinate planes, folding inward from the baseline of each register. Only Adam and Eve are excluded from the virtual plane of the upper register; instead, they are shown on planes that tip downward out of sight and appear as they would to the viewer if they stood in niches at the height of the base of the upper register of the altarpiece. But although the figures in the Ghent Altarpiece are now meticulously tex- tured volumes set on virtual planes, it is still overwhelmingly the planar order with which we have been concerned that gives structure to the image. The God figure in the upper register is shown frontally-in maesta, the Italian Renaissance phrase for such frontal figures--elevated and espe- cially distinguished by-ornament and attri- butes. The Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist are shown in three-quarter view as relatively less whole, both turned to the central figure. As rotation of much the same shape (and form) within identical formats, they are generically identical (they are at least something like "most sacred persons") before they are Mary and St. John the Baptist. (In terms of his presenta- tion in the plane, St. John the Baptist is exactly what his inscription calls him: "greater than man, equal to the angels.") The upper register of the altarpiece is thus significantly symmetrical, but this symme- try is also significant as opposition, clearly evident in relations of left and right. God raises his right hand, Mary is to his right, which establishes her superiority to her "equal" on God's left, St. John the Baptist. Similarly, Adam is on God's right, Eve on his left. Thus the two parents are equal in that they may be recognized as comparable, but distinction is also made between them as male and female, or perhaps, if the image is "read" sequentially, as first and second created.3' Since, however, opposi- tion is a special case of symmetry, it is not necessary to suppose that any relation other than equality was meant to exist between the two groups of musical angels. f we now compare the inside of the Ghent Altarpiece as a whole to the Tlalocan as a whole, more significant sim- ilarities emerge on the level of planar struc- ture. We can follow the same axis relative to which the God figure is frontal and the upper register is symmetrical through the crown at his feet, to the dove of the Holy Spirit, to the Lamb, to the Fountain of Life in the bottom foreground. If the same pro- cedure is followed with the Tlalocan, the axis defines the cosmic tree, the great deity in the upper register, the frontal rain-god mask (with flanking profile masks) in the band separating the two registers, and the water-mountain in the middle of the scene below (perhaps a paradise, in which little foreshortened figures, interspersed with flowers and butterflies, disport themselves and sing). In both works, the axis provides continuity between the two registers and we follow the axis upwards to higher and higher realities. In both images there is a substantial rupture between upper and lower registers, most conspicuous as a dif- ference in the size and scale of the figures. This rupture is, once again, more than a formal device; in both cases it makes plain a vertical distinction between a transcen- dental image in real space and relatively narrative and historical images in virtual space. In the lower images we encounter pictorial structure based upon surface and virtuality. Such pictorial structure demands its own explanation, outside the limits of this paper. If the planar structure of the images we have just examined is obvious, we must ask ourselves what that must mean. Why is the art of the world, in Gombrich's phrase, "a vast ocean of 'conceptual' art,"32 broken only by a few islands of naturalism? Be- yond that, why does planar structure con- tinue to figure even in naturalistic styles? Images governed by planar order are often described as "conventional." What seems to be meant by that is that the images are not "matched" against appearances of things to which they correspond, or that they are not original," or that they betray a conservatism, a desire to repeat the same image. By implication, planar order is con- ventional in the sense of being utterly arbi- trary, maintained only by usage. While it is true that images in which planar structure predominates are religious or political or both in many cases, that patronage cannot in itself explain why such structure should occur in so many far-flung instances, why it remains a perennial possibility for the human imagination. In this essay I have tried to account for the pervasiveness of planar structure by arguing that the identifi- cation of images with the plane is signifi- cant in itself in ways that suit these images to the uses to which they are put. I have also argued, in the first part of the paper, that our habits of thinking about "form" have made it difficult if not impossible for us to approach such images, to understand their purposes and animating historical principles. This is true not only for non- Western art, for archaic or medieval art, but also for Masaccio's Trinity, for the Disputa or the School ofAthens, even-to use Panofsky's example once again-for the Last Supper. Notes 1 E. H. Gombrich, Art and Illusion: A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, Princeton, 1960, p. 16; G. Berkeley, Towards a New Theory of Vision, 41-51. Such speculation by no means began with Berkeley; it should be traced forward from the fusion of Aristotelian psychology and Arab optics in the late Middle Ages, which centered on questions of the visual perception of magnitude, the relation of vision to the common sense, and the nature of the common sense. Berenson (as cited by Gombrich) wrote that "the painter can accomplish his task only by giving tac- tile values to retinal impressions." In Aesthetics and History (Garden City, 1948, pp. 69-73), Berenson, citing Bergson, wrote that to most of us the purely visual object (which he calls "utilitarian") is a "signal, cipher or blur." The painter completes this phan- tasm, turning blur to shape to form, giving it "tactile value." Art is thus visual perception completed, basically according to the pattern set out by Berkeley, although, for Berkeley of course, all spatial judgment would have involved such completion. (In The Ital- ian Painters of the Renaissance, Cleve- land and New York, 1962, p. 63, Berenson writes that "every time our eyes recognize reality, we are, as a matter of fact, giving tactile values to retinal impressions," so that the painter must "do consciously what we all do unconsciously." Why such artistically completed perception is also aestheti- cally completed-unless the argument was written against "incomplete" painting, like Impressionism-is not clear to me.) For Berenson, the ability to perform the completion-and per- fection--of visual perception is none- theless "beyond common cognizance" and it is the achievement of artists. Riegl and Wolfflin used their categories of the tactile and the visual more "sci- entifically," although it may be noted that, even though they do not rank art on the basis of its attainment of "tactile values," touch is still associated with classical styles. Kant (Critique ofJudg- ment, 14, trans. J.H. Bernard, New York, p. 59) wrote, "in all the formative arts . . . insofar as they are beautiful arts . . . delineation is the essential thing .... The colors which light up the sketch belong to the charm; they may indeed enliven the object for sen- sation, but they cannot make it worthy of contemplation and beautiful." If psychology forced a choice between 308 Art Journal</page><page sequence="9">the purely visual and the tactile in visual perception, then the tactile was neces- sarily associated with the "essential S. . the worthy of contemplation and the beautiful," since line had tradition- ally been linked with substance (because of its association with the multivalent notion of form) and color with accident. "Scientific" art criticism was by no means free of such deep value judg- ments. At the other end of the scale, the art school near-proverb that "there are no lines in nature" is an implicit rejec- tion of the tactile and its values in favor of the purely visual. 2 E. Panofsky, Meaning in the Visual Arts: Papers in and on Art History, Garden City, 1955, p. 26. 3 L. B. Alberti, On Painting and On Sculpture, ed. C. Grayson, London, 1972. Book I of De pictura is devoted not only to perspective but also to the elements of the visible as they concern the painter. Color is defined by Aristotle (De anima, 418a27-419a) as the special object of sight, and light as the possi- bility of the visibility of color. The "visual arts" correspond to the "arts of design." (See P. O. Kristeller, "The Modern System of the Arts," Renais- sance Thought II, New York, 1965, pp. 182-83.) The transformation from one to the other could be described as the progressive perceptual psychologiza- tion of an artistic procedure, which was itself explained in psychological terms. 4 Leonardo da Vinci, Treatise on Paint- ing, ed. A.P. McMahon, Princeton, 1956, 35; see also 33, 37, and 42. The argument is repeated many times in his paragone notes. E. H. Gombrich (Means and Ends: Reflections on the History of Fresco Painting, London, 1976) dis- cusses Leonardo's demand that walls of stacked fresco paintings be brought into relation to a single viewpoint. 5 G. E. Lessing, Laokoon, xvi. I have quoted the translation of B. Bosanquet, A History of Aesthetic, New York, 1957, p. 224. 6 L. Venturi, History of Art Criticism, New York, 1964, p. 154. 7 The phrase of course is Heinrich Wolf- flin's (Principles of Art History: The Problem of the Development of Style in Later Art, n.p., n.d., p. 11). See L. Venturi, History of Art Criticism, chap- ter XI on "Art Criticism and Pure Visi- bility." Venturi (p. 266) considers the art of Cezanne to have been misread in such a way as to have contributed to the development of the "taste of the ab- straction of form," which he thinks to be the same as the "theory of pure visi- bility." This theory he calls a "phe- nomenology of vision,"' and he calls its elements (e.g., line, color, composi- tion) "symbols." Wolfflin is called "the leading discoverer of the symbols of pure visibility," the symbols being his five categories. "Because they are abstract in form," Venturi writes (p. 270), "symbols belong to psychology and do not have a judgment value . . . just because line and color are two symbols and not art itself, they have the same value, and any preference is arbi- trary and depends on individual taste rather than reason. Any symbol can occur in both masterpieces and poor works." 8 When Alberti began his treatise on painting with the definition of a point as a "sign," further defining a sign as the smallest thing that can be seen on a plane, and stated the general principle that the painter strives to represent "only those things that are seen in light" (On Painting, pp. 36-37), he located painting in the realm of the physical. Consistent with this, his fa- mous piau grassa Minerva (in the ver- nacular version of the text) is nothing more than the adaptation to the problem at hand of the commonly repeated Aris- totelian distinction between physical and speculative mathematics (Physics, 194a). When he defined the parts of painting (On Painting, pp. 66-67), Alberti only slightly reworded his first principle: "Since painting strives to represent things seen, let us take note in what way things are seen. First ... we see that to be something which occupies a place. The painter will draw around the space of this place, and this will be called circumscription." "Place" in this context seems again to owe to the Physics, to Aristotle's definition of place. Place is associated with local motion (21 la13, 212b8) and is defined as follows: "because it circumscribes things, place appears to be a form; the extremities of the circumscribing and of the circumscribed body coincide, and both form and place are limits. Yet form and place do not limit the same thing; form is the limit of the thing circumscribed, place is the limit of the circumscribing (21 lb l0ff). Like all of Aristotle's scientific ideas, his idea of place was subjected to lively scrutiny. On the criticism of Aristotle's notion of place and its attendant notion of the absolute nature and value of directions, see M. Jammer, Concepts of Space: The History of Theories of Space in Physics, Cambridge, Mass., 1965, pp. 53-94. William of Ockham defined place as surface, and, rejecting the idea that it was either substance or quality, identified it with quantity. See H. Shapiro, Motion, Time and Place according to William Ockham, St. Bo- naventure, N.Y., 1957, pp. 114-15. Seen in these terms, Alberti is dis- cussing surface in terms continuous with his treatment of space, three-di- mensional bodies, and proportion. Al- berti's perspective construction defines a "place" in which figures and objects in turn occupy "places," and the place of any figure or object is defined by its outer boundary and the inner boundary of its container. Line may be said to stand to these boundaries as it stands to optical rays, which are describable as lines-and are therefore describable mathematically-but are not really lines. The painter's line thus stands for boundary and is necessary to describe place. It is clear, however, that the passage of plane surfaces modified by light into virtual space is what line signi- fies. Lines, Alberti writes, should be so subtly made as almost to escape being seen. If line is too apparent, it will not seem to be the edge of surfaces of things in the painting, it will rather seem like a crack (On Painting, pp. 66-67). Such a definition of the role of line does not mean that line must be eliminated from painting, rather it precisely defines the problem of making drawing compatible with a fully realized virtual dimension. It does mean that light and dark (which make relief) is a deeper principle than contour. It could be suggested that Ren- aissance disegno developed within the bounds of this definition. 9 W. Worringer (Abstraction and Empa- thy: A Contribution to the Psychology of Style, Cleveland and New York, 1967, p. 51) provides an instructive example of such inference. Since orna- ment is by and large "conventional" rather than "expressive," it tends to be little valued in modem discussion. Pre- cisely those corporate and impersonal qualities that have made ornament un- interesting to those concerned with per- sonal expression have made it keenly interesting to those concerned with col- lective "expression." Its very corporate nature makes ornament a collective composition and therefore, inevitably, a collective "world-view." This comes about inevitably because the "compo- sition" is understood to be a "view" to begin with, determined by the "aes- thetic sense" or will-to-form of specific races and ages. Ornament has thus oc- cupied a place in world historical spec- ulation of the grandest sort. Worringer, in a chapter summarizing a long schol- arly literature, writes that "it is of the essence of ornament that in its products the artistic volition of a people finds its most unobscured expression." From ornament "the specific peculiarities of the absolute artistic volition can be clearly read off." He ends his chapter with an example of such a clear reading- off. The interlace betrays "the decisive Winter 1982 309</page><page sequence="10">formula for the whole medieval North. ... The need for empathy of this inhar- monious people... needs the uncanny pathos which attaches to the animation of the inorganic. The inner disharmony and unclarity of these peoples .. could have borne no clearer fruit." 10 Panofsky, Meaning in the Visual Arts, p. 26. 11 Ibid., p. 39. 12 Ibid., pp. 40-41. 13 Ibid., p. 32. Panofsky, of course, was writing "an introduction to the study of Renaissance art." His method, how- ever, has been generalized away from that base. 14 Panofsky (ibid., p. 12), in discussing the relation of "form" to "content," takes the classic Aristotelian position that "the element of 'form' is present in every object without exception, for every object consists of matter and form." 15 Ibid., pp. 28-29. 16 Any painting can be analyzed into pla- nar structure, but to do so indiscrimi- nately obscures the crucial difference between images in which such structure is an issue and images in which it is not, or is not a primary issue. Such analysis neutralizes the semantic value of planar structure. 17 E. H. Gombrich, Meditations on a Hobby Horse and Other Essays on the Theory ofArt, London, 1963, p. 10. 18 M. Schapiro, "On Some Problems in the Semiotics of Visual Art: Field and Vehicle in Image-Signs," Semiotica, I, 1969, pp. 238-39. 19 I have generally followed the account of the Tlalocan given by E. Pasztory (The Murals of Tepantitla, Teotihua- can, New York and London, 1976), who reviews previous interpretations, including that which gave the fresco the name by which it will be called in this article. 20 They are "at least potentially identifia- ble" because although an outlined form may not correspond to anything, it al- ways seems as if it does, or might. 21 Schapiro ("On Some Problems," p. 237) rejects the notion that conceptual order is simply an alternative perspec- tive. 22 Ibid., p. 236. 23 Ibid., pp. 223-26. 24 See, for example, the Leopard Shrine at Catal Hiiyiik (J. Mellaart, Catal Hiiyiik, A Neolithic Town in Anatolia, New York, 1967, pp. 118-20). 25 S. Giedion (The Eternal Present: The Beginnings ofArchitecture, New York, 1964) puts great stress on the plane, especially in Egyptian art, but develops it from what he seems to regard as the deeper principle of verticality. See, for example, p. 470, where he writes that "the starting point is always the plane surface. The vertical engendered the plane: then the vertical plane became a picture plane. " 26 Since conceptual images are significant in relation to the real space of the viewer, size is of crucial importance. A plane may be of any shape or size. A real plane of any shape may also be of any size, which is to say that it can have the same proportions. This being the case, its divisions can be in the same relations at any size, so that the order evident in the Tlalocan will be the same in a small reproduction of it. As the size of such a reproduced image decreases, the order becomes literally abstract, at a remove from its real spatial basis, and the order in itself tends towards the syntactic as signs tend towards the ideographic. Whatever its size, the image preserves the values of univo- cality and completeness essential to it. In our imaginary Impressionist painting, the context of the marks is also pre- served in reproduction, and it also loses significant values of actual size. But those values are different: the image loses the absolute scale of autographic facture. The real spatial basis of the painting is reduced to facing and up- rightness, and size is overshadowed by scale. In fact, actual size may be said to be negatively significant in that it is denied to the fullest possible extent in favor of a large virtual space. 27 On bilateral symmetry, see H. Weyl, Symmetry, Princeton, 1952, chapter 1; and Schapiro, "Some Problems," pp. 231-33. 28 In the viewer's own space any image (if right and left are an issue, as opposed to the deeper principle of symmetry) has its own right and left. In Precolumbian art there are a number of split images, spanning a long period and many cul- tures, in which life is associated with the image's right, death with its left. See, from Tlatilco, P. Westheim, The Art of Ancient America, Garden City, 1965, pl. 44; and from Olmec, I. Bolz, Meisterwerke altindianischer Kunst: Die Sammlung Ludwig im Rauten- strauch-Joest-Museum Koln, Reckling- hausen, 1975, nos. XX--XXII; and, at the other end of the time scale, the joined figures of Quetzalcoatl and Mictlantecuhtli in the Codex Borgia. 29 H. Frankfort (Cylinder Seals: A Docu- mentary Essay on the Art and Religion of the Ancient Near East, London, 1939 pls. IIIA and IIIB) distinguishes be- tween antithetical groups, whose pur- pose is to show figures in relation to a central more powerful image, and "rit- ual scenes" or "heraldic groups," which are elaborated decoratively (hor- ror vacui, interlacing, and fantastic monsters). 30 As a fulfillment of Schapiro's sugges- tion that a modern artist faced with the problem of making political hierarchy visible might solve it in the ways in which earlier artists had done, we may consider the photomontage of Hitler opening the House of German Art in Munich in 1937 (reproduced by J. Wil- lett, Expressionism, New York-Toron- to, 1970, p. 197). There, Hitler is ele- vated and centered in such a way that he appears not only to "command" the order of those flanking him, but also to be identified with the axis of the institu- tion before which he stands. If it should be argued that this image was meant to identify Hitler in accordance with an- cient conventions of religious and polit- ical imagery, I would suggest that the placement of Hitler to the side of the podium he commands in the manipu- lated image alters the relation of his image to the semantic possibilities of planarity, just as a life-size statue of an emperor cannot be the same image as a colossal statue. 31 On left, right, and the "reading" of works of art, see Weyl, Symmetry, pp. 16-17, with bibliography. 32 Gombrich, Meditations, p. 9. 33 On the idea of the "conventional" as the pre-naturalistic, see my "Conven- tions in the History of Art," New Liter- ary History, XIII, 1, 1981, pp. 103-25.
