<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FRENCH REVIEW, Vol. 62, No. 4, March 1989 Printed in U.S.A. The Devil and His Disciples in the Lives of Six Saints by Rafael Robert Delfin THE IMAGE OF THE DEVIL has never been positive, at least in the Christian perspective. Biblical tradition has immensely influenced the succeeding literary traditions in their portrayal of the devil. In Medieval French drama, the "prince of darkness" is often times portrayed as a pathetic buffoon: Starting as a fallen angel and tempter, the devil does not take on a quasi- human shape until the 14th century, when acting like a human being in a feudal context. At first following divine command, the devil gradually becomes an Anti-Lord (Anti-Christ) and is placed in hell. The more he is polarized with God, the more he develops into a comic figure, or, in Rudwin's words, "he was at once the great fallen archangel of heaven and the painted clown of the countryfair." (Du Bruck 177) In medieval French hagiography, the devil is virtually represented as a loser. The role of the winner is always attributed to the saint or the martyr. Yet, the holy hero would not be otherwise unless contrasted with his evil counterpart. In his book, The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity, Jeffrey Burton Russell defines the Devil as "the hypostasis, the apotheosis, the objectification of a hostile force or hostile forces perceived as external to our consciousness. These forces, over which we appear to have no conscious control, inspire the religious feelings of awe, dread, fear, and horror" (34). The Devil, therefore, according to Russell, is the opposite of the good source, God. In the Judeo-Christian tradition where the Devil has been personified as Satan, Lucifer or Beelzebub among others, God's manifestation of his goodness is personi- fied not just in his miracles but also in his disciples. Medieval hagio- graphers, conscious of this duality between good and evil, strive to promote the Christian concept of goodness in a more concentrated and individual- ized manner-in narrating the lives of saints. Having attained moral perfection, the saints become immune to diabolical intentions; the Devil's attempt to destroy his enemies crumbles and he himself is left in derision. There is, however, a fine line that separates the hagiographic view of the Anti-Christ as an object of ridicule and the scriptural view of him as the Great Destroyer, not to be ridiculed but to be feared. This distinction is best clarified by Paul Ricoeur who defines evil as "supremely the crucial experience of the sacred" (9). The battle image between good and evil can perhaps only be represented superficially through literary means, but 591</page><page sequence="2">592 FRENCH REVIEW reality still remains the great mother of experience. Thus, according to Christopher Nugent: "The demonic cannot be defined; it can only be contemplated-and experienced" (4). It is interesting to relate Nugent's demonic to Russell's observation of the Devil's role at the time of the New Testament: he was the personification of evil; he did physical harm to people by attacking their bodies or possessing them; he tested people, tempting them to sin in order to destroy them or recruit him in his struggle against the Lord; he accused and punished sinners; he was the head of a host of evil spirits, fallen angels or demons; he had assimilated most of the evil qualities of ancient destructive nature spirits or ghosts; he was the ruler of this world of matter and bodies until such time as the Lord's own kingdom would come; until that final time he would be in constant warfare against the good Lord; he would be defeated by the good Lord at the end of the world. (256) We see from the list above that the Devil is indeed God's Antithesis, capable of anything evil. Medieval vernacular hagiographers profit from their narratives by exploiting the big contrast between the Devil and God. To them, eternal sanctification has always meant heroism; the exaltation of the holy character reveals the writer's identification with sanctity and public outcry of the diabolical. This essay seeks to define the role of the Devil in six medieval hagiographical texts with special emphasis on the devil's discourse (Mary the Egyptian, Jehan Paulus), on his physical representation and strength (Margaret, Juliana), and on his demonic powers manifested by his disciples, the pagan tyrants (Faith, Barbara).1 The Devil's seductive discourse plays an important role in the lives of many saints. Even in narratives where the personification of the Devil is not apparent, his malevolent intentions can be easily felt by the reader through the protagonist's "irreverent" experiences. In the case of Mary the Egyptian, the demonic forces of drunkenness, prostitution, and sexual lust take so strong a toll that it is almost inconceivable whether or not a spiritual conversion is still possible. We see Mary first as an anxious rebel, running away from her family to live the life of debauchery for seventeen years. Possessed by her evil mentor, she engages in all kinds of obscene sexual acts, including adultery. In fact, the Devil's spirit is incarnated in Mary herself. Her intention to satisfy her lust with a group of pilgrims on a ship signifies the penetration of evil into a milieu whose piety crumbles when no man could resist the temptress's deadly allure (ls. 132-37). Mary's power of seduction is so strong that it can even withstand storms or tempests (Is. 140-42), a scenario that could easily defy a realistic analysis.2 An orgy amidst violent waves and roaring winds hardly does justice to a fair conception of possible, life-like circumstances, such as the fact that no man even attempts to jump off the ship to escape sin or that no one even tries to stop Mary. It is interesting to note that the ship scene parallels so much the Edenic experience in some ways. The absence of the mention of other women aboard the ship indicates the omnipresence and the</page><page sequence="3">THE DEVIL AND HIS DISCIPLES 593 omnipotence of the evil feminine represented by Mary. Even if there are other women on the ship, their faith is not potent enough to subdue the fatal temptress. This would be a sure sign that the women themselves may have participated also in indecent acts with Mary or amongst themselves. We have said earlier that the Devil, as an angel of light, could take any shape or form in order to deceive and finally capture his victim. Mary's alluring appearance is to the pilgrims a deadly trap rather than a test of faith. We are often times reminded of the serpent's temptation of Eve as the prelude to being deceived, and of Eve's temptation of Adam as the prelude to mortal sin. The contaminated ship is paradise lost. Paradise is regained at the church of the Holy Cross (ls. 183-206) where Mary fails to go beyond its threshold. Despite her wickedness, we see a shred of morality in Mary who decides to spend Ascension Day by refraining from her usual sinful behavior and by adoring the cross. It is, however, a sort of morality that fluctuates, that has to be carefully screened and evaluated by the mysterious force which finally prevents her from entering the church. The motif of the Ascension Day evokes the image of Christ ascending to heaven and assuring his disciples of his second coming. If we observe more carefully, we may view this whole scene as completely holy, that is, that the pentecostal experience of Christ and his disciples is not spoiled by some impious element, at least according to the scriptural illustration.3 We see almost the same event taking place in the church: Mary's inability to penetrate the holy gathering is a sure sign of the total exclusion of evil from the sanctified circle, a scene which apparently echoes the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Eden. Likewise, the couple's realization of shame, generated by their disobedience to God, parallels strongly with Mary's realization of her own sinfulness. There are, however, slight differences in the two scenarios. First of all, there is neither an Old Testament account of Adam and Eve's repentance nor a dramatic metamorphosis in the couple's spiritual reconstruction. One must wait for the New Testament's view of redemption in order to understand the concept of forgiveness. We immediately visualize Mary's repentance when she confesses her sins to an image of the Virgin Mary who speaks and orders the temptress to do penance in the forest. The sinner's goal to achieve spiritual perfection is yet threatened by the Devil who tempts her back to her old ways. We can almost feel the adversary's 'humanness' in terms of his deceptive logic which fails; this contrasts sharply with Mary's "superhumanness" when she admits to having forgotten her sinful life due to an intensive self-training of living purely. Finally, after seven years, the Devil gives up his evil ploys and abandons the repentant. In the life of Jehan Paulus, however, the Devil's ruse recurs with successful results. We see the Devil jealous of Jehan's holy mode of life in the desert where the saint builds a chapel and spends his days fasting and his nights praying. One cannot help but compare Jehan's experience with</page><page sequence="4">594 FRENCH REVIEW that of Mary the Egyptian. Although we are not sure of Jehan's past life before his repentance, we know that he, like Mary, has to endure the harshness of nature and to undergo a radical physical transformation, that is to say from being attractive to being hideous (ls. 869-80). Whereas visual provocation seems to function as a classical point of departure in unveiling the adversary's jealousy or anger, material temptation seems to serve as the adversary's favorite prop of victimization. An advocation for return to total concrete fulfillment and for abandon- ment of abject poverty within nature is all produced via a diabolical pep talk. Thus, Mary is tempted by all the things of comfort in addition to a return to her sinful past, to which she easily resists. Jehan is tempted by his former life at home, by the illustrious position of a bishop, and by the chance to have the daughter of a count as his wife (ls. 1009-28). Jehan successfully resists all of these temptations by crossing himself. Making a sign of the cross is usually the saint's best protection against the Devil; it has become a sort of demon repellant. However, this is not necessarily true with Mary, whose self-trained sanctity is enough to get rid of her tempter (ls. 512-18), perhaps an indication of a strong woman who relies on nothing but herself for protection. The Devil tempts Jehan again and reminds him of his lineage, inheritance and possessions, to which the saint resists successfully for the second time. Angered by his own failure, the Devil kidnaps the king's beautiful daughter and uses her to seduce Jehan.4 The saint submits to fornication, to unbearable guilt, and finally to the murder of the daughter by throwing her in a well (ls. 1130-55), not to mention his act of blasphemy by destroying his chapel. We not only see a great triumph in the Devil's part, but also in the fact that the whole scenario evokes the themes of voyeurism and expulsion reminiscent of the biblical tradition. The Devil, who is probably laughing, delights in watching two of his victims engage in sin. Likewise, we perceive the serpent slithering around the tree and hisses in ecstasy while Adam and Eve take a bite of the forbidden fruit which causes their expulsion from Eden. The girl's death only intensifies Jehan's association with evil and generates his rupture from the ecclesiastical circle as he is refused an absolution by the pope. God knows in fact that on the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods, knowing good and evil. -Genesis 3:5 Woman as an instrument of the Devil's ploys is a typical motif in the medieval representation of the downfall of the masculine saint. In principle, Eve was the original sinner, since she encountered the serpent first and she ate the forbidden fruit first. From then on, the label of woman as the cause of human misery has always persisted in the Western tradition. It is not surprising, therefore, if some authors use the theme of partnership</page><page sequence="5">THE DEVIL AND HIS DISCIPLES 595 between woman and the Devil as the primary moving force in their works. Lucy de Bruyn writes: Trust in the heavenly forces and fear of the evil ones intermingled whilst aspiration to holiness vied with a strong attraction to what the bartering fiend had to offer. Wordly progress and the new learning lay at the Devil's disposal, in full measure, and the nouvelle richesse of the Renaissance made 'the apple' look more tempting than ever. As of old, woman was seen to play an important part in the Devil's transactions either by assisting or by thwarting his plans. As a result, a great deal of man's happiness, or misery, depended upon this mediator. (xi) In the interest of simple reasoning, we must, however, make a distinction between woman as accomplice, which suggests aggressivity, and woman as instrument, which indicates passivity. Eve's downfall was caused by her sheer innocence; the fact that she appeared in Eden before the serpent justifies her previous inherent sanctity. Her real sin was the abuse of her free will and not her disobedience of God's word; if Eve before the apple was perfect, then there should not have been any reason for her to forget God's word. The fact the she sprung out of Adam's rib makes Adam a subject as equally to be blamed. We can thus classify Eve as a passive accomplice in the sense that she derives her passivity from her previous inherent holiness, directly from God. Aggression can only originate from a deliberate rupture from passivity. In other words, before the serpent's appearance, Eve remained inherently holy and passive to God, and her role as the Devil's accomplice only takes effect when she loses track of her divine passivity by submitting to the exchange of wisdom. In Jehan's story, we are inclined to identify the king's daughter with Eve. We know from the text's description that the girl exemplifies the traditional medieval female virtues of beauty, courtly manners and wisdom. Yet the fact that the girl shows neither contempt nor pride and that her heart is good (Is. 1069-72) hardly classifies her as a Christian. Moreover, she abandons herself to the Devil, allows herself to be possessed, and does not retaliate against Jehan's lethal aggression. Not even a simple sign of the cross is made. We can only assume, therefore, that she is a pagan. Like Eve, her mind is easily beguiled by the Devil. But unlike Eve, the poor girl merely functions as the Devil's instrument to destroy Jehan. It is not clear if the girl purposely allowed herself to be possessed by the Devil in order to satisfy perhaps an unconscious desire to commit adultery with a holy man such as Jehan. The girl's physical aggressiveness is revealed when she runs into Jehan's arms the moment she sees him (ls. 1130-31), and while she grasps him out of fear (1. 1134). Viewed from the assumption that the girl is pagan, we can thus infer that she indeed made a transaction with the Devil, and that includes committing adultery with Jehan. In this manner, and according to de Bruyn's observation, we can thus classify her also as an accomplice. Her death signifies her utter depreciation. Yet when we find out that she is brought back to life through</page><page sequence="6">596 FRENCH REVIEW Jehan's miracle, we immediately discard her label as a pagan and consider her as an innocent Christian after all, knowing that she does not have to repent for her sins. We have seen that the Devil's discourse consists basically of making the saint fall away from grace by tempting the saint back to his or her sinful past. The Devil either fails or succeeds, depending on his victim's spiritual strength. We also know that since evil entered the paradise, it has taken the form of a serpent or dragon as its tangible representation in the Old Testament. However, to the Gospels, the question of the physical portrayal of the Devil is completely foreign. We must look at medieval iconography in order to grasp different artistic images of the Adversary. In Western literature, the physical qualities of the Devil are perhaps most imaginatively described into words in vernacular medieval hagiography. The stereotypi- cal characterization of the Devil as a totally hideous dragon only equals his evil nature. Being a strange mixture of different creatures, the dragon is perhaps even more dangerously equipped than any of his mythical rivals.5 This provides him with all the necessary tools to capture his victim. In the story of Saint Margaret, the Devil is described as dark (1. 279). The association of darkness with evil and of light with goodness derives its popularity from the biblical tradition. The lost soul, unwilling to see the light of truth, is forever enclosed in the darkness of hell. According to the text's description, the Devil is said to have a huge head with long and wide ears, and black hair (ls. 282). We can only imagine the hugeness of the Devil's head in terms of dimension. Although we cannot take the myth of a dragon as a realistic representation of the person of the Devil, we can allow the battle between the dragon and the saint as emblematic of the battle between David and Goliath. The Devil's large and big eyes, shining like fire (ls. 283-84) signify his hypnotic powers.6 The flames coming out of his nostrils and spraying an evil smell (ls. 285-86) evoke his threatening and dangerous intentions. The teeth's roundness provides him perhaps with the facility to detain, but without hurting his victim. Thus, Margaret is swallowed by the dragon in one gulp (1. 301) and escapes from his belly without a scratch.' The dragon's mouth, darker than iron (1. 288), represents the terrifying abyss where the sinners are thrown, and his foul breath (1. 291) which invaded the whole cell denotes the unbearable odor reminiscent of underground sewers. His beard and hair which looked like pure gold, contrasts with the blackness of the hair described in 1. 280. We can only presume that the author may have intended to promote the dragon's ability to transform itself rapidly; furthermore, the image of a hairy dragon accentuates the creature's human traits.8 Once the dragon is slain, a dark man "Who did not look like a Christian/ And was blacker than an Egyptian" (ls. 311-12) comes toward Margaret and introduces himself as Beelzebub, the king and lord of the devils (ls. 330-34). This scene manifests the Devil's desire to avenge the death of the dragon, whom he calls as his brother, Ruffin. We not only see a curious</page><page sequence="7">THE DEVIL AND HIS DISCIPLES 597 exhibition of brotherly quality in the part of the Devil but also a sort of hierarchical structure in the profession of evil acts. Beelzebub, who claims to send his "friends and soldiers" to deceive sinners, fulfills the role of the evil mastermind; Ruffin, the dragon, plays second fiddle to Beelzebub, thereby suggesting that there is no such thing as infernal equality amongst demons. The question of the avenging devil originates from the Devil's desire to retrieve his place in heaven-an act that could only be made possible through the saint's intercession (1. 318). Beelzebub's confession of him as the cause of Margaret's tortures underlines another important trait, the manifestation of the diabolical truth. The Devil does not lie in self- revelation; he is the dark Absolute Truth. Medieval hagiography triumphs in implementing the Devil's auto-identification via an undisclosed language that the Scriptures could not provide otherwise. As a consequence, we have instead an apologetic monologue aiming to divert the saint's own mode of holy apologetics. Yet much to the Devil's surprise, his words are no match to the saint's quick actions. By pinning down the Devil tightly underneath her foot, the saint subverts the biblical imagery of the serpent's victory over Eve. Thus we have the liberation of the amazonic female armed with righteousness par excellence. DuBruck's observation appears relevant to this situation. Comic relief is induced when the Devil is vanquished by Margaret: he cries out and begs for mercy, and almost loses his breath from the weight of the saint's foot. There is an ironic touch in this particular scene, which calls for a contrast with the dragon scene. The Devil, as Ruffin, enjoys the tremendous physical strength that his humanoid brother, Beelzebub, fails to produce. Ruffin could have easily killed Margaret with flames or by squashing her to death. Yet by not doing so, the saint is given the chance to display a most powerful outward sign of Christianity, the sign of the cross. Beelzebub becomes a butt of joke not only in his physical weakness but also in his deviated role as an intelligent fallen angel. If he claimed to be responsible for Margaret's tortures, he could have caused a mutilation of the saint's arms to prevent her from crossing herself. And if he wanted to avenge his brother's death, he could have transformed himself into a bigger and stronger chimera. It is from this angle that medieval hagiography becomes an ideal space for satire of the Devil. The latter, in Rudwin's words, becomes the "pointed clown of the countryfair." However, ridicule seems not to be limited to the Devil alone. The Devil's false sincerity, marked by his promise of never again causing harm to Margaret, liberates him from the saint's heavy foot. The saint, in effect, has been fooled into believing that no more harm will be done to her by the Devil, which of course is not true when the saint is captured and beheaded by the tyrant Olymbrius. A more dramatic attempt to ridicule the Devil is described in the account of Juliana. The Devil, disguised as an angel, appears in a cell where the saint has been detained (1. 377). In comparison to the dragon who appeared to</page><page sequence="8">598 FRENCH REVIEW Margaret, Juliana's Devil boasts of 'beautiful appearance' (1. 381) and blinding brightness (1. 382) that illuminates the dark cell. Mistaking the Devil for a real angel, Juliana submits to her adversary's misleading speech of abandoning her pledge to Christ by marrying a pagan and worshipping the pagan gods (Is. 394-407). At first, the Devil succeeds in deceiving his victim, as marked by her ecstatic reaction (Is. 409-11), yet later we see Juliana consulting the Holy Spirit for a verification of the Devil's words. A real angel appears and instructs Juliana to capture the Devil (Is. 443-59). In contrast to Margaret's case where the Devil is pinned down by the saint's foot, Juliana's Devil is tied up by an iron collar and struggles mightily by shouting, jumping and fighting (ls. 463-66), an image of the Adversary in his most boisterous and sometimes childish behavior which adds flavor to the comic portrayal. Perhaps the most interesting characteristic of the entire scene is its cunning interplay with the reversal of roles. The Devil, who usually plays the role of the cruel accuser such as portrayed by tyrants, is reduced to the part of the guilty victim. Juliana, like Margaret, takes the role of the holy interrogator who forces the Devil to confess his intentions. Also, Juliana's heroism, like Margaret's, is enhanced not by serenity but by her resort to violence. The Devil identifies himself as Satan9 and says that he is sent by his master, Beelzebub. We have just seen in Margaret's account that Beelzebub is freed from the saint's heavy foot; one may wonder if Beelzebub avenges his lost battle with Margaret by sending his comrade Satan to destroy Juliana. The absurd comic intensifies when the sleeping Beelzebub does not hear Satan's plea for help (Is. 715-19), underlining the Devil's dormancy and perhaps indifference towards his disciples. We are often times reminded of the cocu battu motif which is popular with the fabliaux, as the Devil is beaten continuously by the righteous heroine. Yet unlike the beaten cuckold who is not necessarily forced to divulge all of his mischievous intentions, the beaten Devil is forced to reveal everything from beginning to end. In his first beating, we are informed of the Devil's trick of distracting a virtuous man from his prayers by reminding him of his domestic tasks; such a scene alludes back to the fundamental role of the Devil as a material enticer. In his second beating, the Devil is forced to state how one can avoid his temptations, which is quite absurd given the idea that the Devil himself provides the audience instructions for his own expulsion. Not yet satisfied with her victim's words, Juliana demands for more, thus causing the Devil's anger to explode. Despite her earlier promise of letting the Devil go after his full confession, Juliana betrays her victim by dragging him out in the streets for public humiliation. The saint is encountered by pagan townspeople who address her sweetly as "holy and precious virgin" (1. 893), which may be a little absurd by virtue of the fact that Christian sanctity should still be a foreign notion to the idolatrous pagans. Nevertheless, we take it for granted that the obvious physical differences between the saint and the Devil reflect the pagans' concept of</page><page sequence="9">THE DEVIL AND HIS DISCIPLES 599 beauty as good and ugly as evil. In comparison to Margaret's story where the Devil is 'gently' treated, Juliana's Devil undergoes physical torture that could provoke a good Christian laugh: he is tossed high in the air and then lands in a slough which creates an earth-shattering noise (Is. 925-38), reminiscent of Goliath's fall. All this is done without any hint of blood, perhaps a reminder of the avenging saint whose immaculate appearance is generated by its resistance to all kinds of stains. Although Juliana's victory over the Devil is short-lived (her enemy escapes and disappears), the Devil's pathetic situation lingers on in his stupidity of not disappearing sooner than it was necessary. We have seen, according to DuBruck's observation, that medieval French drama treats the Devil as a comic act, as proven especially by his failure to destroy the saint and by his physical weakness. Medieval hagiography, however, is very much conscious of the reality of the Devil as it is of his disciples. Our final study focuses on the demonic as portrayed by the pagan tyrants. The Diocletian persecutions caused the deaths of many Christians who refused to worship pagan idols. One of these Christian martyrs was a young girl from Agen named Faith. We know immediately from the text's description that the emperors of Rome, Diocletian and Maximian, had neither love for God but "served/and obeyed the Devil" (Is. 114-16). From this context, we can affirm that the tyrants are in direct association with their master to whom they have pledged perpetual loyalty. Later, we are informed of the emperors' prefect, Dacian who "hated all forms of virtue" (1. 177), enters the city of Agen and conducts some sort of a loyalty poll. It is interesting to examine the kind of love that Dacian promises anyone who would be willing to honor the gods (1. 194). The Christians, while insisting on universal acceptance and charity, can still afford to love the vilest enemies; the pagan love, on the other hand, is based not on one authority like Christ but rather on the heterogeneity of many authorities. Whereas Christian love emphasizes unity, meaning one body in Christ, pagan love advocates promiscuity, meaning different loves not necessarily conforming to one particular deity. Thus, we see Dacian who bribes the townspeople of his praise, reward and protection if they worship the idols. The prefect's role as a promoter of pagan worshipping is not dissimilar to the role of a saint or martyr who evangelizes the Gospels. Both parties employ a powerful and persuasive rhetoric in order to win followers for each side. Although it happens that the tyrant's promise of civil protection should not be taken as a definite security much as the saint's promise of salvation should not be regarded as absolute. This is apparent in both group and individual disobedience. Thus, to the pagans, the Christian martyr is a dangerous threat to their religious experience as much as they are a big stumbling block to the spread of the Gospels. Like Satan, the tyrant functions essentially as an accuser. Saint Faith is brought before Dacian and is forced to renounce her beliefs. Like his lascivious master, the Devil, he marvels at her beauty (Is. 268, 313) and</page><page sequence="10">600 FRENCH REVIEW likens her to the goddess Diana (1. 324). This scene reminds us once again of the Edenic serpent who tempts Eve with the fruit of knowledge. By eating the forbidden fruit, Eve will be able to act like God; likewise, by worshipping Diana, Faith is supposed to acquire the goddess's powers and special disposition. Dacian's role as an interrogator rivals Faith's role as an eloquent defendant. Cruel as he may seem, Dacian's temperament, however, is controllable. He chooses for instance to speak leniently (1. 304) and to show indulgence (1. 305) to pervert Faith's holy reasoning. He loses his temper and casts an evil glance to the saint after she insults the pagan idols (1. 350-51). His anger turns into wrath as he threatens the maiden with deadly torments; finally, his wrath culminates when he orders his soldiers to torture Faith on a metal grill. The tyrant's role as a sadist brings forth the age-old problem of evil committed by a human against another human being. The heart of evil is violence and suffering is an aspect of pain. Since being banished from God's kingdom, the Devil has always avenged his painful fall. And since he was once an angel of light and is more intelligent than humans, he knows exactly that the only way to satisfy his revenge is to inflict his evil intentions on his followers who would then abuse their demonic prowess with their Christian victims. The tyrant is now not just a personification of evil in a passive sense but an actual diabolical agent. He, of course, does not always win, especially in spiritual debates. This trait is best exemplified by Capraise, who echoes Faith's eloquent defense of Christ, thus causing Dacian to admit his weakness in arguing (Is. 707-15). Therefore, the tyrant, knowing no other way to impose his demands on the martyr, resorts to murdering his victim as the only solution to regain his lost honor. Demonic violence is not limited to emperors and prefects. In the case of Barbara, the saint's father Dyoscorus betrays his own daughter and leads her to her death. Hurt by Barbara's indifference towards her suitors, Dyoscorus orders the construction of a tower where his daughter is to be kept from being stolen (Is. 61-64). Barbara's position is merely reduced to a prized object rather than a sentient human being. She provokes her father's desire to kill her when she orders the masons to construct three windows, instead of two, to signify the Holy Trinity (1. 115). Running out in the fields to pray, the saint is captured by her father who beats her and drags her down the hill while pulling her blond hair (Is. 208-15). This scene is a cynical reversal of the battle between Margaret and Beelzebub where the saint pulls down the Devil by his black hair. Although we do not know much of Dyoscorus' physical appearance, we can only speculate that he resembles more or less the dark and hairy Beelzebub in Margaret's account; he definitely cannot be of light appearance since it would only conflict with Barbara's radiance. His neglected paternity is underlined in his order to have his daughter detained without any food, comfort or solace in her cell (Is. 217-18). Aware of the state's treatment of Christians, he informs the prefect about his daughter's radical act of denouncing the pagan gods. By</page><page sequence="11">THE DEVIL AND HIS DISCIPLES 601 doing this, Dyoscorus becomes a direct accomplice of the prefect, yet at the same time, he facilitates or rather diminishes the prefect's role as hunter of Christians. The prefect does not need to displace himself to hunt; the hunted is already presented right before him. The father's indifference towards his daughter culminates when he watches her being undressed and whipped incessantly with heavy lashes (ls. 256-262). Dyoscorus, the pathetic voyeur, turns also into a silent partner as the prefect devises the best way to torture Barbara to death (ls. 269-270)-by ripping her breasts with a sword (Is. 231-32). After unsuccessful attempts to kill the saint by various cruel tortures, Dyoscorus decapitates Barbara as a final act of his brutal force. The tragedy of Barbara's account acquires its sensationalism from the deviant role of the father who subverts from his traditional obligation to love and protect his daughter. Without such deviance, there would not perhaps be any kind of narrative freshness. Also, the popular belief that the power of the Holy Spirit predominates in a sanctified circle is something worthy to be discussed. This power may be controlling entirely some selected circles, but definitely not Barbara's relationship with her father. Dyoscorus is merely the other half, the evil one, whereas Barbara is the remaining half, the good one. In a liberal objective, Barbara fails to make a complete holy circle, or a total halo, out of her father's persistent cruelty. Although it may seem less tragic than her torture, we see in the end that her father dies from a fire sent from heaven (Is. 375-76), symbolic once again of the triumph of good over evil. Medieval hagiography's portrayal of the Devil may or may not cause any frightening effect on the Christian reader; it all depends on the form of rhetoric that hagiographers use to remind the Christian of what awaits him after a sinful life and of course, on the spiritual strength of the believer. A metaphysical dichotomy between good and evil is first of all essential in a subsequent profound analysis of each element. Although medieval hagiography's representation of the Devil may often times appear superficially structured, the Devil's inherent "un-Christlike" qualities, anthropomorphic as they are illustrated, remain realistically horrifying. Paradise can now be regained through the dynamics of sanctity and its total extinction of the underworld.

Gerard Blangez summarizes the devil's disposition according to the book's (Ci-Nous-Dit) classification of hierarchy: Car tous les diables ne sont pas en enfer actuellement. Quand ils ont &amp;te pr&amp;cipit6s du ciel, ceux qui sont tombes de plus haut se sont enfonc6s plus profond, et les 'diables d'enfer' sont les plus m&amp;chants, ceux qui avaient ete les plus beaux anges. D'autres sont restes sur terre, d'autres meme en l'air oui ils sont seulement exclus du ciel. Les diables de l'air "se meslent avec" les orages et les tempetes . . (the demon of lust that possesses Mary may well belong to this category). Les diables qui sont sur terre s'occupent de nous tenter pour retarder le jour du Jugement oui leur peine doublera. (26-28) 3A partial unholiness could only have been perpetrated by Judas Iscariot whose death "purifies" the pentecostal circle. 41t is interesting to find out if there are any female saints in medieval hagiography who are tempted by an exceptionally good-looking and sexually provocative man, fail in resisting temptation, and resort to killing the seducer. We see, however, an equally cynical paragon in the story of Margaret where the saint is detained in a cell, attacked and swallowed by a dragon, and succeeds in killing the creature by splitting its belly with a sign of the cross. The latter synthesis only proves that two totally different poles hardly get along with each other. sFor a concise information on dragons, see Man, Myth and Magic, vol. 3. 6It is interesting to note that the very word "dragon" evolved from the ancient Greek word, derkesthai, which means "to see" or "to look at". (Webster's Third New International Dictionary). 7In Christine de Pisan's version, the dragon only attempts to swallow Margaret who succeeds in slaying the creature with a sign of the cross. 'Perhaps the most infamous hairy mythical creature associated with the Devil and possessing the most human traits is the werewolf. 9For a detailed analysis of the etymological origin of the word 'Satan', see Satan in the Old Testament by Rivkah Schlirf Kluger, 25-34.
