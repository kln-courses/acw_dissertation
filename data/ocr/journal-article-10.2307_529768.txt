<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction From June 1 through August, 1975, preliminary ex- cavations were carried out at the Rio Claro site (H-CN- 12)' in the Aguan River Valley, Department of Colon, NE Honduras. The project, under the direction of the author, was the second Eleld season of an ongoing pro- ject sponsored in 1975 by research grants from the National Geographic Society with additional support from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the American Council of Learned Societies, and Trent University (Ontario, Canada). Full permission for the archaeological research in Colon was granted by the Instituto Hondureno de Antropologia e Historia.2 Background The Republic of Honduras is a remarkably diverse cultural, geographical, and ecological portion of Cen- tral America with a unique, and still poorly understood 1. The abbreviation H-CN-12 follows the site designation system for the New World described in J. Rowe, "Site Designation in the Americas," AmAnt 36 (1971) 477-80. The "H" stands for the Republic of Honduras, the "CN" for the department of Coloon, and the "12" means that this is the twelfth archaeological site identified and reported in that area. 2. An earlier version of this article was prepared for the 1976 New Jersey Academy of Sciences meeting held at Rutgers University, Camden, and a second revision for the 42nd annual meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in New Orleans, Louisiana, 1977, as part of a symposium organized by the author and entitled "Southern Periphery of Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica: Honduras and El Salvador." prehistory (FIG. 1). Prior to the Spanish explorations of the 16th and 17th centuries, Honduras was a land of many varied, scattered aboriginal groups, and marked the southernmost edge of high Mayan development. This border appears to have been drawn at about the Ulua River in western Honduras, though scholars have disagreed somewhat on the precise placement of the boundary.3 Beyond the Ulua River, linguists, ethnog- raphers, and ethnohistorians alike have differed over the assignment of tribal identifications to a plethora of native groups.4 Archaeologically, the situation deteri- orates even more with much of the territory east of the Ulua River, which is virtually terra incognita. Early studies in the NE half of Honduras have been remarkably limited but suggest that the region shows 3. Samuel K. Lothrop, "The Southeastern Frontier of the Maya," AmAnth 41 (1939) 42-54. J. M.

Only quite early, and rather limited, excavations had been record- ed before 1975, and the second season of the National Geographic-Northeast Honduras project concentrated on an intensive study of a Cocal Period site in an effort to provide some basic chronometric, settlement, and subsistence data for comparison with the earlier periods. The Archaeological Locality Site H-CN-12 is located adjacent to an ancient, and now dry, watercourse not far from the modern Rio Claro. The Rio Claro today is a narrow tributary to the winding, 200 km.-long Aguaon River, a major waterway connecting central Honduras with the Caribbean coast (FIG. 2). The site is situated on gradually rising ground above the rich agricultural floor of the Aguan River Valley and on the foothills of the mountain range (Cor- dillera Nombre de Dios) that forms the northern bound- ary of the valley. The site was first explored in 1973 by the author in a survey for the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology (Harvard University). At that time the site vegetation was so exceedingly dense that it was not possible to undertake a map survey and only a few preliminary observations were made.8 By late 1974, however, much of this tropical foresta- tion had been leveled as a consequence of the destruc- tive effects of Hurricane ;;FiEl" with subsequent reset- tlement clearing and new farming efforts. The site was largely cleared in the summer of 1975, enabling at least preliminary site mapping and mound location. From this work the site of Rio Claro was seen to be larger than any other known Colo'n settlements, measuring 6. Paul F.

(in note 5). about 450 m. x 190 m., and rising, at some points, some 12 m. above the present alluvial valley plain. More than 50 rectangular, square, and some irregularly-shaped earthen constructions were identiEled and plotted on a site map (FIG. 3). These are clay mounds faced with tons of stone boulders which had, most likely, been transported from the foothills of the mountain range some 2 km. away. The truncated earthern construc- tions, approached via unmortared stone ramps, served as elevated platforms for longhouse dwellings, with some taller mounds at the site lacking materials and remains suggestive of any utilization for domestic pur- poses. The mounds measure, in several instances, over 50 m. in length, and many still retained single row stone foundation alignments on the flattened surface area, preserving valuable details of prehistoric Cocal Period house proportions, entrance locations, entry sizes, and room locations. The entire site, spread over a NW-SE direction, is situated atop what appears to be a natural raised sec- tion of land (FIG. 4). The site zone is set off from the adjacent terrain by the rather steep plateau rising to the inhabited mound area, and, in lower areas of the site, by what appears to be a man-made depression. This ditch, or depression, encircles at least two-thirds of the site and perhaps more. Away from the site, and beyond the depression and plateau slope area, very little evidence of habitation was found, and no signs of real settlement. The ditch today varies in depth from ca. 1.8- 2.5 m., and was undoubtedly much deeper in prehistoric times. The area having no sign of a ditch (or steep slope) has strong suggestions of having once been a pond or larger body of permanent water. The border of this very low area on the sw side is in rather marked contrast to the plateau face on the SE side of the site, which drops off rapidly over a distance of about 5 m. These distinct topographic features of H-CN-12 strong- ly suggest that defensive precautions were undertaken, an idea further supported by the presence of three separate (but quite similar) stone walkways leading into the site from the NW, south and SE. These walkways, crude mosaics of very large, flat conglomerate stone, vary from 1 m. to 4 m. in width and measure up to 42 m. in length. They commence at the outer limits of the site and extend well into the interior portion. That these walkways were designated entryways into the site and were perhaps part of a fortification-palisade complex surrounding H-CN- 12 seems a reasonable possibility although further investigation is needed. As was noted above, beyond this marked depression there are virtual- ly no cultural remains visible. The overall site topography is dominated by a cen- trally located construction (Mound A) standing about 7 m. above the court level, and some 12 m. above the</page><page sequence="4"> 18 Excavations at Rio Claro, NE Honduras/Healy Figure 3.

This mound is considerably taller than the other structures at the site and has wide stone ramps running up the west and east faces. Examination of the positions of the dozens of other mounds indicates that the habita- tion was fairly congested in prehistoric times with almost every available piece of level land being utilized for building with the possible exception of a large, 3600 sq. m. open plaza to the east of Mound A (FIG. 6) and a probable second, smaller plaza area farther west of the same construction. The other earthen mounds averaged about 1.2 m. in height. Selected Excavations Ten separate excavations were conducted in 1975 to investigate the depositional history and to sample the occupational debris at H-CN-12. All excavations were dug by 25 cm. artificial levels until sterile soil was reached. In several instances of test excavation disturbed fragmentary sections of what appeared to be hard- packed clay floors were tentatively identified, cleared horizontally, and then removed maintaining the ar- tificial level sequence. The artificial levels were utilized because preservation of natural stratigraphy and man- made floors was poor. Pits were strategically placed about the central portion of the site and a number of test excavations made in mounds, court areas, and pottery dumps. Six of these excavations have provided radiocarbon determinations and are briefly summarized here.9 Figure 5. Mound A, H-CN-12:Rio Claro. View from the main plaza floor and looking toward the stone ramp on the east face of the prin- cipal site construction. and the house's terminal entrance. The upper 15-20 cm. of the pit were composed of a black-brown top soil which was well mixed with what are known to be typical Early Cocal Period sherds, obsidian blades, and irregularly-shaped, hardened clay fragments. The latter, termed "briquets," are often the remnants of fire- hardened clay coatings to the house walls and pieces of clay flooring hardened from either accidental or inten- tional burning. In the 25-50 cm. excavation level a small darkened fire pit (D. 54 cm.) was located along the south side of the excavation. The hearth was surround- ed by reddened and fire-hardened clay and fist-sized Pit l Mound B is located on the south side of the main site plaza, and south of Mound A. Though only about 1.2 m. in height, it is one of the longest earthen structures at H-CN-12, measuring a full 59 m. The mound is spatially divided by a stone-boulder ramp that ap- proaches the long mound from the plaza side and divides the construction roughly in two equal parts (see FIG. 3). The western portion of the mound was cleared in 1975 revealing, in the form of stone alignments, the distinct outline of a longhouse. Entrances to the perish- able pole-and-thatch structure were apparently from the north (that is, from the direction of the main plaza). Pit 1, a 2 m. x 2 m. test excavation, was centrally positioned into the top of Mound B at the westernmost end, opposite what appeared, from surface indications, to be a narrow entry ramp from the plaza floor area 9. Stratigraphic details concerning all H-CN-12 excavations, as well as survey and excavations elsewhere in the Department of Colon, will be included in the Final Report (in preparation, 1977).

In profile the fire pit proved quite shallow (maximum depth 23 cm.) but was filled with charred wood fragments. A sample was removed for dating (UGA-1284). By about the 50-cm. depth, the light brown-yellow clay soils gave way to a grey-black lens that ran completely around the excavation pit and suggests a major burn layer at a still earlier time of oc- cupation. Below the ash level to a depth of 75 cm. the soil color changed to a reddish-brown tone and proved sterile. Pit 2 This 2 m. x 2 m. test pit was dug into the summit of Mound C, a 42 m. long mound located on the east side of the main mound (A), and on the north edge of the main plaza. Mound C retained evidence of a stone- boulder house-foundation line similar to, though not quite as well preserved as, that of Mound B some 65 m. to the south. Surface collection of the roughly 1.5 m. tall construction produced obsidian blades, mano frag- ments, Early Cocal pottery, as well as a substantial amount of hard, irregularly-shaped and flattened pieces of clay. These appear to have been fire-hardened fragments of piso, from the hard-packed prehistoric clay flooring of the house interior and mud-and-pole walls. The upper 10 cm., as in all the H-CN-12 excavations, was a darkened humus layer, below which we encoun- tered a finer reddish-brown soil mixed with recogniz- able Early Cocal sherds. The 25-50 cm. level produced a concentration of quite durable brick-red soil in the northeast portion of the pit; again, there were in- dications of clay hardening from fire, intentional or ac- cidental. In the 50-75 cm. level, a charcoal lens was identiEled and a carbon sample removed for dating (UGA-1571). Fewer sherds were found below this level, and sterile soil was reached at 100 cm. Pit 3 Test pit 3, a 2 m. x 4 m. excavation, was placed into the top of Mound E, a long, low habitation mound located on the east side of the main plaza and just adja- cent to (north of) a larger and taller Mound D. The two earth and stone constructions effectively formed the eastern edge of the main courtyard (FIG. 3). Early Cocal sherds and obsidian blades were recovered from the sur- face of Mound E. In the 25-50 cm. level, charcoal con- centrations were identiEled from several different locations and a sample was removed (UGA-1570). The same excavation unit produced more Cocal sherds and obsidian blades. Excavation progressed through sev- eral more levels bearing fewer and fewer cultural Figure 7. Pit 4 (Mound A), H-CN-12:Rio Claro. Photo shows the presence of several structural {loors and layers to a depositional depth of nearly 3 m remains (particularly sherds) before sterile soil was finally reached at 175 cm. Pit 4 This excavation was the largest conducted in 1975, and was placed into Mound A, the principal earthen construction at H-CN-12. The excavation itself was 2 m. wide by 6 m. long, effectively covering the entire flattened surface area of the 7 m. tall platform (FIG. 7). Although some large stones were present on the mound surface (as well as on the ramps on the east and west faces of the mound), these did not form a recognizable foundation pattern -as had been observed on many of the lower mounds at the site. The uppermost two levels of the excavation produced a very high concentration of obsidian blades and frag- ments (21), along with some distinctive Early and Late Cocal pottery. A shallow concentration of charcoal (from a roughly circular hearth) was removed from the south end of the excavation in the 25-50 cm. level (UGA-1573). Several hard-packed floors were iden- tified in the removal of successive levels. An irregular second concentration of carbon (UGA- 1574) was recovered from the 175-200 cm. level, one of the earliest habitation levels at H-CN-12. Sterile soil was reached at 250 cm. A check for further cultural remains below this level proved negative and suggests, in light of the mound's overall size, that Mound A was constructed atop a natural knoll at the site. PitS Mound F is located on the western side of Mound A and stands nearly 2 m. in height. The raised earthen platform appears from preliminary testing to have been,</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field A rchaeology/ Vol. 5, 1978 21 like most of the mounds at H-CN-12, residential in function. Numerous obsidian blades were recovered, mano and metate fragments, a crude, T-shaped chipped stone axe and a large sample of Early Cocal pottery. Although several very large, fallen mahogany trees prevented complete, detailed mapping, the outline of a stone boulder house foundation could be discerned. A 2 m. x 2 m. excavation was dug into the mound surface. Below the dark brown topsoil were several levels of fine brown soil of lighter coloration. In the 125-150 cm. level, along the north edge of the test pit, were recovered the broken remains of two Bay Island Polychrome vessels and an incised punctate Early Cocal "frying pan" censer (FIG. 8). Directly below the smashed ceramic remains was a small charcoal concentration which was removed for dating (UGA-1285). Below this level soil color became considerably darker and sherds decreased in quantity until a sterile tan soil was reached by 175 cm. Pit 7 One of the last test excavations of the 1975 field season was this 2 m. x 3 m. pit placed directly into the plaza floor just to the east of Mound A. The test pit was positioned at the base of the stone boulder ramp of the east face of the main mound (see FIG. 5). The uppermost level of Pit 7 was composed of loose dark soil with com- paratively few sherds. At approximately 15 cm. below the court floor a concentration of charred rocks was noted in one portion of the excavation. Below this darkened concentration was a sterile yellow-orange clay. The 25-50 cm. level revealed a shallow but neatly contained hearth (D. 60 cm.) which produced the seventh carbon-14 sample (UGA-1572) from H-CN-12. Radiocarbon Determinations and NE Honduras Chronology Six of the seven radiocarbon dates obtained from H- CN-12:Rio Claro are consistent with the archaeological data and earlier stylistic estimates (TABLE 1). Only sample UGA-1285, from Pit 5, appears slightly too ear- ly based upon the recognized temporal range for associated remains. The charcoal sample was very small and its true age almost certainly belongs nearer its up- per sigma range (i.e., ca. 835-990 A.C.).10 The other six C-14 determinations, however, firmly date the site's oc- cupation to post-1000 A.C. Only one date (UGA-1573), from Pit 4, fell beyond 1400 A.C. These are the first chronometric age determinations obtained for the Cocal Period of NE Honduras. In reviewing this cultural region as a whole, and its chronology, it is clear that as of this writing there is no archaeological evidence of a Paleo-Indian or Archaic level in NE Honduras. In an earlier report we examined the information derived from a series of caves in the Aguan River Valley which contained Preclassic re- mains. " The ceramic forms and decorative motifs 10.

Chronometric determinations from H-CN-12:Rio Claro, NE Honduras.* tated decoration of a coarse, and predominantly monochrome, ware is the principal ceramic. Only oc- casionally does a painted curvilinear decoration, similar to the incised-punctate designs, appear on this ware; this paint, however, was of a poor quality and is only rarely preserved. Decoration normally consists of sur- face alteration by Elne incised lines and associated punc- tations. This ware was originally designated the North Coast Applique Style by Strong.'3 Some designs of the Early Cocal ceramics have been described by Epstein as an "abstract scroll."'4 Designs include a curvilinear ele- ment "in which a modified or abstracted 's' scroll is used in blocks or bands."'5 These scrolls are incised and the ends of the design often terminate with a punctation mark, or the punctation serves to separate one scroll design from another (see FIGS. 8-10). Collections from excavated units and surface recovery at H-CN-12 included nearly 5000 sherds and partial vessels. These have been classified into some 15 different varieties based upon paste, decoration, and vessel-form differences. Vessel forms are distinctive and include not only more common shapes such as jars (narrow necked ollas), but also shallow, tripod-legged bowls and plates, composite silhouette vessels, urn-like ventilated censers, and "frying pan" style censers with handles. A prominent feature of the Early Cocal forms is the usage of decorated lugs and supports: short tubular handles, often with humanoid representations astride the lug; long, tapered legs; bulbar, anthropo- morphic, hollow supports; and solid, grooved conical legs (FIG. 9). Hollow support forms appear frequently to 13. William D. Strong, "The Archaeology of Honduras," Handbook of South American Indians 4, Bureau of American Ethnology, Bulletin 143 ( 1948) 1 -4 1. 14. Epstein, op. cit. (in note 5) 246-59. 15. Epstein, op. cit. (in note 5) 254. strongly suggest an Early-Middle Preclassic date.'2 There are, however, no radiocarbon dates for this horizon. The succeeding archaeological unit is the Selin Period. The National Geographic-Trent University research has refined the Selin chronology into three parts based upon artifactual changes and seven radio- carbon dates. The subdivisions are: Early Selin (300-600 A.C.), Basic Selin (600-800 A.C.), and Transitional Selin (800-1000 A.C.). The last temporal unit is the least well defined and lacks absolute dates; it is, however, bracketed by dated cultural remains of the Basic Selin and Early Cocal Periods. Based upon the ceramic classification and radiocar- bon determinations we are inclined to bracket the next major cultural era, the Cocal Period, into two units: Early and Late. The Early Cocal Period appears to have lasted from 1000-1400 A.C., and the Late Cocal from 1400 A.C. until the Spanish Entradas and immediately after (ca. 1525-1530 A.C.). H-CN-12:Rio Claro, then, appears to have been constructed chiefly in Early Cocal times. There have been a few surface sherds attributable to the Late Cocal horizon from Rio Claro. There are, however, few well-known Late Cocal sites. One such locality, site H-CN- 12:Km. 19.5, contained simple in- cised Late Cocal pottery in a shell heap setting, along with at least one Naco Red-on-White sherd, a ceramic type diagnostic of the Late Postclassic Period (1200- 1520 A.C.) of Mesoamerica.

The artifacts are broken into two major groups: Chipped Stone and Ground Stone. Chipped Stone The H-CN-12 chipped stone included a sizeable quan- tity (100) of obsidian bladelets, scrapers, flakes, and possible projectile point fragments. These grey-black fragments have been submitted for analysis by neutron activation to the Department of Chemistry and Applied Sciences of the University of Toronto. Only one battered core was recovered; nearly all blades showed signs of retouch and were pitted extensively on the sur- faces. Four crude, T-shaped chipped stone axes were recovered in 1975 from H-CN-12. All were directly associated with Rio Claro house mounds. These were made of a heavy, largely unground basalt, and were no larger than 17 cm. in total length with cutting blade Ceramic artifacts of this era include hollow ocarinas or whistles portrayed in an anthropomorphic form (FIG. 11).

Field, in "Thoughts on the Meaning and Use of Pre-Hispanic Mexican Sellos," Dumbarton Oaks Studies in Pre- Columbian Art and Archaeology 3 (Washington, D.C. 1967) 5, defines a sello as an artifact made of fired clay and incised with various types of designs; the sello is used to imprint its design upon some other sur- face. The forms of sellos range from flat to cylindrical. Pigment was applied to the decorated area of a sello that was then applied to the surface to be decorated.</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Field Archaeology/ Vol. 5, 1978 25  Figure 15.

Manos included several different varieties; metates were predominately of the deep basin, turtle-back type. A local granitic stone was the most commonly selected for both categories of implements. There were several fragmentary examples of more elaborate carved, legged metates from the site as well, and elaborate stone car- ving, particularly of anthropomorphic metates, appears to be a characteristic of the period. Stone illustrates several specimens of probable Early Cocal date from this general vicinity.23 Several of the eight manos and 10 metates were recovered in direct association with specific house mounds. 22. Stone, op. cit. (in note S) fig. 41e, f; Strong, op. cit. (in note S) pl. 19#2. Four ground rubbing and/or pounding stones were recovered; these were of variable form and seem to have been more casually shaped. At least one specimen appears to have been re-worked from a broken mano fragment. Two fragments of stone barkbeaters were recovered at Rio Claro as well. These are the grooved, ovaloid- shaped type that was circumferentially grooved for hafting to a wooden handle. Both fragments (from dif- ferent barkbeaters) were granulite in composition, and are the Elrst such specimens to be recorded from this part of Central America. They appear very similar to specimens from Mesoamerica.24 Some 17 well-polished stone celts/axes (or fragments thereof) were removed from the site (FIG. 14). These are divisible into several different varieties based upon general contours and sizes, which ranged from 5.5 cm. to 12.5 cm. in length for the complete specimens. Near- ly all were made of polished basalt or other hard, Elne- grain stones (porphery, dolerite, gneiss). Nine polished, bi-conically drilled greenstone (prehnite) beads were recovered in association with the floor area of Mound I at H-CN-12. These rounded edge beads ranged from disc-like form to barrel shapes, and were from 0.5-1.5 cm. in length (FIG. 15). The Early Cocal greenstone jewelry is in rather marked contrast from the very long, tubular beads associated with the Selin Period. Other examples of NE Honduran stone jewelry are illustrated by Stone and Strong.25 24. G. R. Willey, The A rtifacts of A ltar de Sacrificios, PapPeaMus 64 (Cambridge 1972); see also Stone, op. cit.

Indeed, the data on burial practices from all of northeast Honduras are pitifully sketchy for virtually all prehistoric periods. From previous research on the Bay Islands, located off the north coast and out of our direct research area, but clearly related culturally in pre-Hispanic times, it appears that urn burials were relatively common. From the stratiEled 80 Acre site on one island (Utila), ex- cavated by Kidder, Stromsvik, and Ekholm in the 1950s, and reported upon by Epstein, it has been suggested that three human interments there (labelled burials 3, 4, and 5) were probably attributable (from associated ceramics) to the Cocal Period.26 Unfor- tunately, none of this skeletal material was saved and Epstein's identiElcations (based solely upon photo- graphs) must be taken with reservation. All of these possible Cocal features were urn burials. There is little, if any, proof of cremation on the islands or mainland from previous work, although some workmen near the 80 Acre site on Utila reported finding numerous pots with bones in them. The only other burial identiElcation possibly ap- plicable to the Cocal Period relates to a shell midden recorded Elrst by Spinden in 1923, and located on the north side of the Guaimoreto Lagoon.27 His ex- cavations unearthed some eight human skeletons, some of which were dismembered and located in low (earthen?) mounds. This same site appears to have been re-tested by Bird in 1931, and probably is this project's site H-CN-2:Km. 19.5, which has primarily Late Cocal remains.28 Neither Bird's excavations some four dec- ades ago, nor our 1973-76 surface survey produced any human skeletal remains and the site has been recently bulldozed for road E111.29 Subsistence Patterns There is substantial (though indirect) evidence of maize farming in NE Honduras during Cocal times. As has been noted previously, corn farming was practised during the Selin Period, if not earlier. 30 Numerous ground stone manos and metates were recovered at Rio Claro, often in refuse deposits at the edge of house mounds, occasionally still on house floors at the site. 26.

Unfortunately, faunal, molluscan and floral remains were scanty; only a few badly preserved deer (? Mazama a.) bones and badly preserved avocado (Persea ?) seed. The only shell found at the site belonged to a variety of land snail (?). These remains have been submitted for identification and analysis along with more plentiful faunal materials from other Honduran sites to the Florida State Museum of the University of Florida. The snail shells were, in some cases, of considerable size, and were found in sizeable quantities within, but not outside, site boundaries, perhaps suggesting that they were culturally introduced and utilized as a supplemen- tal food source. Although poor preservation cannot be ruled out as an explanatory factor for the paucity of flora and es- pecially fauna, the ground stone remains from H-CN- 12 point strongly toward a heavy reliance upon corn cultivation by Early Cocal times. There was only one (possible) projectile point fragment from the site and practically no animal bone (in marked contrast to other earlier settlements in Colon). Perspective and Summary Recent research at H-CN-12:Rio Claro suggests that this major prehistoric site was settled primarily in the Early Cocal Period with some evidence of continuation into the Late Cocal Period as well. There are clear in- dications of a marked change in settlement pattern from known earlier Selin Period habitations of NE Honduras. First, the Cocal settlement was considerably larger in size (85,500 sq. m. compared to 36,800 sq. m. for H- CN-4 and 66,700 sq. m. for H-CN-5; the latter pair be- ing Selin settlements). Although H-CN-12 is larger than most other identiEled Cocal sites, even these other late settlements tended to be clearly larger than Selin sites. Rio Claro is also far more structured in space utiliza- tion than any Selin sites and most Cocal settlements as well. The known sites of the Selin Period from this same region show signs of only very rough organization at best (i.e., several mounds arranged in a half or full cir- cle), and the usual impression that one gets in viewing the site mounds is that of a haphazard, helter-skelter settlement growth. This organization is in marked con- trast to Rio Claro (H-CN-12) where space seems to have been at a premium: the placement of the house mound-temple (?) and the shape and size of the mounds are far more rigidly controlled. The orderliness of the overall site layout at Rio Claro carries over into the conceptual realm of mound form. Unlike the irregularly shaped shell and earth mounds of Selin sites (such as H-CN-4 and H-CN-5), which varied considerably, one can delineate at least two very distinct consistent classes of mounds at Rio Claro: long, low habitation mounds and taller, oval-shaped construc-</page><page sequence="13">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 5, 1978 27 tions of a non-habitation nature (and very possibly cer- emonial in function). Some of these two classes of mounds can be seen to have been clustered in groups in relation to speciElc courtyard and plaza areas of the settlement (i.e., Mounds A-E around Plaza A). Also, the taller temple (?)-mounds are located centrally at the site. The site, situated atop a raised plateau in the Aguan River valley, appears to have been constructed on this prominence for its defensive nature Indeed, there is evidence of a sizeable ditch surrounding that portion of the site which would have been open and vulnerable to aboriginal (or Spanish) attack. In addition, the presence of several paved walkways leading into different parts of the site suggests the possibility of a palisade-fortifi- cation complex at Rio Claro in the Cocal Period. All of these factors of spatial organization and rigid site arrangement contrast sharply with analogous fac- tors of earlier times in NE Honduras. Our general im- pression of Rio Claro is of a site with considerably greater social order and civic control than in earlier societies of this culture region. The numerous long, low mounds at Rio Claro, almost certainly all habitation platforms for perishable pole-and-thatch long houses, point to a settlement of several hundred farming in- habitants who planted maize (and probably beans and squash) in Elelds lying just outside and below the site boundaries (and perhaps outside the site fortiElca- tions?). The floor of the rich river valley was being heavily and productively farmed in 1976 under modern cooperative and private management. Interestingly, the plateau area of the site, though cleared by us in 1975, was not chosen for cultivation. Radiocarbon dates point to a habitation primarily between 1000-1500 A.C.. These are the first absolute chronometric determinations available for the Cocal Period of NE Honduras. Previous work, particularly by Epstein, accurately predicted the temporal range based upon ceramic associations (particularly in the Bay Islands) and the stratiEled remains of the 80 Acre Site on Utila Island, just off the north coast of Honduras. The H-CN-12 radiocarbon dates now Elrmly establish the Early Cocal Period as well. These new deter- minations will enable more secure cross-temporal and cross-cultural comparisons with Mesoamerica proper and Lower Central America. The predominant ceramic remains from Rio Claro, an incised-punctate ware, are largely unlike those of western Honduras and Mesoamerica during the con- temporaneous Postclassic Period. Some broad, general similarities with the pottery of eastern Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama can be seen in design and decora- tion, but the NE Honduran style appears to be pre- dominantly a local development. The Early Cocal propensity for rather elaborate stone carving, especially elaborate legged-metates and cruder sculptures, points to possible cultural afElliations with Lower Central America. By contrast, the obsidian from Rio Claro is probably derived from Guatemala, and the distinctive Mesoamerican Plumbate ware found on both the Bay Islands and in the Trujillo vicinity, sug- gests that this region, relatively remote today, was less isolated in Pre-Columbian times and was receptive to contacts and influence from both its southern and northern cultural neighbours. Indeed, in 1502, Christopher Columbus, on his fourth and last voyage sailing from the Bay Islands to the NE Honduran mainland, encountered a large, fully loaded Native canoe which was bound, with its trader and goods, for the Yucatan Peninsula.3l A quarter cen- tury later, Hernando Cortes, conqueror of Mexico, trekked to this same region and established the settle- ment of Trujillo (the Elrst capital of Honduras). While in NE Honduras, Cortes described the various en- counters that he had with local natives.32 Importantly, he noted the striking similarity of their local dialect with the language of the Aztecs. The social organization he described EltS that of orderly petty chiefdoms. In fact, Cortes mentioned two prominent chiefdom centers that were supported by numerous smaller village holdings. The site of Rio Claro Elts not only the general description of one of these major centers, but also the speciElc details of distance from Trujillo and other known locations. Lastly, the 1500 A.C. radiocarbon de- termination lends further credence to the earlier sug- gestion that the archaeological locality of H-CN-12:Rio Claro lasted into the Late Cocal Period, and may very well be the exact site of the ethnohistoric chiefdom center named Papayeca discussed by the famed 16th Century conquistador.33 Further investigations of H- CN-12 should validate or disprove this hypothesis.
