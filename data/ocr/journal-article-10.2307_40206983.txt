<plain_text><page sequence="1">ENCOUNTER WITH FOLKLORE David Kaufman Rumsen Ohlone Folklore: Two Tales Abstract: Sadly, it often happens that languages and cultures become dormant with no written record of their existence, of how the people perceived their world, and how they described it through their folk stories. Such would have been the case of the now dormant Rumsen Ohlone lan- guage of California were it not for the tireless dedication of linguist John P. Harrington. He spent years collaborating with the last native speaker of Rumsen, Isabelle Meadows, to discuss her culture and her folk stories. Among the cultural gems that arose from these discussions are the two narratives published here. Both stories feature the trickster figure, Coyote. The first tells of a visit by a sea monster, which causes Coyote's wife to die of fright. The second describes a battle of wits between Coyote and Hum- mingbird. Both stories give us, through the original Rumsen language, insight into the culture and sense of humor of the Rumsen people, whose descendants still inhabit the central coast of California. This essay presents two narratives from Rumsen Ohlone (ISO639-3:css) oral tradition in the original Rumsen along with free English translations: "Coyote, His Wife, and Makkeweks" and "Coyote and Hummingbird." These narratives are important, not only because they have never been published in the original Rumsen, but also because they are among the few examples of connected Rumsen text, beyond a sentence or two, collected by early linguists. These narratives appear only in the unpublished handwritten notes gathered and col- lected by Alfred Kroeber and John Harrington. The latter's notes, titled "Papers of John P. Harrington," have been copied onto micro- fiche and are the source of the narratives here. 383</page><page sequence="2">384 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 45, No. 3 Rumsen and the other Ohlonean, or Costanoan,1 languages of Cali- fornia, like so many indigenous languages around the world, are now "sleeping," or dormant. The Ohlones suffered deleterious effects under the Spanish Empire's missionization, or forced politico-religious con- version. After California was admitted to the United States, indigenous peoples were dispossessed of their lands and denied state and federal recognition (Leventhal et al. 1994:297). The pronouncement by the influential anthropologist Alfred Kroeber that for all practical purposes the Costanoan group was extinct did little to help the cause of modern Ohlones in their struggle for recognition ( [Kroeber 1925] in Leventhal et al. 1994:31 1 ) . Later, while speaking as an expert witness on behalf of surviving indigenous Californians in the California claims hearings of 1955, Kroeber rescinded his earlier statement. However, Ohlones today still struggle for federal recognition despite the fact that their ancestors lived on the central coast of California for thousands of years. The name "Ohlone" is an exonym of indefinite origin. One pos- sibility is that the name originated from a village named Oljon once located along San Gregorio Creek between San Francisco and Santa Cruz. Another possibility is that the name arose from the Rumsen word for "abalone," awlon? rock-clinging mollusks lined with nacre, or mother-of-pearl, that often were gathered and traded by Ohlones. Eight Ohlone languages were spoken in what is now central Califor- nia, extending from the Carquinez Strait and San Francisco Bay Area south to Big Sur and Soledad. Rumsen, one of these eight languages, was spoken in the area now known as the coastal Monterey-Carmel re- gion as well as inland into Carmel Valley. It was the principal indigenous language spoken at the Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo, or Carmel Mission, after Spanish colonization. Rumsen's closest linguistic relative, also dormant, is Mutsun, which was once spoken in the area of San Juan Bautista northeast of Monterey. As yet, no dictionary or grammar has been published on Rumsen. The only published references on any Costanoan language are A Vocabulary or Phrase Book of the Mutsun Language ofAlta California and Grammar of the Mutsun Language, compiled by the Spanish missionary Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta in the nineteenth century, and the Grammar of Mutsun, a dissertation written by Marc Okrand in 1977.3 In the first decade of the twentieth century, Kroeber interviewed and consulted several Rumsen speakers to gather wordlists and analyze certain aspects of the grammar.4 However, John Peabody Harrington</page><page sequence="3">David Kaufman Rumsen Ohlone Folklore 385 carried out the most fieldwork on Rumsen or any other Ohlone lan- guage. Harrington was a linguist who spent much of his life gathering data on many endangered indigenous languages, especially those of California. He worked with a single-minded passion to document these dying languages, a passion expressed in a letter he wrote to an assistant in 1941: "The time will come and soon when there won't be an Indian language left in California, all the languages developed for thousands of years will be ashes, the house is afire, it is burning* (in Hin- ton 1994:197; Harrington's emphasis). Such fervor led him to be de- scribed, among other things, as an "obsessed genius," an "indefatigable field worker," and a "laughable and endearing eccentric" (p. 195) . His overzealous penchant for endless fieldwork and data collection at the expense of publishing his research notes in academic journals largely made him an academic outcast. He seldom shared his gathered data. He simply accumulated and stored stacks of notes in boxes, leaving them in various locations. Only in the last thirty years or so has much of this material been retrieved, copied onto microfiche, and made available to the outside world, primarily through the efforts of Elaine Mills, Catherine Callaghan, and the Smithsonian Institution. Harrington's primary Rumsen consultant was Isabelle Meadows.5 Meadows was born in Monterey in 1846, the daughter of an English whaler, James Meadows, and a Rumsen mother, Loreta Peralta. Mead- ows was eighty-five years old when she began working with Harrington. She agreed to accompany him to Washington D.C., where she worked with him at the Smithsonian Institution until her death in 1939. It is largely from Harrington's collaboration with Meadows that we know what we do today about Rumsen language and culture. The two stories appearing here were originally gathered by Kroeber but were later discussed by Harrington with Meadows and reproduced in his notes. The primary character in both stories is Caacakiy Maccan, or Coyote.6 Coyote is a trickster, an anthropomorphic animal who challenges traditional cultural norms and rules of behavior. While the trickster takes different forms throughout North America, such as the rabbit in the Plains and Southeast, in California and the Southwest the trickster is usually the "sly dog-like animal who skulked around the outskirts of villages, hunting gophers, scavenging the refuse piles, and occasionally stealing salmon and deer meat from the drying racks" (Margolin 1981:140). For the Ohlones, Coyote is considered the ere-</page><page sequence="4">386 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 45, No. 3 ator of the human race; he is concurrently "fool and benefactor, idiot and god" (p. 147-48) and is delightfully entertaining. Throughout California it was usually forbidden to tell Coyote tales in the summer. Doing so was believed to bring bad luck and possibly illness to both storyteller and listener. Coyote tales were told in the winter when the cold rainy season often necessitated many people living in close quarters; it was the season when social tensions built up inside houses and assembly lodges (p. 147). Perhaps Coyote tales were told at this time of year because a masterful storyteller could take "on the character of Coyote, alternately whining, pleading, posturing, importuning, or demanding. He assumes the role of other characters, he imitates and mimics, he breaks into song . . . Everyone - young and old, man and woman, rich person and poor - is laughing together" (p. 141), a great way to break the tension. The Rumsen narratives are transcribed here as they were written in Harrington's notes with my free translations into English. My transla- tions are based on my study of the Rumsen language and on the colonial California Spanish in which Harrington often wrote while working with Meadows, who frequently switched between Spanish and English. I have developed and used a modern orthography based on Americanist phonetic transcription conventions to best reflect Rumsen sounds as currently understood. I have also reflected in my orthography the spell- ing and sounds of words as analyzed by other Rumsen scholars, such as Callaghan (1988, 1992), Okrand (1979), and Shipley (1980). It should be borne in mind that these narratives are probably only fragments of longer stories. While Harrington's notes are prolific, he usually did not organize them into any coherent structure. Instead, he fre- quently wrote things down haphazardly as his consultants spoke, writing in margins and often incorporating lengthy digressions and even personal information about his consultants or their family members, neighbors, and friends. Many times it is unclear whether the stories he reheard or collected were complete or merely fragments of longer narratives. I have titled the stories according to their main characters. In the first, "Coyote, His Wife, and Makkeweks," the characters are Coyote, his wife, and a type of sea creature called Makkeweks. Coyote and his wife take a trip to the ocean. Coyote teaches his wife about the coastal animals that are her relatives, but he does not tell her about Mak-</page><page sequence="5">David Kaufman Rumsen Ohlone Folklore 387 keweks. When Makkeweks makes his appearance, she dies of fright. Then Coyote revives her with a shamanic ritual.7 1.

Then Coyote said to his wife: "Don't be afraid." Then Makkeweks scared her. Makkeweks scared her when he rose up from the water. Then the Coyote's wife fell down and she died from fright. Coyote had told her: "The sea lion and the mussel are all your uncles, so don't be afraid." But he did not tell her that Makkeweks was her uncle. When she died, then Coyote put her on his back and carried her farther away, over there where the woman wouldn't see Makkeweks again. Then Coyote lit a fire, and next he laid her down there by the fire, there close to the fire so she would get warm; and then she got warm. Then Coyote jumped while performing a shamanic ritual, then he sang, then he danced. His wife came back to life, then Coyote jumped three times, and he had his song when he was dancing. The second narrative is a good example of Coyote being "driven by obsessions, by single-minded compulsions, by relentlessly insistent urges" (Margolin 1981:154). The story reveals the rivalry between Coyote and Hummingbird. Coyote tries to kill Hummingbird several times only to be outwitted each time. Coyote is "outwit- ted and deceived in wildly variant ways throughout West-Central California" (Ortiz 1994:146). Such deceptions and tricks are often in retaliation for Coyote's bad deeds and behavior.</page><page sequence="6">388 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 45, No. 3 2.

(Harrington 1981:reel 690510-071, p. 153-56)10 Coyote thought he knew a lot, but Hummingbird got the best of him. Coyote wanted to kill Hummingbird, so Coyote grabbed Hum- mingbird and shredded him to pieces. Then Coyote left. Hum- mingbird came back to life. Then Hummingbird flew up, (jokingly) yelling, "I'm dying, I'm dying." Coyote lit a fire and grabbed Hum- mingbird again. Then he threw him there, into the fire. Then he left. Coyote was going along nearby and hadn't gone far before Humming- bird came back to life, flying up and shouting, "I'm dying, I'm dying." Then Coyote said: "How am I going to kill him?" They said to him: "You must make as if to eat him, and that is how you will kill him." So Coyote ate Hummingbird. But Hummingbird scratched and scratched the inside of Coyote's stomach. Then Coyote said, "What am I go- ing to do? I'll die, I'll die." Then they told Coyote he must defecate Hummingbird out. "Defecate him out!" Coyote did so, then Humming- bird flew up (mockingly) yelling, "I'm dying, I'm dying." I hope this essay has not only brought to attention the continuing existence of these indigenous people of coastal California but has also given insight into their traditional culture through the two folk stories presented here as told in their own language. While the Rumsen lan- guage has not been spoken in nearly seventy years, we can be grateful</page><page sequence="7">David Kaufman Rumsen Ohlone Folklore 389 to Harrington and Meadows for their tireless endeavors before the lan- guage and these stories could, like so many others, vanish forever. University of Kansas Lawrence Notes 1. While Ohlonean and Costanoan are both used, it is important to note that the Ohlones themselves prefer the term "Ohlonean" in reference to themselves. Linguistically, however, "Costanoan" is more common and thus is the term used here. 2. The English word for this large sea snail, abalone, derives from the Rumsen name (Cutler 2002:71). 3. Okrand is the linguist who later invented the Klingon language spoken in the Star Trek movies. It has been stated, jokingly or not, that some of the strange sounds Okrand invented for Klingon were based on his work with Costanoan phonetics and phonology. 4. Among Kroeber's consultants were Maria Viviena Soto, Jacinta Gonzalez, and Tom Torres. 5. Harrington's other consultants included Tom Torres, Tomasa and Flugenio Cantua, Trinidad Ranjel, Laura and Alfonso Ramirez, Maria Onesimo Ramirez, Claudia Corona, and Julia Diaz. 6. In Rumsen, caacakiy is 'wild' and maccan is 'dog.' Thus, coyote is 'wild dog,' written by Kroeber as tat-aki-matcan (Kroeber 1910:249). However, caacakiy appears to be optional and maccan alone can mean 'coyote' as well as 'dog.' 7. 1 use the term "shamanic" with the knowledge that this term is a point of con- tention among some anthropologists, because the term "shaman" is a Tungus word that technically only refers to their own spiritual practices in Siberia. But, lacking any better overall substitute, the term has been adopted to refer generally to the spiritual practices of other groups, and I use this term here in that way. 8. A note on Rumsen pronunciation: c represents a ch sound as in English 'church', § represents a retroflex s sound with tongue curled farther back in the mouth than English s, 5 represents the sh sound of English 'shoe', /represents a retroflex t sound, and the ' before words beginning with a vowel indicates a glottal stop, a consonant sound articulated with the vocal cords, the sound produced at the beginning and middle of the English uh-oh. 9. This is as it appears in Harrington's notes, indicating that the -iki past-tense suffix is subject to speaker preference or is optional in storytelling. 10. Meadows gave aayeken ('shouting') as an alternative, and she also volunteered the alternate sentence wa xoppen 'aayeknakin.</page><page sequence="8">390 Journal of Folklore Research Vol. 45, No. 3 References Cited Arroyo de la Cuesta, Felipe 1861 Grammar of the Mutsun Language, Spoken at the Mission of San Juan Bautista, Alta California.
