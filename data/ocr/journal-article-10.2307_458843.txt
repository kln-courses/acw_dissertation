<plain_text><page sequence="1">IV THEORIES OF MONARCHY IN MUM AND THE SOTHSEGGER THE literature of the estates of the world, so clearly developed in medieval France and England, was further enriched for the modern reader by the publication in 1936 of the fifteenth-century satire Mum and the Sothsegger.l Discovered in the west country, near the locale of Piers Plowman, to which it bears a number of similarities, it reviews the condi- tion of "all kinds of estates,"2 from king to peasant, in the eventful last days of Richard II and the early years of the reign of Henry IV. Though a part of the newly discovered manuscript is a fragment of alliterative verse already published3 under the title Richard the Redeles, the much larger part concerning the case of Mum and the Truthteller was unknown to modern readers and seems to have been largely neglected since its publication. The question of the relation of the two fragments is unset- tled, but since in the sixteenth century they were known as one poem under the title of Mum, Sothsegger, since their language and form are identical, and since certain ideas in the two parts are closely related,4 there is good reason for considering them here together as parts of a single poem. Many of the characteristics of the literature of estates as they are to be found in other works of this type are also found in Mum and the Soth- segger. Its classification of all society, its stress on the necessity of the three estates and on the duties of each to the others to maintain a stable realm, its indication of the faults of each class, its doctrine of love as the remedy for their shortcomings, and its use of such familiar devices as the debat, the dream vision allegory, and the narrative of journeying in search of information are all familiar from other works of the same tradi- tion. The purpose of the author in writing, however, was not simply that of following his predecessors in a more or less stereotyped literary pat- tern of enumeration and lament. He had a duty to perform for his king: that of advising him as to the nature of true monarchy, the advantages of monarchy, the authority by which monarchy stood, and the fate of monarchy if it failed in its duty of upholding the law and thus maintain- 1 Eds.

Since, before the book was completed, Richard II (king by the law of primogeniture) was deposed, and Henry IV (king by act of Parliament) had ascended the throne, the whole problem of king- ship became one of extreme importance and one about which the new king needed advice as much as his predecessor, if not more. Though Henry had been hailed as a kind of savior of the realm, the evils of Rich- ard's reign went unredressed, and added to the evils was a new kind of secrecy, that meant flattery at court and eavesdropping on the commons. Those who spoke the truth were soon put in prison, and some were put to death. In 1401 the Statute De Haeretico Comburendo was passed, to deal with those who spoke against the Church, and Lollard persecution increased. Therefore, though the author of Mum and the Sothsegger had begun his book boldly, with an occasional bit of beast or bird allegory, all pretty obvious to those at court, he proceeded with more caution, under cover of pretended ignorance, to a narrative of a ten-year search for truth among all the estates of the realm, and a more extended dream vision allegory. The political theory of the author did not change, however, with the change of kings. No doubt the deposition and death of Richard and the presence of the much-lauded Bolingbroke on the throne only strengthened his faith in his doctrine concerning kingship in general. In the latter, more cautious part of his book he adds the very lively and significant theme, derived from the words of Christ himself and supported by both classical and medieval authority, that he who is silent about the evils of the realm consents to them and is as guilty as the doer; but this addition, likewise, has no effect on his political doctrine, and is, in fact, a clever means of justifying his earlier boldness as well as his later more guarded, but no less pointed, criticism. What, then, were the chief theories of monarchy as set forth by this philosopher-poet in the late fourteenth century and early fifteenth cen- tury, at a time so significant for the future political history of England? Was he, in the light of political theory of his own day, a conservative or a liberal? To what other medieval political theorists was he most nearly related? And from what evidence did he and his contemporaries or pre- decessors derive their conclusions? Needless to say, the study of these fourteenth- and fifteenth-century theories of monarchy sheds light on all succeeding theory; and the student of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century political literature is hard pressed to understand the problems of tenure and divine right in those times without some understanding of the chief political theories of the Middle Ages. Had Mum and the Sothsegger been written in the thirteenth or early fourteenth century, it might have had something to say of the conflicts between Papacy and Empire and between Empire and National Mon- 27</page><page sequence="3">Monarchy in "Mum and the Sothsegger" archy. In those times the genuinely medieval theorist, imbued with the medieval passion for unity, began with a single God-State, divinely founded and comprising every human community, whether village, city, province, or kingdom, in a kind of federalistic system.6 To Dante,6 as to John of Salisbury7 and others, the term monarchy meant a single world empire, and the monarch or princeps was emperor, not king. By the end of the fourteenth century, however, the decline of the power of Papacy and Empire and the growing power of national monarchies, accelerated by the doctrines of the ancients, marked the supremacy of the idea of nationalism, rather than imperialism, especially in England, France, and Spain. Consequently the author of Mum has nothing to say of those larger aspects of medieval political theory, but confines his argument to the theories of national monarchy alone. He is a nationalist, caring little about the claims of Empire or Papacy. Writing after the time of such new and liberal thinkers as Marsilius of Padua and William of Ockham, he is moreover, a nationalist whose faith, like theirs, is fixed in monarchy limited by a sovereignty of the people, evolved according to Natural Law and maintained by representation and by due process of law. Such earlier theorists as Thomas Aquinas8 and Aegidius Colonna were favorable to national or even city monarchy, and to national monarchy limited by obligations of duty, but they would scarcely have understood the limita- tions imposed by the "decisively republican"9 theorists of the later fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, as well as by the author of Mum in his book of government.'0 To Marsilius of Padua and to William of Ockham 6 Otto von Gierke, Political Theories of the Middle Age, transl. with intro. by Frederic W.

Though the author of Mum has no thought for the conflicts of Empire and Papacy, he is, like the theorists of his own day, fully aware of the problems involved in the institution of national monarchy if it is to sur- vive. The conflicts of his own day are, briefly: the doctrine of monarchy as opposed to that of feudalism; the doctrine of monarchy instituted by popular sovereignty and maintained by due process of law as opposed to lawless absolutism; the theory of passive obedience as opposed to that of resistance and even tyrannicide; and finally the distinctive and some- times divergent claims of Positive and Natural Law. In his consideration of these problems, the author of Mum is always the practical legist, with one eye on theory and the other on the law and the courts. His emphasis on the law is everywhere apparent.12 In that emphasis, as well as in his nationalism, especially as he applies it with deference to the ancients and their faith in law, always tested by the dic- tates of reason, he looks forward to the advent of the modern era rather than backward to medieval theories of divine ordination and divine right, incapable of legal limitation beyond the demands of Natural Law. Like the thirteenth-century English jurist Henry de Bracton, with whose De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae he was no doubt familiar, he recog- nizes the reasonableness of Roman law, consciously revived in the Uni- versity of Bologna and elsewhere in the twelfth century and taught at Oxford and Cambridge in spite of protests, such as those of Wycliffe,13 that English customary law was superior and should not be supplanted by Roman or "Civil" Law as the folk-law of other nations had been sup- planted on the Continent. The author of Mum in one instance cites Roman Law as a standard in his criticism of English case law.14 However, also like Bracton, he is obviously most familiar with English case law, and in his listing of the faults of all estates as found in a bag full of books 11 Marsilius of Padua, Defensor Pacis, ed. C. W. Previt&amp;-Orton (Cambridge [Eng.]: University Press, 1928), p. 89. 12 In this respect, also, he is like Marsilius of Padua, whose "demonstration... is chiefly legal." C. W.

Pollard and Charles Sayle (London: Triibner &amp; Co., 1887), pp. 189-193. Wycliffe's objections are that Roman Civil Law is an obstacle to theology, that all that is true in Roman Law is found in the Scriptures, that Roman Law permits many things contrary to religion. As for the argument that Roman Law is superior to English Law he says: "Sed non credo quod plus viget in Romana civilitate subtilitas racionis sive iusticia quam in civilitate Anglicana." 14 P. 74, 11. 1619-20, 1624-25. 29</page><page sequence="5">Monarchy in "Mum and the Sothsegger" at the close of Fragment M, he seems to be writing with a lawyer's note- book or a group of plea rolls before him. The reader of Mum is naturally prone to speculate as to whether the author may have been a member of one of the Inns of Court and perhaps also a member of Parliament, since he knows so much about the affairs of the realm. It was the medieval English schools of law, the Inns of Court, and the Yearbooks of recorded cases read in those schools that prevented the invasion of Roman law and preserved English common law, both in the Middle Ages and later in the days of the Stuarts.15 It is possible that the author of Mum was one of those common lawyers who thus helped to preserve the traditions of liberty which are the glory of English common law and which we in America have inherited. Above all, however, as one who, like most medieval theorists, reveres the Gospel as the source of all law,'6 the author of Mum is aware, as we shall see later, of the primary authority of God's law or Natural Law in all cases and all courts. Whether the author of Mum knew Aristotle and his Politics or any other political theory of the ancients at first hand is impossible to say, since he nowhere names any "learned" sources. However, the republican- ism of Aristotle, familiar, like Roman Law, since the latter half of the twelfth century, gradually permeated medieval doctrine, and there is every reason to suppose that the author of Mum was aware of such the- ory, whether from ancient sources directly or from such theorists as Wi- liam of Ockam and Marsilius of Padua, to whom, as to Aristotle, no one form of government was more "divine" than another. Nor is it strange that the author of Mum should espouse the ancient theory of the natu- ral, rational evolution of law and government since, as an English legist, he knew that English case law had slowly evolved from English custom- ary or common law, and that in no sense had it been the result of divine imposition or special dispensation. Thus he has little to say of govern- ment as iure divino, but treats it rather as the outgrowth of practical necessity and fitness and reason. From his knowledge of law and of English politics past and present, the author of Mum has come to a firm belief in monarchy as the best form of national government, and in this, as we have seen, he is in accord with other medieval theorists.'7 His chief reason for such preference, however, 16 "Common Law," Encyclopedia Britannica, 14th ed. (1937), vI, 123. For a discussion of "The Influence of Roman Law in England" see James Brown Scott, op. cit., I, 252-264. 16 P. 74, 1. 1622. 17 Cf. Otto von Gierke, op. cit., pp. 30 ff. Though Wycliffe believes that the best form of government in theory is a rule by judges and by divine law alone, as in Old Testament days, he, too, says that in practice monarchy is best, for almost every reason: it is ap- proved by God, by reason, and by philosophy; the Body Politic must have one Head; Aristotle thought monarchy best, and so did Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory. De Civili 30</page><page sequence="6">Ruth Mohl is that it is the form best able to cope with feudalism. Everyone knows, he says, that "it is holsum forto have a heede of us alle, That is a king y-corouned to kepe us under lawe, To put us into prisone when we passe boundes."l8 If there were no such head, the reckless lords would "renne on eche oper."'9 Neither Richard II nor Henry IV had proved the real benefits of monarchy, for Richard was ruled by his feudal barons, the worst element among them, and Henry had trouble with his liege lords from the start. The essential doctrine of feudalism, that of "the infinite divisibility of sovereign power,"20 had undermined the authority of the crown. "Full prevyly pey pluckud py power awey,"21 he asserts in his warning to Richard, until the "crown was cracked,"22 the people alienated, and the realm in a state of complete disorder. Raising his voice, therefore, against what to him was the chief evil of the day, the author of Mum denounces again and again the encroachments of the lords on the power of the king. He blames Richard not only for permitting such encroachments, but also for encouraging them by his dispersal of crown rights and revenues among his barons, his putting his seal of authority upon them in the form of royal badges, and his sanction of their authority, even in courts of law. Henry IV is a man of virtues, and he has good councillors, but he is in danger of giving them too much power and also of dividing his revenues so that he has no funds for the things it is his duty to perform. Such favoring of one estate of the realm to the exclusion of another causes grumbling and defection among the commons, who, if dealt with justly, according to the law, would love their king as subjects ought to do. That the author's fears of feudalism were not groundless was proved some fifty years later by the growing friction between Yorkists and Lancastrians and finally by the Wars of the Roses -a period of lawlessness and disorder which was resolved only when Tudor might was able to make of monarchy a power that was more than a match for ambitious barons. In support of his faith in monarchy the author of Mum twice uses the figure of the Body Politic,23 so familiar in medieval political doctrine, from that of John of Salisbury24 in the twelfth century to its fullest use Dominio, ed.

The importance of the head to the body is naturally his theme in using this anthropomorphic comparison. By means of it he first stresses the ill effects suffered by all members of the body if the head is injured; and later he warns some of the commons, who are the hands of the body, of the danger to the head and to themselves in indiscriminate criticism of the king. The doctrine of monarchy is also enforced by the author's use of a bit of medieval science, that of bee-keeping. In a dream vision he learns about the government of bees from a wise old gardener, who, in a sense, is also a symbol of good government, for he keeps his garden according to "the law," namely, that of destroying everything that injures it and pro- tecting everything that is good. The bee, says the gardener, is the best governed of all creatures and is therefore a worthy teacher. Bees choose as king26 one who is fit "by kinde"27 to wear the crown. He is the most merciful and the gentlest of all of them. He rules by reason and just laws and by consent of all the rest.28 This good king the rest all serve and obey and protect, princes and workers alike. Thus they live and work together, for the "comune profit"29-all but the drones, who are finally detected and killed. A wise tale, the author replies, with much meaning for who- ever can meditate. Similarly, in his defense of monarchy, the author turns, as did most medieval political theorists, to the aid of medieval history. There he finds the tale of Jhengiz Khan,30 who, when asked to unite seven warring princes under a single head, did so to the benefit of all. To test their loyalty, "as cronicle of hym telleth,"a3 he established two statutes: the first that they slay their eldest sons and heirs, and the second that they give to him all their lands forever; and they did his bidding. Then he called knights and others to a council, and they "wroughte alle with oon wil as wise men shuld,"32 and so prospered greatly.

Meiner, 1939), Book I. 26 The author of Mum, using Bartholomew the Englishman's Bestiary as his source, translates rex as "king" instead of "queen," apparently in a generic sense for "ruler." This argument for monarchy, as well as other arguments drawn from natural phenomena, is a common one. Cf. Thomas Aquinas, De Regimine Principum, transl. G. B. Phelan, pp. 40-42. In Shakespeare's Henry V, I, ii, 187-204, the lesson of the bees is drawn again, and the bees' ruler is called a "king." 27 P. 56, 1. 999. 28 P. 57, 11. 1036-37. 29 P. 58, 1. 1078. The reason for government is often discussed in medieval political theory. To John of Salisbury it is "aequitas" or "iustitia." To Marsilius of Padua it is "vita sufficiens." To William of Ockham it is, as here, the "utilitas communis." To Thomas Aquinas it is "unity," "order," "peace," "delight in prosperity." 30 P. 68,1. 1413 to p. 69,1. 1456.

Had the author of Mum argued simply for national monarchy, as op- posed to feudalism, there would be little to distinguish his theories from those of most medieval defenders of monarchy. Earlier theorists, as we have seen, agreed as to their preference for the rule of One Head, whether national or imperial, and they did so on the basis of God's approval, or from evidence from natural phenomena, or on the authority of the Scriptures, the Church Fathers, and the ancients, or from evidence found in the tales of medieval historians and scientists, or, in fact, on the basis of almost any source available.33 To most of these earlier theorists, more- over, the monarch became a kind of exalted being, "aliquod unum quod non est pars,"34 the "divinae maiestatis imago,"35 whose "omnis potestas a Domino Deo est."36 Just a century before Mum and the Sothsegger the theory that kings ruled by divine right was set forth in France by Raoul of Praelles and John of Paris in defense of Philip the Fair against Boniface VIII. In England Wycliffe was among the first to stress the divine right theory, with his famous doctrine of dominion as founded in grace.37 And in his interpretation of the theory he added the important doctrine that the king, who is king by virtue of his preeminent righteousness, may be said to be above human law, since he is lawmaker for his people.38 How- ever, since his duty is to decree just laws,39 made in conformity with God's law,40 and to set a good example by obeying them,41 he may also be said to be subject to his own law by virtue of the commands of divine law, though not by those of his own law.42 But to Wycliffe every righteous man was a lord, so that actually his theory of dominion, establishing a direct relation between man and God, threatened to sweep away both civil rule and priesthood and hence was an ideal only. To most of these earlier theorists the king is the lawmaker, not the people or their repre- sentatives. The medieval Church doctrine that the Fall of Man termi- 33 Cf.

As repre- sentatives of God on earth, kings were declared to be responsible for the safety and welfare of their subjects, and in return they should receive the love and obedience of their subjects.43 If the king proved a tyrant, it was thought best to endure him, if possible, lest a worse one appear; but if he became unbearable, the community might proceed against him, not by private means, but by public authority. Such a king, set up by the people, might justly be destroyed by the people or his power be re- stricted,44 since the good of the multitude is greater and more divine than the good of one man.45 With some of the theories of these earlier writers about monarchy the author of Mum is plainly in agreement. Though he has little to say of Richard's or Henry's being God's representative on earth, ruling by divine right or because of preeminent goodness, and prefers to rest his defense of monarchy on reason and the practical need for unity, he, too, says that the king's chief duty is to maintain law and order, just as surely as it is the duty of unlearned men to labor at their plows;46 that in return for his care for the safety and welfare of his subjects the king should re- ceive their love and allegiance;47 but that if the king should fail in his duty of maintaining law and order and the common welfare, he might be deposed, as Richard had been, and another monarch be chosen, more fit "by kynde," to protect them.48 The theory of an indefeasible hereditary right to the throne was still not fixed and was not fixed in England until the defeat of the House of Lancaster in the Wars of the Roses established the succession by primogeniture rather than by act of Parliament. Later, in the days of the Stuarts, that theory was to be the first tenet in their theory of divine right. In several important respects, however, the author of Mum is plainly not in accord with these earlier theorists. His monarch is one who rules by a kind of contractual agreement with the people, who is not lawmaker but enforcer of the law made by the representatives of the people, and who is, like the people, subject to the law. In these beliefs he is much more like such democratic theorists as William of Ockham, Marsilius of Padua, and Nicholas of Cusa, who, in their insistence on the rights of the 43 Cf.

The following chapter headings are especially significant: II, cap. viii-"Quod auc- toritas in conciliis non dependet a capite concilii, sed communi omnium consensu"; II, cap. xiv-"Quod omnis constitutio ex radice naturalis iuris locum habet, et quod omnis 35</page><page sequence="11">Monarchy in "Mum and the Sothsegger" The author of Mum and the Sothsegger, having seen the deposition of one monarch, who reigned by hereditary right, and the election of an- other by act of Commons and Lords, seems to have no doubt of the contractual relation between king and people and of the legislative capacity of the representatives of the people in Parliament assembled and of the duty of the king to abide by and enforce all the laws of the realm.59 However, his purpose is to warn both king and realm that these functions of government are not operating as they should. In the first place, the representatives of the people in Parliament assembled are not truly representing the people, for in Richard's day Parliaments were packed with Richard's yes-men,60 and in Henry's reign the representa- tives sent to Parliament for the express purpose of setting forth the people's grievances are silent for fear of what may happen to them.6' Secondly, the king is not enforcing the laws. And finally, as a result of the king's failure to enforce the laws, the courts of law are full of bribery and deceit.62 The failure of Parliament to provide the necessary statutes for reform, the failure of the king to enforce the laws, and the failure of the courts to proceed honestly and justly-all these conditions destroy respect for law and government and so threaten the monarchy itself. Of what use are laws without enforcement?63 And surely the greatest boon on earth is just laws concerning the management of revenues.64 If Richard and Henry had only maintained the court revenues according to law, they would not have had to demand subsidies from Parliament or collect taxes without Parliament's authorization, such as those on im- ports and exports and personal property and the cloth at the fairs, or coerctio, cum natura aeque liberi simus, ex electione et consensu subiectorum sit"; n, cap. xix-"Quod libertas electionis est radix, per quam omnis ordinata potestas consti- tuitur"; and IIr, cap. xii-"Quod rex aut princeps leges et statuta generalia provinciam respicientia in generalibus utriusque status sui regni conciliis per consensum edere habet et illa salva epikeia exequi et defensare, et quod cotidianum concilium de electis ex tota provincia subiecta de consensu universalis sui concilii habere debeat." 59 A good idea of the degree of democracy achieved in representation in Parliament in the fifteenth century may be secured from the History of Parliament.

Since elections were mainly by acclamation and there was "no scrutiny of a man's right to shout," (p. xlvii); since every kind of trade except soap boilers had members sitting in Parliament (p. xxxvi); and since Parliament was a place where Ministers and people mingled informally on equal terms, while they told each other their grievances (p. v), it would seem that representation had a pretty impor- tant place in the government-unless it was interfered with by bribery. 60 P. 24, 1. 20 to p. 26, 1. 93. 61 P. 60, 11. 1129-40.

In this connection it should be pointed out that the sympathy of the author of Mum throughout his advice on good government is with the poor. Though Mum and the Sothsegger seems in one instance unsym- pathetic,65 the contrary is true. In that one instance, near the close of the second fragment,66 the author chides those of the commons who igno- rantly criticize the king's government and make false statements about it as indulging in conduct against Natural Law;67 but he hastens to add that he is not speaking of their representatives, whose duty it is, in Parliament and in the king's Council, to set forth the wrongs of the realm.68 In the very place provided for such discussion, the representa- tives of the people are silent. Nevertheless, the poor who spread lies about the king and lords gain nothing but resentment, and in the end they stir up mean thoughts among the rest of the commons and even turn the lords from their duty of defending the realm. Thus all suffer, commons as well as lords. To offset this one charge that the author of Mum makes against some of the commons, he repeatedly urges the cause of "the poor." It is they who suffer most from poor government. The lords and the clergy have taken care of themselves very well, but the poor commons are everywhere set upon and deserve the king's protection first and foremost. In at least thirty instances the author speaks of the plundering of the poor by the king's tax-collectors, by the king's judges and justices, by lawyers, by the clergy, by town officials, by the lesser gentry, and by the lords. Moreover, the poor have a multitude of truth- tellers who are constantly telling them their faults, whereas their su- periors have none. If the author of Mum charges some of the commons with harmful gossiping, it is in a spirit of concern for the welfare of all estates, including the commons, that he does so, rather than with "con- tempt."69 May "harde happes" fall on those who so injure Henry or any lord of the land "pat loveth pees and reste,"70 he says, and the last phrase is significant, for not all the lords did so love peace and rest. At the same time, he praises the truthteller, of whatever rank he may be, provided only that he know the truth and tell it for the good of the king and his people: "But if God have grauntyd pe / grace for to knowe ony manere mysscheff / pat m3tte be amendyd, Schewe pat to pi sovereyne / to schelde him from harmes."71 By such truthtellers the people should be 65 See eds.' intro., p. xvi. 66 P. 67,11. 1389-1488. 67 P. 69,11. 1457-59. 68 P. 69, 1. 1460. 69 Eds'. intro., p. xvi. 70 P. 67, 1. 1405 to p. 68, 1. 1406. 71 P. 9, 11. 72-75. 37</page><page sequence="13">Monarchy in "Mum and the Sothsegger" represented in Parliament and Council and in courts of law, so that they would have no need to grumble and falsify and thus destroy the necessary loyalty among all estates. As in Piers Plowman, the commons in Mum also have a very definite and important part in the government, and as a legist rather than a religious allegorist the author of Mum makes clear that the real power of the people lies in their representation in Parliament and not in malicious gossip and disloyalty. In all his discussion of the duties of the king as ruler of his people, the author of Mum never forgets to stress similarly the duties of the people to their king. Strangely enough, though it was against feudalism, with its troubleome division of power, that the author of Mum chiefly con- tended, it was to the nature of the feudal relation that the theory of con- tract between monarch and people partly owed its acceptance and de- velopment.72 Even the author of Mum speaks of the relation between people and monarch in terms that savor of feudalism. Instead of several lords, however, the realm now has one. To him all owe allegiance-nobles, clergy, and commons. The author himself is well aware of his own duty of allegiance. For example, he pitied Richard until Christ required it no longer,73 and as a liege to his lord, he served Richard loyally while he reigned.74 Not only his body and his beasts belong to his king, but also his good counsel.75 To Henry, too, he owes allegiance and counsel.76 All the people, likewise, owe allegiance and love. Allegiance without love avails little.77 Thus the feudal doctrine of love between estates is applied to the relation of people to monarch. The author's doctrine of popular sovereignty and the contractual rela- tion between people and monarch, like his doctrine of the necessity of a single Head, is enforced by: (1) his references to the Body Politic and the effect each member has on all the rest; (2) the gardener's account of the good government of the bee "king," who rules through agreement of the company that unites all in one; and (3) the example of Jhengiz Khan, who called a council of representatives and worked with them as wise men should, to restore the realm. Since, to the author of Mum, a monarchy limited by such contractual relationship between king and people is the only true monarchy, and since the contractual relationship can be maintained only by due process of law, it is in this matter of the law that the author of Mum makes some of his most serious charges and offers his most helpful advice to the king. 72 Cf.

Richard led his own life law- lessly,78 and it is best for Henry, king by Parliamentary title, to re- member that the people will "love you for pe lawe,"79 lest marvels befall him, too-probably deposition-within a few years.80 Nor is the author of Mum concerned only with English case law in his denunciations of lawless rule. Like all medieval political theorists he makes the distinction between man-made or Positive Law and God-made or Natural Law.81 The idea of Natural Law, sometimes also called the lus Divinum from the theologian's point of view or the lus Commune Gentium from the point of view of the classicist, is a matter somewhat difficult for modern readers to understand, but it is essential to interpre- tation of medieval literature of political import. To the modern reader, familiar with one kind of law, derived from legislative statutes and court decisions, another legal standard, above such man-made law, more exalted and more binding, is something of an anomaly. Nevertheless, in the Middle Ages Natural Law was the most valid law. It was recognized by courts and justices and was binding on all, sovereign and subject alike. Since God, not the State, was the source of all law, Natural Law was thought of as part of the world-order from the beginning and as un- changeable. This Natural Law was therefore very old law and also good law, and when a case arose in court which no man-made law would cover, a new law was made with the idea that the new law was simply man's expression of the good old law, implicit in life itself. Thus law-makers, both courts and legislative bodies alike, did not create law, but dis- covered the old and gave it clarity and force by putting it into the form of Positive Law.82 Protected by Natural Law, any subject might theoreti- cally question in court an act of government which to him seemed un- lawful or unjust and obtain redress on the basis of what he considered his just rights, whether petty or important.83 Today a plaintiff's idea of what 78 P. 3, 11. 12-13. 79 P. 27, 1. 26. 80 P. 34,11. 221-222. 81 Cf.

By the modern reader, the medie- val conception of Natural Law would probably be described as the "right" or the "ethical" or the "honest" thing to do, but not as neces- sarily the legal thing to do. Nevertheless, the medieval idea of the impor- tance of Natural Law to Positive Law has never been lost, and earnest pleas for the constant reincorporation of that law in modern man-made law are familiar to modern legists.84 The problem of the medieval legist was still further complicated by the distinction between Roman law, the Corpus Juris Civilis of Justinian, and the ancient customary law of such countries as were not subjugated by Rome. Although in England, as we have seen, English common law was preserved when Roman law threatened to replace it, in the twelfth century and later, most of the countries of Europe, including Scotland, adopted or "received" Roman civil law, and it became the legal standard for a large part of Europe. Legists in other countries as well, including England, fascinated by the reasonableness and clarity of Roman law, assumed that it might be and should be used as supplementary to the law of national custom. Especially did they urge such use because a large part of Roman law, and the most useful part, seemed to claim to be the law of no one nation, but of all nations and all men, a kind of Law of Nature, and so, to Christians, a Law of God.85 Nor were the Italian legists slow to urge its universality. Thus the medieval conception of Natural Law, derived from the Greeks86 and most thoroughly defined by Thomas Aquinas,87 was gradually supplemented and strengthened by the legists' knowledge of Roman law or the lus Civile; and what to the modern reader may seem to have been merely ethical theory became more and more fixed as a legal standard. 84 For an interesting discussion of the "Law of Nature in the Modern World" see James Brown Scott, op. cit., I, 264-270, and James Bryce, op. cit., pp. 597-606. See also the plea of Otto von Gierke for the necessary union of Natural and Positive Law in Natural Law and the Theory of Society, Appendix ia, pp. 223-226. The beneficial effects of the concept of Natural Law in medieval political theory are discussed by Ewart Lewis, "Na- tural Law and Expediency in Medieval Political Theory," Ethics, I, no. 2 (1940), 144-163: "But, whatever the extent of its influence, the appeal to natural law certainly helped to break the sway of irrational custom and tradition over the medieval mind and to substi- tute the sovereignty of reason and utility.... And if such a natural law is to have any usefulness as 'a sort of rule or measure' in our swiftly moving world, I suggest that it might well follow the pattern of natural law in medieval theory: affirming inviolable ends for mankind but allowing the utmost flexibility in the choice of means" (pp. 162-163). 85 "Ius naturale est quod natura, id est ipse deus docuit omnia naturalia," says Henry de Bracton, Bracton de Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae, ed. Woodbine, ii, 26. 86 Otto von Gierke, Natural Law and the Theory of Society, intro., pp. xxxiv-xxxvi. 87 Opera Omnia (Rome: Ex Typographia Polyglotta S.

He should know the law of the Church as well, especially in so far as it related to civil rights and duties. Violations of Canon Law concerning civil matters might even be tried in civil courts, but the law itself was the will of the Church, and hence other distinctions crept in which further complicated enforcement. Against such a background of legal distinctions the author of Mum shows his king how the law has been violated and what must be done to provide justice and sound government. Concerning the dignity and authority of the law itself he has little doubt; his charge is the lack of enforcement by courts and king alike. When he complains of some wrongs done, he does so to suggest the need of new laws to cover such cases. In one instance only, I believe, does he criticize the law itself. On that occasion he finds fault with the English law that permits a man to bring suit whenever he sees fit. As a result, the courts are burdened with unnecessary and foolish cases. Civil law, he says, does not approve; and by Civil Law, as we have seen, he means Roman law, which has come to be considered as Natural Law or the Ius Commune Gentium: But civile seith us not so / pat serveth for al peuple That habiteth undre hevene / hethen men and oper.88 And Canon Law and the Gospel are against it: and Crist-is lawe-is y-canonized canon, yf pou loke, And eeke pe glorious gospelle / grounde of alle lawes.89 Consequently, he says, he has never been able to persuade himself that the English law is not out of line in this respect: For in my conscience ne in my credo yit couthe I never vele But pat oure lawe leneth pere a lite, as me penketh.90 He knows, too, how the law can be made a subterfuge, to cover and color the tricks of these habitual litigants,9l but such malpractice is the fault of the court and not of the law itself. In speaking of the requirements of Natural Law, the author usually labels them as being "according to nature" or "against nature" or a "natural cause." For example, unless the crown "in his kinde"92 have his revenues restored to him, no one will prosper. And when the author con- demns the outrages committed by Richard's evil councillors against the 88 P. 74, 11. 1619-20. 91 P. 73, 1. 1592. 89 p. 74,11. 1621-22. 92 P. 75,1. 1675. 90 P. 74, 11. 1624-25. 41</page><page sequence="17">Monarchy in "Mum and the Sothsegger" wise courtiers of the realm, he recites what is evidently a law to him, namely, that the greatest misdeed on earth is that done "a3eins kynde."93 Similarly he says that there is no "kindely cause"94 why the commons should oppose or criticize the king. Bolingbroke, the Eagle, has been chosen as king because he was "heed of hem all / and hieste of kynde,"95 just as the bees also chose their king "by kinde."96 In addition to such direct references to the law of "kinde," the author cites the dictates of Natural Law as those of "reason"97 and "wisdom" and "pure necessity." Reason says: that it is best to have one ruler;98 that it is not for a subject to annoy his king in deed or word,99 though he may offer good counsel if he has it;100 and that each estate should perform its own work in the realm.101 A third method of indicating the dictates of Natural Law is that of speaking of the "duties" of king and subjects, or of what they "should" do if they are to do what is right. In this sense, the author falls into the parlance of other literature of estates and of the doctrines of feudal society. When he says that "who so loketh on pe lawe may lerne, yf hym like, Thayre ordre and office / and how pay [ought] wyrche,"102 it is of the law of natural duty that he speaks, rather than of any court decision or legislative action, and hence in the next few lines it is in a chronicle of clerks' and kings' lines that he finds his evidence for belief that clergy and knighthood especially are no longer what they were in the days of their forefathers. The duty of the king, to study law and keep order, the duty of the lords to defend the realm, the duty of the clergy to serve as spiritual "lanterns"103 for men to live by, and the duty of the commons to labor for the rest are all cited as matters of common understanding, as "Crist dide paym stable,"'04 rather than anything that needs to be proved or disproved in a court of law. Nevertheless, as a result of such common understanding of the re- quirements of Natural Law, which no one, whether king or subjects, may escape, some definite laws have been devised, by human agencies, and so the author has much to say about Positive Law, as it is administered or violated in the courts. His references to Positive Law, or the laws established by court precedent and legislation, concern three main sub- jects: taxation, the administration of justice, and representation in Parliament. Richard and his councillors violated the laws of all those three phases of government by forcibly collecting unauthorized taxes, 93 P. 13, 1. 10. 94 P. 69,1. 1458.

In Henry's reign the disorders continue, and the laws go unenforced. Especially do the injustices of court practice and the loss of the king's revenues concern the author of Mum in Henry's reign. Not-withstanding statutz ful strattely y-made To stable many statutz and strong lawes make,?10 Henry's greedy councillors and also the bishops, the "lordz y-lettred of oone lawe and oper,"l06 that is, in both Canon and Civil Law, rob him of his revenues. As a result, the commons are still plundered, and the king must live on his laborers, a thing that "may not long endure."'07 Whereas in Richard's reign brawlers wearing the king's badge upset all court procedure and administered the law with swords and clubs, the courts in Henry's reign administer justice according to the bribes they receive.'08 The poor, lacking such fees, lose all the suits they bring. The lords bribe the lawyers to deceive men and break agreements made by friendly settlement. The lords, by threat of loss of pay and employment, force their squires to testify for them, no matter where justice or the truth lies. People are bribed to shove and create disorder at the assizes so that the poor householder who is being sued loses his very house. It is better for a poor man, sued by his superior, to lose the suit than to be sued repeatedly and finally lose everything. Lords contend against each other endlessly to save their hurt pride, though they would win more respect if it were known that they refused to go to law without good cause. Such legal disorders could be ended if everyone bringing suit needlessly were fined and if the costs of the suit must be paid as soon as the case ended. The king's failure to enforce the law can have only one result: the loss of the allegiance of the people; and the loss of the alle- giance of the people may mean the end of monarchy; for how can the king himself contend with the "great ones" if the people have deserted him? Meanwhile the monarchy is weakened also by the violations, by both priests and prelates, of the Canon Law. They violate the law of tithes by keeping all of them for themselves. Though "lewed and lettrid ful lite,"109 the author of Mum himself can cite the law about tithes in only three lines and not a letter more: Give God's third to God's people, the poor; keep one third for your own sustenance; and use one third for the up- keep of the Church."o Surely the clergy should be able to remember so short a law.

They live luxuriously and spend on mistresses what should go to the poor and the sick.l12 They take bribes for permitting other men to have mistresses, and then have to lie about it, "for lawe was hit never."113 The Archdeacon, for bribes, condones the errors and im- morality of his priests and parsons, who thus so weaken the authority of Canon Law that ignorant men, following their example, break the Ten Commandments. Of the violations of Canon Law concerning the pro- bating of wills the authors of Mum is also informed. When the will has been validated by the seal of the bishop's registry and all the fees paid, the clerks toss it into a chest lest it be copied and executed. Though the will may bequeath a fifteenth of the estate to charity, one receipt only is given, and the executors never execute the will, but keep all the property for themselves. The appearance of Mum to the author in bishop's mitre raises the question of whether the author of Mum himself may not have been warned by the clergy for his attacks on such violations of Canon Law.114 What is perhaps most significant about Mum and the Sothsegger is that, in the midst of such far-reaching constitutional changes as were achieved in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries in England, it was pos- sible for this poet-legist to think and write about law and make distinc- tions and suggest practical changes and, above all, to sense the impor- tance to monarchy, if it was to survive, of a lawful rule through recogni- tion of the powers of Parliament. In so far as he was able, like Marsilius of Padua and William of Ockham, to sense the dangers of monarchy absolute and unchecked by the will of the people and to set forth the advantages of a monarchy so limited, as the prematurely constitutional reign of Henry IV promised to provide them, the author of Mum was liberal and forward-looking. Indeed he says of his book of government that he writes "Of maters pat I thenke / to meve for pe best For kyngis and kayseris comynge here-after.""' On the other hand, in an age when Lollard zeal for reform brought renewed hangings and burnings, the author of Mum seems calmly conservative. Nevertheless, his theories of monarchy were those of the medieval theorists who looked forward to the modern democratic state rather than backward to the days of feudal and monarchical tyranny.
