<plain_text><page sequence="1">Human Nature in Its Psychological Dimensions* MELFORD E. SPIRO University of Connecticut INTRODUCTION IF BY "nature" is meant the "essential character . .. of a particular thing" ("Nature," in Webster International Dictionary) then a concept of human nature must satisfy two criteria: It must designate a class, human, on the basis of those "essential character(s)" common to the members of the class; and it must distinguish this class from the class, infrahuman, whose members do not share these "essential character(s)." Psychology and anthropology have arrived at peculiarly different conclu- sions with respect to the possibility of such a classification. While asserting the existence of a nature common to all humans, psychology has questioned the existence of "essential" differences between humans and infrahumans. Anthropology, on the contrary, has distinguished humans from infrahumans, but has entertained serious doubts concerning "essential character(s)" universal among humans. In short, both disciplines have tended to deny the existence of a generic human nature. An examination of the psychological dimensions of human nature must come to terms with these two positions. THE IMAGE OF MAN IN TRADITIONAL PSYCHOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY Infrahuman animals have constituted the favorite subjects for research in experimental psychology. The use of these animals is dictated, of course, by many reasons of expediency and ease of experimentation. But the application of principles derived from infrahuman behavior to human behavior is based on a fundamental methodological postulate of experimental psychology, namely: the behavior of all mammals, if not of all animals, is governed by identical laws. This is what Murray has designated as "the audacious assump- tion of species equivalence" (p. 435). Psychologists as different as Tolman and Lashley are united on this point. Tolman, who has been one of the most effective critics of a simplistic Stimulus- Response psychology and a brilliant contributor to "field theory," neverthe- less writes; I believe that everything important in psychology (except perhaps such matters as the building up of the superego, that is, everything save such matters as involve soci- ety and words) can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice point in a maze [p. 34]. But the immediate anthropological retort would be: is there anything in human psychology, or behavior, that does not "involve society and words"? Lashley adopts a more extreme position. In an intriguing paper on the ex- * This paper, with some minor changes, was read before the 1952 meetings of the American Anthropological Association, as part of the Symposium on Human Nature. 19</page><page sequence="2">20 A merican Anthropologist [56, 1954 perimental analysis of instinctive behavior he proposes the postulate of inter- phylum equivalence. Describing the microstoma, Lashley reports that this tiny marine worm has no stinging cells of its own, but ingests hydras, which do have such cells, until sated; thus, it acquires all the nettles it needs for its protection. Involved in this process, he writes, is a: specific drive or appetite, satisfied only by a very indirect series of activities, with the satisfaction of the appetite dependent upon concentration of nettles in the skin. [Hence], here in the length of half a millimeter, are encompassed all of the major prob- lems of dynamic psychology [p. 446]. This postulate of psychological equivalence is itself based on a prior assumption: that the behavior of organisms, human and infrahuman alike, is automatic or machine-like. "We must regard the process of learning," writes Hull, "as wholly automatic.... Recourse cannot be had to any monitor, entelechy, mind or spirit" (p. 69). This notion of behavior is spelled out by Boring in a delightful passage. I believe that robotic thinking helps precision of psychological thought, and will continue to help it until psychophysiology is so far advanced that an image is nothing other than a neural event, and object constancy is obviously something that happens in the brain. That time is still a long way off, and in the interval I choose to sit cozily with my robot, squeezing his hand and feeling a thrill-a scientist's thrill-when he squeezes mine back again [p. 192]. Hence, since neither humans nor infrahuman animals have minds, and since interspecific differences in neurology and physiology are negligible, there is no basis for assuming a human, as distinct from an infrahuman nature. There are, of course, many social and clinical psychologists who take serious issue with this point of view (cf. Allport 1940; Murray 1951). Some currents within social psychology, as well, see a basic identity be- tween humans and infrahumans. Attempting to discover the uniquely human in the motivational aspects of behavior, social psychology-taking its cue from learning theory-distinguishes "primary," or biological, drives from "second- ary" or acquired drives. Human behavior is then distinguished from infra- human behavior in the complex repertory of "secondary" drives to be found in the former. Nevertheless, these acquired drives are not "basic"; they are "elaborations" of the biological drives, serving "as a fagade behind which the functioning of the underlying (biological) drives are hidden" (Dollard and Miller 33). Since the acquired drives constitute the "superstructure of human motivation," human nature consists of "the biological endowment of the species" (Sherif: 18, 38). This view, of course, is not restricted to psychology. In one of his most influential works, Malinowski writes: By human nature we mean the biological determinism which imposes on every civilization and on all individuals in it the carrying out of such bodily functions as breathing, sleep, rest, nutrition, excretion, and reproduction [p. 75]. The logic of this position can lead to only one conclusion. "Primary" or</page><page sequence="3">SPIRO] Human Nature in Its Psychological Dimensions 21 biological drives are not unique to man; he shares themewith all mammals. Hence, if human nature consists of man's biological drives, there is no distinc- tive human nature. Although rooted in evolutionary biology, anthropology has not hesitated to postulate a uniquely human nature, based on one criterion-culture. Never- theless, and despite its insistence on the "psychic unity of mankind," anthro- pology has been impressed by the great diversity in personality types, values, and motivations of behavior revealed in its ethnographic data. This diversity, it has been felt, can hardly be explained by the concept of psychic unity, but it can be explained by the concept of cultural determinism. Hence, though a uniquely human nature, as a product of culture, can be distinguished from an infrahuman acultural nature, a universal human nature does not exist-for it is relative to the historical experience of each society and its unique cultural configuration. HUMAN NATURE: (1) THE CAPACITY FOR SYMBOLIZATION We may now evaluate these three positions. The postulate of psychological equivalence may be criticized both logically and empirically. Logically, this postulate entails a false reductionism, as Irving has pointed out. In a discussion of the comparative method, he writes that the "great danger" inherent in this method lies in a: dissolving tendency which, in the beginning, seeks to explain a phenomenon x by com- paring it with a phenomenon y, and ends by explaining x away altogether or by reducing it to y. Nowhere has this tendency been more evident than in the study of the learning process by American psychologists [p. 547]. Empirically, the postulate of psychological equivalence may be criticized for ignoring interspecific variation, as some zoologists and natural historians have pointed out. Thorpe, for example, in an informative review of infrahuman learning, suggests that zoologists, as well as psychologists and physiologists, should study the phenomenon of learning: for there has been a tendency in the past for work on this subject to be too exclusively concerned with a few species, studied under highly artificial conditions, ignoring the immense variety and plasticity of behavior as seen under natural conditions [Thorpe 1950: 388]. Thorpe's argument, of course, applies afortiori to human learning. Current evolutionary thought lends credence to such criticism by its emphasis on "large and abrupt variations in evolution." This means, as Nissen points out, that: ... in behavior also we may expect to find discontinuity-qualitative rather than merely quantitative changes-as we pass from the lower to the higher animals forms. ... The comparative psychologist is now relatively free to postulate new capacities or new behavioral mechanisms at various points along the phylogenetic scale [p. 348]. The "new capacity" in man, which deserves greatest emphasis, is his capacity for conceptual thought, a capacity which Huxley has termed "the first and most obviously unique characteristic of man" (Huxley: 3).</page><page sequence="4">22 American Anthropologist [56, 1954 That man is unique in the possession of language and thought is not a new insight for anthropologists. Boas pointed to this fact over forty years ago (Boas: 147); anthropologists, among others, have demonstrated the depend- ence of thought on language (cf. Whorf, 1950; Lee, 1938); and Kroeber's pithy comment on the absence of speech among infrahuman animals, written twenty-five years ago still holds: "Animals do not speak because they have nothing to say" (Kroeber: 330). It is well to remind ourselves, however, of the crucial role this capacity for symbolization plays in human culture. The existence of culture pre- supposes a set of needs for which there are no instinctual modes of satisfaction, and, hence, which require learned techniques (culture) for their satisfaction. These techniques had to be invented; to do so required the capacity to delay response, to conceive of alternative responses, and to select responses in terms of imagined consequences. In short, the existence of culture, as a distinctively human technique of adaptation, presupposes the capacity for the symbolic representation and manipulation of the environment-that is, conceptual thought. Conceiving of culture in these terms, and viewing it within the broad perspective of biological evolution, we can understand the cogency of Nissen's statement that "it is in the cognitive ... aspects of behavior that we find the significant axes of behavioral evolution" (Nissen: 380). But cultural transmission, as well as cultural invention, requires the capac- ity for symbolization. Human behavior, as Goldstein's work on aphasia re- veals, involves the "abstract" in contrast to the "concrete attitude." In ex- plicating these two concepts, he writes: In "concrete" performances a reaction is determined directly by the stimulus, is awakened by all the individual perceives. The individual's procedure is somewhat pas- sive, as if it were not he who had the initiative. In "abstract" performances an action is not determined directly and immediately by a stimulus configuration but by the account of the situation which the individual gives to himself. The performance is thus more a primary action than a mere reaction, and it is a totally different way of coming to terms with the outside world. The individual has to consider the situation from various aspects, pick out the aspect which is essential, and act in a way appropri- ate to the whole situation. . . . Even in its simplest form, abstraction is separate in principle from concrete behavior. There is no gradual transition from one to the other. [Goldstein: 59-61.1 Goldstein's patients, characterized by the impairment of the symbolic capacity--the "abstract attitude"- are unable to engage in many behaviors characteristic of human beings. For example, they find it difficult or impossible to engage in any behavior which demands that they detach the ego from the outer world and from inner experience; assume a mental set; account for acts to oneself and verbalize the account; shift reflectively from one aspect of a situation to another; hold in mind simultaneously various aspects of a situa- tion; grasp the essential point of given whole; break the whole into parts, and isolate and synthesize these parts; abstract common properties reflectively, and form hierarchic concepts; plan ahead ideationally, assume an attitude</page><page sequence="5">SPIRO] Human Nature in Its Psychological Dimensions 23 toward the merely possible (Goldstein and Scheerer). More important for the student of culture is the further fact that they cannot perform customs; that is, they are incapable of learning and transmit- ting culture. The explanation for the latter incapacity is that human behavior is not automatic and it does require mind. As Goldstein puts it: A custom is never an external phenomenon, but is connected with the whole personal- ity. Without the abstract attitude-that is, insight into the significance of customs for the life of the individual and society-its development is impossible. This attitude is a prerequisite for the taking over of a custom ... [Goldstein: 217]. The evidence, I believe, is clear. One psychological dimension that distin- guishes the class, human, from the class, infrahuman, is a unique human cognitive function-the capacity for symbolization. It should be noted, in passing, that the human symbolic capacity is re- sponsible for maladaptive, as well as for adaptive, behavior. Huxley shows how subhuman conflict (in the psychological sense) is prevented by the seriated expression of instinct, so that at any given moment only one is dominant in the animal's behavioral repertory (Huxley: 22). In man, on the other hand, his capacity to respond, symbolically, to a number of quite different-and often contradictory-stimuli simultaneously may lead to serious mental conflict. HUMAN NATURE: (2) THE BASIC MOTIVES The proposition that the innate drives are natural whereas the acquired drives are "superstructures," is not a statement of fact, but a value judgment based on the assumption that the organism is analytically and empirically prior to society. As students of culture we do not share this assumption. The foetalization of the human species (cf. Drennan) and the loss of instinctual modes of need-satisfaction have meant that the biodynamics of the organism are not a sufficient condition for human survival; and that society, far from being an adjunct to the organism has become a necessary and the natural condition for the survival of man, qua organism. Without a cultural heritage, which not only provides man with learned modes of drive satisfaction (culture patterns), but also (and this is the important point here) with learned motiva- tions for the performance of those culture patterns which are instrumental to the satisfaction of biological drives, man could not survive. If this be true, then any drive which has adaptive value, be it derived from the organism or from society, is natural. It is claimed, however, that man's socially derived drives are not basic, for in situations of extreme drive-deprivation the biological drives become dominant in his drive hierarchy. As Sherif writes: As the deprivation of biogenic needs (sleep, food, or water) begins to grow intense, the individual returns or regresses to the level which is dominated by the biogenic needs, and the superstructure of the acquired motives is subject to collapse in various degrees [Sherif: 10].</page><page sequence="6">24 American Anthropologist [56, 1954 This observation, again, minimizes the integral relationship between human functioning and social reality. The normal condition for human homeostatic functioning, biological and psychological alike, is a functioning culture. In this normal condition man's acquired drives are dominant, both in number as well as in his drive hierarchy (cf. Maslow). Situations of intense drive depriva- tion are highly abnormal for they are characterized by cultural malfunction- ing. If culture and organism are both necessary for human existence, the malfunctioning of culture constitutes a pathogenic condition, and generaliza- tions inferred from behavior arising in such conditions refer to pathological, not normal, behavior. In contrast, it is significant to observe in this connection that "hunger, thirst, oxygen-deficit, and sexual tension, in their basic physiolo- gical forms, are rarely important in behavior pathology" (Cameron and Magaret: 35). Furthermore there are numerous instances in which it is simply not true that biological drives, even in situations of extreme deprivation, come to domi- nate behavior. Recent studies of behavior of Nazi concentration camp inmates, for example, reveal that far from being reduced to the biological level exclu- sively, prisoners developed a new social system in which, to be sure, many of their previous "secondary" drives disappeared, but in which there evolved a new set of drives and values which guided and motivated their behavior (cf. Luchterhand). Finally, the distinction between primary and secondary drives as empiri- cally distinct phenomena remains an open question. Whatever the logical status of the asocial biological individual may be as an analytic concept, the fact remains that human beings are always found in societies. Hence, biologi- cal growth is never isolated from a cultural context, and the socialization proc- ess, which begins at birth, serves to modify, intensify, and distort innate structures. Therefore, since the relationship between biological drives and the organism can never be expressed as a simple function, but must be viewed as the product of the interaction of organism and culture, it may perhaps be "fruitless," as Dewey says, "to distinguish between the native and the ac- quired, the original and the derived" (Dewey: 532). Clinicians, such as Cameron and Magaret, feel that this distinction is not only "fruitless," but impossible to make. Physiological disequilibrium, at least in human organisms, is so early and so thor- oughly modified by social learning that pure or "primary" needs do not exist except in theory .... At no point in the progression from the generalized tensions which include genital responsiveness, to the complex attitudes of fear, shame, or guilt over sex behavior, can we isolate "primary" sex needs from the matrix of social learning within which it develops. Like hunger, thirst, oxygen-deficit, or temperature imbalance, the disequilibrium of sex need begins in a social context and is never separated from it [Cameron and Magaret: 35-37]. But society is not only necessary for the survival of man, qua organism, it is crucial for the emergence of man, qua human. To develop a mind and a self it is necessary that the infant live in a human society and acquire its cultural heritage, as is shown by the theoretical analyses of the "symbolic interaction-</page><page sequence="7">sPIRO] Human Nature in Its Psychological Dimensions 25 ists" (Mead; Cooley) as well as other theorists (DeLaguna); the empirical data on isolated children (cf. Davis 1940; 1947), and the empirical data on "hospitalism" (cf. Spitz 1945; 1946). In describing the social life of infrahuman animals, Zuckerman writes: "If anthropomorphic interpretation is put aside, their lives are a series of overt responses that are adapted to three main lines of behavior-search for food, search for mates, avoidance of enemies" (Zucker- man: 17). No anthropologist would classify a society whose members were motivated exclusively by these three drives as human. These drives constitute man's mammalian motivations; his other drives, derived from culture, consti- tute his uniquely human motivations, and, in conjunction with his biological drives, enable him to develop a mind and a self. Far from being "secondary," then, man's acquired drives are "primary" in the determination of his distinct- ly human characteristics. Hence, since man's acquired drives constitute his uniquely human motiva- tions, and since they are as natural as his biological motivations, we may char- acterize man's acquired drives as constituting another psychological dimen- sion-motivationally viewed-of a uniquely human nature. HUMAN NATURE: (3) THE COMMON PERSONALITY FACTOR Most anthropologists would probably be in accord with the general form, if not the specific details, of the foregoing discussion. Anthropology has tended to argue, however, that since the nature of the acquired drives, and the ex- pression of the symbolic capacity are culturally determined, it is dubious if we can postulate a universal human nature. If this inference were valid, the entire anthropological enterprise would have probably been impossible, in its empirical as well as in its theoretical aspects. Cultural research demands that we not only observe our subjects, but that we live with them. The ability to live with an exotic people, isolated from our own society, and to participate in their "strange" life without, literally, becoming mad, presupposes a human nature common to us and to our subjects, alike. If this statement seems extreme let us imagine the opposite situation. Let us assume that the "primitive" peoples we study do, in fact, have different "natures" than we do-as different as the "natures" of the white rats of the psychological laboratories. Let us further assume, as is the case in many field studies, that we are completely isolated from members of our own society, so that our only possibility for interaction is with the members of this society with whom we are now living. But since we share no common nature, is inter- action, in any meaningful sense, possible? Is true communication possible? Can we exchange common meanings? Are we even living in the same "reality"? Are we not, with respect to this society, in the identical position as a schizo- phrenic in our own society--in it, but not of it. Have we not, in fact, become schizophrenic personalities whose communication channels are blocked and whose reality testing is severely impaired? That this does not happen is due to that common bond of human nature which enables us to share the feelings and sentiments of the people we study, as they, in turn, can share ours. That anthropological theorizing presupposes a universal human nature is</page><page sequence="8">26 American Anthropologist [56, 1954 even more apparent. In any science, including anthropology, theory is made possible by abstracting the general properties of the phenomenon studied, classifying these properties, and relating them to each other or to other phenomena as dependent or independent variables. Despite the diversity among cultures we are able to abstract a "universal culture pattern" (Wissler ch. 5), from this diversity and, thus, to theorize about the generic nature of culture or about any of its aspects. That we are able to do so presupposes a universal human nature; for by the same logic that we infer a uniquely human nature from the existence of specific cultures, so we may infer a universal human nature from the existence of the universal culture pattern. Whether this universal human nature is an expression of culture, or whether the uni- versal culture pattern is an expression of human nature is not the concern of this discussion, though we would surely agree with Murdock, when he writes that the universal culture pattern cannot be attributed to: history, or race, or any other factor limited in time or space, since the universal pattern links all known cultures, simple and complex, ancient and modern. It can only be sought, therefore, in the fundamental biological and psychological nature of man and in the universal conditions of human existence [Murdock: 125]. For our purposes here, however, it is sufficient to indicate that in the absence of a universal human nature, there would be no universal culture pattern, and that in the absence of a universal culture pattern there could be no science of anthropology. It is readily apparent, as anthropologists have always pointed out, that the relatively narrow range of personality types or institutional forms found with- in a given society cannot be said to constitute or to express a universal human nature. It is our thesis, however, that underlying the wide range of personality types and institutional forms described in the anthropological literature there are a small number of behavioral principles-the dynamics of personality functioning--which are universal, and which constitute a universal human nature. This discussion will be limited to those dynamic principles which may be viewed as the psychological prerequisites for the functioning of culture. They are "needs," "values," "ego processes," and "defense mechanisms." Needs. Behavior is instituted by needs. If culture is functional, that is, if it is instrumental to the satisfaction of needs, we can infer man's universal needs from the universal culture pattern. The inferred biological needs-those satisfied by certain aspects of the technological, economic, social, and political systems-are universal not only in man, but in the entire class, mammalia. Other needs, however, are unique to man and universal in man. We shall exam- ine but one of these: Every culture has a world view. And despite the cross-cultural diversity in world views, Redfield has been able to abstract a universal world view. This world view, writes Redfield, includes the: recognition of the self and others; groupings of people, some intimate and similar to oneself, others far and different; some usual ways of attending the inevitable experiences of the human career; a confrontation of the Not-man seen in some ordered relationship</page><page sequence="9">SPIRO] Human Nature in Its Psychological Dimensions 27 of component entities, this Not-man including both some observed features, such as earth, sky, day and night, and also invisible beings, wills and powers [Redfield: 31-32]. From the components of this world view we can infer a human need to explain man's existence, as well as many of his experiences with reference to his self, his fellow-men, and the cosmos. That this need has found its universal satis- faction in art, mythology, religion, and science has led Langer to term it the need for the "symbolic transformation of experience" (Langer, ch. 2). The universality of this need extends to the specific experiences which require symbolic transformation. The characteristic concerns of religious ritual, for example, include those experiences commemorated in the rites de passage; and these same experiences, plus a small core of others, constitute the uni- versal themes of mythology, if we can believe certain mythologists (cf. Jung; Campbell). Values. Although behavior is instituted by needs, it is governed by at least one consideration that is extraneous to need-satisfaction-values. Al- though the methods of need-satisfaction differ from society to society, all societies distinguish between morally right and morally wrong methods. Hence, Linton has observed that for man the method of satisfying a need is as impor- tant as its satisfaction (Linton: 92). The reason is clear. Although everything that exists has a nature, man-as his world views reveal-has theories about his nature. The significant and paradoxical characteristic of human behavior, is that it is determined not so much by man's nature, as by the theories he has concerning his nature (which, of course, are part of his nature); not so much by his level of achievement, as by his level of aspiration; not so much by his real culture, as by his ideal culture. Regardless of the jargon employed, the point is clear: there is an "imperative dimension" in cultural behavior (Spiro, 1951, pp. 31-36) such that humans tend to choose those behavior pat- terns that are in accord with their cultural values even at the cost of reduced need-satisfaction. This last qualification indicates that this value dimension of experience, like symbolic behavior in general, is not necessarily "valuable" from the stand- point of human adjustment. On the contrary, this human emphasis on choosing the right method for the satisfaction of needs often results in attributing to means the status of ends, and this "functional autonomy" of human behavior, as Allport has termed it (Allport, 1937, ch. 7) may have serious dysfunctional consequences. Ego-processes. In order to behave it is necessary for man to have learned how to behave as well as to perceive and to know the basic features of his be- havioral world. The principles governing the processes of perception, learning, and cognition are universal. That selectivity of perception, for example, is a function (among other things) of cultural values, or that learning tends to occur in situations of need-blockage, or that new cognitions tend to be assimi- lated by one's previous cognitive structure--these are but a few of the uni- versal principles underlying these ego processes. Indeed if they were not uni- versal we should find it impossible to understand or to explain the behavior of individuals in other societies.</page><page sequence="10">28 A merican A nthropologist [56, 1954 It is apparent that the three aspects of behavior we have been discussing correspond to the three components of personality structure postulated by dynamic personality theory: id, ego, and superego. The concept of personality structure is not mystical. It refers to that which we know on a common sense level: that the behavior of an individual is not random, that his needs (id), values (superego), and executive-response processes (ego) are organized to some degree. This organization is termed "personality structure," and it is the universality of this personality structure which constitutes the psychological core of human nature. Defense mechanisms. Personality not only has structure, it has functions as well. Limitations of space permit us to discuss only one of these functions. It is not only the observer who is aware of the organization of the total psycho- logical processes of the individual. The individual himself is subjectively aware of the totality of his own psychological processes; that is, he is aware of his self. Self-awareness plays an enormous role in human behavior, for to most people their own selves are the objects of greatest value. Hence, the defense of the self against danger and injury is as important-if not more important- for man as the defense of the organism against physical injury. No society- no matter how perfect-prevents the existence of threat or danger to the selves of its members. In the very process of becoming human-the socialization process-demands are made on the child which are inevitably frustrating and which are perceived by him as threatening. Moreover, the threat to self comes not only from others but from oneself: failure to achieve one's goals or to con- form to one's values is perceived as a threat to one's self (experienced as anxiety or as guilt). Regardless of the source, the integrity of the self must be defended against such threats to its esteem, if the person is to achieve and maintain an ade- quate adjustment. The defense of the self is a universal function of personality. The mechanisms of defense--those symbolic techniques of projection, displace- ment, rationalization, sublimation, and so forth-represent universal psycho- logical processes which function to defend the self against its own conflicts, anxieties, and guilt feelings. In the absence of this personality function it is highly probable that culture could not survive; for only by resolving these tensions psychodynamically does man refrain from resolving them in overt and direct behavior, behavior which could mean the destruction of his culture's values and, hence, of culture itself. Hallowell does not exaggerate when he observes that these defense mechanisms are some of the major mechanisms through which man becomes psychobiologically structured in the socialization process. They are intrinsic to the psychodynamics of hu- man adjustment .... Traditional terms like the "psychic unity" of man, or "human nature" which have been emptied of their original meaning become genuinely signifi- cant again if we mean a primate whose level of adjustment implies such processes and mechanisms [Hallowell: 171]. It should be emphasized that culture itself provides many of the basic channels for the expression of these mechanisms. Indeed, Kardiner terms re-</page><page sequence="11">SPIRO] Human Nature in Its Psychological Dimensions 29 ligion and mythology the "projective systems" of a culture, for they may be viewed as affording an outlet for the projection of the society's underlying tensions (cf. Kardiner). We may conclude, then, that the structure and functioning of human personality constitutes man's universal human nature, psychologically viewed. Its universality is not only descriptively true; it is analytically true, as well. In the absence of human personality there could be no human culture.
