Keyser ABSTRACT Audrey's Overhang, a small pictograph site in Montana's Smith River Drainage, is part of a highly abstract rock art style localized in the Rocky Mountain foothills of central Montana. An abstract anthropo morph at Audrey's Overhang is similar to those at several nearby sites. Site characteristics suggest that the pictographs of this rock art style were painted as part of a vision guest ceremony. Because the rock art of much of the surrounding area is poorly known the external relationships of this central Montana rock art style remain to be demonstrated. INTRODUCTION Audrey's Overhang, 24ME58, is located in the Smith River drainage of central Montana (Fig. 1), approximately 40 miles south of Great Falls. The site consists of a few pictographs on the roofs of two small adjacent rock shelters overlooking Freeman Creek, a small north-bank tributary of Rock Creek which flows into the Smith River about 30 miles northwest of White Sulpher Springs, Mon tana (Fig. 1). The site was found and recorded during the summer of 1975. \ Jr Lttti* s?it C H Mountains ^_^$-N^^V^ ^St* 0 5_10 ^C^f-kan* ^"t mil? Fig. 1.

Geographic Setting Audrey's Overhang (Fig. 2) is actually two small rockshelters situated near the rim of a high limestone cliff at the head of a small, narrow box canyon just east of Freeman Creek. The site is at an elevation of 4800 feet, however, most of the surrounding area is considerably higher and the Little Belt Mountains to the east reach a maximum elevation of 8600 feet. Access to Audrey's Overhang is possible, although difficult, from either the pine parkland plateau to the east of the site or the Freeman Creek canyon bottom to the west and below the site. In this area Freeman Creek is deeply entrenched and flanked on both sides by steep limestone cliffs (Fig. 3). The creek bottom is a series of lush, swampy meadows. Numerous rockshelters, some of which contain occupational debris or faded pictographs, occur in the limestone cliffs along the entire lower two-mile section of Freeman Creek, and in the Rock Creek 183</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 3.

From Audrey's Overhang three large rock shelters are visible in the box canyon, but none of these was occupied prehistorically. An abandoned, pre-World War I homestead is located just west of the site in the Freeman Creek bottom at the mouth of the box canyon. THE SITE The two rockshelters composing Audrey's Overhang are relatively large (Fig. 2). The larger is 40 feet deep, 7 feet high, and nearly 75 feet wide at the mouth. The smaller, situated approximately 30 feet to the east, is 30 feet deep, 6 feet high, and 20 feet wide at the mouth. The floors of both rockshelters are fractured limestone bedrock; neither contains occupational debris. No evidence of occupa tion was found on the wide bench outside the rockshelters (Fig. 4). Both of the rockshelters have red picto graphs painted on their roofs. The larger shelter has three anthropomorphs (Fig. 5a) and a small cross painted on widely separated portions of the roof near the mouth of the shelter. On the roof of the smaller rockshelter, near its mouth, is a large maze-like pictograph (Figs. 5b, 6) that probably represents an abstract human figure, and several faded curved lines, located about four feet from the maze, that may originally have been a somewhat similar figure. The Pictographs The pictographs at Audrey's Overhang are painted in a "flat" red pigment, probably derived from iron oxide, but of a different hue than most red pictograph pigment used at sites in the surrounding area. In part, the hue could be due to water leaching. The three anthropomorphs in the larger rockshelter (Fig. 5a) are stick figures ranging from 5 to 9 inches tall. All have a prominent phallus, an enlarged bulbous head, two legs, and a cross-piece for arms. No hands or feet are portrayed. These anthropomorphs are somewhat similar to stick figure anthropo morphs in western Montana rock art ? such as those at site 24FH1007 (Keyser and Knight 1976:4, Fig. 2c) ? but the style of legs and arms is slightly different. Stylistically they more closely resemble anthropomorphs at several nearby sites (Shumate 1960:23-40) although the phalli on those at Audrey's Overhang are more prominent. It is unlikely that these figures represent lizard zoomorphs, since lizards portrayed in the rock art of this area have forward pointing legs with feet portrayed (Shumate 1960:19, 35). The simple cross has two 5 inch long arms that intersect perpendicularly at their approxi mate vertical midpoints. The maze on the roof of the smaller shelter (Figs. 5b, 6) is a complex, abstract anthropo ids SE ^ /'///A Audits Fig. 4. Schematic cross-section of box canyon at Audrey's Overhang.

Composed of finger-width lines, the glyph is 21 inches high and, at maximum, 14 inches wide. At the top is a short vertical line representing the neck or neck and head. Along the right side of the figure are two curved, upwardpointing appendages, each with a crude circle near the distal end. The body of the figure is filled with an abstract geometric design composed of (from top to bottom) a vertically oriented ladder-like heart line, a cross enclosed in a rectangle, and a closed U-shape with two nested concentric circles within it. All three elements are connected by short vertical lines. Interrupting the line that forms the left side of the figure, at the figure's approximate vertical midpoint, is a small two-inch diameter circle similar to those within the appendages on the figure's right side. This circle may represent an abstract appendage. Although the figure is highly abstract, my impression is that it represents a human. Elsewhere in Plains rock art elements com posing the figure are used to represent parts of anthropomorphs. The headless neck is found on many anthropomorphs at sites in the Writing-On-Stone area in southern Alberta (Keyser 1977) and occasionally elsewhere throughout the Northwestern Plains. Circles representing appendages, or associated with appendages, are found on the anthropo morphs at the Fish Creek pictographs (Connor 1962a), the Grinnvoll Rockshelter (Connor 1962b: 18), and elsewhere in Plains rock art (Grant 1967:135).

This figure consists of a few very poorly preserved curved line segments. Exfoliation and water seepage have destroyed most of the figure, but it originally was probably somewhat similar to the maze glyph. COMPARISONS AND INTERPRETATIONS The pictographs in the larger rockshelter are so simple and the motifs so commonplace that they cannot be reliably affiliated with any of the nearby regional rock art styles. Crosses are ubiquitous in Columbia Plateau rock art to the west and north (Keyser and Knight 1976:3, 6) and also in Plains rock art to the east and south (Connor and Connor 1971:33). 185</page><page sequence="4">The stick figure anthropomorphs are some what similar to those at nearby rock art sites in central Montana (Shumate 1960:24, 29, 40) especially in the manner of portrayal of arms and legs, but their stylistic simplicity pre cludes anything but tentative affiliation with this regional style. The maze-like anthropomorph in the smaller rockshelter, however, can be affiliated with a distinctive rock art style. It is part of a highly abstract rock art style that is apparently restricted to the Rocky Mountain foothills region of central Montana (Shumate 1960; Malouf 1961:3, 6). This style (including both Malouf's [1961] type 2 and type 3 picto graphs) consists of extremely abstract an thropomorphic and zoomorphic figures (Shumate 1960:6-36); numerous hand prints, both simulated (Shumate 1960:23, 31-32) and real (Shumate 1960:32; Mavis Loschekfer, personal communication 1976); and many abstract geomorphic figures (Shumate 1960; Arthur 1960:41). Of the several known examples of abstract anthropomorphs of this central Montana rock art style (Shumate 1960:9-10) the maze-like anthropomorph at Audrey's Overhang most closely resembles a human figure (Fig. 7) at Painted Coulee (Shumate 1960:9), a large pictograph site located southeast of Great Falls, Montana in the Little Belt Mountains, about 30 miles northeast of Audrey's Over hang (Fig. 1). The pictographs of this highly abstract central Montana style, including those at Audrey's Overhang, probably functioned in some sort of religious context, possibly the vision quest. The isolation of Audrey's Overhang, the difficulty of access, and the absence of occupational debris support this interpretation. Vision questing places were often specifically sought for these attributes. Shumate's (1960:2, 15, 32) descriptions of nearby pictograph sites that contain this abstract style, suggest that they also func tioned as vision questing sites. The motifs at the site support the interpretation of a ceremonial function. All of them were probably painted by a single individual or at most by two individuals using the site at different times. Abstract designs often represent spirits or supernatural phe nomena, especially in rock art (Keyser and Knight 1976:9; Grant 1967:28-34). Therefore, the differences between the realistic an Fig. 7.

Scale bar s 5 inches. thropomorphs and the associated abstract anthropomorph may indicate depictions of living men and supernatural beings. Cha racteristically, pictograph panels of this style include both abstract and realistic anthropo morphs (Shumate 1960). The ceremonial function postulated for this rock art is similar to the function of Columbia Plateau rock art in western Montana (Keyser and Knight 1977), some Northwestern Plains rock art (Keyser 1976), and the various rock art styles in other areas of the United States (Grant 1967:28-34). Cultural affiliations for this central Mon tana abstract rock art style cannot be determined. The geographic range of this style is still imperfectly known. However, it does not appear, as has been suggested (Malouf 1961:6), to have any obvious af filiation with the Type II and Type III abstract petroglyphs at the Dinwoody site in central Wyoming (Gebhard and Cahn 1950), since the similarities between the central Montana pictographs and the Dinwoody petroglyphs are limited to the concept of abstraction of the human form. Stylistically the figures of these two rock art styles are very different. 186</page><page sequence="5">The central Montana rock art style is distinctively different than the simplistic style of the Plateau Salishan groups who occupied western Montana (Keyser and Knight (1976:10-11) and also differs from the various Northwestern Plains rock art styles found to the east (Connor 1962b:7; Keyser 1977). The age of this rock art style cannot be determined, although all of the known examples may date to the prehistoric period since horses and guns are not portrayed. CONCLUSIONS Audrey's Overhang is a pictograph site in the Smith River drainage of central Montana. The major motif at the site is an abstract maze-like anthropomorph which indicates that the pictographs are part of a distinctive, highly abstract rock art style that is restricted to the eastern Rocky Mountain foothill region in central Montana. The physical character istics of Audrey's Overhang and other nearby sites of the same style, and the morphological differences between various motifs of the style, suggest that the pictographs functioned in the context of a stylized vision quest. No similar rock art style occurs in any of the nearby areas of the Plains, Great Basin, or Columbia Plateau; however, the rock art of many of these areas is imperfectly known.
