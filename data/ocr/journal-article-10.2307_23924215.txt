<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONSTRUCTION OF SANCTITY: PICTORIAL HAGIOGRAPHY AND MONASTIC REFORM IN THE FIRST ILLUSTRATED LIFE OF ST. CUTHBERT (OXFORD, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE MS 165) Magdalena Elizabeth Carrasco A striking feature of recent publications commemorating the death of St. Cuthbert (d. 687) and the foundation of Durham Cathedral (1093) has been the rela tive lack of attention to pictorial interpretations of the saint's life and miracles.1 This is all the more surprising because the oldest surviving exemplar—a small volume pre served as Oxford, University College, MS 1652—constitutes both the earliest extant post-Conquest manuscript with an extensive cycle of religious narrative illustrations and the oldest surviving English representative of the illustrated libellus. Manuscripts of this distinctive medieval genre were devoted entirely to the life and miracles of a saint and were often produced in connection with the promotion of the saint's cult by the community housing his relics.3 The Oxford Vita Cuthberti is well-known to art historians, in part because of its prominent position in Otto Pächt's essay on the de velopment of narrative in post-Conquest art.4 Yet, although the text of University College MS 165 served as the basis for Bertram Colgrave's edition and translation of Bede's prose biography of the saint,5 the accompanying drawings have not been fully recognized as an important source for understanding the cult of St. Cuthbert in the Anglo-Norman period.6 The decoration of the Oxford Vita Cuthberti opens with a full-page painted miniature consisting of an author portrait and a presentation scene in which Bede of fers his work to the monks of Lindisfarne.7 A drawing in colored ink precedes each of the fifty-five chapters of the text, comprising Bede's Vita prosaica, two miracles excerpted from Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica (4:31-32), as well as a group of seven post-mortem miracles.8 The manuscript's textual components, together with stylistic and iconographie evidence, locate the Oxford Vita Cuthberti in Durham at a date of approximately 1100.9 This places the manuscript at a crucial point in the history of Cuthbert's cult.10 In 1083, William of St.-Calais (1080-96), the second Norman bishop of Durham, displaced the existing secular canons and installed a community of Benedictine monks.11 Bishop William's reform inaugurated a significant expansion Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 47</page><page sequence="2">of the cult of St. Cuthbert, whose relics had been housed at Durham since the end of the tenth century.12 A series of historical writings produced at Durham established explicit links between the new Benedictine house and the venerable traditions of St. Cuthbert. Primary among these texts is the work traditionally known as the Historia Dunelmensis Ecclesiae, usually attributed to Symeon of Durham, a member of the monastic community, and dated between 1104 and 1107.13 As related by Symeon, the revival of monasticism in the north, at sites such as Jarrow, Wearmouth, Whitby, and Durham, was modeled on the achievements of earlier Northumbrian monasticism and the tradition of Bede and St. Cuthbert. Knowledge of Bede's historical writings im pelled monks such as Aldwin of Winchcombe to move north to live in sites associated with Cuthbert and the Northumbrian saints. Inspired by his own reading of Bede's Ecclesiastical History and Life of St. Cuthbert, Bishop Walcher of Durham (1071-80) subsequently invited Aldwin and his companions to settle at Jarrow.14 William of St.-Calais, Walcher's successor, was stimulated to transform Durham it self by his reading of unspecified ancient writings ("antiquorum scripta").15 Reflect ing the consciously retrospective character of his reform, William "did not set a new way of monastic life but, with God renewing it, re-established the old."16 This retro spective attitude is in keeping with what Giles Constable has called the "passion for revival and renewal in the eleventh and twelfth centuries," when significant changes, like those occasioned by the Norman conquest of England, were "often masked by the prefix re- and presented as a reform, renewal, rebirth, or restoration."17 If Symeon exaggerated the innovative qualities of William's reform, he did so, as William Aird has argued, because his text was designed to explain and justify the role of the new monastic community in the continuing history of Cuthbert's church. Symeon's insis tence on the reassertion of traditional virtues, taken together with Symeon's criticisms of the secular canons displaced by William of St.-Calais, was in fact part of a con sciously articulated campaign to establish the validity of the monastic reform.18 The link between Cuthbert and the newly introduced monks was a peculiarly intimate one. Essential to Cuthbert's cult was the preservation of his miraculously in corrupt body, discovered, as Bede relates, at the opening of Cuthbert's tomb on March 20, 698, eleven years after his death.19 Forced to abandon Lindisfarne by the Viking raids, Cuthbert's relics eventually came to rest at Durham in 995.20 In the centuries following Cuthbert's death, new texts written to supplement Bede's familiar biography of the saint demonstrate Cuthbert's continued powers as thaumaturge, but also his ability to defend the lands and possessions of the see of Durham acquired in the centuries following Cuthbert's death.21 In the Historia de sancto Cuthberti, writ ten in the mid-tenth century, Bede's ascetic hermit and reluctant bishop has been transformed into a formidable feudal lord who uses his divine powers to defend the 48 First Illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="3">property rights of his community.22 Graphic depiction of this change is provided by a series of posthumous punitive miracles, often at Cuthbert's tomb. In the Oxford Vita, theft of the saint's lands is equated with the violation of his sanctuary; both are presented as sacrilegious acts calling forth divine retribution23 (Figs. 1—2). The ceremony celebrating the introduction of monks into Durham in 1083 clearly established the intimate personal bond between Cuthbert and his new monastic community. As part of the celebration of the mass, Bishop William "gave his blessing to those persons who had promised that they would fix their residence in this place, and he bound them by a link which could not be severed to the body of the most holy father Cuthbert." Significantly, William's first publicly announced administrative act was the appointment of Leofwin as sacristan, entrusted with "the care of the church and of the incorrupt body of St. Cuthbert"; after appointing Aldwin as prior, William reaffirmed the property rights of the newly professed monks.24 Accompanied by Prior Turgot and Malcolm III, king of Scotland, Bishop William laid the foundation of the new Romanesque cathedral in 1093.25 Eleven years later the authenticity of Cuth bert's continued presence at Durham was reaffirmed by a translation, accompanied by a public examination of the body, celebrated in an elaborately staged ceremony in 1104.26 The transfer of Cuthbert's relics from the old Anglo-Saxon minster, appar ently still extant, to the new Romanesque cathedral consolidated the legitimacy of the new monastic community. The creation of a densely illustrated manuscript devoted to St. Cuthbert might have been expected as part of the equipment necessary to furnish his renovated shrine, following a pattern found at other contemporary shrines and pilgrimage centers.27 Yet the precise origin as well as the original function of the Oxford Vita Cuthberti remain unclear. Malcolm Baker has established that the surviving cycles of the life of St. Cuthbert, including the Oxford manuscript, descend from a lost archetype produced ca. 1083—1090.28 In addition, D. H. Fanner has argued that the Oxford Vita Cuth berti is not a shrine book, in which accounts of the saint's life and miracles are often supplemented by liturgical and historical materials, but rather a book of private devo tion.29 This suggestion is supported by the manuscript's small size: unlike many of the illustrated vitae studied by Francis Wormald and Barbara Abou-El-Haj, the Oxford Vita Cuthberti actually is a libellus, a "little book" (197 x 122 mm), more appropriate for private reading than for public display. It may be that the lost arche type identified by Baker was a more elaborate shrine book, created explicitly for the public promotion of Cuthbert's cult at Durham, whereas the Oxford manuscript is a slightly later and perhaps less comprehensive work intended for individual devotion.30 We are reminded that the monks of Durham were not simply the guardians of Cuth bert's physical remains; their legitimacy was also dependent on their position as the Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 49</page><page sequence="4">man tlrtrwsr* ctipu&gt;iiunu&gt;}&gt;utes w u "V T Figure 1.

The illustrations in the Oxford Vita and even the manuscript itself, as a physical object intended for private reading and devotion, provide eloquent testimony on this point. Whatever the origins of the Oxford Vita Cuthberti, the decision to create an elaborate pictorial hagiography for St. Cuthbert must be understood in the context of the post-Conquest reform at Durham. Given the strongly retrospective quality of the reform, it is not surprising to find in the hagiographie imagery of the Oxford Vita Cuthberti similar assertions of continuity between the newly reformed community and earlier monastic life at Lindisfarne. Yet although each chapter of the Oxford manu script is accompanied by a drawing, these images are inevitably selective in relating individual details and even entire episodes. This selectivity, coupled with occasional deviations from or additions to the text, creates a pictorial commentary on the text. The importance of this pictorial commentary is accentuated by its placement within the manuscript: since each chapter is preceded by a drawing, the visual image condi tions the reader's perception of Bede's text. In some cases, deviations from Bede's account can be shown to represent modi fications of received tradition made in response to concerns specific to the post Conquest period. Useful in this context is Raymond Van Dam's concept of "verbal relics," written documents such as saints' lives, which can be distinguished from material relics because of their flexibility. Each revision of, or addition to, the textual dossier of a saint carries the potential to elaborate and reinterpret significantly the saint's personality and its attendant cult.31 Richly decorated manuscripts associated with the cult of a saint, like the Oxford Vita Cuthberti, occupy a middle ground be tween these two categories. As material objects, such manuscripts could partake of the supernatural power associated with traditional relics, and we know that special volumes devoted to the community's patron saint were sometimes found in or near the saint's shrine.32 But pictorial cycles, like their textual accompaniments, are simi larly subject to revision and elaboration; in fact, the same is true of the reliquaries and shrines created for the display of material relics. In the Oxford Vita Cuthberti, far from providing a mere literal rendition of a venerable text, the artist's pictorial com mentary, interpreted in conjunction with Bede's Vita and set within the context of contemporary historical developments, constitutes a valuable and as yet incompletely explored source for understanding the cult of St. Cuthbert in the period following the Norman conquest.33 A comprehensive examination of all fifty-five illustrations is beyond the scope of this essay, which is limited to a detailed consideration of several images with special bearing on the ideals of monastic life as embodied in the hagio graphie personality of St. Cuthbert, reinterpreted at the end of the eleventh century by the newly reformed community at Durham. Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 51</page><page sequence="6">Spirituality and Narrative: Sacred Time and Historical Time In his study of pictorial narrative in twelfth-century English art, Otto Pacht used the Oxford Vita Cuthberti to identify a distinctive mode of narration which he saw as particularly characteristic ofpictorial hagiography.34 Pacht noted that the drawings preceding each chapter of Bede's text often comprise two episodes from the same story, thereby introducing the passage of time as a key element of the pictorial lan guage. In the first of two examples cited by Pacht, the artist juxtaposes two consecu tive episodes : Cuthbert being asked for help, and the saint extinguishing a fire through prayer (Fig. 3). In a second example the saint appears only once, prophesying that an eagle will provide him and his traveling companion with food; immediately, the youth runs forth to retrieve a fish brought by the eagle (Fig. 4). Pächt's discussion is helpful in dealing with some of the scenes in the Oxford manuscript, especially those in which the implied passage of time is used to signify Cuthbert's spiritual powers. As in the episode of the miraculous provision of food by the eagle, the artist presents "two moments illustrating the situation before and after some miraculous change brought about by the saint."35 This narrative structure can also be found in some of the posthumous miracles, where the attempt to desecrate Cuthbert's shrine is immediately paired with the saint's punitive response.36 Here the shrine itself stands as a still yet potent vehicle for the transmission of Cuthbert's protective wrath. A pagan interferes with Cuthbert's possessions and enters the church, abusing the saint; he is struck dead at the church door (p. 149). A thief steals some of the saint's treasures, and he dies miserably of a burning fever (Fig. 2). But Pächt's sequential mode of narration does not apply to all, or even most, of the illustrations, which are characterized by a far greater variety of narrative struc tures. What is more, these structures are intimately linked to the central problem of conveying Cuthbert's spirituality as conceived by the newly-reformed monastic com munity of Durham In many cases the emphasis is not on sudden change, which is the essence of Pächt's concept of narrative, but rather on notions of continuity and per manence. Cuthbert's exceptional virtues enable him to intervene, as God's agent, in the temporal affairs of men; in Cynthia Hahn's words, he functions as a "lightning rod for the power of God."37 But in addition to showing the beneficial effects of Cuthbert's spiritual grace on the members of his community, the artist is also inter ested in characterizing the specific attributes of Cuthbert's spiritual personality. Some of these, such as the gift of prophecy, are unique to Cuthbert as a saint, whereas others constitute a model of behavior accessible to the members of the monastic community entrusted with preserving Cuthbert's legacy. In both cases, the narrative structures minimize or negate the notion of change over time in favor of portraying 52 First Illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="7">0 Jf» ftarrta dotrj cut da u lofttc ardmctsosaftdo vc T /f*i( ff / (ftrtnwtr fcYinifyfl) lofne faritaYhcu.fi caa ucru que muln ftntudiffarrau tmdtfm mi ♦r»&lt;* f i.i t ^trwrr-, ivrwrn i pw r'1i *»*-wi Figure 3.

(Photo: The Master and Fellows of University College, Oxford.) that which is permanently valid. This is fully in keeping with the attitude of the Durham monks, for whom Cuthbert's incorrupt body, as well as the saint's spiritual ideals, remained a continuous living presence. The narrative device of simultaneity, rather than sequential change, is used to illustrate Cuthbert's gift of prophecy, a quality that emphasizes the saint's ability to transcend conventional limitations of historical time and partake of the timeless wis dom of God. In Chapter 27 Bede describes an episode that transpired at the famous Roman fountain at Carlisle, when Cuthbert "saw in spirit" the destruction of King Ecgffith and his army, just as the saint had foretold the year before to the king's sis ter, Aelfflaed, in Chapter 24 (Fig. 5).38 The artist appears to have followed Bede's text quite closely: Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 53</page><page sequence="8">41 Figure 4. Cuthbert's prophecy and its fulfillment. Life of St. Cuthbert (Durham, ca. 1100); Oxford, University College, MS 165, p. 41.

'"39 Cuthbert is shown at the moment of learning the outcome of the battle. Leaning on his staff with his head tinned down, he is surrounded by a concerned but as yet un comprehending crowd. To the right are two figures mentioned at the very end of this rather long chapter: ... the day afterward, one arrived who had fled from the fight and explained by his sad story the mysterious prophecies of the man of God.

The point is not a miracle conveyed by the passage of time, but two distinct modes of knowledge of the same event; in this sense the two episodes are not distinct and sequential, but simul taneous.41 Somewhat more complicated is the illustration to Chapter 26 (Fig. 6), already discussed by Baker in a slightly different context. Bede emphasizes Cuthbert's pas toral work as a newly made bishop, and in the right-hand scene the artist shows Cuthbert addressing a group of men and women from his diocese. This pictorial formula, which recalls conventional images of preaching, appears to illustrate Bede's claim that Cuthbert ".. . guarded the people who had been committed to his charge ... and called them to heavenly things by his most wholesome admonitions " But Bede is also careful to claim that the new bishop never abandoned the ideals of his Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 55</page><page sequence="10">... j. 1M eoalllmao cnfeqtc n o3x'. &lt;*Tui(tcatm fe dno tuor fdtuufmane&amp;pparujc tlk •* t ; My4PY 4 %-?

(Photo: The Master and Fellows of University College, Oxford.) earlier life as a monk and hermit: "Gladly and diligently he practiced his wonted frugality and, amid the thronging crowds, rejoiced to preserve the rigors of monastic life."42 On the left Cuthbert is shown in just such a contemplative role, seated alone and holding a book. As Baker pointed out, Bede's "reminder that Cuthbert was monk as well as bishop no doubt caught the attention of the artist in the newly founded Durham community," for it was precisely Cuthbert the monk "whose way of life they were attempting to emulate."43 Baker's analysis can be extended further if we examine this two-part scene in terms of its narrative structure. Instead of presenting a before-and-after sequence of two consecutive episodes, the artist juxtaposes two images that are meant to be per ceived as simultaneous. Just as the two episodes are framed by half-arches springing from a single column, so too does Cuthbert unite in himself the dual ideals of monk and bishop. Any notion of narrative progression, of change over time, is denied, and the miniature becomes instead a permanent character portrait illustrating qualities 56 First Illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="11">that apply to Cuthbert's successors no less than to the saint himself. Cuthbert's synthesis of the hagiographie types of monk and bishop had already been suggested by the artist in Chapter 22, where Cuthbert leans out of his window to instruct those who seek him out in his hermit's cell on the island of Farne (p. 67). As in the subse quent miniature for Chapter 26, Cuthbert combines the isolated, enclosed life of the contemplative with active pastoral care. The artist anticipates qualities fully revealed only later in Cuthbert's career by means of a kind of pictorial foreshadowing. In this the artist closely followed Bede's text, for Chapter 22 closes by citing a prophecy of Boisil, Cuthbert's old mentor at the monastery of Melrose, to the effect that Cuthbert would one day hold the office of bishop. Earlier in the manuscript Cuthbert is shown preaching to a large crowd following his appointment as prior of Melrose (Ch. 9, p. 33). This emphasis on the synthesis of the active and contemplative modes of life is fully in keeping with Bede's own intentions. As a number of authors have shown, in his account of Cuthbert's life Bede tempered the extreme asceticism and individual ism of the eremitic tradition, emphasizing as well the pastoral responsibilities of the ideal religious leader.44 The notions of simultaneity and permanence, as opposed to temporal change, extend beyond the paired episodes illustrating a single chapter. Multiple references to a distinctive set of spiritual ideals are continuously interwoven throughout the en tire manuscript in both verbal and pictorial form. Each drawing must be examined with reference to the complete text, as well as to the entire corpus of illustrations. Particularly relevant to the images we have been examining is Bede's description in Chapter 16 of the community at Lindisfarne, seen as a model by the twelfth-century reformers. Lindisfarne was the seat of a bishop, but also home of an abbot and monks, all of whom were careful to "keep the monastic rule in all things."45 Accord ing to Bede, this ideal was recommended by no less an authority than Gregory the Great, who advised Augustine of Canterbury that bishops should live under monastic rule in emulation of the customs of the early Church. In an earlier chapter Cuthbert's itinerant preaching is given a similar sanction: "... after the manner of the apostles, he was going through all parts in order to teach the way of salvation. . . ."46 The artist's distinctive interpretation of Cuthbert's life as bishop, with its emphasis on the synthesis of active pastoral care and monastic ideals of community, is more than a lit eral transcription of the immediately adjacent passage in Bede's text. The images are deliberately crafted to convey in paradigmatic form the ideals of Bede and Cuthbert, ideals that extend back in time to the apostolic era and that are to be renewed at the end of the eleventh century by the reformed community at Durham. To return to the concept of change indicated by the passage of time, the essence of Pächt's concept of narrative: such change may take place around the saint, who as God's agent Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 57</page><page sequence="12">intervenes in the temporal affairs of men to work miracles, but the saint himself does not change; rather he reveals himself to the reader/viewer in a series of discrete epi sodes. Furthermore, the virtues Cuthbert embodies are kept continuously alive by the members of his community at Durham. In the depiction of some of Cuthbert's miracles, the issue of sequential time, while present, is minimized in order to emphasize the means of cure, rather than the fact of sudden and miraculous change. Several cures are worked not by Cuthbert himself, but by objects intimately associated with the saint during his lifetime. This is the case with the cure of Abbess Aelfflaed and her nun by Cuthbert's girdle (zona), which takes place during Cuthbert's lifetime (p. 69), and with the posthumous mira cle of the paralytic cured when Cuthbert's shoes (calciamenta) are placed on his feet (p. 124). In both illustrations the emphasis is not simply on the cure itself, which is still in process, but on the objects that work the cure, the girdle and the shoes, which are represented twice in each pair of scenes. The girdle is first presented to Aelfflaed and then wrapped around the forehead of her nun; the shoes are obtained by the sick man's servant and then placed on his feet as he reclines in his sickbed. Both objects, the shoes and the girdle, are documented at Durham47 The monks of Durham treasured not simply the incorrupt body of their patron saint, but also a whole range of objects associated with Cuthbert, and some of these relics, like the body itself, were commemorated in the miniatures.48 As Richard Southern has noted, "No community had more physical objects which recalled its past than Dur ham. . . ,"49 Like the saint's body these physical objects are a distinctively tangible means of linking the community's past with its present. In the illustrations, the miracles are depicted in the process of unfolding before our eyes, just as Cuthbert, through his relics, remains continuously present and available to his petitioners.50 Architectural Metaphors of the Monastic Life In Chapter 17 of the Vita prosaica Bede describes Cuthbert's retreat to a soli tary hermit's life on the island of Farne after many years spent in the community at Lindisfarne.51 The artist ignores Bede's account of how Cuthbert expelled demons from the remote site and concentrates instead on the building of Cuthbert's cell (F ig. 7).52 Bede says that Cuthbert constructed his home not of cut stone or bricks and mortar, but of unworked stone and of turf ("non de secto lapide uel latere et cemento, sed impolitis prorus lapidibus et cespite"), with a roof of rough-hewn timber and straw ("de lignis informibus et foeno").53 Some of the stones were so large that Cuthbert was able to move them only with angelic aid. The artist shows two figures, Cuthbert and an angel, lifting a huge and prominently displayed rectangular stone.

(Photo: The Master and Fellows ofUniversity College, Oxford.) a second scene Cuthbert is shown alone, lifting a similar block in front of the completed cell, which appears to be constructed almost entirely out of finely worked stone. In some respects the miniature is extremely faithful to the text, in particular the description of a round building with a single opening to the sky, designed to lift the hermit's mind to higher things.54 However, the artist's deliberate and selective empha sis on the construction process, as well as his use of building materials that directly contradict Bede's text, both require explanation. Bede provides a clue to the interpretation of this drawing. In describing how Cuthbert expelled demons from Farne Island, he employs a well-known image from St. Paul's Letter to the Ephesians: the saint is described as the soldier of Christ, armed with the "helmet of salvation, the shield of faith, and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God" (Eph. 6:16—17). Bede then relates how, following his triumph, "this soldier of Christ [Cuthbert] ... built a city fitted for his rule, and in it houses equally suited to the city."55 Yet Bede next goes on to describe not an actual city, but the single structure Cuthbert built for his own retreat, with mention of an additional guest house for visitors. Bede's language, as well as the accompanying drawing, call to mind an earlier passage in Ephesians: Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 59</page><page sequence="14">So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you are also built into it for a dwelling place of God in the Spirit (Eph. 2:19-22). Like the imagery of spiritual combat, this architectural imagery must be inter preted metaphorically rather than simply literally. Both images center on the process of spiritual formation and perfection. Cynthia Hahn has stressed the importance of architectural imagery in the lives of the saints, which often played on the dual sense of the term aedifico, meaning "to improve" as well as "to build."56 In the Oxford Vita this general metaphor is given explicit visual expression. By depicting both the con struction process and the resulting structure itself, the artist of the Oxford Vita mini mizes the heroics of isolated combat, instead linking the theme of individual spiritual perfection with the benefits of communal life, a life "constructed," literally as well as spiritually, on the model of a saintly predecessor. In so doing, the image reconfigures Cuthbert's legacy in light of concerns specific to the monastic reform of the Anglo Norman era. The large stone in the Oxford manuscript might be interpreted as a reference to Christ as the cornerstone of the Church, an image found in Ephesians, a text alluded to in Bede's Vita. However, Christ himself is not depicted, and the artist's emphasis is not on the building's foundation, as one might expect with the image of Christ as the cornerstone.57 Rather, multiple stones are used to form the walls, with emphasis on the materials, on the process of construction, and on the completed cell itself. This suggests that the image is concerned less with Christ than with his successors. The First Letter of Peter, which cites passages from Isaiah 28:16 and Matthew 21:42 de scribing Christ as the cornerstone, calls on Christians to become "as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, accept able to God by Jesus Christ" ( 1 Pet. 2:4—5).58 In the Oxford manuscript, this imagery is rendered explicit. The prominent rectangular stones, accompanying a text that clearly describes a structure built of unworked stone and of turf with a roof of rough hewn timber and straw, illustrate the notion of living stones as a metaphor for the followers of Christ, those who form a spiritual edifice, the Church.59 The metaphor of the living stones occurs frequently in patristic and early Chris tian authors, including Augustine, Ambrose, and Gregory the Great. It was further elaborated by Bede in texts such as the Historia Ecclesiastica and especially the De Templo, in which the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem is interpreted mystically as a figure of the Church built by Christ.60 In Bede's words the Lord is the "precious cornerstone laid in the foundation," and the faithful are "living stones built upon the 60 First Illustrated life of St. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="15">foundation of the apostles and prophets, i.e. on the Lord himself," echoing the language in 1 Peter 2:5-6 and Ephesians 2:20.61 Jennifer O'Reilly has shown the rele vance of this imagery for the Temptation miniature in the Book of Kells (fol. 202v), where the Temple building can be read as both the incarnate body of Jesus and as the Church, made up of living stones comprising all of the faithful, with Jesus as the chief cornerstone. O'Reilly reads this miniature in the context of patristic exegesis of the Lucan genealogy of Christ, the text of which precedes the Temple miniature in the Book of Kells. She suggests that the Kells miniature be viewed as the Church on earth but also as the mystical body of Christ, beyond spatial and temporal limitations, to be completed in Heaven only at the end of time (Fig. 8).62 Use of the "living stone" metaphor in the Oxford Vita is at once more literal and less mystical. Instead of the strangely anthropomorphic building in the Kells minia ture, with its compressed rows of little figures and a bust-length figure of Christ placed at the summit, the Oxford artist shows an actual building block. The distinc tive feature in the Oxford drawing is the emphasis on smooth, rectangular blocks, as opposed to the unworked stone described in Bede's Vita Cuthberti. The highly fin ished and polished quality of the stones depicted in the Oxford Vita, as well as then even, regular shape, can be seen as a metaphor for moral and spiritual perfection.63 This notion is familiar from Augustine, occurring in the Enarrationes in Psalmos as well as the De Civitate Dei.M It is found as well in the writings of Gregory the Great and Bede. In his interpretation of Ezekiel, Gregory compares the saints with the square stones of the four altars for burnt offerings in front of the heavenly temple. He notes that a square stone stands straight upon each of its sides, like saints who have been tested by both adversity and prosperity. Gregory goes on to view this image from a broader perspective: just as these holy men are to be understood as setting an example for the faithful to emulate, so too are the square stones seen as the building materials of God's Church.65 This imagery is elaborated and refined by Bede in his De Templo. As a meta phor of righteousness the image of the squared stone, stable and upright, applies to Christ himself and to all of the elect, who strive to learn from the example of the prophets and the apostles. Reiterating Gregory's image of the squared stone as liter ally and spiritually upright, he goes on to stress how ... precious stones are hewn when, as a result of the instruction and zeal of the saints who have gone before them, each of the elect gets rid of whatever is harmful or vain in himself, and in the sight of his creator exemplifies only the norm of righteousness implanted in him as the stable form of a square.66 Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 61</page><page sequence="16">Figure 8.

The key to understanding the precise significance of the "living stone" imagery in the Oxford Vita is the juxtaposition of the rectangular block held by Cuthbert and the angel with a depiction of the saint's completed cell. Several passages from the Dominus vobiscum of St. Peter Damian (1007-72) suggest an explanation for this linkage.70 Damian's text, a letter to the hermit Leo, is an extended treatise on the vir tues of the eremitic life. It concludes with an elaborate series of metaphorical images for the hermit's cell, which Damian praises for making men "squared stones, fit for building the wall of the heavenly Jerusalem; they will not be shifted by the incon stancy of their behavior but will remain immovable in their serious following of holy religion."71 The cell is "a prison-house where precious stones are polished so that they may be used afterward to adorn the temple "72 Damian is also concerned to show that each individual, although he prays alone in his cell, is yet united with all of the faithful in the mystical body of Christ. For this too he uses an architectural metaphor. Just as each of the faithful receives the sacraments and speaks the prayers common to the whole Church, so too is each himself a "little Church" ("Ecclesia minor").73 If the stone block depicted in the Oxford Vita Cuthberti is a metaphor of Cuthbert's spiritual perfection, the adjacent cell evokes the way of life that enables Cuthbert to obtain that perfection. Enclosed and isolated, the site of rigorous ascetic practices, of prayer and fasting, the cell embodies the "spiritual sacrifices" of the Petrine text: "Ye also, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ" (1 Pet. 2:4-5). Although written in praise of the solitary life, the imagery of the Dominus vo biscum is resonant with a sense of mystical (and even physical) community. Damian describes the hermitage as composed of "monks' cells raised like rows of tents in a camp" ("cella monachorum velut tentoria ordinata castrorum").74 A specifically mo nastic reading of the "living stone" imagery is found in the Diadema Monachorum Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 63</page><page sequence="18">of Smaragdus (d. ca. 840), where a full chapter is devoted to advising monks to become living stones built upon Christ into a spiritual temple.75 Monastic life was tra ditionally interpreted as a living martyrdom. The monk's asceticism was a literal self sacrifice, performed in emulation of Christ's own self-offering and the sufferings of the martyrs of the early Church.76 In his commentaiy In Primam Epistolam Petri, Bede describes the "spiritual sacrifices" ("hostias spirituales") of the Petrine text as "eleemosynas et preces," or charity and prayers.77 Gregory the Great explains how, through their lives of self-mortification, monks become a sacrifice (holocaust) which is offered to God.78 In his concluding chapter of the Diadema monachorum, Smarag dus establishes a parallel between the consecration performed at the altar of the physical church and the consecration of the faithful, who themselves possess two altars, the body and the heart. The context of this imagery is specifically monastic. Offering to God sacrifices of good works and chastity on the altars of their own hearts and bodies, monks are purified by their communal and ascetic life to become a spiritual house of God.79 The image in the Oxford Vita Cuthberti is a direct visualization of these themes. It establishes Cuthbert himself as a squared stone, but it also makes clear how that spiritual perfection may be achieved by others who follow his example. Taken by it self, the large squared block of stone would serve as a metaphor for Cuthbert's own spiritual perfection. Yet there is clearly more at stake here than a celebration of Cuth bert's isolated asceticism By depicting a building composed of many stones, as well as the process of construction itself, the artist celebrates the life of the Church as it develops through time, both historically and spiritually. In other words, he expresses visually Bede's own sense of the Church. After describing the foundation stones laid by the apostles, Bede advises the faithful "to continue upward the wall of good works, superimposing on each other, as it were, courses of stones by the life we lead and by advancing from virtue to virtue."80 Interpreted literally, as a straightforward narrative act, the right-hand portion of the illustration is illogical, since the hermitage appears to be complete and there is no open space into which the stone may be inserted. In one sense the saint, the stone, and the hermit's cell are discrete units, yet Cuthbert holds the stone in a way that sug gests their commonalty, even identity. He is as large as the cell, and the curvature of his body conforms to its shape, as though the cell has formed him physically as well as spiritually. Both saint and stone overlap the cell to suggest the equivalence of all three elements: the smooth, regular stone conveys the spiritual perfection of the man of God, achieved through the disciplined life of the hermit's cell. The architectural imagery is neither a (relatively) realistic illustration of medieval building practices, nor an explicit statement of corporate institutional power, as might be the case with 64 First Illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="19">other illustrated vitae,81 but rather a multivalent visual metaphor, encompassing both the nature of Cuthbert's spiritual perfection and the means by which that perfection might be emulated by others. The image in the Oxford Vita Cuthberti is concerned less with the general no tion of the Church unfolding historically and mystically over time, than with a more specific celebration of the reformed church at Durham, which preserved Cuthbert's body and whose monks personified the saint's spiritual ideals. As Abou-El-Haj has observed, depictions of architecture in illustrated vitae are often anachronistic, com parable not to the structures described in the text but rather to the ambitious building campaigns contemporary with the manuscripts' production.82 As depicted in the Oxford Vita, Cuthbert's cell may refer, not simply to Cuthbert's modest structure on the Island of Farne, but also, both literally as well as metaphorically, to the actual building of the new cathedral of Durham, whose first stones were laid in 1093 by Bishop William and Prior Turgot.83 Support for interpreting the spiritual significance of the manuscript's architec tural imagery more broadly is found in Symeon of Durham's account of Cuthbert's life as an anchorite on the island of Farne, a life described by Symeon as centered on the image of the house of the Lord ("domus Domini"), which, as A. J. Piper has noted, was an established synonym for a church or monastery.84 The vast scale of Durham cathedral, conceived, as Malcolm Thurlby has argued, in emulation of Old St. Peter's, Rome, was intended to rival and even surpass recently constructed Anglo Norman churches.85 Such an ambitious construction project required an enormous quantity of meticulously worked masonry blocks, constituting what Jean Bony has termed "a virtuoso performance in rationalized stonework."86 In general terms, the prominently featured stone blocks in the Oxford Vita, with their precisely detailed borders, may be a deliberate reference to contemporary building activity at Durham. Furthermore, the artist also includes more explicit references to the contempo rary building campaign. The illustration to Chapter 20, depicting Cuthbert disci plining two crows who had picked at the thatch on the roof of the guest house at Farne, shows a structure similar to the saint's cell (Fig. 9). This is overlaid by a sec ond building, drawn to a smaller scale and composed of three stories, with a small apse-like addition to the right. Specific features of this enigmatic structure recur at a later point in the manuscript in depictions of Cuthbert's shrine at Durham These include the tall, narrow wooden door of the cell, with a rounded profile and elaborate metal hardware (Fig. 1), and the multi-storeyed tower with an apse (Fig. 2). The artist thereby conflates the saint's cell, which originally enclosed his body, and the new Romanesque church then under construction to house his miraculously preserved relics.

It should be noted here that the original manuscript of Symeon's Historia Dunel mensis Ecclesiae, still preserved in Durham, contains as part of the prefatory mate rial a list of all the bishops of Durham, beginning with Aidan, who founded the see at Lindisfarne; this is followed by a list of all those who as monks "have made profes sion before the incorruptible body of the most holy Cuthbert," with the injunction that future scribes add to both lists the names of those to come.87 In the opening chapter 66 First Illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="21">of his text, Symeon describes Sts. Oswald and Aidan, who established the episcopal see at Lindisfarne, as the foundations of the church of Durham ("primitiva fiinda menta ecclesiae Dunelmi").88 The symbolism of the living stones in the Oxford Vita Cuthberti recalls the im agery of the living Ecclesia analyzed by Robert Deshman in several tenth-century Anglo-Saxon manuscripts, where a number of miniatures create "a symbolic equiva lency between the architectural components of the material church and the faithful who with Christ constitute the spiritual edifice of the Church."89 Exploring in detail the imagery of the cornerstone, the column, and the altar as they apply to individual leaders of the Anglo-Saxon church as well as to exemplary features of monastic life, Deshman established a link between this imagery of the living Ecclesia and the con temporary movement of monastic reform90 As was the case at Durham at the end of the eleventh century, at Winchester during the tenth century the vigorous promotion of a saint's cult helped to create support for the potentially controversial replacement of secular canons with monks. F or our purposes the most telling instance of architec tural symbolism is the image of St. Swithun, Bishop of Winchester (852-62), whose body is assimilated to the central shaft of the column in the architectural framework enclosing his full-length portrait in the Benedictional ofAethelwold (Fig. 10). Similar imagery is found in the liturgy commemorating the translation of Swithun's relics in 971, where Swithun is described as an "Olympic column of shining glory, illustrious with miraculous splendor"; he is also compared to "one of the apostles," who in Galatians 2:9 are described as symbolic columns of the Church.91 The verbal and pictorial equation of Swithun with a column coincides with the saint' s literal incorpo ration into the fabric of the newly renovated cathedral.92 The metaphor of the living stones in the Oxford Vita Cuthberti is neither as ex tensive nor as liturgically sophisticated as the vision of the living Ecclesia in the Benedictional of Aethelwold, but I would suggest that in the later manuscript there is a similar link between the symbolic use of architectural forms and the contempo rary movement of monastic reform In keeping with the context of a private devotion al manuscript, the imagery in the Oxford Vita is more closely focused on establishing Cuthbert as a model to be emulated by the members of his monastic community. This is in keeping with the guiding theme of the reform at Durham, the introduction of a purified monastic life according to the example of St. Cuthbert. Many of the texts cited in the discussion of architectural imagery derive from commonly available patristic sources and might be presumed to have been part of the cultural baggage of those responsible for the Oxford Vita. Fortunately, our argument can rest on firmer ground. The manufacture and acquisition of essential texts was a primary concern of newly-installed Norman prelates such as William of St.-Calais.93 Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 67</page><page sequence="22">Figure 10.

A list of forty-nine manuscripts given by William to the cathedral priory at Durham is recorded in the CarilefBible, itself part of William's donation.94 The origin of this and other Durham manuscripts is a subject of debate.95 For our purposes here the essential point is that we can document the Durham monks' famil iarity with architectural metaphors of the monastic life. Among the manuscripts in cluded on William's list, some of which can be identified as works still preserved at Durham, are several of the sources of the architectural imagery discussed above: Au gustine's De Civitate Dei and Enarrationes in Psalmos; Gregory the Great's Com mentary on Ezekiel, and Bede's Historia Ecclesiastical William's list also contains the Diadema monachorum of Smaragdus, which does not appear to have survived.97 Among the Durham manuscripts dated by Mynors to the earlier twelfth century is a copy of Peter Damian's Dominus vobiscum,98 The image of the square stone as a metaphor for the virtuous man was still current in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, appearing in the writings of Anselm of Canterbury (d. 1109) and his followers.99 Moses, Benedict, and the Vita Apostolica Many of the themes developed in the image of Cuthbert's cell are continued and enriched in the miniature for the next chapter (Ch. 18), which describes Cuthbert's life as a hermit (Fig. 11). Here there is a particularly interesting deviation from the text. Bede describes how Cuthbert instructed his followers to dig a pit in the hard, dry, rocky ground in the midst of his dwelling, and the next day it was found to be full of water. This miracle is similar to one performed by St. Benedict, noted by Bede as a comparison.100 Closer in some ways to the visual image are the water miracles of Moses, which were in fact cited in the anonymous prose life of Cuthbert that formed one of Bede's primary sources.101 In place of a literal rendition of Bede's text, the artist of the Oxford manuscript has made the comparison with Moses explicit by adapting his image from the long pictorial tradition for Moses striking water from the rock in the desert. Instead of bubbling up overnight to fill a pit dug in the center of Cuthbert's dwelling, the water poms forth, instantly, from a vertical rock located out side the cell. The water miracle of Moses (Exod. 17:6; Num. 20:11) is one of the oldest and most common episodes in early Christian art.102 In a hagiographie context, transposition of a similar miracle, in verbal or pictorial form, could establish a saint as a "new Moses."103 Herbert Kessler has shown how the water miracle of Moses was applied to St. Peter in a fourth-century ivory, before the story entered the textual tra ditions of Peter's life.104 The Moses episode is one of several Old Testament parallels cited by Gregory the Great in his Life of St. Benedict, and the visual tradition for this Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 69</page><page sequence="24">loticje abcafbtifcoumdc uftb; acc^moduf arvtu ttotn |Kitnif4.\quarn dc anda ptvdurmt. tiel cjualtcer ykt tnAclraieft wivetttr-' Figure 11. Cuthbert's miracle of the water. Life of St. Cuthbert (Durham, ca. 1100); Oxford, University College, MS 165, p. 58. (Photo: The Master and Fellows of University College, Oxford.) episode may have affected the illustration of Benedict's water miracle in the eleventh century manuscript from Monte Cassino.105 In the text as well as the illustrations for both Benedict and Cuthbert it is the saint's followers, rather than the holy man him self, who actually strike the rock. The artist of the Vatican Vita Benedicti follows Gregory's description of how water was produced on a mountain top as a result of the saint's prayer. By depicting water flowing from a vertical rock, instead of bub bling up from the ground as in Bede's account, the artist of the Oxford Vita takes greater liberties with the text in order to emphasize the comparison with both Moses and Benedict. The connection between Benedict and Cuthbert recurs in several other passages of Bede's Vita. When he was preaching, Cuthbert extinguished a phantom fire, a mir acle which, as Bede informs us, is similar to one performed by Benedict.106 The epi sode of the ravens who atone for their vandalism of Cuthbert's guest house on Farne is described as performed "after the example of father Benedict" ("in exemplum 70 First Illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="25">patris Benedicti").107 Although Bede himself does not draw the connection, the episode of the demoniac boy healed with water that had been used to bathe Cuthbert's body after relics of other martyrs had proven unequal to the task, was patterned on a comparable example in Gregory's Vita of the superiority of Benedict's healing pow er.108 Cuthbert's gift of prophecy, a sign of his increasing spiritual potency, is described in words borrowed directly from the Vita Benedicti.109 But the connection between these two figures goes beyond a few textual citations. Bede's overall concep tion of Cuthbert as a synthesis of the active and the contemplative, the monk and the bishop, the ascetic and the preacher, may have been modeled on the Gregorian ideal outlined in the Regula Pastoralis and specifically exemplified in the Vita Benedicti.110 Cuthbert's close association with Benedict is emphasized in the miniature depicting the choir of the confessors from the Anglo-Saxon Benedictional ofAethelwold. Bene dict, the founder of Benedictine monasticism, is flanked by Gregory the Great, who introduced Benedictine monasticism to the Anglo-Saxons, and by Cuthbert, who embodied the full expression of Benedictine ideals in Britain.111 Cuthbert's association with Moses is found in two more images from the Ox ford manuscript, both of which illustrate post-Bedan material. A Scottish army attacked Lindisfarne, and through the intervention of the saint the ground opened up and swallowed the Scots alive. In the words of the miracle text, quoted directly from Psalm 106:17, it was as when the enemies ofMoses were punished: "the earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram" (p. 153).112 A second episode also deals with miraculous deliverance. Escaping the wrath of William the Conqueror, the guardians of Cuthbert's body flee to Lindisfarne when the tide is high; despite this they reach the island with dry feet. Here the analogy with Moses, made explicit in the text by reference to the miraculous delivery of the Hebrews during the flight from Egypt, is depicted visually as a parting of the waters (F ig. 12), a reference to the passage from Exodus 15:19 quoted in the miracle text: . . the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea."113 The Old Testament analogy is accentuated by the depiction of Cuthbert's remains, for their shape and method of transport echo depictions of the Ark of the Covenant. Taken together, these three mir acles establish Cuthbert as the successor of the Old Testament leaders. As in the time ofMoses and Joshua, so now does God, through his agent Cuthbert, punish the wick ed and protect the faithful. The promise of God's special covenant with the Hebrew people is both recapitulated and fulfilled in the relationship between Cuthbert and his community.114 The image of Cuthbert as a new Moses, already established in the illustrations to Bede's Vita, is continued and elaborated in the post-Bedan miracles. Significantly, however, the substance of the comparison changes, in keeping with the Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 71</page><page sequence="26">Y)tc qq; He qelteituifle arthnbimratnuru quuti dL\yfCW qfic emtitttc n timet dudtutttu i ntt • Qmcoipaic tptt Itt lditfan m ifc"mflila ppitiqtrcc .ftucc n^famlratKannrgy|q:jgtijj^tccilVcdtb; nitfrciK: &amp;3M m kTtlC lb deiruJe pdiuttp namctv dnrapcu mdUmflhti't^ptn tytlkltrfretprare&lt;£pif ' (pu|(W tec.'ormtte quencid rccWcu uoabuLo nartbdn hubvzmt vtawtn tfectr4lte cu tmktnelmam Figure 12.

(Photo: The Master and Fellows ofUniversity College, Oxford.) post-Bedan transformation of Cuthbert's personality from a benign miracle-worker to a vengeful protector of his people. What is especially distinctive about the image in the Oxford Vita Cuthberti is the combination of the water miracle with a scene of foot washing, placed inside a structure similar to that depicted externally in the preceding drawing of Cuthbert building his cell. Bede explains how Cuthbert would minister to his brethren by wash ing their feet in warm water, and how he would reluctantly allow them to wash his feet, once annually, onMaundy Thursday.115 Yet the decision to illustrate the washing of the feet is itself unusual, for Bede's point is that Cuthbert sought to avoid washing of any sort, most likely in emulation of the tradition of extreme asceticism found in the earlier Life of St. Anthony. Bede's text culminates in the description of Cuthbert's ascetic withdrawal and isolation in his cell: "... he shut himself up in his hermitage, and, remote from the gaze of men, he learned to live a solitary life of fasting, prayers, and vigils . . conversing only rarely with visitors, he kept his window shut whenever possible.116 By choosing to depict instead the scene of foot washing, itself 72 First Illustrated Life cfSt. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="27">something of a textual aside to Bede's main point, and by pairing this scene with the water miracle, the artist establishes a distinctive constellation of references. The ultimate pictorial model is likely to have been a scene of Christ washing the feet of his disciples (John 13:1—20).117 During the Last Supper Christ bathed the dis ciples' feet as an example of humility; he then commanded them to perform similar foot washing for each other (John 13:14-15). Reenactment of Christ's commandment (mandatum; John 13:34), emphasizing as it did the themes of humility, charity, and community, soon became an established ritual of monastic life.118 In the Benedictine Rule, a copy of which was provided for Durham by Bishop William, the celebration of Maundy Thursday was supplemented by a regular weekly washing as part of the kitchen service performed by each monk (Ch. 35). The Rule also specifies washing the feet of guests, in particular pilgrims and the poor (Ch. 53).119 The mandatum re ceived special emphasis in the Regularis Concordia, a guide for English monastic houses attributed to Aethelwold, Bishop of Winchester (d. 984).120 What is in some ways the closest iconographie parallel to Cuthbert's foot washing is the depiction of the maundy of the brethren in the Canterbury Harley Psalter, where the scene is one of several Anglo-Saxon additions to the Utrecht Psalter tradition that have been linked with contemporary monastic life and ritual (Fig. 13).121 An elaborate man datum of the poor and of the monks is featured in the Constitutions of Lanfranc (d. 1089), appointed Archbishop ofCanterbury by William the Conqueror.122 Lanfranc's work was written as a guide for the monastic cathedral of Christ Church, but there is evidence that the Constitutions also structured the reform at Durham A copy writ ten at Canterbury in the early 1090s is found in one of the manuscripts listed as gifts to Durham from Bishop William, the same manuscript, in fact, that contained William's copy of the Benedictine Rule.m Together, the miracle of the spring and the scene of foot washing create an image of the purifying and life-giving power of water. The figure holding a shovel, who points to the rock and looks toward the foot-washing scene, links the two epi sodes and suggests an affinity between the two waters. Both images have sacramental implications. Along with other episodes from Exodus, such as the Crossing of the Red Sea, the water miracle of Moses was interpreted in patristic exegesis as a prototype of the Christian sacraments. Paul identified the rock with Christ (1 Cor. 10:2—4), and the Church Fathers saw in the blood and water flowing from the side of Christ a fig ure of the Eucharist and, more often, Baptism124 Although the Roman church tended to view foot washing primarily as an act of charity and humility, and disassociated the sacrament of Baptism from the Holy Thursday Maundy, the ritual could be interpreted as a metaphor for the spiritual cleansing conferred by Baptism125 For Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 73</page><page sequence="28">fNitfidnf cuftodierrr ciuira Cum d Ton. tnuunu uiapl^uir (om tj | quicuftodiunream tafdi I nuttnum eft uobif ante tuT u A 1 v — •n Ti II' &gt;: W /7?^» 5 Figure 13.

(Photo: By permission of the British Library, London.) example, Bede considered foot washing a paradigm for the remission of sins, a means of "spiritual purification of the flesh and mind."126 In the Oxford Vita Cuthberti the baptismal implications of foot washing have a distinctively monastic inflection. The act of monastic profession was itself tradition ally interpreted, like martyrdom, as a second Baptism127 Bernard of Clairvaux makes an explicit connection between the two: You have also asked my opinion on monastic profession considered as a second bap tism. Why has our way of life rather than other penitential callings merited the prerog ative of this appellation? ... It makes those who live it and love it stand out from other men as rivals of the angels and hardly men at all; for it restores the divine image in the human soul and makes us Christ like, much as Baptism does . . . ,128 These associations would have endowed the mandatum imagery with special meaning for the newly reformed monastic community at Durham As Susan Von Daum Tholl has suggested, both the performance and the depiction of foot washing in a monastic context might be interpreted as a symbolic renewal of the monks' vows. The ritual of foot washing "makes tangible Benedict's Rule and the fundamental virtues of the mo nastic vocation.'"29 This is especially likely in the Oxford Vita, where the depiction of the mandatum exhibits a special variation peculiar to Durham. For the artist depicts neither Christ washing the feet of the disciples nor Cuthbert washing the feet 74 First Illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="29">of his followers, but Cuthbert allowing his feet to be washed by a fellow monk The monk's gesture might perhaps be seen as anticipating the care administered to Cuth bert's body by the subsequent guardians of his relics.130 Placed inside Cuthbert's cell, a structure that originally held the saint's body and served as an emblem of his spiritual formation, the depiction of the mandatum in the Oxford Vita becomes an image of monastic life at the cathedral of Durham, a life centered physically as well as spiritually on the body of St. Cuthbert. Monastic reenactment of the original Maundy Thursday ceremony in the ritual of the mandatum is but one manifestation of a larger contemporary movement to re form religious life based on the ideal of the vita apostolica, in emulation of Christ's communal relations with the apostles (Acts 4:3 2).131 The monastic reform at Durham, and in particular the revivified devotion to Cuthbert, are very much in keeping with this general trend. Spiritually and historically, Cuthbert links post-Conquest Durham to the heroic era of English monasticism, which was itself constructed on the Apos tolic model. Bede describes Cuthbert's itinerant preaching as "after the manner of the Apostles" ("more apostolorum").132 The distinctive arrangement of the cathedral church at Lindisfarne, where the community was composed of monks and the bishop himself lived according to the monastic rule, was ascribed by Bede to Gregory the Great, who advised Augustine of Canterbury that bishops should live under the mo nastic rule in emulation of the customs of the early Church.133 Cuthbert's original wooden coffin was decorated with portraits of the apostles.134 Four centuries after Bede, Symeon of Durham justified Bishop William's replacement of the secular can ons with monks as a restitution of the arrangements sanctioned by St. Cuthbert,135 who himself had reformed life at Lindisfarne.136 As Symeon was careful to point out, Bishop William's action was sanctioned by a bull, exhibited to the crowd, from the "apostolic Pope," who himself received authority from "the blessed Peter, chief of the Apostles."137 Cuthbert's apostolic qualities were celebrated in the liturgy at Durham, where he is described as a virtual apostle, "quasi unum ex apostolis," in the feast for the octave of his translation.138 Finally, we should note that this liturgy, as well as the translation itself, transpired in a newly constructed architectural setting designed to emulate the distinctive structures of Old St. Peter's in Rome. Eric Fernie and Malcolm Thurlby have argued that the spiral piers and rib vaults in the presbytery and transept arcades at Durham were intended as a deliberate reference to the spiral columns and the openwork ribs used to construct the canopy over the shrine of St. Peter. Bishop William's new cathedral formed a monumental architectural shrine for Cuthbert, effectively linking the patron saint of Durham with the ultimate apostolic model.139 Studies in Iconography 21 — 2000 75</page><page sequence="30">Considered as a group, the hagiographie narratives of the Oxford Vita Cuthberti provide a striking instance of what has been called the abolition of sequen tial time, whereby the past is absorbed in and relived by the present, to construct a continuously valid spiritual truth.140 The individual narratives of Cuthbert's illus trated Vita exemplify in microcosm the larger import of the monastic reform. For the reintroduction of monks at Durham elides the past with the present by linking Cuth bert's present-day community at Durham with the saint's own lived experience; both of these eras, in turn, exemplify the original communal life of the apostles established in the early church by Christ himself. All of spiritual history collapses in the figure of Cuthbert, who is described by Symeon, citing the liturgy of Durham, as personi fying "angelic chastity, prophetic dignity, and apostolic virtue."141 The juxtaposed images of the miraculous spring and the foot washing suggest, visually, Cuthbert's special role as heir to the dual traditions of the Old and New Testaments; he is the successor of Moses as well as Christ. By re-enacting a miracle on the model of earlier saints, like Peter and Benedict, Cuthbert embodies both the continuity of God's grace and its transferral to the English people, most specifically the reformed monastic church of Durham. By depicting the washing of Cuthbert's feet inside the saint's cell, the artist anticipates the care of Cuthbert's incorrupt body by his monks in the new cathedral of Durham In verbal as well as pictorial form, the text and the illustrations of the Oxford Vita Cuthberti construct a continuous chain of ideal exemplars to be emulated by the reformed monks of Durham Bede repeatedly stresses how Cuthbert taught his fol lowers "by the words of his preaching as well as by the example of his virtue."142 In so doing he himself followed the example set by the missionaries accompanying Au gustine of Canterbury, who "practiced what they preached," in "[emulation of] the life of the apostles and the primitive church";143 like the apostles, Cuthbert "taught others to do only what he first practiced himself."144 Bede presents Cuthbert as an ideal to be emulated: "by his own example [he] would show the sinner what he ought to do," thereby "[arousing] in all good men the desire to imitate him"145 The theme of teaching by word and by deed is also stressed by Symeon of Durham, who borrows much of Bede's language and adds the injunction that those who now serve Cuthbert should learn from his example.146 The spiritual perfection of the monastic life at Dur ham, based on the model of their illustrious patron, allows Cuthbert's monks to be come as living stones of the heavenly Jerusalem Yet in one fundamental sense Cuthbert is unique and inimitable: enclosed within the carefully tended shrine, his incorrupt body defies the earthly passage of time to anticipate the state of the blessed in Heaven. 76 First Illustrated Life of St. Cuthbert</page><page sequence="31">NOTES 1.

R. Howard Bloch and Stephen G. Nichols (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996), 371—401. 6. Malcolm Baker linked both the Oxford Vita and, especially, the later London manuscript to the history of Cuthbert's monks at Durham ("Medieval Dlustrations," 17, 30-40). Also notable is the work of Barbara Abou-El-Haj, who related the Oxford manuscript to the orchestration of Cuthbert's cult in the decades following the Conquest, placing special emphasis on the translation of 1104 and on the punitive miracles associated with the consolidation of Cuthbert's patrimony. See Medieval Cult of Saints, 39-40, 51-60, and Barbara Abou-El-Haj, "Saint Cuthbert: The Post-Conquest Appro priation of an Anglo-Saxon Cult," in Holy Men and Holy Women: Old English Prose Saints ' Lives and Their Contexts, ed.

Farmer, "A Note on the Origin, Purpose and Date of University College, Oxford, MS 165," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 41 (1978): 46-49, who argues for an earlier date (ca. 1092) based on patronage (see below, n. 30). According to Colgrave the seven miracula included in the Oxford Vita occurred between 877 and 1080; they were written down together by a monk of Durham between 1083 and 1104, and probably nearer to the earlier than the later date. A second group of miracles, not included in the Oxford manu script, was probably composed very early in the twelfth century, just before the translation of 1104 ("Post-Bedan Miracles," 327—28). There is no reference in the Oxford manuscript to the translation celebrated in 1104 (see below, n. 26). Nevertheless, art historians have tended to prefer a later date, based on stylistic evidence. See, for example, T. S. R. Boase, English Art, 1100—1216 (Oxford: Clar endon Press, 1953), 28; Kauffmann, Romanesque Manuscripts, 66 (ca. 1100—1120); and Alexander and Temple, Manuscripts in Oxford, 4 (ca. 1120). More recently, Kauffmann appears to have accepted the earlier dating; see his entry in English Romanesque Art, 92 (ca. 1100), as well as his summary of Baker, "Medieval Elustrations," in Art and Patronage, 61-62. A date of ca. 1100 is given in C. R. Dodwell, The Pictorial Arts of the West 800—1200 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993), 120. On the paléographie evidence see N. R.

Farmer ("Note," 48-49) proposed Margaret of Scotland (d. 1093 ) as patron, a suggestion rendered problematic by the early date of her death. John Crook has shown that Cuthbert's shrine was rela tively inaccessible to lay pilgrims in the immediate post-Conquest period, which suggests that the shrine may have been more important to the resident monks; see "The Architectural Setting of the Cult of St. Cuthbert in Durham Cathedral," in Anglo-Norman Durham, 235—50. Victoria Tudor has noted that until about 1170 few of the twelfth-century healing miracles attributed to Cuthbert actually occurred at the saint's shrine itself; see "The Cult of St. Cuthbert in the Twelfth Century: The Evi dence of Reginald of Durham," in Cuthbert, Cult and Community, 455—56. A possible candidate as patron of the Oxford Vita within the Durham community is Turgot, one of Aldwin's early compan ions, who accompanied him to Durham and succeeded him as prior (1087—1109). On Turgot's career see Aird, "Absent Friend," 292—97; and Wall, "Malcolm ID," 325—32. The library at Durham is ex ceptionally well documented (see A. J.

Watson [London: Scolar Press, 1978], 213-49 and below, nn. 93—94), and it is noteworthy that despite clear ties with Durham on the basis of style, iconography, and paleography, the Oxford Vita cannot be identified in any of the Durham catalogues. 31.

The Oxford Vita was linked to the monastic reform of 1083 by Baker, "Medieval Illustrations," 32—33. Baker was pri marily concerned with contrasting the depiction of Cuthbert in the two extant illustrated vitae; because he considered the Oxford manuscript to be closer to the original spirit of Bede and St. Cuthbert than the later work in London, he minimized the selective and interpretive qualities of the earlier set of images. 34.

Colgrave, Two Lives, 248—49. 41. A similar narrative structure is found in the illustration to Chapter 34 (p. 94), which juxtaposes two spatially distinct but simultaneous events: while seated at a banquet, Cuthbert saw the soul of a man who was killed by falling from a tree ascend into heaven. Cuthbert's eyes were fixed in amaze ment, his limbs relaxed, and "the knife he was holding suddenly fell to the table"; it was later re vealed that at that very moment, the man expired by falling from the tree (Colgrave, Two Lives, 262-65). 42.

Shoes (sandals) were placed on the saint's feet at his burial in 687 and removed at the elevation of 698 (see Battiscombe, Relics of St. Cuthbert, 20-24, 64, 73—74); sandals are also mentioned in Reginald of Durham's account of the translation of 1104 (ibid., 111). The linen girdle {zona linea) described by Bede might have become confused with an object (cingulum) listed among the gifts presented to Cuthbert by King Athelstan in 934 (ibid., 13—14, 33); a girdle is also listed in the relic inventory at Lindisfame (ibid., 67). 48. Compare the discussion of Guthlac's scourge and psalter in Kimberly Kelly, "Forgery, Invention, and Propaganda: Factors behind the Production of the Guthlac Roll (British Museum Harley Roll Y.6)," Athanor 8 (1989): 1-13, esp. 3. 49. Richard Southern, "Aspects of the European Tradition ofHistorical Writing: 4. The Sense ofthe Past," Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 5th Ser., 23 (1973): 251. Additional objects should also be investigated along similar lines; for example, the saint's crosier, featured in a number of miniatures (see Battiscombe, Relics of St. Cuthbert, 19, 68). The drawing on p. 132 illustrates a miraculous cure performed by hair removed from Cuthbert's body at the original translation (see Bede, Historia ecclesiastica, 4.32; Battiscombe, Relics of St. Cuthbert, 24). This relic was not housed at Durham, but it is significant that here the artist shows not simply the cure, but also (as Bede describes) the relic being replaced in its chest, a clear contrast with the adjacent images of theft and desecration of the saint's shrine (reproduced in Boase, English Art, fig. 6c). 50. As Ihave argued elsewhere, this hagiographie phenomenon is comparable to the narrative imme diacy characteristic of Early Christian loca sane ta images, created to commemorate holy sites from the life of Christ; see Magdalena Carrasco, "Spirituality in Context: The Romanesque Illustrated Life of St. Radegund of Poitiers (Poitiers, Bibl. Mun. MS 250)," Art Bulletin 72 (1990): 429-30. 51. Colgrave, Two Lives, 214—17. 52. Bede himself places less emphasis on combat with the devil than is found in other vitae in fluenced by the model of St. Anthony, such as those of Martin and Guthlac; see Colgrave, Two Lives, 325. See also, for example, Clare Stancliffe, St. Martin and his Hagiographer: History and Miracle in Sulpicius Severus (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1983), 233—41. The illustrations in the Oxford Vita eliminate such imagery altogether. 53. Colgrave, Two Lives, 216—17. 54. For Cuthbert's actual cell see Colgrave, Two Lives, 326, 349.

The short box shown here is in contrast to the actual appearance of Cuthbert's coffin, for we know he was not dismembered but preserved whole and incorrupt. Depictions in the Oxford manuscript vary between the long rectangle, more faithful to the original coffin, and the elaborate chest, a reflection of the contemporary tradition of relic chests as well as, at least in this instance, an explicit reference to the Ark of the Covenant.

Within the Vita Cuthberti itself the miracle of the spring might also be seen in the context of a whole range of water miracles, which often have sacramental implications; the healing and purifying quality of water is evoked, for example, in miracle cures caused by holy water (chs. 25, 29; pp. 76, 86). Abou-El-Haj, Medieval Cult of Saints, 43—44, notes the equation of physical and spiritual healing in the miracle cures performed by saints. 125. Kantorowicz, "Baptism"; Dene H.
