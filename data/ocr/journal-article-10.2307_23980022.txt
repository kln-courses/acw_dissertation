<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EX LEGE RITE OF PASSAGE IN HARTMANN'S IWEIN T. L. MARKEY THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN In Hartmann's Iwein, the lion, the beast by which Iwein came to be identi fied as der rîter mittem lern (Ii Chevaliers au lyott), appears as an emblematic object which effects a unification of thematic structures at a point of recog nition. In this romance, as in innumerable folktales - and both Chrétien's Yvain and Hartmann's rendition represent amalgamations of mythical and folkloristic elements -, a hero on a quest comes upon a bestial compan ion, a lion, long a topic of scholarly controversy. The lion has been variously interpreted as a symbol of strength, of trust, of justice, of gratitude, the bestial side of mankind, and as a personifica tion of Christ. Julian Harris1 and, more recently, Tom Artin1 have inter preted the lion as a symbol of Christ; the former in light of the animal's traditional liturgical associations and the latter by exegetical equivalence (lion = lamb): et molt pansent qu'il soit preudon por la conpaignie au lyon qui ausi dolcement se gist lez lui com uns aigniax feist (Yv. 4003-4006) daz der lewe bî im lac und anders sites niene pflac niuwan als ein ander schâf.3 {Iiv. 4815-4817) We contend that comprehension of the lion's function and symbolic force is best achieved by locating it within the over-all pattern of the tale and reference to certain legal institutions and customs deeply embedded in Western tradition which implementation of the lion obliquely reflects. The critical perspective achieved by this essentially anthropological analysis permits interpretation of a problematic symbol in an Arthurian romance as emblematic of an archaic ritual convention and thereby sug gests an approach for further investigation. After having failed to honor Laudine's demand that he return within a year, Iwein, her experienced but immature husband, chooses to leave court ly society, the collective society of Arthurian knights as opposed to the</page><page sequence="2">9 8 T. L. Mar key personal society between Laudine and Iwein, the primary «other society» in the tale, and commit himself to a quest to gain self-esteem, insight, and honor and thereby regain the good graces of his beloved Laudine and readmission to both the collective and personal societies of the tale.4 By having broken a promise made in the private society, Iwein has also violated the rules of corteisie, the code which governed the collective soci ety, and Iwein's violation therefore compels him to become ex lege, an outcast from both. He then embarks upon a series of adventures and thus undergoes a rite de passage, the only course remaining to Iwein if he is to redeem himself and become worthy of Laudine once again. Only a true knight was worthy of adventure (aventure), a gradual test of election en tailed by the chivalric «doctrine of personal perfection through a devel opment dictated by fate»,5 the credo which delineates the very essence of the knight's ideal of manhood. Iwein gradually overcomes the madness incurred after departure from courtly society; first (Iw. 3261-3282) through the agency of a lad who miraculously appears and provides him with a bow and arrows so that he may hunt for his sustenance, then ([Iw. 3283-3358) via a hermit who gives him food, and finally (Iw. 5359-3702) through the agency of the three ladies who come upon him naked and one of whom swabs him with the ointment from Morgan the Wise which restores him to health. Mentally and physically revived, Iwein is then able to engage in the first true adventure of the quest, delivery of the Countess of Nârisôn from the attack of Duke Alier (Iw. 3703-3827). We note that the Duke is not confronted by Iwein in single combat, but is forced to surrender after Iwein has slain many of his men. Interestingly enough, the lion's appear ance in the subsequent section is foreshadowed in Chrétien's version of this adventure in a metaphoric aside lacking in Hartmann: Tot autresi antr'ax se fiert con li lyons antre les dains quant l'engoisse et chace la fains. (Yv. 3198-3200) Having taken leave of the Countess, Iwein (Iw. 2828-3922) encounters a lion engaged in mortal combat with a serpent (wurm, actually &lt;dragon&gt; der wurm was stare undegrô/ da% viur im dem munde schô%. Iw. 3841-3 842). As a result of the preceding adventure, Iwein has apparently acquired a modicum of pensive self-awareness ; for, upon sighting the lion and the serpent, he hesitates (%wîvel) and considers whether it would be more suitable to help the «noble» lion or the serpent (Iw. 3846-3849). He de cides to aid the lion, despite his fear that, once the serpent has been slain,</page><page sequence="3">The Ex Lege Rite of Passage 99 the lion may attack him. In gratitude for his aid, the lion prostrates itself before Iwein and becomes his faithful companion and helpful servant until, upon the conclusion of his adventures, he is reunited with Laudine and Arthur's court. The lion makes its appearance near the middle of Hartmann's tale; but, after the lion has become allied with Iwein, it is only upon success ful completion of the next adventure (Im. 4357-5144), the struggle with Harpin and attendant deliverance of Gawain's sister and her family, that Iwein takes the lion as his emblem : vrâger iuch wiech sî genant, sô tuot im daz erkant daz ein lewe mit mir si: dâ erkennet er mich bi.' {Im. 5123-5126, cf. Yv. 4283-4297) The order of incident's in Iwein's confrontation with the lion and cer tain elements they express signal a rite of identification. Their meeting concludes with a communal meal. The lion slays a deer, drinks its warm blood, and conveys it to Iwein, who roasts it and eats it while the lion looks on. Afterward, the lion finishes the remainder of the roasted deer: an animal partakes of human fare, and a man of animal fare. The cooked : ram :: human : animal oppositions are obviated in an act which denotes reciprocal identification of beast and man. The lion then watches over Iwein as a feral child while he sleeps, after which both set forth in com munal manner for precisely fourteen days until Iwein once again comes upon the fountain (Im. 3923-4010). Upon sighting the magic mountain, Iwein recalls the loss of Laudine, laments his fate, faints, topples from his horse, and his sword falls from its scabbard and pierces his hauberk. The lion then believes that its master is dead and attempts to kill itself by piercing its abdomen with Iwein's sword : the lion has identified with Iwein so strongly that it attempts to commit a sort of suttee. Iwein then contemplates suicide, but his realiza tion (Im. 4001 -400 5 ) that the lion's actions represent identification with and dependence on him dissuade him. He has begun to rationalize his solipsism and accept «other directed» responsibility, his duty as a knight. Iwein's rescue of the lion is his first decisive act since departure from society that is in dependent of supernatural (the lad with the bow and arrows, the ointment) intervention or natural (the hermit) aid : his success in the Alier episode (Im. 3703-3827) was made possible by administration of the ointment. From this point on the Zmeieinheit of Iwein and lion becomes ever stronger and more cohesive as displayed by successively intense episodic</page><page sequence="4">ioo T. L.

The union between knight and beast is forged in a tableau replete with the elements of ritual.6 In incidental order, Iwein, the ex lege, hesitates (%wivel) when confronted with the binary opposition of serpentjevil : lion/good, for he is oblivious of an ethical presence or symbolic value. Evil is slain, whereupon the lion in gratitude ençeict im sine minne (Iw. 3873) and an oath is concluded between knight and lion un^ si beide schiet der tôt (Iw. 3882). A communal meal celebrates this bond and obviates former dichotomies (cooked : raw :: human : animal). The lion then watches over the sleeping Iwein and is described (Iw. 3914-39x6) as having character istics (tugent, sin) which confer a certain nobility on the bond between them. They are then permitted to wander without social contact for what seems a prescribed period of rehte vierçehen tage (Iw. 3919. cf. 5621). Reci procal identification entailed by the lion's attempted suicide informs Iwein that the lion is possessed of rehtiu triuwe (Iw. 4005), the very value Iwein's past actions have negated and which his future actions are de signed to achieve. The lion, which is grateful, compassionate, helpful, understanding, sympathetic, and outstanding in combat (slaughter of ein rich) is immediately contrasted with Iwein as a paradigm of the very knightly values he has negated and must now regain. The serpent is Iwein's past, the lion his future.7 Iwein's lament of his fate prior to the fall from his horse is overheard by Lunete, who has been imprisoned in the chapel beside the fountain. When he learns of her impending doom, he is prepared to accept the responsibility of combat that her fate might be averted and sets forth to do her bidding (Iw. 4011-4356). He is interrupted in completing this mission by the Harpin espisode (Iw. 4357-5x44), at the conclusion of which, as we have seen, he takes the lion as his nominal emblem. During his conversation with Lunete, to whom he remains unknown until he identifies himself, Lunete takes no note of the lion. As he departs to do her bidding, there is merely parenthetic mention, as an afterthought, that the lion is still in train: sin lewe volget im als ê (Iw. 43 5 8). In the Harpin espisode, the lion follows Iwein to battle against the giant (Iw. 4990), lends him support at the crucial moment, and thereby makes victory possible (Iw. 5050-5065). It appears urxlikely that Iwein could have slain Harpin without the lion's help, and thereafter he accepts it as his emblem. In Chrétien (Yv. 3783-3796), though not in Hartmann, the lion's role as one of decisive significance is foreshadowed when we are told at the</page><page sequence="8">104 T. L. Mar key outset that the retainers were afraid to let the lion enter the castle. Iwein's insistence that it be admitted informs us how dependant he has become and may well be on the lion. As indicated by the Plot Component Outline, the Harpin episode is struc turally parallel to the Pesme-Aventure (In&gt;. 6080-6854) episode. In both Iwein is impeded from completing tasks undertaken as a lady's champion. In both the lion makes victory possible; but, whereas the lion is free to enter combat in the Harpin episode, it is not in the Pesme-Aventure episode. These are fated interpolations which interrupt promised service and which test Iwein's sense of purposive punctuality. In the rescue of Lunete (Jn&gt;. 5145-5 574), the factor of punctuality enters for the first time since Iwein withdrew from society: he returns from the Harpin episode just in time to save Lunete, who has already been placed on the pyre. He thus shows that he is not only aware of the flaw (failure to return at a designed time) which compelled him to withdraw from society, but also able to surmount it. At the conclusion of the rescue episode, Iwein reaffirms fealty to the lion, denies recognition by any emblem other than the lion, and requests that Lunete keep his actual identity secret. He identifies nominally with the lion (hv. 5496-5 506) : the identification between lion and knight which began with a communal meal thus culminates with metonymical assig nation. Moreover, there is, within the terms of chivalric ethos, the even more powerful bond of physical reciprocity. Iwein requests {Iw. 5615 5616) that the lion, regarded as a knight wounded in combat, receive care, the second instance of Iwein's provision of physical aid after slaying the serpent. As shown by the Plot Component Outline, in the Harpin, Lunete-rescue, and Pesme-Aventure episodes there is progressive effectuation of distance between the lion and Iwein in combat : it is first free to enter combat, then commanded to withdraw, and finally locked in a chamber. Iwein is thus gradually divorced from the lion in preparation for single combat when he engages Gawain and is then (Jw. 6902-6906, cf. Yv. 5916-5918) de void of the identifiable emblem he acquired and needed while excluded from courtly society. Iwein proceeds by juxtaposed incidents of parallel order without ab solute componential identity (lion's position, etc.), periodic withdrawal from and re-entry into the primary societies of the courtly world, identity with the lion when outside society, and revelation of personal identity when re-accepted into society: the lion forms Iwein's identity while an ex lege.</page><page sequence="9">The Ex Lege Rite of Passage 105 In formulating the Plot Component Outline, we have not established binary oppositions, nor sets of equivalences, but merely factored out components essential for diagrammatic display of the lion's function, as well as the over-riding theme of punctuality. These macro-constituents, ranked horizontally in order of occurrence (aid to Iwein, - lion, etc.), are presumably common to the source (s) used by Chrétien (and Hartmann) and therefore lie at the core of the tale in its earliest pre-romance form. According to Stith Thompson,8 the timely aid of animals helped by a hero who thereby gains an animal's gratitude and aid in accomplishing an end is a very common folktale motif. Moreover, animals are more common than human or supernatural helpers and are substituted for them with considerable freedom. According to Antti Aarne,» the lion is un known as a helpful wild beast, though the bear, rabbit, squirrel, fox, and wolf all make frequent appearances in European folktales. Furthermore, as in Iwein, the hero generally encounters the animal when it is in flight from certain danger. Thus, the functional qualities attributed to the lion in Iwein are elements common to the folktale, while the lion per se is not. The figura of the lion is well known from Classical mythology, where, for example, we find the lion of Androcles, of the Aesopic fables, and, more congruently here, of Nemea. The first of the twelve labors com manded of Hercules by Eurystheus was to slay the Nemean lion. Hercules then clothes himself in the lion's skin, and in plastic art Hercules was traditionally represented as naked but for this skin: he thus identified with the lion while excluded from society to perform his labors. The Bible is filled with lions, but their symbolic value is contradictory, being both positive and negative. Daniel is placed in the den, both Samson and David kill lions as feats of strength, the princes of Israel are likened to lions in the lamentation for the princes (E^ekiel 19:1-9), prophets who disobey God are slain by Hons (1 Kings 13:24, 20:36), valiant men are said to have the heart of a lion (2 Samuel 17:10), the wicked watch in dens like Hons to catch the poor (Psalm 10:9), the devil is said to walk about Hke a roaring lion (1 Peter 5:8), while the righteous are as bold as a lion {Proverbs 28:1). BibUcal references do not permit unequivocal equation of Hons with God, Christ, or Satan: all are possible. Bestiaries are, of course, our primary sources of information about animal symboHsm in medieval verbal and plastic art; the spiritual values they assigned animals were regarded as authoritative, and the best-known was the Physiologus, in which the Hon appears as the first of (usuaüy) twelve animals.10 The Hon is described as having three characteristics which are likened to those of Christ; it represents Christ. Details vary</page><page sequence="10">io6 T. L. Mar key according to redaction, but the following account of the lion, its charac teristics, and their scriptural analogues is representative. First, the lion dwells on the highest mountain, and, when it descends, it wipes its tracks clean with its tail if it senses a hunter approaching; just so, Christ dwells in the highest heaven and his arrival on earth as the Son of God was hid den. Second, lions cubs are born dead until the third day; just so, Christ remained dead in the sepulchre until the third day. Third, the lion never sleeps with its eyes shut ; just so, Christ never closes his eyes on his flock. In the later Middle Ages and early Renaissance, spiritual values assigned animals became increasingly diffuse, while scriptural analogues of animal characteristics were never rigidly fixed, and we noted that no one trait characterizes the Biblical lion. It is on extremely tenuous grounds that one could equate the lion with Christ as an absolute. The textual evidence in Iwein provides little support for such an equation: connection of the lion as watchful in Iwein with this as one of its traits in the Physiologies is of slight probative value. The one value commonly ascribed the lion in Classical mythology, the Bible, and bestiaries, as well as the popular imagination, is that it is primus inter pares, the king of beasts, and indic ative of royal power. Note the anthropomorphic role of the lion as king in the beast epic (e. g. Le Roman de Renart) and frequency as the primary symbol of regality in armorial bearings. We suggest that, in Iwein, an animal of lower order from the folktale motif of «helper» has been replaced by an animal of the highest order in myth become romance. The lion enters the romance at a point of recog nition crucial for both the narrative and the ethos which governs it. As an emblematic object, it symbolizes that recognition and increasingly manifests a unity of theme; namely, the necessity of social inclusion for the conduct of courtly society. As a symbol of sovereignty, the appear ance of the lion signals Iwein's ability to regain moral regality and even tually re-enter the «societies» he has voluntarily abandoned. The investigated portion of Iwein has a tripartite structure : severance of the hero from society, adventures during an intermediate state as an effectual ex lege, and final reunion with society. These macro-episodic units can be correlated with Arnold van Gennep's" three fundamental «transitional rites»: i) rites préliminaires designating separation from a previous state, 2) rites liminaires executed during an intermediary state, and 3) rites postliminaires designating unification with a new state.12 Ac cording to van Gennep, the intermediary state (2) denotes a stage in which one exists beyond society and without fixed rules of conduct, a period of license wherein one has an attitude estranged from restrictive</page><page sequence="11">The Ex Lege Rite of Passage 107 taboos. The intermediary state is engendered by a desire for disorder or counter-order and has its raison d'être in the reversal of normal order. Rituals pertaining to this state are usually prescribed as periodic. Of significance here is the fact that is during the intermediate state with Iwein as ex lege that we witness periodic reversal of normal order; an animal functions as a knight effecting victory in combat, and a man periodically assumes bestial qualities. Attributes of ritual punctuate Iwein's tripartite structure articulated in rites of passage. We have touched upon mythical elements in Iwein and note that anthropologists have long recognized that rites and their prac tice are enshrined in myths, frequently for mnemonic convenience in conveying the very essence of cultural attitudes." On the other hand, medievalists have long realized that the folkloristic and mythical matière de Bretagne forms the elemental framework employed to elaborate the knightly ideal in courtly romance. Romance was fused with myth to afford coexistence of the credible and incredible; courtly romance has both an artistic plane, the product of poetical intent, and a mythical plane with roots sprung from Western (Indo-European) tradition. On the artistic plane, the lion is necessarily an objective correlative of courtly society; while symbolically, on the mythical plane, it is an integer of ritual expression deriving from early totemic identification. In The Sociological Theory of Totémisme A. R. Radcliffe-Brown treated totemism as the ritual expression of an interdependence between social order and the natural environment, a stance which caused Lévi-Strauss to exert a critical attitude in Le totémisme aujourd'huiwherein he con cludes that it is a categorical imperative that one learn to distinguish one's fellow men according to social status and that the simplest way of doing so is by translating social classifications into animal categories. Just so, while an ex lege, Iwein is distinguished by identification with the lion, at once a symbol of bestiality and sovereignty. Identification of the ex lege with animals has a common Indo-European heritage. Michael Jacoby16 has shown that the Latinized Germanic term wargus (&lt;criminal, wolf&gt;) was associated with a specific delict; namely, the desecration and robbing of graves, and the practitioners were excluded from society as ex lege. For example, in the Lex Ribuaria (c. 745) we find: (Art. 85.2) Si autem eum ex homo traxerit et expoliaverit, CC solidos cum capi tale et dilaturas culpabilis iudicetur, vel wargus sit (hoc est expulsus), usque ad parentibus satisfecerit. This persisted through the 13 th century in Northern Europe, and gradually the term and those charged with committing the delict were</page><page sequence="12">io8 T. L. Mar key associated with wolves. In contemporary East Scandinavian the original term for wolf, ülfr, was replaced by varg from earlier vargr. In as fascinating article devoted to analysis of animal categories and verbal abuse, " Edmond Leach established categorization of animal taboos based on a classificatory system involving binary oppositions : [± edible, ± distance from self]. Animals assigned a negative value in the former and a positive in the latter category may, like the fox in the hunt, be circumscribed by elaborate rituals. In life and literature the lion was, as we have seen, so specified and, like the fox, circumscribed by variant symbolic values. Interpretation of the lion as symbolic of Christ is unfounded. Hartmann makes metaphoric reference to the lion as a schâf and thereby reveals his independence from Chrétien's lion as aigniax. Iwein's hesitation when initially confronted with the lion shows that he is oblivious of its symbolic value and certainly its value as a figura for Christ. The lion's willingness to give its life for Iwein might be indicative of Christian symbolism were the attempt not realized as suicidal. Finally, lack of consistently unambig uous Biblical equation of the lion with Christ excludes their equivalence. As a paradigmatic extension of knightly virtues, the lion replaces the serpent as Iwein's alter ego and thereby an animal of lower order. Then, too, it denotes exclusion from society in an ex lege rite of passage and yet affords accomplishment of punctuality for the person with whom it is identified; it is thereby realized as the embodiment of thematic unity, for thus was the tortured material of inherited myth integrated with the chivalric ethos in the articulation of romance.

Le chevalier au Hon (Yvain), Les classiques français de moyen âge, 89 (Paris: Champion, 1963) and those from Hartmann (Im.) are from Ludwig Wolff's edition of the Benecke-Lachmann text, Iwein: Eine Erzählung von Hartmann von Aue, 7th ed. (Berlin: Wal ter de Gruyter, 1968). Note that Hartmann here exhibits emblematic distance from Chré tien, for Hartmann's lerne: scbâf is not equivalent to Chrétien's lyon: aigniax. There is no suggestive force in Hartmann's polarity which permits exegetical equivalence of the lion with Christ, as schâf is in opposition to lamp. 4 By enumerating a «primary» collective and a «secondary» private society, I do not intend even proximate equivalence of the two, for the set of intrinsic obligations pertaining to either is quite distinct, though the highest societal value, triume, in the rules of corteisie regulates both. As a seduced perjurer and a knight incapable of honoring punctuality in ful filling promised obligations, Iwein has violated this value. Cf. infra. We recall that there is no real compassion for Iwein at Arthur's court, nor is there any regret on the part of Gawein as seducer. Note the parallel of Cundries' condemnation in Wolfram's Parfival. 5 Erich Auerbach, Mimesis, p. 118. 6 Identifiable properties of ritual are: sequential order of incident, fixed and sanctioned pat terns of behavior, role/status reversal noted in obviation of discernible dichotomies or reci procal exchange, sometimes between opposites, both of which signify identification, effec tuation of magic (imitative, sympathetic, exuvial, etc.), formulaic expression (dance, incan tation, etc.), and implementation of symbols, either arbitrary or purposive. In Iwein we ob serve a form of sympathetic magic, by far the most prevalent literary type, as the hero identi fies with the lion. 7 The opposition serpent I lion is echoed in Hartmann's Erec by der wtze hirz : sparwaere : : Arthur : Erec-Enite and in Gottfried's Tristan by der wtze hirz ■ eher : : list : kunst as emblematic of Tristan's dual nature, cf.

L. Mar key further defines rites of passage as: «... ceux qui accompagnent tout changement de place, d'état, de situation sociale et d'âge. Ces cérémonies sont, pour leur idée centrale et leur forme générale, calquées sur les passages matériels, ... et comportent régulièrement trois stades équivalents : celui de séparation, celui d'attente ou de marge et celui d'agrégation. » 13 As pointed out by Lévi-Strauss, « Structure et dialectique », in For Roman Jakobson, Essays on the Occasion of His Sixtieth Birthday (The Hague: Mouton, 1956), 289-94, absolute homology between myth and ritual is demonstrably rare. Then too, almost every rite is open to variant interpretation and, hence categorization. Nevertheless the two fundamental categories of ritual are: 1) collective = concerned with groups and 2) private = associated with the affairs of individuals. Rites may or may not be profane, may or may not be employed to effect magic, and may or may not be intimately related to social structures. Their original signifi cance may subsequently become obscured, though they may then persist as artifacts incor porated into a radically altered cultural schema, particularly when they serve an aesthetic purpose, e. g. frequently in the coextensive relationships between pagan and Christian worlds in the Middle Ages, see Donald R.
