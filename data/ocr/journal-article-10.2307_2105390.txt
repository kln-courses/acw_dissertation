<plain_text><page sequence="1">FORM, CONTENT, AND CATEGORIES IN ART 1 Although I think it true that art does not "say" anything. a great deal can and ought to be said about art. Firstly, art, and I mean by this all art, is not concerned with "telling" something; it is concerned with "making" something. We ought, once and for all, to recognize this and the implications which follow from it. Secondly, the artistic product, what is made, differs from all other products. It is a new, nonnatural entity which exists as a formed unity of disparate and distinguishable parts. Thirdly, the artistic product, by virtue of exhibiting the victory of form over matter, the surrender of what was non-ego to what is ego, the transformation of the alien into the subjectified, produces a magical resolution and clarity within its audience. The work of art, on this view, presupposes three things. Firstly, a material stuff to be formed; secondly, a consciousness with the power to create and externalize form; thirdly, the actual embodiment of that con- sciously created form in that material stuff. All else is artistically deriva- tive, and, to some extent, irrelevant. It also means, by implication, that the work of art has what I shall call three projections. Firstly, it projects being as such - it stands before consciousness as a content which limits and constrains consciousness, which, in a word, affects and awakens consciousness. Secondly, it projects being as some being, being as this or that kind of being, i.e., it thrusts upon consciousness being as e.g., shape ordered in such and such a manner, sounds related in such and such a manner, or words and images arranged in such and such a manner. Thirdly, it projects being as novel and unique being, as a new and qualitatively different addition to the sum total of things, or, what comes to the same thing, contents of con- sciousness. The proper stance, then, before a work of art is complete alertness and receptivity to its being as such, its particularity and individuality, and its newness. Alertness and receptivity to its being as such means standing before it naked, so to speak, open to it purely as being, as pure content with ontological or metaphysical categories such as real, unreal 169</page><page sequence="2">170 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH appearance, illusion, subjective, and objective entirely suspended. One must approach it, as Kant so wisely suggested, "without a concept" - in a word, using Husserl's term, phenomenologically. Only in this way can one encounter, and respond to, what is perhaps its elementary attraction - the mystery of it merely existing here and now before one's con- sciousness. Alertness and receptivity to its newness means that one must assume that it is nameless, original, and unassimilable to any other thing in the world. One must stand before it as before an object found on a strange planet, eager to digest its sensuous reality and intelligible construction, to know it in its perceptual and conceptual completeness but, for that very reason, humble before it. Naming and assimilating before such unadulterated experience is insensitivity and aesthetic blindness. It is the stance of the "hunter" (which has many experiential forms) and not the lover of art. Primary aesthetic experience is, then, of being as such and novel being. Secondary aesthetic experience, and this distinction is, as the medievals would say, a distinction of reason and not of res, is of particular being, i.e., what sort of being it is and how its being is cemented and revealed within its composition. This level of interaction is primarily one of expe- rience of structure - in a word, how and whether the work subdues its parts to its total tendency or gestalt. On the perceptual level, the response to structure ranges from inte- gration and fusion to unrelatedness and bare juxtaposition. This, of course, is a continuum. On the conceptual level, the reponse ranges from lucidity and clarity to density and unintelligibility. This means that the reaction to the succesful work is neither delectation, awe, pleausre, divinity, or harmony (to name a fey suggested by traditional aesthetics) - it is power and vision: power in that some consciousness has overcome some matter, vision into the eternal dialectic of consciousness, i.e., the necessity of consciousness to objectify itself and to transform what is alien into an extension of consciousness. All this is, paradoxically, not necessarily the avowed aim of all artists nor the immediate signification of their work. It is however the common empirical denominator of art-works and articulates an internally con- sistent aesthetic theory. It must stand therefore as the criterion for all art. Insofar as art has actualized itself it has done so within these limits. We suggest that insofar as art would actualize itself it must also do so within these limits. Assuming these limits, the distinction between art and non-art is pre- cisely the distinction between being which is qualified and made par- ticular as "formed" being, and being which has become particularized primarily not through form but through some other agency. By form I</page><page sequence="3">FORM, CONTENT, AND CATEGORIES IN ART 171 mean configuration or structure. By some other agency I mean such individuating properties as function, value, or meaning. Assuming these limits, the distinction between good and bad art is the ,distinction between an appropriate and victorious form and an inappro- priate and defeated form. The notions of a victorious and a defeated form need little clarification. In essence a victorious form is one which com- pletely penetrates its raw material; it "transpierces" its material to use Hegel's word, and shines through it like a "thousand-headed Argus" to use another Hegelian notion. A defeated form is one which neither over- comes its material nor emanates from it. The, concepts appropriateness and inappropriateness of form do, however, require some explication. In order to do this, we must digress a bit and amplify the notion of matter which, hitherto, we have left undefined and ambiguous. Aristotle meant by matter, in at least one sense of that word, the stuff out of which a thing was constructed. Speaking of a bronze statute he says, "By the matter, I mean ... the bronze. . ." I His actual definition is a bit more complex and inclusive, but let us avoid unnecessary com- plexity for the moment. The substratum of a thing would seem to mean simply the material part of it - the bronze of the statue, the wood of the table, the metal of the typewriter. In this signification, matter would perhaps be more precisely located by material or stuff. In this signifi- cation, the matter of a work of art is clearly its material, i.e., the sound in music, color and shape in painting, bronze or some equivalent in sculpture, the moving body in the dance, the' word in poetry, etc. Now it is surely the case that art begins and ends with matter. Croce and Collingwood merely have become hypnotized by an idealist meta- physic when they minimize and even eliminate the actual physical thing in their theories of art. That an aesthetic response is more than mere physical stimulation is certainly true; that it is "essentially" spiritual is not true or rather is only half-true. The precise magic of the work of art lies, on one level, in its sensuousness, and more particularly, in a sensuousness which has become "desensed" or honed down so that its materiality has become less material. Aesthetic emotion is emotion over a "broken" or subdued materiality, an alien stuff which has become drenched and domesticated by conscious form. Croce and Collingwood have correctly seized upon the intelligible, the domesticating power of consciousness, but have failed to see that it is precisely such power as revealed in a concrete material thing that liberates and uplifts. Aristotle, however, also suggests that as potency is to actuality so matter is to form (Metaphysics, Book IX, 1048b). This gives matter a larger signification. Within this meaning, we can include any thing at all 1 Aristotle, Metaphysics, look VII, 1029a.</page><page sequence="4">172 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH which is shaped or structured. Content, then, is also matter in the sense of that which is "at hand" to be set into a pattern, organized, integrated. or, in a word, enformed. Matter as content enlarges our field so that what we might ordinarily call the non-material parts of a work of art are now, formally, its material parts. Emotions, ideas, stories, polemic, moral exhortations, ideologies, and the like are all matter. Before returning to the concepts which initiated this digression, it is now opportune to define the notion of form which, again, like matter, we have merely used without detailed analysis. In the light of the above dual aspect of matter, forn becomes the consciously created and objectified schema or organizational arrangement within which mat- ter as material or content is placed. It is the mode of relating and reali- zing the material components, of setting them against each other and igniting the aesthetic tension. Form which has become stabilized and codified is style e.g., the sonata form, the Gothic, Abstract Expres- sionism, the "stream of consciousness." Form which is born in the indi- vidual encounter with matter is genius, or less honorifically, primary creation de novo. We have said that the work of art begins and ends with matter i.e., with material and content. It is equally important to add immediately that it could not be at all without form. The beginning and end of a thing are, after all, somewhat arbitrary. When does an art work begin? A new canvas is stretched, an image is vaguely pictured in some mind, a tune captivates a musician, a piece of steel glitters when held to the light at a certain angle - all these are beginnings. But strictly speaking the birth of the artist is the beginning of his work as is the physical coming into being of his material as is the historical and cultural genera- tion of his content. And when does an art work end? With the final period? The last brush stroke? The inevitable stillness of the dancer's body? Surely these are ends, but the work also lingers on in the passions and minds of its viewers. It continues as the repertoire of all men insofar as access to it is possible or memory of it still exists. Beginnings and endings are contingent, or more precisely, stipulated - being in the first place is not. To be as a work of art is to be enformed. This is a neces- sary truth immune from the triviality of tautology or, if one is overly formal and quarrelsome, tautologous in some profound and edifying sense. Thus, having form, being material or content set in some inte- grated network of relationships, is being artful. It is now perhaps time to respond to a charge which undoubtedly has arisen in your minds or, at least, should have. With the introduction of content as matter, and with content being principally part of proposi- tional discourse, the work of art now has a dimension of "telling" some-</page><page sequence="5">FORM, CONTENT, AND CATEGORIES IN ART 173 thing - a dimension expressly declaimed in the very first paragraph of this essay. We have then a contradiction. I confess we have. That is, the charge is justified and no amount of qualification can remove its force. Any defense which does not recognize this is simpleminded. But any defense which hides from it is insensitive to its subject matter. That works of art have "told" things is undeniable. That art, at least some art, now does is also undeniable. That art does so as art, as enformed being, is deniable. For as art, content is one pos- sibility, as contingent as all possibility, having a being of "grace" and not necessity. By definition the work of art begins and ends in matter which has become enformed; what is necessary is some matter, not necessarily matter as content. Moreover, content as formed is no longer content; to be content and to be formed content are two phenomeno- logically different things. In a sense, everything is content, i.e., possible or actual data for consciousness. What is primary, of course, is the relationships within content, the drama of their development and inter- lacing. One easily states some proposition, one does not easily make a structural unity of image or color or sound which exudes a proposition. Content as alive within a formal pattern and as significant within that pattern, as that pattern, is aesthetic content. In this form, the art work does not "tell" something; it is that some- thing. The content of a proposition is contained within it like a liquid within a glass, take away the liquid and the glass still remains. The content of a work of art is that work of art, take away the matter and you destroy the content. The content of a proposition could be stated in a different proposition, as every elementary logic text trium- phantly points out. The content of a work of art cannot be stated in a different work of art. This is true formally and materially; formally by our earlier definition of the work of art as novel being; materially or empirically by Virtue of the undeniable fact that no two works of art do in fact say the same thing. The artist does not firstly have a content and secondly a form so that the content could just as easily be "inserted" into a different form. He has a vague enforced content which, hopefully, becomes less vague in its being objectified.2 Aristotle knew this when he stated that matter and form are metaphysically distinguishable but not empirically distinguishable. Etienne Gilson's distinction between "picturing" and "painting" is 2 I quote one of the many clear statements of this from Igor Stravinsky. "Though I have been concerned with questions of musical manners all my life, I am unable to say precisely what these manners are. That, I think, is because they are not precompositional but of the essence of the musical act: the manner of the saying and the thing said are the same." Encounter, June 1962, p. 33.</page><page sequence="6">174 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH relevant to this part of our discussion. He contrasts the art of "making images" (which I shall interpret as the art of "telling" something) with the art of making a new formed thing. He says, "A painting (the under- lining is mine and not Gilson's) is the embodiment of a form in a mat- ter; the whole being of a picture (again the underlining is mine) is deter- mined by the relationship that obtains between the image itself and some external reality. And since their aim and purpose is to represent things as they are, images have the right to be appreciated from the point of view of their success, or failure, in acheiving their own end. As compared with painting, whose ultimate end is to achieve a fitting object of con- templation, images are characterized by their ambition to represent all the objects they include, and to represent with all the details that are compatible with their pictorial representation." 3 Content as such, like Gilson's "images" is not an intrinsic part of art - it is extra-aesthetic. One can be artful in designing content, but content as such is not artful. It might be fruitful to develop criteria for ranking content just as we have created criteria for ranking art; but even if this were done, the two systems would be independent, at least in the formal sense. The fact that art has projected content, and that great art has projected great content, is always an inconsequential fact from the aesthetic point of view. Insofar as art has manipulated content to make it into form, and insofar as content has worked within a formal structure to reveal the forming consciousness, that is significant. "Telling" and "making" are congenial when, and only when, propositional content has been wrought into an organic, sensuous form. We can now return to our original point, a definition of the concepts appropriateness of form and inappropriateness of form. There does seem to be such a thing as aesthetic necessity, a fact upon which Hegel seemed to build his entire vision of the history of art. It is clearly not logical necessity nor Humean constant conjunction. It is rather a necessity impelled by feeling, imagination, and perception. This does not render it, however, subjective or arbitrary. Being led, unconsciously or through what some have called "inspiration," need not signify mystical appari- tions nor an excess of poetic melodrama. It can mean following out, through imaginative sensibility, the logic of one's form in terms of one's matter. This undoubtedly occurs. No amount of philosophic scientizing can eliminate it. Perhaps, through analysis, philosophy can clarify and learn from it. On the one hand, the raw material which one is dealing with limits and necessitates form. Certain things are aesthetically allowable and 3. E. Gilson, Painting and Reality, Meridian Books, p. 246.</page><page sequence="7">FORM, CONTENT, AND CATEGORIES IN ART 175 workable. Architectural forms which require, often, great space cannot be embodied in sound or images. Musical forms with their emphasis upon temporality and rhythm can only be weakly externalized using mass and color. Tone becomes overly precious when it is used to concretize highly individuated visual forms. Poetic form cannot be sculptured since it, like music, is nourished by time, and sculpture is atemporal. Generalizing, we can say that the pecularities of artistic materials make them prone to certain forms, resist others, and only weakly embody still others. The laws at work are, of course, themselves relative and, to a degree, time- bound. Revolutions in art have often been breakthroughs in the dialectic of forms and raw materials. (Perspective, for example, which allowed architectural or real space, to be captured on canvas). A fertile con- sciousness can often transpose or liberate forms from prior necessities. One such perennial vision is the attempt to make a music of poetry, or to make of architecture a "frozen music" as the saying goes. Necessity then is perhaps better understood as necessity within limits, the limits which the particular matter sets upon the form. In this context, an appropriate form is one which is aesthetically called for, i.e., that lies within the range set up by the material. This, of course, cannot be decided conceptually, but perceptually, or through what I would call the "imaginative intellect". Appropriateness of form is dis- covered only through the actual creative process, in the attempted en- forming of matter in such and such a manner. The above implies, however, a paradox. It implies that every embodied form is an appropriate form since to be embodied at all means to lie within the range of the aesthetic boundaries of the material. An inap- propriate form is inappropriate precisely because it cannot be embodied. One cannot find, then, an actual inappropriate form; and the notion of appropriate form has no verifiable opposite, rendering it meaningless by contemporary criteria. Does this mean that the notions are worthless? I think not, for, aside from the question of the acceptability of the "unfalsifiable-therefore-meaningless" criterion, the notions of appropriate and inappropriate form function on a different level as well. Form serves to actualize matter, to release its potentialities, to trigger it into new and fecund relationships. The Greeks knew this clearly; we lose sight of it often. An appropriate form heightens and stimulates this process; it draws out from the material latent phenomenal qualities; it creates relations and tensions which fuse qualities into larger and inte- grated wholes; it drains matter of its perceptual properties, drawing them out. This occurs, of course, fully, only ideally. In fact, appropriate forms more or less approach this state of complete actualization of matter. But this lack of ideality is inconsequential since the limiting case creates a criterion for using the concept meaningfully - insofar as a form generates</page><page sequence="8">176 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH such perceptual fusions, it is an appropriate form, a form which falters or leaves possibilities still-born is inappropriate. Judging the appropriateness of form is again a matter for the imagi- native intellect. It is the felt experience of the tutored and sensitive person which decides. One can experiment with this by comparing e.g., paintings of the same subject in different styles. Compare a Cezanne nude to a Rubens or Ingres nude; a Mondrian black and white compo- sition to a Franz Kline black and white composition; a Juan Gris still life to a Chardin still life - in these comparisions one can experience the germinating power of a form to release material possibilities (in these cases, the possibilities inherent in color, line, shape, volume, and mass). We have here, once again, the problem mentioned above. Insofar as a form has become embodied it is appropriate, not having therefore a recognizable opposite and, to that extent, being meaningless; but we can still manipulate the concept to point out aesthetic merit, i.e., a good work, a better work, the best work of a certain specified kind. since our limiting case does allow discrimination. We can say with a fair amount of accuracy that, for example, a cubist form generates more visual ten- sions where shape and volumes are concerned than does a baroque form when dealing with a still life, and is, therefore, more aesthetically appro- priate; or that dramatic verse allows more verbal subtleties or purely linguistic tensions than does dramatic prose (for example in Shakespeare's treatment of "high" and "low" personages); or that operatic forms create tonal relations which lieder do not, and so on. Absolute judgments are, perhaps, impossible but they are also unnecessary. We ought to seek the precision our subject matter allows, as Aristotle said. Moreover, making significant judgments does not logically presuppose a scale with an abso- lute top and bottom. We ought to have learned that from Plato's falla- cious arguments to the contrary in the Socratic dialogues. So long as discrimination are possible, relative judgments are also possible. Since matter has a dual aspect, matter as material and content, and form derives its appropriateness and inappropriateness from its relation to matter, appropriateness of form and inappropriateness of form must be discussed with relation to content. Here again we are faced with the notion of aesthetic necessity. All that was said above perfains. Just as material imposes certain aesthetic limits, so does content. Given an idea, an emotion, a story, or a description of a certain kind, formal determi- nations and boundaries spring into being. This is mainly due to the more primitive condition that only aesthetical content is artful and never pro- positional content. As aesthetical content it already obeys certain con- figurational laws. One such law is that content and form are not neutral so that a given content can be placed in different formal containers. As we said above aesthetic content is already formed and is aesthetic content</page><page sequence="9">FORM, CONTENT, AND CATEGORIES IN ART 177 only insofar as it is formed. This means, at the very least, that form and content are not externally related or merely juxtaposed, but that there is an internal, essential connection between them. Carried to its extreme possibility, an again this occurs only, ideally, this internal connection turns out to be utter fusion of content and form so that form exists in and through and as content, and content exists in and through and as form. This can be illustrated by certain near ideal fusions of form and content in works of art. Thus, the other-wordly spirit of the early Romanesque period necessitated the antinaturalism of its cathedrals; the rise in the significance of the earthly and empirical (e.g., as evidenced in Thomistic epistemology) leads to Gothic naturalism; the thunderous "Ode To Joy" demands Beethoven's overwhelmingly strident last movement in the Ninth Symphony; the "flatness" and "dimensionlessness" of Camus' character Meursault in L'Etranger requires the flat and dimensionless language of the first part of that work; the destruction of individuality calls forth De Kooning's faceless subjects; functionalism eliminates superfluity in modem architectural form; meaninglessness and lack of coherence in the modern world structure Beckett's verbal nonsense; the complete atheism of Robbe-Grillet compels the absence of metaphor when describing a natural object (since metaphors signify to this author personification and divination, or conceiving Nature as having an element of consciousness), and so on. Of course, one cannot, again, make rules; the imagination works through its own logic. We can, however, point to the existence of such relations and to the meaningfulness and utility of the concepts of appropriateness and inappropriatesness of form as deriving from them. There is an analogy between form as a catalyst with respect to the phenomenal qualities latent in artistic material and form as a catalyst with respect to the latent possibilities of artistic content. This is perhaps what Croce and Collingwood had in mind when they spoke about the creative process leading to the artist becoming "clear" about some idea or emotion. The artist becomes "clear" about his content precisely by virtue of enforcing it, for in the enforming process a content grows and unfolds its many potentialities. It becomes, as Schiller said, a "living shape" which, by virtue of living, develops a biography. An idea or feeling as such is merely a possibility, a momentary or one-dimensional being. Through form it buds by being set into a relational universe within which interaction, opposition, modification, and crystallization occur. Hegel spoke of "collision" as central to the art work, but collision requires. space, time, and circumstance, a context, which only form creates. Appropriateness and inappropriateness of form refer then, finally,</page><page sequence="10">178 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL- RESEARCH respectively, to the aesthetic aptness of a form to its matter as material and content, and to the actualizing power of a form with respect to its matter as material and content. Judgments can be made as to degress of aptness and actualizing power and, hence, works of art can be ranked in terms of aesthetic excellence. The faculty at work, and one must insist that it is a singular faculty, is the imaginative intellect. The universal feature of art, that which distinguishes it from non-art, and that in terms of which works of art can be judged, is form. Even more fundamental than form, however, is the enforcing process; a process which, in its general functioning, constitutes the essence of human being. As such mind, in its original state, is pure possibility, what Sartre calls a "nothingness" and what I would call, less dramatically, a pro- pensity or power for generating intelligibility, for bringing coherence, relation, and universality into the world. I have no doubt that without consciousness the world would exist, but it would be a Ding an sich, totally lacking the categories within which it has become transparent. There would be a world but it would not be a "worldly" world, using Heidegger's locution, a world impregnated with those intelligible forms in terms of which men have rendered it systematically conceivable. The "worldliness" of the world is the product of consciousness, how con- sciousness has "taken" the world and draped it in familiar "humanizing" structures. I do not, of course, mean simple anthropomorphism - I mean such phenomena as the Kantian forms, what Russell has called logical constructions, Vaihiinger's "fictions", Poincare's conventionalism, and C. I. Lewis' a priori projective categories. All these are products of this tendency of consciousness, the urge of consciousness to objectify itself and transform its environment into an extension of itself. This is what Hegel meant by the dialectical process of mind which he considered constitutive of consciousness (as well as of all things) viz., the capacity to merge opposites into a synthetic unity which contained within it the core-properties of the initial entities in a form or amalgam that trans- figured these core-properties while maintaining them intact. It is what I would call the "subjectifying" tendency of consciousness. It is in terms of this tendency that mind comes to fruition. It grows insofar as it thrusts itself upon its environmental givens and subdues them. This process has a dual character. In the interaction, conscious- ness unfolds the possibilities of its environment and, in doing this, unfolds its own possibilities. In making the world intelligible, it makes itself intelligible; in making the world, it makes itself. I suspect it was this that Croce had in mind when he said that art as intuition is a form of self-knowledge, and what Collingwood meant by calling art a form of self-knowledge. It is only through interaction with the "other" that</page><page sequence="11">FORM, CONTENT, AND CATEGORIES IN ART 179 consciousness develops. Its ultimate form of development, the highest form of self-knowledge, (what Hegel called the Absolute Spirit) what I would call the philosophical consciousness, occurs when men recognize that they create their world in and through the subjectifying process. It is this subjectifying tendency which drives consciousness, and which lies behind the inevitable quest of man for more and more experience - his Faustian essence so to speak. In artistic creation this power is dis- played, indeed paraded, through sensuous forms. The artist symbolizes to his audience the subjectifying process in its most immediate and arresting mode; for he, quite literally, takes some matter and physically endows it with form. Aesthetic emotion, whatever it might be super- ficially, is ultimately metaphysical. It is the vision of this power and predicament of mind which, like the vision of Sisyphus, brings with each new encounter lucidity, awe, awakened humanity, and an awareness of the innumerable encounters still to come.
