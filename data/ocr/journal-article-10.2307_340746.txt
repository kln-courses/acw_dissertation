<plain_text><page sequence="1">RUBEN DARIO AND THE ONENESS OF THE UNIVERSE CATHY L. JRADE Indiana University, Bloomington RUBEN DARIO's intuitive response to and poetic interpretation of the uni- verse were simultaneously reinforced and molded by the intellectual currents with which he came into contact. His sensitivity to the lush tropical environment that sur- rounded him from his birth and his reli- gious and even superstitious character combined to produce a propensity to see God in nature.' This tendency to a panthe- istic view of the world was given impetus by his early familiarity with the writings of Victor Hugo and, shortly thereafter, with the Symbolist poets.2 But it was only after his zealous immersion in occult doctrine that Dario's youthful attitudes began to jell into a coherent conception of the uni- verse as a single living being animated by a single divine soul.3 The occult cosmology to which Dario was drawn is Pythagorean in origin. Be- cause the occult religions posit the unity of all religions-what is commonly called phi- losophia perennis-, Pythagoras is seen, along with the other great religious leaders of the world from Rama to Jesus, as an initiate of the esoteric tradition, and the tenets of Pythagoreanism are considered an intrinsic part of occult doctrine.4 Thus, through the occult, Dario became familiar with the fundamental Pythagorean belief that God is the One that is everything: the Supreme Mind distributed throughout all the parts of the universe, the Cause of all things, and the Power within all things. He absorbed the teaching that both man and the universe were made in the image of God and the corollary belief that it is necessary to understand the order of the macrocosm to hope to imitate it and establish a similar order in the microcosm, that is, to become "orderly of soul." Dario also learned that, although God is present in all things, the elements of the universe are set up in a hierarchy based on their resemblance to God. In order for the human soul to have attained its present position, it had to traverse all the kingdoms of nature, gradually becoming developed through a series of innumerable existences. A blind and indistinct force in the mineral, individualized in the plant, polarized in the sensitivity and instinct of animals, the soul tends toward the conscious monad in this slow unfolding. This faith in the ascending life of the soul through a series of exist- ences-to which Dario was greatly at- tracted-is made possible by the concept of the essential unity of all life. The whole world is akin, for the cosmos is one, eternal, and divine. While the belief in the oneness of the universe permeates all of Dario's poetry, it is at the heart of seven major poems. Six of them will be examined here to demon- strate his varied and subtle use of this con- ception of the cosmos and to shed light on its integration into his poetic vision. The seventh poem, "Coloquio de los cen- tauros," written in 1895, was Dario's first sophisticated utilization of Pythagorean pantheism, but because of its length and complexity, this masterpiece is analyzed in a separate study that seeks to reveal the pervasive impact of this occult cosmology upon it.5 As Dario himself later indicated, the poem concerns "las fuerzas naturales, el misterio de la vida universal, la ascen- si6n perpetua de Psique."6 Shortly after composing "Coloquio de los centauros," Dario wrote a series of thirteen poems en- titled "Las ainforas de Epicuro," which he added to the 1901 edition of Prosas pro- fanas. Four of the thirteen deal with occult themes; two-"La espiga" and "Ama tu ritmo ..."-center on the Pythagorean concept of the unity of all life. If, as suggested by Marasso, "La espi- ga" (p. 615), the first of the series, was produced under the influence of Verlaine's "C'est la f&amp;te du bl . . .,"7 Dario chose to intensify the pantheistic view expressed in the French poem. The elements of nature are described in such a way that, from the outset, it is clear that the poet's concern is not with external appearances but with the hidden realities that they represent. The key word is signo, for all of nature is seen as a sign of the unity of life in and through God. 691</page><page sequence="2">692 Cathy L. Jrade Hispania 63 (Dec. 1980) Mira el signo sutil que los dedos del viento hacen al agitar el tallo que se inclina y se alza en una ritmica virtud de movimiento. Con el dureo pincel de la flor de la harina trazan sobre la tela azul del firmamento el misterio inmortal de la tierra divina y el alma de las cosas que da su sacramento en una interminable frescura matutina. Pues en la paz del campo la faz de Dios asoma. De las floridas urnas mistico incienso aroma el vasto altar en donde triunfa la azul sonrisa. Aun verde esti y cubierto de flores el madero, bajo sus ramas Ilenas de amor pace el cordero y en la espiga de oro y luz duerme la misa. "La espiga" is a sonnet in alexandrines, a form preferred by the Parnassians for its symmetry (fourteen fourteen-syllable lines).8 Dario exploits the flexibility given to the fourteen-syllable line by the Modern- ists by combining trochaic, ternary, and French alexandrines to modulate the rhythm in accordance with the conceptual substance.' For example, in the first three lines Dario presents the scene out of which the underlying concepts of the poem de- velop. A sign is seen in the movement of a plant which is being stirred by the "fin- gers of the wind." These three lines run on unbrokenly in a steady yet gentle "move- ment"-the word is emphasized by its final position in the third line-that conveys the rhythmic swaying of the wheat in the wind. The use of synecdoche points to the presence and anticipates the appearance of an anthropomorphic force that governs the universe. The sign made is subtle, noticed only by the enlightened poet, who now di- rects the reader's attention to it. The movement of the plant, in which the sign is seen, is described in "se inclina y se alza," as if the blade were praying or be- stowing a blessing. This phrase brings out a secondary meaning of the word signo--a sign that is made as a benediction, like that made during the Mass-and clearly sets the poem in a religious framework. The religious tone is reinforced by the words virtud and ritmica, which evoke the concept of moral law and, more specif- ically, the Pythagorean injunction that man should set his soul in order by under- standing and imitating the orderliness seen in nature, since both man and the universe are aspects of the harmonious unfolding of God. This conception of the cosmos forms the basis of the next five lines, which in- terpret the initial scene poetically and phil- osophically through a series of metaphors. The poet envisions the swaying stem as a golden brush with which the fingers of the wind paint upon the blue canvas of the sky. They sketch "el misterio inmortal de la tierra divina/ y el alma de las cosas." In other words, it is in all the elements of nature working together in cosmic har- mony (one as the painter, one as the paint brush, and one as the canvas) that the eternal mystery of the divine and the soul- the single soul-of all things become evi- dent. And, in the tradition that links the spirit with the wind, it is the morning fresh- ness that is the sign of God's internal and spiritual effect (el sacramento) offered by the universal soul.'" The uninterrupted flow of lines four through eight serves to reinforce both the soothing and the unend- ing qualities of the morning breeze, and the tinkle of the t's in "matutina" further enhances the reader's perception of the re- freshing morning air. Dario thus creates a scene of paradisiacal harmony and bliss in which time has been suspended. Though the term sacramento is used in this non- Catholic context, Dario draws upon its as- sociation with the sacramento del altar. He strengthens the allusion to the Eucharist by describing the indefinite "tallo" of the second line as "el diureo pincel de la flor de la harina." Because the plant/brush is golden, it is linked to the sun, God, and fruitfulness;"'' because it is "la flor de la harina," it is associated with the special flour into which it will be milled to make the host. The end-stopped ninth line, "Pues en la paz del campo la faz de Dios asoma," stands apart as the turning point of the poem. It summarizes the concepts present in the two quatrains and introduces the concluding section of the sonnet. The "paz del campo" underscores the fact that all the elements of nature are working in har- mony. The universal force, whose fingers moved the initial ear of wheat, now shows its "face" and is readily identified as God. In lines ten and eleven the countryside, where God becomes visible, is metaphori- cally converted into a temple and its ele- ments into religious objects. Flowers be- come "floridas urnas" and their scent be- comes a "mistico incienso" which per- fumes "el vasto altar" where God tri- umphs. Thus the implied religiosity of the</page><page sequence="3">Rub6n Dario and the Oneness of the Universe 693 quatrains becomes explicit. The God that triumphs is blue-a color identified with heaven, heavenly love, and truth-, because He is the divine mystery that can be seen on the "tela azul del firmamento."'2 He is a "smile" for two fundamental reasons. After examining the harmonious workings of nature, Dario senses that the divine force governing the universe is friendly, benevolent, and bene- ficent. The smiling, happy God of the countryside is therefore implicitly opposed to the angry, punishing God of the Old Testament or the suffering Catholic Christ. In addition, Dario projects his own happi- ness upon being able to perceive a divine force. For him it is a wish come true, a wish that he clearly expresses later in "Helios" (p. 644): "Que sientan las naciones/ el volar de tu carro." Throughout the quatrains and the first tercet, Dario presents a world view that is congruent with the Pythagorean cos- mology he learned from the occult reli- gions. In the second tercet, he focuses upon a different aspect of the occult tradition, i.e., its belief in the fundamental unity of all religions. With the introduction of stan- dard Christian symbolism, he clarifies his previous allusions to the Eucharist and makes evident his reconciliation of Catho- lic doctrine with his pantheistic vision. He focuses on a different element in the countryside described: a tree trunk still green and covered with flowers. The plac- ing in final position and the consequent linking of the words madero, cordero, and misa remove all doubt that the madero is the Cross of Redemption. That the trunk is still alive means that it has not yet served its ultimate purpose. That beneath it "pace el cordero" indicates that Christ has not yet been sacrificed. The branches of the three are "filled with love," because the scene described is of the time before man's fall. To complete this idyllic vision, Dario returns to the "dureo pincel de la flor de la harina," which is now "la espiga de oro y luz." The ideas previously associated with the color gold are reinforced by the word luz. Clearly, the ear of wheat is made of the golden light of the sun, which Dario, under the influence of the occult religions, associates with the Supreme Deity."3 By stressing the presence of the divine within the espiga, he emphasizes the pantheism of the poem and the dispersion of God throughout nature. At the same time, he affirms the Catholic belief that God is in the host. Dario achieves a reconciliation of Catholic and occult doctrine by holding that "en la espiga . . . duerme la misa." In other words, even in this paradisiacal, pre-Christian, prelapsarian setting, God is in the wheat. But, since there is as yet no need for the mass, it will lie dormant within the ear of wheat until Christ is sacrificed. As "La espiga" unfolds, Dario builds upon the elements present in the initial scene, preparing the way for the final, syncretic image which reconciles Pytha- gorean pantheism and Catholic doctrine. The elements gradually become more and more invested with supernatural and re- ligious significance. In contrast to this deepening religious experience of "La espiga," in the fifth sonnet of "Las ain- foras de Epicuro," "Ama tu ritmo .. ." (p. 617), Pythagorean pantheism is seen through a cool, calculating, mathematical eye. Not that religion and mathematics represented to Pythagoras opposing points of view. Rather they were two inseparable factors in a single world view.14 The cen- tral notions which held these two elements together were those of contemplation, or- derliness, and purification. By contemplat- ing the order revealed in the universe, espe- cially in mathematics, music, and the regular movement of the heavenly bodies, and by assimilating himself to that orderli- ness, man is progressively purified until he eventually escapes from the cycle of birth and attains immortality.'" Pythagoras derived the fundamental doctrines of his philosophy from observing the mathematical ratio that exists between the lengths of string required to produce different notes at a particular tension. Indeed, the key Pythagorean view that the real and comprehensible nature of things was to be found in proportion and number came to him largely from these observa- tions, which formed the basis of both the belief in universal harmony and the image of celestial music. Many times these vari- ous ideas became fused into a simplified conception of Pythagoreanism as holding that the universe is regulated by rhythm.'6 In "Ama tu ritmo . .," one senses,</page><page sequence="4">694 Cathy L. Jrade Hispania 63 (Dec. 1980) through the poet's use of self-directed com- mands and the shorter, eleven-syllable lines, the imperative quality of both his desire to attune himself to the all-pervading pulse of the universe and of the universal beat itself. No longer, as in "La espiga," is the setting idyllic nor the unity of life immediately evident, rather the poet must strive to perceive and to achieve harmony. Thus the lyricism of the previous poem gives way to a crisp, assertive tone; its long, flowing lines to short, abrupt phrases; and its pastoral scene to arithme- tic and geometric signs and symbols. The poet tells himself: "Ama tu ritmo y ritma tus acciones/ bajo su ley, asi como tus versos." He feels an obligation to obey the rhythm of the universe-seen here as divine law-, because he has singled him- self out as the most capable of integrating himself into this rhythm thereby achieving harmony in his life and in his poetry. Pythagoreans hold that from the mo- ment that God is manifest He is simul- taneously indivisible essence and divisible substance. They also hold that the physical manifestations of God, both man and the universe, are made in His image. This tra- ditional solution to the problem of the One and the Many is elaborated and re- worked in lines three through eight of "Ama tu ritmo . ." eres un universo de universos, y tu alma una fuente de canciones. La celeste unidad que presupones, hard brotar en ti mundos diversos; y al resonar tus niimeros dispersos pitagoriza en tus constelaciones. The poet is told that he is a universe of universes, for he is a microcosm which ideally should be a perfect reproduction of that harmonious macrocosm." His soul is a source of songs, for the enlightened poet distills and transforms into poetry the music of the spheres that reverberates within him. Yet clearly the poet's accord with the universe does not stop there. As Dario contemplates the divine unity, he assimilates its productive qualities and becomes the origin of new life and diverse worlds. Since these diverse worlds of art and beauty are patterned on universal harmony, their fundamental nature is pro- portion and number. Hence, at the same time that the celestial unity is harmonious- ly reflected within the constellations of Dario's poetic worlds, the reading of Dario's poetry causes his "nuimeros dis- persos" to reecho within the universe. In this way, Dario establishes within the quat- rains a series of parallel mirrors in which the harmonious universe is reflected in man and his works while man's image and views of the universe are reflected back. Dario communicates acoustically the sensa- tion of echo through the purposeful use of repetition throughout the poem. The word versos reappears in "universo de universos" and in "diversos," "divina" reappears in "adivina," and "urna" in "nocturna" and "taciturna." In addition, dispersos echoes diversos in the second quatrain. After the normal pause, the sonnet "re- sumes" with a series of commands that continue the injunction of the first line and maintain the imperative tone of the poem. Escucha la ret6rica divina del pajaro del aire y la nocturna irradiaci6n geom6trica adivina; mata la indiferencia taciturna, y engarza perla y perla cristalina en donde la verdad vuelca su urna. Once again the poet is told to attune him- self to universal harmony: to listen to the enlightened song of the bird and to solve the riddle of the geometric movement of the stars.'" The chiasmus of the first tercet and the greater fluidity of these lines suggest that Dario senses that he is approxi- mating his goal. The commands remain as a warning that he always be vigilant. For this reason the poem concludes with an appeal that the poet eliminate silent in- difference and neglect and that he string together "perla y perla cristalinal en donde la verdad vuelca su urna." The final imagery is more fully understood in light of another of Dario's poems, "Lirica," written in 1902. Todavia esta Apolo triunfante, todavia gira bajo su lumbre la rueda del destino y viertense del carro en el diurno camino las inforas de fuego, las urnas de armonia. (p. 765) As the later poem clearly indicates, Dario envisions the sun as a giant urn of truth and harmony. In "Ama tu ritmo ...," the poet is told to string together his crys- talline creations which, like the pearls of a necklace, catch and reflect the light of</page><page sequence="5">Ruben Dario and the Oneness of the Universe 695 the sun.'9 The ultimate mission of the en- lightened poet is, as implied in the quat- rains, to produce works that mirror the truth and harmony that he perceives around him. Approximately seven years later, in April of 1908, Dario wrote another sonnet, "En las constelaciones" (p. 1035), which bears a strong resemblance to "Ama tu ritmo .. ." but which reflects a fundamen- tal change in attitude. The undefined "nocturna irradiaci6n geom6trica" reap- pears as "constelaciones pitag6ricas" and the repetition, with minor variations, of the words constelaciones, Pitdgoras, and leia recalls the repetition within the first line of "Ama tu ritmo . . ." More impor- tantly, the poet's concern with following the rhythm of the universe is the same in both sonnets. But the differences are cru- cial. In the earlier of the two, one senses the poet's recently awakened awareness of the universal law of harmony and a naive confidence in his ability to follow his own commands. In the later poem, he seeks to explain-or to justify-his often unsuccessful attempts to do so. He no longer tells himself what to do; the tt' of the earlier poem is now a yo and the im- peratives are now indicatives. The poet states: En las constelaciones Pitigoras leia, yo en las constelaciones pitag6ricas leo; pero se han confundido dentro del alma mia el alma de Pitigoras con el alma de Orfeo. The "but" of line three marks the intro- duction of the poet's explanation of his loss of harmony-both with nature and within himself. The use of the adjective pitag6ricas to describe the constellations emphasizes this loss. When Dario tries to read harmony in the stars, he loses touch with them; they become Pythagorean and alien. "En las constelaciones" relates the poet's internal struggle and his attempt to overcome the chaos within his soul by re- establishing contact with the order inherent in nature, an order that he seeks to re- create in his poetry. As Erika Lorenz points out, it certainly is not surprising that Pythagoras and Or- pheus should become confused in Dario's syncretic imagination, for both serve a dual, musical-religious function. Pytha- goras, who is, of course, closely associated with the "music of the spheres," also sym- bolizes the "rhythm of all that exists." Thus, the Pythagorean law which demon- strates the unity of all life in number in proportion is linked with Orpheus' magic song, which fuses all that exists in a unity of feeling.20 Dario does not deny that great beauty can be created under the aegis of feeling. He does find, however, that in his life feel- ings often turn into wild impulses which interfere with the pursuit of harmony. To illustrate this point, the two facets of Dario's soul to which he alludes in the first quatrain are delineated in the second as opposing forces of dissonance and consonance and as the result of two antithetical incarnations. S6 que soy, desde el tiempo del Paraiso, reo; se que he robado el fuego y robe la armonia; que es abismo mi alma y huracdn mi deseo; que sorbo el infinito y quiero todavia ... On the one hand, Dario feels that his per- manent, reincarnating soul has been sinful since the beginning of time. On the other, he believes that he is aspiring and benevo- lent, having been, in a former life, Pro- metheus or very much like him. This split in Dario's character is emphasized by the repetition of the initial se' in lines five and six and by the parallels established in lines seven and eight. The abismo that is his soul is contrasted with the infinito that he is able to absorb thereby attaining com- munion with the soul of the world, and his wildly uncontrollable and destructive desire is contrasted with his open-ended aspiration.2' The anguish caused by the struggle with- in his soul is clear in the choppy, almost disjointed, structure of the first tercet, and his confusion is apparent in the use of the extended rhetorical question that begins with "i~qu6 voy a hacer. . .?" The funda- mental problem, as Dario sees it, is that he cannot satisfy both aspects of his being simultaneously, and he therefore always wishes to be different from what he is. The path toward reconciliation and har- mony is indicated in the second tercet by the "tortuga de oro," which shows the poet God's will. En la arena me ensefia la tortuga de oro hacia d6nde conduce de las musas el coro y en d6nde triunfa, augusta, la voluntad de Dios. As previously indicated, Dario learned from the occult religions that because the</page><page sequence="6">696 Cathy L. Jrade Hispania 63 (Dec. 1980) entire universe is the visible unfolding of God in space and time, there is life every- where, even in what is generally regarded as dead and inert matter. It is most often the enlightened poet who can interpret the external signs that indicate deeper mean- ings and internal life. Consequently, it is not unusual that the tortoise should lead Dario to the choir of the Muses or show him where God's will triumphs.22 Similar- ly, in an earlier sonnet, "La tortuga de oro . . ." (p. 1004), written in 1900, it is the tortoise-through the signs that it traces on the carpet, the enigma that is engraved on its carapace, and the circle that is drawn in its shadow-that identi- fies the God that usually remains unnamed and unrecognized. In both poems, Dario concludes with a reference to the under- lying music of reality and, by extension, to the universal harmony to which he seeks to attune himself in spite of his "pecho suave" and his "pensamiento parco."'23 "La tortuga de oro .. ." also shows the close linking of God's will with the con- cept of the eternal return, an association which is only alluded to in "En las cons- telaciones" in the reference to rein- carnation.24 God's will is seen not in the ploddings of a tortoise across the sand but in the sweep of the birds across the sky in "P;ijaros de las islas" (p. 1016), written on the island of Mallorca during the winter of 1906. Pajaros de las islas: en vuestra concurrencia hay una voluntad, hay un arte secreto y una divina ciencia, gracia de eternidad. Here again the elements of nature reveal "la ('nica Verdad," that is, the oneness of the universe in and through God, and once again Dario aspires to learn the divine wisdom captured in their flight in order to establish in his poetry and his soul the idyllic harmony unseen by most men. Dario finds in the graceful movement of the birds a sign or cifra of a perfectly ordered and proportionate universe. He also responds to their flight aesthetically, by proclaiming it a work of art. Although ordinarily these two points of view are considered incompatible-one based on a mathematical or scientific grasp of the universe, the other on an intuitive reac- tion to it-, Dario, following in the tradi- tion of the French Romantics and Sym- bolists, is able to reconcile these two approaches to nature. Harmony, which within the Pythagorean-and occult- conception of the universe is based on number and proportion, is for Dario an artistic standard associated with divine perfection, the Good, and the Beautiful. Nature is the supreme work of art, in which the divinely gifted and inspired poet recog- nizes the perfect proportions of universal harmony.25 By drawing upon the harmony behind the disorganized appearance of ex- ternal realities, the poet is able to capture the essence of the supernatural in his art. In this way, the complementary pairs estab- lished in stanzas one, two, and five-arte / ciencia, academia / signos, dicha de mis ojos / problemas de mi meditaci6n-deal with a single truth about the birds. Dario's desire to imitate their flight and thereby capture in his poetry the secret art and divine wisdom that they embody becomes clear in the final stanza. Artis- tically he has achieved this objective throughout the poem. The alternating glide and flapping of the birds' wings is cap- tured by the alternation between fourteen- and seven-syllable lines, and the oxytone rhyme in the shorter lines, all but one of which are end-stopped, contributes to a feeling of calm and order. At the same time it is evident that the attainment of harmony is more than an artistic goal. It is a means of achieving inner peace, accord with all life, and, in turn, immortality through reunion with the single soul of the universe. For this rea- son, in addition to "una voluntad," "un arte secreto," and "una divina ciencia," Dario sees "gracia de eternidad" in their sweep across the heavens. He more closely joins the image of the birds with the concept of immortality by drawing upon traditional symbolism which links the soul with winged creatures. In the last stan- za, Dario represents his soul as a bird that aspires to fly in unison with the others that had previously been described as "almas dulces y herm~ticas." As his soul is meta- phorically converted into a bird, the birds are metaphorically changed into souls that have, for ages, flown in harmony with nature: "a vuestras alas liricas son las brisas de Ulises,/ los vientos de Jas6n." It is in this way that Dario underscores</page><page sequence="7">Rub6n Dario and the Oneness of the Universe 697 the evolutionary aspect of "la Uinica Ver- dad," namely, the doctrine of transmigra- tion of souls, at the same time that he relates his sense of elation as his soul takes flight "con las alas puras de mi deseo abiertas/ hacia la inmensidad." The fusion of the diachronic and syn- chronic aspects of the oneness of the universe is evident in "Filosofia" (p. 664), published in Cantos de vida y esperanza (1905) not long before the composition of "Pajaros de las islas." The first of the two four-line stanzas is directed to the lower creatures of the world who are in- formed that, because of the kinship of all life and the resulting laws of reincarnation, they can expect to advance on the scale of existence and even, perhaps, attain reunion with God. For this reason, they should be grateful that they are alive. The tone of optimism and exaltation is established by the initial phrases of lines one and two: "Saluda al sol, arafia, no seas rencorosa. / Da tus gracias a Dios, oh sapo, pues que eres." The spider and the toad are to turn skyward and to speak to the sun and to God respectively. Yet, because the har- monious unity of life has a punitive aspect, Dario reminds these creatures that they can descend as easily as ascend on the scale of existence. The prickly crab is linked to the rose by its thorns, and mollusks have reminiscences of women. The graphic connection between women and mollusks appears to indicate that it is the sexual facet of women that has caused their return to a lower form of life. In the second stanza, Dario once again turns to the discussion of the signs of nature and introduces the concept of "norms," which are probably demiurgic emanations of divine thought.26 Sabed ser lo que sois, enigmas, siendo formas; dejad la responsabilidad a las Normas, que a su vez la enviar~an al Todopoderoso . . . (Toca, grillo, a la luz de la luna, y dance el oso.) The demiurge acts on behalf of the Su- preme Being by putting into "formas" God's concept of the world, "el enigma." Neither the forms nor the norms, which are merely divine agents, have responsi- bility, for all is passed on to the All-power- ful. The final, fantastical commands un- derscore the poet's belief that it is by becoming attuned to the rhythm of life and the music of the spheres that universal harmony can be achieved. Most of the "signs" of the oneness of life examined so far come from the land. But, in "Marina" (p. 670), "Caracol" (p. 679), "Revelaci6n" (p. 712), the uni- versal life force is seen in the rhythmic movement of the sea and the beating of its great heart, both of which serve as models for the poet's art and soul. De- tailed studies of these three poems are pre- sented by Alan S. Trueblood in his article, "Ruben Dario: The Sea and the Jungle." In tracing the development of the symbol of the sea from "Sinfonia en gris mayor" (probably from 1889) and "Tarde del tr6pico" (1892) to "Marina," "Caracol" (both from 1903) and "Revelaci6n" (1907), he discovers that "behind the vari- ous marine rhythms which Dario carried into the beat of his lines, behind the sea- sounds he transposed into verbal music, lay in addition all the sense of a single limitless life which the sea more than any other force in nature arouses."27 Thus it is in all the elements of nature-on land, on sea, and in the sky-that Dario perceives the single soul of the universe. W HILE THE "ONENESS OF THE UNIVERSE" is not a magic formula for the appre- ciation of Dario's poetry, the cosmology that it stands for underlies a significant sector of his work and forms an integral part of his poetic vision. By penetrating the apparent chaos and disorder of the world, Dario seeks not only to affirm the unity of all life but also to pattern himself and his poetry on the harmony he finds in nature. Even in those cases in which he doubts his own abilities, he brings together, through the creative use of images, acous- tical patterns, verbal effects, and figures of speech, the conceptual and the experi- ential aspects of the poems. He thereby embodies in his poetry the main tenets of Pythagorean pantheism. NOTES 'At the height of his carrer, Dario can recall from his childhood that he often withdrew from merriment and went all by himself to look at things in the sky and sea because of his sad and pensive nature. He adds: "Debo decir que desde niflo se me infundi6 una gran religiosidad que Ilegaba a veces hasta la superstici6n" (Ruben Dario, Autobiograffia, Obras completas, I [Madrid: Afrodisio Aguado, 1950], 28-29). Examples of his early impressions of</page><page sequence="8">698 Cathy L. Jrade Hispania 63 (Dec. 1980) nature can be found in "Al mar," probably written in 1879, and "Desengaflo," written in 1880 (Ruben Dario, Poesias completas, ed. Alfonso Mendez Plan- carte [Madrid: Aguilar, 1968], pp. 248-49, 7). Quotations in the text are from this edition. 2While in El Salvador from 1882 to 1883, Dario came to know Hugo's poetry well under the tutelage of Francisco Gavidia and undoubtedly was exposed to Hugo's pantheistic and gnostic beliefs-many of which stemmed from his readings of the occult tradi- tion (Enrique Anderson Imbert, La originalidad de Ruben Dario [Buenos Aires: Centro Editor de America Latina, 1967], pp. 21, 24-25). By 1888, when he wrote "Catulle Mendis: Parnasianos y decadentes," Dario already had a sound understand- ing of Symbolist aesthetics. 3After the fundamental studies of Enrique Ander- son Imbert (La originalidad de Ruben Dario) and Octavio Paz ("El caracol y la sirena," Cuadrivio [Mexico: Joaquin Mortiz, 1965], pp. 9-65) as well as lesser known studies, there can be no question that Dario was greatly influenced by the occult from the time of his first encounter with it shortly after his return to Central America in 1889. 4Pythagoras and Pythagoreanism are thus con- sidered in Edouard Schure's esoteric classic The Great Initiates: A Study of the Secret History of Religions, one of but a few books that Arturo Marasso mentions as having a lasting influence on Dario's imagination and poetic thought (Ruben Dario y su creaci6n podtica [Buenos Aires: Biblioteca Nueva, 1946], pp. 12-13).

'oThat the wind is often linked with life by virtue of its connection with breath or exhalation is demon- strated by Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and Latin in which the word for wind also means "breath" and "spirit." "''Clara Erskine Clement, A Handbook of Christian Symbols and Stories of the Saints (Boston: Ticknor, 1889), p. 9. "Ibid., p. 9. "The occult religions preach that the image of the Sun-god was carried into Christianity by those who chronicled the life and acts of Jesus. They point out that after the spring equinox, that is, the crossing over or crucifixion, the Sun-god rises triumphantly and ascends into heaven and ripens the corn and grape, giving his very life to them to make their sub- stance and through them to his worshippers (Annie Besant, Esoteric Christianity [Adyar, Madras: Theo- sophical Publishing House, 1957]. pp. 109-10).

'6Ricardo Gull6n points out that Modernists held this belief to be central to both Pythagoreanism and their own poetic creation ("Pitagorismo y modernis- mo," Mundo nuevo, no. 7 [enero 1967], p. 23). "Francisco Rico in El pequeho mundo del hombre sees this point as the core of the poem's meaning and calls "Ama tu ritmo ..." "una declaraci6n de la microcosmia humana, en los t&amp;rminos familiares de la estirpe pitag6rica" ([Madrid: Editorial Cas- talia, 1970], p. 287). '"Although Marasso suggests that the "irradiaci6n geometrica" is the rays given off by or the illumina- tion from the divine idea, the universal monad (p. 162), it seems more likely that, with the use of the adjective "nocturna," Dario was referring to the night sky. However, the two views are easily recon- ciled. One need only recall that the universe is created in God's image and that the harmony seen there is patterned on the harmony inherent in God. 'Cf. Dario use of this image in two of his earlier "Rimas" (pp. 501, 507). 20Ruben Dario: "bajo en divino imperio de la mtisica" (Managua: Ediciones "Lengua," 1960), pp. 31-32. "In "Revelaci6n" (lines 7-9) we read: "Y senti que sorbia en sal y viento / como una comuni6n de comuniones/ que en mi heria sentido y pensamiento" (p. 712). 22The tortuga is not merely, as suggested by Erika Lorenz, the symbol of the lyre, the body of which was originally a tortoise's shell. 23Raymond Skryme in his Ruben Dario and the Pythagorean Tradition, Latin American Mono- graphs-Second Series, No. 15 (Gainesville: The University Presses of Florida, 1975) presents a de- tailed study of "La tortuga de oro . . ." as a key example of the fusion of the principles of mystery and music in Dario's conception of "la concorde unidad del universo" (pp. 33-43). 24Octavio Paz explains: "La obra divina es la revoluci6n ciclica que pone arriba lo que estaba abajo y obliga a cada cosa a transformarse en su contrario: inmola al Minotauro y petrifica a la Medusa" (p. 61). 25In "La espiga," as we saw above, the ear of wheat is seen as a golden brush with which the fingers of the wind paint upon the blue canvas of the sky. 26Marasso, p. 245. 27"Ruben Dario: The Sea and the Jungle," Com- parative Literature Studies, IV, no. 4 (1967), 443. CHAPTER MEMBERS Urge your chapter officers to schedule meetings of interest to teachers of both Spanish and Portuguese. The Portuguese content doesn't have to be the entire meeting, but we are doing the Association's long-range mission a disservice if we do not take every oppor- tunity to advance both of our languages!</page></plain_text>
