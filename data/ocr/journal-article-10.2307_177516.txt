<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS There are minor mistakes scattered throughout the text. For example, Isenberg misuses scientific names in several places, sometimes failing to capitalize generic names, once or twice using wrong specific names, and at least once failing to ital- icize a scientific name. We noted one particularly naive and anthropomorphic statement: "Northern herds assembled for the rut later than those to the south, perhaps to ensure that calves would not arrive until late in the succeeding spring ...." Additionally, we found the method used to cite published literature to be especially onerous. Citations are listed as footnotes only; there is no section in which all the cited references are listed. This makes it difficult or impos- sible for a reader to quickly scan the cited papers of a par- ticular author. Finally, there are a few misspellings, and it would have been helpful for non-historians if the author had included more maps showing the locations of forts, posts, and other places mentioned in text. According to the author, the text of The destruction of the bison originated as a series of individual papers published in scholarly journals. As might be expected, the book therefore suffers from disjointed organization and contains unnecessary repetition. For example, Isenberg discusses the relatively short roots of native grasses in dry areas of the High Plains on page 18 and again on page 141. A biologist or student who wishes to compile dates, numbers, and other information from the book thus will find it difficult to do so. However, the persistent re- searcher will be rewarded for his or her efforts. Conservation biologists and ecologists concerned with ex- tinction, its causes, and its prevention, will find this history book informative, enlightening, scholarly, and thorough. To avoid repeating history, we must strive to understand it. JERRY R. CHOATE EUGENE D.

Some people may remember the television special in the 1960s that proclaimed, "Who Killed Lake Erie" and stim- ulated the environmental movement. Some people still be- lieve that Lake Erie is dead. Good news! Lake Erie has been revived-not from death but from a critical illness. In fact, researchers say that Lake Erie now is experiencing oligotro- phication and some think that nutrient loading was reduced too much or at least too quickly. Lake Erie is one of the best documented cases of human abuses of an ecosystem, ecosystem changes, and restoration. Its case history is important because it shows that humans can drastically alter huge ecosystems and that the same things that happened to Lake Erie are happening to an enormous number of lakes. We should be able to learn from Lake Erie and be encouraged that humans can reverse the degradation. A difficult problem for people interested in Lake Erie is that scientific information is scattered in scientific journals and buried in agency reports. The first effort to concentrate man- uscripts on physical, chemical, and biological aspects of Lake Erie occurred in 1976 in the Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada (volume 33). This issue documented the eutrophication and drastic changes in species composition of Lake Erie. Unfortunately, no one has compiled a collection of scientific papers that document the changes and processes that have occurred in Lake Erie after the nutrient reduction program until now. If you would like to quickly learn about the changes in Lake Erie over the past two decades, consult a book called State of Lake Erie: past, present and future. The book is a collection of manuscripts from a symposium at the 39th In- ternational Association for Great Lakes Research conference in 1996. Although laypersons may find some valuable infor- mation, the manuscripts are technical and scholarly works. The symposium was dedicated to two renown Lake Erie sci- entists, Joseph Leach and Henry Regier, who were retiring. Dr. Leach wrote the first chapter and presented a historical overview of the major changes in Lake Erie, the key research programs and researchers, and important policies. This paper set the stage well for more in-depth papers. Dr. J. J. Kay and Dr. Regier wrote the last paper. They summarized the changes in Lake Erie by a "two-phase attractor" model that suggests that an aquatic ecosystem may alternate between dominance by the benthic and pelagic regimes. This paper is thought- provoking and should stimulate future research. The papers in the book are grouped into four sections: the changing ecosystem, invasion of exotics, contaminants, and emerging approaches and techniques. There are twelve papers in the first section and the papers intensively cover changes in the major components of the Lake Erie ecosystem. This section contains an excellent collection of papers on changes in sediments, water quality, invertebrates, phytoplankton, and fish. The second section contains five papers. The first paper by Hugh MacIsaac is a survey of biological invasions in Lake Erie. I recommend this paper to anyone interested in invasive species. It is a thorough review of the origins, modes of invasion, and significance of invasive species in Lake Erie. Furthermore, he discusses 31 species that are likely future invaders of Lake Erie and their likely modes of invasion. The December 2000 355 1</page><page sequence="2">Ecology, Vol. 81, No. 12 other four papers in the section cover the effects of zebra and quagga mussels on nutrient concentrations, food webs, fish species, and colonial fish-eating birds. The third section only contains two papers on contaminants. One paper is on organic contaminants in the food web of western Lake Erie and the other is on contaminants in herring gull eggs. The paucity of information on contaminants may disappoint many people; however, contaminants have not been a major problem in the open waters of Lake Erie, perhaps because of the short res- idence time of the water, contaminants binding to suspended sediments, and high biomass. The last section contains six papers. They do not really describe emerging approaches and techniques but simply the use of some different methods; furthermore, they do not fit conveniently into the other sec- tions. The book is constructed well. Because the papers were peer-reviewed and edited by a committee, the quality of the writing and content of the papers are good. The format for each paper is consistent. The book is bound well and the paper is high quality glossy paper. The figures are sharp; however, many figures and tables are too complex and contain too much data. The symposium documents the recent changes in Lake Erie well. Someone who is not familiar with Lake Erie may be frustrated because the information is not always condensed into simple lake-wide patterns and many papers deal with only specific regions. This is because Lake Erie has three basins that each function differently and are in different states of eutrophication or oligotrophication. In addition, the off- shore and nearshore waters function differently. Another complicating factor is that researchers have different expla- nations for the changes in Lake Erie. However, I think it is a strength that the book contains alternative viewpoints. Re- searchers differ on whether the changes in Lake Erie during the last 20 yr were primarily caused by nutrient reduction, dreissenid mussels, or the population explosion of a keystone predator, the walleye. Some researchers suggest that nutrient reduction has been too fast and great; thus, large fluctuations have been caused in some components of the ecosystem. Be- cause dreissenid species have increased so greatly and con- spicuously in Lake Erie, it is tempting to ascribe many chang- es in the lake to them. A strength of the symposium is that it includes some papers that find no effect of dreissenid spe- cies on chemical or biological components in their region. An unusual hypothesis is that the conservative quota man- agement of the walleye led to a population explosion and many changes in the food web. The symposium covers "present" changes in the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of Lake Erie well. Someone who is not familiar with Lake Erie might prefer more infor- mation on the "past" changes during the eutrophication stage. Some authors present good historical changes for their topic and others do not. I am disappointed that the symposium did not discuss the human dimension much. After all, humans have caused most of the problems and humans must solve the problems. People who are not actively involved in re- search and management on Lake Erie need more information on the regulations, policies, agreements, and legislation that led to the nutrient reduction and changes in water quality. Futhermore, I would like more discussion on the "future" of Lake Erie. I would like to know what we need to do to manage or protect the lake in the future with respect to policy and research agendas. A closing chapter in which someone spec- ulated on future changes, problems, needs, and approaches would have been a valuable ending. I definitely recommend this book to scientists who are in- terested in Lake Erie or the Great Lakes. The papers are good, current, and detailed. People who are working on other aquat- ic ecosystems can gain a better understanding of the com- plexity, interactions, and changes that occur in aquatic eco- systems by reading this book. The book should be purchased by most university and research libraries. JIMMY D.

The redwood forest: history, ecology, and conservation of the coast redwoods. Island Press, Washington, D.C. xxvii + 339 p. $60.00 (cloth), ISBN: 1-55963-725-0 (acid-free paper); $30.00 (paper), ISBN: 1- 55963-726-9 (acid-free paper). We live in a world that is both ancient and thoroughly modern. Nowhere is this more evident than in the remaining stands of redwood forest scattered along western North Amer- ica. Here, in the cool, wet climates of the Pacific West, we find some of the largest and oldest trees on the planet, Sequoia sempervirens. Redwoods now represent "living fossils" with a family lineage over 250 million years old, yet the coastal redwood plant community is perhaps only 4000 yr old with unremarkable diversity and few if any neoendemics. The Tax- odiaceae reached their acme in the Cretaceous but the red- wood's slow ebb vastly accelerated after Europeans found their way to the west coast. More than 95% of these mag- nificent forests have now been logged, epitomizing our world- wide hemorrhage of habitats. And while individual redwoods commonly live beyond 500 yr (one has been dated to 2200 yr), "natural death" has become rare in managed stands where this valuable timber tree is rarely allowed to mature beyond 100 yr. 3552 BOOK REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
