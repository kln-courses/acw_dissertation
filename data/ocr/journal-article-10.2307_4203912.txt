<plain_text><page sequence="1">MASARYK'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY * WHEN Thomas Garrigue Masaryk, already President of the Republic he had created, published his war memoirs in 1925 under the title World Revolution, he said this: "I stayed more than eighteen months in London-from the end of September, I9I5, to the end of April, I9I7. . . . The University offered me a Slavonic professorship which Seton- Watson pressed on me again and again on behalf of Dr. Burrows, the Principal of King's College; and even though I was reluctant to take it, because I am not a Slavonic specialist " (that from a man who two years before had published the two volumes of Russia and Europe) " and because I feared that I should have no leisure for scientific work, I ended by accepting it, and did well to follow the advice of my friends.. The subject of my inaugural lecture on 19 October, 1915, was The problem of small nations in the European crisis. It was our first big political success. Above all, the fact that the Prime Minister, Mr. Asquith, had agreed to take the chair, accredited me to the wide public in London; and as Mr. Asquith fell ill, Lord Robert Cecil represented him, and thereby provided a political background which gave our cause great prestige." 1 In that record are linked not only the philosophy and creative states- manship which make Masaryk one of the small number of those who have combined 6vvautti noAirtrtxr xat QpftoSoqa, but also the two men whom it is my privilege to succeed in this Chair, Masaryk and Seton-Watson, the father and the midwife of the Czechoslovak Republic. Those of us who are young enough to think of the Austro-Hungarian Empire merely as an historical phenomenon as irreparable as the empire of Attila, sometimes forget that when Seton-Watson first set off on his crusade as " Scotus Viator " forty years ago the Austro-Hungarian state was one of the potent realities of world politics, and that the Czecho- slovaks, the Croats, the Slovenes and the Ruthenes were even to the scholars and statesmen of western Europe but half-remembered names of oppressed and neglected subjects of the Habsburgs. That they are to-day constituent parts of independent and powerful states, strong in their restored pride in their past and their plans for the future, is in large measure due not only to Masaryk, but also to Seton-Watson. Both men are apostles of the Platonic gospel that philosophy which does not ripen into action is but barren scholasticism. Seton-Watson, during the twenty years before 1914, laboured not only to know the peoples of central Europe, but also to make them known, and during the period of * Inaugural Lecture delivered by the Masaryk Professor of Central European History in the University of London, 4 June, 1947. 30</page><page sequence="2">MASARYK'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. 31 the first war he seconded the efforts of Masaryk and Benes, Trumbic and Pasic, with such effect that Balfour's recognition of the Czecho- slovak provisional government and the Pact of Rome which saw the birth of Jugoslavia were in no small measure his work. Since I918 Seton-Watson has watched over the growth and growing pains of his god-children with anxious care; as occupant of this Chair he expounded the history of the Czechoslovaks, the Rumanians, the Magyars and the southern Slavs by voice and pen, and also in three notable volumes he told the story of that British foreign policy which during the last hundred and fifty years has so often been fateful for the central European nations of whom, but for him, not only our prime ministers would have known nothing. And now he has gone if not to a higher, at least to another sphere, to endeavour to stir the University of Oxford out of its omphaloscepsis to have an intelligent and scholarly concern for those Czechs in whom it has shown but little interest since the day in the reign of Henry IV when a group of dissident Oxford scholars purloined the university seal to forge a letter to the Bohemian reformers averring that Wyclif was no heretic. We may hope that Seton-Watson, who wrestled so trium- phantly with the obscurantism of Vienna and Budapest, will succeed even in Oxford. Seton-Watson's achievement as scholar and politician is, I believe, due not only to his own genius and devotion but also to the fact that he is a disciple of Masaryk and has practised the gospel of political philosophy which was Masaryk's most valuable contribution to his own country and to the world. It is the purpose of this lecture to describe the powerful influence which Masaryk exercised on the development of the philosophy of history. That influence was beginning to make itself felt just at the time when Seton-Watson was beginning to shape his life's work. Masaryk himself speaks of "the so-called lucky accident which springs from the inner logic of life and history ",2 and the world must deem it a lucky accident that Masaryk appeared just when he did. His considered judgement of the nature of the historical process was com- pleted in its main features and formulated in an authoritative book during the last decade of the nineteenth century, that is, just at the period which he himself rightly designated one of political, scientific and philosophical crisis.3 The liberal world of the I9th century was already showing signs of dissolution; the golden age of Britain's free trade hegemony was nearing its end; commercial rivalry between Britain, the United States, and Germany was filling the air with threatening storms; the sun of Japan had risen over the horizon in blood-red dawn; the threatened auto- cracies of Austria, Russia, and Turkey were hurrying themselves and their subjects towards war and revolution. Hypertrophied and unregulated capitalist development was driving by its innate momentum towards imperialism and imperialistic conflict.</page><page sequence="3">32 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. In conformity with this catastrophic progress the philosophy of history was finding justification and explanation for the journey towards Armageddon in a philosophy which rejected reason and ethics in favour of scientific fatalism and the amoralism of organic evolution. Two systems, rivals in fact, but sprung from common parents and nurtured in the same environment, were clamouring for men's allegiance. The parent of both was Hegel, who had rationalised reason out of all rationality and set it on the throne of the Hohenzollerns, and who had formulated a dialectical method of thesis, antithesis and synthesis. This method Marx and Engels had used to construct a philosophy of history which was determinist, materialist, objectivist, catastrophic, and revolutionary, one which taught that ethics, religion, ideals, liberty, law, and love were mere ideological superstructures, mere fetishes and illusions. The other school of historical philosophers of the nineties learnt from Hegel to think of the state as omnipotent and omniscient, and had married the fashionable German " Korporationslehre" to immature Darwinism and senile Platonism. Gobineau, Lagarde, Seeley, Treitschke, Bosanquet and Houston Stewart Chamberlain were trying to persuade their generation that every corporation and especially the nation and the state was a living organism, more than and greater than the sum of the individuals that composed it, an organisation with a will, a reason, a soul of its own; an organism in which the function of the individual was no more than that of an unconscious specialised biological cell. Such were the two doctrines, the dialectic of economic materialism and the pseudo-biology of organic totalitarianism, which Masaryk in his early middle age found were being offered as philosophies of history and political panaceas to his students in the University of Prague, and he set himself to examine the validity of their claim to be able to rescue his own nation from the danger of suffocation in the Habsburg hot-house and the world from the danger of war and dissolution. The nature of the case, his own modesty, and his philosophical training made it inevitable that Masaryk's approach to the problem of the nature and direction of the historical process should be critical rather than expository. Therefore in all the many and voluminous writings of Masaryk there is nowhere a. full and systematic account of his own philosophy of history. It has to be culled from a study of his books, articles and lectures, and put together piecemeal from his critical, historical and political works. That he had a positive philosophy of history is apparent to anyone who reads his great treatise on the develop- ment of Russia during the hundred years before I9I3, published in Czech under the title Rusko a Evropa and in English as The Spirit of Russia, or his account of the birth of the Czechoslovak State which he wrote under the title of Svetovd Revoluce, translated into English as The Making of a Nation. Nearly everything which he wrote that I have read throws some light on his historical philosophy, especially</page><page sequence="4">MASARYK'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. 33 The Czech Question (I894), Palacky's Idea of the Czech Nation (I897), The Problem of the Small Nation, (I905), and his inaugural lecture in this University, The Problem of small Nations and the European Crisis (I915). But his greatest book and the one from which above all his detailed philosophy of history must be quarried is The Social Question, published in I898.4 The Social Question was the first systematic critique of Marxism, and still remains a book that every disciple and every opponent of Marxism ought to study most carefully. It was based on an exhaustive knowledge not only of all Marx's writings, but also of those of Engels and the first generation of their followers: Lasalle, Kautsky, Cunow, Konrad Schmidt, Bebel, Liebknecht, Vollmar, Plechanov, Belfort Bax, William Morris, Lafargue, Enrico Ferri, but not of course, those of Lenin, whose import- ance as a philosopher Masaryk did not begin to appreciate until after I9I7. With the rightness or wrongness of Masaryk's criticism of Marxism I am not now concerned. I use The Social Problem merely to elucidate what Masaryk's positive opinions about the historical process were, supplementing it from the incidental light thrown by his other writings, particularly Russia and Europe and World Revolution. Fundamental to an understanding of Masaryk's philosophy of history is the fact that he did not regard history as vitae magistra, laying down laws for all the other arts and sciences. He has nothing but contempt for the " pure " historian of the universities of his day " who masters palaeography and the so-called historical sciences, and then trots out a series of individual facts in accordance with some extraneous system of chronology, but who never learns anything about the substance of society, the state, the church, or anything else." 5 The theory that the answer to all political or social problems is to be sought in history, that all sciences are ultimately history, Masaryk brands as "historism," " which looks for and finds in history reasons for what, in its own opinion, ought to be." 6 " The historian," he says, " must be a specialist. He will be a specialist if, in addition to his auxiliary historical sciences, he is trained in philosophy and sociology; he must also be an historical specialist, for example in political history, which again presupposes a special study of political science." 7 The Marxists, Masaryk felt, chiefly erred in making history supreme over the present and the future. " Rather," he said, " should the historian learn to observe the present in order that he may explain that which is more remote by means of that which is near, the less known from the known." 8 It must be remembered that Masaryk had had no professional historical training; he never professed to be a " pure " historian, in my opinion truly enough, for it seems to me that his historical judgments are not always well founded; he is too ready to take his historical opinions at second hand from the latest doctoral theses, and very rarely had the time or the patience to go to the original texts. I feel that he misjudged and undervalued the Middle Ages and that he was too ready c</page><page sequence="5">34 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. to assume that the Renascence and the Reformation were the cataclysmic beginning of all that has been influential in the making of the world of to-day. It is true that as a young man he had taken steps to set up a society for the publication of the texts of the Czech Reform Movement, and that by his high-minded and unpopular labours in exposing Hanka's forgery of the Zelenohora and Kralove Dvur manuscripts he performed an heroic and enduring service to historical truth, but that does not alter the fact that Masaryk's approach to the philosophy of history was not primarily that of an historian. It was the insistence of Marx and Engels that the past reveals the working of a process of historical dialectic which drove Masaryk to counter their historism with what he calls " realism," by which he meant the study of things as they are, not as they were, or how they came to be what they are. He said: "Over against excessive historism I place realism: first things, afterwards development. And if I have to decide which is the more important I shall say, things. . . . The static, not the dynamic, aspect of the world seems to me to be the chief and especial object of our thinking. Realism, then, stands opposed to Marxism, but not in absolute opposition, for there is no thing which has not developed, and that which develops is things." 9 Masaryk refused to resolve the world and life into the droplets of Heraclitus's river; the world is more than mere movement and mere becoming. " From history I cannot discover what I ought to do, and what I ought to do is what really matters." 10 This scepticism about history is part of Masaryk's indecision about causation and determinism in the historical process; indeed, it is part of his fundamental metaphysical agnosticism. He is constantly charging Marx and Engels with trying to construct a Weltanschauung without first establishing its metaphysical and epistemological basis. But Masaryk is not himself guiltless in this respect; he was sufficiently a child of his time to dislike formal philosophical and theological systems, and indeed once said: " The philosophy of the schools estranged me, for it was a survival and continuation of mediaeval scholasticism. Metaphysics I did not like, for I found no satisfaction therein. In my eyes philosophy was above all ethics, sociology and politics." 11 Therefore we search Masaryk's works in vain for any formal statement of his views about appearance and reality, or about the nature of existence and of truth. This deficiency makes it the more difficult to state precisely his philosophy of history. But there are enough hints and negative statements to compensate for the absence of a formal exposition. Masaryk takes the reality of mind and matter and of the time process for granted. But when he asks himself what is the relationship between events in time he finds himself in a dilemma. He does not want to accept the Marxist ascription of all social phenomena to economic causes, but at the same time he is so much a child of Igth-century science that he accepts the universality of causal connexion, what he calls "the</page><page sequence="6">MASARYK'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. 35 scarlet thread of cause and effect." 12 " The question whether the will is determined or not," he says, " is a matter for empirical psychology, and empiricism proves that it is always determined. Therefore theism, criminal law, and education must recognise this fact." 13 But while Masaryk maintains that everything has a cause he refuses to see cause only in " conditions of production." The essence of his philosophy of historical cause is the doctrine that causes are manifold, complicated, and never simple. He says: " The attempt to give a causal explanation of history is quite justified. But in practice a causal exposition of history demands great caution and methodological care. As a rule an historical event has not one cause, but many, often very many. The individual is constantly being acted on by heaven and earth, by the whole environ- ment, and by the past; causes are closely and mutually connected with each other; results too are not simple but complex; a complex of effects will have a complex of causes, and it is not easy so to isolate individual elements that the connexions of real causes and their working can be discovered with certainty.l4 That needed saying in I898; it needs repeating to-day. But besides the problem of the nature of cause there is the problem of how causality works. Of that Masaryk says: " Beside the multiplicity and complexity of causes we must observe how they work: we must carefully distinguish causes which operate always and without interruption from those which operate only intermittently; those which operate at certain periods from those which operate only once. Also we must measure, or at least estimate, their strength, the intensity of the effect, and we must distinguish those causes which are substantial and therefore deserving of attention from those which are negligible." 15 In the same passage Masaryk warns historians against the temptation to see a causal relationship between every pair of succes- sive and contemporary events. Like causes do not always produce like results; 16 what was or is does not necessarily determine what is or will be."7 For example, vice and misery are not always and solely caused by poverty,18 nor is poverty the only cause of pessimism, which more often afflicts the rich than the poor.19 Masaryk's opinions about historical causation may be illustrated by quoting what he has to say about the causes and effects of the Protestant Reformation: " There can be no doubt that the great reform movement in Bohemia, Germany and everywhere else sprang from religious and moral needs. This is proved by an historical and psychological analysis of the process of the reform. We see how the Reformation changed ways of life and ecclesiastical order. Dogmas changed, the substance of the Church changed, the relations of church and state changed; the whole life of the individual and of society was transformed. It is not true that in the Reformation it was only a matter of conflict between the bour- geoisie and the feudal aristocracy, and that the Reformation was only a ' costume,' a 'change of dress': the religious revolution is the funda- mental and chief part of all those changes which were wrought by and</page><page sequence="7">36 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. with the Reformation. The religious movement was prepared by attempts at reformation made at a time when there was not even a suspicion of the bourgeoisie of Marx and Engels; also the Reformation was established long before the bourgeoisie had developed so far that the new religion could be described merely as its 'costume,' 'reflex,' or anything of that sort." 20 That passage illustrates not only Masaryk's method of historical analysis, but also his imperfect historical equipment. He does not realise how early in the Middle Ages the bourgeoisie begins to be influential, and, like Palacky and most of the Czechoslovak historians, he underestimates the influence of economic factors. It also illustrates the idealism of Masaryk's philosophy of history of which I shall have more to say later. The problem of human freedom and of the place of creative will in the history of man psychologically determined is one with which Masaryk never seriously grappled. He is content to say: " Here we stand before the question of questions. While a brain like that of Kant helped itself out with a wonderful dualism of empirical unfreedom and of the freedom postulated by pure reason, and Marx and Engels saw the answer to the problem of the world and of life in materialistic fatalism, . . . I for myself expound the world and history theistically: theistical determinism is for me a synergism not only social, but also truly metaphysical." 21 How this co-operation of man's free will with the determining providence of God works Masaryk does not explain, except to say that he is a determinist but not a fatalist,22 but again without elucidating the distinc- tion. Determinism he regards as a protestant attitude, indeterminism, with its provision for miracles, as a Catholic attitude.23 That providence plays a part in man's destiny he has no doubt. To it he ascribes those " lucky accidents" which preserved him and Benes during the first world war, and he also quotes: There's a divinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will and adds: " Yet a belief that Providence watches over us and the world is no reason for fatalistic inactivity, but rather for optimistic concentra- tion of effort, for a strict injunction to work determinedly, to work for an idea. Only thus are we entitled to expect the so-called 'lucky accident' that springs from the inner logic of life and history, and to trust in God's help." 24 That, presumably, is " synergism." As on the one hand Masaryk revolted against the strict historical materialism of the Marxists, so on the other he protested against making a fetish of modern science in the fashion of those who saw in history the evolution of cellular organisms. " The cult of science," he said, "by reason of its one-sided positivism has become more than a cult; it is sheer idolatry." 25 And again: "It cannot be disputed that natural science is helpful, indeed necessary, for the philosophical sociologist. But on the other hand, it cannot be too often emphasised that there is a</page><page sequence="8">MASARYK'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. 37 danger of confusing sociology with zoology and natural history. Social and historical laws, the laws of social organisation and development must be established by a strict study of human society and human history themselves; zoology, botany, biology, even cosmology and so forth may give to sociology much instruction and many hints, but that is all. Natural science, at the most, provides sociology with analogies; but it proves absolutely nothing."26 " Society is not an organism, but a collectivum sui generis." 27 " There is no such thing as a collective consciousness; there are only individual consciences." 28 In another place Masaryk says :-" This conception of society as an organism is anthropomorphic in a high degree. It is a mythical habit of thought which Marx and Engels get from Hegel. The organic assumption usually leads sociologists to make the mistake of using analogies with individual organisms for an unwarranted simplification of sociological and political problems. This is the error of all organicists, beginning with Plato, down to Spencer and Marx." 29 Marx had constructed a scientific philosophy of history on the analogy of the physical, mechanical, geological science of Marx's youth; since then the biological sciences had been brought to the forefront by the work of Darwin, Schwann and Wallace. Masaryk is scornful of Engel's attempt to spatchcock evolutionary concepts into the Marxist system. He says: Modern evolutionism, even Darwinism, are irreconcilable with Hegel's teaching; Darwinism cannot be reconciled with Marx's teaching: Marx and Engels did not perceive that evolution is in opposition to their dialectic and historical materialism." 30 Masaryk says that he believes in evolution, but not in Darwinism; that means presumably that he regards the human race as having evolved from a lower to a higher state, but he rejects the doctrine that that evolution has been accomplished solely by the principle of the survival of the fittest. Masaryk has as little use for the philosophy of the war of every man against every man as he has for the philosophy of the class war. Confessing himself a determinist and evolutionist, Masaryk could not but believe that in some measure the past gives us a guide to the future, nor could he help believing in progress. Again I quote from the Otdzka Socidalni:-" The demand that socialists should give a picture of the future is quite justified; it applies also to non-socialists, and in general to all who study society historically. Grillparzer in one of his epigrams smiles at our latest historians who write the history of the future; but in fact the ability to write future history is the peculiar criterion of true historical knowledge. In this sense it may still be said that history is vitae magistra." 31 He continues: " Faith in progress and the exposition of history as development and completion leads necessarily to the deter- mination of the future, to a foresight of that which will develop from the known past. This foresight comes from the determinism of develop- ment; it is the conclusion from the premises of the past; it is strictly scientific prophecy. But we must not wander off into the thirtieth</page><page sequence="9">38 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. century; we will be content to lift a corner of the curtain that veils the next few years." 32 But a little later he adds a characteristic warning: "History, if it is exact, enables us in some, but always in a limited measure, to foresee, but it does not enable me to determine what in a given case I ought to do or not to do. Foresight is not action. Action springs from the will; not only from knowledge." 33 Again Masaryk's intellectual determinism is in conflict with his ethical voluntarism. Even as late as I925 Masaryk was still talking about the moral and philosophical crisis of his generation, as he had done thirty years before. But he never lost his fundamental faith in progress. He will have nothing to do with circular or cyclic theories of history, whether they be Platonic or Marxist. He visits Engels's doctrine of a primitive com- munistic society from which civilization has aberred and towards which it will catastrophically return with trenchant and detailed obloquy. Despite occasional and local periods of decadence, mankind has gradually risen from the savage, "whose only communism was the communism of those who have nothing," to his present position of civilization, which, despite war, oppression and vice, he believed in I925 at least, to be bright with hope for the future. But if Masaryk rejects the Marxist philosophy of history, and refuses to accept what he calls the " hocus pocus " of dialectical materialism, what does he offer in its place ? If he rejects economic forces, " condi- tions of production," as the primum mobile of the historic process, what does he suggest as the alternative ? The problem of Triebkraft, zenouci sila, vis motrix is fundamental to any philosopher of history who believes in something more than an unrelated succession of events. Masaryk begins his answer to it by saying: " The principles of exposition adopted by historians may be unificatory, but they are not simple. This is true of those who, for example, see the unique explanations of history in 'religion'; it is true of Ranke's 'ideas,' and of Buckle's 'reason,' of the 'egoism' of others; it is also true of ' economic conditions.' All these theories have this in common, that they see one chief, or indeed, a single social motive force whereby historical development can be explained. But in fact none of these motive forces is simple. For example, if it is said that reason is the unique cause of historical movement, it is nevertheless necessary to compare and evaluate accurately the intellectual activities of varied origin that are to be found in science, in art, in technique, and so forth. Similarly, religion, the state, and also economic conditions, are complex historical and social activators; and, too, Marx's ' conditions of production' are a synthesis of different and varied forces. The explanation of social phenomena cannot be as simple as that of mechanical operations; the sociologist in particular must not be afraid of very complex formulas; the number and complication of causes and effects in the sphere of social life is great." 34 Masaryk in one place enumerates the more important of the motive forces of the historical process: cosmic</page><page sequence="10">MASARYK'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. 39 and tellurial forces; biological forces, especially those that regulate the growth of population; division of labour; natural sympathy, personal properties; belief in fate or belief in God.35 And scattered throughout Masaryk's writings are passages which indicate that he ascribed a primary effective part to human kindness, to kinship, to political momenta, to reason, emotion and will.36 Masaryk considers art to be no less an efficient historical cause than economic production. " Byron alone," he says, "did more for the political emancipation of the nations than hundreds of secret societies." 37 And again: " Not only literature, but music and the representative arts have a powerful educative and cultural influence. Plato knew that, as can be seen from his exposition of the place of art in his Republic. Not merely among the Greeks, but also to-day poets and artists are the creators of gods and the dogmatic oracles of the nations." 38 Marx and Engels erred, says Masaryk, in ascribing all human action to greed and love of power; joy in service can be equally powerful. "Perhaps everybody would like to be a small Napoleon, but normal men like equally to obey, and they obey gladly."39 Masaryk refuses to arrange these manifold and complicated moving forces in any hierarchy of logical or causal precedence; nor does he agree that any one of them is supreme; he rejects utterly Engel's thesis of a Triebkraft der Triebkrdfte, a motor motorum, or supreme historic cause. Even more emphatically does he reject instinct, the revolutionary instinct or the ambitious instinct or what not, as an historical motive force. He says: " The revolutionary instinct ? I have very little respect for such instincts, very little use for instincts at all, for they probably don't exist. . . . If revolutionary instinct is the moral justifica- tion of the claim to equality, then the ambitious instinct would be a justification not only of Napoleon I but also of Napoleon III, and, by the same argument, of capitalism. Instinct would justify Nietzsche and all aristocrats without distinction. Instinct-that is moral chaos." 40 Masaryk refuses to simplify the historical process into either a Marxist class war or a Darwinian jungle conflict of every man against his neigh- bour. All war is not class war, nor is all economic conflict war. "The French Revolution," he says, " had its parents not only in the Physiocrats, but also in Pascal and the Jansenists, in philosophers and politicians. Misery was indeed a very powerful cause of the French Revolution, but not its only or even its strongest cause. Modern revolutionism exists not only in the proletariate, but also in all classes, and it has its origin in discontent with the religious, ecclesiastical, philosophical, political, and social, as well as with the economic regime." 41 Masaryk maintains that the class structure is not nearly as simple as Engels would have it, and that factors other than economic are determinative of class; nor is all vice to be found in the capitalists and all virtue in the proletariate. Anyhow, he asks, why is a class system as such morally wrong ? 42 But this is all negative criticism. What was Masaryk's own positive theory of the nature of the historical process ? It is difficult to say</page><page sequence="11">40 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. concisely, just because he so stoutly rejected the temptation to over- simplification. But out of the critical arguments of the Otdzka Socidlni and Rusko a Evropa a positive and concrete, even if not systematic, philosophy of history emerges. Using his own words as far as possible I would summarise it thus: There is no objective dialectical process in history, and no dialectical opposition in things themselves.43 In history, as in nature, there is a process of gradual development, a process which is not catastrophic; 44 violent revolutions more often have retarded than advanced the develop- ment of society. This development is driven by a great variety of motive forces. That which develops is not things but conscious man; 45 even economic development proceeds from subjective motives, from human needs. Once you abstract consciousness from science and philosophy, you destroy science and philosophy altogether, and with them economic science and also economic materialism.46 There are indeed catastrophes in history, but catastrophes have not the epochal and universal importance which Marx ascribes to them, nor are they all merely economic. We to-day more rightly appreciate the fullness of social development, and posit an infinite number of infinitesimal modifications by means of which development, and in the long run, progress, are realised.47 There must be some metaphysical basis of this development, and because it is the development of human beings, that basis cannot be materialism; and because it is a progressive development the metaphysical basis cannot be atheism. Despite all his professed dislike of antiquated teleological theories, Masaryk confesses that he cannot subscribe to a doctrine of absolute accidents.48 If history is the story of the development and progress of man, it must therefore be the story of the development and the progress of minds, of ideas. Masaryk is first and last an idealist, both in the political and philosophical sense of the word. His whole approach in his historical writings is that of a man who believes that ultimately thought is the only real and the only creator. That can be seen from the way he approached Russian history in his monumental Rusko a Evropa. How the concatena- tion of thought from generation to generation works he tells us in Otdzka Socidini: Every thinker and worker is psychologically linked with his predecessors and hands on his ideas and the results of his work to other thinkers. That is the rational thread of history. But the work of one generation is not merely a continuation of that which has already developed, for progress is not mere summation. Every man who thinks critically collates what his predecessors have bequeathed to him with what he can add thereto; he criticises, selects, makes a synthesis and transforms what he has selected, welding it into a whole in the furnace of his own spirit. Progress is not achieved merely by the adding up of given units; progress is not to be found in eclecticism and syncretism, but in organically creative synthesis-that is the only way that new ideas and deeds can grow out of the old. History is not only our logical</page><page sequence="12">MASARYK'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. 41 laboratory; it is also the scene of action of our feelings and strivings. In history our desire and longing for achievement are realised.49 Since history is the history of thought it is the history of individual men and women, for masses and classes, states and nations cannot think; only the individual has a mind. And because of the inevitable inequality of men, history is largely made by individuals who are eminent in virtue, courage, genius or assiduity, not solely by mobs and masses.50 To emphasise the individual's part in history is not to ascribe all human action to egoism, for individualism and egoism are not synonymous; there is not only antagonism between the individual and society, they also have common interests in well-being.51 Masaryk further assumes that because history is the history of think- ing individuals it must have an ethical basis. One feels on reading his critique of Marxism that the most damning fault of Marxism in Masaryk's eyes is its positivist amoralism, its attempt to eliminate right and wrong and the moral purpose from history.52 Masaryk's ethics is based on the observed fact that we make moral judgments (as indeed do Marx and Engels themselves); everyone engaged in politics, and in political economy, makes moral judgments, for his aims are determined ethically. Ethics is as necessary to action as logic is to thinking. Socialist planning, any planning, makes ethical assumptions.53 The problem of revolution is not one of social dynamics but the ethical problem of the morality of force and violence.54 The State has an ethical basis; its purposes are ethical and cultural, as well as economic ;55 if the nation has any absolute rights, they are based on ethics; 56 religion too is concerned with the relations of man to man as well as with the relations of man to God.57 Even socialism and communism are and must be based on ethics. "Why," says Masaryk, "are Marx and Engels against capitalist exploitation ? Merely because the capitalist system is economically unsound ? Or because it is wrong, because it offends the feelings of humanity ? If capitalism was merely unsound economically Marx would probably never have written Das Kapital. If capitalism, as Marx admits, was economically better than the earlier system-why must we change it for a communist system ? Why must we strive for equality ? Why and by what right must we accept communism ? Merely because the Communist Manifesto threatens the 'rebels' ? Why are they rebels ? Unless we have some internal argument for equality, springing from our own souls, then Marx will only be able to oppose capitalistic violence with communistic violence-whence then is to come that king- dom of liberty which Engels so exaltedly offers us ? From violence and still more violence ? 58 The fact of conscience, the sense of a moral imperative cannot be explained away by Engels's doctrine of a morality relative to the economic conditions which create it.59 Masaryk sees in the historical process not only a great moral drama, but also the necessary counterpart of morality, religion-religion, not theology. Masaryk disliked theology and ecclesiasticism with all the</page><page sequence="13">42 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. fervour of the rationalist radicalism of the nineties. But yet he clung to what he called " religion " with almost desperate zeal; and nothing is so amorphous and evasive as religion without theology or a church. Of religion's part in human history Masaryk has no doubt; he knows its strength in primitive societies; 60 he sees the basis of many of the differences between the nations not in mystical national characteristics, but in the different ethos of Catholic, Protestant, and Orthodox; he exaggerates the influence of the Protestant reformation; he believes that to-day religion still plays a great part, and that it will continue to do so. He says: " Goethe and Kant saw better and further than Marx. Leaving aside the impossibility of materialism in general, it is a priori most unlikely that religion, which has hitherto played so great a r6le, should just cease to be and be replaced by positivist science; every analogy makes it more probable, even from the evolutionist point of view, which Marx and Engels profess, that out of the present religious crisis will come a further and higher development of religion." 61 I find it one of the weaknesses of Masaryk's teaching that, though he always insists on the importance of religion, he never tells us what his religion is. An admiration of Jesus and a somewhat vague belief in Providence seem to be the substance of his theology. To him religion is primarily ethical and practical. In as far as it affects his view of history it appears in his faith that the two superior moving forces in history have been and will be work and love. I quote two memorable passages to conclude this lecture: " Work, real work, is small jobs, everyday work. Just as every science is built upon everyday phenomena so the real worker is he who knows how to do detailed, everyday essential work, and who does it willingly. . . . The so-called great deeds, heroic actions, heroic revolutions are greater in idea than in fact. Utopia comes by patient labour. . . . The heroes of the future will declare themselves by care for that which interests no one, by doing what is tedious and humdrum. Hitherto there have been few such; people would rather sacrifice their lives than work. Great epochs are not made in a moment; history, no more than nature, proceeds by leaps. Revolu- tionary changes, though they appear to happen suddenly, have been long prepared in obscurity. ... On the one side is lack of method and order, the occasional appearance of what is called genius, Bohemian disorderliness, excitement, nervous agitation; on the other, certainty of aim, clear thinking, beauty and purity of life and deed, and actual activity; not fantasy, but poetry; not muscularity but strength." 62 But to praise work for work's sake, says Masaryk, is to make a fetish of labour, as Marx did. Work must be for an object ethically determined, and the ultimate ethical determinant, of politics as well as history, is love. " Love," he says, " which is effective, active; not sentimentality or philandering; muscular Christianity-as the Yankees say. True love is persevering, constant, considerate. It does not suffice that I should feel pity merely when some wretch comes into sight momentarily to</page><page sequence="14">MASARYK'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY. 43 trouble my complacency. True love will never know peace and content- ment while physical and moral misery exist. Love means to work continuously and with open eyes against misery, even when we don't directly see it, since it is mere sentimental egoism to be stirred up to moral indignation only once in a Hungarian month. Occasional benevo- lence is not love. . . . Love does not ask for martyrs . . . for love is mutual and demands no sacrifices .... Long ago Havlicek said: " In the past men have died for their country, for the well-being of their nation-but we to-day for the same cause will live and work." 63 Such in summary form is what I believe to be Masaryk's philosophy of history. With much of it I cannot agree. I believe he failed to appreciate the fundamental strength of the Marxist argument and the potency of Marxist politics. But what I believe is not to the point. Whether Masaryk was right or wrong in this argument or that cannot take away from his eminence nor derogate the greatness of his influence. His teaching and work became the basis of social democracy and modern liberalism in his own country and profoundly affected political thought and practice in the whole of Europe. None will deny, be he Marxist or agnostic, Czechoslovak or Englishman, that that influence, the influence of Masaryk's work and love for humanity, has been for good. 1 T. G.
