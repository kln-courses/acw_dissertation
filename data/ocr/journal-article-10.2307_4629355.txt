<plain_text><page sequence="1">KUNIYOSHI'S MINAMOTO RAIKO AND THE EARTH SPIDER: DEMONS AND PROTEST IN LATE TOKUGAWA JAPAN BY MELINDA TAKEUCHI To JUDGE FROM THE PAUCITY OF SUPERNATURAL subjects in the canon of art historical literature in Japanese, one might conclude that the artists of that country rarely depicted ghosts and demons. Japanese art historians view such themes as whim- sical curiosities peripheral to the mainstream of "serious" art. A major exhibition of ukiyoea held at the Tokyo National Museum in 1984, for ex- ample, included only four works depicting spirits or monsters among the 698 objects on display.' Recently, however, Western scholars have be- gun to discover this treasure trove of fascinating material.2 Indeed, the wealth of demonic imagery so vividly portrayed in the legends, paintings, prints, and netsuke of Japan offers a rich source of information about important artistic and cul- tural issues of its day. The depiction of supernatural themes reached an apogee during the nineteenth century, an age when artists vied with each other to satisfy the public's quickened appetite for images of the bizarre and the macabre. In response to the challenge, illustrators turned back into their own cultural past, outwards towards the art of other lands, and inwards to the realm of the imagination. This article will explore some of the icono- graphical and political ramifications of supernat- ural imagery around the middle of the nine- teenth century as revealed in the famous triptych by Utagawa Kuniyoshib (1797-1861), Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider (Minamoto Raiko kokan tsuchigumo saku y6kai no zu,C Fig. 1 and 2), is- sued in 1843.3 The array of monsters in the background of Kuniyoshi's composition comprises a virtual vade mecum of East Asian demonology. Where did the artist acquire such a cornucopia of motifs? And what did the images mean? To pur- sue these questions we will consider Kuniyoshi's biography and oeuvre, sources of his imagery, the cultural context of the supernatural during Kuniyoshi's times, and historical circumstances at the time of the triptych's release. Raiko and the Earth Spider represents anything but a frivolous array of amusing images. It had considerable meaning to the Edo population at the time of its release; it even became something of a cause celebre in the 1840s. The conception and recep- tion of Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider also raise the larger issues of government censorship of art, and of social protest by artists at the end of the Tokugawa (or Edo) period (1600-1868). Kuniyoshi's Biography and Oeuvre Utagawa Kuniyoshi typified the proverbial "child of Edo" (the Edokkod). Because his biography has been given in English elsewhere,4 we will concern ourselves here primarily with a general overview of his career, centering our attention upon those aspects relevant to Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider. Kuniyoshi was born into an artisanal family who lived in Nihombashi,e the plebian downtown of the capital known as the shitamachi f or low city. His father was a dyer of fabrics, and thus as a member of the townsman (or ch5ning) class, the family occupied a low status in the Tokugawa Confucian class system of samurai-farmer-artisan-merchant; in essence the family combined the occupations of the two lowest classes. Because he showed early promise as a draughts- man, Kuniyoshi was accepted into the studio of Utagawa Toyokunih (1769-1825) probably around 181 1, at the age of fourteen (by Western count). Kuniyoshi remained there until he was about eighteen and then struck out on his own. Some accounts suggest that there may have been trouble between Toyokuni and Kuniyoshi because of Kuniyoshi's intractable disposition.5 One contemporary source, the Mumei-o zuihitsu,' a compilation of biographies of ukiyoe artists, states that after receiving a few commissions early in his career (more precisely, around the Bunka' era, 1804-18), Kuniyoshi gave up printmaking until late in Bunseik (1818-30), when he was awarded a commission to produce a set of 108 Heroes of the Popular Suikoden (Tsfizoku suikoden goketsu hyakuhachinin,' Fig. 3).6 This series, published by Kagaya,m was begun in 1827, when Kuniyoshi had attained the relatively advanced age (for an unknown artist) of twenty- nine. It was based on the Ming novel Outlaws of the Marsh (Shuihu zhuan), a work in vernacular Chinese which had been reworked and translated into Japanese by the novelist and poet Takizawa</page><page sequence="2">6 MELINDA TAKEUCHI Bakin' (1767-1848) in 1805.7 The novel treated a brotherhood of bandits bound together by su- perhuman strength, phenomenal accomplishment in the martial arts, and disdain for the con- straints of conventional society. These Robin Hoods acted according to their own elaborate code of chivalry. Their dramatically improbable triumphs over corrupt officials or bullies in the government constituted the focus of the action. The theme appealed mightily to the anti-social ethos of the Edo townsmen, just as it had done to their counterparts in Ming China; Edo towns- men were quick to see parallels with their own on- going battle against a draconian political regime. Kuniyoshi's larger-than-life heroes earned him an enthusiastic following almost overnight. His illus- trations for Suikoden established his reputation in the world of ukiyoe and demonstrated that his ge- nius and temperament lay in depictions of heroic swashbucklers doing battle with both human and supernatural forces. This subject he exploited with great effect to the very end of his career. By a process typically Japanese, Suikoden was ex- panded to include a corresponding set of 108 Japanese heroes. The enjoyment of prints glorify- ing mighty warriors of the past was very likely cal- culated to annoy and embarrass the emasculated samurai class, whose martial prowess had declined during the long Tokugawa peace to the point that the successor to the fifth shogun Tsunayoshio (1646-1709) could not even hold a military in- spection due to the deterioration of the shogunal weaponry.8 The noble way of the warrior had be- come an empty cliche by Kuniyoshi's day. Kuniyoshi's own character seems to have been something like that of the warriors he loved to depict. He was described by his contemporaries as being an oyabunP-a word used to describe the boss of a gang of toughs.9 Another source speaks of the braggadocio of his demeanor (demb6 hadaq).1O He quite literally cut a colorful figure, for he had designs of warriors tattooed all over his body. Indeed, the vogue for full-body tat- toos among the townsmen that swept Edo in the late 1820s and 1830s was based on Kuniyoshi's Suikoden designs. Kuniyoshi may well have been the one to start the fad, which probably was in- spired by the vivid descriptions of the tattoos in the original Shuihu zhuan."1 Tattooing, a custom which had begun with the branding of crimi- nals, was (predictably) discouraged by the Toku- gawa government.'2 It became especially popular among the manual laborers whose work required them to expose their bodies. Although it is true that Kuniyoshi frequented circles of practitioners of comic verse, his relatively low position even in Edo townsman society is underscored by the fact that one of his daughters married a fishmonger, and the other, a fortune teller. Even the most cursory survey of Kuniyoshi's art reveals a fertile imagination and extraordi- nary versatility. Although he never assumed its leadership, as one of the prominent artists of the Utagawa School he produced paintings, in addi- tion to designs for prints (including privately pub- lished, high-quality commemorative prints known as surimonor), and illustrated books. Kuniyoshi incorporated into his works Western techniques, as well as styles taken from Tosa,s Rimpa,t and Maruyamau painting. His eclecticism is typical of late Edo-period art. This admixture of many styles is evident, for example, in his portrait of Oboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio' (Fig. 4), from the series Portraits of Loyal Warriors. It combines the traditional sense of strong design, facility for meticulous detail, empirical observation of a living model, and Western techniques such as foreshortening and shading. The latter is particularly effective in the variety of flesh tones modelling the face, which are not visible in reproduction. The artist employed a muted range of colors, with a dark blue background, yellow breastplate, black outer robe, green formal trousers, and greyish-purple accents. Kuniyoshi has designed an ennobling tribute to Yuranosuke, the leader of the forty- seven masterless samurai whose revenge for the wronging of their lord (he was forced to commit suicide by the government) constituted one of the most important events in Edo cultural history. The event marked one of the few occasions when Tokugawa-period samurai lived up to the townsmen's image of the ideal warrior. The government, as usual, was cast as the villain. Few of Kuniyoshi's works show such tasteful restraint, however. Kuniyoshi was active when the so-called "decadent" style was as its peak. Almost all the literature-in Japanese and in English-treating popular art and culture of the late Edo period parrots the notion that the society was in the final stages of decay (taihaiw).13 Proliferation in the number of ukiyoe prints (the sign of healthy finances), sheer technical virtuosity, as well as the vitality and energy of nineteenth-century townsman culture argue against this assessment; farmers and samurai may have been impoverished and demoralized by fiscal and natural misfortunes, but the urban class</page><page sequence="3">DEMONS AND PROTEST IN LATE TOKUGAWA JAPAN 7 on the whole thrived. Whatever the complex reasons for the stylistic change in ukiyoe, as the nineteenth century dawned the limpid, rarified elegance of Utamaro's (1754-1806) style gave way to an amplified boldness, the demand for elaboration and the application of brilliant- and to modern eyes, jarring-color. Thanks to new kinds of dyes, prints now could rival paintings in their chromatic intensity. To gratify the new nineteenth-century taste for layered complexity, artists merged unrelated subjects into a single work. This is seen, for example, in the numerous nineteenth-century prints pairing famous actors or courtesans with various stations on the Tokaidoy road, just as noh and kabuki plays had kaleidoscopically brought together events from different historical periods. Because Kuniyoshi was associated in the pub- lic's mind with portraits of warriors (musha-ez), he earned the nickname "Musha-e Kuniyoshi." The epithet masks his enormous versatility. His in- terest in depicting demons probably went hand in hand with the genre of warrior prints (since legends often demanded that warriors battle su- pernatural forces), but Kuniyoshi developed the rendition of monsters into an independent genre. His demons were often the outlet for playful parody, as, for example, in sets like his Bake- mono chuCshingura,aa a depiction of the forty- seven masterless samurai as humorous monsters. In addition to his numerous supernatural im- ages, Kuniyoshi produced many landscapes, which range in style from works heavily influenced by Western art to those that are purely Japanese in theme and presentation. A large body of his work shows a keen sense of humor, a sharp eye for observing the familiar world around him, and a disregard for traditional subject matter; I know of no other Japanese artist, for exam- ple, who recorded grafitti.14 Cats comprise one of Kuniyoshi's favorite motifs and appear in contexts ranging from monsters, parodies of inmates of the Yoshiwaraac brothels, and erotica. "Sparrow"- cats, for example, shows Kuniyoshi's use of cats to symbolize the man-about-town (known as a "spar- row" because of his ubiquitous hopping around) being met at the dock by his kitty courtesan (Fig. 5). Such works fall under the rubric of giga,ab "playful painting," which often have strong over- tones of social satire, as seen, for example, in the most famous of such works, the Animal Frolic Scroll of the late twelfth century. Other sub- jects to which Kuniyoshi turned his brush in- cluded beautiful women, actors, depictions of the classical poets, historical themes, famous places, flowers, fish and waterlife of all kinds, and mis- cellaneous sketches. A measure of his success can be gleaned from his productivity: his output has been estimated at fifteen to twenty thousand designs. 1 5 Raiko and the Earth Spider: Iconography The subject of the triptych is one of the legends surrounding Minamoto Yorimitsuad (948-1021; Raiko is the Sino-Japanese pronunciation of the characters Yorimitsu). Raiko was a member of the Seiwa Genjiae branch of the Minamoto, a family known as the "teeth and claws" of the dominant Fujiwaraaf clan. He attained a high rank at the sumptuous court of Fujiwara Michinagaag because of his legendary skill in the martial arts. Over the centuries Raiko's biography became overlain with accounts of miraculous feats against supernatural forces; his deeds were celebrated in genres as varied as the classical Heike monogatari,ah medieval noh and tale literature, and Edo period kabuki. The scene Kuniyoshi depicted in Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider (Fig. 1) comes from one of these narrative embellishments, Tale of the Earth Spider (Tsuchigumo soshiai), dating from the Muromachi period (1333-1573).16 It depicts an episode in which Raiko has been overpowered by the evil magic of the vicious Earth Spider and has fallen into a dream-like trance. He will not be able to recover until his retainers (known as the "Four Guardian Kings," or Shitennoai) have slain the monster. Raiko, asleep at the right, and his strongmen are arranged across the foreground in a compo- sition that fills all three sheets. The names of the retainers are identified in cartouches; from right to left are depicted the elegant Urabe Suetakeak (950-1022), the fierce Watanabe Tsunaal (954- 1024), the formidable Usui Sadamitsuam (954- 1021), and the demonic-looking Sakata Kintokian (act. ca. 1000)-who physically resembles tradi- tional depictions of the four guardian kings and is colored red. The Earth Spider and his rabble of over fifty hideous creatures compose a dense curtain of tangled forms that erupt across the sur- face in a dramatic diagonal just behind Raiko and his warriors. The Earth Spider is shown in the act of raising his web to enmesh the slumbering Raiko and drag him into the nether zone. The spider and his diabolical horde are invisible to the retainers. Watanabe Tsuna and Sakata Kintoki while away the time playing go, obliviousto tohe</page><page sequence="4">8 MELINDA TAKEUCHI menace, while on either side of the competing companions, Urabe Suetake and Usui Sadamitsu sense something disturbing in the air and are straining to detect it. To enhance the sense of unnatural goings-on, the color scheme is espe- cially restrained for ukiyoe in the 1840s: browns, greys, subtle reds, and flesh-tones are used for the figures of Raiko and the retainers, while the demons in the background are rendered primar- ily in monochrome. Kuniyoshi heightened their grotesqueness by touching their lips and the in- sides of their mouths with eerie pink accents. At first glance, the narrative element in Raiko and the Earth Spider seems simple and straightfor- ward: Raiko sleeps, the retainers keep watch, and the demons mass their forces for an attack. In actuality, however, Kuniyoshi has conflated two motifs, the legend of Minamoto Raiko and an an- cient theme entitled The Night Parade of a Hun- dred Demons (hyakki yako or yagy6ao). The identifi- cation of this iconography appears in a number of nineteenth-century sources, including an en- try for 1843 in a compilation of biographies of Utagawa-school artists, the Ukiyo eshi Utagawa ret- suden.ap 17 The kaleidoscopic admixture of unre- lated elements in a single work is, as we have seen, one of the hallmarks of the so-called "decadent" style. No scholar has yet made the connection be- tween the theme of the nocturnal parade of demons and an episode in the Chinese legend of Zhong Kuiaq (known to the Japanese as Shoki), a failed examination candidate of the Tang dy- nasty (618-906). Zhong Kui committed suicide in frustration and shame, but his continuing story must surely be the origin of the Night Parade motif. Zhong Kui's troubled spirit returned to the court of the Ming-huang emperor (r. 713- 756), where he served as a queller of demons and took on a demonic guise himself.'8 One of the central anecdotes of the Zhong Kui legend con- cerns Zhong Kui's changing residences by dead of night. Zhong Kui's Night Excursion by Gong Kai (1222-ca. 1304) is a Chinese version of this scene (Fig. 6). The unlikely nocturnal entourage con- sisted of Zhong Kui's demons, his sister, his var- ious pets, his household possessions, and a pleas- ingly abundant supply of wine. The conception of the nocturnal activities of the hundred demons entered the repertoire of Japanese superstition during the late Heian period. An entry for 1144 in the Taiki ,ar the diary of Fujiwara Yorinaga, as mentions a sighting of the hundred demons; the Kamakura-period Shfikaish3at lists unlucky days, ascertained by yin- yangau divination, when people were compelled to refrain from going out at night because of the danger of encountering the demon parade.'9 Kuniyoshi's demons comprise a motley array of jostling, grimacing, leering monstrosities based on a prodigious number of literary and artistic sources. The artist included humans of distorted and sinister mien, skeletons in partial or total decomposition, composites of animal, vegetable, or utensil-shaped heads on human bodies, and a bestiary comprised of malevolent-looking horses, tigers, frogs, or snakes. Some of the creatures are decidedly phallic in character (figs. 2-5, 2-6,. 2-10, and 2-26). Many of these monsters can be traced to traditional Japanese sources. A cluster of copies of what is probably a late twelfth-century original depicting various kinds of demonic creatures survives. The most celebrated among these is the so-called Handscroll of the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons, dated to the sixteenth century and once attributed to Tosa Mitsunobuav (ca. 1439-1521, Fig. 7). A related version from the Edo period has labels appended to the creatures and thus provides precious clues to the rationale behind the designation of the various categories of such monsters. Although the demons in this group of tradi- tional representations do not necessarily resemble the physical form of Kuniyoshi's creatures, they indicate the generic types. Creatures in this cat- egory include the hairy flea-faced creature in the central sheet, identified in the Edo-period copy as a "great ant demon" (oari y6kai,aw Fig. 2-7), the "snail demon" (katasumuri y6kai,ax Fig. 2-21), the hag in court makeup (a shikome,aY Fig. 2-17), and the "bird-helmet demon" (torikabuto no yokai, Fig. 2-15). The bird-helmet demon stems from the ancient Japanese belief that tools and utensils transform themselves after a hundred years into animate and often sinister creatures.20 This belief helps to explain other demons in Kuniyoshi's triptych, including the comman- der's standard (umajirushi,ba Fig. 2-4), which has sprouted nine skulls, and the various swords and clubs that thrust forward with a seeming life of their own. The creature in the lower left of the central sheet is the "one-eye" (hitotsume,bb Fig. 2- 13), a kind of East Asian cyclops, described in the labelled version of the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons. Komatsu Shigemibc believes that many of the images in this cluster of so-called Hundred Demons</page><page sequence="5">DEMONS AND PROTEST IN LATE TOKUGAWA JAPAN 9 scrolls were originally inspired during the Heian period by the Han dynasty Classic of Mountains and Seas (Shanhaijingbd).2I By the nineteenth cen- tury they had become totally assimilated into Japanese folklore. The long-nosed tengube (Fig. 2-6) was originally a Chinese bird-headed demon. Creatures which resemble bird-headed tengu ap- pear in Gong Kai's Chinese rendition of Zhong Kui's entourage (Fig. 6). The characters for tengu appear in one of Japan's earliest historical doc- uments, the eighth-century Chronicles of Japan, which depends totally on the Chinese language;22 by the nineteenth century, however, the tengu too was thoroughly domesticated. Other of Kuniyoshi's demons are associated with Buddhist imagery. Indeed, the very theme of Kuniyoshi's triptych strongly calls to mind rendi- tions of the legend of the attack of Mara, the de- mon king, upon Shakyamuni, as seen, for exam- ple, in the eighth-century Sutra of Past and Present Karma, one of the earliest surviving depictions of demons in Japan (Fig. 8). In this episode of the Buddha's biography, just as he reached enlight- enment he was set upon by the forces of dark- ness and ignorance. Grotesque creatures, self- propelled weapons, and natural elements such as fire and wind (the latter in anthropomorphic form as the Wind God) converge upon the medi- tating figure, in the same way that the Earth Spi- der's motley group attempts to engulf Raiko. Actual demons common to the two works in- clude the elephant (Fig. 2-20), a chicken-headed creature (Fig. 2-29), and one of the Kings of Hell (standing to the lower left of the Buddha in the early sutra, Fig. 2-22).23 Another Bud- dhist monster traditionally associated with hell scenes, and also found in Zhong Kui's Night Excur- sion (Fig. 6), is the horned onibf (Fig. 2-1), who administered sadistic tortures in verbal and picto- rial descriptions of the Buddhist hells. In keep- ing with the nineteenth-century taste for inten- sification, the face of Kuniyoshi's oni is painted with designs used in Chinese and Japanese the- ater to symbolize strength or power. Also Bud- dhist in inspiration are the skeletons in the central and left-hand sheets (symbols of the transience of earthly existence) and the red-headed transi (Fig. 2-25), a corpse in decomposition, who represents a hungry ghost (gakibg in Japanese, see Fig. 10). To the right of the King of Hell is a haradashi no y6kai,bh or "belly-sticking-out demon" (Fig. 2- 19), which presents a disturbing image read either as an unsightly female head with deformed pink gums, surmounted by a smaller feminine head and shoulders, or a small woman with a mon- strous face in her belly. This creature may trace its origins to a type of figure with correspond- ing disfigurations of anatomy depicted in a ninth- century Chinese rendition of Mdra's Attack on the Buddha.24 The Red-Robed Darumabi (Fig. 2-24), of course, is the First Patriarch in the pantheon of Zen Buddhism; here his normal grotesqueness has been intensified by the glowering face and the company he has been made to keep. He ap- pears to be inciting the unsavory crowd forward with his whisk. Traditional depictions of emaci- ated arhats (ascetic disciples of the Buddha) may have inspired the glaring wraith with the beetling brows in the bottom right of the central sheet (Fig. 2-3). With an ironical touch, Kuniyoshi also included three of Japan's "Seven Lucky Gods," Daikokub] (Fig. 2-9), Ebisubk (Fig. 2-11), and Fukurokujubl (Fig. 2-10). These deities have been depicted as anything but lucky, however: Fukurokuju has been furnished with a third eye in the middle of his forehead and an angry expression on his face, Daikoku wields a sword, and Ebisu, although smiling, offers instead of his usual fish (a symbol of his bounty) a tray of skulls. Daikoku appears to have a snake wrapped around his head. Snakes, toads, and tigers (Fig. 2-23 and 2- 14) are traditionally associated with witchcraft or magic. Such animals were considered temporary manifestations of other entities and were thought to be capable of transforming themselves at will. The toad in this context goes back at least as far as the Han dynasty, where it appeared as an attribute of Xiwangmubm (Japanese: Seiobo), the Queen Mother of the West. Xiwangmu was believed to have mastered the secrets of immortality by means of her magic powers.25 Toads accompanied Taoist hermits and famous sorcerers as well. Kuniyoshi has invested his snaggle-toothed toad with particular maleficence. Besides calling upon an ancient repertoire of demonography, Kuniyoshi also used images of Edo-period vintage. Lantern demons such as that shown at the top of the left-hand sheet (Fig. 2- 16) probably owe their conceptual origin to the "lantern night festivities" of Zhong Kui, but be- came extremely popular in Japan with the per- formance of the kabuki play Tokaido Yotsuya Ghost Tales (T6kaid6 yotsuya kaidanbn). Pride of place among the newly-created demons is given to the skull-topped, long-necked, hideously grinning fig- ure at the top of the central sheet (Fig. 2-8). This is an exotic rokurokubi,bo one of the "fly-</page><page sequence="6">10 MELINDA TAKEUCHI ing heads" proscribed in a governmental edict of 1808. We will return to this edict below. The most recent newcomer to Japan's array of phantasmagoria, the rokurokubi was discovered by artists and storytellers in the Wakan sansai zuebp of 1713 (Fig. 9), a compilation based on the Ming encyclopedia Sancai tuhui.26 Listed under the sec- tion on "Barbarians," the rokurokubi, inhabitants of the imaginary land called Daishaba,bq were de- scribed as creatures capable of stretching their necks to any length; some species could even de- tatch their heads completely, while the rest of the body slept, to roam nocturnally in search of food. Once it took hold in the popular imagination, the rokurokubi appeared frequently in nineteenth- century ukiyoe, usually clad as courtesans and en- tertainers. Some of the images may well be of Kuniyoshi's own devising. These include the monster with the upside-down face in the left-hand sheet (Fig. 2- 18) or the creature described in a contemporary diary as a "toothless" (ha no naki,br Fig. 2-5).27 When we consider the number of sources Kuniyoshi brought together in this triptych, the scope is astonishing. No single modelbook could have provided the artist with such an array of images, and no one legend or cluster of leg- ends can supply a rationale for the appearance of such a diversity of creatures. Does this cir- cumstance represent mere artistic extravagance, or did Kuniyoshi have something specific in mind when he created Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spi- der? Cultural Context: The Multilayered Associa- tions of the Supernatural in Tokugawa Society At this juncture of the search for meanings in Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider, it is useful to broaden the discussion to the various functions and implications of the supernatural in Kuniyoshi's times-to move from iconography (the identification of images) to iconology (their conceptual or symbolic significance). Traditional Japanese took for granted the interpenetration of different realms of existence as a wholly natural phenomenon, a concept central both to Shinto and to Buddhist belief. The Scroll of Hungry Ghosts (Fig. 10), dated to the latter half of the twelfth century, gives graphic visual form to the notion of the intermingling worlds of humans and spirits. Pathetic red-haired figures of starved beings from the Realm of Hungry Ghosts, one of the Six Levels of Existence in Buddhist cosmology, are depicted mingling invisibly with the residents of the Realm of Human Beings, the latter blissfully unaware of their hideous companions. The assumption of the coexistence of different levels of reality in a single place and time is evident in Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider. The employment of the supernatural as enter- tainment, however, lies outside the sphere of or- thodox religious belief and is tied to the con- cept of the bakemono,bs which lies in the gray zone along the border of religion and supersti- tion. The two Chinese characters which make up the compound mean literally the "transfor- mation" (bake is another reading for the charac- ter ka) of "things" (mono), that is to say, "things which change their shape."28 Yoshida Yujibt char- acterizes the bakemono as follows: According to modern usage, the word bakemono might properly be translated as "monster" or "hobgoblin;" in an earlier and more general sense, however, it refers to "shape-changes," and to creatures or objects which have mysteriously assumed (or seemed to assume) forms or a state of animation not normally their own. Thus, it is scarcely surprising to find in Japanese ghost stories and tales of the supernatural, both ancient and modern, a relatively large role played by assorted bakemono, some quaintly whimsical, and others more horrific.29 As Yoshida's discussion reveals, the bakemono was closely linked in the Japanese mind with entertainment. Superstition frequently joined hands with sensationalism, as seen in medieval handscrolls such as the Tales of Ghosts30 (Fig. 11). In the section reproduced here, a woman is shown roasting chestnuts on a hibachi in a dilapidated mansion at night-the ideal setting for a ghost story. Suddenly a disembodied white hand appears over the edge of the hearth to beg a share of the delicacies. In the interest of a good scare, even benevolent deities could become the subject of narratives devoid of didactic, allegorical, or pious aspects, as seen in the tale, Monster Jizo (Obake Jizobu ). Here the traditional protector of women and children is transformed into a hideous and terrifying creature.31 Indeed, monstrous or transformed creatures, including inanimate objects, are at the crux of the Japanese enjoyment of the supernatural. Japanese distinguish between bakemono (also called yokaibv), which are demonic creatures, on the one hand, and human ghosts (yfireibt), on the other. This distinction has a parallel in Chinese practice, although the Chinese use different terminology: guibx for demons, and</page><page sequence="7">DEMONS AND PROTEST IN LATE TOKUGAWA JAPAN 11 shenby for ghosts.32 In Japan the types of monsters in the former category are said to number in excess of five hundred.33 Certain animals such as toads, tigers, and snakes, believed capable of transforming themselves into other forms at will-the essence of the bakemono-are also classified into the category of demonic creatures. Renditions of demonic creatures coincide vir- tually with the earliest surviving Buddhist paint- ing in Japan and were didactic in nature. The seventh-century Tamamushi Shrine depicted the temptation of Siddhartha in a former incarna- tion by Indra in the guise of a demon.34 Hu- man ghosts, however, although popular in pre- Edo Japanese literature-one thinks immediately of the vengeful Lady Rokujobz in the Tale of Genji-had to wait until the nineteenth century for their hour to arrive in art. Indeed, some of the most spectacular ghosts ever devised by the human imagination appear in Edo ukiyoe and kabuki. Kuniyoshi's depictions of human ghosts, however, almost never rise above the routine. His single-sheet print showing Oiwa,f the deformed spectral heroine of the kabuki play Tokaido Yot- suya Ghost Tales, (Fig. 12), for example, simply reproduces Oiwa's traditional guise on the stage. Kuniyoshi expended very little creative imagina- tion on the image, which is almost indistinguish- able from depictions of Oiwa by minor ukiyoe artists of the time, such as one created about ten years earlier by Shunkosai Hokushucb (act. 1808- 32).35 Kuniyoshi evidently viewed the production of the human ghosts of kabuki as a routine matter. Conversely, however, none of Kuniyoshi's contem- poraries could rival his superb renditions of the older type of demonic monsters. These were the natural adjunct of the warrior prints which had so fired his creative imagination. Needless to say, it is the demonic creature (as opposed to human ghost) who populates the background of Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider; the inscription labels these monsters as yokai. For reasons that are not entirely clear, there was an enormous upsurge in the popularity of supernatural themes around the beginning of the nineteenth century.36 This phenomenon is tied to a parallel development on the Chinese mainland slightly earlier. Yuan Meilc (1716- 97) became widely acclaimed as a writer of ghost stories, and his friend Luo Pingcd(1733- 99) gained fame painting ghosts.37 The rise of interest in the supernatural in Japan coincided with the proliferation in production of ukiyoe prints (indicative of a mass audience) and with the coming of age of vaudeville theater (yosece)-in short, with the heyday of Edo townsman culture. A pronounced taste for the morbid flourished in many guises. The nineteenth century, for example, saw a boom in the number of curiosity shows (misemonocf) on the dusty streets of Edo, many of which featured gruesome or necrophilic themes.38 One exhibit in this vein by a certain Izumiya Kichibeicg featured a wildly successful haunted teahouse. Spurred by the profits, this designer (whose specialty was kabuki stage sets for ghost plays) installed another exhibit displaying mannekins in the postures of those who had met violent deaths-a veritable chamber of horrors39 (Fig. 13). Shini-ech (literally "death pictures"), commemorative ukiyoe prints of celebrated actors issued upon their demise, became the rage. Such prints often showed the actor appearing as a ghost or descending into hell. Popular broadsheets reported all manner of preternatural events and phenomena as if they were actual items of news.40 The flippant necrophilia of the times is underscored by the appearance of the the great master of supernatural drama, Tsuruya Nambokuc? (1755-1829), on the kabuki stage in his own coffin. A special genre of ghost tale, the kaidan banashi,ci was purveyed both in vaudeville theaters and in private residences. Hayashiya Shozock was the most celebrated of such raconteurs.i4l The "Hundred Tales" (Hyaku monogatariCl) became an institution. Participants would gather by the light of one hundred candles and regale each other with ghost stories. At the conclusion of each tale, one candle would be extinguished until the room was plunged into darkness. A charming rendition by Kuniyoshi's pupil Kawanabe Gyosaic" (1831-89, Fig. 14) depicts a family settling in under a quilt for an evening of pleasurable horror. In trying to reconstruct how the vast array of supernatural beings was perceived by the Edo audience, we would do well to keep in mind at least three factors that impart special complexity to the endeavor: 1) the relation between the intensity of a given belief and the frequency with which it appears in art; 2) conventions of linguistic usage, and 3) evolution of imagery over time. First, the intensity of belief in certain subjects is not always mirrored in the frequency of their depiction. Hell scenes, for example, numerous during the Kamakura period (1185-1333) when religious evangelism was at a peak, became a rarity in Edo-period art. Their numerical de-</page><page sequence="8">12 MELINDA TAKEUCHI cline, however, does not indicate a corresponding diminution in the belief in hell. On the contrary, the rural imagination continued to burn brightly with notions of diabolical underworlds; populist preachers dilated upon the subject with consider- able efficacy. It was upon being taken to hear one such terrifying disquisition as a young child in the countryside, for example, that Hakuin Ekakucn (1685-1768), the great Zen prelate, decided to become a monk.42 Rather than attribute the de- creased production of hell scenes in the Edo pe- riod to lack of serious belief in the subject, rea- sons might be sought in the general reduction of the production of orthodox Buddhist paintings. The plethora of demons and ghosts in nineteenth- century Japanese art, by the same token, does not in itself comprise prima facie evidence for a widespread belief in the supernatural. Second, supernatural imagery was part of every- day parlance employed metaphorically in Japan and China. The Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting, a seventeenth century Chinese wood- block printed book that gained currency in Japan in the eighteenth century, for example, cautions budding painters not to allow "demons to gain control of the tip of one's brush."43 This is an an- cient concept in China that goes back at least as far as the Han period to the writings of Huainan- zig" (d. 122 B.c.).44 Such conventions persist in the spoken Japanese language today. When, af- ter suffering injury to one's face, one is said to look like Oiwa, the disfigured ghost-heroine in the kabuki play (Fig. 12), it cannot be presumed that the speaker believes in ghosts. The third point in understanding the reception of the supernatural in nineteenth-century thought is the change in attitudes towards given imagery over time. Oni, the horned demons who wreak havoc on earth as well as administ-ering various tortures in the Buddhist underworld, for exam- ple, were considered truly terrifying during the heyday of orthodox Buddhism. By the nineteenth century, however, they appeared in comical roles including gymnasts, meditating monks, debauch- ers in the Yoshiwara brothel district, and adver- tisers of stomach-ache medicine.45 As the Edo townsmen became more sophisticated and cyni- cal, they became less credulous. Records of su- pernatural hoaxes perpetrated on the public in- dicate that in the tough-minded atmosphere of nineteenth-century urban life, as opposed to the rural environment from which Hakuin sprang, manipulation of the supernatural for profit by Kuniyoshi and his contemporaries may have con- tributed to a fundamentally pragmatic attitude to- wards it. One might call to mind the incident wherein the illustrious Hiraga GennaicP (1729- 79) and the storyteller Utei Embaq (1743-1822) painted a magical formula (nembutsuCr) on a black calf and exhibited it as a supernatural portent.46 The carnival side-show atmosphere that often ac- companied the Edo-period experience of the su- pernatural no doubt brought about a certain de- gree of de-mystification. There was at the least, however, one agency about whose reception of the supernatural there is no doubt: the officials of the Tokugawa shogu- nate. This class promoted Chinese Confucian- ism, which held unflinchingly that since the super- natural was unknowable, people would do better to focus their attention on matters of this world. Echoes of such sentiments can be found in gov- ernmental proclamations. Officials of the govern- ment claimed the right to curtail any activity po- tentially deleterious to public morals, and exces- sive pleasure in supernatural themes evidently fell under this rubric. In 1808 a proclamation was is- sued banning stories about "flying heads, animal goblins, serpent monsters, fire demons, and ac- counts of the atrocities and manners of vicious women."47 When we consider the traditional an- imosity between the government and the towns- men, it is tempting to think that the shogunate's official disapproval of interest in the supernatural may well have been a major factor in the spread of its popularity. Thus we see that the implications of the su- pernatural in nineteenth-century Japan quite ex- ceed the modern Western notions of the word "supernatural"48 as "existing or occurring out- side the normal experience or knowledge of man." The Meaning and Reception of Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider Few art historians have written about Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider; those who do simply mention in passing that it represents a satire on the Tempo Reformscs of 1841-43.49 No one has made a comprehensive study of the style, iconog- raphy, intentions of the artist, or the issue of the relationship between artists, satire, and censor- ship at the end of the Edo period. The fullest investigations into Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider have been carried out by the historian Minami Kazuo,ct in a Japanese historical journal,</page><page sequence="9">DEMONS AND PROTEST IN LATE TOKUGAWA JAPAN 13 and Suzuki Juzoa u a retired librarian.50 By com- bining the fruits of their labors with the other kinds of evidence we have just investigated- biographical, stylistic, and iconographic-we can proceed with a fuller reconstruction of the mean- ing and reception of this remarkable legacy of Edo townsman culture. The triptych was released during the Tempocs Reforms. These measures, instigated under the senior councillor Mizuno Tadakunicv (1794- 1851), were devised in response to a widespread series of domestic crises precipitated by a conflu- ence of crop failures, natural disasters, rural un- rest, and economic imbalance.5' In characteristic Confucian fashion, Tadakuni tried to restore eco- nomic order by invoking moral order. He insti- tuted a campaign of austerity and frugality. Samu- rai in particular were warned off luxuries. Sump- tuary laws were enforced with a vengeance. Since in Confucian terms the raison d'etre of the Edo townsman was to purvey to the needs of the ruling class, when the samurai cut back on their demand for goods and services, the townsman economy suffered deeply. Many townspeople were forced to return to the countryside. Prices were fixed, merchant associations abolished, debts cancelled, and production of luxury items curtailed. En- tertainments were contravened; even depictions of actors, prostitutes, and geisha were forbidden. Kuniyoshi himself was fined for violating this pro- scription by including hidden portraits of actors in a street scene.52 As a final indignity, shopkeep- ers were forced to donate money to shogunal cof- fers. The population at large deeply resented the Tempo Reforms. There is no documentary evidence definitively establishing the meaning Kuniyoshi intended for his images in Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spi- der. Prior to the release of the triptych, how- ever, precedent had been established for the as- sociation of the subject of Raiko with Mizuno Tadakuni, the author of the reforms. An ear- lier, although undated, illustration in a puppet- play book had already showed one of Raiko's four retainers with the lagoon crest of Mizuno on his sleeve. 53 Precedent also existed for the use of the mo- tif of the spider in his web as a metaphor for Tokugawa rule, as a hanging scroll by Ukita Ikkeicw (1795-1859) suggests (Fig. 15). This del- icately beautiful, innocent-looking nature study is entitled The Web of Government. Ikkei was an artist of the Revivalist Yamato-e movement (Fukhk yamato-ecx), a group which sought to oust the Tokugawa regime and restore the emperor to power.54 In addition to the subject of the spider, the draughtsmanship of the demons also supports the suggestion that Kuniyoshi intended the work as a satire. As we have seen in the portrait of Oboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio (Fig. 4), Kuniyoshi was ca- pable of keenly observed naturalism. At about the same time that he designed Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider, he depicted a number of yokai monsters in extremely realistic fashion, in- cluding the dramatic Takiyasha the Witch and the Skeleton Specter (Fig. 16). Although Kuniyoshi took liberties in fabricating this anatomical as- semblage, the attempt at convincing drawing sug- gests that Kuniyoshi may even have consulted the sort of Western anatomy books that had be- gun to influence Japanese artists in the late eigh- teenth and nineteenth centuries.55 His demons in Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider, in contrast, are drawn with a sketchy boldness common to ef- fective satirists from Honore Daumier (1808-79) in France to the modern Chinese political car- toonist Feng Zikaicy (1898-1975). When we consider all the evidence, there are many points in favor of the argument that Kuniyoshi himself intended Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider as a work of satire, particularly in view of the timing of the release of the triptych. Kuniyoshi had a feisty disposition, and he himself had suffered under the Tempo Reforms. He had already showed a penchant for playful parodies of the world around him (Fig. 5). The style of drawing certainly lends itself to the interpretation of caricature. The depiction of contemporary events under the guise of historical legend had a long precedent in the Edo period as a device to escape political reprisal. Public attitudes towards the supernatural were highly charged: people employed it pragmatically, the images had lost the philosophical meanings they once had, and the awareness that the subject was frowned upon by the government no doubt added to its piquancy. It is likely that the puzzlingly complex iconographical scheme was devised to make identifications of specific demons with specific contemporary people or groups more difficult.56 Whether or not Kuniyoshi himself intended Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider as a satire on the Tempo Reforms, there is no question that his contemporaries interpreted the triptych that way. Three anonymous contemporary diaries, the Fujiokaya nikki,,z Terpo zakki da and Ukiyo</page><page sequence="10">14 MELINDA TAKEUCHI no arisamadb chronicled the public reception of Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider.57 As soon as the triptych reached the printseller's shelves, it touched off a stir. The Fujiokaya nikki referred to the work as a rebus or picture-puzzle (hanji mono dc). The game of linking specific demons with specific individuals or groups became such a source of amusement to the populace that officials of the government became concerned. The soporific figure of Raiko was interpreted by one unidentified source, appropriately enough, as the impotent shogun Ieyoshi;dd in the Fujiokaya nikki Raiko is cryptically identified as a certain "bigshot" (oyadama de). The retainer second from right playing go was thought to be Mizuno Tadakuni. The demons were seen as the various unfortunates, primarily townsmen, to whom the reforms brought hardship, or, alternatively, as officials of the Edo government. The Temp6 zakki dwelt at length upon towns- people's interpretation of the various demons as particular victims of the reforms. It is difficult to detect the rationale, if any, behind the iden- tifications. The Edo rage for punning seems to have been a primary consideration; and many of the characters were linked to specific popu- lar heroes about whom nothing is now known. The elephant (z6df in Japanese, Fig. 2-20), for example, was identified with "Nanzoin Zojoji.dg" Zojo-ji was one of the shogunal mortuary tem- ples; Nanzoin might be the name of a prominent individual at or in the neighborhood of Zojoji.58 The guiding principle of the assigned meaning was probably the play on the homophone zo. The "toothless" (ha no naki, Fig. 2-5), a play on the word hanashi,dh "story," became linked with Edo's famous vaudevillian storytellers (like Hayashiya Shozo), whose business was severely disrupted by the reforms. The sparrow (Fig. 2-12) was interpreted as referring to dancers (because of the sparrow dance?), whose performances had been curtailed; the three-eyed Fukurokuju (a sym- bol of wealth, Fig. 2-10) was seen as suggest- ing moneylenders, stockholders, and landlords. The wooden fish (used in temples to summon priests, Fig. 2-2) was linked to religious associa- tions. Interpretations of other creatures are more obscure: the "flying head" (Fig. 2-8) was identi- fied with women and children, the nine-skulled banner (Fig. 2-4) with houses of prostitution, the catfish (Fig. 2-28) with restaurants, the oni demon (Fig. 2-1) with lacquer shops, and the kappa (Fig. 2-27) with "pretty people and actors" (which probably means actor-prostitutes). The lantern- demon (Fig. 2-16) was equated with the "four- handed palanquin," which, of course, since it re- quired the luxury of two more bearers than the two-handed kind, had become a forbidden form of conspicuous consumption. It is curious that the spider was not mentioned at all. Neither Kuniyoshi nor the publisher Ibayadi expected or welcomed such a flood of attention. There were various accounts of the consequences: one version of the story indicated that Kuniyoshi and the publisher were called in and grilled by the authorities, but somehow managed to establish their innocence. According to the Fujiokaya nikki, the publisher voluntarily agreed to take back the blocks, and thus he and Kuniyoshi escaped punishment. But it was too late. Editions of the work circulated as far as Osaka and Kyoto, where according to Ukiyo no arisama, two thousand copies were sold in each city. Kuniyoshi and Ibaya were fortunate to have been let off so lightly. Variant versions of Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider appeared, and the parties responsible were punished with varying degrees of severity. According to the Fujiokaya nikki, Gountei Sadahidedi (1807-73) produced a picture book as well as a triptych on the subject of Raiko; the latter sold for thirty-six coppers (mondk). Sadahide designed another trip- tych, which sold for one hundred mon. Both the publisher and Sadahide were arrested, fined, and confined to handcuffs for twenty days. Utagawa Yoshitoradl (act. ca. 1850-80) created a set of twelve small-sized prints depicting Raiko. In this case the publisher and distributor were arrested, fined, and handcuffed. Yoshitora escaped with only a fine.59 An anonymous poster (banzukedm) treating the Raiko/Earth Spider/Hundred De- mon theme appeared in 1851.6O Censorship, which had gradually become lax (the original edi- tion of Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider had no censor's seal), was tightened. As time elapsed, the furor subsided. In 1855 Kuniyoshi himself issued another illustration of Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider (Fig. 17). This one lacked the demons but bore a censor's seal. The motif had passed quietly into public domain. Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider and Social Protest by Late Tokugawa Artists Seen in the context of its times, Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider represents part of a widespread ventilation in late Tokugawa times of dissatisfaction with social ills. Once one begins</page><page sequence="11">DEMONS AND PROTEST IN LATE TOKUGAWA JAPAN 15 looking, one finds a proliferation of visual ma- terial dating from this epoch that can be inter- preted as a critical commentary on contemporary society. This surprising fact runs counter to com- mon modern perceptions of the Tokugawa gov- ernment's legendary ruthless regulation of the ac- tions and attitudes of the citizenry. The dreaded shogunal network of spies was a familiar reality of daily life, as was the system of collective responsi- bility whereby an entire neighborhood would be punished (or even an entire extended family ex- ecuted) for the misdeed of a single individual. An illustration from a woodblock book banned during the Tokugawa period shows the various punishments meted out to those unlucky enough to run afoul of government regulations (Fig. 18). Clockwise from the upper right are depicted: parading miscreants through the streets for pub- lic humiliation; handcuffs (a popular-and one might imagine, effective-punishment for artists); beating; confiscation of estate; decapitation; and exile. The government's heavy-handed (if in- termittent) censorship of ukiyoe prints and kabuki plays was but one of the manifestations of this ab- solutist regime's regulation of artistic activity. Yet the government seems at times to have been re- markably permissive. The laws were enforced just laxly enough to give artists courage to flout them. In the fifth month of 1804, for example, the government ruled it illegal for townspeople to depict any Japanese military leader since 1573, which included all the Tokugawa shoguns and Toyotomi Hideyoshidf (1537-98), whose hege- mony had been usurped by the Tokugawa; the great Utamaro released a relatively innocuous triptych showing Hideyoshi viewing flowers and was promptly imprisoned.6' Utagawa Yoshitora drew an even more defiant satire, which showed the deified founder of the Tokugawa regime, Tokugawa Ieyasudo (Fig. 19) as a usurper, ex- ploiting for his own ends the fruits of the labors of his predecessors Oda NobunagadP (1534-82), Akechi Mitsuhidedq (d. 1582), and Toyotomi Hideyoshi-an illustration of the popular saying that Nobunaga pounded the rice, Hideyoshi made the cake, and leyasu simply sat back and ate it. The inscription, a seventeen-syllable haiku, seems innocent enough: Kimi ga yo o Tsukikatametari Haru no mochi Pounding rice For the glorious reign of our sovereign- Spring mochi (rice cakes) The poem implies that leyasu is eating the emperor's cake. The title in the cartouche, moreover, refers to samurai who have "stepped outside the Way." Yoshitora and the publisher were fined and spent fifty days in handcuffs,62 but, as we saw above, this contretemps did not deter Yoshitora later from taking advantage of the notoriety generated by Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider. The rewards of social satire evidently outweighed the punishments. Yoshitora's print represents a relatively rare and extremely blatant form of political satire; many other artists indulged in more discreet forms of social comment. An untitled page from volume twelve of the famous printed sketch- books (mangadr) by Katsushika Hokusaids offers a trenchantly-observed commentary on the hierar- chical nature of Tokugawa-period social relation- ships (Fig. 20). This whimsical slice of daily life presents a noble samurai camping beatifically in an outhouse, while the retainers required respect- fully to attend his every need wait upwind nearby and hold their noses in disgust. Another assault on samurai dignity was produced by Watanabe Nangakudt (1767-1813). This artist painted a pair of six-fold screens showing frogs aping the grand procession of a feudal lord.63 Although this would fall into the category of "playful painting" (giga), it also crossed the border into ridicule. There is no record of Hokusai or Nangaku be- ing punished. Artisans who did run afoul of the officials, like Utamaro, Kuniyoshi, Sadahide and Yoshitora, were fined and humiliated, but were frequently released to become repeat offenders. Indeed, poking fun at the samurai class seems to have been a pastime widely tolerated in Tokugawa society, as witnessed by the plethora of satirical humorous works of popular fiction (gesakudu) such as Portrait of a Feudal Lord (Daimyo-katagidv) by no less a luminary than the councillor Matsudaira Sadanobudw (1758-1820), in which a feudal lord was ridiculed for his excessive attention first to the civil arts and then to the military. The Bumpkin Daimyo Infatuated with Comic Theater, (Ky6gen-zuki yabo daimy6dx) took this kind of satire yet a step further.64 The ongoing popularity of works like the Suikoden stemmed, no doubt, from the tone of its assessment of the ruling class. "Those big-hat officials are the cause of all the trouble in this world,"65 proclaimed one of the heroes, leaving no doubt where the author's sympathies lay. Artists higher up the social scale than Hokusai and Nangaku also criticized society, but with</page><page sequence="12">16 MELINDA TAKEUCHI very different results. Among the samurai, the distinguished patriot, scholar, and painter Watanabe Kazandy (1793-1841) dared to object to the shogunate's policy of national seclusion and paid with his life: he was confined to house arrest for several years and then forced to commit suicide. Members of the Revivalist Yamato-e movement, which sought to restore the power of the emperor also were subject to serious reprisals.66 Ukita Ikkei's Web of Government, (Fig. 15), was produced in this milieu. A painter in Ikkei's circle, the courtier Reizei (or Okada) Tamechikadz (1823-64), was driven into exile for his political activities. He proved so miserably inept at intrigue (thus jeopardizing his own cause) that he was actually assassinated by someone on his own side.67 It is very clear that a distinction was drawn between the probably wholesome ventilation of the kind of discontent considered endemic to the city-dweller's lot, on the one hand, and protests leading to the undermining of the actual political system itself, on the other. Conclusion Looking at the theme of Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider in the broad context of East Asian art, we find that the triptych takes its place in a venerable tradition of using creatures from the other world to point up the ills of this one. The use of demonic imagery for so- cial satire has an ancient pedigree in China and Japan. Because Zhong Kui expelled demons, the late thirteenth-century Chinese handscroll, Zhong Kui's Night Excursion (Fig. 5), has been interpreted as a metaphor for ridding China of the Mongols.68 The Japanese handscroll Tale of the Tengu (Fig. 21), by coincidence also a late thirteenth-century work, showed these bird- headed supernatural creatures satirizing the an- tics of corrupt priests. In the section reproduced here the tengu parody the descent of the Bud- dha of the Western Paradise. The artist implied that monks have become so arrogant they have usurped the functions of the very gods them- selves. To pursue the subject of social protest in the Edo period to its logical conclusion, it is natural to inquire whether works like Minamoto Raiko and the Earth Spider actually contributed to the downfall of the Tokugawa regime in 1868. The answer to that question is most likely negative, for it is abundantly clear that townspeople like Kuniyoshi possessed no political influence whatsoever.69 Nor was it likely that they ever conceived of any system other than that of samurai-farmer-artisan-merchant.70 The study of objects like Minamoto Raik6 and the Earth Spider documenting social protest by artists in late Tokugawa, however, does provide a window directly into the milieu of the vital popular culture of the day. Such works often turn out to be rich repositories of ancient folklore, history, legend, and iconography. They reveal the Edo townsman's fascination with the past, as well as his plucky refusal to submit to the fetters of the present. And they illuminate universal problems concerning the relationship between artist, satire, and censorship.</page><page sequence="13">DEMONS AND PROTEST IN LATE TOKUGAWA JAPAN 17 Notes The number of colleagues who provided logistical and conceptual help in the preparation of this study is legion, and I would like to thank them all: Henry Smith, Karen Brock, Aileen Gatten, Steve Addiss, Pat Fister, Patricia Graham, Susan Matisoff, James Wagner, Roger Keyes, Peter Duus, and Richard Edwards. I owe a very special debt of gratitude for the trenchant suggestions of Carolyn Wheelwright, Christine Guth, and Gloria Newhouse. This material was first presented as a paper at "The Fantantic in Japanese Art and Literature," a symposium sponsored by the Japan Institute, Harvard University, in May 1985. 1. Tokyo National Museum, Tokubetsu ten: Ukiyoe-kyuishoho korekushion o chuishin ni, Tokyo, 1984. The prints with supernatural themes include one by Kuniyoshi, Kiyohime, from the series Passionate Heroes and Heroines (no. 488), and three by the Meiji artist Taiso Yoshitoshi (1839-92), Taira Koremochi Conquering a Demoness at Togakushi-yama (no. 663), Watanabe no Tsuna Cutting off the Demon's Arm at Rashomon Gate (no. 665), and Phantom Thief Hakamadare Yasusuke in Competition with Kido Maru for Magical Power (no. 667). The disregard of bizarre or fantastic subject matter by most modern Japanese art historians is due to two primary causes. One is the correspondingly low rank of such subjects in the inherited Chinese scheme, a system dominated by the rationalistic values of the Confucian literatus. Lothar Ledderose, in "Subject Matter in Early Chinese Painting Criticism," Oriental Art, n. s., v. 19, no. 1, Spring 1973, provides a chronicle of the sinking status of this area of pictorial subject matter. He points out that while the category of demons and ghosts (gui- shen) appears in the Tang-period Lidai minghua ji, the classification goes back considerably further (p. 70). By the Sung dynasty Xuanhe huapu, however, the category of gui-shen was relegated to the lower ranks of religious painting, which itself occupied a fairly low status in the eyes of the scholar-gentleman (who came to dominate the field of art criticism). The second cause of the disparagement of supernatural imagery is a legacy of the Meiji "enlightenment," which sought to downplay the irrational elements within Japanese culture. 2. In addition to the symposium on "The Fantastic in Japanese Art and Literature" at Harvard in 1985, an exhibition was organized by Stephen Addiss entitled Japanese Ghosts and Demons (catalogue New York, and the Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1985, cited as Japanese Ghosts and Demons). In this catalogue Prof. Addiss and his students set forth typologies of and introductions to some basic categories of Japanese supernatural imagery. Another ground-breaking study, which by its very nature included considerable amounts of material on the Japanese supernatural was the research conference on Nara ehon (Nara picture-books illustrating popular tales) organized in 1978-79 by Barbara Ruch, a specialist in Japanese literature, which included Japanese and American scholars. The findings were published in Nara ehon Kokusai kenkyukai, ed., Zaigai Nara ehon, Tokyo, 1978, and Nara ehon kokusai kenkyukai, ed., Kaigai shoz6 Nara ehon, Tokyo, 1979. 3. Raiko and the Earth Spider consists of three oban-sized polychrome sheets (measuring a total of 38 x 75 cm.). Each sheet bears the artist's signature (Ichiyasai Kuniyoshi ga) and the seal of the publisher Ibaya, who was active from the decade of 1810 to the 1850s. There is no censor's seal. 4.

Suzuki discusses the same issue in The Decadents, pp. 47-48 and quotes Hirose Rokuzaemon: "He [Kuniyoshi] was of such a wild, unbridled disposition that even his relatives turned their backs on him." 6. The Mumei-o zuihitsu is attributed to Keisai Eisen (1790- 1848), one of whose alternate names was Mumei-o. The work is also known as Ukiyoe ruiko, one of several versions. The first Ukiyoe ruiko by Ota Nampo was written ca. 1790. Subsequent versions (sometimes called Zoku ukiyoe ruiko) appeared in 1800 by Sasaya Kuninori; in 1802 by Santo Kyoden; ca. 1820 by Shikitei Samba; and 1844 by Saito Gesshin. The version of the Mumei-6 zuihitsu used here is transcribed in v. 3 of Enseki jishu, Tokyo, 1979, pp. 265- 320. The section on Kuniyoshi appears on p. 310. 7. Shui hu zhuan became popular during the Edo period and had been illustrated previously by Hokusai. It has been translated into English by Pearl Buck as All Men Are Brothers, New York, 1937; by J. H.

Thayer III, "Tattoos," Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan, Tokyo, 1983 (cited as Encyclopedia of Japan), v. 7, pp. 350-351. Thayer's statement that "tattoos are almost unknown among the Chinese" (p. 350), however, needs to be examined. One of the very first characters we encounter in the Shui hu zhuan, for example, was tattooed with nine dragons; certainly it was the Japanese perception that Chinese strongmen sported tattoos. 12. Ichikawa Masanori, ed., Zusetsu de miru Edo minzoku shi, Tokyo, 1972, p. 67. This book also reproduces diagrams of different kinds of Edo-period tattoos. 13. See, for example, Kobayashi, ed., Edo kaiga, p. 67. To drive the point about nineteenth-century prints home with maximum force, the author provided the characters tai- haiteki (decadent) with the furigana reading "dekadansu." See also Richard Lane, Images from the Floating World: The Japanese Print, New York, 1978, p. 190, for a standard English-language litany: "Figure design in ukiyoe of the nineteenth century was often a confused combination of superficial realism and escapist fantasy, a period of deca- dence and of decline in much of Japanese art." The ori- gins and application of the concept of decadence in ukiyoe are the subject of an unpublished seminar report in 1985 by Gloria Newhouse, whose stimulating ideas I wish to acknowledge here. Ms. Newhouse and I have begun pre- liminary work on an extended collaborative study of the subject. 14. Examples of Kuniyoshi's depictions of grafitti, entitled Scribbles on a Storehouse Wall, are to be found in The Raymond A. Bidwell Collection, nos. 157 and 158, and in Ukiyoe hakka, p1. 46. 15.

A long list of Chinese paintings of Zhong Kui is given in Stephen Little, "The Demon Queller and the Art of Qui Ying (Ch'iu Ying)," Artibus Asiae, v. 46, no. 1/2, 1985, pp. 23-40. 19.

In addition to the Hyakki yagyo handscroll in Shinjuan attributed to Tosa Mitsunobu, which is an Important Cultural Property, there is a related version of this work painted by Sumiyoshi Jokei in 1829 in the Tokyo National Museum, and another, anonymous version is owned by the Tokyo National Museum. Another anonymous handscroll in the Tokyo National Museum entitled Fusoshin emaki, thought to be a copy of a Muromachi work, treats the motif of tools or utensils turning into kami, or divinities, upon reaching the age of one hundred. All are reproduced and discussed in Komatsu, "Hyakki yagyo," pp. 126-137. Komatsu questions the traditional ascription of the first three works as depicting the Night Parade. For a reproduction of yet another version of the Hundred Demons attributed to Reizei (or Okada) Tamechika (1823- 64) in the Spencer Collection, New York Public Library, see Miyeko Murase, Tales of Japan: Scrolls and Prints from the New York Public Library, New York and Oxford, 1986 (cited as Tales of Japan), no. 29. This work closely copies the Shinjuan version; the artist, however, has included portions of a text, whose origin is unknown, and rearranged the order of the scenes to follow it. The text treats the story of a young man of the late twelfth century who has been terrified by the appearance of the hundred demons at night in an ancient mansion. 21.

A tomb tile from Sichuan dating to the Later Han dynasty (25-220 A.D.), for example, shows Xiwangmu, seated on her dragon-and-tiger throne, watching a performance of a dancing toad. See Stories from China's Past: Han Dynasty Pictorial Tomb Reliefs and Archaeological Objects from Sichuan Province, People's Republic of China, San Francisco, 1987, pl. 63 and its description by Wu Hung, p. 167. Wu states that in this context the toad symbolizes the moon (and presumably Xiwangmu's control over natural phenomena). 26. Haku Sampei, ed., Obake zue, Tokyo, 1974, p. 185.

The character mono is the Chinese wu, a concept of reification charged with meaning, particularly in Sung thought. I am indebted to Richard Edwards for calling this notion to my attention and providing me with a copy of his "The Real World: Style and the Object (Wu) in Late Sung Painting," in Jongyang yenzhou yuan, Taipei, 1981, pp. 37-72. 29.

Ian Buruma in his popular but provocative Behind the Mask, New York and Scarborough, Ontario, 1984, p. 14 and pp. 192-94 suggests that the eruption of sadistic, bizarre, or grotesque themes in the late Edo period resulted from the tension between imported Confucian morality imposed by the shogunate and the earthy (to say nothing of frequently obscene), hedonistic, often violent, death-preoccupied strain of native Shinto (as reflected in the creation myths), in popular culture. In Buruma's words, "The harder the official pressure is, the more grotesque the manifestations of popular culture become" (p. 14). One sees evidence of the momentum of supernatural imagery building up in the eighteenth century: it was the age of Ueda Akinari's (1734-1809) celebrated ghost stories; and the age Tsuga Tensho (1718-ca. 1794) wrote A Garland of Heroes (Hanabusa soshi), derived from Ming collections of ghost stories and recast into Kamakura and Muromachi settings. For information about eighteenth-century ghost stories see Donald Keene, World Within Walls: Japanese Literature of the Pre-Modern Era, 1600-1867, New York, 1976, pp. 376- 77 and 379-81. Toriyama Sekien (1712-88), the teacher of Utamaro, produced a woodblock book of the Hundred Demons, parts of which are reproduced in Haku Sampei, ed., Ukiyoe no yvurei, Tokyo, 1974, pp. 25, 27, and 31. 37. Three of Luo Ping's depictions of supernatural imagery are found in Tsuruta Takeyoshi, ed., Y6shuf hakkai, v. 11 of Suiboku bijutsu taikei, Tokyo, 1975, fig. 102-04. 38.

Ibid. p. 518 and pp. 520-52 1. 40. Some of the more unlikely of these include an enormous, man-eating centipede that appeared out of the ocean, a fifteen-year-old girl named Osato who spontaneously grew a penis, a tengu which appeared from the clouds to threaten a foreigner who tried to climb Mt. Fuji, and the haunting of a man by the ghosts of his murdered wife and mistress. I was introduced to this material by my colleague Peter Duus. For reproductions of these broadsheets (called kawaraban) see Kawaraban shimbun, Edo Meiji sambyaku jiken I: Osaka natsu no jin kara goshozeniya Gohei no saigo, Taiyo, February, 1978, and Kawaraban, shimbun, Edo Meiji sambyaku jiken II: Kurobune raik6 kara Toba Fushimi no tatakai, Taiy6, May 1978. 41.

A recitation of the horrible descriptions of these various hells is given by Hakuin in his Orategama III; the Red Lotus Hell, for example, is so-named for the color of the sores its inhabitants exhibit on their bodies. See Philip B. Yampolsky, trans., The Zen Master Hakuin: Selected Writings, New York and London, 1971, pp. 115-16. 43.

Prof. Edwards called my attention to the notion that this concept evidently was a metaphor for the artist's bringing order to the phenomenal world and banishing chaos (symbolized by demons). 45. Images of oni as gymnasts, meditating monks, and de- bauchers are reproduced in Stephen Addiss, ed., Japanese Ghosts and Demons, fig. 53, 52, and 39 respectively. A shop sign in the form of an oni advertising stomach medicine is found in Mildred Friedman, ed., Tokyo: Form and Spirit, Minneapolis, 1986, p. 92. The shop sign is of Meiji date, but it clearly follows Edo conventions. 46. Markus, "Carnival of Edo," p. 516.</page><page sequence="16">20 MELINDA TAKEUCHI 47. Terrence Barrow, PhD., in "Ghosts, Ghost-Gods, and Demons of Japan," in Nicholas Kiej's, Japanese Grotes- queries, Rutland, 1973, p. 18. It is difficult to assess the scholarly credibility of this clearly popular book, which lacks a bibliography. Even if the quotation is apocryphal, however, the Confucian anti-supernatural philosophical stance still stands. Stories of vicious women were partic- ularly popular in Japanese folklore. Women were associ- ated with all manner of sinister supernatural transforma- tions of animals both in China and in Japan. One has but to recall the story of Kiyohime, whose lustful love of the monk Anchin resulted in her transformation into a mon- strous serpent, who trapped and roasted the object of her affections under a giant temple bell. A Chinese story of a cruel woman who was really a fox in female guise con- cerned the notorious Shang concubine Dafei. This story was quite popular in the Edo period. Hokusai depicted it in his Manga, v. 10, reproduced in The Metropolitan Mu- seum of Art Bulletin, v. 42, no. 1, Summer 1985, p. 29. For Kuniyoshi's rather violent Japanese version of the story see B. W. Robinson, Warrior Prints, pl. 4. 48. As defined in Webster's New Universal Unabridged Dictionary, Cleveland and New York, 1974 edition. 49. A typical explanation is found in the Springfield Museum of Art's exhibition catalogue Utagawa Kuniyoshi. The entire entry for the triptych (no. 114, unpaged) reads: "At left is Usui Sadamitsu; at the go-board in the center are Sakata no Kintoku (red face) and Watanabe no Tsuna; compare no. 200. This print was surpressed as a satire of the government." 50. Minami, "Minamoto Raiko," pp. 119-26. Minami ac- knowledges the assistance of Mr. Suzuki, who twelve years later published the relevant parts of his findings in his "Kuniyoshi-tasai kibatsu na gagyo," in Ukiyoe hyakka, v. 7, p. 132. 51. For a scholarly study of the Tempo Reforms see Tsuda Hideo, Tempo kaikaku, Tokyo, 1975. 52. Minami, "Minamoto Raiko," p. 124. Kuniyoshi was fined three kan. 53. Minami, "Minamoto Raiko," p. 120. Minami unfortu- nately does not give the name of the play or any further information about the book. 54. Tsuji Nobuo has written a substantive article on this artist, "Ukita Ikkei to sono daihyo saku 'konkai soshi emaki' ni tsuite," in Tsuji Nobuo, ed., Bunjinga, shoha, v. 6 of Zaigai Nihon no shiho, Tokyo, 1980, pp. 111-17. I am grateful to Carolyn Wheelwright for this reference. 55.

This suggestion was also put forth by the celebrated belle lettrist Ishii Kendo (1865-1943), whose remarkable life spans the Tokugawa to Showa (1926-present) periods. See Minami, "Minamoto Raiko," p. 121. Ishii also tried his hand at matching the demons with specific people or groups of the time in his later work Tempo kaikaku kitan, cited in Minami, pp. 120-22. 57. To avoid cluttering what follows with an inordinate num- ber of footnotes, I acknowledge here that all references from these diaries which describe public and official reac- tion are taken from Minami, "Minamoto Raiko," passim. 58. An enigmatic reference appears in a different context in the Fujiokaya nikki to a "ghost of a puppet-play prostitute hairdresser ... of Sakaimachi in front of Nanzoin-do" (Minami, "Minamoto Raiko," p. 119). It is possible that the two references to Nanzoin concern this departed individual. 59. Yoshitora was fined three kan. Because the value of money fluctuated so widely, it is difficult to know precisely what these figures mean. A mon, or momme, was worth 3.75 grams of silver; a kan equalled approximately 1000 momme. A fine of three kan, therefore, was not inconsequential. 60. Hayashiya Tatsusaburo, Bakumatsu bunka no kenkyfi, Tokyo, 1978, pp. 203 discusses the poster and the fact that it was inspired by Kuniyoshi's triptych. 61. Miyatake Gaikotsu, Hikka-shi, Tokyo, 1911, p. 118. A reproduction of Utamaro's triptych appears facing p. 100. 62. Shimizu Isao, Edo no manga, Tokyo, 1981, p. 28. I am indebted to Professor Peter Duus for these references. Both Shimizu and Miyatake, Hikka-shi, p. 118, give a date of 1837 (Tempo 8) for this print, which pushes Yoshitora's accepted period of activity back by over ten years. 63. Reproduced in Yamato Bunkakan shozohin zuhan mokuroku 2: kaiga, shoseki, Nara, 1974, no. 81. The work almost certainly was inspired by the twelfth-century Animal Frolic Scrolls. 64.

It is difficult to find the right nuance for the word yabo; the closest might be the Yiddish "klutz." In Edo slang, the yabo was the butt of ridicule for his pathetic attempts to cut a fine figure in the racy world of the "greenhouses" (brothels). 65.

Conrad Totman's magisterial study The Collapse of the Tokugawa Bakufu, 1862-68, Honolulu, 1980, for example, delves deeply into the circumstances that brought this lengthy chapter of Japanese history to its end. Although TFotman concentrates primarily on circumstances within the samurai class itself, financial difficulties, and pressures exerted by the intrusion of foreign powers, he does not even mention discontent among the townspeople among the elaborate factors leading to the demise of the system. For further reading on peasant protest in Japan, see Anne Walthall's (rather misleadingly titled) Social Protest and Popular Culture in Eighteenth-century Japan, The Association for Asian Studies Monograph no. 42, Tucson, Arizona, 1986. 70. Masao Maruyama, Studies in the Intellectual History of Tokugawa Japan, Mikiso Hane, trans., Princeton and Tokyo, 1974, p. 189 and 249, claims that among all surviving records of Tokugawa philosophy, there was only one thinker, Ando Shoeki (act. mid. eighteenth century), who actually opposed the idea of the feudal system itself. Needless to say, Shoeki's writings were supressed during his own times, and have come to light only in the twentieth century. The four-class system was seen as the earthly manifestation of the heavenly order, and the Tokugawa populace apparently accepted such thinking without question. In the words of Hayashi Razan (1583- 1657), the first Confucian advisor to the shogunate, "It accords with the proper rules of heaven and earth that heaven is above and earth below. Man is born with the proper rules of heaven and earth in his heart, so there is rank (high and low) and order (first and last) ... When the [distance between] high and low is not violated, and noble and base are not confused, human ethics are in order. When ethics are in order, the state is well governed" (ibid., p. 200).
