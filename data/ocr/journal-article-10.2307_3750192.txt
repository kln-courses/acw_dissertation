<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Eternal Thou T. E. BURKE 'Every particular Thou is a glimpse through to the eternal Thou; by means of every particular Thou the primary word addresses the eternal Thou ... the Thou that by its nature cannot become It."' At first sight, Buber is concerned, in I and Thou, with nothing more strange and esoteric than our human capacity for communication, for speaking not just about but to, or with certain elements in our world. Doubtless there is much of interest that can be, and has been, said about this capacity, about its phenomenology, for example, or the theoretical or practical problems it creates. But if Buber has anything new to con- tribute in any of these fields, why should he not, like many others before and since, present and argue his theses in the exact, unemotional and grammatically orthodox idiom of the ordinary textbook or research paper? Why the famous 'poetic prose' or why, more specifically, the character- istic liberties with conventional syntax, like the use of the definite and indefinite articles before 'Thou' and 'It'? Why not 'the person (or, on rare occasions, the thing) we address as "Thou" ', or 'the thing we refer to as "It", ' or 'the person we treat as such a thing'? Or why, in the passage quoted above, '. . . the primary word addresses. . .' rather than simply . . in speaking the primary word we address . .'? Examples of syntactical oddity could be quoted from almost every page of I and Thou. And it is useful to try the experiment of replacing some of them by these more orthodox rephrasings, simply because, when we do so, we soon realize that such replacements would seriously obscure the central point that Buber is making. Consider the characteristic passage where he says 'The Thou meets me through grace-it is not found by seeking. . .' and, a few sentences later, 'The relation to the Thou is direct. No system of ideas, no foreknowledge and no fancy intervene between I and Thou' (p. i i). Suppose we were to substitute 'The person I address as Thou meets me through grace. . .', etc. We should then be saying some- thing which Buber does not want to say, and could not accept as true. What I identify as some specific person among others, identify by such things as location, appearance, occupation, habits, etc., is, in his view, 1 Martin Buber, I and Thou, translated by R.G. Smith, (Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark, 1937), 75. All quotations, unless otherwise stated, are from this work. Philosophy 54 1979 7I</page><page sequence="2">T. E. Burke ipso facto no longer for me Thou but merely It. By thus identifying, I alter my relationship with that which I address, and it is just not true to say, of what is thus identified, that it is met through grace, in Buber's sense. For essentially the same reason, it will not do to say 'The relation to the person I call Thou is direct..., etc.' Again, when I identify someone as this person, distinguished from the mass by features like those just mentioned, then a system of ideas and foreknowledge, in the relevant senses, does intervene. In short, our 'more orthodox rephrasings' would not enable us to say the same things as Buber says, in less eccentric language. In adopting them we necessarily adopt also a way of identifying our subject-matter which is quite alien to Buber's intentions, and which has the effect of making us, quite literally, talk about something different, something of which his assertions do not, and could not, hold. More generally, to ask Buber to adopt our 'text-book' idiom would be to ask much more of him than merely that he should abandon flowery or metaphorical language in favour of something more literal or technical. When we adopt a certain idiom, in this sense, we also, even if unwittingly, adopt a certain role in relation to our subject-matter, and hence assign a certain corresponding role to it. Thus, to adopt the 'text-book' idiom is to take up a standpoint outside and independent of our subject-matter, to survey it ab extra, and to keep the initiative, in our enquiries and discourse about it, firmly in our own hands. We subdivide it, identify its elements, explore and pronounce judgment on its characteristics, in accordance with our scheme of concepts, our interests, our techniques of enquiry, our criteria of success and failure therein . .. (which may recall Kant's famous analogy, i.e. we approach it, not '. . . in the character of a pupil, who listens to all that his master chooses to tell him, but in that of a judge, who compels the witnesses to reply to those questions which he himself thinks fit to propose'2). The subject matter may thwart us in various ways or make things difficult for us, but, while we sustain this role, it is never permitted to judge us-even when the subject matter in question is humanity or some part of it. We may criticize or correct ourselves, but the responsibility and the initiative still rest with us. Our text-books and research papers are presumably the end-products of some of the more sustained and systematic of such initiatives, of such identi- fying, examining, judging, etc. And we need not for a moment question that they contain much that is of the greatest interest and value from many points of view, much indeed that is virtually indispensable for life as we know it. But to adopt such a role, and to make something correspondingly a subject-matter in the way just indicated, is to create what is essentially, 2 Critique of Pure Reason, translated by J. M. D. Meiklejohn (London: Bell &amp; Sons, i908), xxvii. 72</page><page sequence="3">The Eternal Thou in Buber's term, an I-It relationship. And the end-products of such relationships, whatever their value, cannot, by their very nature, elucidate the I-Thou relationship, simply because we do not enter into I-Thou relationships with things thus identified and characterized. The Thou relates to us in an altogether different way. But before we try any further to bring out the contrast between the two relationships, it is important to note how we have been forced straightaway into something like Buber's own idiom when we try to focus on I-Thou. As I suggested at the outset, we are concerned, from some standpoint, with the everyday phenomena of communication; but our fundamental difficulty is that, when we pass from the second person to the third, from simply talking to, or with, each other, to talking about talking to or with each other, we are immedi- ately under great-if not irresistible-pressure to alter radically the whole situation, to adopt in effect the standpoint of I-It, and hence to abandon the essential terms of the initial relationship and substitute others-and, as a result, inevitably produce a distorted picture of it. Buber's distinctive idiom can be seen as, at least in part, an attempt to adapt our linguistic resources to avoid, or minimize, such distortion-an attempt, whether wholly successful or not, to find a means of drawing back from the relation- ship and contemplating it, without dissolving or reforming it. Hence, to return to the most obvious example, his reluctance to refer to the terms of the relationship by anything other than simply 'I' and 'Thou', though it is instructive to note how he is sometimes forced to do so, as the price of intelligibility, and, indeed, how we were forced to do so a few sentences back-'It is identified .., etc., in which we were constrained to use 'it' to refer to the Thou. Of course, Buber can-and does-also bring out the distinctive charac- ter of the I-Thou relationship by pursuing a negative path, i.e. by contrast- ing it with the I-It relationship, the characterization of which, by its very nature, puts no such strain on our linguistic resources. And, to go back to our own characterization of an I-It relationship, we can certainly convey something important about I-Thou by saying that, by contrast, in this relationship we do not identify the other elements involved but leave them free to identify themselves, answer questions formed by others and listen to their answers to ours instead of merely sitting in judgment, forgo the last word, and accept, with due humility, reactions to, and criticisms of, what we say ... And so on. Buber himself elaborates many such points of contrast with great sensi- tivity and perceptiveness. And most of us, I should think, find that most of these ring sufficiently true to the experiences and encounters of actual life to evoke quite readily the response which philosophers are character- istically seeking-Yes, that is how it is, though I have never before put it into words, or, at least, into these words. Indeed our main reservation may well be that he is often over-dramatic, and inclined to over-stress what are, 73</page><page sequence="4">T. E. Burke after all, fairly commonplace differences. But such reservations are, I think, indicative of the danger of simply concentrating on such easily drawn and appreciated contrasts-we may get the impression that Buber is doing nothing more than calling attention to different possible relationships between the same relata. But there are some key passages at the very outset of I and Thou which suggest that he is after something much more funda- mental, that for him the relata are not independent of the relationships, and cannot preserve their identity unaltered in either of them indifferently. And hence he has to find the means of contrasting not just the different relationships, but also the different relata which they require. Now, as Professor H. D. Lewis has pointed out, he raises some serious difficulties if he claims that the self simply exists in certain relations, and is nothing apart from these.3 And such assertions as 'There is no I taken in itself, but only the I of the primary word I-Thou and the I of the primary word I-It. When a man says I he refers to one or other of these' (p.4) give rise to obvious objections. For example, if I claim to have entered into relationships of both kinds-and presumably, as a condition of discussing them in this way, I must-am I not in effect claiming to preserve a single identity, to have been, quite simply, the same I, in both? However much we insist on the extent and importance of the changes we undergo on passing from one relationship to the other, it would seem that we must still allow a certain irreducible identity-in-difference. Arguably, however, the passage just quoted, and even the earlier 'For the I of the primary word I-Thou is a different I from that of the primary word I-It' (p.3) do not altogether rule this out. And we should notice in this connection the further saying that 'The primary word I-Thou can only be spoken with the whole being. The primary word I-It can never be spoken with the whole being' (p.3). What is interesting here is the sugges- tion that the I of the I-It relationship is a part of the I of the I-Thou relationship. While keeping in mind the pitfalls in so doing, we might per- haps make ourselves a kind of model, or moving picture, of the situation- the I, in entering an I-It relationship, retreating to the periphery of its world, to a point where it can survey that world ab extra with a minimum of participation in it (something reminiscent of the Wittgensteinian 'sub- ject' which 'does not belong to the world but it is a limit of the world'4). It withdraws into its ultimate fastness, the minimal area in which it can still survive. By contrast, in entering an I-Thou relationship, it ipso facto comes forward into the world to interact on an equal footing with other elements thereof. 3 The Elusive Mind (London: Macmillan, i969), 262ff. 4 Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, I933 edition), 5.632. 74</page><page sequence="5">The Eternal Thou Just how helpful such retreat-and-advance, ebb-and-flow images are, or to what extent they do justice to what Buber says about 'the whole being', are open to question. But it is worth noting that he himself uses a similar image somewhat later in the book: 'Shrunk from substance and fullness to a functional point, to a subject which experiences and uses, I approaches and takes possession of all It . .. the man who says I-It stands before things, but not over against them in the flow of mutual action. . .' (p.29). And certainly, in so far as we restrict ourselves to the roles of detached observers or commentators or manipulators of things, we are taking up only a part of the full range of characteristically human roles in the world, and to this extent at least, it is quite appropriate to speak of a retreat, or shrinking, from wholeness. (' . . . without It man cannot live. But he who lives with It alone is not a man' (p.34)). And if this difference is what, essentially, Buber is trying to elucidate, rather than a difference between two distinct I's, which have no existence outside their respective relationships and cannot pass from the one relationship to the other, then the bulk of what he has to say seems, at the least, no longer intolerably paradoxical. So far as the other element in such relationships is concerned, he would seem to be saying here also that we can have both I-It and I-Thou relation- ships with the same thing: 'The tree is now no longer It' (p.7); ' . . . this is the exalted melancholy of our fate, that every Thou in our world must become an It' (p.i6); 'The It is the eternal chrysalis, the Thou the eternal butterfly...' (p.I7). It is a matter of change or becoming, rather than vanishing or replacement. The change in question, of course, is a change of role in relation to the I. As the role of the I changes so, correspondingly, does the role of that with which it is concerned-and, ipso facto, a new relationship comes into being.5 Confusion arises if we demand an unqualified Yes or No answer to such questions as 'Is the I of this I-Thou relationship the same as the I of that I-It relationship?' or 'Is the Thou of this relationship the same as the It of that?' There are no absolute standards of sameness and difference;6 what we count as the same or different varies with our purpose or our standpoint. Within an I-Thou relationship as such we do not identify the Thou as a particular It familiar from former I-It relationships. But when we stand outside the various relationships that make up our life history-stand, in effect, in an I-It relationship to all of them, though perhaps, like Buber, striving to avoid distorting the distinctive character of I-Thou-then we 5 Cf. in this connection, Buber's remarks on artistic creation, pp. 9f. 6 Cf. Wittgenstein's comments on 'the same', e.g. in Philosophical Investi- gations, Part I, 2I5ff., and the developments of these by George Pitcher in 'About the Same', Ludwig Wittgenstein: Philosophy and Language, ed. by Ambrose and Lazerowitz (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, I972), I21ff.; and Peter Winch, The Idea of a Social Science (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, I958), 27ff. 75</page><page sequence="6">T. E. Burke may, on any of an indefinite variety of grounds, judge that the It of one relationship and the Thou of another or the I of one and the I of another, were one and the same. We can rapidly and readily withdraw from con- versation with someone into possible observations of, or reflections about, him, and then perhaps re-enter the conversation again. And there is plenty in the common setting and circumstances of all these relationships which we should count as sufficient grounds-count, that is, if and when we come to reflect on the whole sequence-for identifying the Thou of some with the He, or It, of others. II What, then, are the essential differences between approaching someone- granted now that the one is justifiable-as Thou and approaching him as It. To begin with, this must be separated from another, related distinction, that between intrinsic and instrumental valuing: If I face a human being as my Thou and say the primary word I-Thou to him, he is not a thing among things ... with no neighbour, and whole, in himself, he is Thou and fills the heavens. This does not mean that nothing exists except himself. But all else lives in his light (p.8). From this and many other passages it seems clear enough that to treat someone as Thou at least includes treating him as having intrinsic value. (Indeed the last sentence of the quotation suggests that, momentarily at any rate, we treat him as the only thing intrinsically valuable.) But the idea of treating someone as intrinsically valuable-and even that of treating everything else as valuable only in so far as it serves, or enhances, this one-cannot, by itself, do justice to that reciprocity, or sharing of initiat- ive, which is characteristic of I-Thou relationships. Such valuing is, essenti- ally, a one-way relationship, constituted by our actions, our attitudes, our feelings towards the valued, whose role in the relationship can be a passive or indifferent one. We may want to say that we recognize the value; we do not confer it. But, even so, the response, the actual valuing, is still essentially and entirely ours. And it is worth recalling how, in assessments ab extra of such relationships, the valuer is often considered morally superior to the valued because of the selflessness of his devotion-where, for example, he has met very exacting demands for service or sacrifice on behalf of the valued-or, alternatively, pitied because of his lonely obsession. But we could not properly speak of an I-Thou relationship where there is merely a solitary or self-negating devotion. There must also be a response from the Thou, a direction of his attention back towards ourselves-and outwards towards our shared concerns. For the Thou is not only valued, in an I-Thou relationship, but shares in valuing, as indeed was implied in what 76</page><page sequence="7">The Eternal Thou we said earlier about the sharing of initiative. Whether the relevant matters are trivial or important, he is, in effect, invited to take part in determining what is to be the focus of attention, what goals or objectives are to be pur- sued in relation to it, what is to count as success or failure . .. The I is no longer solely responsible for conferring (or recognizing) value; he has admitted a co-worker on terms of equality, to share the responsibility and the effort. All this requires considerable adaptation if we are to claim, with Buber, that it is possible to have I-Thou relationships, which are not mere anthro- pomorphic fancies, with non-human nature. But it is possible, given due sympathy and imagination, to see how some element in such nature might have the role in someone's life, not just of something observed, classi- fied and used, or even of something cherished for its own sake, but of something which intervenes, whether he wills it or not, to determine, in part at least, what he values, and hence what he does, in the world. We might take for instance the role of the lakes and the hills for the youthful Wordsworth; or Buber's own examples (pp. i8ff.) of the power-often, we should note, a sinister and frightening power-of nature in the life of primitive man. And in such situations it is certainly not too fanciful to detect something, at least, of the surrendering of initiative, the letting of values and objectives be determined for us, which is characteristic of I-Thou. It is necessary also to separate treating someone as It from treating him purely as a material thing, and treating him as Thou from allowing that he is in part an immaterial, or spiritual, being. The difference between the two primary words is not a difference in ontological standpoint-a differ- ence as to what there is or is not in the world. Whatever Buber means, it is not that the world is furnished with two distinct kinds of entity, Its and Thous, such that we might take account of the one and overlook the the other. The Thou 'is not a thing among things, and does not consist of things', nor '. . .a specific point in space and time within the net of the world; nor is he a nature to be experienced and described, a loose bundle of named qualities' (p. 8). The Thou is not then simply a complex material body; but we should get no closer to its essential character by supposing that it is, or is also, an immaterial soul. There is plenty of history to show how easy it is to adopt an uncom- promisingly dualistic view of man, and still treat men as It, things to be observed, judged, organized, arranged for, provided for.. .without willingness to give them any active role in the making of the relationship. Even when we talk specifically about human souls, and show perhaps quite genuine concern for their well-being, we can still in this way speak the primary word I-It. It is, however, interesting to note how speaking thus pushes us towards reifying souls, talking of them in effect-whether in accordance with our overt theory or not-as simply another kind of thing, 77</page><page sequence="8">T. E. Burke minimally differentiated from bodies. ('Inner things or outer things, what are they but things and things!' (p. 5).) If, then, it is possible to adopt a dualistic view of man and still treat him as It, is it also possible to adopt a purely materialistic view and still treat him as Thou? We can best answer this by pointing out that the question of whether we regard a human being as nothing but a complex material struc- ture, or as a complex material structure plus something else, arises only when we speak the primary word I-It in relation to him. It is then meaning- ful to ask as what kind of thing among things we regard him, what quali- ties we ascribe to him, etc.-and then that we might meaningfully be said to adopt, or reject, a materialistic view of man. When we address him as Thou the question of what kind of thing we take him to be does not arise; for here we are not thinking of him, or treating him, as anything, as instan- tiating this concept or that. We are not, as Buber points out, even thinking of him as him-but simply as Thou. The important point to be realized is that the issue between dualism and materialism arises within the speaking of the primary word I-It, and is irrelevant to the distinction between I-It and I-Thou. It may help to bring out the real distinction between the two if we look at the kind of situation in which the possibility of an I-Thou relationship exists but is rejected in favour of I-It. Take, as an obvious example, a situation in which a doctor in the presence of his patient does not speak, or speaks only perfunctorily, to the patient, but speaks at length about him to colleagues or nurses. The doctor and his team may well show great interest in the patient's state and spare no pains to understand it; they may do everything within their power to cure his physical (or, for that matter, mental or spiritual) ills. We may even suppose a mission-hospital or field- hospital situation in which they have put themselves to considerable risks and discomforts to do so, out of quite genuine desire to alleviate suffering. And yet, clearly, no amount of such attention will obviate the patient's feeling that, as is so often said, he is being treated as a case, or a thing, rather than a human being. According to Buber, to enter into I-It relation- ships only is to be less than a man; similarly to deny someone the oppor- tunity of entering into an I-Thou relationship is, to that extent, to deny him his humanity. And in these terms we can understand how being talked about in one's presence, however gentle or concerned or approving the talk may be, can seem insulting-indeed the ultimate in insults-in a way that being spoken to, however sternly or accusingly, cannot. Thus, it is hardly an exaggeration to say that someone who quarrels with us or accuses us may succeed in realizing an I-Thou relationship, while someone who risks his life trying to save our bodies or our souls may fail: '. . . the man who straightforwardly hates is nearer to relation than the man without hate and love' (p. i6). It is an interesting possibility, also, though one that we cannot explore here, that some of the deepest divisions within a society are between 78</page><page sequence="9">The Eternal Thou groups whose members are prepared to enter into I-Thou relationships (to share the initiative, the valuing, etc.) with each other, but not with those outside their own group. III A commonplace observation on I and Thou is that it habitually employs the characteristic language of religious faith, of the exploration and culti- vation of man's relationships with God, to what are, primarily, relation- ships between human beings, or, more rarely, between human beings and elements of their natural environment. More specifically, Buber seems to talk of his I-Thou relationships in terms it has been customary to apply to distinctively 'religious', or 'mystical' experiences-for example, as given through grace, as somehow outside the framework of space, time and causality, as glimpses through to the eternal. And it might well be supposed that it is with such experiences that Buber is essentially concerned. Yet to think in this way is to invite a variety of misunderstandings. In the first place, as we have already emphasized, it is a mistake to talk of I-Thou and I-It as if they were alternative relationships either of which could be said to hold between, say, one human being and another, or be- tween a human being and a tree or an animal. To introduce these classi- fications is not simply to make a preliminary move neutral between both relationships, but to have adopted already the standpoint of I-It. Hence to say that Buber is applying religious language to relations between human beings is in itself to come dangerously close to misinterpreting him. Further, to contrast our relationships with God and our relationships with our fellow men and with nature is to envisage a reality divided into elements (nature, man and God) each distinguished by its own particular range of qualities and relationships, each a possible subject-matter for enquiry, something to be talked about. And this is to adopt once more the standpoint of I-It. And if we divide the religious from the secular by reference to such a contrast, or pick out 'religious' experiences as being in some way experi- ences of God, as contrasted with experiences of our human or natural environment, then this, whatever merits it may have, is something quite different from the contrast of I-Thou and I-It. The Thou is not something experienced at all, (pp. 9, ii), i.e. is not one particular object or content of experience among others; and hence to think of our relationships with the Thou as religious, or quasi-religious, experiences in this sense is simply to miss Buber's point. In this connection, it is well to remind ourselves of Buber's clearly expressed distrust of mysticism, at least as popularly understood. For example, having spoken of the situation in which I and Thou are allegedly absorbed into a single totality he goes on: 79</page><page sequence="10">T. E. Burke Humanity, which just before confronted the godhead, is merged in it- glorification, deification, and singleness of being have appeared. But when the man, illuminated and exhausted, falls back into the cares of earthly affairs, and with knowledge in his heart thinks of the two situ- ations, is he not bound to find that his being is split asunder and one part given to perdition? What does it help my soul that it can be drawn anew from this world here into unity, when this world itself has of necessity no part in the unity-what does all 'enjoyment of God' profit a life that is rent in two? If that abundantly rich heavenly moment has nothing to do with my poor earthly moment-what has it to do with me, who have to live, in all seriousness still to live, on earth? (p. 86f). Or, on a more personal level, in Between Man and Man,7 after an account of an episode in which, he tells us, his 'religious enthusiasm' blinded him, with tragic consequences, to the real needs of someone who sought his help: Since then I have given up the 'religious' which is nothing but the exception, extraction, exaltation, ecstasy; or it has given me up. I possess nothing but the everyday out of which I am never taken. The mystery is no longer disclosed, it has escaped or it has made its dwelling here where everything happens as it happens. But, in fairness, it must be pointed out that the great mystics, of the Judaeo-Christian tradition at least, were not generally concerned with strange experiences, 'exaltations and ecstasies', for their own sake. Many of them would seem to have shared Buber's distrust of such things, and to have regarded them simply as incidentals, deserving no more than a guarded welcome, to the real concerns of the religious life. Thus, according to St John of the Cross, all '. . . visions, revelations, heavenly feelings ... are not worth the least act of humility . .. that charity which neither values nor seeks itself, which thinketh well, not of self, but of others . . The ideal of the religious life was thus a total 'detachment', or absence of self-interest, which was content to serve God in the world, simply out of love for God, and to ask, not only for no material reward, but for no special favours in the way of visions or revelations either. Any specific feeling, or sense, of unity with God was valued only as a manifestation of a unity of wills. And, in essence, this standpoint would, I think have been endorsed by most of his fellow mystics, and indeed by our Judaeo- Christian religious tradition in general. And this element of mysticism, and religion generally, is an example par excellence of what we have found to be central to Buber's I-Thou relationship-the willingness sometimes to surrender initiative and control to another, to be addressed, to listen, to let one's aims and values and 7 Translated by R. G. Smith (London: Kegan Paul, 1947), 14. 80</page><page sequence="11">The Eternal Thou ideas be challenged and overturned ... Buber indeed has more to say about what it is to be I in a relation to a Thou than about being Thou in a relation to an I. But the relationship is reciprocal; by its very nature, every I is at least potentially also Thou. And for the religious believer being Thou is as essential as, and in one sense prior to, being I. It is obvious, on even a slight acquaintance with the literature of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, that much more characteristic than any straining after vision or ecstasy, or after any exalted spiritual or moral condition of oneself, is the conviction of being looked on, addressed, summoned, by another. The Good Shepherd, who comes in search of his lost sheep, the Lord who visits his people, or calls his servants and sends them out to do his bidding . .. these are the characteristic images. The believer has always identified himself with the sheep that was lost and then found, or with the servant chosen for a mission. His supplication is 'Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth', his greatest blessing that 'the word of the Lord should come unto him'. And he acknowledges that, but for his Lord's search and calling, he himself would be altogether helpless. It may be said, and quite understandably, that such total humility and submissiveness takes us a long way beyond the sharing and reciprocity we have spoken of. The religious believer's relationship with his Lord may indeed be an I-Thou relationship, but it must be allowed that it is very different from all other such, since one of the participants is so immeasur- ably superior to the other in every respect that even the analogies of Lord and servant, or shepherd and sheep, fail to do justice to the gulf between them. And Buber himself suggests a unique relationship when, for example, he speaks not just of the Thou, but the eternal Thou, or claims that this, and apparently this alone 'can by its nature not become It' (p. II2). (Though, on this last point, we notice again how the exigencies of discuss- ing the matter at all leave Buber, and us, with a somewhat precarious hold on self-consistency.) But can we set this relationship apart from all others by emphasizing the superiority of one of its participants? Superiority must presumably be superiority in respect of some qualities or characteristics; we are implying that this participant is one among a plurality of beings or entities with a common range of qualities, but distinguished by having these to an im- measurably higher degree. But does this not take us back into the world of It? On the basis of Buber's teaching we cannot think of God at all as another entity or being additional to human beings and the various elements of nature-no matter how we try to distinguish IHim from these (although, like Buber himself, we are sometimes pushed into speaking as if we did). We can talk quite meaningfully about Buber's idea or con- ception of God-granted that these terms are flexible enough to cover his thinking of God as that which can only be Thou and never It, that which is glimpsed through every particular Thou, etc. But to have such a conception 6 8i</page><page sequence="12">T. E. Burke is not to suppose that there is, or could be, any one entity which instanti- ates it; indeed it is the distinctive nature of this conception that it rules out such instantiation. To stay faithful to Buber's central thought, we have to say what, for the religious believer, makes one I-Thou relationship unique, without straying into the language or the standpoint of I-It, i.e. without attempting to characterize its participants ab extra, even where such characterization heaps unlimited honours on one of them. We cannot say simply that it is unique because it is a relationship with a being having a unique range of qualities. That a man can speak with God, or for God, but not about God is an idea that has a long history. But there can be various reasons for saying so. And the reason which concerns us here is not that God differs so much from every other subject-matter that all our conceptual equipment, devel- oped primarily for use in other fields, can only be hopelessly inadequate and misleading in this. The objection is to regarding God as a subject- matter for enquiry, identification or characterization at all. It is worth- while to recall here what we said in the previous section about the element of discourtesy, or slighting, inherent in treating anyone as It in his presence, regardless of what is said about him, and to remember how the believer thinks of himself as standing, and speaking, always in the sight and hearing of God. The ways in which this is put are no doubt often somewhat naively anthropomorphic, but the essential point remains. As in the human case there is an implicit denial of humanity, so here, if we discourse objectively to each other about God, there is an implicit denial of Godhead; we cannot, by the very nature of the situation we have created, be paying more than lip-service to the idea of the Living Presence. Defiance might acknowledge that presence where some kinds of theologizing might not. To bring out the unique significance for the religious believer of one I-Thou relationship, it is best to start by acknowledging the rarity of any relationship fully deserving to be called I-Thou in Buber's sense. It is to be hoped that we can all recollect encounters in which we have come close enough to it, or it has come close enough to us, to make what Buber is saying comprehensible. But, almost always, the realization is a very brief and imperfect one; for most of us, Buber is explicating a recognizable potentiality of our relations with our fellow-men or with nature, rather than a commonly realized feature of them. Thus we can see, 'through a glass, darkly', what he has in mind when he says that the Thou 'fills the heavens' and 'all else lives in his light' (p. 8), or that the primary word I-Thou .... can only be spoken with the whole being. He who gives himself to it may withhold nothing of himself' (p. io). But how often, in all honesty, could we claim to find such phrases appropriate to describe actual en- counters of our own? It would be widely accepted that one thing at least which stands in the way of I-Thou relationships is our natural, and perhaps naturally ines- 82</page><page sequence="13">The Eternal Thou capable, preoccupation with our needs and interests as elements within the spatio-temporal order-the self-centredness which effectively prevents us, except in rare moments of self-forgetfulness, from allowing the presence of another to 'fill the heavens' for us, or from seeing 'all things in his light'. Doing so seems to be the privilege of those of us who can 'become as little children' to the extent of receiving, or recovering, the child's occasional capacity for giving someone, or something, open-minded, disinterested attention. We cannot will or discipline ourselves out of the inhibiting self-centred- ness; notoriously, any such exercise is self-defeating. There is no moral regimen by which we can render ourselves capable of, or worthy of, the relationship in question. Buber speaks of it as coming 'through grace' and not to be found by seeking. But it is here that the Christian reader, while agreeing in substance with what Buber says as far as he goes, would want to maintain that he has not enough to say about how and at what cost grace is brought, or brought back, into the world of men. Retaining Buber's distinctive terms, the Christian might add something as follows: Left to myself, I cannot meet another as Thou; for like the rest of humanity, I find myself enmeshed in the world of It. I can identify myself and my fellow-men only as elements of that world, each with his distinctive bundle of qualities, needs, interests, and preoccupations, and can see and respond to them only from my particular standpoint within it. Apart from this, there is only the elusive and disturbing sense of some other, wholly differ- ent possibility for human life. The chain of 'It and It again' is broken only when I am addressed, or called, as Thou, when for someone else I am 'not a thing among things'. And, for the Christian, the total selflessness, or, to adapt a phrase from the Beatitudes, the purity of heart, which can make this possible, came, or came back, into the world in the life of Jesus Christ. 'There was no other good enough' as the old evangelical hymn has it; and it is in His call to discipleship that grace is offered. Again, the Christian might go on to insist, this is not primarily a matter of being given favours or treated leniently, but rather of being offered citizenship of a 'kingdom not of this world', and a new identity as part of that kingdom, of being called on to adopt its standards of mutual care and responsibility. The equality, or 'reciprocity' of the I-Thou relationship, which seemed in danger of disappearing, is thus restored; we are invited to take it up again, even at this disconcertingly high level. And it is by responding to this calling, by acknowledging it as an invitation to where ultimately he belongs, or is at home, that man finds grace to speak, in his turn, 'the primary word I-Thou'. The Christian would presumably allow that there are many ways in which this calling is mediated, or claimed to be mediated, and that there are serious possibilities of self-deception. Hence the longstanding pre- occupation with the question of how the right to speak for, or in the name 83</page><page sequence="14">T. E. Burke of, Christ is transmitted down the generations. But, whatever the attendant dangers, there is undeniable force in his claims that religious life charac- teristically finds its source in this conviction (variously blissful or frighten- ing, sudden or slowly developing) of having by whatever means been singled out, made the focus of an undivided attention, individually sum- moned to a new kind of life; and that, in urging us to 'accept the call of Jesus' he is performing the all important function of pointing a definite way into the realm which Buber so strikingly describes. So one way at least in which this relationship is unique for the Christ- ian is that it thus provides the key to all other I-Thou relationships worthy of the name. Could he tell us any more, in Buber's terms, about how or why it does so? He might find Buber's most helpful contribution in this regard by going back to the saying 'The primary word I-Thou can only be spoken with the whole being' (p. 5) and especially to the idea of wholeness of being which we may characterize in part as the restoration of something which we recognize as essential to our being and yet, in this world, lost to us, i.e. the power to respond to things, not just as an element in the spatio-temporal order, with a standpoint determined by its identity within that order, might respond, but to respond to each in its own individuality (i.e. the 'detachment' of St John of the Cross, which is not the detachment of indifference, but rather of selflessness, the disinterested concern which springs from the minimizing of self-interest). And, for the Christian, wholeness of being, in this sense, is part at least of what he discovers in, and through, Jesus Christ. And the recognition of such wholeness-whether in the encounter with Jesus Himself, or, by His grace, in encounters with others-are the moments in his life history of which he might, most appropriately, use Buber's phrase, 'glimpses through to the eternal Thou'. Wholeness of being is not of course one particular being among others-but it is already sufficiently clear that the glimpse through to the eternal, whatever else it may be, cannot be envisaged as a glimpse through one particular to another, however they may be distin- guished. It would be equally mistaken to think of wholeness of being simply as a certain quality, or virtue, which a particular person (identified in the ways already mentioned, by appearance, occupation, etc.) may have or achieve, and the rest of us recognize, and, perhaps, resolve to emulate. For we cannot discover such wholeness in something or someone whose ident- ity is given by a particular place or role within spatio-temporal nature. What little we have said about it is still enough to make it clear that whole- ness is to be found only in something quite differently identified, as be- longing essentially to an eternal order, and to which the particular place in the spatio-temporal world is incidental. Wholeness, in this sense, is not something to be achieved, or added on, but something inescapably there, hidden or suppressed perhaps, but still not to be denied, and still providing the motivation for its own recognition and release. 84</page><page sequence="15">The Eternal Thou It helps to recall here the characteristic Christian claim that conversion is not simply a matter of adopting a new code of morals, or manner of life, but one of taking on a new identity, of being 'born again' or 'becoming a new creature in Christ'. When a Christian makes such a claim, we may suppose him to mean that the roles and relationships by which he identifies himself, the standpoint from which he makes his distinctive response to the world, have radically altered. And there is a corresponding alteration in that to which he responds. Such taking on of a new identity is not necessarily, or usually, a sudden or easy process; the annals of Christianity, right from the beginning, give many accounts of the struggle, often severe and protracted, and perhaps rarely wholly resolved, between the old self and the new. Why the struggle should be resolved specifically in Jesus Christ is something the Christian cannot explain (and any attempt to do so is liable to distort his essential relationship with Jesus Christ and replace it by one of I-It). He can only testify that, for him, here as nowhere else, it is resolved. And such resolution, the finding of one's true identity within the eternal rather than the temporal order, is at least in part what the Christian tradition has understood by the 'inheritance of eternal life'. In brief summary, then, the value of I and Thou for religious thought lies not only or primarily in the idea of God as 'the Thou that by its nature cannot become It', but in the way it can be used to illuminate the Chris- tian idea of grace, in terms of man's becoming Thou in relation to God; and of man's thereby achieving a new identity as one able in his turn 'to speak the primary word I-Thou'.
