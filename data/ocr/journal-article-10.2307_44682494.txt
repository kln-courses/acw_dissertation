George Zu Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Copyright © 2005 SAE International ABSTRACT We have developed a digital human model, called VIP- Man, from segmented and labeled Visible Human (Male) image set containing about 100 radio-sensitive organs and tissues (selected from 1400 anatomical structures). The voxel size is 0.33mm x 0.33mm x 1.0 mm and the whole-body contains about 3.7 billion voxels. The VIP- Man model has been coupled with various Monte Carlo codes to simulate occupational and medical scenarios. More recently, a preliminary study has developed a 4D version of the VIP-Man model to account for the motions of the heart and lungs. This paper discusses the past experience and future issues to be addressed including the extension of the existing model into multi-scale testbeds for deformable organ geometry modeling, medical imaging, radiation treatment planning, and virtual surgical simulations. INTRODUCTION A worker can be routinely or accidentally exposed to an internal and/or external ionizing radiation source as a result of radiological contamination. Similarly, a cancer patient is irradiated by intense ionizing radiation produced by a medical accelerator or radioactive seeds. Assessment of radiation doses for radiation protection purposes relies largely on a few sets of basic dosimetric quantities. For example, the fluence-to-dose-equivalent conversion factors for various organs are the basis for designing radiological facilities and for calculating dose to a worker/patient exposed to radiation external to the body (ICRU 1998). For assessing dose to target organs due to radionuclides internally deposited in the source organ(s) following an accidental intake or a nuclear medicine procedure, the specific absorbed fractions (SAFs) or the specific effective energies (SEEs) are used (Snyder 1978; ICRP 1979; ICRP 1990). The whole-body radiation cancer risk can then be assessed by using ICRP methodologies for effective dose or effective dose equivalent (ICRP 1990; USNRC 1991). The conversion factors and SAFs have been pre- determined using full-body human anatomical models and Monte Carlo calculations. Radiation treatment planning involving Monte Carlo simulation is performed using patient-specific images covering a portion of the body. These dosimetric tasks involve careful specification of the human body geometry and the irradiation conditions (radiation energy and direction etc). Radiation transport and energy deposition in the body are often calculated using a Monte Carlo code. It is apparent that the accuracy of these dosimetric quantities (and others derived from them) depends upon the modeling of the body, radiation environment, and Monte Carlo radiation transport. Recently, there has been a paradigm shift in the way human models are developed for radiation protection dosimetry. This paper summarizes the latest effort in the human modeling for radiation simulations. Computational models of the human body for radiation protection dosimetry have evolved into two types: 1) Equation-based stylized models, where organs are delineated by a combination of simple surface equations, and 2) Image-based tomographic models, in which organs are defined from segmented and labeled volume elements (voxels) from tomographic images of real individuals. 1. STYLIZED MODELS Early models representing the human body were mostly homogeneous slabs, cylinders, and spheres. The first heterogeneous anthropomorphic model was devised at Oak Ridge National Laboratory for the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) Committee of The Society of Nuclear Medicine (Snyder et al. 1969; Snyder et al. 1978). This model, known as MIRD Phantom, was based on the concept of the "Reference Man" for radiation protection purposes, although it was 779</page><page sequence="2">recognized that variation among individuals could be significant (ICRP 1975). Reference Man was originally defined as being a 20-30 year old Caucasian, weighing 70 kg and 170 cm in height. The original MIRD phantom was analytically described in three principal sections: an elliptical cylinder representing the arm, torso, and hips; a truncated elliptical cone representing the legs and feet; and an elliptical cylinder representing the head and neck. The mathematical descriptions of the organs were formulated based on descriptive and schematic materials from general anatomy references. The goal was to make the mathematical equations simple, thus minimizing computation time (Snyder et al. 1978; ICRP 1987; ICRP 1996). More than 40 organs and tissues were specified, with basically three media of distinct densities: bone, soft tissue, and lung. Later improvements at Oak Ridge National Laboratory have led to a "family" of models having both genders at various ages (Cristy and Eckerman 1987). Others have developed similar models known as the "Adam" and "Eva" (Kramer et al. 1982). One of the most recent improvements is a newly revised head and brain model (Bouchet et al. 1996). These MIRD-based models have served practically as the "standard" to radiation protection dosimetry community. Figure 1 shows exterior and cut-away views of the stylized models. Fig 1. Stylized adult male models showing (a) exterior view of the adult male, (b) skeleton and internal organs of the adult male/female, (c) surface equations representing stomach and Gl tract. The stylized mathematical descriptions of the organs were formulated based on descriptive and schematic materials from general anatomy references. The goal of this approach was to make the equations simple, thus minimizing computing time. For example, the stomach wall (the football shape in Fig. 1c) is defined as the volume between two concentric ellipsoids (Cristy and Eckerman 1987): / '2 / '2 Í '2 JzzZiLļ / '2 Í '2 &lt; ļ and I a J V J I c J / '2 Í '2 Í '2 [ / *-*o '2 i Azzh Í A '2 , i Í z~zQ '2 i &gt;ļ. Ka-d J 'b - d ) 'c-d j Several groups of researchers worldwide have used these MIRD-based stylized models extensively, with different Monte Carlo computer codes, to calculate internal and external organ doses for a variety of health physics applications involving photon, electron, neutron, and proton sources. For a comprehensive listing of papers and discussions, the readers are referred to ICRU Report 48 (1992) and ICRP Publication 74 (1996). For more than two decades, MIRD-based mathematical models allowed the radiation protection community to gain important insights into the distribution of organ doses that were difficult or impossible to study with physical phantoms. It is clear, however, that the human anatomy is too complex to be realistically modeled with a limited set of equations. As such, many anatomical details in the mathematical models had to be compromised. In spite of the effort to develop more complicated mathematical models, they remain simplified and crude. For instance, the skeleton in the stylized adult male model does not resemble a human, and the radiosensitive red bone marrow is not represented. Many researchers have begun to realize that today's computers are so powerful that it is technically no longer necessary to limit the geometry representation to overly simplified shapes. 2. TOMOGRAPHIC MODELS In the past decade, a new class of computational models has emerged with the advent of 3D tomographic imaging. These models contain large arrays of voxels that are identified in terms of tissue type (soft tissue, hard bone, air, etc) and unique organ identification (lungs, liver, skin, etc). 3-D medical imaging techniques, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), have advanced remarkably, allowing us to easily visualize the internal structures of the body and to store the images in versatile digital formats. In radiation treatment of cancer patients, Monte Carlo techniques are applied to patient CT images for patient-specific treatment planning (Hartmann et al. 1997). Compared to the tasks of treatment planning, however, radiation protection dosimetry is faced with the following unique challenges: 1) Full-body models are needed for most radiation protection applications, but medical images' are often taken for a portion of the body because CT procedures expose the patients to intense X-rays and MRI is time-consuming; 2) A large amount of internal organs/tissues have to be identified and segmented for organ dose calculations for radiation protection dosimetry, while, in radiotherapy, only the tumor and adjacent organs need to be specified; 3) The size of a full-body model can be potentially too big for computers and Monte Carlo codes to handle; and 4) Radiation protection dosimetry involves photons, electrons, neutrons, and protons, but the majority of the clinical radiotherapy procedures involve only photon/electron beams or seeds. Because of these challenges, only a few groups have successfully constructed image-based whole-body models. Tomographic images reveal patient internal structures accurately, but time-consuming segmentation and 780</page><page sequence="3">classification are necessary to implement the models for radiation transport calculations in a Monte Carlo code. To date, a number of major studies have reported whole-body tomographic models constructed with this approach (e.g., Zubal et al. 1994; Jones 1997; Hickman and Firpo 1997; Petoussi-Henß and Zankl 1998; Kramer et al. 2003; Lee et al. 2004; Nagaoka et al. 2004). MONTE CARLO METHODS Analytical calculations for the transport of the radiation through media can be performed only in very simple geometries and under severe approximations. Monte Carlo method, which is based on the first principles, provides the only practical way of performing accurate calculations of 3-D dose distributions from particle interactions in a complex target such as the human body. The earliest use of a Monte Carlo simulation technique was around 1873 (Hammersley and Handscomb 1964). The real development and application of the technique, however, stemmed from work on the atomic bomb during World War II by von Neumann, Ulam, and Fermi. Neumann coined the term "Monte Carlo" to reflect the idea that a conceptual roulette wheel could be employed to select the random nuclear processes. Today, a computer-generated random number between 0 and 1 is used for this purpose. The random number determines which interaction will occur by comparing probabilities (i.e., cross sections) of each interaction. The process is repeated and a particle is tracked in the target until it deposits all its energy or escapes. When a large number of particles (usually several millions) are studied this way, the results accurately predict the physical processes that may be experimentally determined. Validation of a code must be done before the code may be used for calculations. The widespread acceptance of computational models in radiation dosimetry was made possible by the availability of well-validated and maintained Monte Carlo codes and very fast personal computers since the late 1980s. Among all the Monte Carlo codes, there are four general purpose codes that have been widely used in the United States and elsewhere: 1) EGS4, originally developed at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, is well known for its detailed physics treatment involving electron-gamma showers (Nelson et al. 1985). Electron transport algorithms, such as the PRESTA, make EGS4 one of the most sophiciticated and efficient photon/electron code ever developed; 2) MCNP, originated from Los Alamos National Laboratory, has the capbility to transport photons, neutrons, and in the recent version 4B, also the electrons (Hendricks 1997). MCNP 4B has a generalized input capability allowing a user to model a variety of source and detector conditions without having to modify the source code itself. The "lattice structure" feature facilitates the definition of repeated "cells." However, MCNP is not as efficient as EGS4 in tracking particles in target that has very large amount of divided regions. 3) LAHET is a code for the transport and interaction of nucléons, pions, muons, light ions, and anti-nucleons in complex geometry (Prael and Lichtenstein 1989. The code handles geometry input and the tracking of the particles the same way as MCNP. For neutron interactions above a cutoff energy (20 MeV), the code uses Bertini and Isabel intranuclear cascade models to describe the nuclear interactions mechanism. If the energy falls below the cutoff, the particle transport needs to be performed by the models in MCNP which are based on ENDF/B cross section libraries. 4) MCNPX, released in 1999, is a newly merged code that combines the theoretical models of the LAHET Code System with the general features of the MCNP to provide a fully-coupled treatment of the transport problem (Hughes et al. 1997). The code, which is currently only available for UNIX platform, expands the capabilities of MCNP by increasing the set of transportable particles (such as protons). Experience with the beta version shows that MCNPX promises to be a very versatile Monte Carlo code. Together, these codes represent the state-of-the-art in terms of the radiation physics, cross-section data and physical models involving photons, electrons, neutrons, and protons. E-mail groups about these codes are: EGS4- L@mailbox.slac.stanford.edu, mcnp-forum@lanl.gov, lcs-forum@lanl.gov. The following section of this paper presents the development of a tomographic model, called VIP-Man, using images from National Library of Medicine's Visible Human Project®, and implementation of the model in various Monte Carlo codes for radiation protection and medical physics radiation dosimetry. MATERIALS AND METHODS THE VISIBLE HUMAN IMAGES The quality of original image data for constructing a whole-body model is crucial. At an early stage of our project, several unique sets of whole-body CT/MR/color photographic images from the National Library of Medicine's (NLM) Visible Human Project® (VHP) became available. The ambitious goal of the VHP, which was conceived in 1988 and initiated in 1991, was to build the most detailed digital image library about the anatomy of an adult male and an adult female. VHP is the result of a recommendation from the visionary NLM Board of Regents who foresaw an increasing demand for electronically represented images in clinical medicine and biomedical research (NLM 1990; Ackerman 1995). Cadavers that were considered "normal" and representative of a large population were evaluated. The donated body of a recently executed 38-year-old male from Texas was the first specimen to be selected for VHP. Later, a 58-year-old female was also obtained. To ensure the applicability, it was decided that the image data needed to be documented in several common 781</page><page sequence="4">formats used by radiologists and other physicians. Eventually, four modalities were used: traditional X-rays and CT scans to optimally visualize bone, MRI for soft tissue, and color photographs for definitive resolution. The color photographs, which had the finest resolution, were used to provide a standard for comparison. Generally, image format consists of many pixels (picture elements), as shown in Figure 2a, each representing a tissue volume in a 2-D plane. The 3-D volume of the tissue is called a voxel (volume element), and it is determined by multiplying the pixel size by the thickness of an image slice (Bushong 1997). Figure 2b shows the coronal views constructed from the transverse color images. Fig 2. (a) 3D voxels geometry; (b) Re- constructed color anatomical photographs of the Visible Human Male. Unlike mathematical whole-body models, an image- based model (also called voxel or tomographic model) contains a huge number of tiny cubes grouped to represent each anatomical structure. Transversal MRI images of the head and neck and longitudinal sections of the rest of the body were obtained at 4 mm intervals. The MRI images are in 256 x 256 pixel resolution. Each pixel has 12 bits of gray tone resolution. The voxel size for MRI data (torso portion) set is 1.88 mm x 1.88 mm x 4 mm. The CT data consists of transversal CT scans of the entire body taken at 1-mm intervals at a resolution of 512 pixels x 512 pixels where each pixel is made up of 12 bits of gray tone. The voxel size for the CT data set (torso portion) is 0.94 mm x 0.94 mm x 1 mm. The transversal anatomical photographs for both male and female cadavers are 2048 pixels by 1216 pixels where each pixel is defined by 24 bits of color. The anatomical photographs are at 1-mm thick slices for the male cadaver and 0.33-mm for the female. There are a total of 1871 slices CT and anatomical photographs (male), respectively. The transversal anatomical images were obtained by photographing the top surface of the body block after removal of (by shaving) each successive millimeter (0.33-mm for the female) by a cryomacrotome. These color photographic data set for whole-body has a voxel size of 0.33 mm x 0.33 mm x 1 mm for the male (0.33 mm x 0.33 mm x 0.33 mm for the female). Since the first public debut on November 28, 1994, VHP images have been available in public domain (www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/). Since then, computer engineers and anatomists, working together, have devoted unprecedented effort to classifying and visualizing the data sets. For many years, the Visible Human Male is by far the most complete computerized database of the human body ever assembled (Spitzer and Whitlock 1998). Since 1998, we have been working with the Visible Human color photographic images of the male to develop and apply a radiation dosimetry model called Visible Photographic Man, or VIP-Man (Xu et al. 2000). STEPS TO CONSTRUCT WHOLE-BODY MODEL In addition to adapting original VHP images, three more steps had to be completed to construct the VIP-Man model: 1) Identify and segment the organs or tissues from the original images; 2) Assign physical properties to organs or tissues; and 3) Implement the anatomical data into a Monte Carlo code. These steps are discussed in details next: The original color photographs for the male had been identified and segmented mostly by manual procedures to yield up to 1400 structures (Spitzer and Whitlock 1998). Organs or tissues adopted to construct VIP-Man include adrenals, bladder, esophagus, gall bladder, stomach mucosa, heart muscle, kidneys, large intestine, liver, lungs, pancreas, prostate, skeletal components, skin, small intestine, spleen, stomach, testes, thymus, thyroid, etc. Figure 3 shows 3D rendering of the whole body and detailed internal organs and the head/brain of the VIP-Man model. Fig 3. VIP-Man in 3-D views showing (a) whole-body skin and skeleton; (b) details of internal organs; (c) details of the head and brain. Visualization Toolkit was used in the surface rendering of the voxelized images (Schroeder et al., 1997). Additional automatic and manual imaging processing and segmentation were performed by this group to obtain gray matter, white matter, teeth, skull CSF, 782</page><page sequence="5">stomach mucosa, male breast, eye lenses, and red bone marrow. Traditional image processing techniques were employed to identify tissues based on color separation (for example, redness for red bone marrow). Gl track mucosa was realistically represented, except for stomach, where one voxel layer on the inner surface of the wall was used. The final list covers "critical" organs or tissues that have been assigned "tissue weighting factors" (ICRP 1990; USNRC 1991). Other organs or tissues are included because their potential roles in biomedical engineering applications. Once an organ or tissue has been segmented, the associated voxels could be arbitrarily colored for visualization. In comparison with the stylized models, the anatomical differences are strikingly obvious. As shown in Figure 4, major organs appear to have very different geometrical shapes and locations. Fig 4. The VIP-Man model has obviously different anatomical representation from the stylized model. Table 1 compares the organ masses of VIP-Man with the Reference Man by ICRP 23 (1975) and mathematical adult male model by Cristy and Eckerman (1987), all using very similar densities. At more than 103 kg, VIP-Man is fatty, having nearly 20 kg more in fat than the Reference Man. The major organs seem to have much more similar masses than the Reference Man. The body had slight increase in body volume after it was frozen, causing the weight also to increase. The height of VIP-Man is 186 cm, taller than the Reference Man, which has been recently modified to be 174 cm in height and 73 kg in mass (ICRP 1995). The major organs have fairly similar masses. Technically, VIP-Man can be easily re-scaled by a user if necessary, so that the height and total weight agree even better with the Reference Man. For engineering applications, organs or tissues of interest have to be related to appropriate physical properties. For radiation protection purposes, the average tissue compositions and densities recommended in ICRP 23 were used to tag each voxel in VIP-Man (ICRP 1975). This step allows the radiation interaction cross section library in a Monte Carlo code to be linked to each voxel for radiation transport simulations. Computers have limited amount of random accessible memory (RAM). Although today's technologies are much more advanced than a few year ago, the maximum "useable" RAM for a typical PC is often less than 1 GB, seemingly less than the size of VIP-Man containing a total of about 3.7 billion voxels and additional coding. A significant amount of effort was required to reduce the memory burden by using an innovative look-up table (LUT) algorithm. The LUT algorithm was successfully implemented in EGS4, allowing the computer to store only key anatomical and physical data; the details are unfolded from specific tables when needed. The memory saving with the LUT algorithm in VIP-Man/EGS4 is about a factor of 20. On a 450-MHz Pentium II PC of 512-MB RAM, VIP- Man/EGS4 can be run at the original 0.33 mm x 0.33 mm x 1 mm voxel size. This makes VIP-Man/EGS4 the finest model ever developed for Monte Carlo calculations. MCNP and MCNPX, on the other hand, were designed to be general-purpose codes, therefore, their default code options had to be changed to optimize memory. These improvements, however, were not enough, and as a result, the voxel size of VIP- Man/MCNP/X had to be compromised to 4 mm x 4 mm x 4 mm in order to run it on the same PC. Others have reportedly been able to handle a head model of 65 million voxels in MCNP4A using the ASCI Blue Mountain supercomputer (over 6000 Parallel CPUs from SGI) at Los Alamos National Laboratory (Grooley 1999; McKinney 1999). Therefore the original voxel size at 0.33-mm seems to be out of reach for foreseeable time. Although the resolution for VIP-Man/MCNP/X is limited by the current computer technologies, VIP-Man/MCNP/X is the first whole-body model ever constructed for neutron and proton dose calculations. Although the current running time is more than 10-hour due to the size of data, the detailed physics treatments in EGS4, MCNP4B, and MCNPX were not compromised in any way. All of our calculations are being performed on PCs operated under Linux environment, which is a complete operating system that is similar but not identical to UNIX. The parallel virtual machine (pvm) in Linux enabled us to use multiple CPUs for very time-consuming tasks. Compilers, such as g77, had to be used in EGS4 to accommodate the large integral format (Chao et al. 2001a). Since both EGS4 and MCNP4B transport photons and electrons, we were able to "validate" the modeling and Monte Carlo coding by making sure both codes give the śame results for VIP-Man (at identical voxel sizes at 4 mm x 4 mm x 4 mm resolution). Several breakthroughs on handling the huge image data were made during this study and the VIP-Man model has been successfully used to compute organ doses for radiation protection involving photons (Chao et al 2001a; Winslow et al. 2004a; Winslow et al. 2004b; Xu et al. 2005), electrons (Chao and Xu 2001; Chao et al. 2001b) neutrons (Bozkurt et al. 2000; Bozkurt et al. 2001), protons (Bozkurt and Xu 2004) and general dose comparison (Xu et al. 2005). 783</page><page sequence="6">We propose to demonstrate the feasibility of a Digital Human model that is centered around the VIP-Man model by establishing an integrated small-scale software modules to support four testbeds covering anatomical geometry modeling, radiation treatment planning, 4D CT imaging algorithm and virtual surgical simulations. The GeometryModelingBed will expand the VIP-Man model from 3D to 4D using the Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) to define the surfaces of the organs of the VIP- Man and clinically obtained respiratory motion data (Xu and Shi 2005). The RadiationPLanningBed will study advanced radiation treatment method (Wang et al. 2005). The TomolmagingBed will be aimed at studying multi-slice CT algorithms that have optimized image quality and patient exposure. The BiomechanicalBed will address issues related to the generation of multimodal virtual environments for surgical training (Jin et al. 2005). Figure 5 summarizes these testbeds which can be augmented in the future with additional biomedical engineering applications.

CONCLUSION An adult male whole-body model, VIP-Man, has been constructed from the color photographic images of the famous Visible Human Project®. VIP-Man has been adopted into the state-of-the-art Monte Carlo codes, EGS4, MCNP, and MCNPX for radiation transport studies and organ dose calculations involving photons, electrons, neutron, and protons. To date, VIP-Man represents one of the world's finest and most complete human anatomical models, containing small tissues, such as skin, Gl track mucosa, eye lenses, and red bone marrow, that were not (or not as realistically) represented in the MIRD-based stylized models and other image-based tomographic models. This is also the first time that an image-based whole-body model was adopted for Monte Carlo calculations involving electrons, neutrons and protons. Recently, cardiac motions have been added to create a 4D VIP-Man model that can be used to study radiation treatment on lung cancer. These advances are significant in that we now are able to investigate subtle dose variations in relatively small and moving anatomical structures from various charged particles. The new capability in multiple particle transport and in 4D organ simulations not only provides needed radiation protection dosimetric data but also opens doors for applications in radiotherapy. Compared to MIRD- based stylized models, VIP-Man is realistic and contains much more anatomical information. It should be noted, however, the Visible Human image data has its own shortcomings. For radiation protection dosimetry, the problem is that the subject does not represent an average adult male in terms weight and height (as shown in Table 1). This images also have a number of artifacts are need to be corrected. There is also a need to create a physical phantom of the VIP-Man so certain experiments can be performed to "validate" the calculated data. Currently, we are exploring 3D printing using various rapid prototyping and CAD software resources. Nevertheless, the VIP-Man model offers an excellent opportunity to study many issues related to radiation dosimetry. We have proposed to develop various digital human based biomedical engineering testbeds that can yield insight into exciting frontiers of research. These applications are based on radiological and mechanical properties that can be combined with the VIP-Man anatomical model. We are hoping to extend the Digital Human platform horizontally to include additional engineering applications, such as multiphase flow (for human respiratory and circulatory systems) and biochemical engineering (for drug discovery and virtual clinical trials), and vertically to include models at the cellular and molecular levels.
