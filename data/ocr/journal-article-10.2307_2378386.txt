TUGWELL I C HARLES HORTON COOLEY at about the beginning of the century ob- served that there was no signifi- cant distinction to be made between indi- viduals and societies.' "The real thing," he said, "is Human Life, which may be considered in an individual aspect or in a social." Cooley was intending to analyze the effects of society on the individual in this particular work. As he began he ac- knowledged the essential likenesses of the individual organism and the social or- ganism of which it is part: Society, or any complex group, may, to ordinary observation, be a very different thing from all of its members viewed one by one-as a man who beheld General Grant's army from Missionary Ridge would have seen something other than he would by approaching every soldier in it.... There may, in all such cases, be a system or organization in the whole that is not apparent in the parts. In this sense, and in no other, is there a difference between society and the individuals of which it is com- posed; a difference not residing in the facts themselves but existing to the observer on account of the limits of his perception. A complete view of society would also be a com- plete view of all the individuals, and vice versa; there would be no difference between them. The book to which these remarks were an introduction was not only devoted ' In Human Nature and the Social Order (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, I902). mostly to the effect on individual human nature of association with others-the development of hostility, sympathy, emulation, the social conscience and leadership-it was written from the background of a particular environment. This was the American Middle West with its still-lingering characteristics of the frontier which included a necessary independence and individualism: there was no other way to get along on the bor- derland of civilization than by a ruthless subduing of natural enemies and by com- petition. The Middle West was not, even then, the heavily settled country it was destined to be. Social discipline was not strict, and technology had not yet bound individuals together with its tight nets of communication and transport. Yet, even from Ann Arbor in Michigan, Cooley could see the essential unity and endur- ing likenesses of all living beings and their societies. It has become much more obvious, as time has passed, that his observation was a penetrating one. By now it has become relevant everywhere; and, indeed, we can see now that it was always the rule and that the exceptions have been few. Even in the most primitive societies the indi- vidual and his group were more closely identified than they were during the 233</page><page sequence="2">234 ETHICS settling of the American continent. That period may, indeed, have been the prize exhibit of individualism in all history. And, of course, it changed so greatly as to be unrecognizable when settlement came and civilization developed. It is not strange, however, that the freedoms of that period should seem desirable to those whose memory may still run almost to the founding of its communities or even that the institutions inherited from that unique period should still seem fa- vorable.3 The phrase for that backward look toward the good old days is "historic homesickness," and this is a disease which seems to affect intellectuals along with others. For intellectuals, no less than others, in spite of an occasional per- ceptive philosopher or an historian like Turner, did not for a long time realize the uniqueness of the nineteenth century in America. They permitted homesickness for a vanished environment rather than realistic observation to shape their con- ceptions of man and his relation to the world. The United States is the last stronghold of an individualism which ex- presses itself in an economics of laissez faire, a political theory of checks and balances, and a social theory of natural individual rights. This is a situation which cannot en- dure, of course; conceptions which are ir- relevant to contemporary realities will die and be replaced by more useful ones. Facts are more stubborn than theories. But, as we are seeing now, their death may be a long and lingering one. It may, indeed, in a period of extremely rapid change, be so protracted as to involve 2 Cf. Robert H. Lowie, Primitive Society; G. V. Murdock, Our Primitive Contemporaries; Franz Boas, The Mind of Primitive Man; etc. 3 Frederick Jackson Turner's "The Significance of the Frontier in American History" is the classic exposition of this view, often repeated, sometimes criticized, but still full of meaning for its time. definite social dangers. It is unfortunate but true that most of the responsibility for this dangerous lag is attributable to universities, for it is there that individu- alism, laissez faire, and pluralistic politi- cal theories have their stronghold. The great contrast between the social and the physical sciences in this respect had its final exposure at Hiroshima. Today the old social science is as dated and inade- quate as Newtonian physics. Not all its expositors have yet widened their con- ceptions, but those who have not slowly wither on the tree of learning. II In trying to understand the relation of men to one another in society it is useful to have considered previously the rela- tions among simpler individuals and spe- cies who share with man the experience of life. Many zoologists and botanists have lately become ecologists rather than classifiers. They are, indeed, discovering that only as they study relationships can they really understand the phenomena of plant and animal as well as human life. The complex whole in which related things and individuals function has a sig- nificant life which conditions that of all its parts and members. As a beginning, consider the situation referred to by such writers as Allee and Emerson, whose relevant conclusions I venture to paraphrase, with due apology, in nontechnical language. Their account would begin somewhat as follows: The generalizations which emerge from studying ecological communities in the seas, the forests, the prairies, or the deserts reveal the existence of an interspecies biological inte- gration. There is order everywhere; there is specialization; there is co-operation. The in- fluences which bring about the established relationships are to be found both in the physi- cal and in the biotic environments. There are quantitative gradients which establish thresh-</page><page sequence="3">VARIATION ON A THEME BY COOLEY 235 olds of survival, and these in turn result in qualitative differences. A familiar example is that of a forest edge where there is more light than in the deep woods; where there are greater extremes of temperature than in the trees; where there is greater evaporation at the borders and like- wise more movement of the air. These are the conditions: the results are shown in quantitative differences among many species. These include the food plants, the plant-eaters among the animals, and the scavengers, predators, and parasites in the complex food web. There are found not only gradations indicating spatial organization but also temporal sequences. For instance, in the Lake Michigan dune country, poplars are an early tree; they are replaced by pines; pines are followed by oaks; and the climax is reached in a mixed beech-maple forest. In every environ- ment similar sequences can be observed. This succession is evolved through the conditions produced at each stage which prepare for the next. For instance, the dropping leaves of the poplar cause an accumulation of humus in the soil which reduces evaporation and gradu- ally eliminates the species adjusted to dry conditions and favors the survival of those which prefer more moisture. The early stages are not self-perpetuating; but the climax forest is one which is permanent along with all its dependent species. This permanent community develops great complexity, it loses some of the resistance earlier communities had to severe natural conditions; it develops instead a system of mutual interdependence which causes the risks and resistances to be shared. Within these per- manent complexes there are, among species, both conflict and co-operation- some merely tolerate each other, some live through reciprocal services. These relationships set up survival values which sort out a large number of genetic variables. Thus the whole community begins to move along another temporal dimension- that of organic evolution.4 The biologists bring us, in this way, to the theoretical borderland between bi- otic change which operates through the 4 W. C. Allee, Animal Life and Social Growth (Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1932); A. E. Emerson, "The Biological Basis of Social Coopera- tion," Illinois Academy of Science, Transactions, 1946. life and death of individuals and species -the disappearance of the poplars from the dunes-and that which occurs through modifications in the germ plasm. There is thus only a blurred distinction between individual and social evolution. The individual may be selected to suit a social purpose so that those individuals who are the parents of future generations are better accommodated to the condi- tions of the life they must lead. There is thus set up an evolutionary process through individual life and death and the survival of the well adapted which has somewhat the same effect as the inherit- ance of acquired characters-the La- marckism which caused so long a contro- versy among biologists.5 Social evolution takes place, it seems, not only by accum- ulation and modification of the cultural mass but by biological adaptation to it, even if that adaptation does not occur as it was once believed that it must. The social organism does not have a germ plasm; it does not have an individu- al life and death. It does, however, have an organization which not only is dimen- sional (spatial and temporal) but is modi- fied in evolutionary processes. It even uses the germ plasms of its individual constituents for this purpose. It is very complex and has delicate established re- lationships which reveal themselves to careful and continued observation; and any change in the physical or biotic en- vironments will set up a train of conse- quences which can be understood only by knowing the web of relationships which are thus disturbed, the influence of vari- ous conditions (as temperature, mois- S And which has been so strangely revived in our generation by Lysenko and his followers in the Soviet Union.

Even among the plants the relation- ships are extremely complex, especially when the influence of the biotic environ- ment is considered; but, when the ecolo- gists pass from plant to animal life, an even greater complexity is encountered. The same principles of adjustment hold; but there is a new factor. This is the de- velopment of teleological adjustment and the specialization of directive organs. Hitherto in the evolutionary advance only such factors as the web of life, the food chain, and the pyramid of numbers have been influential in integration. Only a gross and crude pressure has been used by nature. Since animals have self- conceived direction and organs for in- creased mobility, their power of move- ment and of quick accommodation is in- finitely greater than that of plants. There appears an altogether new unity in the species and in the interspecies communi- ty. And, when man is studied, this be- comes the apparently dominant motif in evolution. In society individuals are spe- cialized and are specialized in their as- sociations; these specialized groups are of mutual use and live together through necessity.6 III The individual organism, of course, has gradually changed its character; and, through the processes of evolution, the higher species have gradually come into possession of a specialized directing ap- paratus. This appeared first as a faintly recognizable anterior area which for some reason had a higher metabolic rate and greater sensitivity.7 In the higher ani- mals this area through the years became 6 Cf. J. E. Weaver and F. E. Clements, Plant Ecology; A. S. Pearse, Animal Ecology; and J. W. Bews, Human Ecology. a brain, a thinking organ, specialized to co-ordinate the other organs and to give them common direction. In this, as in other adaptations, there are great differences among the species and some differences among individuals within species. Not all animals are able to co-ordinate well. Allee notes, for in- stance, that the jellyfish is one of those animals which, although it has a recog- nizable mass, and is even radially sym- metrical, has very little directive special- ization. It has sensitive areas surround- ing each of numerous jelly-like disks; and any one of these is able to originate im- pulses which set up the rhythmic pulsa- tions by which the animal moves; it is, therefore, temporarily dominant. As the evolutionary scale is ascended, one re- gion or end of the animal is more and more definitely specialized to become the anterior whose first function it is to meet and deal with new stimuli in the environ- ment. This becomes the concentrating point for sense organs and nervous tissue; it is finally recognizable not only as the anterior but as the head. Here there de- velops a definitely higher metabolic rate; there is a center for communications and the interchange of impulses; and it is the region where leadership comes to reside and to provide direction for all the rest of the body. It is impossible to read the biologists' descriptions of this evolutionary develop- ment without thinking of the close analo- gy there must be with social evolution. And, indeed, Allee goes on to indicate how apt the analogy is.8 He uses a num- ber of illustrations to show how definite localized leadership has come to be not 7 This is an area of biological controversy which is here avoided by the weasel phrase "for some reason," but deliberately; it is not important for the present intention. 8 Op. Cit., pp. 152 ff.</page><page sequence="5">VARIATION ON A THEME BY COOLEY 237 only among the lower animals but among men. In a herd of cows, for instance, he describes how, if the bull is not present, the oldest cow is deferred to, with others falling into rank; and, of course, he ana- lyzes the classic "peck order" among the hens of a flock. He even goes on to identi- fy the same phenomenon as it was ob- served by him in the faculty meetings of a New England college: As the head of the group in a large, high- backed chair, sat the president looking down the table to his dean seated in a chair not nearly so large and impressive. Around this table in order of seniority tat the professors in comfort- able, even though low-backed, arm chairs. Back of them, again in order of seniority, sat the associate and assistant professors but in hard- bottomed Windsor chairs; while at the foot of the table in hard, uncomfortable "kitchen" chairs sat the instructors, who were supposed to be present but not to take part in the dis- cussions unless asked to do so.9 Just at the end of this discussion Allee comes to his most significant observa- tion. It is this: when primitive animals develop a specialized organization along a head-to-tail axis, the anterior end is dictatorially dominant; that is to say, the subordinate parts have very little influ- ence on the dominant region. But in the more developed mammals, notably in man, the brain has close and instantane- ous back-and-forth connections with all the body's other parts; and there then develops something which closely re- sembles "physiological democracy as con- trasted with the physiological autocracy of the more primitive animals with distinct heads." In the higher animals there is a most intricate and delicate development to facilitate democratic operations. All parts of the body are involved, including prominently the viscera, the endocrine glands acting through the blood stream, and the muscles. They determine not 9 Ibid., p. I54. only the physiological condition of the brain, and so the level of awareness and the health of nervous connections, but definitely suggest the necessary reac- tions. Allee is quite right: it is a demo- cratic arrangement with provision for leadership and the maintenance of direc- tion. The analogy between this highly de- veloped mammal and equally advanced social groups is even more striking than similar analogies at lower levels. There is a specialization of parts with well-devel- oped mechanisms for communication- signs, language, and more and more ef- fective means for their transmission. And, strikingly, as in the animal, when the development is very advanced, de- mocracy is substituted for autocracy. All parts of the social organism are, so to speak, consulted; and decisions are reached co-operatively. It is with society, at this stage, as it is with the higher ani- mals: the parts are so interlaced and in- terdependent that none can be said to be of greater importance than others. The whole is so closely held together by the nervous system and the blood stream that what affects any, affects all. Deci- sions, therefore, on all actions are of im- portance to all parts, and they are ap- propriately included in the processes of collective decision. Allee, contemplating this, comes to the point of saying directly that "the organization of the individual may be compared with that in the highly organized bird flocks, or in colonies of ants, or in the best human societies in which the reactions seem to be group- controlled rather than controlled by one individual.sIo And he does not fail to note that social organizations in which laws rather than men rule are the ulti- mate in social development. There devel- ops, even among bees, an elan or common 'IO Ibid.) p., 59.</page><page sequence="6">238 ETHICS agreement which is called "the spirit of the hive"; and this instinctive agreement or common consent is substituted for the older and more primitive struggle for survival. Co-operation has now had its final triumph. Such competition as still exists is a kind of competition in good works which can result only in social benefit. And, of course, the highest or- ganizations dispense even with leader- ship; "the individuals composing the group become entirely group-centered rather than individually minded. There is neither authority nor obedience, for neither is needed in the face of complete cooperation for the common good."" IV When protozoan life proved insuffi- cient for nature's purposes and metozoan organization began, what seems in many ways the most startling change in all evo- lution took place. It was comparable, in life-history, only to such events as the beginning of life itself, to the differentia- tion of the sexes, to the wonderful inven- tion of individual death, and the subse- quent development of social immortality. Animals in a way really ceased to be ani- mals when multicellular aggregations ap- peared. They became small societies; and it often required eons of time for species and individuals to acquire such definite character and behavior as to be clearly identifiable. Some of them, as always happens in evolution, became arrested at or near the border line and can now be studied as nature's failures-or perhaps her indifference. For us, one of the inter- esting characteristics of the animal or- ganizations surviving at that stage is the remarkable likeness between those early multicellular animals and the aggrega- tions of animals-including human be- ings-which we have not ordinarily re- II Ibid. garded as organic. The truth is, however, that the likenesses are startling and the differences very few. And, of course, we can understand that this is because the same purpose is gained in both cases: there can be an indefinite enlargement of the organism upon which the blind in- fluences of natural selection can act; and the individual-like the cell of the ani- mal-merged in the larger organism, is not exposed to the immediate effects of selection. This protection allows the indi- vidual to vary and become differentiated -specialized-to a degree which would be fatal if he were not part of a whole. At the same time it allows a new kind of free and sometimes marvelous development for the whole organism because all the differentiated individuals working at their specialty, in harmony and sheltered as they are, may produced unprecedent- ed and sometimes magnificent results. We may say that societies of individual animals were in strictly logical succession to societies of cells in the animal and that the same results were gained. This proc- ess produced the smoothly functioning societies of the bees, the ants, and many other animals without troublesome indi- vidual anterior developments. One of na- ture's problems arose just here: how to transfer to the multicellular society the thinking apparatus which had become so highly developed in some multicellular animals. There are animals in which the mouth, the locomotor apparatus, and the sexual mechanisms still try to-and sometimes succeed in-thinking for themselves. This results in the kind of disorganization, conflict, and frustration which would be expected: sometimes, in some animals, it eventually involves par- tial or complete destruction. These, of course, are the arrested species which perhaps did not develop because they found themselves able to maintain a kind</page><page sequence="7">VARIATION ON A THEME BY COOLEY 239 of low, slow life as they were and were not sufficiently dissatisfied (or malad- justed) so that they had to start on the uncomfortable and risky business of change. But their low thresholds of toler- ance and their lack of adaptability often betrayed them. Biological history is lit- tered with these deceased species who may have lingered for some time or may have disappeared quite quickly. Societies made up of individuals show the same characteristics. Some are evolv- ing rapidly toward a more differentiated and complex life; some are apparently content to remain at an arrested stage. Those which are arrested at any stage risk the constant danger, of course, that the rigid environmental conditions they require may be changed. Their thresh- olds of tolerance are too easily crossed. The more primitive groups of human savages, for instance, since this is a finite globe, are apparently doomed. There is not enough space to give them the ex- ploitable area they require, since the more developed groups require it, too, and in competition are very much strong- er. And the analogy can be extended, if more subtle distinctions are observed, to many higher groups than savages. Not all living men, by any means, are des- tined to be the ancestors of future gen- erations. The weakness in the furthest advanced groups is the same as that of the more ad- vanced individuals too. No part of them -no individual, no subsidiary group- can live without the whole. Differentia- tion and specialization have gone so far that, although as part of the great whole, the individual or the small group func- tions happily and effectively, it could not function at all, could not even live, apart from the whole. The parts acquire the vulnerabilities of the whole. To the whole often but one mistake is permitted. If one decision is amiss and leads to disadjust- ment, it may be fatal to all its co-operat- ing members which are its self. There is obviously required, as a part of the evolutionary process, in the crea- tion of the society, as also in the creation of the individual, along with that differ- entiation and specialization which pro- duces such marvels of efficiency, some protections against disorganization, in- discipline, and liability to fatal error. In the individual made up of many cells there are arrangements for these func- tions and penalties for misbehavior of the parts which are well understood. In soci- eties they may be equally well under- stood.'2 There are means for cohesion- there is even an instinct of gregarious- ness ;I3 and there are mechanisms for se- curing discipline and even mutual help. What has been slowest to develop-as in the animal individual-is the directive or conjunctural apparatus. Speculation as to the reason for this slowness would require an appraisal of the stage of evolution which human soci- eties have by now reached; and this ap- praisal would need to be in terms of the logical objectives toward which they ap- pear to be proceeding. But also there would need to be investigation of the transfer of directive authority from the cell to the multicellular organism-from the individual to society-and, indeed, the whole relation of parts to wholes in human association, which is made diffi- cult by the high development of the brain in man and the arrest, or partial arrest, I2 Although there are problems for societies which multicellular animals do not have; there is not, for instance, that physiological union which enables the blood to flow to every part, etc. Social connections are far more tenuous. '3 As W. Trotter calls it in Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War (New York: Macmillan Co., I9I7), an extraordinarily perceptive book from which I have long drawn inspiration.</page><page sequence="8">240 ETHICS of individual evolution. It is obvious, I think, that there is an evolutionary pres- sure in such changes which makes devo- lution as unthinkable as Trotter says it is: There is some inherent property in mobile living organisms that makes combination of individuals into larger units a more or less inevitable course of development-without any gross variation being necessary to initiate it. The complex evolution which multicellularity made possible and perhaps enforced can scarcely fail to make one wonder whether the gregarious animal has not entered upon a path which must of necessity lead to increasing complexity and coordination, to a more and more stringent intensity of integration or to extinction.I Since the advantages of specialization require high co-ordination, reaching, at length, the levels of conjuncture, it seems clear that, unless nature has made a fatal error in the case of man, the individuals of society must possess not only the capacity for the requisite specialization, the proper sympathies, and the instincts for discipline but, even if latent, the requisite capacities for integration and direction. The richest specialization will be of no real use if it cannot be controlled to the uses of the whole organism, and the most perfect control of the individual cells will be incapable of insuring prog- ress if it has no material of original varia- tion to work on. Not to pursue this matter further, I may perhaps quote a passage from Trot- ter which seems to me to express the hu- man dilemma not only concisely but completely: The community of the honey bee bears a close resemblance to the body of a complex ani- mal. The capacity for actual structural speciali- zation of the individuals in the interests of the hive has been remarkable and has gone far, while at the same time co-ordination has been stringently enforced, so that each individual 4 Ibid., pp. I03-4- is actually absorbed into the community, ex- pends all its activities therein, and when exclud- ed from it is almost as helpless as a part of the naked flesh of an animal detached from its body. The hive may, in fact, without any very undue stretch of fantasy, be described as an animal of which all the individual cells have retained the power of locomotion. When one watches the flight of a swarm of bees its unanimity and directness very easily produce the illusion that one is witnessing the migration of a single animal usually sedentary but at times capable of undertaking journeys with a formidable and successful energy. This new animal differs from the other animals of the metazoa which it has outdistanced in the race of evolution, not merely in its immense power, energy, and flexibility, but also in the almost startling fact that it has recovered the . . . immortality which seemed to have been lost with its proto- zoal ancestors. The extent to which the hive makes use of the powers of its individuals is the measure of the completeness with which the social habit is developed in it. The worker bee has practically no activities which are not directly devoted to the hive, and yet she goes about her ceaseless tasks in a way that never fails to impress the observer with its exuberant energy and even its appearance of joyfulness. It is thought that the average worker bee works herself to death in about two months. That is a fact which can scarcely fail to arouse, even in the least imaginative, at any rate a moment of profound contemplation. If we could suppose her to be conscious in the human sense, we must imagine the bee to be possessed by an enthusiasm for the hive more intense than a mother's devotion to her son, without personal ambitions, or doubts or fears, and if we are to judge by the imperfect experience man has yet had of the same lofty passion, we must think of her consciousness, insignificant spark as it is, as a little fire ablaze with altruistic feeling. Doubtless, such an attribution of emotion to the bee is a quite unjustified fallacy of anthropomorphism. Nev- ertheless, it is not altogether valueless as a hint of what social unity might effect in an animal of larger mental life. There can be little doubt that the perfection to which the communal life of the bee has attained is dependent on the very smallness of the mental development of which the individuals are capable. Their capacity to assimilate experience is, necessarily from their structure, and is known by experience to be,</page><page sequence="9">VARIATION ON A THEME BY COOLEY 24I small, and their path is marked out so plainly by actual physical modifications that the al- most miraculous absorption of the worker in the hive is after all perhaps natural enough. If she were able to assimilate general experience on a larger scale to react freely and appropriately to stimuli external to the hive, there can be little doubt that the community would show a less concentrated efficiency than it does today. The standing miracle of the bee- her sensitiveness to the voice of the hive and her capacity to com- municate with her fellows-would undoubtedly be less marvelously perfect if she were not at the same time deaf to all other voices.'5 V Human societies have, of course, not evolved so far as have those of the bees; or else they have taken a different line of development. They are, anyway, com- pared with the bees, lacking in co-ordina- tion and cohesion, groping for concerted objectives and in jeopardy to disruptive influences. Wherever the human species is going, neither the objectives nor the methods are yet agreed. The method of adaptation to both the physical and the biotic environments may be quite differ- ent from those of such species as the bees or the ants; but here, again, there are in- teresting analogies which deserve further examination than they have yet had. It is to be noted, for instance, that the physical conditions are not very differ- ent. The ants inhabit a range of climate which is as varied as that of men. They protect themselves, not by growing win- ter coats or by hibernating, but by build- ing protective habitations. They have long since left the stage of individuality and have reached a stage of infinitely complex differentiations and interde- pendences, all woven into a social web. No ant could live alone. Only a far and primitive ancestor could have done that. Such struggles as they have among them- selves are far more between well-inte- is Ibid., pp. I05-7. grated colonies than between individuals. They have passed beyond the stage of democracy as men mean it-the arrival at social decision through discussion, conflict of opinion, and majority rule- and have become so group-centered and like-minded that there is no surviving authority or obedience. Even their mech- anism for physical inheritance is so high- ly specialized that single mothers carry the responsibilities for the future of whole groups.'6 Man, of course, has a distinguishing feature which is different from that of the bees and the ants. That is, of course, his brain with its power of reflection and de- cision. Reflectiveness has led to the ac- cumulation of vast masses of cultural material upon which to exercise this abil- ity. Some observers have regarded this as man's only really distinctive trait. He has been called, for instance, "a time- binder"-meaning that he accumulates, through time, the power to become more and more effective in managing the phys- ical and biotic environments because he uses the accumulated experience of those who have gone before. It has also been pointed out that this mechanism which furnishes so great an advantage also con- tains the possibility of his greatest danger. Instead of coming with relative rapid- ity to the stage at which his societies are controlled by "the spirit of the hive," or even by the operations of well-under- stood custom or law, man lingers in a stage of intellectual individualism. This would not be dangerous in a thinly settled, noncommunicative world, in which small colonies enjoyed at least relative immunity from the predations of others-such as nineteenth-century i6 Thus, interestingly enough, reducing the chance of variation and departure from the social norm.</page><page sequence="10">242 ETHICS America was. But in one which has be- come, through the operations of that su- perior brain which is his pride, closely settled, which possesses the means of instantaneous world-wide intercommuni- cation and almost instantaneous trans- port, the temptation of some groups to exterminate others seems irresistible and promises to be fatally effective. This is partly attributable, of course, to the substitution of teleology for other means of adaptation. There is ample evi- dence that man has not changed-that his psychological and mental equipment has not been sustantially altered-for many thousands of generations. Instead of being shaped by his environment as are other species of living beings, he undertook, far back in prehistory, to go on from where he was, not chiefly by ac- commodating himself through changes in his body or mind, but by changing every- thing around him-the earth, the sky, other forms of life-to his requirements. When he began to experiment and in- vent, he undertook what has proved not only to be an effective control of environ- ment but one which, however effective, may turn out not to have been calculated with sufficient foresight. To be complete- ly successful in his tour de force, he would not only have to know everything but to agree on everything. If he over- looked any important element of the en- vironment, if he failed to gain control of all the elements, or if he failed to secure agreement as to their management, the oversight, the lack of control, or even the controversy, might well prove, at some late stage, disastrous. The disaster would come at a late stage because not until the final tests of world-crowding by his race, the pushing toward the ultimate of the possibilities of nutrition, the approach of finality in instant intercommunication and transportation, would he find out whether he had actually succeeded. It was a magnificent, a glorious choice. Its unexampled effrontery, its challenge to the forces of the universe, stir the imagination as no other undertaking in the history of life on this planet has the power to do. We are, however, coming to the time when we see that it was, in the deepest meaning of the word, an awful adventure; and we begin to suspect that the great brain of man has got to be worked harder and harder-perhaps harder than it is capable of working-if he is to survive as the final tests come upon him. For up to now he has been more clever, more accumulative, more in- dividually reflective, than profound, in understanding the universe or in agreeing on what is required of him, in the way of discipline, by its conditions. He has not been freed from the uni- verse and what is in it. He has merely undertaken to understand and use it for his own advantage-which is a very dif- ferent matter. His impression that he is eternally ingenious is all very well; it has led to marvels, really, of mechanical con- trivance; but something more is needed for the tests which he is about to face. He has got to accept, presently, the con- comitant of his inventiveness. And this is an almost absolute foresight in the use of inventiveness and an almost perfect accommodation to the constantly new environment it produces. Otherwise it can be seen that what he has created is likely to destroy him. Disagreements, in- disciplines, conflicts, and resorts to force are all very well, racially considered, so long as they do not actually threaten racial injury or destruction. But they now do that. For force, at the disposal of still dissident and irresponsible groups of men, has at its disposal, in the contempo- rary world, such products of that superior brain as atom':bombsJethal bacteria, radioactive mists, and other such genu- inely ultimate weapons. And force is not</page><page sequence="11">VARIATION ON A THEME BY COOLEY 243 man's only danger; his reproductive ap- paratus, not being centralized in hive mothers, and calculated, almost like the broadcast pollen, to start a thousand lives that one may survive, is very little subject to the control of the world com- munity in which its effects are made manifest. There is, therefore, no neces- sary correlation between man's power to produce progeny and his ability to nour- ish and educate them. As a matter of fact, the disparities here indicate power- ful racial forces which favor the as yet unaverted disaster of wholesale starva- tion. The social disciplines necessary to the regulation of numbers are not yet in being; there is still a fatal dependence on the crude and cruel checks involved in multitudinous deaths before maturity; and man's inherent racial loyalties tend always to limit these. Something more is urgently needed. VI This is the background of mankind's compulsion to find a new kind of contriv- ing ability in that rich nature with which he was equipped when he took off into the evolutionary blue so long ago. He must foresee, he must control, he must agree. This means that he must have so- cial mechanisms capable of containing and mastering the forces and materials to be understood, controlled, and socially accepted. It has to be said of this process, also, that it is a unitary one. It has to compre- hend not one, not a few, but all the ele- ments of the environment and the cul- ture-and simultaneously. If there are any which escape, which are not brought into an understood relationship with the central process at given times, they will tend to gain the advantages without ac- cepting the limitations of common living and may therefore become gigantic and monstrous, exploiting the rest. That, in- deed, is what can be seen to have hap- pened in economic and social life during the period since the Industrial Revolu- tion and especially in America since i850. The trusts and cartels have been officially frowned on; but the policy for controlling them has been wholly nega- tive and so wholly ineffective. Today they threaten our civilization with Frankensteinian horrors. The Development Plan with both spa- tial and temporal dimension, is the de- vice which the planner offers for the solu- tion of certain of these social and eco- nomic problems. He suggests also that it represents an approach to that democra- cy of which Allee spoke, in which all the parts of the social organism co-operate in a co-ordinated whole as happens in the well-articulated human being. Since the perfection of modern paper-work tech- niques for administration and the ap- proach to ultimates in communication and transportation, the operation of the Development Plan can hardly be said to be technically impossible for any recog- nizable colony of men. The natural scien- tists have posed the ultimatum: "peace or destruction." With this ultimatum in- sistently demanding to be recognized, delay in abandoning the Smithian eco- nomics and Lockeian politics has become a heavy responsibility indeed for those who advocate it.
