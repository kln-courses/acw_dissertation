<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Political Turn in Criticism By DENIS DONOGHUE In the Januaiy-Februaiy 1953 issue of Partisan Review, John Crowe Ransom reviewing R. P. Blackmur's Language as Gesture took issue with him upon one consideration, that in ap- praising the social and political issues which inhabit Yeats's major poems Blackmur remarked only their function within the work, not the ideas as such, even though they might be "ideas from which, at the veiy moment, out in the world of ac- tion, the issues of life and death are hung.1* Blackmur, accord- ing to Ransom, was repudiating "the ideas as ideas, and reckoning their usefulness for the poem." Ransom had especially in view "The Later Poetry of W.B. Yeats" (1936) in which Blackmur spoke of Yeats's "Byzantium" as "the poetry of an intense and condensed declaration; not emotion put into doctrine from outside, but doctrine presented as emotion." Blackmur spoke, too, of the companion-poem "Sailing to Byzantium" as exhibiting "the doctrine in action, the doctrine actualized in a personal emotion resembling that of specific prayer." Then he concluded the essay with a large consideration: When we call man a rational animal we mean that reason is his great myth. Reason is plastic and takes to any form provided. The rational imagination in 1 John Crowe Ransom: "More than Gesture": Partisan Review, January- February 1953: reprinted in his Poems and Essays (New York: Vintage Books, 1955), p. 104</page><page sequence="2">The Political Turn in CHticism 105 poetry, as elsewhere, can absorb magic as a provisional method of evocative and heuristic think- ing, but it cannot be based upon it. In poetry, and lar- gely elsewhere, imagination is based upon the reality of words and the emotion of their joining. Yeats's magic, then, like every other feature of his ex- perience, is rational as it reaches words; otherwise it is his privation, and ours, because it was the ration- al defect of our society that drove him to it.2 I have adverted to this little episode between Ransom and Blackmur because it anticipates many of the issues I shall try to describe in my own terms, and partly because we might clarify the issues by requiring each of the disputants to be somewhat more forthcoming. We might ask Ransom what status he assigned to ideas as such, and how they acquired such privilege, and whether or not he thought the ideas so con- sidered remained intact in that character during and after their involvement in the poem. Are they already a virtual poetry, or merely as Blackmur seemed to imply, raw material for a possible poem? We might ask Blackmur whether he was really content to regard the production of ideas as a matter of ad libbing, of informal play before the commitment of the words is made. Was he content to give the poet every latitude till the play transpired in decisive words, and to judge the de- gree of decisiveness by an unexplained correlation of emotion and rhythm, the emotion animating a rhythm till that moment merely virtual? When Blackmur says that Yeats's magic is ra- tional as it reaches words, he seems to mean that the poetical character is wayward till it finds a proper syntax for its emo- tions, and that, so much found, nothing that has preceded the finding matters, every caprice is forgivable as merely auxiliary to the order arrived at. But we might have to ask Blackmur how he could be sure that the syntax found is the order of the rational imagination and not of some sinister force that has as- sumed the mask of reason and has had no difficulty in appear- ing plausible. Blackmur's answer would probably invoke the 2 R. P. Blackmur, Form and Value in Modern Poetry (Garden City, New York: Doubleday Anchor Books, 1957), p. 58.</page><page sequence="3">106 DENIS DONOGHUE evidence of form; as in writing of Allen Täte he said that for Täte events do not become experience till the imagination creates them in objective form, and further and more com- prehensively that "the act of experience, in the arts, transpires only in form." What has not transpired in its particular form cannot be said to have been experienced. For the moment, however, we need only advert to the gist of the episode. For Blackmur, ideas in a poem have merely opportunistic or other- wise instrumental value. For Ransom, the question was: must they not also have constitutive value, and be judged by cor- respondingly strict criteria? II It is a commonplace that recent critical theory has taken a distinctly political turn. After twenty years in which theory was in a dependent relation to epistemology, linguistics, anthropology, and psychoanalysis, it now proceeds in a parasitic relation to politics, either of the Right or, more loudly, of the Left. The wind is now blowing from Germany, not from France: the main sources of authority are Marx and the neo- Marxist Frankfurt critics, especially Benjamin, Adorno, and Horkheimer, with selective acknowledgement to Lukacs. Debates between Habermas, Gadamer, and Ricoeur are best understood in that setting. For the time being, the Frankfurt way of being serious has displaced the Parisian way of being rueful. ra I shall cite two examples of the political turn, the first from close to home. In Ireland, readers of Yeats, Joyce, and Synge are interrogating these writers in a far harsher spirit than any I recall. It is regularly suggested that Yeats, in par- ticular, bears some responsibility for the violence and death- dealing in Northern Ireland since 1968. Seamus Deane, for instance, has argued in his Celtic Revivals (1985) that Yeats turned a misreading of Irish history into an extraordinarily potent mythology which in some sense is being acted out by young people who have never perhaps read a word of his</page><page sequence="4">The Political Turn in Criticism 107 poetry. Yeats, that is, construed the Protestant Ascendancy as an aristocracy, so that he could endow it with the power and grace he ascribed to Italian Renaissance princes, while in fact the Ascendancy was "a predominantly bourgeois social forma- tion.11 To fulfill the logic of his enterprise, Yeats also conjured into existence the Irish peasant, so that the kinship of peasant and aristocrat, predicated on the working of land, would provide a paradigm of an Ireland heroic in its difference; most tellingly, in its difference from an England given over to science, positivism, empiricism, and industrialization. It fol- lows, according to Deane, that Yeats derived a politics from an aesthetic: he sought "to obliterate or reduce the problems of class, economic development, bureaucratic organization and the like, concentrating instead upon the essences of self, com- munity, nationhood, racial theory, Zeitgeist."3 To some extent, therefore, Yeats is responsible for the situation in the North, where ostensibly political actions are propelled in fact by an- cestral images and powerfully deployed symbols. In this spirit, Deane refers to Yeats's "Ancestral Houses". The poem, he says, owes its force to the vitality with which it offers a ver- sion of Ascendancy history as true in itself. The truth of this historical reconstruction of the Ascendancy is not cancelled by our simply saying No, it was not like that. For its ultimate validity is not historical, but mythical. In this case, the mythical element is given prominence by the meditation on the fate of an origi- nary energy when it becomes so effective that it trans- forms nature into civilization and is then transformed itself by civilization into decadence. This poem, then, appears to have a story to tell and, along with that, an interpretation of the story's meaning. It operates on the narrative and on the conceptual planes and at the intersection of these it emerges, for many readers, as a poem about the tragic nature of human existence 3 Seamus Deane, Celtic Revivals (London: Faber and Faber, 1985), p. 33.</page><page sequence="5">108 DENIS DONOGHUE itself.4 Deane repudiates what he calls this humanist reading of the poem, on the grounds that it claims that a work of literature "can arrive at a moment in which it takes leave of history or myth... and becomes meaningful only as an aspect of the 'human condition'." It endorses, he maintains, the humanist conviction that literature, in its highest forms, is free of ideo- logy. I shall comment a little on Deane's position before citing my other example of the political turn. It strikes me that his invidious distinction between history and myth is itself ideological because he has not established it, he has merely as- sumed it. Whether we approve or not, myth is as real as his- tory; language offers hospitality to both, with little show of favor to one more than the other. Neither of them is given by nature or arises spontaneously. Nor has Deane established that a consideration of Ireland in terms of class, economic development, and the like is ideologically innocent by com- parison with discriminations in terms of caste and race which are ideologically guilty. Deane is reading "Ancestral Houses" as if it were an editorial in a newspaper. Besides, there are indeed human experiences of which the appropriate account is not historical but mythological. I am persuaded by Northrop Frye to distinguish between mythology and ideology in this respect. An ideology, he says, "expresses secondary and derivative human concerns": ideologies are derived from mythology, "which expresses the primary desires of existence, along with the anxieties attached to their frustra- tion."5 The ground of the distinction is biological, it is based upon one's bodily form and its relation to the earth; upon a metabiology rather than a metaphysic, to invoke a distinction by Kenneth Burke. Mythology, in Fiye's sense, doesn't float free of history, it may be verified upon historically acceptable evidence at any moment. But it calls, too, for a description 4 Seamus Deane, "Heroic Styles: The Tradition of an Idea": (Deny: A Field Day Pamphlet, No. 4, 1984), p.6. 6 Northrop Frye, "In the Earth, or in the Air?": Times Literary Supplement, January 17, 1986, p. 52.</page><page sequence="6">The Political Turn in Criticism 109 which recognizes the primordial character of the experiences it expresses. "Ancestral Houses" posits a certain primordial mode of experience, which Yeats regards as analogous to an organic sequence - birth, growth, maturity, decay, death - which, he is hardly obliged to prove, may be verified by recourse to histori- cal evidence. I can't see that Yeats's rhetorical position in this poem is more vulnerable than Deane's or mine. IV My second witness is Fredric Jameson, a critic for whom a political passion provides every incentive, literature, film, and architecture providing the occasions of acting upon it. In his essay on Ulysses, his study of Wyndham Lewis, and The Political Unconscious, Jameson has developed a theory of Modernism according to which many of the received works of modern literature constitute only a scandal. Briefly, he argues that Anglo-American modernism has been dominated by an impressionistic aesthetic: The most influential formal impulses of canonical modernism have been strategies of inwardness, which set out to reappropriate an alienated universe by transforming it into personal styles and private languages: such wills to style have seemed in retrospect to reconfirm the veiy privatization and fragmentation of social life against which they meant to protest. The modernist strategy issues from Symbolism, which Jameson regards as featuring "the illicit transformation of ex- isting things into so many visible or tangible meanings." Il- licit, because the transformation surreptitiously brings into a single act of perception the experienced and the intelligible. Any work of literature, therefore, that is founded upon Sym- 6 Fredric Jameson, Fables of Aggression (Berkeley: University of California- Press, 1979), p.2. 7 Fredric Jameson, "Ulysses in History": in W. J. McCormack and Alistair Stead (eds.), James Joyce and Modern Literature (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1982), p. 129.</page><page sequence="7">110 DENIS DONOGHUE bolism is to be rejected, since it offers to turn a predicament into a privilege, it provides an otherwise alienated reader with an unquestionable recourse to his own privacy and subjec- tivity, and encourages him to feel that his truth is to be found and enjoyed there. In Ulysses, whatever Bloom encounters is mediated through his subjectivity, and the whole is "unified by the stylistic tone in which all contradictions are ironically resolved as well as by the overall unity of Bloom's personality. " So "the Joycean phantasmagoria, even in the Nighttown chap- ter, serves to reconfirm the unity of the psyche, and to reinvent that depth-psychological perspective from which these private fantasies spring." Joyce has played into the hands of the enemy; he has given his reader the consolation prize of a res- tored subjectivity. Jameson's reading of Ulysses, to go no further than that book, is disabled by his insistence that literature will serve a political cause: what the cause is, it makes no theoretical dif- ference to specify. Jameson's immediate authority for his rejec- tion of Symbolism, I would guess, is the passage in The Origin of German Tragic Drama where Benjamin juxtaposes the al- legorical and the symbolic ways of seeing, much to the moral advantage of allegory: Whereas in the symbol, destruction is idealized and the transfigured face of nature is fleetingly revealed in the light of redemption, in allegory the observer is confronted with the fades hippocratica of history as a petrified, primordial landscape. Everything about history that, from the very beginning, has been un- timely, sorrowful, unsuccessful, is expressed in a face - or rather, in a death's head. And although such a thing lacks all "symbolic" freedom of expression, all classical proportion, all humanity - nevertheless, this is the form in which man's subjection to nature is most obvious and it significantly gives rise not only to the enigmatic question of the nature of human ex- istence as such, but also of the biographical historicity 8 Jameson, Fables of Aggression, p. 57.</page><page sequence="8">The Political Turn in Criticism 111 of the individual.9 (I might note that "hippocratica" denotes the livid, shrunken image of the body, immediately before death; it is so named be- cause Hippocrates was the first to describe it.) It follows from Benjamin's invidious meditation on allegory and symbol that the moral superiority of the allegorical vision consists in its refusal of comfort, redemption, and unity: according to Ben- jamin, the occasional felicities of man in nature are specious, anthropomorphic delusions, to be set aside by a relentless sense of history as death. Allegory testifies to a refusal to be appeased, it resents every token of unity, the seeming conjunc- tion of existence and meaning. Jameson contrasts Ulysses with The Childermass, much to the advantage of the latter; because Lewis refuses to be comforted, seeks the dispersal rather than the unification of subjectivity, takes precaution against homogeneity of tone, "composes by phrase, by larger word- units drawn from various sources which are never completely subdued and mastered by the overall form of the sentence it- self."10 Jameson's comparison of Joyce and Lewis serves a politi- cal purpose. It doesn't matter that Lewis's own political at- titudes were flagrantly Right. What matters is that he devised a style which refuses to conspire with personality, subjectivity, homogeneity. The resentment which is the most evident fea- ture of his common style can be dealt with later: for the mo- ment, Jameson can produce him as the faciès hippocratica of a modern literature otherwise rotten with inwardness and its consolations. ν My objection to such procedures as those I have recited from Deane and Jameson would be just as severe if they served another political cause: in any case, they compromise the 9 Walter Bei'jamin, The Origin of German Tragic Drama, tr.

They defeat the literature in advance. But the question now arises: what form would a serious engagement with literature take, if not a political form which turned it into propaganda ? In approaching an answer, I disclaim any originality for it by alluding to its constituents, these being the work of other hands. I merely bring the pieces together to suggest a programme all the better for its slightness. I begin with a passage from "Yeats and the Language of Symbolism", where Fiye distinguishes between the natural man and poetic man: Once a poet finds his mask, and it becomes the out- ward form of his creative life, it loses all real connec- tion with his natural life... The poet, by presenting us with a vision of nobility and heroism, detaches that vision from our ordinary lives. He thus works in a direction exactly opposite to that of the political leader who insists on tiying to attach it, and so per- verts its nature, as fascism perverted the Nietzschean gospel of heroic virtue into the most monstrous negation of it that the world has ever seen... The artist, of course, is always, like Narcissus, apt to become enamored with the reflecting illusion of his own mask. Yeats himself did not possess every kind of high intelligence, and some affectations resulting from a pedantic streak in his make-up led him into a certain amount of social and political dithering. But for all that we should not be too quick to plaster a fascist label on Yeats's myth merely be- cause a conspiracy of thugs happened to debase that myth instead of some other one... Poetic symbolism is language and not truth, a means of expression and not a body of doctrine, not something to look at but something to look and speak through, a dramatic mask. "The poet", said Sir Philip Sidney, "never affir- meth"; when he does affirm, he not only ceases to be a poet, but is as likely to be wrong as anyone else. 11 Northrop Frye, Fables of Identity (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1963), p. 238.</page><page sequence="10">The Political Turn in CHticism 113 I assume that when a poet affirms, in Fiye's sense or Sidney's, he voids the distinction which Hegel makes, in the En- cyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences, between Imagination and Reason: "Imagination.. .is reason, but only a nominal reason, because the matter or theme it embodies is to imagination qua imagination a matter of indifference; while reason qua reason also insists upon the truth of its content." (Section 457). This implies - and it leads me to the second constituent, a passage from Frank Kermode's The Sense of an Ending - that a poet does well to remain among his fictions, and to regard them as "heuristic and dispensable."12 A myth, in Kermode's sense but not in Frye's, is a fiction which has congealed be- cause the poet has forgotten that it is a fiction and proposes to put it into practice as if it were true. King Lear is a fiction, anti-Semitism is a myth. Kermode aptly quotes Sartre's obser- vation that "the final aim of art is to reclaim the world by revealing it as it is, but as if it had its source in human liberty." The "as ίΓ is the grace note that prevents a poet's fictions from becoming myths. The third constituent is clearly compatible with Frye and Kermode; it is a composite factor, a motive common to Ernst Bloch's The Spirit of Utopia and Herbert Marcuse's The Aes- thetic Dimension. Bloch defends modern art and literature by saying that they represent the future of mankind by express- ing mankind's desires, especially the desire for freedom. Bloch's work is a philosophy of hope, of futurity, of Utopia, a stirring of possibility. Marcuse is more specific. "By virtue of its aesthetic form," he maintains, "art is largely autonomous vis-a-vis the given social relations." Literature can be called revolutionary "only with reference to itself, as content having become form." Indeed, the political potential of art lies only in its own aesthetic dimension: its relation to praxis is inexorably indirect, mediated, and frustrating. Marcuse goes further to say something which must be a scandal to such readers as Deane and Jameson, that when the subjectivity of individuals is dissolved into class consciousness, a major prerequisite of revolution is minimized, namely, the fact that the need for 12 Frank Kermode, The Sense of an Ending (New York: Oxford University Press, 1967), p. 145.</page><page sequence="11">114 DENIS DONOGHUE radical change must be rooted in the subjectivity of individuals themselves. Marxist theory was mistaken, according to Mar- cuse, in interpreting subjectivity as a bourgeois notion: But even in bourgeois society, insistence on the truth and right of inwardness is not really a bourgeois value. With the affirmation of the inwardness of sub- jectivity, the individual steps out of the network of ex- change relationships and exchange values, withdraws from the reality of bourgeois society, and enters another dimension of existence. Liberating subjectivity constitutes itself in the inner history of the individuals - their own history, which is not iden- tical with their social existence. The scandal is not yet complete. Marcuse goes on to defend "art for art's sake11 "inasmuch as the aesthetic form reveals tabooed and repressed dimensions of reality: aspects of liberation." The domain of art is the freedom of inwardness and subjectivity. This freedom is not, Marcuse says, illusory, it is just as real as the public reality it contradicts. "Art breaks open a dimension inaccessible to other experience, a dimension in which human beings, nature, and things no longer stand under the law of the established reality principle." But this does not mean that the world according to art is a fantasy or an illusion; it is that of another 'reality principle', of estrangement "and only as estrangement does art fulfill a cognitive function: it communi- cates truths not communicable in any other language; it con- tradicts." When Marcuse encourages us to believe that "a work of art is authentic or true not by virtue of its content (i.e. the "cor- rect" representation of social conditions), nor by its 'pure* form, but by the content having become form",13 one is impelled to say to a politically-minded reader - Deane, Jameson, - that his reading is at best incomplete. Incomplete, unless it eventuates in an aesthetic judgment, a judgment of the particular work of 13 Herbert Marcuse, The Aesthetic Dimension (London: Macmillan, 1979), pp. ix, xii, 4, 19, 72, 10, 8.</page><page sequence="12">The Political Turn in Criticism 115 art as "content having become form". The only remaining constituent I see as necessary is a certain capacity in the reader: imagination. It is a sufficient justification of art that it enables us to imagine experiences which we have not had, and to participate in those experiences within the accepted limits of form. It offers us the possibility of complete knowledge of the work in question, by comparison with the partial knowledge which is the most we can practice in our ordinary lives. Is there a clear objection to this programme, apart from the obvious objection issuing from propagandists who lay violent hands upon the work of art on behalf of a political aim? The only one I have found is in Paul de Man's Introduction to Hans Robert Jauss's Toward an Aesthetics of Reception. As in his "Hegel on the Sublime", de Man repudiates "any valoriza- tion of aesthetic categories at the expense of intellectual rigor or political action, or any claim for the autonomy of aesthetic experience as a self-enclosed, self-reflexive totality."14 I am content with that; especially in a work of literature, where the saving commonness of language, the heterogeneity of every work, makes the dream of totality and self-enclosure absurd. In the Introduction to Jauss, de Man argues against any "con- catenation of the aesthetic with meaning-producing powers of language." The aesthetic, he says, is by definition a seductive notion "that appeals to the pleasure principle, a eudaemonic judgment that can displace and conceal values of truth and falsehood likely to be more resilient to desire than values of pleasure and pain." It is strange to find de Man saying this, since according to his normal view, all such values are merely different functions of language, they have no independent character. But in any case de Man brushes the aesthetic category aside; aesthetic reactions are interesting only as symptoms. "Whenever the aesthetic is invoked as an appeal to clarity and control, whenever, in other words, a symptom is made into a remedy for the disorder that it signals, a great deal of caution is in order." 14 Paul de Man: "Hegel on the Sublime": in Mark Krupnick (ed.), Displace- ments: Derrida and After (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1983), p. 141.</page><page sequence="13">116 DENIS DONOGHUE But de Man's idea of the aesthetic is specious. "It is im- possible to conceive of an aesthetic judgment that would not be dependent on imitation as a constitutive category," he claims. Why? Because the easiest notion of form is that of a visible ob- ject; and the easiest notion of cognition is the apprehension of such an object? De Man refers to "Hegel's massively misunderstood treatment of the aesthetic as a provisional (vorläufig, a word that also occurs in Benjamin) form of cogni- tion" and says that it is "entirely in the spirit of his con- tinuators Kierkegaard and Nietzsche." But it is not misunderstood if we relate it to the other activities I have in- voked as constituents of an aesthetic stance: provisional cogni- tion, nominal reason, the production of "consciously false" fictions, imagery of a future consonant with desire, and the an- tithetical cognitive function which Marcuse called estrange- ment or contradiction. VI I shall make a few remarks about "Ancestral Houses", since Deane has given it a distinctly ideological reading. Not that I think it a superior poem; by Yeats's standards, it is somewhat flaccid, and in that character best taken as the dis- pirited beginning of a series of meditations, in the last and best of which Yeats shakes himself out of a weary mood by thinking of "eyes that rage has brightened." It will be clear that Deane and I differ in our readings of the poem. Where he is scandal- ized by Yeats's movement from bad history to no-histoiy-at-all, I read the poem as expressing one of Yeats's recurrent moods, his worry that the next phase of history may not be the an- tithetical one he prophesied and longed for; it may continue to be the primary culture he partly despises, partly fears, the Christian culture of meekness, the common man, democracy. Great men, out of phase, may be brought low by the common herd. We have a poem in five stanzas, eight iambic pentameter lines each, end-rhyming strictly in the sequence abababcc. 16 Paul de Man, The Resistance to Theory (Minneapolis: University of Min- nesota Press, 1986), pp. 64, 66.</page><page sequence="14">The Political Turn in CHticism 117 Each stanza coincides with a long, complex sentence, although a repeated phrase at the beginning of the second - "Mere dreams, mere dreams!" - postpones its sentence for a moment. It is possible to follow Harold Bloom in taking the poem as sar- donic on the whole, as if Yeats were scorning the aristocrats for not holding on to their possessions. But that interpretation ig- nores the degree to which Yeats recognizes the satisfactions - the sweetness, the gentleness - which also mark the defeat of once-great men. The first stanza invokes the familiar Romantic contrast between organic and mechanic form. The distinction is most readily found in Coleridge, but its imagery comes from Shelley and Blake; from Shelley, to whom water was the great symbol of existence, according to Yeats's "The Philosophy of Shelley's Poetry"; and from Blake, who says in The Marriage of Heaven and Hell that "the cistern contains: the fountain overflows." In "The Philosophy of Shelley's Poetry", again, Yeats refers to Blake, "who was always praising energy, and all exalted over- flowing of oneself." It is decent of Yeats to ascribe to the rich man the powers to be admired: at least he doesn't suggest that anyone might have them merely by taking thought. The stanza is a reply to Yeats's "Adam's Curse"; it makes no bones about the exhilarating conjunction of power, inherited property, and genius, as if it might stave off the inevitable decay of beauty and other proud forms of achievement. The second stanza begins with the most rueful conces- sion - "Mere dreams..." - but it sets it aside at once by invoking Homer, Yeats's type of another conjunction, that of genius and the natural or unchristened heart, the poet of life itself with nothing but its own conviction in its favor. This stanza con- tains the first crisis; the fountain of life becomes "the abound- ing jet", but it then given up, as if Homer were now defeated. The proper symbol, Yeats admits, is the "marvelous empty sea- shell." In The Island of Statues Colin addresses the shepherd boy: Who art thou? - speak, As the sea's furrows on a sea-tost shell, Sad histories are lettered on thy cheek.</page><page sequence="15">118 DENIS DONOGHUE The sea-shell has been flung "out of the obscure dark of the rich streams", so it can speak with authority of everything it has been through, but now it can only recite its sad history, shadowing "the inherited glory of the rich." This stanza goes back not only to the worn shell of "Adam's Curse" but to every instance of greatness brought down. In the third stanza, Yeats celebrates the Renaissance princes and the artists and architects they employed, and here a major disjunction is recognized, between the artists, "bitter and violent men", and the sweetness and gentleness of their creations. In "Ego Dominus Tuus" and Per Arnica Silentia Lunae Yeats is fascinated by artists whose works are entirely different from themselves, by William Morris and by Landor, the latter a man of notable violence who "topped us all in calm nobility when the pen was in his hand." Or in the version of Landor which Yeats gives in A Vision: "The most violent of men, he uses his intellect to disengage a visionary image of perfect sanity... seen always in the most serene and classic art imaginable." This third stanza contains another crisis: a violent artist may produce works of surpassing gentleness, and satisfy that in us which longs to be appeased, but his master's power, in a generation or two, may lapse, his descendants decline into mice; it is a theme of several poems, including the next medita- tion of the sequence, and Purgatory. The fourth and fifth stanzas brood upon the same fear, that these works of grace and beauty may domesticate our greatness as thoroughly as our violence and bitterness. The beauty Yeats celebrates is that of women, the gardens where they walk, their patron Juno: Ο what if gardens where the peacock strays With delicate feet upon old terraces, Or else all Juno from an urn displays Before the indifferent garden deities; 16 W.B. Yeats, A Vision (London: Macmillan, 1962), pp. 144-5.</page><page sequence="16">The Political Turn in Críticism 119 (I assume a "that" after "all"; meaning all the beauty and high spiritedness that the figure of Juno displays, attended by the peacocks sacred to her.) The sentence has to wait through three rather slack clauses before finding its verb, "take", in the last line; it is an extravagance of suspended revery, repeated with somewhat less risk to the grammar in the final stanza which anticipates a similar revery in "To Dorothy Wellesley". These beautiful women were always a danger to Yeats's syn- tax. It is a well-recognized mark of Yeats's rhetorical power that it can turn into terms of praise many words normally held for rebuke: violent, bitter, haughty, and in many societies "rich". Much of this effect is achieved in "Ancestral Houses" by setting up a concatenation of values which go together only when compelled to do so; the attachment of "life", the Blakeian imagery of flowing fountains, and the greatness commonly ascribed, in Pound as in Yeats, to Renaissance patrons of the arts who happened otherwise to be monsters. Yeats's word "greatness" forces us to acknowledge this concatenation as a single force, even though we would ordinarily want to distin- guish its constituents along an unYeatsian system of values. Andrew Marvell's "Horatian Ode on Cromwell's Return from Ireland" makes it similarly difficult to dissent from the values he celebrates: active virtue - another equivocation - is ascribed to Cromwell, only aesthetic decorum to the defeated Charles. Deane's reading of "Ancestral Houses" errs in two respects: it maintains that the poem takes leave of history or myth, and that it becomes meaningful only as an aspect of the "human condition". In fact, the poem doesn't even take leave of history; it refers vaguely but clearly enough to eighteenth cen- tury accomplishment - "a haughtier age" points in that direc- tion, though there is no need to assume that Yeats meant Ascendancy Ireland, even though in "Blood and the Moon" the haughty man praised is Burke. The theme is the alleged decline of culture between the Augustan age and our own: the anomaly which gives the poem whatever life it has is the fact that the images which please our passivity are those, now long domesticated, which we have inherited from great and violent men.</page><page sequence="17">120 DENIS DONOGHUE More thoroughly than most other poets, Yeats knew that a vocabulary, a diction, incorporates a totalizing ambition. When we bring together a few cognate words, they think their kinship so compelling that they preen themselves and set out to take over the world. So much so, that by apt choice and repetition of such words it is easy to convey a conviction that this way of construing the world is ordained by natural law. Yeats recited his high words so imperiously that his poems nearly prescribe a way of being in the world; like a cavaliy of- ficer, assured of rank, dignity, and power. The experience of reading any of these central poems is one of imagining a world other than one's own, and assenting to it at least provisionally, and holding back from it, swaying while the reading lasts be- tween assent and refusal. If Jameson retorts that such an ex- perience merely gulls the reader into thinking that he is acting out his freedom in the presence of the poem, I would defend the reader's freedom precisely by not claiming that it is absolute. It is a conditional felicity, and I would reduce every extravagant claim made on its behalf and then speak up for the value as so reduced. As for the "human condition": it is a reasonable merit to ask of a poem that it spill over from its local circumstances and speak of the universal fate of being human. We value Donne's poems, and Shakespeare's, and Hardy's because, whatever the local circumstances which provoked them, they transcend that origin and speak beyond their occasion. Besides, to read "An- cestral Houses" uninvidiously, which on the present occasion means unideologically, it is only necessary to imagine what it would be like to be different, to feel differently, to have the ex- perience of living by another system of values, according to which it would not be sufficient to deem Yeats's word "great- ness" to amount to nothing more than monstrous behaviors. Once we receive it as an imagined experience, we are free to discard every piece of merely local evidence in its favor: it is not necessary to remain infatuated with the greatness of a Renaissance prince. Deane's reading of the poem, like Jameson's reading of Ulysses, would ensure that these works are never read but censored in advance.</page><page sequence="18">The Political Turn in CHticism 121 VII I revert to the dispute between Ransom and Blackmur, and remark that Ransom thought it serious enough to conclude it by saying that "there are substantive as well as formal values11 in a poem, just as in a novel where their existence is generally admitted. Ransom did not mention that in writing about T.S. Eliot's criticism, Blackmur had been more specific in defining the several relations between thought, experience, belief, feeling, and emotion; so that in Eliot's context rather than in Yeats's, Blackmur's notion of "doctrine presented as emotion" becomes clear. It is hardly surprising that Blackmur ascribed to Eliot a programme much the same as his own. What Eliot did was simple, according to Blackmur: "he ex- cluded thought as such from poetry and said that poetry dealt with the experience or feeling of thought which might or might not - probably not - have been the poet's thought; and similar- ly he said that poetiy dealt with belief as the experience or feeling of belief which probably had to be, from the nature of belief, the poet's own belief." A page or two later Blackmur gave working definitions of feeling and emotion. Feeling "is the fundamental term: concrete, sensory, nuclear, somehow in ex- perience, whether actual or imagined, always particular." Emotion is "feelings organized by a force whether within or without the psyche: emotion is feelings, organized, generalized, abstracted, built into a form, theoretic or not." Ad libbing be- tween the words, we can say that doctrine presented as emo- tion may be translated now to read: an apparently systematic body of ideas, presented so far as they are feelings, which in superior poems is far enough. The feelings in the case are suffi- ciently organized, the writing of the poem is the mode of or- ganizing them within the constraints of language. Otherwise put in Blackmur's terms: emotion is the theoretic form of feel- ings which, lacking that form, are disordered and personal beyond communicative redemption. Blackmur says of the 17 R. P. Blackmur, The Lion and the Honeycomb (London: Methuen, 1956), pp. 169, 172.</page><page sequence="19">122 DENIS DONOGHUE theoretic form, the emotion, that it is good only in that in- stance; which I take to mean that the defect of an idea is that it claims to be good in any and every instance. This is Deane's error, and Jameson's; that having arrived at an idea - a politi- cal stance, a position which can only be reasserted since its his- tory as an idea is already complete - they insist on its being good in every instance. So the question to ask about "Ancestral Houses" is not: do I find its political attitude congenial? but rather: am I willing to read it, and to let it at least provisionally read me? If I am willing to read it in that spirit, I suspend for the time being not my disbelief but my economy, the nearly automatic disposi- tions of attitude I for the most part practice. It is vain to read a poem unless we are on every occasion willing to ask ourselves: what would it be like to be different?. The best reader is not the one who murmurs to himself, "Thave seen what I have seen, see what I see!", but the one who says to the poem: "Help me to feel what you have felt."</page></plain_text>
