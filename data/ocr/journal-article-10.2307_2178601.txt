A physical law is immediately conditioned on a given ensemble of factual circumstances, but reduces finally to an unconditional law. Thus a piece of wood floats in water and sinks in air in obedience to the same law of gravitation. A moral law is similarly conditioned by custom, and it is worth while to inquire whether there is also an unconditional law above custom, and if so, what it is. The striking fact of psychic growth in connection with the development of the value scale is the progressive unification and organization of the mental life. Value is for the child mere blind impulse, or inheres only in momentary pleasures or pains. With the apprehension of causation comes that of a new kind of value called utility; with further abstraction, truth becomes a value, and complete self-consciousness brings appreciation of activity and liberty. A will presupposes unification of psychic activities. But a higher unity is progressively perfected at the same time, that of the plurality of subjects in society. Here morality first appears. This spiritual unity, or common human nature, the realization of which by each is conditioned upon its realization by all other subjects, is the unconditional moral law beyond custom. But the unity is never an identity; subjects remain individual and always in a way opposed. And in this opposition consists the vital energy of the human world, and the possibility of progress. The opposition is permanent; it cannot even be called a harmony in the sentimental or mystical sense; it is moral evil. We involuntarily think of the elimination of evil as being a good, but we should recognize that it would mean the elimination of life at the same time. F. H. KNIGHT. Les conditions generates de la connaissance. F. PAULHAN. Rev. Phil., XXXIX, 6, PP. 53i-6io. Some theory of knowledge is indispensable to all philosophy; to pass over it is only an easy way of assuming one without discussion. This branch of 58i</page><page sequence="2">582 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. inquiry has been dominated by the opposition of subject and object, and the present article is an examination of this opposition and an attempt to determine its meaning and bearing. Pure objectivism (naive realism) and pure sub- jectivism (subjective idealism) have both found numerous defenders; but neither position can be maintained except by refusing to see its objections, and it is little better with the compromise attempted by the theory of relativity. Philosophers have neglected to state explicitly the obvious question of epis- temology as to how we know knowledge itself. Since knowledge involves subject and object, the act of knowledge can only become an object of knowl- edge on condition that the subject is viewed as an object. On the other hand, objects are in a sense subjectively perceived, since thinkers agree that we are immediately aware of only psychic facts. Hence the act of knowing is at the same time an objectification of a subject and subjectification of an object. The apparent confusion involved leads to many difficulties. It is said that the subject known as object is no longer the knowing subject, and again, that the object is falsified in its assimilation to the subject. This would seem to make valid knowledge impossible. The pragmatic solution of the problem is the- oretically tenable, but men refuse to remain consistent pragmatists, and insist on regarding intelligence as a function of knowing truth. The problem is further complicated by the consideration that the subject which knows is also the subject which feels, appreciates, evaluates. The two operations are apparently independent, truth and value affecting each other little or not at all. Yet they are inseparable, for a value is after all a fact, and truth is also a value, which may take precedence of and dominate all other values. The history of the development of the mind adds further interesting considerations. With the growth of self-consciousness, the object becomes more definite and clear, and intelligent action replaces instinctive or emotional. Before this process even becomes complete, however, it is reversed, and unconscious automatism progressively replaces intelligence. The object and subject may be regarded as both real, but unknowable separately, while the subject as subject is unknow- able in any sense. The correspondence of knowledge with reality is condi- tioned upon and proportional to an inherent similarity of the knowing and the known, so that neither is distorted by their mutual assimilation. The intellect, it must be remembered, has two functions; it serves to direct action as well as to know truth; which of these is to be regarded as paramount seems to be a matter of individual temperament. We must also attribute to it a creative function, thus finding place for the idees-forces of Fouillee. And finally, it manifests a tendency to disappear after reaching a maximum development, in accordance with a law of evanescence. F. H. KNIGHT. Psychische Kausalftat und Willensakt. E. BLEULER. Z. f. Psych., LXIX, I u. 2, PP. 30-72. The view that psychology is opposed to other sciences in that it deals with subjects and not with objects, is an erroneous one. Psychology must in any</page><page sequence="3">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 583 case deal to a large extent with the objective world, while it can practically dispense with introspection without any vital loss in value. Moreover, the subjective psychologist in eliminating outward observation is too apt to omit inner observation also, and succumb to the attractions of a deductive psychol- ogy. Results of such thinking have little scientific worth because the concepts from which deductions are drawn are too indefinite. This is the fatal weakness of Volkmar and the 'philosophical' psychologists. It is futile, again, to attempt to rule out animal psychology, which must be purely objective, and the same must be said of the study of any human subject other than one's self. Words describing subjective states are objective reactions as much as are mechanical motions. There are still people who maintain the theory of psycho-physical parallelism, but all are forced in practice to assume the dependence of mind (Psyche) on brain function. The relation between con- sciousness and brain function is significant for epistemology, but for scientific psychology it is now quite meaningless. The true subject-matter of any scientific psychology is the whole plastic reaction of the central nervous system. That is, in general, in man, the activity of the cerebral cortex; but no definite line can be drawn between merely-nervous and also-psychical function. An assumption equally erroneous with that of the peculiar character of psychology as to subject-matter is that it may be distinguished from physical sciences by the kind of causation manifested. The alleged gaps in the causal sequence of psychic phenomena are due simply to the false and artificial limitation of the field of observation. We could not expect to explain the form of a water wave from that of previous ones without taking the general surroundings into account. So also with the supposed lack of proportion between cause and effect in the psychic field. Psychic causes are of the energy-releasing, not the direct mechanical type, and the former are dominant in the whole field of biology, while as common as the latter in the physical world itself. We properly call a spark the cause of an explosion, but we would scarcely attempt to correlate the quantities of energy involved in the two. The most useful analogue for understanding psychic processes in their causal relation seems to be that of 'switching' in electrical contrivances. The most diverse and com- plex reactions can be made intelligible and simple by this comparison. The switching is not of course to be thought of as a direct connection and dis- connection of conductors, but rather a cutting in and out of variable resistances in different paths. The switching concept is particularly useful in cases where a selection is to be made between conflicting impulses or stimuli to different kinds of action; i. e., in phenomena of will. A true act of will pre- supposes some kind of personality, however primitive, an organized striving or generalized tendency in action, more than the sum of individual impulses. The will is the resultant (not the sum) of all the centrifugal tendencies which lie in the affective states (Affekten), or it is the centrifugal side of the resultant "Gesamptaffekt." The dominant impulse 'switches in' the corresponding course of action, present or future, and 'switches out' all others. This general view of the will is frankly deterministic, but not therefore contradictory to the</page><page sequence="4">584 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. concept of freedom in any practically significant sense. The 'willed' course of action is to be sure that prompted by the 'strongest' motive, because that is the way we define 'strongest'; but it is the motive of the whole person, not an individual impulse. Nor is this procedure at all peculiar to psychology; in no other field have we any means of measuring forces except by their effects. F. H. KNIGHT. The Need for a Modern Casuistry. H. L. STEWART. Inter. J. of Ethics, XXIV, No. 4, pp. 379-40I. This article is a refutation of Mr. F. H. Bradley's attack upon Casuistry in his Principles of Logic, pp. 247ff. The author shows the unreliableness of Mr. Bradley's assumptions upon which his attack was based in that there are cases of genuine moral perplexity, and the intuitions of conscience are not always clear and adequate. As examples of these 'questionable' cases we may take the feminist movement, the question of suffrage, the reciprocal relations of employers and employees, the limits of state interference with the freedom of action of the individual, sexual and family relationships, etc. These questions can not be solved apart from moral considerations. They are all moral questions, but who can lay down general rules for their solution? The verdict of conscience seems self-contradictory, for both sides of these questions are upheld conscientiously. The study of ethical principles does not make a person moral, but if any conflict arises in his moral intuitions, a study of such principles may be of great benefit to him. Moral philosophy ought to help one to settle disputed moral questions. We need an expert who gives his life to just such a field. His decisions would not be merely authoritative; they would suggest solutions to the individual in trouble. For over two thousand years moral philosophers have busied themselves with such questions of morality as have very seldom, if ever, been disputed by the common man. Now let them turn their attention to the unravelling of real moral difficulties, for which assistance the unlearned man will be exceedingly grateful. HENRY BENTSON. Casuistry and Ethics. G. A. JOHNSTON. Inter. J. of Ethics, XXIV, No. 4, Pp. 40I-418. The prejudice against casuistry is well nigh universal. The popular pre- judice is one of those unexamined presuppositions which infect all our thought with error. It is due partly to the aversion of the popular mind to everything exact, codified and systematized, partly to the mistaken belief that casuistry means Romanist casuistry, and partly to the moral laxity which has often accompanied it, but which is not an essential element in it. Philosophers have opposed casuistry because they believe that in moral questions, "reflection is a symptom of disease "; but this would condemn all ethics. Again, it is objected that a system of casuistry is impossible because no two cases are exactly alike; but this may be said of all science. There is enough similarity between</page><page sequence="5">No. 5.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 585 situations and conditions to warrant the existence of such a system. Bradley believes that it perverts ethics into an art of morality instead of permitting it to remain a purely theoretical science. But why must we have either a theoretical science or a perversion of ethics, an art of morality? Why not have both? There are two disciplines or sciences, ethics and casuistry, which deal with morality. They are not independent of each other; the latter is dependent upon the former. Ethics is a purely theoretical science which deals with general, abstract principles and is exact, while casuistry is a practical science which deals with inherited principles and is inexact. The principles of ethics are universal and absolute, but those of casuistry are mere general rules affected by and allowing for circumstances and conditions. These casuistic principles and rules must not be at variance with the purely ethical principles. Casuistry is the application of the general rule to the particular case, and especially the application of ethical principles to specific, perplex- ing problems of conduct. The present article is introductory to a subsequent one in which the author proposes to outline his own system. HENRY BENTSON. A Definition of Causation. IV: W. H. SHELDON. J. of Phil., Psy., and Sci. Meth., Vol. XI, No. 14, PP. 365-377. This is the last of four articles on the nature of causation. An examination of the phenomena investigated by physics shows that all instances of causation are of two types: the composition type and the serial type, which ultimately reduce to one type, the unending, self-repeating series. All cases of causation have this common logical structure. The necessary and sufficient condition of the series is two terms in a relation of sameness and difference; the second is another case of the first with added differences. The first term is more fundamental than the second, because it precedes the second temporally and logically, defines the second, and can exist without the second. The past has an existential rank higher than that of the future; the tendency of an event is "in one certain direction," from higher to lower levels. Yet the series is impossible without the second term, for the first by itself is mere potentiality. Every cause is a potentiality plus a motion or change. The series contains necessity. Given these two related terms, and the effect, a never finished series, " of necessity and pure deduction " follows; each term implies indefinitely another case of itself. Events are necessitated by their causes; so far as there is causation, "nature deduces itself from the past." This, however, does not preclude indeterminate beginnings, which allow the universe to grow by adding new, unending series to its content. This discovery of the "objective existence of necessary connection " is the result of an empirical investigation of the con- tent of experience. It enables us to answer Hume without having to resort to such hypotheses as the independent " subsistence " of universals or the presence of mind as a law-giver imposing its forms on nature. Although each term and relation of the series is particular, the concept of the universal may be derived from this system of two particular terms in a particular relation. The neces-</page><page sequence="6">586 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. sity is not an absolute or an a priori necessity, but one derived from the existence of a "dyadic relation." No necessity can be derived from one term alone. Hume failed to find a "necessary connection," because he did not define " necessary connection," did not examine specific cases of causation, and treated a cause as "one" instead of "two." RAYMOND P. HAWES. A Definition of Value. RALPH BARTON PERRY. J. of Phil., Psy. &amp; Sci. Meth., XI, 6, pp. 14i-i62. This article is written for the purpose of opening up the subject for discus- sion. In it the author does not give any extended treatment of his own views; it is rather a presentation and criticism of the views held by Moore, Russell, Urban, Sheldon, Brentano, Sidgwick and Santayana, together with some stray remarks that indicate the author's own point of view. The way in which to arrive at a true definition of values is to study the particular instances, realizing however, that an instance can be no more than an approximation to the goal. Value is not indefinable nor unanalyzable for this would supplement an in- definable good with an indefinable evil. Then too, these indefinables give so little account of themselves that the phenomenon of the appearance and dis- appearance, the waxing and waning of values, is left totally unexplained. And finally, this doctrine of indefinability is objectionable, because it is so easy to mistake the simplicity of our own knowledge for a simplicity in the object. Value does not consist in harmony or fitness, for a thing may be 'fit' for the rubbish heap and yet be valueless. Neither can goodness be said to be identical with the formal relationship of a particular to its universal, that is,the realization of a type; for the worst specimen of a man may be the most perfect specimen of inebriety or simplemindedness. The hedonistic view of value is too narrow, for it does not take account of all of our experiences. The present day view is that value, in the generic sense, has to do with a certain constant that we may call bias or interest. The justification of this view lies in the fact that bias or interest, with its manifold varieties, conditions, and relations, affords the best means of systematically describing the region of our world which the value sciences and value vocabulary roughly denote. It is broad enough to contain a host of divergent views. Some maintain that satisfaction of interest as such is value, others deny it utterly, and still others qualify it. To the first class the author belongs. He holds that interest is not an immediate cognition of value qualities in its object, but is a mode of the organism, enacted, sensed, or possibly felt, and qualifying the object through being a response to it. To like or dislike an object is to create that object's value. To be aware that one likes or dislikes an object is to cognize that object's value. HENRY BENTSON. What is Religious Knowledge? C. DELISLE BURNS. Int. Jr. of Ethics, XXIV, No. 3, pp. 253-265. In the past, knowledge which seemed vital to us was called religious. This article proposes to show that only one kind of knowledge is possible, that the</page><page sequence="7">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 587 antithesis of religious and scientific knowledge rests on a mistake. It will trace the origin of the mistake and show how the antithesis came into being. Lastly it will be shown that the mistake was recognized as such through the discovery of history. Unreasonable moderation toward religious dogmas has led to the mistaken idea that there can be two kinds of truth, one to supply our emotional and the other our intellectual needs. Religious knowledge does not differ in kind from scientific knowledge. In two points religious knowledge is more effective in influencing character. Religious knowledge is more systematized and more poetically expressed; it is weak, however, in the dogmatism of its statements where there is not evidence enough to support the conclusion. " If we are still to speak of religious knowledge, this last tendency must be eliminated, and its place supplied by the courage which dares to acknowledge ignorance." C. M. HOBART. Social Progress and Religious Faith. EUGENE W. LYMAN. Harvard Theol. Rev., VII, No. 2, Pp. I39-i65. Social progress and religious faith are often regarded as being in a semi- unfriendly relation. This view is due in the first place to the notion that religion is inherently conservative and for this reason may be obstructive. It is due in the second place to the idea that religion, since it is a relation be- tween the soul and God, is necessarily individual. Contrary to this attitude, the writer holds that religious faith at its best is a powerful force for social progress. The earliest and most striking evidence is to be found in prophetic religion. The prophet furnishes a practical ideal for us all-a man of the highest character and clearest faith. The prophet's ideal aimed at securing righteous and humane social relations. His life with God could not hold him apart from service to men. The constructive purpose of the prophet finds ex- pression in his ideal of the kingdom of God. Jesus universalized this ideal by making the entrance conditions not political but moral. Jesus in universalizing the religious consciousness kept together the sense of God and the social goal. The full measure of this union can not be learned merely from his teaching; His life and deeds portray the union in its most perfect form. The union of social progress and religious faith is found also in modern religious life. The development of liberal Christianity is a case in point. Missionary education is undoubtedly social in its consequences. When individual experience of religion seems to become sufficient unto itself, then the fullest and deepest meaning of religion is slipping away. The deepest experience of God is found in sharing in the work of social progress for the realization of His Kingdom. Thus religion is an active relation with the working God in His effort for social progress. God himself is actively in the midst of our social relations. The purpose of religion is to make the soul alert, resourceful, inventive. Its purest essence is found in originality and creativeness in the moral and spiritual order. This essence of religion finds expression in the promotion of social progress. Social progress needs personal religion and that intensive interest</page><page sequence="8">588 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. in the individual soul which personal religion only can bring about. The appreciation of the preciousness of personality and of the need of its full development is the only adequate motive for social endeavor. C. M. HOBART. Ethics as a Science. CHARLES W. SUPER. Int. Jr. of Ethics, XXIV, No. 3, pp. 265-28I. This article proposes to examine the claim of moral science to be equal in rank with any other science except mathematics. Any department of human knowledge may be made a science if its data can be formulated in the causal relation. The existence of innate ethical ideas must be admitted. Every com- munity of men always contains some individuals who recognize the binding force of an obligation. The earliest as well as the latest Hebrew prophets were vehement preachers of righteousness, and moral sentiments may likewise be found in Hesiod's Works and Days. A regular system of moral instruction based on the principles laid down in the Sacred Writings was begun with the organization of Christian communites. In spite of this system, poverty and its accompanying immorality continued to furnish the most perplexing problems with which governments had to contend. This was due mainly to the un- scientific measures adopted for suppressing them. By means of scientific methods morality has been greatly advanced. Experience has proved that morality is largely dependent on economic conditions. A striking example of the use of science in the moral sphere is shown in the temperance movement. Science has promoted morality also in the domain of warfare. Observation and experimentation are the two foundation principles of every science. Science in its relation to physical man is indebted more to Hippocrates than to any other Greek thinker. "The scientist points the way; the moral reformer walks in it and induces others to follow him. The measure of mutual friendliness with which they cooperate is the measure of social and ethical progress. " C. M. HOBART. The Mental and the Physical. HOWARD C. WARREN. Psy. Rev., XXI, 2, PP. 79-IOO. The relation of mind and body is the Wandering Jew of science. This paper will show that the most satisfactory explanation of this relation is the double- aspect view, that this explanation enables us to treat the objective data of psychology from a mechanistic standpoint; also that it leads to a two-aspect psychology-a psychology of introspection and of behavior. This explanation has suffered from the lack of a suitable analogy. The surface-mass relation of matter is analogous to the mind-body relation. Conscious activity and ner- vous activity are neither causally related nor parallel. They constitute one process which may be observed in two ways. This theory adds simplicity to the genetic problem of consciousness, for we can assume that consciousness pervades the whole organic world. In Biology the debate is between mechan-</page><page sequence="9">No. 5.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 589 ism and vitalism. The present evidence justifies the mechanistic interpreta- tion. Psychology should assume the same attitude toward the phenomenon of choice. This interpretation changes the ethical concept of responsibility. Ethics should concern itself with the sense of responsibility which mankind actually possesses. The genesis and activity of purpose are explicable on mechanistic grounds. The difficulty has been that the philosopher, the biologist, and the common man have retained the anthropomorphic psychology of early times. Psychology has been too much dominated by introspective analysis. Introspection needs objective checking; such objective methods are essential to genetic investigation. Animal psychology is hindered rather than helped by introspection. We must study behavior. Behavior reveals the dynamic aspect best. Introspection also is a field for exact investigation. In this field modern psychology has yielded many worthy scientific results. The double aspect view would prefer to treat conscious processes and behavior processes as branches of one science. From this viewpoint, psychology might be defined as the science of the individual organism or consciousness as related to its environment. C. M. HOBART. Les idees directrices de la logique genetique des mathemmatiques. A. R. SCHWEIT- ZER. Rev. de Met., XXII, 2, pp. I74-I96. Two fundamentally different conceptions of the logic of mathematics are represented in the treatments of B. Russell and C. S. Peirce respectively. The former proceeds in conformity with his idea of inference, which reduces all reasoning to deduction and views induction as merely a method of making plausible conjectures, and so views mathematics as purely objective. Peirce, on the other hand, finds room for the genetic phase, for mathematics as a mental activity as well as an existence. The present discussion is methodo- logical, and is concerned with mathematics as a science of discovery, and in particular with the use of the "working hypothesis" in this field. A working hypothesis, or idee directrice is essentially a mediator between two terms in disaccord, which is also the final form of other logical problems and their solutions. Mathematicians have been reluctant to admit the working hy- pothesis in pure mathematics, to recognize that their science is in one aspect a science of observation. Hence the formal elements of problems,-terms in disaccord and mediating idea,-are not often recognized in mathematical discussions. These elements are always present, however, and their recogni- tion is becoming more and more explicit. E. H. Moore was the first to give them clear expression. The mediating concept corresponds, too, to the leitende Idee of Grassmann. In general terms, the problem is that of the discovery of relations, and the various logical conceptions of the nature of relations in the works of thinkers generally shed light on the issues involved. There is always a close relation between the mediating idea and some value, a fact which has been especially emphasized by James and the pragmatists, though clearly stated by Mill. The method of mediation must depend in large</page><page sequence="10">590 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXIII. measure on the purpose to be served by relating the terms in disaccord. The discussion leads to the conclusion that the mediating concepts of mathematics are ultimately the same as those of other disciplines. The most important ones to be noted are the Principles of Comparison, of Continuance, of Economy of Thought, and of Special Situation,-the last more especially mathematical in character. All reduce ultimately to the principle of comparison. F. H. KNIGHT. Le socialism de Fichte d'apres l'Etat commercial ferme. X. LEoN. Rev. de Met., XXII, 2, pp. 197-220. Fichte's " Closed Commercial State " is first of all a protest against mercantil- ism. It regards the balance-of-trade ideal as based on the love of gold for its own sake, which is the arch corruptor of states as well as individuals. Fichte's great ideal was liberty; but he saw that perfect economic freedom would lead to the worst oppression, to civil war and probably to the establishment of tyranny. Hence his aim was to incorporate individuals in an organic society where their liberties would not conflict but would be ordered in harmony, and where moreover, the moral personality might find fullest expression. To assure to all the means of subsistence and enable them to participate in the higher life of the spirit, was the lofty ideal of his socialism; and the dignity of personality and respect for moral values shine forth from nearly every page of his book. A careful investigation shows good reason for believing that Fichte was directly influenced by the socialistic propaganda of Babeuf and the course of events accompanying the French Revolution. There is a remarkable parallelism between the theories of Fichte and those announced before him by Babeuf in regard to money, the regulation of commerce and the general administration of the ideal state; while the publication in Germany of numerous letters from Germans living in Paris at the time, gave him abundant means of becoming conversant with the latter's doctrines. Babeuf, however, was communistic in his equalitarianism, Fichte strongly individualistic; Babeuf was interested in the happiness of the people, Fichte in their spiritual life. The most striking evidence of French influence is found in Fichte's adoption of the "natural boundaries" idea which was the slogan of the revolutionary leaders. The economic changes incident to the Revolution and the legislative measures which the Convention was constrained to take to meet the new condi- tions also shed much light on the growth and the influence of the theories of Babeuf and Fichte. It would be going too far to call Fichte the precursor of modern German socialism. At any rate, he foreshadowed rather the bureau- cratic, paternalistic "state-socialism" of Bismarck than the internationalism of the Marxians. F. H. KNIGHT. On the Nature of Acquaintance. BERTRAND RUSSELL. The Monist, XXIV, 2, pp. i6i-i87. This article is the second of a series that appears under the above title. It is a criticism of the later philosophical point of view of James and of Mach,</page><page sequence="11">No. 5.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 59I which is here called Neutral Monism. Neutral monism is the theory that the things commonly regarded as mental and the things commonly regarded as physical do not differ in respect of any intrinsic property possessed by the one set and not by the other, but only in respect of arrangement and context. Ideas are not mental duplicates of the physical order; they are identical with it, but considered in its mental context. The word consciousness does not stand for an entity but rather for a function; it connotes a kind of external relation and does not denote a special stuff or way of being. There is only one primal stuff or material in the world, and we call this pure experience. Thus knowing can be explained as a particular sort of relation towards one another into which portions of pure experience may enter. Knowing is an external relation between two bits of experience, consisting in the fact that one of them leads to the other by means of certain intermediaries. An experience may know itself in certain circumstances. The knower and the known are either (i) the selfsame piece of experience taken twice over in different contexts; or they are (2) two pieces of actual experience belonging to the same subject, with definite tracts of conjunctive transitional experience between them; or (3) the known is a possible experience either of that subject or another, to which the said conjunctive transitional would lead, if sufficiently prolonged. Against this theory the author urges four chief objections (a fifth will appear in the next article). He shows that the theory is a protest against the view that external objects are known through the medium of subjective "ideas" or "images"; not directly, but in the sense at least that whatever I experience, must be part of my mind. His objections are: i. That between for instance a color seen and the same not seen, there seems to be a difference not consisting in relations to other colors, or to other objects of experience, or to the nervous system, but in some way more immediate, more intuitively known. This would make a mind of only one experience a logical impossibility. Further- more, this philosophy can not define the respect in which the whole of my experience is different from the things that lie outside of my experience. 2. The theory assimilates belief and judgment to sensation and presentation which when applied to error makes it " belief in the unreal," or admission of the existence of unreal things, which is a contradiction. 3. The thought of what is not in time, or a belief in a non-temporal fact, is an event in time with a definite date, which seems impossible unless it contains some constituent over and above the timeless thing thought of or believed. 4. It refuses to regard immediate experience as knowledge. It speaks of knowledge as consisting in the presence of other things capable of leading to the thing which these other things are said to know. It is knowledge of things rather than of truths, and the knowledge of things is really a knowledge of propositions in which the object is not even a constituent. HENRY BENTSON.</page></plain_text>
