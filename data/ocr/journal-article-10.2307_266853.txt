Editors have dif- fered as to the punctuation of the list and as to the number of separate dances which are here mentioned. For the purposes of this paper we shall look particularly at the two words OpaKLoS and KOXacpLtapoS. Some translators and commentators have treated each of these words as refer- ring to a separate dance-e.g., the trans- lator of the Bohn Athenaeus (C. D. Yonge, The Deipnosophists, or Banquet of the Learned, of Athenaeus [London: Bohn, 1854], III, 1004) says: ". . . . the Thraci- an, the Calabrismus, the Telesias." Others have taken the two words together-e.g., F. A. Wright (The Arts in Greece [London: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1923], p. 29): "...... a Thracian dance called the Cola- brismos." Still others have attempted to translate KoXcq3pix,uo6.1 Since it could be derived from a word KO4Xapog, defined by some as "little pig," Charles B. Gulick (Athenaeus, the Deipnosophists [London: Heinemann; Cambridge: Harvard Uni- versity Press, 1930-37], VI, 395) renders t A later sectionl of tllis article is devoted to this problem. All anicient references to words fioni wiich the name of tile dance miglht have been derived are given there. the two words as "the Thracian pig- dance. " KoXac3pol appears in Athenaeus (iv. 164 e; xv. 697 c), where the context shows it must have the meaning "lascivious verses" or the like. This suggests another interpretation of KoXaptpLao-6, a rather obvious one, which, however, the com- mentators seem not to have noticed. One might easily think of the dance accom- panying such verses as a sort of KW/IOS, a development of primitive ritualistic ob- scenity of a type familiar in Athens and in other parts of Greece proper. Pollux (iv. 100) also refers to the dance. KoXac3pLtupos Opa4KLov 6`px&gt;,ua Kact KapLKov, he says, sustaining the editors, who unite the two words. He continues: -1v OE Ka' ToTro voirXtov. This addition complicates the situation considerably. If the dance was a "pig dance," why and how was it done in armor? In the main, Pollux and Athenaeus, when discussing the dance, stem from the same sources. Accordingly, it is just barely possible that Pollux, in the latter part of his comment, has inadvertently confused, or designedly associated, the KoXc4ptayow with the TCXEo-cig, which follows it in the list as Athenaeus gives it. The TEXEGLta' was certainly an armed dance (cf. Athen. xiv. 630 a). Furthermore, armed dances were characteristic of the Thracians (Athen. i. 15 e; Xenophon Anab. vi. 1. 5-6). Are we, then, dealing with a Thracian dance, a "pig" dance, a dance in armor, a KC/,IO3 performed to obscene verses, or a combination of some, or even all, oL these elements? Some further clai-ilication of [CLASSICAL PHILOLOGY, XL, APRIL, 194..]</page><page sequence="2">THE "THRACIAN PIG DANCE" 99 the nature of the dance may be derived from linguistic or archeological evidence. The linguistic evidence is, unfortunate- ly, slight and in several cases open to vari- ous interpretations. The words which en- ter into the discussion occur almost ex- clusively in scholia and glossaries that are fairly late. Then, too, these words were unfamiliar to the ancient scholars, who copy one another or invent their own ety- mologies, with the result that the original form and spelling of the words they cite are difficult to establish, even when, as in the case of Hesychius and Suidas, we have excellent editions of their work. In many cases allowance must also be made for the sad propensity of later scholars to base an emendation of the text of the author they are editing on what they assume is the reading of a similar gloss elsewhere, with- out ascertaining whether the reading ac- tually exists or is itself an emendation. KoXacptpLo-os, the name of the dance, is mentioned only in the passages from Athenaeus and Pollux quoted above. It must be derived from a verb, KoXap3pL?co. This verb exists. It is defined by Hesy- chius, S.V. KoXa/ppLvELv rKtpTa-c.2 Since oKtpraaw is used elsewhere of the jumping or leaping of young horses and goats, and also of Bacchantes, we may suppose that the dance itself was rather active and pos- sibly somewhat orgiastic. KOXaopLSc should be derived from a substantive *KOXa3p-, for which we have evidence in the existing forms KoXac(3pos, KOX a43pov KOX'3pwV, KOXca3povS. It is general- ly assumed that these are all forms of the same word, but, as later discussion will 2 The verb is also used in the passive, meaning "to be mocked, derided" (LXX, Job 5:4). It was defined by Olympiodorus ad loc., and by Hesychius s.V. KaXa- fpLptaOeL?7Lav and KwXaO.pLtaOE1iqav (note the spellings!); Suidas connects it with KoXcafpos, S.V.

No etymology has been established for the word or words.3 Since the dance is connected with Thrace and Caria by Pol- lux (iv. 100) and the "verses" are men- tioned by Athenaeus (xv. 697 c) in con- nection with Phoenicia and Asia Minor, we are probably dealing with a non-Greek and perhaps even a non-Indo-European word group. Technical terms connected with music, poetry, or the dance, and animal names as well, are frequently loan words; many Greek words of this type have been borrowed from a Mediter- ranean substratum. Calling a word a loan word does not, however, define it. At least two, and perhaps three, differ- ent translations of KoXacptpoL/Io are pos- sible, depending on how we set up its der- ivation. The evidence of ancient scholars warrants our defining it as (1) a KCW/0os; (2) a "pig dance"; (3) a "sword dance"(?). These meanings are, moreover, not mu- tually exclusive. 1. A KCw/I0.-This possibility has al- ready been suggested. Athenaeus refers, in two different sections of his work,4 to poems whose wanton and uninhibited na- ture is evident from the context. He speaks of them several times, using the forms KOQXa3poVS and KOX'aopwv, both plural; the gender, however, is not indicated. The passages imply that these verses were used to make fun of individuals-a fact that fits in very well with the meaning "to be derided" attested for the passive of KOXacpL?w (see n. 2). This close semantic connection with the verb indicates that verses of this type may have been used in 3It is listed only in the etymological dictionary of Leo Meyer (Handbuch der griechischen Etymologie [Leipzig, 1902], II, 429), and his comment consists of the words "dunkler Herkunft." 4 iV. 164 e, where the text actually reads KoXApOVS; and xv. 697 c, where the forms KOX6povs and KOX&amp;pWV appear.</page><page sequence="3">100 LILLIAN B. LAWLER AND ALICE E. KOBER connection with the dance; but it does not necessarily imply that the dance was named after the verses. We are not deal- ing with a term that has been defined as meaning "lascivious verses" but with one that apparently has this meaning in a cer- tain context. It is likely, especially since only the plural is attested in this sense, that we have here a secondary meaning of the word (perhaps derived from the use of such verses in the dance, perhaps from the same word as the dance name). It is advisable to look further for the primary meaning. 2. A "pig dance. "-This primary mean- ing may lie in the definition 6 LKKpOS XO?poS given for KoXaO3pos by Suidas and Zonaras.5 The form cited is certainly nominative singular and probably masculine. It may be the same word as the one just dis- cussed; morphologically and semantical- ly, such a conclusion is permissible. It is not a far cry from pigs to the kind of verses involved. The use of xo?pos fre- quently involves a double entendre (e.g., the extended puns in Aristophanes, Ach. 738 ff., where xotpL6pw is also used), and a scholion on Aristophanes Lys. 202 has Kacrpou- acWoLov. Suidas, moreover, men- tions KOXXacpos in explaining the meaning of KoXacqpL&amp; in the passive, although he accounts for the relationship in a different way (see n. 2). 3. A "sword dance."-The evidence here depends entirely on an interpreta- tion of certain glosses of Hesychius. He lists KoXacpov TO KOL&amp;t6lV. Schmidt6 ac- cepts the emendation KOXac3pov- TO xoLpL&amp;ov, since this produces the definition "piglet," which is in conformity with "the small pig"' of Suidas and Zonaras. If we agree, however, that the aim of emendation is to discover, not what an ancient scholar 5 For Suidas see n. 2. Zon. 1230 spells the word ,KoXq#p6s, changing both the spelling and the accent. 6 M. Schmidt, Hesychii Alexandrini lexican, ed. maj. (Jena, 1858). should have written, but what he actually did write, there are certain objections to this correction. The gender of the form KoXafpov of the gloss may be neuter; there is no indication that Hesychius considered it masculine. An examination of some of the words listed in juxtaposition may throw some light on what he had in mind, since he frequently groups his words to- gether in such a way that it is difficult to escape the conclusion that he is etymolo- gizing. After the words beginning with KOK-, Hesychius glosses KWXa, KOXa3pl!ELV, KOXa- fpEVO0,UCEV-, KOXXacpos, KOXcaLv. Let us con- sider these in order. For the first word the codex reads: K&amp;a- &amp;T7a. mEXr7. " "rXa. Kal E03os oPX77eTEW3, o KacL koto's. Schmidt com- ments ad loc.: "K&amp;Aa cod., ordinem tur- batum restituit Is. Vossius coll. Cyr. 63: KoXa- aKEXr ir'3as. Confundit lexicographus KWXWa- 6or ,aEX1 07rXal et KOXEa (sive KoXa) ELaos 6pX?aews. " The alphabetical order clearly calls for KOXa (accent unknown, but Schmidt writes KoXa). It is likely that Hesychius confused several words, but the confusion may have been intentional on his part, since the definitions he gives are quite consistent with one another. The 06rXa, "weapons," of his gloss go with ~otonAOjs; O'rXaL, "hoofs," would not. The first three words of his definition are all neuter plural nouns; the first and second mean "bones, members," or the like; the third is separated from them by i7, "or," which seems to indicate a deliberate change of meaning. Hesychius may have had in mind in writing *KoXa .... O'rXa a later gloss KOXE6S- X OK77K TO) i0ovs, i.e., a "sheath" or "scabbard." A neuter, KOGXoV, with the same meaning, appears in Homer (II. i. 194). Obviously, a scabbard is, next to the sword itself, the most likely piece of armor to be used in a ~ttaAo's. His gloss 067rXov- Ev6EvJa 7OrXE/uLKOV, KaU To at8oZov may further explain his use of 6wrXa in the</page><page sequence="4">THE "THRACIAN PIG DANCE" 101 definition, since the ~t4to-0os certainly had sexual aspects. KOXa3pLtEL'e o.KLpTaV has already been dis- cussed. The next gloss introduces a word that appears only here but must have been re- lated to the foregoing: KOXa03pevo/1fv?J KOXOLS &amp;XXo1i4vn. Schmidt accepts the emendation KwXOLS for the first word of the definition, apparently interpreting it as "jumping with the legs," perhaps refer- ring to something similar to the entrechats of a ballet dancer. It is possible, however, that Hesychius deliberately wrote KOXOLS, repeating the initial KOX- of the word he was defining. Using the explanation of the first word in the series we are discussing, he might have meant "leaping (or danc- ing) with scabbards." Pollux, after all, tells us that the KOXa3pto/1os was an armed dance. The later glosses, KOXEa IroLta Tts opx-loLt and KOXLa opX?1aoecos et'5os, tend to confirm this idea. Passing for the moment over KOXXa3pov, the next word in the series is KOXagELV lrEpaLveLv. o6yKLaofLa. Dictionaries list no literary use of the word with this meaning. Schmidt comments ad loc.: "confundit KOXEEL46V sensu obscoeno et KaMELW o6-yKa- oOaL." o-yKaaoOaL, "to bray," does not con- cern us here. Schmidt is, of course, right in saying that WrepaLveLv defines KOXEE6ELV, not KOX 4ELV. It seems, however, that, once again, Hesychius uses the spelling KOX- for the more normal KOXE-. That he did it deliberately is shown by his gloss, KOXEaoT/4os- rO wepaLveoOaL. wewoLflTraL R a7ro TOV KOX0V Ka' aro TOVr KaOtEVaL e'lS TO KOXOV -roV-rO KOXEWLELV fXEyOV. KOXEza4 usually means "sheathe." It is likely, since KOXaOpopV rO KoL&amp;l65OV occurs in the midst of the other words, that he has also associated the KOX- of this word with the KOX-, "sheath," whose ex- istence he seems to be establishing. In that case he must have thought of -j3pov as a diminutive suffix; the gloss, as it stands, is then quite possible. A "small sheath" (using the word in all its implica- tions) might be described as a "small hollow or cavity." What Hesychius meant to write in this gloss is of great importance for our in- quiry. Whether he was right or wrong is not so important. If he meant to write the gloss as it now stands, he must have had some reason for associating KOXXa3pov with "sheath." If, for instance, he knew that the KoXa3pto-T1s was an armed dance, per- haps a "sword dance" in which the sheath played a part, that might account for the gloss. Since he does not gloss KoXacpLr1f,os0 only KoXafpevo/uf'V KOXOLS a&amp;XXo/4vP can be cited as confirmation of the theory. In spite of what has been said above, the meaning "little pig" for Ko6Xa3pos is certain, even if Hesychius is not emended. Not only is this meaning for the word at- tested from Suidas and Zonaras, but there is a certain amount of rather curious evi- dence that the word may have been a com- pound and that one of the elements meant the "young of animals." This would ac- count for the fact that all the definitions of the word stress its diminutive nature. Hesychius lists W:pLKaXoL XOLPOL.7 At first glance there is not much similarity to KoXXa3pos, but if we divide the words ?l3pL-KaXoL and KOX-a4pos, it is evident that the consonants of the first element of one word and of the second element of the other (and vice versa) are the same. The parallel is even closer between KOXOf3pOS (the form cited by Zonaras) and the word 63pLKaXov (neuter), which is used by Aes- chylus (Ag. 143) of the young of wild animals. The existence of a word 053DLa8 7 Cf. Zon. 1083: IfpUPaXos [sic!]- 6 xoZpos. 8 Photius (s.v. 6fipLa) couples 6j#pta and 6j#pLiKaXa and says that Aeschylus uses the terms of wolf-cubs. Eustathius (1625. 47) also couples them but says they refer to the young of porcupines, and in another pas- sage (1395. 47) he tells us that 6oPpKaaXa are lion-cubs. Pollux (v. 15), using 6opLKxa and 6flplas (accusative</page><page sequence="5">102 LILLIAN B. LAWLER AND ALICE E. KOBER suggests that the other words are com- pounds. This supposition is to some ex- tent confirmed by what looks like another compound: ai43pos Kabrpos (Hesych. s.v.). On the basis of these, a word *613pos (ini- tial vowel dubious), meaning "young of animals," might be set up;9 it may form the second element of KoXaa3pos. Eusta- thius (quoting Aristophanes of Byzan- tium, ad Od. 1817. 19) has a word KoXop3pw, as a term for the young of wild swine. Inasmuch as -top is the normal Greek diminutive suffix, it is not surpris- ing that it is found attached to a word whose persistently diminutive meaning must have puzzled later scholars.'0 If the KoXap3pLt,o's was named after a word for "small pig," this "pig dance" may have involved the carrying of small pigs. On the other hand, it may have been a fertility dance. There is some indication that a "pig dance" may have been done in armor in the Hesychius gloss, Ka2rpla tl6Os opX'px'cwTE CvorXov. In short, it is quite conceivable that the KoXa/ptuYuobs involved all the elements implied by KoXaf3pot, "lascivious verses"; KoXa/3poS, "a small pig"; and even K6Xafpov, "'a small cavity or sheath." plural), respectively, for 6flpixaXa and 6fpLa, says that poets use these words of the young of all wild animals. For 6$pta there is further evidence in Aelian (Nat. an. vii. 47), who quotes the word fromi Euripides and Aes- chylus. All these statements differ from one another in details but obviously go back to the same source. 9 Perhaps Hesycius (s.v. 6uopos- %otp6 ov) is perti- nent here, although the word has an m. The trouble- some term 60pa, "young female slave," may be con- nected with this group. 10 Aristophanes of Byzantium (op. cit.) also says that a word poX6,Bptov has the same meaning; and Eustathius, just before he quotes Aristophanes, tells us that poXo#p6s and poXo&amp;p17-s are used of the sow. Aelian (loc. cit.) mentions only ItOXO6pLov as the word for the youing of wild swine; Hesychius (s.v. poXpoa) says that the word is used generally of the young of wild animals. Since KOLpoov and AOMO&amp;LOv differ only in the initial letter, it is probable that the spellinig of KAa#pos has been changed to KOXilp8OV to make it resemble the other word. We come now to evidence of a different sort. In the body of facts known about ancient Thrace, from statements in Greek literature, and from objects found by archeologists, there is much that is of sig- nificance for the present inquiry. It is known, for instance, that the religion of Thrace" was primitive and that it was characterized by animism, a belief in the transmigration of souls, and animal-wor- ship. Another feature of Thracian religion was a '(sword cult." Tattooing had a part in Thracian ritual, and the picture tat- tooed upon the devotee was frequently that of a sacred animal. Prominent among the divinities of the country was Bendis, who was identified by the Greeks with Artemis (Herod. v. 7). The appropriate offering to Bendis was a pig. In later times there was even a Bendideion in Athens, where the goddess was portrayed as hold- ing a pig. She was associated with the Nymphs, as was Artemis; and to both Bendis and the Nymphs mystery rituals were celebrated. Closely connected with the religion of Thrace and Phrygia was the worship of the Kabeiroi; their mother, Kabeiro, is, in fact, actually called Thracian by Non- nus (Dionyjs. xiv. 17). The mysteries of the Kabeiroi were celebrated by the Greeks in many places, but particularly on the islands of Samothrace and Lemnos (near Thrace, of course) and in the city of Thebes. In these mysteries, dances played a large part-fertility dances, around a phallic symbol, and apotropaic dances, accompanied with bells and other noise-making devices, perhaps introduced originally to ward off the wild Thracian storms. The divinities became protectors of sailors and in the minds of the Greeks were somewhat confused with Castor and Polydeuces. 11 Pauily-Wissova-Kroll, RE, s.v. "Thrake-Reli- gion' (Gawril Kazarow).</page><page sequence="6">THE "THRACIAN PIG DANCE" 103 In the Kabeirion at Thebes there were found innumerable figurines depicting swine'2-over two hundred in terra cotta and several in bronze and lead. In the same place there was found a number of vases portraying votaries wearing pig masks."3 These are regarded by many scholars as pure burlesques of the mys- teries. However, the animal masquerade is an ancient and significant device for securing kinship with the divinity to whom the animal is sacred. It may well be that a pig dance was a feature of the mysteries of the Kabeiroi and that it en- tered those mysteries from Thrace. In various regions around the Aegean there is further evidence for pig dances of one sort or another, from prehistoric times on down to the Hellenistic period. An "island gem," published by Ridgeway in 193114 and now in the British Museum, portrays a human figure with the head of a sow and with wings. That the figure is meant to be real and not supernatural is indicated by the presence of a girdle about the waist, which evidently holds securely in place the combination mask, wig, and upper garment to which the wings are at- tached. The legs of the figure, although somewhat cramped by the small area of the gem, nevertheless show unmistakably rapid and violent motion. Elsewhere15 the belief has been expressed that such a pose is often used to represent a dance. Ridge- way is of the same opinion in this case, and he refers the dance to a Minoan- Mycenaean animal cult intermediate be- 12 Paul Wolters, "Das Kabirenheiligtum bei The- ben. IV.

One is reminded here of the giant winged boar of Clazomenae, used as a coin type by that city and also by Samos and re- garded by Keller'6 as a symbol of storm and hail (cf. Hesych.: 654upos xotpU%cov, which may be a mixture of 0/43pOS' K'arpos and 6ofpos xoLp'Lov). Of Hellenistic date but reflecting the cult practices of a far earlier epoch-prob- ably the Mycenaean age-is the carving on a piece of marble drapery found in the shrine of Despoina at Lycosura.'7 Here eleven female figures wearing animal masks run along in a rapid processional dance, to the music of a cithara; and one of the women wears a pig mask. The mar- ble drapery seems to be a votive offering and to portray features of the cult of Des- poina.'8 Despoina, of course, is a divinity associated with the great mother-goddess of prehistoric Crete and Asia Minor,'9 who is also 7rorvLa 077pcov. Of similar type but of uncertain prove- nance is a small terra cotta now in the Louvre.20 It depicts a woman with a sow's head and with cloven hoofs instead of hands, beating a tympanon. Perhaps of some significance is the fact that near it is displayed2' a terra-cotta satyr, hold- ing a wine cup and seated on the back of a sow. 16 Otto Keller, Die antike Tierwelt (Leipzig: Engel- mann, 1909-13), I, 391. 17 Charles Normand, Lycosura: second livre du cor- pus des monumnents grecs (Paris: Au Bureau de l'Ami des Monuments et des Arts, n.d.), pp. 26-27 and P1.

KOBER On a fifth-century amphora22 three masked dancers are portrayed, engaged in what Schnabel thinks is the Ko6pba, the characteristic dance of Old Comedy. One of the figures wears a mask with pig's ears. Bent far over, with his two feet to- gether, the dancer thrusts out his tongue maliciously and apparently shakes his thighs in the lascivious schema usually called ALKVo3o-Oai. All three dancers are wrapped in cloaks, and the hands of two of them (including the one with the pig's ears) are thrust forward under the cloaks in the gesture which Schnabel thinks is the "sword-thrust," S/qro,40's. The tempo of the dance is obviously spirited. Some writers see in the pig mask a designation of the parasite. But perhaps more signifi- cant is the fact that one form of the Kop5aa seems to have been a descendant of a dance to Artemis as -ro'rvta %-qpcov and fer- tility goddess,23 in which the dancers were costumed or masked as therianthropic demons. This primitive dance accounts, in all probability, for the presence of so many animal titles in Old Comedy-the Gall-Flies, the Birds, and the Frogs of Magnes; the Goats of Eupolis; the Griffins of Plato; the Ants and the Nightingales of Cantharus; the Frogs of Callias; the Fishes and the Ass of Archippus; the Bees of Diocles; the Frogs, the Wasps, the Storks, and the Birds of Aristophanes; and, significantly, the Swine of Cephiso- dorus. It is entirely possible that the fig- ure on the vase actually portrays an old pig dance. Demosthenes (Crown 260) speaks of an orgiastic dance through the streets by dancers crowned with fennel and white poplar, who shout is ai-rrqs aTTrns V1s ; 22 Now in the museum at Tarquinia (see Louis Sechan, La Danse grecque antique [Paris: De Boccard, 19301, p. 199, Fig. 44; Heinz Schnabel, Kordax [Mu- nich: Beck, 1910], pp. 3-6; 17-25, and PI. I). 23 Schnabel, op. cit. pp. 40-53; Lillian B. Lawler, 'Ixaoes xopevral, CP, XXXVI (1941), 143-44. Frazer24 thinks that v'is here is a form of vs, that the cry merely means "Pig At- tis!" and that Attis, in whose honor the dance was performed, was originally wor- shiped in the form of a pig. The ritualistic significance of the pig was very marked in antiquity. In many parts of Asia Minor, in Egypt, and in In- dia the pig was regarded as unclean. Among the Greeks, however, it was be- lieved to be the oldest of sacrificial ani- mals and it was often used in purificatory ceremonies. It was a fertility demon in many cults and a charm against evil. Frazer thinks it was from early times an embodiment of the corn spirit.25 Cook finds clear evidence for a "cult of the swine" in Minoan-Mycenaean times.26 Schliemann found at Tiryns several terra- cotta figurines depicting standing women, each holding a small pig in the left arm.27 Although of the classical and Hellenistic periods, these figurines may reflect cult practices of remote antiquity. Similar fig- ures were found at Eleusis, Halicarnassus, Tegea, Sardinia, and elsewhere-chiefly in shrines of Demeter. Eitrem sees in the Crommyonian sow a demoniac signifi- cance.28 The most prolific of animals, the pig was used in the classical period in the worship of Demeter, Kore, Dionysus, Aphrodite, Adonis, Artemis, Apollo, Zeus, and the Mother of the Gods (Paus. v. 16. 8; viii. 38. 8; iv. 8. 1; Schol. ad Aristoph. Ach. 747; Theoc. 24. 97)-practically all of which stem, at least in part, from the great Cretan goddess and her consort- son.

As Thomas has said: "Where animals are sacred to a god, mimicry of their move- ments is equivalent to prayer and adora- tion."30 If we can trust the word of Zenod- otus (Athen. iii. 96 a), there was actually a festival to Aphrodite which was called vr71pta, at which pigs were sacrificed, al- though some scholars think the historian was punning on gvur7pta. An inscription cited by Cook3' would seem to indicate that one of the priestesses of Demeter and Kore was called ivs. Many writers think that the passage in the Acharnians of Aristophanes (738 ff.) in which young girls are called "little pigs" is an extended parody of some ritual to Demeter. Oth- ers connect the legend of Circe and her "swine" (Od. x. 282-83, 338, 390) with a primitive totemistic cult. The Artemis- Actaeon story belongs in the same cate- gory. Similar to both legends is the myth of Ishtar in Babylonia-the goddess who changed those who fell in love with her into animals, which she then hunted and wounded or slew. It is entirely possible that a part of her ritual was a mimetic dance in which worshipers represented the unfortunate man-animals of the myth. We have noted a portrayal of a pig dance at the shrine of Despoina at Lyco- sura. Pausanias, describing the shrine, tells us (viii. 37) that below the images of Despoina and Demeter there were carved representations of the Curetes and, on the base, of the Corybantes. This is of great 29 The importance of hides and garments made of skins, from Cretan times until late in the classical peri- od, is very great (see Cook, op. cit.; Nilsson, op. cit., pp. 132-36; D. M. Robinson, "A New Arcadian In- scription," CP, XXXVIII [19431. 194-95; A. W. Persson, The Religion of Greece in Prehistoric Times [Berkeley: University of California Press, 19421, p. 161). 30 Op. cit., p. 496. ax A. B. Cook, Zeus (Cambridge: Cambridge TJni- versity Press, 1914-40), I, 784. significance in view of a passage in Athe- naeus (ix. 375 f-376 a): Pigs, says Athe- naeus, were sacred among the people of ancient Crete, because a sow suckled Zeus when he was born on Mount Dicte, "where there is a secret rite"; the sow, he says, moved about, and by her grunting drowned the cries of the baby Zeus, so that passersby did not hear him. As a re- sult, he goes on, the Cretans revere the pig and will not eat pork. On the contrary, the people of Praesus actually sacrifice to the pig, especially before a wedding.32 The latter part of this account, of course, reveals a very old totemistic ritu- al, definitely connected with fertility. The earlier part of the story recalls strik- ingly the legend of the Curetes (or the Corybantes), who danced, clashing spear against shield, to drown the cries of the infant Zeus, so that his father might not hear him. Oddly enough, Pausanias tells us (viii. 38. 2) that on a sacred mountain near Lycosura there is a place called Cre- taea and that the Arcadians say that this is the "Crete" where the child Zeus was reared! All of this, together with the carved figures of Curetes and Corybantes at Lycosura, points to a close connection between the Minoan and the Arcadian cults-a connection which becomes even more striking when we place side by side the pig-masked dancer of the Lycosura drapery and the winged pig dancer of the prehistoric "island gem." And, incidental- ly, Orphic Hymn xxxviii. 20-21 speaks of the Curetes and Corybantes as taking part in the rituals of the Kabeiroi on Samothrace. Cook33 has collected several instances of the pig in the cult of Zeus in Crete; and 32 Sir Arthur Evans, in The Palace of Minos (Lon- don: Macmillan, 1921-35), IV, 711-24, gives illustra- tions of the use of the phonetic sign for "swine" in Cretan names. This would indicate, apparently, that the connotation was not derogatory. st Zeus, I. 652-68.</page><page sequence="9">106 LILLIAN B. LAWLER AND ALICE E. KOBER it is interesting to note that he connects the Cretan worship of Zeus with Thrace and declares that the intervening islands served as "stepping stones" for the spread of the cult. Ridgeway34 also connects the aboriginal Thracians with the inhabitants of prehistoric Greece. It is a matter of fact that double axes have been found in very early deposits in Thrace. Pollux (iv. 100) says that our dance is Thracian and Carian; and the link between the Cretan and the Carian civilizations has been well established. It is clear that in prehistoric Crete an- nual ceremonies were held in commemora- tion of the birth of the son of the Great Goddess and that a feature of those cere- monies was an armed dance recalling that of the mythical Curetes, who had come to be thought of as fertility demons.35 These dances were not war dances but rather noise-making dances, to frighten off evil spirits and to invoke the powers of fertili- ty. Since metal makes more noise than other substances, the dancers clashed metal objects together; and since the handiest metal objects for male dancers were weapons, the ceremony naturally be- came an armed dance. It was character- ized by energetic leaps, sympathetic mag- ic to cause the crops to grow high. Similar dances are found among all agricultural peoples. In view of the story in Athenaeus and the representations at Lycosura and on the "island gem," it seems likely that a mimetic pig dance, with much "moving about" and "grunting,"36 may have been used, along with the armed dances, at the "secret rite" on Mount Dicte. If this is so, we have a combination of an armed dance and a pig dance, in a fertility connotation; 34 Op. cit., II, 491. as Persson, op. cit., p. 147. 36 See Thomas, op. cit., p. 525: "In Wales, the grunt- ing of a pig is imitated during an eclipse of the moon." and if Cook is correct, the combination appears in a cult which can be associated with Thrace. Frazer37 has given us descriptions of two native dances of Borneo which should be considered in connection with our "Thracian pig dance." In one-a good- luck dance at the new year-a priestess, wearing a panther skin and a helmet, danced around a group of tethered pigs, while on either side of her two armed priests cut and thrust at evil spirits in the air and other priestesses seized little pigs and danced with them in their arms. Later the pigs were slain. In the other-a dance to expel evil spirits-women flogged a small suckling pig which was carried along, tied in a basket, and clashed metal cymbals and bells to drive off evil. In this case, also, the pig was later killed. These, obviously, are pig dances of a different sort from those we have already noted. They are not mimetic but strictly ritualis- tic. Their purpose, however, would seem to be similar to that of the Greek and Cretan dances. Whether the "Thracian pig dance" ac- tually made use of a little pig or whether one of the dancers in it portrayed a pig or whether it was merely a Kw/.Os or an ob- scene dance to invoke the powers of life and to repel evil spirits we do not know. We can only say that there is precedent for all these types. In any case the pig dance must have been a fertility rite, and it seems to have been spirited, perhaps even orgiastic. In conclusion, we should like to call at- tention to an Athenian black-figured amphora of the sixth century B.C., now in the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, which was published by Dorothy Kent Hill in the Gazette des beaux-arts, XXIV (1943), 183-89. One side of the amphora 37 Op. cit., VII, 95; IX, 200-201.</page><page sequence="10">THE "THRACIAN PIG DANCE" 107 portrays six armed men, all facing to the left-"three warriors kneeling behind round shields and three archers standing erect" and brandishing bows and, per- haps, clubs. Miss Hill correctly interprets the scene as an armed dance and correctly notes that the costume of the warriors is Thracian. She believes, however, that the scene portrayed is a Pyrrhic dance, by Athenians wearing Thracian costume to honor "the Thracians who were allies of the Athenians during the age of Peisis- tratos when the vase was made." It seems to us more likely that the dancers are ac- tually meant to be Thracians and that the dance is not the Athenian Pyrrhic but rather one of the many Thracian armed dances for which there is evidence in Greek literature. Whether it is our KOXa- ,Bptujios or not it is impossible to deter- mine; no gestures appropriate to a "pig dance" are evident. HUNTER COLLEGE BROOKLYN COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
