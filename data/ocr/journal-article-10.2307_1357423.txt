<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mispe Yamim Bronzes RAFAEL FRANKEL Department of Land of Israel Studies Haifa University Haifa, Israel RAPHAEL VENTURA Department of Archaeology and Ancient Near Eastern Cultures Tel Aviv University rafi v@beitbetl.beitbetl.ac.il Four bronze artifacts were found at Mispe Yamim, a sacred site on a mountain peak in the Upper Galilee. The find spot was close to a temple that was built in the Persian period and continued as an open air sanctuary in the Hellenistic period. The bronze pieces are a situla bearing Egyptian motifs and inscriptions and a Phoenician votive inscription to Astarte by Cakbor son of bod 'e'mun; an Apis bull typical in stance and attributes except for unusual "winged scarabs" on its back; a recumbent ram, almost certainly a weight and probably from the Persian period; and a prancing lion cub that originally was an accessory, probably a handle, of a larger vessel, unusual in form and probably made locally. The bronzes were probably votive gifts to the temple in the Persian period but the find spot and the smashing of the Apis bull and of another figurine of an Egyptian deity found at the site suggest a connection to the final stage of the cultic center and probably to desecration by Hasmonean capturers of the site. INTRODUCTION he four bronze artifacts described in this article were found at Mispe Yamim in 1986 during an archaeological survey carried out by a study group led by Y. Tepper to examine the main sites of the region. The site was first reported by Druks (1965), and after the discovery of the bronzes was excavated in two seasons-August 1988 and July-August 1989-under the direction of R. Frankel (1989-1990; 1992; 1997). The site is on Mt. Mispe Yamim (MR 1933/2604; 734 m above sea level; area 90 x 30 m, or 2.7 dunams), a southern spur of Mt. Meron, the highest mountain of the Upper Galilee; it is immediately above the steep scarp that divides the Upper Galilee from the Lower Galilee. The location provides a remarkable view of the Lower Galilee from the Golan Heights and Lake Kinneret in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. The site consists of a large structure on the peak (25 x 25 m) connected to an enclosure that extends eastward. The wall of the enclosure was built around the edge of a terrace about 5 m lower than the peak. Two buildings were incorpo- rated into the southern section of this enclosure wall. The bronzes were found next to the northwest corner of the western, and larger, building. This building, which proved to be a temple, and the large western structure on the peak were excavated in the 1988 and 1989 seasons. The site was first occupied in Iron Age II but no architecture could be assigned to that period. The main occupation stage was during the Persian pe- riod, when the buildings under discussion were con- structed. The temple consisted of two rooms (6.0 x 13.7 m and 4.0 x 4.8 m). The main room contained bases for three columns and had a paved stone floor. There were benches around the walls and an altar with four steps leading up to it at the northwest cor- ner. Another altar was exposed near the southern wall. The altars apparently served as tables on which to place offerings or perhaps the effigy of the deity. Numerous Persian-period juglets and bottles were found in the temple. During the Hellenistic period the area of the temple became an open courtyard and the northwest altar was changed; the steps were filled in and a large stone slab found leaning against the altar was probably placed on it, presumably to accommodate sacrifices. A Hellenistic coin found on the step be- side the altar, and Hellenistic pottery found in the vicinity, clearly date this stage. Large quantities of bones were found during the excavation. The east- ern half of the western structure consisted of a courtyard the floor of which was bedrock, while the western half consisted of a series of compartments 39</page><page sequence="2">40 FRANKEL AND VENTURA BASOR 311 i i I WO Fig. 1.

This structure could have been the base of a watchtower or citadel, but since the ex- cavators found no trace of a floor or any superstruc- ture, perhaps the structure and the stone courtyard formed a platform on which cultic ceremonies took place. Alternatively, it could have been the entrance courtyard of the site. The evidence suggests that the site was not a settlement, but a temple precinct. SITULA Inventory no. 87-1443, Length 16.7 cm General Information Situlae are bronze vessels with separate, curved handle, which were used in funerary or temple ritu- als, mainly in Egypt. Their function was closely connected to the notion of rebirth and regeneration, and they were sometimes offered by private indi- viduals as tokens of devotion to a deity (Green 1987: 66). Despite the large quantity of specimens that have survived, only a few have been properly published. The leading article on the subject, by Lichtheim (1947), was followed by a study by Mon- net-Saleh (unpublished)1 and one by Evrard-Derriks and Quaegebeur (1979). The drop-shaped, slender situla discussed here (fig. 1) was made of cast bronze. Its projecting lip holds two large, upright circular rings through which the handle passes. The handle is made of a single curved bronze rod shaped like the Greek letter 92, with elongated extremities bent upwards. The han- dle is half as high as the body of the situla. The form and decoration identify this specimen as Lichtheim's Type 111/17 (Lichtheim 1947: 175; pl. 4), the most common type of situla. However, it lacks the typical knob. The decoration on the vessel's surface is di- vided into five bands of unequal height. Bands 1 and 2 are separated by a single line; the rest of the seg- ments are separated by double horizontal lines that circle the body of the situla and also serve as base lines. Description Upper Band, Phoenician Inscription. This band, immediately beneath the rim of the situla, contains a Phoenician inscription, carved secondarily. Gener-</page><page sequence="3">1998 THE MISPE YAMIM BRONZES 41 ally this band is reserved for a short invocation formula mentioning the name and filiation of the do- nor, as well as the name of the deity that is invoked and to whom the vessel is dedicated. Second Band, Journey of the Solar Bark. In this segment, a single solar bark is towed by four jackals, with four baboons facing the scene in adoration. The representation of a solar bark drawn by jack- als is derived from the iconography of the fourth hour of the night journey of the sun, known from post-New Kingdom designs of the "Book of What Is In the Netherworld." According to Lichtheim (1947: 176-77), this scene is less frequent and was adopted much later than the one depicting the ado- ration and greeting of the morning sun. Many situ- lae contain, in their upper register, a representation of both solar barks. The night bark, drawn by jack- als, is followed by the morning bark, greeted by baboons. In the example under discussion, the two are con- flated into one, but the dual notion is preserved by the representation of both jackals and baboons. The solar bark is typical, with a fringed mat at the prow and the figure of a child. A falconhead sun god (without the sun disk on his head) stands alone in the central cabin, facing right. He holds a was- scepter and the Cankh sign. The cabin consists of a rigid canopy held up by two columns with campan- iform capitals. The steering oar is activated by a falconhead helmsman. Both the oar and its retain- ing pole have upper ends decorated in the form of a falcon's head. Three additional, undefinable figures stand in the bark in front of the cabin, facing right. The bark rests on an elongated rectangular strip representing water. Separate ropes lead to each drag- ging jackal. The jackals are partially superposed. The baboons stand in a row on their hind legs, fac- ing the jackals, which draw the boat. The baboons' front paws are lifted in adoration, and they wear some kind of hip string. Main Band, Offering Scene. Offering scenes in which a single worshiper faces a long series of deities (instead of having one or two worshipers facing a single, standing or enthroned god) became fully developed in Dynasty 26 (Lichtheim 1947: 177). In our example, a single male worshiper pre- sents libation, lotus flower, food, and drink to a sequence of deities standing in a row. The wor- shiper faces left. He is as high as most of the gods, bald (a priest?), and clothed in a short kilt; two diagonal lines indicate the edge of the cloth, and he wears a "broad collar." His right hand extends down at a slight angle and he holds a hes libation vessel, almost upright, at its narrowest point. There are no traces of water emerging from the vessel. The left hand is folded with palm close to the worshiper's mouth in a gesture signifying speech or oath. Al- though we are not aware of a parallel posture on other situlae an oath is implied by the content of the Phoenician inscription. A horizontal strip above the figure was meant to contain the worshiper's name, but remains empty. Instead, a long vertical strip behind him contains the continuation and end of the Phoenician inscrip- tion from the upper band. This, too, was carved secondarily. In front of the worshiper, an offering table is set up on the same baseline (figs. 1B, 2). It is a typical tripartite table with a single high foot. Three loaves (two round and one oval) are arranged symme- trically on the plate. A large lotus flower hovers above the loaves, turned in the direction of the chest of the foremost deity. Its stem curves down behind the table. Two high, sealed wine (or water) jars with enlaced flower stems are set on low stands under the table, on either side of the foot. Two short verti- cal lines of inscription, in Egyptian hieroglyphs, fill the space above the offering table; they identify the foremost god as Amon-lpy. First Deity: Amon-lpy, Facing Right (fig. 3). By both his position and his stature (he is larger than the gods who follow him in the row), Amon-lpy is set apart as the main recipient of the offerings. He is mummiform and ithyphallic, and stands on a maat- shaped socle. His right arm, palm en-face, is prop- erly raised at an angle, with the neheh-scepter set above it. The other arm is invisible (tucked under the wrappings). The region of the phallus is too corroded to show any details. The feathers of his shuty-crown are unusually short because of space considerations. A small sun disk is discernible be- tween the feathers. A broad collar decorates his upper chest, and the X-shaped mummy bands are barely visible on his wrappings. A long, calf-length "streamer" hangs from the crown. The space under the raised arm is taken by the was-scepter held by deity no. 2. Second Deity: Isis, Facing Right (fig. 4). Isis holds the was-scepter in her left hand, and probably</page><page sequence="4">42 FRANKEL AND VENTURA BASOR 311 7. (lle ,mm- Fig. 2. Situla worshiper and offering table.

She wears a tightly fitting strapped dress and the cow's horn crown with included sun disk. A uraeus adorns her brow and a band knot the rear of her wig. The scep- ter is held in vertical position, its forked butt slightly above the baseline. The vertical description above identifies her as Isis. The "Hathorian" representation of Isis alternates with her typical form (with the "throne" symbol on her head) on situlae. Isis is a key figure in the revivification of the dead, as she restored Osiris to life. She and Nephthys are the main caretakers of the dead. Third Deity: Nephthys, Facing Right (fig. 4). Similar to the figure of Isis, Nephthys differs only in her headpiece, which is the hieroglyphic symbol of her name, and in the was-scepter which is smaller than the one held by Isis. The figure of Nephthys is more corroded than that of Isis, particularly in the region of the head. Above Nephthys, a horizontal inscription mentions her name. Fourth Deity: Haroeris (Re), Facing Right (fig. 5). The god has a human body with falcon's head upon which rests the sun disk encircled by a uraeus. Haro- eris has a tail and wears a short pleated skirt, the</page><page sequence="5">1998 THE MISPE YAMIM BRONZES 43 . ...... ....... Wea H'?? Tz? Fig. 4. Situla-Isis and Nephtys. ::71' Fig. 5. Situla-Re and Montu. pleats showing as diagonal lines. He holds the was staff and probably the Cankh sign. A vertical inscrip- tion above Haroeris identifies him as Re. Fifth Deity: Montu, Facing Right (fig. 5). The features of this god are barely visible due to corro- sion of the metal. He is similar to Haroeris in that he has a falcon's head and is holding was and Cankh. His headdress is composed of a small sun disk with two falcon's feathers tilted slightly back. The hori- zontal inscription above mentions Montu. Sixth Deity: Nefertem, Facing Right (fig. 6). Nefertem is fully anthropomorphic. He wears a curved beard and a wig, but no crown. His garment is held by straps. He holds a staff bearing his sym- bol at its top (lotus flower capped by two feathers). The short inscription above the god mentions his name, Nefertem. Nefertem and Sekhmet represent the Memphite region. One should expect to find Ptah as well, the principal member of the Memphite triad. Ptah, mostly in his kiosk shrine, is commonly depicted on situlae alongside Sekhmet and Nefertem. On this situla, however, not only is Ptah absent, but the nor- mal sequence of Sekhmet then Nefertem is reversed.</page><page sequence="6">44 FRANKEL AND VENTURA BASOR 311 Irk7 !iii) ........... i~iit!Hiii !ili~iii .................. . . . . . . . . . . . for.. . . .: ......... ............ ....... ::. ........................-0 , ..: ............... .. ..,.,.. .... :i~ii![iiiiii~ii!!:iiii i 4t .... ..::.:::.:. ..? ... .

Seventh Deity: Sekhmet, Facing Right (fig. 6). Sekhmet is portrayed as a woman with the head of a lioness. She wears the sun disk with a coiled uraeus on her head. Her right hand is raised forward in a gesture of salutation. The other hand seems to be holding or leaning on some object. Above Sekhmet is an inscription mentioning her name. Fourth Band. Souls of Pe and Nekhen. This band consists of six rectangles and five vertical sep- arating strips. There are three rectangles in a row, each of which contains a kneeling human figure with falcon head, facing left. Opposite them are the remaining three rectangles, containing kneeling hu- man figures with jackal heads, facing right. All the figures wear striped dresses and hold one fist to the breast while the other arm is held up at an angle performing the henu rite of jubilation. The strip that separates the foremost jackal head from the fore- most falcon head was left empty. There is no sepa- rating strip between the rectangles of the last jackal head and the last falcon head, set back to back. The remaining strips bear vertical inscriptions in Egyp- tian hieroglyphs. The inscriptions identify the falcon heads as "souls of Nekhen" and the jackal heads as "souls of Pe." The souls of Pe and the souls of Nekhen are fre- quently depicted on situlae in this specific register. In most cases they perform the henu rite in the direc- tion of the rising sun, the latter shown as "Harpo- crates on the lotus" or as a winged scarab, or in his morning bark. Bottom Decoration, Lotus Flower (fig. 7). The center of the lotus flower is situated at the lower tip of the situla. Its pointed petals, curving sym- metrically upward, decorate the last band. There are 32 petals, arranged in 8 cruciform layers, pointing to symmetrically differing orientations. Inscriptions (Except where noted, the inscriptions are in sin- gle rows, reading right to left.) Inscription 1. Phoenician, see pp. 46-49, below. Inscription 2. Phoenician, see pp. 46-49, below. Inscription 3. Egyptian, Band 3, above the lotus flower on the offering table. There are two col- umns, reading right to left: (1) Dd mdw [i]n 'Imn; (2) -IIpy, "Words spoken by Amon-lpy." The formula dd mdw in ("recitation by .. .") nor- mally precedes the actual words pronounced by the figure to which the formula is attached. Here, how- ever, as in other situlae, there is no text attached to the formula. By this time dd mdw had lost its lit- eral meaning and was merely used as a fossilized introduction of a god's name near that god's pictorial</page><page sequence="7">1998 THE MISPE YAMIM BRONZES 45 ... .. Fig. 7. Situla-lotus flower. representation. In many examples of the Graeco- Roman period, even this introduction was dispensed with, and the "inscription" bands in front of the deities were left entirely blank. According to Lichtheim (1947: 177), Min or ithy- phallic Amon-Re is the principal god in most of the Type III situlae. His function is primarily as a god of generative force, natural in a vessel that serves in a context of revivification.2 'Imn (m) 'Ipt (rsyt) is the ithyphallic Amon of Luxor, a fertility mummiform god with double feather crown and other attributes that are identical to those of Min. On the other hand, the epithet 'Ipy, as in this situla, derives probably from 'Ipw = Akh- mim (Erman and Grapow 1955: 69.5), where Min was the main deity. Min was 'Ipy (Akhmimite). Here we do not have the city determinative of Panopolis (Akhmim) but we do have the epithet 'Ipy with the 'Ipt determinative of Luxor. This is a conflation that emphasizes the identification of these fertility dei- ties (cf. Otto 1975). Inscription 4. Egyptian, Band 3, above Isis: Dd mdw [i]n 3st, "Words spoken by Isis." Inscription 5. Egyptian, Band 3, above Nephthys: Dd mdw [i]n Nbt-hwt, "Words spoken by Nephthys." Inscription 6. Egyptian, Band 3, above Haroeris: Dd mdw [i]n Rc, "Words spoken by Re." Inscription 7. Egyptian, Band 3, above Montu: Dd mdw [i]n Mntw, "Words spoken by Montu." Inscription 8. Egyptian, Band 3, above Nefertem: Nfr-tmw, "Nefertem." Exceptionally, the recurring form dd mdw [i]n does not precede the names of Nefertem or of Sekh- met who follows. We do not believe that its absence was due to lack of room since, in the case of Sekh- met, there was enough space to add the epithet "mis- tress of the sky," which was not absolutely necessary for her identification. Inscription 9. Egyptian, Band 3, above Sekhmet: Sbmt nb[t] pt, "Sekhmet, mistress of the sky." Inscriptions 10, 11. Egyptian, Band 4, two sepa- rating strips between figures of falcon heads. These are two single columns: B3w Nan, "Souls of Nekhen." Inscriptions 12, 13. Egyptian, Band 4, two separat- ing strips between figures of jackal heads. Two single columns: B3w P, "Souls of Pe." Dating The fine dating of situlae of the Late Period is quite problematic. The long series of gods, con- fronted by a single individual (priest) and the occur- rence of the night bark of the sun, advocate for a dating not earlier than the Saitic period. The absence of Ptah and the reversal of the traditional order be- tween Sekhmet and Nefertem hint at an even later period. On the other hand, some elements hint at a date earlier than the Graeco-Roman period. The decora- tion is not in high relief. The inscription bands are not left totally blank. The forms of the gods, their attributes, and the dresses are exact and well made. The rare gesture of the worshiper proves that the pat- tern was not slavishly copied. Therefore, we would tentatively date the situla to the Persian period. One may conclude that this situla was mass pro- duced, with all but the name of the dedicant and the purpose of the dedication. The use of such items as ex-votos to deities could have been propagated into</page><page sequence="8">46 FRANKEL AND VENTURA BASOR 311 23 22 21 20 19 18 17 16 15 14 1312 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 / IV V f Y D / X) P K / 3 n ID X n / n In Y 29 28 27 26 25 24 Fig. 8.

An- other situla with Phoenician inscription, from the Art Museum of Princeton University, was published by McCarter (1993) and dated by him to the sixth century B.C. PHOENICIAN INSCRIPTION Description The Phoenician inscription was engraved on the situla in two sections; the first was horizontal, on the upper band of the situla below the projecting rim; the other was vertical on the narrow panel between the beginning and the end of the main band. In both cases the inscription was engraved on parts of the situla that lacked Egyptian reliefs or inscriptions. Between the words are word dividers. These are in the form of small vertical strokes. There is, how- ever, no special sign to mark where the horizontal part of the inscription-which encircles the entire vessel-commences. Therefore the beginning of the inscription as it is presented here has been deter- mined by the context, as has the placing of the ver- tical section after the horizontal. The inscription is a typical Phoenician votive in- scription. It consists of 29 letters, comprising eight words, six (23 letters) in the horizontal section and two final words (6 letters) in the vertical section (fig. 8). The text reads (belonging) to Ckbw (read Ckbr?) the son of bd smn I am making (this inscription?) for Astarte because (she) heard (my) voice. 0, to/of: The preposition is used here to show possession (Segert 1976: 210 ?66.444). 13l39, Ckbw: This name is not attested in the Phoenician or Hebrew onomasticon (Benz 1972). Avigad (1986: 93) restored Ckb on his bulla 140 as Cakbor a name already known from two Hebrew seals and appearing in the Bible (2 Kgs 22:12, 14). : .7 - .?...... . . .......? ....::.ow w....ls Fig. 9. Situla-Phoenician inscription, letters 20-23, 1-5. It is probable that here also Ckbw is a misspelling, a not uncommon occurrence (Benz 1972: 200-202) and should be read as Ckbr. It suggests perhaps that the res at the end of the word was not clearly pronounced. 7MI1K T1 ~l, the son of bd Imn: Although there is a word divider between the two parts of the name, they are clearly one name. The name is known previously only once from an East Mediterranean milieu appearing twice in an inscription from Citium (CIS 57.2, 3) but is common in Punic inscriptions (Benz 1972: 75). bd is to be pronounced bod and to be understood as meaning "in the hand of/in the care of" (Kaufman 1977: 120, n. 12). es'mun is pri- marily a Sidonian deity (Gibson 1982: 103, 116) but theophoric names incorporating the name of this deity are known from other regions. YDIt, I am making: The imperfect could also mean "I will make." In most Phoenician votive in- scriptions the object made is specified. In this case,</page><page sequence="9">1998 THE MISPE YAMIM BRONZES 47 A:.o? q4 Al Fig. 10. Situla-Phoenician inscription, letters 5-13. - s9,iiii Jr? Fig. 11. Situla-Phoenician inscription, letters 12-16. presumably because of lack of space, the object to be devoted to the deity has been omitted. The im- plied object of the verb, what the devotee did, was to engrave the inscription and offer the situla to the deity. P. K. McCarter has suggested (personal communication May 1977) that the first letter of this word should be sin and because of the similarity of the letters "alep and sin in the inscription the en- graver mistakenly engraved an "alep. ?in would ac- cord much better to Phoenician idiom and the translation would then be "which he made." nMInVY1L, to Astarte: The goddess to whom the situla was devoted. ?p Y1?7l, because (she) heard the sound (of my words): This is the standard formula appearing at the end of Phoenician and Punic votive inscriptions to explain the reason for devoting the object to the deity. The final word that usually appears '1l:T-of my words-has again been omitted. If McCarter's suggestion is accepted and we read 9YDN as 3DV the meaning here would be "the sound (of his words)." There are many comparable votive inscriptions, both Phoenician and Punic. The Phoenician com- paranda include, for example, such inscriptions as those from Seville, eighth century (Sola-Sole 1966; Gibson 1982: 64-66); Malta, sixth century (Gibson 1982: 72-77); Amrit, sixth century (?) (Segert 1976: 269 ?82, 33); and Umm el-'Amed, third century (Gibson 1982: 121-22). Punic examples include in- scriptions such as those from Cirta, Algeria, second century (Segert 1976: 277-78 ?85.32; 85.34) and Sardinia, second century (Segert 1976: 278 ?85.61). These inscriptions are usually based on a stan- dard formula consisting of five parts, which are, however, not always in the same order. The Mispe Yamim situla inscription does not conform exactly to this form, the reason almost certainly being the limited space available which made it necessary to make the inscription as short as possible.</page><page sequence="10">48 FRANKEL AND VENTURA BASOR 311 Plp ::' ?

Fig. 13. Situla-Phoenician inscription, letters 18-23. The inscriptions usually open by specifying the object to be devoted. In this inscription this part has been omitted. The standard second part consists of relative clause in which a verb, usually in the third person, is preceded by the relative pronoun W?, which. This is followed by the third part, the name of the devotee e.g., DM3 D W ( "which Nahum placed." In this inscription the relative pronoun was unnecessary because the object to be devoted had been omitted and the order of sections two and three was reversed-the inscription opened with the name of the devotee preceded by the ? of possession and followed by the verb, not in the third person as is usual, but in the first person. Part four, which in some cases appears at the beginning, is the deity's name preceded by a 5, "tolfor"; the final part explains the reason for the action by the phrase '1i11 =1 ?1 Y, "because she/he heard the sound of my words." In these two parts the situla inscription followed the standard formula, only omitting the last word. In this way a formula that is usually at least 12 words long has been reduced to the minimum, 8 words, 5 of which are parts of names thus making it possible to fit the inscription into the space available. Palaeography Fourteen of the letters of the alphabet appear in the inscription. As regards the palaeography also, the character of the inscription, the fact that it was engraved in metal in a very limited space explains its angularity and paradoxically perhaps also the preference in some cases for the cursive forms. Most of the letters are of the standard Phoenician forms that also often appear in the Aramaic script: bet (let- ters 4, 6, 8); dalet (letter 9); waw (letter 5); nun (let- ters 7, 13); Cayin (letters 2, 16, 19, 27); pe (letter 15); qop (letter 28) and res (letter 22). The letters that demand discussion are the following. 'alep (letters 10, 14): The 'alep, in which the cross lines do not converge to the left of the shaft, is common in Phoenician scripts although it is not found in Aramaic scripts. It is the usual form in the scripts of Cyprus and Byblos (Peckham 1968: pls.</page><page sequence="11">1998 THE MISPE YAMIM BRONZES 49 IL ; r- *:' ..~~Yu~''~~r llI~LHi~t ~?1aEI~gI ~ ?PF~~: L?~~i CI~~~: Ivy. Fig. 14. Situla-vertical Phoenician inscription, letters 24-29. 1-4) and in the cursive forms (Peckham 1968: 134- 36; pls. 10-11; Vanel 1967: tables 1, 2). It appears, however, in slightly varying forms. In the common form only the upper line crosses the shaft to the left. Rarely only the lower line crosses the shaft (e.g., Tyre [Schroeder 1885: 319, lines 5, 6]; Piraeus [CIS 19]; Sidon Ostraca A and D [Vanel 1967: table 1]). In the Mispe Yamim inscriptions both lines cross the shaft. This is also the case in CIS 112 from Abu Simbel (Ipsambul) and in inscriptions 5, 8, 11, 15, 19-23, 29, 32-33, 45, 50-51 from Abydos (Deren- bourg 1885: pls. 1-4). The forms of these letters are, however, also not identical; in both 'aleps from Mispe Yamim the lower line is significantly longer, apparently a unique form. kap (letters 3, 24): The two kaps differ as one has three arms and the other two. In both letters the arms are straight, as is the case in the early Phoenician forms, and lack the bends at the end of the arms typ- ical of the later Phoenician forms. The kap with two arms is that usually used in cursive script and also in Aramaic scripts. lamed (letters 1, 17, 18, 29): This letter appears four times and in all cases conforms to the early Phoenician form lacking the downstroke at the right of the crossline that is typical of the later Phoenician scripts. Again in the Aramaic script the early form continues later. mem (letters 12, 26): In both mems the upstroke to the left is missing. There do not appear to be par- allels to this variant. sin (letters 11, 20, 25): In the three examples of this letter the central arm is attached to the left arm and parallel to the right. This form appears in the Abu Simbel inscriptions (CIS 111) and at Abydos. It is also the cursive form and appears in Aramaic scripts. In the later Phoenician formal script there is usually an upstroke on the right. Fig. 15. Apis bull, profile. taw (letters 21, 23): Both examples of this letter consist of two strokes only, the early type, lacking the downward bend in the right arm typical of later forms. The contents and form of the inscription and the form of the 'alep clearly show the inscription to be in Phoenician, not Aramaic, script and within that context the forms of the kap, lamed, taw, and sin are all early. The closest parallels are the Abu Simbel and some of the Abydos inscriptions, the probable date being the sixth or fifth century B.C.E. As regards the situla it is very probable that it was produced in Egypt and that the inscription was added locally. APIS BULL (Inventory no. 87-1440), Height 7.5 cm, Length 7.8 cm (figs. 15-17) The bronze bull found at Mispe Yamim bears the following signs of the Apis:3 sun disk with frontal uraeus between the horns; triangular sign on the</page><page sequence="12">50 FRANKEL AND VENTURA BASOR 311 Fig. 16. Apis bull, three-quarter view. forehead; decorated ribbon around the neck; orna- mental "blanket" pattern on the back; two represen- tations of a winged "scarab," set before and behind the "blanket." These were a few among 29 distinc- tive signs by which a newborn bull was identified as Apis. If a black bull was born that possessed patches vaguely resembling these signs set in the right places, upon the death of the old Apis, it was chosen to become his successor. The bull from Mispe Yamim is not well proportioned and lacks accent in some of the characteristic curves of its body. Otherwise its posture is canonic. Like most of the specimens, it strides with left legs set forward, tail adhering to the inside of the right hind leg. The left hind leg was missing at the time of discovery, but was later found and restored. Viewed from the front, the horns are not sepa- rated but rather form a crescent-like continuity. This Fig. 17. Back of the Apis bull; scale, 1:1. (Drawing by P. Arad) feature is frequent in two-dimensional representa- tions of the Apis bull. The uraeus is badly made. Its lower part lacks the characteristic curvature and its head is rudimentary. The triangular sign on the forehead is set too close to the horns and is not centered perfectly. The "blanket" is composed of two rectangles decorated in a criss-cross pattern of small lozenges. It occupies the central part of the animal's back and sides. Its two patterned parts are separated by a narrow strip with medial line. Four pairs of small lines cross the medial line and apparently represent four cords that connected the two rectangular blankets. There are no fringes on the blanket. As for the winged "scarabs" (scarab with out- stretched vulture's wings), they are quite peculiar. They both have a pair of long antenna-like protru- sions at the front, which curve back to meet the extended wings. In both cases the "antennae" end in a brushlike feature achieved by the splitting of the antenna line into three or more "feelers." Had it not been for these un-Egyptian appendages, one would be safer to assume that they were winged sun disks. In fact, their bodies are almost round, and they do not have any of the known characteristics of Egyp- tian scarabs. The winged scarab, winged sun disk, and vulture, all celestial elements, are found inter- changeably as decorations of Apis bulls. Seen from above, a certain lack of symmetry is discerned. Uraeus, central point of the horns, diam- eters of the "scarabs," medial line of the "blanket," and tail are not on a straight line.</page><page sequence="13">1998 THE MISPE YAMIM BRONZES 51 Fig. 18. Recumbent ram, front. One assumes that the bull had been originally set upon a rectangular bronze base, which possibly bore an inscription. The break of one of the legs could have been provoked by the forceful separation of the animal from its supporting base. Figurines of the Apis bull possessed amuletic qualities and could guarantee progeny, fertility, and vigor. Their use was consequently widespread, and was not necessarily confined to sites of actual wor- ship of the Apis (the Memphite region in particular). An offering formula or a wish, mentioning the god and the name of the donor, was probably inscribed on the missing base. Such an inscription would in- dicate that the figurine had been offered as a token of devotion at a sacred place, in expectation of the fulfillment of the owner's wish. In this respect, the Apis bronze played a role similar to that of the sit- ula, near which it was discovered. It could well be a local imitation of the Egyptian prototype. RECUMBENT RAM (Inventory no. 87-1442), Height 4.6 cm, Length 6.1 cm, Weight 246.4 g (figs. 18-21) This figurine is represented in recumbent position with legs folded under its body and facing side- ways. Its ears are long, hiding the horns; its tail is large and reaches the ground. The space between the bent lower and upper parts of the legs is deeply molded. The figure is clearly a ram. Recumbent ruminants in similar form are common throughout the ancient Near East (Kozloff 1981: nos. 23, 24, 119; Muscarella 1974: no. 21) and this stance prob- ably originated in Mesopotamia (e.g., the example Fig. 19. Recumbent ram, back. from Warka, in the Protoliterate period [Heinrich 1936: pl. 6; Frankfort 1954: pl. 4A]). The long ears and large tail are realistic and typical of sheep in the region even today, but there is one anatomical mistake that also appears in the example from Warka. When ruminants recline with their legs folded be- neath the body, the hooves of the front legs are bot- tom side up while those of the back legs are bottom side down. In the ram finds from Mispe Yamim and Warka all the hooves are bottom side up. Four similar recumbent animals were part of the hoard of bronzes from the Persian period from Ash- kelon (Iliffe 1936: 68, pl. 34:4-7). These apparently included two bulls, a ram, and a lion; another lion was published from Tell Abu Hawam (Hamilton 1934: 18, no. 39). All these were hollow and filled with lead; they were without doubt meant as weights. The Mispe Yamim ram is apparently of pure bronze. There is, however, a smaller but identical bronze ram in the collection of the Eretz Israel Museum (Cata- logue No. K 8789, Height 33.50 mm, length 43.50 mm, weight 87.50 g).4 This makes it almost certain that both were also weights, parts of a standard series all in the same form but of different weights. PRANCING LION CUB (Inventory no. 87-1441), Height 4.7 cm, Length 8.6 cm (figs. 22-25). This feline is crouching on its haunches about to pounce. The face is deeply incised and the ears large</page><page sequence="14">52 FRANKEL AND VENTURA BASOR 311 Fig. 20. Recumbent ram from Eretz Israel Museum, front. Fig. 21. Recumbent ram from Eretz Israel Museum, back. and protruding. There is no molded mane but the incisions on neck and shoulders probably represent the mane of a young animal. The body is not care- fully molded, nor are the haunches distinguished. The large tail curls upwards and terminates in a large tuft. The figure is probably a male, the anus is marked but the sexual parts are hidden. The general proportions of the figurine suggest that it represents a young animal. There is a hole through the back showing that the figurine was originally attached to another object. It was perhaps the handle of a vessel although there are no signs of welding as would be expected in this case. The lion and the other felines are almost certainly the animals most frequently represented in ancient art and many different conventions developed re- garding both the stance of the animals and the man- ner in which certain parts such as the mane, the tail, and the face were portrayed (Richter 1930: 3-9; Ga- belman 1965; Rhyne 1985; Schweitzer 1948). The Mispe Yamim figurine, however, does not conform exactly to any of those conventions. In Iran during the Parthian and Sassanian periods lions appear in the very typical stance of the "flying gallop" (Ghirshman 1962: pls. 111, 356; Muscarella 1974: no. 164; Kozloff 1981: no. 330). Those exam- ples are very different from the Mispe Yamim lion cub in form and are certainly later in date, but they are similar to it in that they served as handles of various vessels. Since the Mispe Yamim bronzes are probably from the Persian period, when the region was part of the Achaemenian Empire centered in Iran, there may be some cultural connection. How- ever, there are also examples of lion figurines serving as handles in cultural milieux much farther away chronologically and geographically (Musca- rella 1974: no. 29; Kozloff 1981: no. 180). The stance of the Mispe Yamim prancing lion cub can, therefore, probably be explained by the purpose that it served as a handle or accessory of some other type-a use known in the region. Simi- larly the curling tail of the figurine is reminiscent of that of the striding lion that appears in Achaemenian art (Kozloff 1981: no. 31) and probably originated in Assyrian prototypes (Frankfort 1954: pls. 75a, b; 88; 108b). The figurine, however, is exceptional not only in form but also in that it represents a lion cub as opposed to the more usual lions, lionesses, and so- called panthers and leopards. As compared to many other regions-the Aegean world, for example, where the artists probably had very little opportunity to see actual lions-wild lions were almost certainly not uncommon in the region at this period (Bodenheimer 1935: 113). Comparison of the figurine to live lion cubs has shown the great likeness of the facial fea- tures to those of lion cubs 3-5 months old.5 We sug- gest, therefore, that this figurine was actually modeled on a live lion cub, probably at a local workshop, thus explaining its exceptional features. The lion in ancient art represented power and was usually a protective element, which explains the</page><page sequence="15">1998 THE MISPE YAMIM BRONZES 53 Fig. 22. Prancing lion cub. Fig. 23. Prancing lion cub. Fig. 24. Prancing lion cub. Fig. 25. Prancing lion cub. frequency of the appearance of the fierce-maned male. The playful Mispe Yamim lion cub clearly must have had quite another significance. CONCLUSIONS The four bronzes were found together; and although they were not retrieved during excava- tions, the position where they were found is clear and is to be associated with the final stages of the cult center at the site during the Hellenistic period. The fact that the missing leg of the Apis bull was found during the excavation in the Hellenistic layer 9 m away from where the bronzes were found re- moves any doubts that may have remained as re- gards to which layer the bronzes are connected. Two of the bronzes, however, are to be dated to the Persian period. As shown above, both the situla itself and the Phoenician inscription are almost cer- tainly from the Persian period and the parallels to the ram also cited above suggest that this figurine is also to be dated to that period. Thus the other two</page><page sequence="16">54 FRANKEL AND VENTURA BASOR 311 bronzes should probably also be assigned to the Persian period. Therefore we can but conclude that the four bronzes were originally associated with the temple of the Persian period, probably having been brought to it as votive gifts, and that in some way they were kept at the cult center till its final abandonment. The Apis bull was, however, clearly smashed, as was a green slate figurine of Osiris, Horus, and Isis found near the altar during the excavation (Frankel 1989/ 1990: fig. 88). This strongly suggests that these ob- jects, both representing Egyptian deities were dese- crated, perhaps by Hasmonean capturers of the site. If this is what actually happened, the fact that these and the other bronzes were left at the site and not removed would also be connected to their associa- tion with a pagan temple. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The excavations were carried out under the auspices of the Institute of Archaeology of Haifa University with the aid of a grant from the National Council for Research and Development attached to the Israel Ministry of Research and Development. Noga Blockman and A. Cohen were area supervisors and N. Getzov was area supervisor and surveyor. Help was also received from the Merom Ha-Galil regional council, the Western Galilee Field School of the Israel Society for the Protection of Nature, and Kibbutz Parod and Moshav Kefar Shammay. The situla was drawn by Florika Wainer; the Apis bull by Penina Arad, the photographs taken by A. Hai and by photographers of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem, and, with the assistance of Rebekah Martin Nagy, also by the photographers of the North Carolina Museum of Art. The bronzes are today on permanent loan from the Israel Antiquities Authority to the Israel Museum. We thank all concerned. NOTES 1This paper was mentioned by Cauville (1982-1983: 137, n. 1) but D.
