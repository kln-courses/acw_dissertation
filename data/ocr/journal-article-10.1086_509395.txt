      <p>At first glance, this is yet another book that describes man’s ill‐treatment of animals, but this volume is distinguished by its focus on the underlying physiology, with only limited description of the practices. There is much less attention on behavior, but this may be in part because there has been greater experimentation on animal physiology in relation to suffering than animal behavior. Much is borrowed from human literature and animal models of human disorders in the quest to identify the underlying physiology. In most cases, this is quite legitimate and even desirable, because the author acknowledges that many unethical experiments were conducted in elucidating the physiological mechanisms, which might be better justified if greater use is made of the knowledge gained. An exception may be the extrapolation from human mental disorders, which are quite unique because of our high level of cerebralization compared to animals where there is often little evidence that they suffer in the same way. In the future, this is likely to be a major field of anthropomorphic exploration.</p>
      <p>An almost impossibly broad subject matter is covered, but the author’s systematic, physiological approach to suffering means that most areas relevant to at least farm animals are considered, even if there is less consideration of companion, laboratory, and zoo animals. There are some notable omissions (e.g., lead in the chapter on poisoning), but the focus on farm animals and in particular the underlying physiology, as well as the breadth of coverage, means that the book will be invaluable for veterinary students. Their interest in animal welfare should be enhanced by a careful consideration of the issues. The volume will also be of value to anyone interested in animal cruelty, since proving cruelty usually requires evidence that the animal has suffered unnecessary pain. The excellent chapter on pain, which again borrows heavily from literature on humans, is a rare insight into the potential impact of the many mutilations used by stockpeople to make animals fit their farming systems. Topical issues (such as whaling, mulesing, and trapping) are all considered, and the author does not shirk from drawing contentious conclusions on the levels of suffering that the animals are subjected to.</p>
      <p>In summary, this book is a mixture of practical advice related to the management of welfare issues (e.g., factors predisposing horses to lameness) and theoretical discussion of the underlying physiology. Readers should be aware that most of the issues are complex and there is insufficient space to consider them in detail. The author is to be commended for traversing the tightrope of anthropomorphism with grace and alacrity in this novel approach. It should help veterinary students develop a keen interest in animal welfare, and it may even benefit animals if we can use Gregory’s ideas to begin to unravel the physiology of animal suffering.</p>
