This massive, magisterial, and difficult work studies the problems and processes of visualizing the divine in the traditions of medieval Jewish mysticism. Elliot R. Wolfson has amassed an impressive array of texts to establish the foundational importance of seeing God for Jewish mysticism-well beyond that perceived or acknowledged in previous scholarship-and his book formulates many questions that will undoubtedly oc- cupy subsequent investigators as they grapple with the significance of its findings. As he traces the history of the idea-from the participation in the enthronement of the divine glory on its supernal chariot recorded in the Hekhalot texts of the early medieval Near East, to the "complicated interweaving of the threads of phi- losophy and mysticism" (p. 187) among pre-Mai- monidean and pre-Kabbalistic Jewish theologians (Saadiah Gaon, Shabbetai Donnolo, Judah Halevi, and others), to the attempts of German-Jewish Pietists to reconcile received anthropomorphic traditions and aniconic strictures of contemporary rationalist philos- ophy, and, finally to the flowering of theosophic Kab- balah in Provence and Spain in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries (manifested above all in the Zo- har)-the impassioned drive to encounter and unite with the divine through sensory, primarily visual expe- rience emerges as a central and organizing theme in the development of Jewish mysticism. Wolfson's reconsideration of medieval Jewish mys- ticism sheds new light on numerous related issues that have long engaged its modern scholars: the nature and formation of the Hekhalot compositions; the transi- tional role of Ashkenazic Pietism in the development AMERICAN HISTORICAL REVIEW JUNE 1996</page><page sequence="2">Medieval 825 of mystical theosophy; and the relationship between revelation, ecstasy, and theosophy in the emergence of high medieval Kabbalah. Of particular importance is the erotic imagery of Jewish mystical experience, em- ployed to describe both the perceived deity and the process whereby the mystic perceives him. Yet most engaging for me were an array of theoretical and methodological questions that contribute to the direc- tion, coherence, and significance of Wolfson's analysis. To what extent ought one to evaluate the mystical experience-in this case, visualizing God-as a cross- cultural religious phenomenon, or should it be viewed in terms of a specific historical, cultural, and herme- neutical context? How formative are received tradi- tions, oral and textual, in determining the nature of mystical experience and in precipitating it? What objective status has the mystical vision of the divine- veridical/ontological or docetic/psychological-given the critical role of human imagination in achieving such vision? What is the precise relationship between the ontological, "what is conceived of metaphysically as the ultimate nature of being," and the phenomeno- logical, "what is experienced in the mystical experience of illumination" (p. 270)? Where, precisely, ought one to distinguish between anthropomorphism, attributing human traits to the deity, and theomorphism, regard- ing humans in divine terms? Not surprisingly, Wolfson's survey culminates in the sefirotic Kabbalah of the Zohar; as such, Zoharic mysticism mediates between many of the oppositional pairs just enumerated. As the proper mystical study of God's law facilitates the visualization of God, the Zohar equates the object of that study with God himself. Hermeneutics thus becomes the phenomenol- ogy of experience. Ontological and phenomenological poles of mystical experience converge, as the term zohar itself refers both to the deity and to the enlight- ened state achieved by the contemplative kabbalist. Theomorphism and anthropomorphism converge as well, as do the ostensibly polar opposites of objectively existent and imaginary in the kabbalistic vision: "The corporeal figuration of the divine is not to be taken either literally or metaphorically; it is symbolic and as such allows the formless to be manifest in form, but only within the imagination" (p. 325). The erotic tendencies of Jewish mystical symbolism likewise reach their full maturity in the Zohar, whose Kabbalah Wolfson terms both phallocentric and homoerotic; for "the focal point of the visual encounter [between kabbalist and deity] is the male organ [in the sefirotic anatomy of God]," and "the singular bond that con- nects the male deity and male worshiper is the penis" (p. 370). This book comprises a manifold contribution to our appreciation of Jewish mysticism and Jewish intellec- tual history in the Middle Ages. Wolfson generally articulates his controversial opinions responsibly and convincingly. He has followed the Israeli scholar Moshe Idel in arguing-and demonstrating-the value of a phenomenological, structuralist perspective in the study of mystical texts and ideas in Judaism; yet he continues to advocate a "modified contextualism," acknowledging that "the interpretative framework of a mystic's particular religion shapes his or her experi- ence at the phenomenal level and not merely in the description or narrative account of the experience" (p. 54). Nevertheless, historians may well feel short- changed by the limited attempts to evaluate varieties of mystical texts and experiences against the back- ground of specific sociocultural contexts. They may also find Wolfson's numerous, fascinating, but at times repetitive discussions of the eroticisms of Jewish mys- ticism-without a concomitant effort to assess their broader theological and cultural significance, as if exposing the erotic were itself a major goal of this investigation-slightly sensationalistic. Finally, they will certainly not find this book easy to read. Wolfson understates the case in his introduction, where he notes that "this monograph is not a textbook" (p. 10). To the contrary, it is a sophisticated critical enterprise, rife with technical terms and terminologies, many of these cultural-specific or drawn from the highly spe- cialized vocabulary of analytic philosophy and reli- gious phenomenology. Without a grounding in Jewish mysticism, many will find this book intimidating, if not inaccessible. In directing his work to the initiated, however, Wolfson has perhaps remained true to the esoteric character of his subject, evidencing the ten- sion in yet one more dialectical pair: the medieval kabbalist and his modern historian.
