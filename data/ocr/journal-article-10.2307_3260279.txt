<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews the editors note, one would have expected klhm and klhn. The clear enclitic mem on smy-m, "my name" (1. 11, = Assyrian sumi-ma [1. 16]) is equally intriguing. I once thought that sqrtm (Sf III 4, 7, 16, 23) might be a 2d sg. form with such an enclitic (JAOS 86 [1966] 295-96) but later reverted to the 2d. pl. explanation of A. Dupont- Sommer (The Aramaic Inscriptions of Sefire [Rome: Biblical Institute, 1967] 107), because the enclitic mem was nowhere else attested in Aramaic and people were seeing enclitic mems all over Hebrew, etc. Perhaps now one should reconsider the Sefire forms. In 1. 16 Hadad is described as ysb skn mr' hbwr, "dwelling at Sikan, the Lord of (the) Habur." If hbwr is meant here as the name of a region (and not of the river), is it possible that one should restore Sf I A 4 with w'dy hb[wr .. .], "and the treaty of (the) Hab[ur ...]"? Some minor corrections: Assyrian inscription, 1. 5 (p. 13): read PAP instead of PAB; 1. 35 (p. 14): P. 21, 1. 10: for "que le lit," read "que leur lit"; 1. 15: for "dans la fosse a ordures," read "dans les fosses ...." P. 46,11. 12-13: Is slh certainly fem. sg. absol.? I doubt it. Finally, this Aramaic inscription has, indeed, given us a new type of Old Ara- maic, but one that is still in the vast majority of the forms similar to the rest of Old Aramaic inscriptions. It remains, however, to be seen whether one can on the basis of it speak of a distinction between western and eastern Aramaic in this early period (pace the editors, J. C. Greenfield, et al.

Pp. 298. $5.95 (paper). This popular presentation of OT theology is designed for beginning students and interested laity and offers the scholarly results of biblical criticism in a manner acceptable to the theology of protestant evangelicals. The topics of consideration- revelation, nature of God, sin, redemption, eschatology, and worship practice- reflect the theological disposition of author and audience. The approach evaluates significant vocabulary in order to penetrate the thought structure of ancient Israel. Cate commits himself to a synthesis of OT and NT thought by showing how the latter developed out of the former at many points. However, he may compromise his critical methodology by moving too quickly at times to NT understandings without giving full credit to OT insights. The more advanced student may not discover any- thing new in this work, and he or she may be critical of the author's approach. But one must respect Cate's attempt to communicate authentic biblical insights without alienating the theological sensitivities of his audience. Robert Gnuse Loyola University, New Orleans, LA 70118 The Dethronement of Sabaoth. Studies in the Shem and Kabod Theologies, by Tryggve N. D. Mettinger. ConBOT 18. Lund: Gleerup, 1982. Pp. 158. SwK 70. The central question which Mettinger addresses is the following: why is "the 267</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Biblical Literature central and typical divine title employed in the Temple theology of the Jerusalem cult tradition"-YWHW segbaot-replaced in the deuteronomistic and priestly mate- rials, and Ezekiel, by the sem and kibod theologoumena respectively? His thesis is that this replacement-or, more suggestively, "dethronement"-was a result of "cog- nitive dissonance" created by the exilic situation in which the concept of the enthronement of Yahweh in the temple was no longer tenable. In chap. 1 Mettinger presents an overview of the "Zion-Sabaoth theology of the Jerusalem cult tradition," with its central concept of "the enthroned God." The iconographic expressions of this concept include the cherubim, whose outspread wings form a throne for the deity, and the ark, which constitutes a footstool for the throne. This cultic assemblage is closely associated with what Mettinger sees as the "original and complete title" YHWH seba'ot yoseb hakkerubzm, in which the central expression for the divine presence is the word yasab. Mettinger argues that there is no inherent tension within the concept of God's presence in the temple (e.g., heavenly/earthly or transcendent/ immanent), but that the Israelite view of the temple represents a concept of "unity or identity" in which "the category of space is transcended." "Here the distinction is obliterated between the heavenly and the earthly, in that both are subsumed under a higher mystical identity" (p. 30). Turning to the relation between the temple tradi- tion of divine presence and the theophanic traditions (i.e., divine self-revelations which emphasize "God's movement to or from a place" accompanied by various meteorological phenomena), Mettinger asserts that "the enthroned King and the coming God" were originally "two diametrically opposed aspects of God," but that they were combined into "a complementary, rather than contradictory, relationship" within the temple theology, and thus "are by no means to be played off against each other" (p. 36). Having sketched the theology and iconography of the temple cult, Mettinger now proceeds in the next two chapters to discuss the "name theology" of the deuteronomistic school and the kabod theology of P and Ezekiel. Although Mettinger allows for "a pre- Dtr history" beginning with Hezekiah, he asserts that the first basic edition comes from the period no earlier than 597 B.C.E. and probably not before 586 (p. 38, n. 1; p. 41). After reviewing the various biblical name formulae and the critical work on them (von Rad; McBride; Terrien; de Vaux; van der Woude, and others), Mettinger launches his own analysis. He argues that there is, in fact, a systematic "name theology" in the deuteronomistic history which is a deliberate correction to the Zion-Sabaoth the- ology. Whereas the latter is anthropomorphic (viz., enthronement), D is "abstract;" whereas "heaven and earth were conjoined in the Temple," D emphasizes the transcen- dence of God (pp. 46-47). Similarly, the deuteronomistic rendition of the ark and cher- ubim represents a "conscious suppression of the notion of the God who sat enthroned in the Temple" (p. 51). For evidence, Mettinger focuses on 1 Kgs 8:14-66, as well as other texts (e.g., 2 Sam 7:5, 13). He claims that the development of the deuteronomistic name theology fits within the exilic situation because "the Name theology presents us with a transcendent God who is invulnerable to any catastrophe which might conceivably affect his Temple" (p. 50). Mettinger can find no systematic name theology in the origi- nal Deuteronomy, although there are instances of lesakken sem (12:21) which antedate both the D history and the exile. However, Mettinger speculates that even this seminal development of the name theology occurred in the years after 597 (p. 61; there is also no evidence for a pre-exilic name theology in Jeremiah, [pp. 62-66]). Finally, Mettinger 268</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews suggests that the "dethronement of Sabaoth" expressed in the name theology is also mirrored liturgically in the shift in emphasis from the autumn festival to passover which occurred during the Josianic era. The shift represents a move from the mythical concept of divine kingship (Chaoskampf and creation) to one of Heilsgeschichte (exo- dus and formation of a people). In chap. 3 Mettinger turns to the Kabod theology in P and Ezekiel. He concludes that the priestly tabernacle is distinguished from the old tent traditions in that P does not use the verb yarad for God, and thus "there is no suggestion of a divine descent" (p. 87). Similarly, P avoids using the verb yisab for God, and the ark and cherubim no longer serve as expressions for enthronement. Mettinger disputes the widespread view that skn connotes impermanence, in contrast to ysb. Rather, he argues that the only difference lies in the connotation of enthronement which may accrue to ysb, but never to skn. Thus, for P the kabod is "constantly present in the tabernacle," but God is not enthroned there, and this development, like that of the D name theology, is best "explained by the situation of the Exile" (pp. 96-97). In contrast, "the kiibd concept in Ezekiel is closer to the enthroned God of the Zion-Sabaoth theology than is the idea represented by the P-materials" (p. 106). Nevertheless it is the Glory of the Lord, and not the Lord of Hosts, who is the subject of enthronement. Moreover, the kibbd now "functions as a name of God" rather than an attribute (p. 107). The Sabaoth title was rejected because it was "anomalous, perhaps even theologically inconsistent" with the idea of "God [who] abandons his dwelling because of the people's sin" (p. 109). On the other hand, kiibd fits well with this idea because of its associations with "the coming of God" of the theophanic tradition (now inverted in Ezekiel to represent a departure; pp. 116-23). Finally, in chap. 4, Mettinger suggests a basic difference between the kiibd theology of P and the name theology of D: "in the former, kibod stands for God himself, while in the latter there is ultimately a difference between God's being in heaven and the presence of his Name in the Temple" (p. 124). The name may be understood as a "(semi-)hypostasis" (pp. 129-32). Mettinger's work is rigorous and thorough, making ample use of the major rele- vant works. He has made a number of suggestions which deserve further attention (e.g., his study of skn). However, his thesis is undermined by numerous questions. Everything hangs on his dating of the relevant portions of the D history and P to the exilic period. Some of Mettinger's traditio-historical moves compound the general problem of dating, such as his assertion that much of Exodus 15 (including divine kingship) "presupposes the Zion-Sabaoth theology," and that the combination of theophany and divine kingship is relatively late, as is the connection between exodus and Passover. Aside from dating, there are a number of places where Mettinger forces texts to yield a meaning consistent with his thesis. It is not immediately clear, for example, why the failure to mention the cherubim in Deut 10:1-5 suggests an attempt to dethrone the Lord of Hosts, nor why in 1 Kgs 8:1-11 the D historian could not fail to mention the cherubim, making their inclusion insignificant (p. 51; cf. on Deut 5:4, 22 and 33:26, p. 48). Larger problems stem from questionable presuppositions or assumptions which are not argued. Is it all that obvious that the Jerusalem cult theology held a naive view that God was fully present in the temple, especially when we know that even the statues of other deities did not guarantee their real presence (cf. the "abandonment motif" in Akkadian texts)? Similarly, in my judgment Mettinger does not give sufficient credence to those who argue that the deuteronomic representations of divine name, ark, and temple constitute a different 269</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Biblical Literature way of construing divine presence suitable for different theological agendas other than "demythologization" (so McBride and de Vaux). Why does the presence of God's name (especially as an hypostasis) in the temple make God invulnerable when the temple is destroyed? Why is it obvious that the Sabaoth title is incompatible with the concept of divine abandonment in the face of sin? While these and other ques- tions remain, Mettinger has given us a fresh and challenging treatment of some major issues on OT theology. Future studies of the sem and kibod theologoumena will have to pay attention to this book. Thomas W. Mann Converse College, Spartanburg, SC 29301 Des Schiffes Weg mitten im Meer. Beitrige zur Erforschung der nautischen Termi- nologie des Alten Testaments, by Eva Stromberg Krantz. ConBOT 19. Lund: Gleerup, 1982. Pp. 225. SwK 80. The nautical terminology of the Bible has not attracted many investigations. Only two studies have previously examined this subject-those of A. Abraham and R. Patai-and both are now dated. The latter is not listed by Krantz. This reviewer's unpublished Brandeis University doctoral dissertation-Maritime Activity in Ancient Israel (1971)-which compiled a glossary of over one hundred nautical terms in the Hebrew Bible, with cognates, was utilized by Krantz. After the Introduction, the nautical terms are analyzed in four sections, dealing with (I) Types of Ships, (II) Parts of Ships, (III) Shipbuilding Timber and Ship Con- struction, and (IV) Naval Personnel. The brief conclusions are followed by a bibliogra- phy, and indices of biblical and all ancient sources and terms. The photomechanically reproduced typescript, translated into German by Ch. Boehncke Sjoberg, is accompa- nied by fifteen illustrations of ships and their parts, derived from Egyptian and other ancient monuments. The careful linguistic discussion by Krantz is amply annotated. It seeks to elucidate the meaning of some forty selected nautical terms in the Hebrew Bible, including sev- eral hapax legomena, by etymology, nominal pattern study and cognate comparisons. Some pertinent evidence from ancient representations of ships is included, as well as the recent discoveries by marine archaeologists, which serve to enhance the discussion of several terms. Others, like doberot (1 Kgs 5:23), paralleled by rapsodot (1 Chr 2:15), and silsal (Isa 18:1), whose meanings are determined by context and the Versions, still defy a satisfactory philological explanation. Excluded from the investigation are the nautical terms dealing with coastlands, harbors, winds and waves. The work is flawed by overlooking the data gathered in R. Patai's Jewish Sea- faring in Ancient Times (in Hebrew; Jerusalem: Bialik, 1938). Thus, the author's long discussion of hibbel concludes with a solution already proposed by Patai and Stieglitz. At times, Krantz is curiously out of date. Glueck's identification of Ezion- Geber/Elath with Tell el Kheleifeh is noted, but not the later, and more convincing studies of B. Rothenberg on Ezion-Geber = Jezirat Far'aun. Tell el Kheleifeh, indeed, is a site totally unsuitable for a seaport. Minor shortcomings are apparent in the treatment of sea-purple, and in this connection it is regrettable that the author did not include biblical references to fishermen and their tools. 270</page></plain_text>
