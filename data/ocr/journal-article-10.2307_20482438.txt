Liquids were released through this secondary opening in a manner closely controlled by its small size; hence the name rhyton (p5E'W, pVTOV) for the whole class. The long-awaited magnum opus of Robert Koehl is a first-class presentation and discussion of the material. It will be the first point of consultation and the standard work for a long time, well written and, where necessary, well argued; it is a model of how to use and build on earlier work without overtrumpeting convincing new proposals. The book is well organised, with an excellently detailed catalogue of 1,340 Aegean pieces and 44 imports or imitations from Egypt, western Asia and Cyprus as its core, followed by full discussion and catalogues of representations of rhyta on frescoes, seals and sealings, pottery and Linear A and B texts. Discussion is firmly supported by 29 statistical tables which provide a database of every aspect of typology and context. There is a wide-ranging bibliography (28 pages in double columns). A comprehensive selection of pieces is illustrated by excellent technical drawings and photographs of good quality. The catalogues (Chapter 2) are followed by a chapter on the mechanical functions, especially the different filling methods for different types, particularly by immersion into the required liquid (an argument against blood as one of the liquids?); the discussion greatly benefits from K.'s experiments with reproduction rhyta. Designs are demonstrated to be well suited to collecting pure liquids, by filtering away or straining off solid matter (lees, remains of herbs or spices) by filling at the small opening or through a cloth over the mouth at the primary opening. Discussion of uses (Chapter 4) derives directly from these practical considerations; uses are examined by site type, date and Aegean location. On the question of secular vs ritual use one may add that filling through the small opening by immersion seems very elaborate for a purely practical (secular) function, while the formation in this way of a special liquid in limited quantities for ritual purposes is entirely plausible. Next comes a series of special topics, rhyta in Minoan tholos tombs, in peak sanctuaries, in (ritual) processions, on use in relation to gender, on rhyta and priests, particularly the iconographical evidence in the Minoan case, distribution in relation to cemetery size in the Mycenaean period (including Late Minoan II-III B Crete), and finally on rhyta in contexts outside the Aegean. The summary and conclusions (Chapter 5) are written on the basis of chronological periods. Until now the basic typological and functional study of rhyta as a whole has been Karo's article 'Minoische rhyta' in JdI 26 (1911), 249-70. It does not much matter what typology is used, provided it is clearly explained. K., following Karo, selects the size of the primary opening as one of his two main criteria: narrow (3-5 cms internal diameter, Types I-II) or wide (normally over 10 cms, Types III-IV). The distinction is critical; 'narrow' mouths can be covered by thumb or finger, 'wide' mouths not; therefore different filling mechanisms are needed (p. 264 illustration 11 for filling 'narrow' ovoids). The second criterion is the presence (Types I, IV) or absence (II, III) of a foot or feet; footed includes flat bases (i.e. not feet as such) to make a vessel free-standing. Zoomorphs come in Type I (whole body), II and III (head and neck only). Type IV: Figural includes twenty skeuomorphs, pithoi, flowerpots, baskets, buckets and boots, often as small-scale imitations. The Early Minoan origins of rhyta (pp. 11, 13-5) are local and lie in a complex relationship, perhaps not yet fully understood, with zoomorphic and (usually female) anthropomorphic vessels which are not rhyta. The Koumasa tombs, Lebena tomb</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 253 II (Early Minoan I contexts) and the Myrtos-Phournou Koryphe and Pyrgos settlements are the critical sites for these zoomorphics. The only essential difference is the presence or absence of a secondary opening. This difference is however critical, since the secondary opening implies specific ritual (libation) functions and the beliefs behind them. At present the first rhyta date from Early Minoan II. In addition to the special topics listed above, two others, the first frequently referred to through the text, merited being brought together as further short essays. (1) K. rightly sees libation as the main function of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic and other types, with wine or wine and water as the likeliest substance used. The controlled outflow of liquid through the small secondary opening would mean urTov8&amp;s rather than xoESs in Classical Greek terms (see W Burkert, Greek Religion. Archaic and Classical [1985], pp. 70-3). K. (p. 328) argues for libations as accompa niments of animal sacrifices, perhaps also as a part of toasting rituals. But what was the purpose of the libations and to whom were they made? He suggests that they constituted an element of rituals to promote the fertility and prosperity of the household (p. 309). In Classical times (Burkert ibid.) a preliminary libation of wine was made to the gods from jugs or bowls (never from rhyta) whenever wine was drunk; in animal sacrifices it was made, again to the gods, at the end of the ritual. Libations (honey, wine, water) perceived as the earth drinking the liquid were for the dead and for chthonic gods. An oil libation or anointment of special stones could have a Bronze Age origin (Odyssey 3. 406-1 1, at the palace of Nestor). All these purposes are likely for the Bronze Age, probably too with beliefs in divine recipients. As a minimum one could say that the general purpose was to validate or seek validation of a particular action or ritual (sacrifice and other rituals, household or communal drinking, for the dead or for special purposes such as anointment). The millions of small conical cups used by the Minoans would be partly explicable if a small libation was made and the cup discarded each time wine or even water was drunk. (2) Rhyta were made in a variety of materials, most commonly clay but also faience, ostrich egg, gold, silver and attractive stones of many kinds; the remarkable piece from the Dendra tholos, no. 186 (pp. 100, 364), is an ostrich egg rhyton fitted with faience, gilded bronze, gold and silver. Given this variety of materials, discussion of them as such is merited. There must have been a consequently wide variation of ascribed value, in proportion to the nature (mundane to exotic) of the material, its distance from source and the level of technical manufacturing skill required to transform it into a rhyton. This applies above all to some of the astonishing achievements in hard stones, such as the rock crystal ovoid rhyton (with bronze and gold fittings) from the Zakros Shrine Treasury (no. 87). A high proportion of the finest stone vessels are in fact rhyta or chalices or imitation shells, all used in rituals. K. rightly observes (e.g. at p. 310) that such pieces are confined to palatial cult repositories, with occasional singletons elsewhere. Such implied variation of value is an indirect indication either of social hierarchy, with differential access to raw materials, or to the ascribed status of religion, centred on the palaces and with the richest materials being dedicated to ritual usage, or to both. For value in relation to stone vessels see A. Bevan, Stone Vessels and Values in the Bronze Age Mediterranean (Cambridge, 2007). Some details. Pp. 20-1: I agree with K. that the anthropomorphic 74 from Phaistos (perhaps a male priest) is LM I B, not later. 22, 27: K. argues convincingly that the origin of piriform and globular rhyta did not lie in (Egytian) ostrich eggs. When the latter were used, later than the first clay rhyta, details suggest they were</page><page sequence="4">254 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW copying those earlier vessels. These and other geometric forms originated among the brilliantly inventive potters of the Protopalatial Period. 38-9: Notwith standing K.'s. detailed comments it is not easy to see nos 345-8 as imitations of poppy capsules; the flat top of actual capsules is entirely closed, the opposite of open-mouthed rhyta; nos 345-8 would easily fit within the range of variation of Type III Piriform. 41: Type III Head-shaped: zoomorphic - a good discussion of Anatolian derivation, though it is very much open to question whether Phaistos was the birthplace of this Minoan form in Middle Minoan III; Phaistos was in a disturbed state in that period, with no palace. 47 right column: for Prepalatial read Protopalatial. 179: nos 752-3. For lapis lacedaemonius read rosso antico. 246 sqq.: Since every Aegean head-shaped zoomorph is represented in Egyptian eighteenth Dynasty tomb paintings, plus the griffin, K., following Kantor, argues that the latter is likely to have existed in rhyton form in the Aegean. 267: Pace K. I rather share Rehak's scepticism about the carrying of a filled Head-shaped bull rhyton, 6 kg in total (equals three full two-litre plastic water bottles) with extended arms at chest/waist level, even by K.'s 'well toned young men'. Perhaps they were filled only at the ceremonial locus. 281-3: On the association of rhyta with wine in rituals it is a nice thought of K.'s. that miniature pithos-rhyta were for wine libations celebrating the grape harvest or the opening of the pithoi after fermentation (cf. Classical I7tolyta at the Anthesteria). 288: In House Cm Room 58 at Gournia there were fourteen rhyta inside and round a pithos. It is hard to believe that so many were needed if they were merely practical utensils. K. rightly proposes a cult repository. This means that Type III Conicals (wide mouth) were used in cult. 303: no. 74. For Type II read Type I. 329: Bull rhytons are painted white, their nets or coverlets red. The argument that these rhyta symbolise bulls for sacrifice is supported by the white painted bull in relief on the Anemospelia bucket, surely a container for the blood of a sacrificed bull. 334-5: Rhyta and loomweights. In agreement with the discussion a further point against loomweights (in these contexts) being immediately connected with textiles, i.e. the context was or included a textile workshop, is the fact that in the Knossos Stratigraphical Museum Extension site Late Minoan I B deposit there was great variation in the weights of the 79 examples, i.e. they were not directly associable with looms. 348 (and 242): WA1 5, an electrum conical rhyton from Ugarit, looks very close to Late Minoan I stone forms. 357: A very interesting suggestion that all ostrich egg rhyta were made on Thera and exported from there to Crete and the mainland. 359: K. attributes to the reviewer anthropophagy as the primary ritual behind the Knossos LM I B (see above) deposit of children's bones with cut marks. This needs modifying; I proposed human sacrifice as the primary ritual, with subsequent consumption of the cooked flesh as a clear additional possibility on the evidence. 360: no. 567, read LH II A.
