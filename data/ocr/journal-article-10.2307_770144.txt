<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN STODART KENNEDY 15 May 1912-4 February 1993 Elected F.R.S. 1965 BY JOHN BRADY Department of Biology, Imperial College of Science, Technology &amp; Medicine, Silwood Park, Ascot, Berkshire SL5 7PY When his mother, vexed at his frequent inactivity, asked him what he had been doing, the young JOHN KENNEDY would truthfully reply, 'Contemplating'. This became a mark of his science in later years; he thought about evidence and inference a great deal, in a subject area riddled with sloppy anthropomorphic deduction - the study of animal behaviour. He was the son of an itinerant Scottish engineer and an American mother, who met in Bangkok, where Kennedy senior was the tramway manager and she was visiting a mis- sionary aunt. His background was strongly religious, both parents were devoutly C. of E. Indeed, his great-grandfather, the Revd John Kennedy M.A., D.D., left the Kirk of Scotland, disillusioned by its laxity, to join the evangelically more active Congregationalists. Nothing obvious in Kennedy's childhood directed him into biology; neither he nor any of his forbears showed any interest in natural history. But the intellectual roots of his subse- quent science are clearly discernible: a great-grandfather who was an outstanding religious orator, one great-uncle who was Professor of Greek and a well-known reformer at Edinburgh University, another who was President of the Institution of Civil Engineers, and a father who was a qualified engineer. No doubt the women in this background were of comparable intel- lectual stature, but in the nature of the times, were not offered the opportunity to mark their abilities so formally. EDUCATION In reality, Kennedy's childhood was less than ideal for nurturing his intellectual develop- ment: frequent changes of home, from Pennsylvania (where he was born) to Hong Kong, to Philadelphia, to Toronto; all before he was seven. Thereafter, he was brought up in England, still in several places, and with five school changes between six and sixteen, until at last his parents settled in Hampstead and he was sent to Westminster School as a day-boy. He always said he felt he had no 'proper' roots. Westminster made him a biologist. There, bored with classics, at which he excelled, he ? 1995 The Royal Society 245</page><page sequence="2">Jkl EL</page><page sequence="3">Biographical Memoirs chose to switch to biology in the sixth form, and fell under the joint influence of the charm of life under the microscope, and the enthusiasm of a part-time biology master, George Pickering (later Sir George, F.R.S.). University College, London (UCL) followed, and initiation through the inspirational teaching of J.B.S. Haldane, F.R.S. to the then revolutionary 'mechanist' approach to biology, and by G.P. Wells (son of H.G., and later F.R.S.) who introduced him to the strictly mecha- nistic, so-called 'behaviourist' approach to animal behaviour. This hotbed of rationalist thinking, and long discussions with contemporaries such as M.J.D. White (later F.R.S.), awoke in Kennedy a deep scepticism of the still current 'vitalist' approach to biology - and of religion - and led to a passion for social justice. Like many intellectuals in the 1930s, he recoiled from the Fascist horrors in Europe into the arms of Marxism. This political enthusiasm deflected his academic progress somewhat (not for the last time), and he received an upper second class degree rather than the first for which he had been tipped. Nevertheless, armed with a ?50 Derby Scholarship, he stayed on at UCL to work for an M.Sc. on the reflexes of the blowfly, supervised by a recent refugee from Hitler's Germany, G.S.Fraenkel, another behaviourist (though less 'radical' than G.P.Wells). By one of those curious circles that direct one's life, Kennedy dropped out of the entomology course at Imperial College (which UCL undergraduates often followed) because he found the classical morphology 'utterly boring', but was to return there 30 years later as a Professor of, in effect, insect behaviour. Indeed, from his M.Sc. onwards, behaviour in general, and insect behaviour in particular, was to fascinate him; and he worked on it quite literally until his dying day. FAMILY He married his first wife, Dorothy Bartholomew, in 1936. The marriage was not a happy one, however, and Kennedy spent most of the time abroad from 1939 to 1946, when they finally divorced. They had a son, David, who followed in his father's socialist footsteps, though in a more down-to-earth sense; by 1970 he was the youngest ever Father of the craft printers' trade union Chapel at The Times. In 1986 he was sacked, along with the other employees who had been on strike against the introduction of automation, when Rupert Murdoch transferred production of the paper from Fleet Street to Wapping. A meeting set up by a mutual friend led to John's second marriage, to Dr Claudette Bloch, a young French scientist working at the Sorbonne, a fellow zoologist and communist. Widowed by the Gestapo, she was then still recovering from four years in Auschwitz. They married in Paris in 1950, and she brought her ten-year-old, French-speaking son, Maurice, with her to Cambridge. Maurice coped well with English schools, however, and in due course became Professor of Anthropology at the L.S.E. This time, the marriage was well-matched, a deeply satisfying partnership both domesti- cally and intellectually. They had two children: James, an Oxford maths graduate, who worked for the Coal Board and then at the Audit Commission; and Cathy, who followed her father's steps into biology, with a Ph.D. from Leicester in psychology and a Demonstratorship in zoology at Oxford, later becoming Commissioning Editor in biology for Oxford University Press. The Kennedy home was always welcoming, and Claudette's hospitality superb. Their house was a stopping-off point for numerous visiting academics, helping to create a stimu- 246</page><page sequence="4">John Stodart Kennedy lating intellectual atmosphere. One could imagine that the Kennedy household was like the houses of the Huxleys of an earlier generation. Their summer picnics with their games of 'Pope', and their Christmas charades parties were legendary. Into the latter, the initially inno- cent families of their colleagues were tipped willy-nilly, to enact wordless playlets, whose literary and political satire grew increasingly extravagant as the evening progressed. CAREER Work on locusts Kennedy's M.Sc. left him qualified, but potentially careerless in the aftermath of the Great Depression. Scientific jobs came only in the form of short-term contracts (plus Ca change) to work on insects of economic importance. The first was for three years at the University of Birmingham, a Ph.D. project under D.L. Gunn on the reactions of locusts to temperature and humidity. The money was arranged by B.P. Uvarov, F.R.S., a Russian acaridologist of great distinction brought out of Georgia by P.A. Buxton, F.R.S., (later Head of Entomology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine), when he was with the British Army of Intervention during the Civil War. Uvarov sent Kennedy to the Sudan for the last few months of his Ph.D. to work on the behaviour of non-swarming locusts, in an area where they were endemic but sometimes switched to the potentially devastating, swarming type. His Ph.D. examiners, Buxton and C.B.Williams, F.R.S., were impressed with his science, but less impressed with his English, characterized by Buxton as 'sham German'. Indeed, though his prose was always immacu- late, the need Kennedy felt to cover all necessary caveats in his scientific statements, left his readers often punch-drunk by the end of a long paper. A problem he readily admitted, but about which, ever the scientific purist, he felt indisposed to compromise. Evidently the 'sham German' did not put off Buxton, who immediately offered Kennedy a one-year post at the London School, where he first met V.B. Wigglesworth, F.R.S., then laying the foundations of insect physiology, who was later to play a key role in Kennedy's career. At this point, Marston Bates, the distinguished American mosquito ecologist, visited the London School looking for a recruit to study mosquito behaviour at the Rockefeller Foundation's Malaria Research Laboratory in Tirana. Kennedy readily accepted his offer, but the appointment proved brief, since it was cut violently short by the Italian invasion of Albania on Good Friday 1939. The war years Back in London, he was unemployed once more, but Buxton came to his rescue with a rec- ommendation to C.M. Wenyon, F.R.S., and in late 1939 Kennedy was offered a post as Assistant Entomologist at the Wellcome Research Institute, Esher. However, this new position put Kennedy on the 'Reserved' list and this irritated him; he wanted to be part of the war effort. Therefore, once more with Buxton's help, he escaped Esher and returned to the London School to work on phenothiazine as a potential new insecticide for mosquitoes, a goal made urgent by the sinking of a cargo of Paris Green, the then conventional control for mosquito larvae. At this point locusts re-entered his life. An outbreak threatened Middle Eastern food crops, and replacement of these would have severely stretched the already shattered shipping 247</page><page sequence="5">Biographical Memoirs industry. Uvarov and Sir Guy Marshall, F.R.S., (Head of the Imperial Institute of Entomology) asked Buxton to release Kennedy so that he could return to his earlier work. The appointment was to the Colonial Office as Research Officer in the new Middle East Anti-Locust Unit; the job was to study the behaviour of locust swarms in the hope of dousing them with insecticide dust from the air as they slept on the ground at night. He worked all over the infested area: in Egypt, the Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Oman, India, and Kenya; and was provided with support in materiel that must surely be unique for a young sci- entist anywhere: a battalion of Indian troops, ten Russian crop-dusting aircraft, and a spe- cially created flight of modified RAF Avro Ansons. The disposal of these occupied him for two frustrating years, in which he never managed to get the insecticide supplies, aircraft, men, himself, and the right weather conditions all together at the same time and place as the locusts, until the last few weeks of 1944 in Kenya. And there it became clear that dusting from the air was ineffective unless the locusts were wet, and was dangerous to boot, because the pilots had to fly very low to ensure the dust hit the swarms on the ground. The technique was soon superseded by liquid sprays. During this period of restless frustration, Wigglesworth invited him to join his newly formed Agricultural Research Council (ARC) Unit of Insect Physiology. Kennedy was delighted and went to see him and Buxton just before D-Day 1944. His desire to be part of the war effort, however, led him to put off accepting the appointment until peace arrived. Wigglesworth was not enthusiastic, but let him go to a temporary post at the Chemical Defence Experimental Station at Porton Down, where they needed someone to work on adapting the military know-how of releasing poisons from the air to the control of mosqui- toes and other carriers of disease, as a prelude to the re-occupation of the Japanese-held terri- tories. In the event, it was some months before he could take up this post, while he recovered from the strains of overwork in the Middle East. The ARC Insect Physiology Unit, Cambridge Eventually, in January 1946, he left Porton Down and joined Wigglesworth, now in Cambridge as Head of the Sub-Department of Entomology. Like other senior scientists Kennedy had as colleagues, Wigglesworth did not approve of his politics. A devout Christian, Wigglesworth found no conflict between science and religion - a view Kennedy found hard to follow. On the other hand, Wigglesworth's approach to animal behaviour was very much the same mechanistic one as Kennedy's, and they remained in close agreement on this throughout their 20-year association till Wigglesworth's retirement in 1967. It was while working for Wigglesworth that Kennedy was elected to the Royal Society (1965). His remit at Cambridge was to study the behaviour of aphids. The underlying motivation was that aphids are the principal insect pests of temperate crops. For Kennedy, although this satisfied his puritan scruples, the real interest lay in the fascination with how aphids inte- grated their migration from host to host with their development - echoes of his Ph.D. work on locusts. The subject, in various guises, occupied him for the rest of his life. One activity he pursued outside Cambridge during this period was a start at modernizing the Royal Entomological Society, where he set in train a revolution in its publications. Although this did not fully flower for several years, thanks to the learned hysteresis natural in such institutions, it was the beginning of a revolution none the less. He initiated the Society's biennial Symposia, many of which proved to be entomological landmarks. He also 248</page><page sequence="6">John Stodart Kennedy took the first step towards bringing the Society's primary research journals out of their post- Victorian obscurity, simply by changing their titles from the Proceedings of... to the Journal of Entomology, which in due course led to a radical modernization of their editing - and finally to the Society actually earning real money from them. Imperial College at Silwood Park It was the policy of the Research Councils after the war to set up research 'Units' under the leadership of single, outstanding scientists. The unfortunate corollary for their staff was that on the leader's retirement, the Unit lost its raison d'etre. So it was that Wigglesworth's Unit of Insect Physiology disappeared on his retirement. Unlike the present cost-driven, short-term basis of research, however, in the 1960s the ARC took its staff commitments seriously; there was no question of Wigglesworth's half dozen scientists being made redundant. Nevertheless, for their research, even if not for their financial situation, it was a major distraction. It so happened that two other international entomological developments were taking place at this time. The headship of the other major University centre for entomological research, The Department of Zoology &amp; Applied Entomology at Imperial College, London, was changing hands; and at the newly formed Research School of Biological Sciences, at the Australian National University, Canberra, the Director, D.G. Catcheside, F.R.S., was seeking to fill Professorships in Animal Behaviour and Population Biology. Kennedy's former Ph.D. supervisor, D.L. Gunn was in a position of considerable influ- ence at the ARC in London, and ascertained that T.R.E. Southwood (later Sir Richard, F.R.S.), who was likely to succeed to the Headship at Imperial College, would welcome having Kennedy in the department, and also A.D. Lees (later F.R.S.) Kennedy's close col- league in Wigglesworth's Unit. Southwood relates that he had been greatly helped by Kennedy when developing his own ideas on insect migration a decade earlier (see Insect Migration), and felt this diaspora of entomological talent presented a great opportunity. As Kennedy was a personal friend, he felt confidence in disregarding the advice he was given that Kennedy's political views might make him a disruptive influence - a confidence he was to find fully justified over the ensuing years of collaboration. Simultaneously with these developments at Imperial College, the authorities in Canberra offered Kennedy and Southwood the Professorships at the Research School, and promised a senior position for Lees. They all agreed on the advantage of being in the same department, and in spring 1967 Southwood flew to Canberra to reconnoitre and report back. At a meeting over breakfast at the Kennedys' house in Cambridge, they decided: Southwood would accept the Headship at Imperial, and Kennedy and Lees would join him there, although Lees faced the upheaval with less enthusiasm than Kennedy. In fact, Kennedy had to decline an offer from the new Head of Zoology at Cambridge, Torkel Weis-Fogh, F.R.S., who wanted him to build a bridge between the ethologists under R.A. Hinde, F.R.S., at the Sub-Department of Animal Behaviour and the physiologists in the main department. Southwood's hospitality beckoned more warmly, however. Kennedy, already a D.C.S.O. in the ARC, had the title of Professor of Animal Behaviour conferred on him by London University when he moved to Imperial. Lees's initial position was to be a Readership, but his election to the Royal Society in 1968, followed by his promo- tion to D.C.S.O., resulted in his elevation to a Professorship of Insect Physiology, before he actually moved his laboratory. 249</page><page sequence="7">Biographical Memoirs One might have expected that the transplantation from the hotbed of physiology and behaviour that was Cambridge, to the apparent isolation of a 'field station' at Ascot would have rather stunted Kennedy's research. Far from it. Silwood gave him his first opportunity to start a research group of his own, his first real experience of directing others' research. By the time he retired, ten years later, his group consisted of five post-doctoral scientists, and as many support staff. Southwood had made available a large empty building that had been built years before as a pilot 'silo' for studying the control of insect pests of stored grain. This was ideal for Kennedy's purposes: single storey but 20 feet high internally. He used this space to form a unique, highly adaptable laboratory, designed so that a number of behavioural experiments could be carried out in it simultaneously. Its key features, were frequent plumbed-in supply points for power and conditioned air, ample space to build several large experimental rigs, and an extremely well-equipped, integral workshop. This well-planned set-up was to prove crucial in many of the innovations Kennedy made into insect behaviour over his time at Imperial - notably in the development of novel wind-tunnels. At Silwood, Kennedy and Lees jointly headed the ARC Insect Physiology Group, as it was called. The title, principally Kennedy's creation, is significant. It flagged up his philos- ophy of animal behaviour as physiology, rather than a separate discipline on its own, which is how ethologists, and science at large, are still apt to think of it. This philosophy also guided his advice to me in 1975, to call the new journal I was starting for the Royal Entomological Society Physiological Entomology, even though we expected it would con- centrate on behavioural research in insects. It has to be said that the message has not pene- trated far; a few years later the Journal of Insect Behaviour was floated by Pergamon. Five years into this new life, and having redoubled his enquiries into aphid behaviour, chance led Kennedy suddenly to switch his interest to moths. In 1972, H.H. Shorey in the United States published a paper in Science in which it was alleged that moths could orient towards a source of odour in still air by 'feeling' the edge of the odour plume. This made absolutely no sense to Kennedy, who had done experiments on flying mosquitoes 30 years earlier, and shown that they could not orient without visual cues from the ground pattern below. With characteristic thoroughness, he had a large new wind-tunnel built in his 'Behaviour Lab' by his highly skilled technicians A.A.G. Thomas and, later, J.G. Ions. This was used continuously for the next ten years to analyse insect flight - though first, to demolish Shorey. Aphid work continued but only as second fiddle. Administration and Teaching He always considered himself to be a 'soft' boss, and was indeed always concerned for others' personal problems, but he was undoubtedly a demanding director of research, expecting the same rigorous analysis of one's ideas as he used on his own. On one's written inadequacies he was merciless; precision in the written word was his hallmark, and he expected us all to be as perfect. This was a hard act to follow, and a few weaker souls gave up. The rest of us benefited enormously from being made to dissect our scientific method and analytical logic. We benefited also from the many distinguished scientists who came to visit him, whether just to discuss their research, or for longer periods to work with him. We ran a lunchtime seminar series whose programme sometimes looked like a Who's Who of the world's behavioural scientists. 250</page><page sequence="8">John Stodart Kennedy He was an excellent conversationalist and tutor. One arrived home late for supper on the days he strolled into one's lab at six in the evening to open a wide-ranging debate on some paper he had just read, or on the manuscript you had given him, or just on the current political iniquities. By contrast, he was never completely comfortable with the formal teaching Imperial College asked of him. His lectures were brilliant, but like his writing, too closely constructed for all but the most talented students to keep up with. His need for precision never quite let him relax into the more colloquial techniques used by better teachers - although lesser scientists - to deliver a more digestible product, even if it contained less meat. Kennedy's strength as a leader was the boost he gave to one's half-formed ideas. If he felt they were basically sound, he loyally supported all one's attempts to test them, inserting invaluable insights as one went along. He expected similar loyalty in return, but in the post- doctoral world of 'soft money', it was not always easy to reciprocate. Some of us failed the test. Thus I was taxed with 'selling him short' when I accepted a Lectureship at Imperial rather than remain his Research Fellow. But then, in almost the same breath, he began to muse on whether his own self-imposed goal of research above all else might not itself be selfish. This was an intellectual snare that he set for himself, and which clearly exercised him. It was during his period in the Civil Service at Porton Down that he found - to his horror - that he was beginning to enjoy the administration of research as much as the doing of it. And he made the decision there and then not to go down the road which led to that and to pedagogy; a route he described as giving people the satisfaction of power at the expense of their research. Twenty-five years later, Imperial College had deflected this aim somewhat: running his group at Silwood and his undergraduate course on animal behaviour became a substantial distraction. The other thing that niggled at the back of his mind was a sense of partial inferiority for doing 'applied' research; though in truth not much of what he did would be recognized as 'applied' by most entomologists. This was coupled with a more justified feeling that his pol- itics had handicapped his scientific recognition. Communist Party membership may indeed have delayed his invitation to become a member of a Cambridge College until the year he left, and then only to a 'new' college. Or, that may just have been Cambridge. More surely, his earlier Marxism did delay his election to the Royal Society. N. Tinbergen, F.R.S., wrote to him on his ultimate election saying as much, having evidently felt that Marxism and true science were so incompatible that he could not support his earlier candidature. This was a strange irony for Kennedy - who treasured this letter - because he had been attracted to Marxism in part precisely because he felt its materialism to be scientific. Retirement and Oxford At 65 he had to retire from the ARC. Happily, London University then made him an Emeritus Professor, and Imperial awarded him a Senior Research Fellowship, so he could continue to work on at Silwood. Now in close collaboration with C.T. David, he continued to raise the sophistication of their work on moth flight, by ever improving the wind-tunnel's technical range, but six years on he began to contemplate where to end his days. The senior executive, commuter ghetto that was Ascot did not appeal to either him or Claudette, and T.R.E. Southwood's offer in 1983 of a Research Associateship in Zoology at Oxford (where he was now Head of Department), was perfectly timed. As soon as he arrived 251</page><page sequence="9">Biographical Memoirs Kennedy returned to his work on aphids, but perhaps a more significant feature of his science here, was the presence of colleagues concerned with vertebrate behaviour. This group, among them J.R. Krebs, F.R.S., and members of the Animal Behaviour Research Group founded by N. Tinbergen, provided Kennedy with opportunities to test his ideas in an atmos- phere of more ethological argument, such as he had been little exposed to since leaving Cambridge and his association with R.A. Hinde and the Sub-department of Animal Behaviour at Madingley. In 1989 he finally ceased experimentation, and concentrated instead on writing the book he had planned for years. Curiously, although he was deeply immersed in scientific writing throughout his working life and, as we have seen, updated the Royal Entomological Society's publications, he only ever edited one small symposium, and never until this point embarked upon a book of his own, in spite of countless invitations to do so. Happily, the book was published virtually on his 80th birthday, and he lived to see it appreciated by his peers. He worked quite literally until his dying day. It was in the Zoology Department at Oxford that he simply faded out, just after a conversation on insect behaviour with a colleague, to die peacefully in hospital that night. He would not have wished it otherwise; although he listed his recreation in Who's Who as interior design, research was his only real recreation. RESEARCH AND PUBLICATIONS One of Kennedy's great contributions to the study of insect behaviour was the introduc- tion of controlled experimentation rather than mere observation. Throughout his career, he repeatedly developed new apparatus to provide reliably repeatable experimental stimuli. His very first paper (1)* concerned the devising of a simple choice chamber to test the reactions of small animals to different ambient humidities. Sixty years later, this apparatus is probably still the single most widely used basis for behavioural experimentation, whether in school biology classes, undergraduate labs, or true behavioural research. We will see as we go along the more important of his other equipment innovations set in the context of each phase of his research. Insecticides He was one of the earliest to recognize that the new insecticides were not the infallible panacea they had been touted as; they could not be used to kill insects without care or plan- ning. When DDT was first introduced during the war, it was assumed that it would kill any insect that came into contact with it. He showed this was not so, being the first to identify its excito-repellent action (12), and the fact that this often made mosquitoes leave treated sur- faces before they acquired a lethal dose. They might be knocked down by its toxic effects, and even show obvious signs of poisoning, but that was not necessarily a death sentence. The significance of this for the control of domestic mosquitoes was particularly important, since he also showed that the repellent action was coupled with a positive response to light, so that the excited individuals might well fly out of the treated house to escape completely. * Numbers in this form refer to entries in the bibliography on the accompanying microfiche. 252</page><page sequence="10">John Stodart Kennedy Locust swarming It had been known since biblical times that swarms of locusts appeared unpredictably 'from nowhere' to devastate crops, and then disappeared again equally mysteriously, only to reappear again without warning years later. By the 1930s it was known that these 'gregar- ious' swarms were simply a different form of a species that normally spent its time harm- lessly, as solitary grasshoppers, and that the change of behaviour to swarming could be induced experimentally by crowding the solitary forms in a cage. What was not known was how this occurred in nature, where such confinement was difficult to envisage. In 1937, Kennedy arrived at a locust outbreak in the Sudan, and immediately set to work on the problem. He found that the answer lay in the grasshoppers' tendency to bask in the sun. The solitary form's ideal habitat was a weedy crop with scattered patches of bare soil. The vegeta- tion provided ample food, shelter and resting sites so that the young locust 'hoppers' remained largely out of contact with each other, especially when there were few of them present. But their habit of sun-bathing to warm up tended to bring them together in the bare, sunlit patches every morning. If the solitary hoppers were few, they still remained largely out of touch, but as their numbers grew, they encountered each other more and more in these warm spots. These frequent contacts with other hoppers 'gregarized' them, in just the same way as in crowded cages: they changed from the solitary into the gregarious form, and began marching in massed bands, until they became adult and swarmed off on the wing. Kennedy also found a marked difference in the walking behaviour of the two forms. Confronted with vegetation when they were in a clearing, the solitary grasshoppers walked towards the vegetation and climbed into it. The gregarious bands, by contrast, simply marched round such obstructions and onwards (9). This work led to the first of many letters to Nature (3), his first long scien- tific paper (5), and his Ph.D. Many years later he returned to the subject when he was thinking about the way insect development might be directed down different physiological-behavioural pathways; a sub- ject of great importance for the highly polymorphic aphids with which he was then occupied. He proposed (36, 51, 53) that locusts' dimorphism was an evolutionary development of the typical way insects develop through quite different immature and mature stages. He envis- aged the solitary grasshoppers as being physiologically juvenile relative to the more mature, gregarious form. He also described locusts as being 'dioecious': the solitaries living in one habitat, a rather specialized well-provisioned one, and the gregarious living in another, more precarious one, with their behaviour adapted to exploit temporary vegetation caused by unpredictable rain in an inhospitable land. Animal orientation Throughout his working life, Kennedy was fascinated by the integration of behaviour, and he found the simpler reflexes involved in animal orientation - how they manoeuvred through their environment in adaptive ways, towards food, away from light, to find mates, and so on - an ideal model to work with. This thought-seed was sown by his early Ph.D. work with D.L. Gunn in Birmingham, where they were examining the temperature and humidity reac- tions of locusts. Gunn was then thinking about this in the context of how the random manoeuvres of animals effectively displaced them relative to ambient conditions which con- tain no inherently directional information, such as temperature and humidity. These manoeuvres 253</page><page sequence="11">Biographical Memoirs were known at the time simply as kinesis, and were thought to relate only to the animals' speed of movment. What Kennedy and Gunn discovered was that animals in this situation changed not only their speed, but also their rate of turning, so that two different behavioural mechanisms were involved, for which they proposed the terms ortho-kinesis and klino-kinesis, respectively (4). This work is of historical interest on two counts, first because it led Gunn and G.S. Fraenkel, Kennedy's old M.Sc. supervisor at UCL, to write a book to sort out the tangled web of mis- nomers and misconceptions then current in animal orientation behaviour (The Orientation of Animals, 1940). And secondly, because the concept of klinokinesis has returned repeatedly to the behavioural literature over the last 60 years, to be re-examined, killed, and resurrected, again and again - most recently in 1992. A rather less resilient concept that Kennedy introduced was that of 'direct' and 'inverse' kineses, to indicate whether the response increased in direct or inverse proportion to stimulus strength (11). This evolved from his recognition that although temperature normally increases the rate of movement of small invertebrates, it decreased that rate in the case of locusts basking in the sun. The concept was never widely adopted, however, because it is often difficult to know precisely what the stimulus is. Is a hygro-kinesis a reaction to low humidity or to high saturation deficit, for example? It may also be that the concept was rather too subtle for most behaviourists to bother to understand. A more useful, and certainly more used concept was that of longitudinal klinotaxis (86). Fraenkel and Gunn had introduced the term klinotaxis in their book to cover those simplest of directed responses in which an animal moves directly towards (or away from) a stimulus source, but does so with receptors that are only crudely directionally sensitive (hence the suffix taxis rather than kinesis). Classically, an animal such as a maggot wig-wags away from a light source, using its crude cephalic photo-receptor to compare the 'unpleasant' light intensity alternately on the two sides of its body, i.e. laterally. What Kennedy suddenly real- ized, nearly 40 years later, was that there is a different, very common form of this response that had lain unrecognized. This was the kind of manoeuvre in which the animal compares the stimulus strength as it progresses along its track, and hence does so 'longitudinally' rather than 'laterally' in the classic mode. The most obvious version of this response is the complete reverse turn that animals often make on losing contact with a stimulus patch, particularly as they walk out of an area of odour, as in a dog tracking a rabbit. More subtly, the response is involved whenever an animal makes a turn of more or less fixed size as a result of a change in stimulus intensity over time. The size and direction of the turn is fixed by central nervous control (it is 'idio- thetic'), rather than by any directionality in the stimulus itself (which would be 'allothetic'). Kennedy pointed out (98) that this kind of self-steered, longitudinal klinotaxis was a crucial component of the zig-zagging flight that insects employ when they navigate up plumes of attractant odour, the topic that occupied his last decade at Silwood Park (see below). The reader will have detected a muddying of the waters: if the direction of the turns in longitudinal klinotaxis are not directed by the external stimulus direction, why are they not a kinesis rather than a taxis? Kennedy, too, noticed this confusion, but pointed out that the two types of turning response are simply the extremes of a continuum of turning strategies (100). Indeed, he was sufficiently worried by this to propose dropping the 'taxis' suffix altogether, and replacing the whole term with a new one, schema-kinesis (105). Time will show whether this is to become widely adopted. 254</page><page sequence="12">John Stodart Kennedy Orientation in flight Kennedy used Buxton's offer of the Avebury Studentship in 1938 for a year's intense exploration of mosquito flight. Insects' tendency to fly upwind had been known since Wheeler identified it as 'anemo-tropism' in 1899, but no-one had directly analysed how this form of orientation occurred. Kennedy set out with characteristic thoroughness to design and exploit two novel and crucial pieces of equipment. The first was a kind of flight 'balance' in which a flying mosquito tethered on a single silk thread acted as its own flight direction indi- cator, as if it were the needle of a compass. The second was a small, slow-speed wind-tunnel with a moving floor pattern. This latter was particularly prescient. It anticipated by 30 years the wind-tunnel work that developed in the 1970s rush to study moth orientation when synthetic pheromones (sex odours) became available for pest control. It was a brilliant experiment, in which Kennedy tested the hypothesis (originally due to Fraenkel but never tested by him) that a flying animal - being borne in and on the wind - could not possibly orient to the wind without doing so visually. The critical innovation was his introduction of a pattern of moving stripes projected opti- cally onto the walls and floor of the wind-tunnel in which the mosquitoes were flying in response to human odour. When the air moved and the stripes were still, the mosquitoes made gentle headway upwind. But, equally, when the air was still and the stripes were moved, the mosquitoes also overtook the stripes. No such behaviour occurred when the tunnel was in darkness. Clearly, flight orientation in wind was not a mechanical response to air movement, but was, indeed, a visual one alone. This seminal conclusion was referred to in Fraenkel and Gunn's book in 1940, but lay curiously unremarked thereafter, until the explosion of moth pheromone work in the 1970s, since when it has come to be seen, rightly, as a landmark paper. Strangely, even Kennedy himself seems not to have referred to it again until 1978, although he had returned whole- heartedly to the subject in 1973, when he built his large wind-tunnel at Silwood in order to refute Shorey's claims of moths making upwind progress by responding to odour gradients (75; see Career). His return to flight orientation following this argument with Shorey turned out to be par- ticularly productive. In the main, this was because his re-creation of a wind-tunnel with a moving floor pattern fully controllable for speed and direction was such a powerful tool for the analysis of flight control that it generated what has almost become a sub-discipline in animal behaviour. Since he left Imperial College, it has sadly been the Americans who have most eagerly recognized the value of this technique. And it is they, rather than any British or European scientists, who have taken over Kennedy's behavioural-analytical torch, often bril- liantly developing his ideas. However, in the 1970s and 1980s, Kennedy and his colleagues led the new analysis of flight behaviour and, following the original Shorey disproof (75), a long series of much- quoted papers emerged from the work Kennedy did with D. Marsh, A.R. Ludlow, C.J. Sanders, C.T. David and others (87, 90-93, 95-98, 105, 108). This is surely the work for which he will be best remembered. The key findings revolve around the demonstration of the paramount importance of the direction and speed of apparent ground pattern movement for insects navigating up wind-borne odour 'plumes' - optomotor-guided anemotaxis, as it became called (slightly inappropriately). 255</page><page sequence="13">Biographical Memoirs Built into this behavioural system there turned out to be a number of 'rules'. One was that flying insects tend to have a 'preferred' groundspeed: if the speed of the wind (or of the moving floor) changes, the insect adjusts its airspeed accordingly (87). From the point of view of visual control this makes obvious (probably inevitable) sense. A second aspect, that linked back to Kennedy's analysis of longitudinal klinotaxis (or schema-kinesis, as we should now say), was that moths tend to zig-zag up odour plumes by a programme of self-steered, alternating left and right turns interspersed with straightish legs of approximately fixed duration. A crucial input turned out to be the moth's 'drift angle': the divergence between the direction the insect is pointing (its course) and the direction it actu- ally travels over the ground (its track). For a given odour concentration, this was kept roughly constant in the face of changing wind speed, by the insect adjusting its course angle and airspeed appropriately - again, visual control of upwind flight. And when the odour concentration changed, the angle of these counter-turns was adjusted. For example, if the moth lost contact with the odour plume, it increased its turns from about 90? to about 180?, and lengthened the duration of each straight leg of the zig-zag, thereby 'casting' across the wind (92). This resulted in the moth scanning a wider area, and so increasing its chances of re-locating the odour plume. Insect migration One's doctoral project, being the childhood of one's research life, is often deeply forma- tive. Thus it is no surprise that Kennedy should have maintained a life-long interest in insect migration after his Ph.D. on locusts. He recognized early on that there were similarities between the superficially different phenomena of the massive, international migrations of locusts, and the local plant to plant displacements of aphids. He first wrote about this in 1945 (9), but returned to it repeatedly (24, 49, 58, 66, 71, 77, 88, 104). The apparently huge differences of scale and type in the numerous kinds of insect dis- placement had caused sufficient confusion among biologists by the mid-1950s that a search for unifying principles appeared to have been virtually abandoned. It had become simpler to view these movements on a case-by-case basis, to assume passive displacement by wind as the main driving force, and to reduce argument to the purely ecological level. Kennedy felt otherwise, believing that insect migration could be defined behaviourally. At the same time his friend from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine days, C.G. Johnson, was studying aphid migration on a population scale at Rothamsted Experimental Station and was developing generalizations on the the relationship of migration to reproduction. T.R.E. Southwood, who had done his Ph.D. with Johnson, was interested in the evolutionary aspect and the role of habitat. He relates how Kennedy would visit Rothamsted and they, and others involved, would all gather to share ideas. As a young post-doctoral worker, Southwood was greatly impressed at the equality of sta- tion that Kennedy and Johnson gave to himself and the others: criticism was fierce on all sides but rank and experience were never used in argument. There was no feeling of compe- tition, no unseemly rush to publish, and certainly no anxiety that one's ideas might be 'cribbed' - Kennedy's word at the time. These were happy, productive days, and the discus- sions lead in succession to a letter to Nature by Johnson, papers at the 1960 International Congress of Entomology by all three of them, a major article in Nature by Kennedy (49), a long review in Biological Reviews by Southwood, and finally to a book by Johnson. 256</page><page sequence="14">John Stodart Kennedy Kennedy's article in Nature laid the foundations for a new thinking about the subject. He argued that although the manner in which insects travel does indeed vary widely, there are nevertheless some common underlying principles which distinguish migration behaviourally and physiologically from mere random dispersal. The first is that migration is characterized by persistent, straightened out locomotion (the 'klinokinetic' component), or else by some special behaviour that maintains the insect's semi-passive transport by wind or water; both types of behaviour ensuring long-distance displacement. Second, this goes hand-in-hand with a temporary inhibition of what C.B. Williams had called 'vegetative' responses to stimuli that would normally evoke settling, for feeding or egg laying - for example the plant- avoiding habits of marching locust bands (see Locust Swarming). And third, migration is more or less intimately coupled with the life cycle, so that it typically occurs pre-reproduc- tively, and hence lands the insect in its new habitat ready to exploit it. This article laid the foundation for all subsequent thinking about insect migration. On the way through his analysis, Kennedy laid waste those areas of ecology where he found the incumbents arguing teleologically about migration by invoking 'search strategies' and the like. As we shall see, this was not his first nor his last polemic against such anthropomorphism. The article's point of deepest insight was its second principle: the role of inhibition in reg- ulating behaviour. Kennedy's great hero, C.S. Sherrington, F.R.S., had long ago pointed out the importance of reciprocal inhibition in the spinal reflexes of dogs, but this had become largely lost in the 1930s mechanistic obsession with push-button, stimulus-response reflexes - eschewed by Kennedy. He repeatedly drew attention to the fundamental importance of inhibition, rather than stimulation, in behaviour, noting that the animal was invariably not doing far more things than it was overtly doing. An interesting corollary was his several demonstrations of the role of Sherrington's antagonistic induction as a form of post- inhibitory rebound in behaviour: the after-effect of inhibiting one reflex (e.g. flight) by its antagonist (landing) was to enhance the former as soon as the inhibition ceased (41, 61, 76, 85, 109). Aphids and plants Kennedy's 22 years at Cambridge, his first five years at Imperial, and his last three or four at Oxford were devoted to the behaviour of aphids. This work spanned many aspects of the relationships between aphids and their plant hosts. He focused his studies on a single clone of one species, the bean aphid, Aphis fabae, thereby removing at least genetical variance in the inherently variable world of an animal's behaviour. Much of this work concerned host selection. His first step was to get away from the cur- rent concentration on the taxonomic specificity of aphid and host, to show that the physiolog- ical condition of a plant's leaves was often more important than its species. He found that young and senescing leaves were the most attractive, because their high amino-acid content provided the necessary nitrogen not otherwise readily available in plant sap (20, 21). The relationship between host taxonomy and physiology, thus revealed, then provided the basis for the 'dual discrimination' theory he proposed to explain how aphids exploit different plants at different seasons, as most do (22, 27). This remains still a fundamental concept in the application of pest management strategies based on host plant resistance. An ingenious trick he developed for this work, with T.E. Mittler, was to cut a feeding aphid's mouthparts close to its head, leaving its stylets still piercing the plant's phloem cells 257</page><page sequence="15">Biographical Memoirs (30). As the sap still issued from the cut stylets, this made obvious what had previously been only suspected, that aphids exploit their host's turgor pressure when feeding. It also provided an explanation for why aphids avoid wilting tissue (42, 44). And, in a wider context, it pro- vided plant physiologists with an exquisitely precise method for sampling uncontaminated phloem sap. Host selection by aphids fascinated Kennedy because of its implications for the way insects might integrate their various behaviours, in this case, take-off, ascent, flight, migra- tion, descent, landing, probing, and reproduction. From earlier evidence, he believed (wrongly, as it turned out many years later) that selection did not involve host odour. The obvious alternative method of host selection was visual, to test which he reasoned that it should be possible to sample aphids alighting on host and non-host plants side by side, and then demonstrate which had been selected when the aphids were still in flight. The problem was that very few aphids ever land on any plant over a humanly reasonable time span. As a result, it took 11 long years of rushing out to the field whenever aphids were especially numerous, to find that no such in-flight selection apparently occurred (16, 46, 47). He concluded that landing on different plants was random: the aphids merely descended out of the air when their migratory flight had lasted long enough to raise the thresholds for their skywards, blue responses, and lower the thresholds for their plantwards, green responses (50). Selection, he proposed, occurred only when the aphids had landed and tasted the plant (81). This finding caused a stir at the time, even though it later proved to be only partly right: both visual and olfactory host-specific responses from a distance are also involved, as he later conceded (105). He was also the first to demonstrate that aphids which exploit annual plants are attracted to green shapes silhouetted against bare earth, rather than to solid stands of green, whereas aphids which feed on trees or grass are not attracted by such plant-soil contrasts. This behav- iour underlies the speed with which aphids find young crop plants, and has been exploited in low-cost pest control by allowing weeds to grow between the rows of crops. Aphids owe their real reputation as pests not to the irritation they cause gardeners, but because of the plant viruses they transmit to major crops. Kennedy looked at this in the con- text of aphids' selection of feeding sites, and found a surprisingly cosy relationship between aphid and virus. The changes induced by the virus in the plant's metabolism - a kind of pre- mature senescence - made the sap more nutritious for the aphid, which, therefore, did much better on infected hosts (26). This led him to propose that aphid and virus were symbionts (47, 48), an interestingly prescient suggestion, since it is now emerging that insect vectors of animal disease may develop similar, semi-symbiotic relationships with their apparent pathogens. The final phase of Kennedy's research on aphids brought these differing threads together. He started to look at the integration of aphids' take-off, flight and landing in relation to their orientation to potential hosts. Once again the key was the equipment he devised. This time it was a vertical wind-tunnel, and again entirely novel. In essence it used an overhead light (the 'sky') to attract flying aphids upwards against gravity, but kept them in effectively level flight by blowing an adjustable wind downwards, or upwards, as necessary. The operator held the aphid circling under the overhead light at a constant height by manually adjusting an 'up' or 'down' valve, the aphid's rate of climb being registered in terms of the strength of the up or down draught (54, 76). This provided some of the first clear evidence of anatagonistic induction in whole animal 258</page><page sequence="16">John Stodart Kennedy behaviour (see Insect Migration). The longer the aphid had been flying, the more readily it landed when a leaf was presented to it. Conversely, the stronger its response to the leaf, the stronger (and longer) its flight when it took off again (55, 58). These two effects were recip- rocal: flight enhanced landing, and landing enhanced flight, making it highly unlikely that the effects could be due to mere fatigue. Futhermore, flight from host leaves (which were responded to most strongly) was much stronger than from non-host leaves. Although other such examples existed in the literature, this was the first explicit quantification of behav- ioural post-inhibitory rebound (61). Kennedy's very last experimental paper, from Oxford, was to concern a new version of this same phenomenon: aphids increased their tendency to fly after being inhibited from taking off by wind, with the strength of the behavioural rebound being proportional to the strength of the inhibiting wind (109). Campaign against anthropomorphism There is a bright thread that is woven throughout the fabric of Kennedy's research. This is an unremitting campaign, a mission almost, against the insidious intrusion of teleological anthropomorphism into behavioural and psychological writings. His only book, his swan- song, was devoted to this (110), but he first wrote on it 40 years earlier (32). That philippic against the anthropomorphist analysis of the early ethologists was not well-received at the time. Indeed, he found some difficulty in publishing it, but in due course it came to be recog- nized by many (though not all) as a valuable warning. What incensed Kennedy was the creation of behavioural constructs such as 'motivation', 'drive', 'displacement activity', and so on, which he saw as being inherently teleological: 'Why is that animal feeding?' 'Because it is motivated to feed.' 'How do you know it has that motivation?' 'Because it is eating'. This kind of circularity was anathema to Kennedy, who was a purist through and through when it came to logical analysis. It did not make him universally popular with those who studied vertebrate behaviour, because they believed they were using these terms merely as convenient shorthand for identifying behavioural causes. That, Kennedy felt, was the beginning of the slippery slope that led inexorably down- wards to unconscious anthropomorphism, and he argued against it repeatedly (37, 59, 66, 72, 101, 107), and finally at length in his book. This, though a mere 190 pages, is an immensely erudite document, based on an extraordinarily wide reading of the literature, spanning behav- iour, neurobiology, psychology, and ecology over the entire twentieth century.
