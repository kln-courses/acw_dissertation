(SP-506) Endurance testing of heavy duty vehicles. Ray W. Murphy, Freightliner Corp. Endurance tests are conducted on heavy duty vehicles to assure maintenance of structural integrity and acceptable levels of performance over the projected service life in the vocation for which the vehicles are intended. This paper reviews current practice in endurance testing as applied to the structural components of heavy duty vehicles, components, and systems. A brief historical perspective is given, describing how endurance testing evolved from an art, based mostly on experience and engineering judgment, to a rather sophisticated technol- ogy. A brief treatise is given on fundamentals of fatigue life prediction, followed by a discussion of the technology and methodology involved in proving ground testing, use of road simulators and cab shakers, and laboratory based tests of systems and components. 820002. Modification of CFR test engine unit to determine octane numbers of pure alcohols and gasoline- alcohol blends. I. Hunwartzen, Fachausschuss für Mineralöl- und Brennstoffnormung • FAM. The CFR test engine unit was modified by the use of a variable fuel needle jet, instead of the carburetor main jet of standard size (ASTM research and motor method), as well as by an additional heating system for the air/fuel mixture pre-heating device (ASTM motor method). This enables octane ratings of pure alcohols and gasoline- alcohol blends without changing engine operating con- ditions as specified by ASTM. The applicability of the newly developed supplementary devices was verified and found appropriate by the members of a FAM Task Group, organized within the German Institute for Stan- dardization (DIN). 820003. The Phillips small sample research octane number method. W. V. Childs and E. H. Vickery, Phillips Petroleum Co., Research and Development, Bartlesville, OK. The Phillips Small Sample Octane Number Method (Research) was derived from the ASTM method by replacing the ASTM fuel metering system with a low dead volume induction system injection pump and by replacing the analog signal processing equipment. The pump, signal processing, and fuel sampling are under computer control. Important features include direct comparison of each test fuel with primary reference fuels, signal averaging to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, and frequency domain filtering. With a microprocessor-based system nine to ten routine determinations can be done each hour using less than 15 ml of test fuel. A more powerful computer should permit the rating of 25 to 30 test fuels each hour. Except for the time and fuel requirements the results from this method are comparable to those obtained with the ASTM method. SAE Trans ., Vol. 91 820007 820004. Electronic control of ignition timing. M. Welch, J. A. Cooke, F. Kelly, and W. G. Lloyd, Shell Research Limited. An electronic system for the control of engine ignition timing has been developed for use in studies of the road anti-knock performance of gasolines. It does not require a crankshaft encoder, and operates using existing signals from the distributor. Static timing is controlled without alteration to the centrifugal or vacuum timing mecha- nisms. An additional feature identifies the cylinder(s) most prone to knock. 820005. Liquid crystal displays with integrated electronics for dashboard instrumentation. H. Baeger, VDO Adolf Schindling AG (Schwalbach, Germany). Today, millions of liquid crystal displays are used in wrist watches, clocks, pocket calculators, and measuring in- struments. For automotive application, many problems had to be solved. The present paper gives a survey of the most important results of VDO development work aiming at a display system which will be fully suited for automotive application. 820006. LCD-instrumentation in automobiles. F. Heintz and P. M. Knoll, Robert Bosch GmbH (Stutt- gart, F. R. of Germany). The present paper demonstrates the feasibility of liquid crystal displays for automotive applications. It covers points of special interest in LCD charac- teristics such as contrast behaviour in comparison to active electronic display technologies and matching of LCD's with mechanical instrumentation. Technological aspects are discussed e.g. contrast optimization with respect to the viewing area or switching behaviour. It also describes technical methods used to solve special auto- motive problems such as illumination, anti-reflection, driving and connecting techniques. Examples of applications are given for single stand alone instruments and complete dashboards as well. 820007. Liquid crystal automotive displays, present pos- sibilities - future technology trends. Hans U. Beyeler, Videlec Ltd. (Lenzburg, Switzerland). Twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal display technology has now attained a level of maturity which matches the uncompromising requirements for its implementation in automobiles. Present day performance of TN-LCD's is analysed in terms of basic intrinsic properties, cell technology performance and polarizer quality. Future developments aim at higher infoi mation densities and increased system reliability, they include the incorporation of integrated driver circuits on the glass substrate of the display. Other LC display technologies as e.g. dichroic displays shall become available for dashboards; they greatly profit from the cell technology experience gained through TN-LCDs, yet their performance has still to be improved through progress in LC and dye material research. 21</page><page sequence="3">820008 820008. Liquid crystal displays with FIP illuminator. Fumihiro Ogawa, Norio Sato, and Takao Mimit- suka, Nippon Electric Co., Ltd. (Kanagawa, Japan). The legibility and usefulness of liquid crystal displays (LCD's) in automotive applications depends entirely on the type and control of the illumination technique chosen. The use of a fluorescent indicator panel (FIP) as an illumination source from the backside of an LCD is proposed. The LCD surface brightness levels and legibility over a wide ambient lighting range are discussed. Three opera- tional modes (transmissive, reflective, and transflective) of the FIP-LCD system are considered. 820009. LCD instrument panel for automobiles. Hisatsugu Itoh, Koji Katayama, and Kosaku Uota, Himeji Works, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (Himeji, Japan).; and Naotake Kumagai and Ikuo Saga, Passenger Car Engineering Center, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (Okazaki, Japan). Mitsubishi Electric and Mitsubishi Motors have devel- oped an LCD instrument panel and will introduce to their 1982 model car. A digital speedometer, a tachometer, a fuel gauge, and a temperature gauge are integrated on a single LCD. The cluster has a backlight that illuminates the LCD whenever the system is active. The response of the LCD is fast enough to display the vehicle speed in digital form. An extensive reliability test showed that this cluster is as reliable as its VFT counterparts. 820010. The "itron" 256 X 256 dot matrix graphic/image vacuum fluorescent display. Hideo Shimizu and Mitsuru Masuda, Ise Electronics Corp. (Ise, Mie, Japan). A graphic and image VFD having high dense 256 by 256 dot matrix has been developed. The manufacture of versatile display patterns by thick film printing and producing of glass substrate by thin film technique become possible easily to constitute high dense anode deposit and high quality. In consequence of new technology establishment, especially the grid construction and improvement of grid formation, the high dense image display was achieved with the exact addressing of each dot. This paper discribes about itself which has the possibility of displaying graphic and image for the automotive application. 820011. Further study on LCD legibility improvement for automobiles. I. Terada, K. Akeyoshi, and F. Kadoo, Research &amp; Development Div., Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. (Yokohama/ Japan). Electronic instrument panels have now begun to find their way into some cars. And, recently, liquid crystal display (LCD) is about to be adopted in automobiles as a speedometer, a tachometer and other gauges. This paper describes considerations of LCD on the viewing angle, the response time, the contrast and so on. This is a further study of the previous report. 820012. A new construction approach to liquid crystal display instrument for automobiles. T. Minowa and K. Akeyoshi, Electronic Devices Devel- opment Group Research &amp; Development Div., ASAHI Glass Co. Ltd., Hazawa-Cho, Kana- gawa- Ku, Yokohama, Japan.; and H. Araki, ASAHI Glass Co., Ltd. (New York, USA). The application of Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) to automobiles has grown exponentially because of their flat-screen display construction. However, problems re- lating to LCD system construction including the connec- tion technology make it difficult to apply LCDs to large-area automobile instruments. The best-suited con- nection technique between LCD panels and drive circuit components is the soldering method used to effect adhesion. This paper describes a new construction approach for LCD devices which uses a new connection method and the chip on flexible printed circuit board (Flexible PCB) technique. 820013. The visual recognition of vacuum fluorescent displays under sunlight conditions. Toshihiro Yamaguchi, Takao Kishino, and Joe M. Dorris, Futaba Corp. The visual recognition of self-luminous displays in the automobile instrument panel under direct sunlight con- ditions is a major design criteria. The user-display interface requires the designer to consider factors of visibility, legibility, reading fatigue and styling. All factors are important, but under direct sunlight conditions, visibility has to take the highest priority and is the most important design factor. The object of this paper is to delineate visibility parameters by analyzing the results of experiments designed to determine the minimum brightness levels and type of filtering required to obtain visual recognition of vacuum fluorescent displays under the sunlight condi- tions.

Light Emitting Diode (LED) display devices allow the display system designer maximum flexibility of display distribution within a display system. LED displays are available as discrete lamps, annunciators, and digits, as well as lamp and annunciator arrays and multidigit modules. Discrete display elements allow the display system designer to distribute displayed information exactly as he wishes without penalties of size or weight. Modular devices minimize assembly time of display systems by reducing the number of insertions required for groups of display elements. LED display elements of different colors allow easily designed multicolor display systems. Bicolor LED display elements, in addition to allowing the same freedom of distribution, provide the display system designer with greater information density than an equivalently sized single color display element. These capabilities are illustrated by use of display system 22</page><page sequence="4">design examples. Example designs emphasize the use of industry standard display devices as well as presenting examples of possible custom display devices for the automotive market. 820015. Development of as-rolled dual phase steel ob- tained by accelerated cooling to extra-low coiling temperature. Shigeki Hamamatsu and Seiichi Sugisawa, Kashima Steel Works, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd.; and Kazutoshi Kuni- shige, Masashi Takahashi, and Noriaki Nagao, Central Research Laboratories, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. As-rolled dual phase steels containing small amounts of alloy elements have been developed by accelerated cooling to extra low coiling temperature on hot runout table. This manufacturing process, called ICQ method, is characterized by three step cooling pattern together with the controls of finishing and coiling temperatures. It is economical because of using less alloy element than other methods. The dual phase steels manufactured by this method exhibit excellent formability and high bake hardenability with small variation in properties. They have been successful in application to most of the auto-parts, especially to wheel disc with large weight saving. 820018. Bake-hardenable Al-killed steel (RBH-35) for automobile body panels. Atsuki Okamoto, Yu- taka Hayashi, Masashi Takahashi, and Seiichi Sugisawa, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. In order to attain the gauge reduction of outer body panels without spoiling the dent-resistance and forma- bility, a bake-hardenable Al-killed steel sheet, named RBH-35, has been developed in the conventional box- annealing process. RBH-35 is an 0.01% carbon, low manganese and rephosphorized Al-killed steel sheet retaining solute carbon of about 10 ppm. The steel exhibits high r-value, bake-hardenability of 40 MPa, ultimate tensile strength of above 350 MPa and sub- stantially non-aging property. Results of stamping test of door outer panel showed that RBH-35 is the most suitable steel sheet for the thinning of outer body panels by about 10%. This paper reports the metallurgical features, mechanical properties and applications of the steel. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820019. 1983 Ford Ranger truck HSLA steel wheel. C. L. Bambenek, S. Mocarski, J. W. Mitchell, and M. K. Bidol, Ford Motor Co.; and J. A. Lumm, Kelsey-Hayes Co. The demand for improved fuel economy in both cars and trucks has emphasized the need for lighter weight components. The application of high strength steel to wheels, both rim and disc, represents a significant opportunity for the automotive industry. This paper discusses the Ranger HSLA wheel program that achieved a 9.7 lbs. per vehicle weight savings relative 820024 to a plain carbon steel wheel of the same design. It describes the Ranger wheel specifications, the material selection, the metallurgical considerations of applying HSLA to wheels, and HSLA arc and flash butt welding. The Ranger wheel design and the development of the manufacturing process is discussed, including design modifications to accommodate the lighter gage. The results demonstrate that wheels can be successfully manufactured from low sulfur 60XK HSLA steel in a conventional high volume process (stamped disc and rolled rim) to meet all wheel performance requirements and achieve a significant weight reduction.

The American Iron and Steel Institute's "Guide for Preliminary Design of Sheet Steel Automotive Structural Components" is briefly reviewed, and the theoretical basis for the recommended design procedure is presented. Failure load predictions determined using the Guide procedures are compared with test results. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820022. Copper bearing high strength cold rolled steel sheets with superior drawability. K. Kameno, S. Nomura, and I. Kokubo, Kobe Steel, Ltd. (Japan). Copper and phosphorus bearing high strength cold rolled steel sheets with superior drawability have been devel- oped. The copper and phosphorus contents of these steels are 0.6% and 0.08% respectively. The tensile strengths of the steels are 500-550 MPa and the r values are as high as 1.5-1.7. The excellent r values of these steels are obtained by the precipitation treatment of 650°C X 10 hrs before cold rolling. This high r value is considered to be caused by the copper precipitates occurred during this heat treatment. Both silicon and manganese strengthened copper bearing steels are investigated. High-silicon steels have better elongation than high-manganese steels. As to the r value, however, the latter are superior. In order to obtain excellent r value, high reduction in cold rolling and slow heating in annealing are required in addition to the precipitation treatment before cold rolling. The results of the trial production at Kobe Steel's Kakogawa Works showed good agreement with those of laboratory study. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820024. Design of lightweight vacuum power brake boosters. L. P. Rossigno and J. J. Horsting, Automotive Control Systems Group - North America, The Bendix Corp.; and J. J. Carré, D.B. A. Société Anonyme, Division Technique. Emphasis on size and weight reduction in the automotive industry has led The Bendix Corporation to the devel- opment of lighter, more efficient, vacuum power brake boosters. This paper discusses the objectives, the evolution of design, and various design concepts to reduce weight and increase efficiency. 23</page><page sequence="5">820024 SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820025.

A dual-mode height sensing brake proportioning valve. Gerald Sivulka and Gary Willi, Kelsey- Hayes Co., Romulus, MI. This paper describes the performance, design and oper- ation of a new selective brake proportioning valve developed by Kelsey-Hayes Co. It combines positive braking performance with high product reliability to achieve significant quality improvements in the brake systems of vehicles with large differences between empty and loaded weights. This valve can be used as a tool by the brake system engineer to approximate the ideal brake balance for all ranges of vehicle loading. Introduced on 1982 Chevrolet C30 and K30 series trucks, this new product offers basic advantages over variable split load sensing proportioning valves used in the past. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820027. Valeo Crown Brake. J. C. Mouza, Valeo. Valeo is currently developing a new type of brake for passenger cars and light trucks called Crown Brake. The Crown Brake is equivalent to a disc brake with a large diameter, and where the friction surfaces have been curved into a cylindrical shape. This original concept confers to the Crown Brake all the advantages of a conventional disc brake and intro- duces two new key advantages: • the useful brake radius is increased by 20 to 30% • a similar increase in the heat dissipation areas, hence lower pad wear. Exhaustive testing has been conducted in cooperation with European manufacturers. Anticipated advantages have been confirmed. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820028. The Mercedes-Benz OM 403 VA - a standard production, compression-ignition, direct-injection multifuel engine. H. O. Hardenberg and H. W. Buhl, Daimler-Benz AG (Stuttgart, Germany). The Mercedes-Benz direct-injection diesel engine OM 403 VA resulted from the military demand for a multifuel engine based on and sharing a maximum of parts of a mass-produced commercial vehicle engine. The path of development was paved with a great many problems and setbacks, and finally lead some years ago to the standard production of this engine. A great deal of experience and information was obtained which could be of interest for the future development of multifuel engines. The results achieved are of current significance both as regards the expected deterioration in the ignition quality of conventional diesel fuels and because of the need in the future to use alternative fuels of very poor ignition quality.

This paper describes a new turbocharged diesel engine which has been developed to meet market requirements for better fuel economy for heavy-duty trucks in Japan. Besides the newly developed turbocharging system, the new engine features Isuzu's unique square combustion chamber, 4-valve design and roller tappets. Improvement of fuel economy and torque characteristics in the low and medium speed range was made possible mainly by adoption of a wastegate valve for boost control, computer designed exhaust system and matching of turbocharger characteristics with the square combustion chamber system and with Bosch type fuel injection system. 820030. Mack's E9 series V8 engines with chassis mounted charge air cooling. R. G. Billig and S. W. Heffner, Mack Trucks, Inc. A new 998 CID V8 engine series has been developed by Mack Trucks, Inc. to supplement its line of heavy duty diesel engines. These engines, the E9 Series, are available in two configurations-a 400 bhp (298 kW) high torque rise version and a 440 bhp (328 kW) conventional torque backup version. Increased horsepower and improved fuel economy were achieved through the development of a chassis mounted charge air cooler and a new four-valve cylinder head. In addition, significant durability improvements were obtained due to the reduced thermal loadings resulting from the lower charge air temperatures. Addi- tional noteworthy features include a new injection pump, improved lube oil system, advanced piston design, and proper selection of seals and gasket materials. 820031. IVECO diesel engine family for medium duty vehicles. C. Bassoli, G. M. Cornetti, and F. Cuniberti, IVECO Engrs. (Turin, Italy). A light weight diesel engine family having high specific power output (up to 21 KW/1) has been developed for medium trucks (7/13 ton) starting from existing 6-cyl in-line N/A and T/C DI engines with a single displace- ment equal to 0.915 liters. To meet future U.S. federal and California emission standards changes in combustion chamber shape, swirl level, injection system and turbo- charger matching have been introduced. Projections of fuel economy according to the new transient procedure 24</page><page sequence="6">proposed by EPA have been carried out. These have been compared with the projections of a conventional gasoline engine referred to the same vehicles. Finally the main relationships among the combustion parameters, fuel consumption and emissions have been explored. 820032. Isuzu's new 3.27L small direct injection diesel. Hideo Kawamura, Ryoji Kihara, and Motoyasu Kinbara, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Japan). The 4BC2 diesel is a small DI engine of 3.27 litres displacement and maximum power output of 100 PS(73.6 KW)/3500 RPM(JIS) developed for small truck appli- cation. This paper describes comparative study results indicating that this DI diesel offers approximately 15% fuel economy advantage over IDI of the corresponding displacement and DI noise levels are 3-5 dB(A) lower at idling and the same or lower at full load compared with IDI. Also covered are the DI features which leads to improvement of coolant heat-up performance to the same levels as with IDI. 820033. Caterpillar 3306 Dita truck engine. L. R. Thompson, Supervising Engineer, Engine Divi- sion Engineering, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A new heavy duty diesel truck engine, the 3306 DITA, has been developed by Caterpillar Tractor Co. The engine is an Inline 6 cylinder covering the 245-270 hp (182-201 kW) range. A primary objective of the development program was a 7-10% reduction in fuel consumption while main- taining the durability, reliability, and serviceability re- quired of a heavy duty truck engine. Manufacturing considerations for high volume tooling were emphasized during the design stage. This paper deals with the design, development and performance aspects of the engine. 820034. The new Perkins mid-range diesel family - design and application. R. C. Mcintosh and D. E. Larkinson, Perkins Engines Limited, Peterbor- ough, England. A major new family of mid-range diesel engines, desig- nated Q14, which are primarily turbocharged with charge-cooled and naturally aspirated options, has been designed by Perkins Engines Group to meet the needs of on and off-highway applications. The family of 3, 4, 5 and 6 cylinder inline engines will initially be brought to production with a top rating of 170 kW. The ever more stringent and in some cases contra- dictory requirements of today's market place have received assiduous attention during the evolution of the engine. Design, development and manufacturing needs have been closely co-ordinated to ensure a product that meets all requirements including all current and proposed controls on gaseous emissions, smoke and noise, even at high volume production, but which still has a satisfactory cost structure. In this paper the six cylinder engine concept and design are described together with the subsequent engine application development. 820037 820035. A numerical study on the effects of fluid motion at inlet-valve closure on subsequent fluid motion in a motored engine. Sherif H. El Tahry, Engine Research Department, General Motors Re- search Laboratories, Warren, MI. A multidimensional computer model was used to assess the effects of the initial swirl level, swirl velocity distribution and turbulence kinetic energy level at inlet- valve closure on the turbulence level and mean motion during the compression stroke of a motored reciprocating engine. Two piston geometries were considered in the study. The first was a flat-crown piston and the second was a piston with a reentrant bowl. For the test cases examined, the salient results obtained were the following: (a) both mean motion and turbulence level near top dead center (TDC) are sensitive to variation of the initial level of swirl, (b) both the turbulence and the mean motion are influenced by the shape of the initial swirl-velocity profile independently of the level of swirl, and (c) the value of the turbulence kinetic energy at inlet-valve closure has no effect on the turbulence near TDC in the presence of swirl. In the absence of swirl, however, the initial levels of turbulence did have a small influence on turbulence near TDC. 820036. Computer analysis of fuel-air mixing and com- bustion in an axisymmetric D.I. diesel. A. D. Gosman and P. S. Harvey, Imperial College of Science and Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Fluids Section, London. Progress is described on the development of a multi- dimensional method for the prediction of the detailed in-cylinder events in a firing D.I. Diesel engine. An existing method incorporating fluid dynamics and spray representations is extended to include a combustion model, of a kind which allows in an approximate way for both chemical-kinetic and turbulence effects on the burning rate. An example calculation is presented which demon- strates that, with appropriate adjustments to the empirical coefficients of the combustion model, the method pro- duces qualitatively realistic predictions of the major phases of the combustion process, including ignition, premixed burning and diffusion burning. The results also serve to illustrate the usefulness of multi-dimensional methods in revealing the causes of inadequate perform- ance. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820037. A method for the quantification of front disc brake squeal. William J. Bracken and Johnny K. Sakioka, Jr., Ford Motor Co. A subjective in- vehicle evaluation system is generally used to evaluate brake noise. This approach is quite dependent on analysis procedure, individual hearing abilities, indi- vidual tolerance level to the noise, the vehicle condition, road conditions and weather conditions. Due to the resultant subjective rating's dependence on these noncon- trollable factors, it was decided to develop an empirical 25</page><page sequence="7">820037 laboratory technique using the brake dynamometer with sensitive noise measuring equipment to collect sufficient data on brake noise to allow engineers to study brake noise problems. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820038. On the scaling of transient laminar, turbulent, and spray jets. T.-W. Kuo and F. V. Bracco, Dept. of Mechanical and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ. Through numerical solutions of appropriate two-dimen- sional unsteady conservation equations, it is found that transient laminar incompressible jets, turbulent incom- pressible jets and non vaporizing and vaporizing sprays reach steady state around the back of their head vortices. Thus, for many applications, the stems of such transient jets can be considered in steady state and steady state information can be applied to large fractions of transient jets. Equations are given for the penetration rate of such jets. In particular, an equation is obtained for the penetration rate of the tip of sprays that compares favorably with measured ones. Also, scaling laws are reported that are obeyed by each of the three families of jets. Since the laws are somewhat different, no precise similarity exists among the three types of jet. However, one type of jet can still be approximately simulated by another but only with respect to certain parameters and within definite time and space ranges, given the accept- able error. 820039. Direct-injection stratified-charge engine compu- tations with improved submodels for turbulence and wall heat transfer. Ramachandra Diwakar, Engine Research Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Compared to results in a previous publication by this author, new computations using more realistic submodels (logarithmic law-of-the-wall) for wall heat transfer and wall shear stresses showed better agreement with exper- imental data from a DISC (Direct-Injection Stratified- Charge) engine. The computation preserved the good agreement in measured trends of the HC and NO emissions which was observed in the previous results. The effects of the improved submodels (logarithmic law- of-the-wall and k-€ turbulence model) on the computed fluid-flow field and combustion are discussed. 820040. Modeling of turbulence in internal combustion engines. T. Morel and N. N. Mansour, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. One of the most widely used models of turbulence for the calculation of complex flows is the k-e model. However, it has been recently pointed out by W. C. Reynolds that this model does not correctly represent the behavior of homogeneous turbulence in the special case of "rapid" spherical compression. His observation is highly relevant to flows subjected to large density changes, in which flow compression may be considered to be very rapid, such as those generated in engines. Reynolds suggested that the dissipation equation of the k-e model should be modified in order to represent correctly the special case of a rapid spherical compression. However, the types of compression occurring inside engine cylinders are not spherical in general; for example, piston motion generates a unidi- rectional (axial) compression. Because of this, the original analysis of Reynolds has been generalized and extended to more general types of compression. Sample calculations have been made of the turbulence inside a piston-engine geometry with 8:1 compression ratio. When the original model was used, a sharp increase in turbulence length was predicted, resulting in a length scale up to several times larger than the cylinder clearance height. By contrast, the modified turbulence model predicts a physically more plausible behavior. 820042. Multi-color FIP™ (Fluorescent Indicator Panel) for automotive applications. Yukitoshi Yoshida, Togo Miyazaki, and Fukuji Maruyama, Nippon Electric Co., Ltd. (Kanagawa, Japan) (Kago- shima, Japan). The Fluorescent Indicator Panel (FIP) is now widely used in many automotive applications due to its bright, eye-pleasing blue-green color and ease of driving. The recent development of multi-color FIPs has expanded many new possibilities in the automotive application product area. The brightness levels of available phosphors have been evaluated to consider their feasibility for automotive use. Brightness levels are an important characteristic, and new concepts are being developed to further improve bright- ness. These new concepts will be discussed. 820043. Turbulent flame structure in a homogeneous- charge engine. J. Ray Smith, Combustion Ap- plications Div., Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA. To gain insight into the mechanism of turbulent flame propagation, a technique using imaged Rayleigh scat- tering has been developed to directly measure turbulent flame thickness in an operating engine. Spatial resolution of 0.1mm and time resolution of 0.01 microsecond were achieved by using a multielement detector and a pulsed laser. The use of two laser pulses to simultaneously measure flame thickness and propagation speed was also demonstrated. Mean flame thickness was found to increase gradually from slightly greater than laminar values at very low rpm to two to three times the laminar value at 1800 rpm. The standard deviations of the thickness distributions in- creased with increasing engine «peed. There was also an increasing probability of small "islands" of unburned mixture being found immediately behind the flame front as rpm increased. Variations in fuel and equivalence ratio were found to have a small effect on thickness. Discussion: J. C. Kent, Ford Motor Co. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 26</page><page sequence="8">820044. The effect of spark location on combustion in a variable-swirl engine. Peter O. Witze, Combus- tion Technology Dept., Sandia National Labs., Livermore, CA. Measurements are presented showing the effect of swirl level and spark location on burn duration in a homo- geneous-charge engine. Laser shadowgraph photographs of the flame structure were used to help interpret the observed results. As expected, without swirl the burn duration was a direct function of flame travel distance, such that central ignition was optimal. When swirl was introduced, off-axis ignition was aided by flame-holder effects that enhanced the flame speed in the circumfer- ential direction. However, only for the highest swirl level studied (swirl number = 8.3) was the burn rate increased by moving the ignition point toward the cylinder wall. For lower swirl levels, central ignition was still preferable. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820045. The effect of in-cylinder flow processes (swirl, squish and turbulence intensity) on engine effi- ciency - model predictions. G. C. Davis, Engi- neering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co.; and C. Borgnakke, Mechanical and Applied Mechanics Dept., University of Michigan. A computer simulation for the performance of a four- stroke spark-ignition engine is used to assess the effects of in-cylinder flow processes on engine efficiency. The engine simulation model is a thermodynamic model coupled to submodels for the various physical processes of in-cylinder swirl, squish and turbulent velocities, heat transfer and flame propagation. The swirl and turbulence models are based on an integral formulation of the angular momentum equation and a K-c turbulence model. These models account for the effects of changes in geometry of the intake system and the chamber design on in-cylinder flow processes. The combustion model is an entrainment burn-up model applicable to the mixing controlled region of turbulent flame propagation. The flame is assumed to propagate spherically from one or two spark plug locations. A heat transfer model that is dependent upon the turbulence level is used to compute the heat loss from the unburned and burned gases. These submodels are calibrated from experimental data. In this paper a combustion system featuring high and low swirl generating ports, a flat head and various piston designs is investigated. A parameter study is conducted to determine the effects of in-cylinder geometry on burn duration, heat transfer and fuel consumption. These results indicate that swirl, squish and turbulence intensity levels can be varied to produce a minimum in fuel consumption for the conditions examined. In addition, the isolated effect of the turbulence intensity on engine efficiency is presented for various EGR levels. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820048 820046. Errors in NO emission prediction from spark ignition engines. E. H. James, University of Technology, Loughborough (England). An extensive literature survey has been made of the formation mechanisms involved in NO generation within the flame front ("prompt NO") and in the post-com- bustion gases. Computer models having a uniform temperature and composition in the burnt charge are shown to be inaccurate in predicting NO. Improvements can be achieved by the incorporation of a one-dimen- sional temperature gradient and partial mixing in the burnt gases. However, the development of models in which heat transfer is confined to a multi-element "thermal boundary layer" is required for the most accurate predictions. Limited results from one such model are presented. 820047. A rationale for advances in the technology of I. C. engines. J. D. Dale, Univ. of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.; and A. K. Oppenheim, Univ. of California, Berkeley, CA. This paper is based upon the premise that the best way to deal with current constraints imposed upon car engines is by technological advances designed to (1) minimize pollutant emissions, (2) maximize engine efficiency, and (3) optimize tolerance to a wider variety of fuels. A sense of direction for such advances is derived from a critical assessment of the fundamental advantages of recipro- cating I.C. engines as prime movers for automobiles, and the review of their recent developments. On this basis it is shown that major impact in this respect could be made by controlled combustion. Intrinsically, this should involve proper handling of active radicals, the essential elements of the combustion reaction. Practically, this can be achieved by a variety of means, such as charge strati- fication, exhaust gas recirculation, homogeneous lean burn, combined with enhanced ignition and enhanced auto-catalysis. 820048. Cooling testing: operating conditions and tem- perature goals. Jerry P. Lindsay, Chrysler Corp. Cooling testing conditions and temperature goals have been established based upon critical high ambient tem- perature field sites in the southwestern U.S. Mountain grade-climbing, level highway, build-up, city traffic, and idle tests are included. They are used for the evaluation and development of engine and transmission cooling systems and various underhood and underbody compo- nents and systems. The procedures are designed for testing in a climat- ically-controlled wind tunnel, but are also suited, with appropriate adjustments, for road testing. Substantial reductions in product weight and cost have been achieved while maintaining customer satis- faction by the application of these procedures which replaced previous unrealistically severe test conditions. 27</page><page sequence="9">820050 820050. Comparisons of thermocouple, time-averaged and mass-averaged exhaust gas temperatures for a spark-ignited engine. J. A. Caton, Mechanical Engineering Department, Texas A&amp;M Univ. Accurate knowledge of engine exhaust gas temperatures is important for engine design and diagnostic efforts. To survive the harsh exhaust gas environment, most practical devices for determining exhaust gas temperatures are relatively large. Because of their size, these devices do not provide instantaneous gas temperatures but provide a single equilibrium temperature. This investigation com- pared computed thermocouple equilibrium temperatures of the exhaust gas to computed time-averaged and mass-averaged gas temperatures for nine different engine conditions. Mass-averaged gas temperatures are directly related to the exhaust gas energy whereas thermocouple and time-averaged gas temperatures are not directly related. For most of the engine conditions of this study, the exhaust gas energy based on time-averaged gas temperatures was about 10% lower than the energy based on mass-averaged temperatures and the energy based on thermocouple temperatures depended on the thermocou- ple properties. The mass-averaged, time-averaged and thermocouple exhaust gas temperatures varied as a function of engine conditions. For a spherical thermocouple with a diameter of 0.076 cm and an emissivity of 0.85, the computed thermocouple equilibrium temperature was about 20 K lower than the time-averaged exhaust gas temperature for variations in engine speed, spark timing and equivalence ratio. Variations in engine load did not appreciably change the thermocouple equilibrium temperature, how- ever the time-averaged gas temperature decreased for increasing engine loads. The thermocouple temperature for a fixed engine condition was examined as a function of thermocouple emissivity, diameter and shape. The calculations resulted in thermocouple temperatures which increased for de- creasing values of emissivity for all thermocouple diam- eters and for decreasing values of the thermocouple diameters for moderate to high emissivities. For low emissivities, decreasing thermocouple temperatures were obtained for decreasing values of the thermocouple diameter. 820051. Automatic emission testing system for light duty diesel. C. Bassoli and B. Tosco Filtri, IVECO Engineering (Turin/Italy). Emission testing of light duty diesel engines performed by means of a number of testing facilities that are connected to a central control system is described. Two kinds of benches are available: steady state and inertial. The first is mainly used to obtain emissions and fuel consumption maps in a fully automatic fashion. The data are then processed to predict the fuel consumption and emissions of a given driving cycle. The other kind of bench performs a comprehensive car simulation and therefore permits the execution of dynamic cycles such as the 1975 Federal Test Procedure (FTP). Both the diluted gas sampling and the driving actuation are automatically done by computer. Experimental results obtained on a IVECO 4-cyl turbocharged IDI diesel engine for light duty operation are presented. 820052. Ignition timing tester. A. Brandt, D. Fox, and T. Hsieh, Ford Motor Co. Spark timing is known to be a critical variable for engine performance. It is important to measure timing under transient conditions as well as steady state timing. Such transients include accelerations, decelerations and rough idle situations such as those occurring in engines tested directly off the production line. Conventional measurement devices have performance limitations. Timing lights will not measure transients and are limited in accuracy due to tolerance stack-ups and parallax effects. Some spark protractors require the use of externally mounted optical shaft encoders which are accurate but require a difficult mounting procedure. Such encoders are also susceptible to contamination and vibration. Other spark protractors operate under the assumption of steady state conditions by equating time with engine rotational angle. This eliminates the need for a shaft encoder but suffers in accuracy under transient conditions. The instrument described herein overcomes these limitations by using shaft encoding mechanisms readily available on any engine. The signals from these crude encoders are enhanced by a microprocessor to obtain accurate results. The microprocessor is programmed to calibrate the encoder and read spark timing and engine RPM once every distributor rotation or complete engine cycle. 820053. Dynamic diesel engine timing with microwaves - the General Motors approach. Mark K. Krage, GM Research Laboratories.; John H. Lienesch, Chevrolet Engineering.; and David M. Violetta, Oldsmobile Div., General Motors Corp. Conventional production methods for setting initial pump timing in indirect injection diesel engines are subject to tolerance stack-up errors which contribute to vehicle- to-vehicle variations in tailpipe emissions and smoke levels. This problem has been addressed through the development of a new dynamic timing apparatus in which injection pump timing adjustments are made under hot-test conditions. The new timing apparatus employs microwave sensing of the combustion chamber to deter- mine the dynamic piston top dead center (TDC) of a cylinder to within ±0.1° Crankangle. Furthermore, the onset of prechamber luminosity, rather than injector needle motion, is used as the signal to be timed. This signal is abrupt, readily detectable and more directly related to engine performance than is start of injection. Both the microwave and luminosity sensing functions are integrated into a single probe which is used in place of a glow plug. 28</page><page sequence="10">Experimental results which illustrate the accuracy of the location of TDC by microwaves and the dependence of prechamber luminosity on engine operating conditions are given. In addition, data are presented which indicate that the dynamic timing method can significantly reduce the initial timing related vehicle-to-vehicle variation of exhaust emissions. The production implementations of this timing system by Chevrolet and Oldsmobile are also described. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820054. An angular sensor for transmission error inspec- tion. V. Milenkovic and S. Shmuter, Ford Motor Co. To serve the need of in-line rear axle diagnostics as well as other types of transmission inspection, an angular sensor development has been undertaken. It has resulted in a new device, incorporated into a system which performs angular error sensing at three levels. High precision of better than 0.003% in velocity variations is achieved. A continuous check of the null-error status of the devices is maintained in order to ensure maximum reliability of the readings. An easy on-site calibration check is available which eliminates the need for any precision calibrating fixture. The device is configured to accommodate a pass-through drive shaft for in-line mounting. A rugged design and immunity to rotor imperfections are advantageous in a plant envi- ronment.

Isamu Usami and Hidekatu Miyake, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.; and Osamu Saitoh, Kozo Ishida, and Kimio Miyatake, Horiba, Ltd. This report describes a new, maintenance-free exhaust gas analysis system for automobile quality control. It incor- porates non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) gas analyzers employing a cross-flow modulation method which pro- vides virtually drift-free performance and eliminates the need for optical adjustment. Analyzer modulation is by means of alternating the flow of sample gas and reference gas into two cells with a rotary valve of simple construc- tion. Microcomputers are used for system control and to process the data. This system measures oxides of nitrogen (NOx), total hydrocarbon (THC) and carbon monoxide/dioxide (CO/ CO2) with three analyzers. Full scale ranges of 50 ppm for NOx and 20 ppm for THC are feasible with cells merely 35 mm long. In each case the signal-to-noise ratio is 100. In actual operation, the system drift was so low that it required no span calibration over a period of three months. By use of various self-diagnostic features, this system achieved virtually maintenance-free operation; the first of its kind in such a measuring system. By providing accurate automobile exhaust gas measurement on an automobile production line, the system contributed greatly to quality control. 820063 820056. Women in engineering: a non-traditional re- source. Patricia M. Shamamy, Lawrence Insti- tute of Technology.; and Rebecca M. Adams, Delco Moraine Div., General Motors Corp. A profile of the woman engineering student and the professional woman engineer is presented, along with an analysis of why she chose engineering and how she compares with her male counterpart. The impact of women engineers on society and that of society on women engineers is examined. The second half of this paper deals with the personal aspects of being a woman engineer. The concerns of a woman engineer in the workplace and in the home are discussed along with some differences between male and female engineers and some problems unique to women engineers. 820059. Video based manufacturing engineering programs. William B. Cottingham, General Motors Insti- tute. Intense pressures from changing market forces, socio- economic conditions and technological development are being felt by American manufacturing corporations. Maintaining a proper mix of technology, human re- sources, and management is not a new issue, however the optimization of the mix is more important than ever. These corporations are becoming acutely aware of the need to use technology to improve productivity and quality. Much of that technology now exists and the problem centers on the "transfer of technology" to the human resources who can apply it. 820060. Computer-aided engineering education. James E. A. John and Gary L. Kinzel, Mechanical Engineering Dept., The Ohio State Univ. The Advanced Design Methods Laboratory (ADML) was established in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Ohio State in 1977. This lab has the goal of integrating computer and interactive graphics into the teaching and research programs of the department. Currently, every Mechanical Engineering student at Ohio State uses computer graphics in junior-level courses in mechanical design; the ADML is involved in 12 courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Increased application of the ADML is also occurring in research, with projects using computer and interactive graphics in the areas of machine element design, truck braking, V-belt transmis- sions, auto safety, pedestrian safety and linkage synthesis. 820063. Hydrocarbon combustion near a cooled wall. R. J. Blint and J. H. Bechtel, Physics Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. An experimental and theoretical investigation of a flame/wall interface is presented to help understand the phenomenon of one-wall quenching. Special slot burners were designed to permit high spatial resolution, laser probing of the flame/wall interface, often referred to as the wall quench zone. Laser Raman spectroscopy and velocimetry measurements of the fuel, temperature, and velocity in the flame/wall interface region show that the 29</page><page sequence="11">820063 fuel is consumed rapidly «5 ms) in spite of the low (~1000 K) temperature. Flame ionization detector meas- urements confirm the absence of exhaust hydrocarbon from these premixed, laminar flames. Measurements of OH near the wall, taken together with a theoretical study of combusting flows for the burner geometry, identify species diffusion of fuel and radicals as the important process in the fuel decay. Relative flame-wall motion was shown to have only a weak influence on the results. These conclusions suggest that one-wall quenching in homo- geneous change, S.I. engines is not a likely source for exhaust hydrocarbons. 820064. Solving the battery connection problems. Meril Monashkin, Burndy Corp., Norwalk, CT. This paper describes the problems associated with battery connections, tests designed to evaluate connections, and the resultant connectors and installation tooling that were developed. 820065. A mass-terminated conductor for flat conductor, flat flexible cable and circuitry. Marek T. Luksie, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Berg Electronics. The use of flat conductor, flat flexible cable and circuitry has increased steadily within the electronics industry. This is because of the electrical and mechanical advantages offered by flat conductor cable and circuitry, particularly with respect to mechanical durability over millions of flexure cycles. In order to integrate flat conductor cables econom- ically into electronic equipment made in high volume, a termination technique which is both rapid and reliable is required. Berg Electronics has developed the Clincher™ connector to meet this need. The Clincher™ connector offers low applied cost (by using a mass termination technique) as well as the high reliability required in today's electronic hardware market. The following presentation describes the Berg Elec- tronics Clincher™ interconnect system for flat conductor, flat flexible cable and circuitry, and how it can be used most effectively to minimize applied cost. 820067. Interconnection in automotive electronics. B. S. Watts, AMP Great Britain Limited, Stanmore, Middlesex. The current state-of-the-art in interconnection technology for automotive applications and wiring harness produc- tion techniques are described. The advantages of the central electric box are outlined. Future possibilities for further development are envisaged, particularly in mul- tiplexing systems and fibre optics. 820069. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)-a new dimension in electronic system qualification. James G. Harvey, Robert A. Meade, Kin P. Moy, and David D. Bailey, Packard Electric Div., General Motors Corp., Warren, OH. Susceptibility of electronic systems to the electromagnetic environment of the automotive vehicle has opened a new dimension in electronic system qualification. Electro- magnetic compatibility testing of these systems must be implemented to assure proper operation in the real world. Methods of reproducing the electromagnetic environment under controlled conditions and techniques for subjecting electronic systems to this environment are reviewed. Current methods of improving system electromagnetic immunity are also discussed. 820070. Palladium- and solder-plated connectors for the automotive industry. Lee R. Conrad, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Berg Electronics. The low signal level microprocessors used in automobiles require very good electrical connections. Typically, these connectors are gold-plated. Work has been done to show that gold-plated connectors need not be used in many circumstances. Extensive testing on two specific connector geometries compares palladium- and solder-plated con- nectors to gold. The results presented in this paper show that palladium and solder (60/40 or 90/10 tin/lead) perform equivalently to gold on properly designed connectors. This performance is maintained even in very extreme environments such as salt spray, hydrogen sulfide, mechanical, thermal, and vibrational shocks, as well as combinations of these environments. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820071. An in situ determination of the thermal properties of combustion-chamber deposits. C. L. Anderson, Michigan Technological Univ.; and O. A. Uyehara and P. S. Myers, Univ. of Wisconsin. A technique for making a radiometric measurement of the deposit surface temperature in a methane-fired engine was developed. The wave-length region between 3.5 and 4.1 /mi was investigated. It was determined that while the combustion gases were relatively transparent, the surface temperature measurements would contain some gas radiation. A method of averaging the measurements of many cycles and correcting these data for the gas radiation was developed. Time-averaged surface temperature was used in a steady-state heat transfer analysis to determine deposit thermal conductivity. Deposit thermal diffusivity was determined from a transient experiment in which the engine's ignition system was turned off and the cooling response of the deposit and wall were measured. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820072. A theoretical study of engine deposit and its effect on octane requirement using an engine simula- tion. Anthony J. DeGregoria, Corporate Re- search-Science Labs, Exxon Research and En- gineering Co., Linden, NJ. An engine model is developed which incorporates the physical effects of deposit. Engine octane requirements are calculated from the model's unburned gas tempera- ture-pressure tracks using a recent empirical expression for the autoignition delay of hydrocarbon-air mixtures. The computed octane requirement for the clean model 30</page><page sequence="12">engine is in reasonably good agreement with experimental values, as is the octane requirement increase (ORI) due to the increase in compression ratio caused by the assumed deposit. The computed ORI due to the thermal effects caused by the deposit is too low by a factor of approximately 3, however. Possible explanations for this unresolved discrepancy are discussed. 820073. A new technique to detect and control knock damage. François Renault, Research Labora- tories, TOTAL C.F.R., Centre de Recherches, Harfleur, France. High speed knock leads in particular circumstances to serious damage. Several mechanisms may be the source of deteriorations: - preignition usually due to the presence of deposits. - overheating ruining immediately the engine when a "runaway knock" occurs. - gradual decay of the combustion chamber depending on the design of the chamber and on the quality of materials. Analysing the temperature of the exhaust gases and establishing special testing techniques make possible the quantitative study of knock damage. The paper gives examples of matching of fuels and engines at knock damage limit. 820074. Individual-cylinder knock occurrence and inten- sity in multicylinder engines. W. R. Leppard, Fuels and Lubricants Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. To increase our understanding of engine knock, the cycle-to-cycle variations of knock occurrence and knock intensity in and among the individual cylinders of two multicylinder production engines run at steady speeds have been investigated. Statistical analyses, including autocorrelation analysis and cross correlation analysis between cylinders, showed that knock occurrence and intensity are random and depend solely on the conditions of each individual firing cycle. Individual cylinder knock occurrence and intensity correlated with cylinder pressure development. 820075. Detecting small differences in fuel economy: air conditioning versus open windows. Glenn F. Roberts and Axel B. Rose, Transportation Energy Group, Energy Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN. An experimental procedure for detecting small changes in automotive fuel economy via on-road testing is described. The approach uses standard statistical methods for experimental design. The procedure is demonstrated by measuring the change in fuel economy caused by using air conditioning and by opening side windows. Analysis of results for two test vehicles shows that the air conditioning effect is significantly greater than that of open windows for both vehicles. This result is consistent with estimates based on the best available information, and is supported by recent results from other similar studies. 820078 820076. A comparative evaluation of mechanical seals for automotive air conditioning compressors. Thomas J. Labus, SCIRE Corp. The influence of materials selected for sliding couples, and the effects of seal design on overall seal performance in automotive air conditioning compressors were evaluated experimentally. Various carbon materials were investi- gated and dense, fine grained carbons were shown to give better performance. SEM analysis of the carbon materials provided insight to explain observed differences in performance levels. Comparative tests between a friction drive seal and an o-ring, positively driven style of seal, showed that the friction drive seal provided better performance based on minimizing oil and freon leakage. Oil and refrigerant leakage curves as a function of running time are provided for both seals for 600 hour tests. 820077. A new ultra lightweight automotive air condi- tioning compressor and clutch. G. T. Bennett and M. E. Gaines, General Motors Corp. The new lightweight DA-6 Automotive Air Conditioning Compressor and Clutch Assembly is the lightest weight, most versatile 164 cc displacement compressor available today. It was designed and developed by General Motors which has produced over 72,000,000 compressors begin- ning with a 26.3 Kg rotary in 1953. In 1961, the 15.1 Kg six cylinder axial design was introduced and still remains a standard for the industry. A lighter weight 8.1 Kg radial four started production in 1974 and in 1982 the light- weight 5.7 Kg DA-6 will be introduced. Features of the mechanism include: A) A unique lubrication system B) High strength piston design in conjunction with a special TFE ring eliminates the need for cylinder sleeves C) An integral wide band gas pulse attenuator eliminates external mufflers D) Smooth torque pulses simplify construction and reduce weight of the mounting bracketry; also eliminates the need for torque dampeners, inertia rings, and idler pulleys E) Optional direction of rotation F) Mounting arrangement may be rotated to provide more flexible application G) Mountings in the rear head provide for system control switch application. The clutch is a lightweight electromagnetic six-pole design that provides for a small diameter poly-vee pulley as well as a single "V" groove. The distance from the pulley to the front of the compressor is short which is an advantage when the compressor is mounted on an engine and bottom loaded into a car. SA E Trans., Vol . 91 820078. The effect of nonuniform inlet air temperature distribution on the sizing of the engine radiator. J. P. Chiou, Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Detroit. A mathematical method for determination of the heat 31</page><page sequence="13">820078 transfer effectiveness of engine radiator accounting for the effect of two-dimensional nonuniformity of the inlet temperature of the cooling air flow is presented. Using several typical models of the nonuniform inlet air temperature distribution, the effectivenesses of the engine radiator are calculated for various design/operating conditions. A Nonuniformity factor of the inlet air temperature distribution is introduced to characterize the maldistribution of the inlet temperature of the cooling air flow. The effect of the nonuniformity of the inlet air temperature distribution on the sizing of the engine radiator is discussed. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820079. Computer simulation of suspension abuse tests using ADAMS. N. S. Rai and A. R. Solomon, Chevrolet Engineering Center, Warren, MI.; and J. C. Angeli, Mechanical Dynamics, Inc., Ann Arbor, MI. ADAMS (Automated Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems) computer program is an excellent tool for solving non-linear, large-displacement dynamic problems. The suspension abuse events, e.g., curb, chuck hole, railroad ties and rough road impacts involve non-linear, large displacements of suspension components. ADAMS pro- gram and user written force subroutines are used to simulate these events. The modeling techniques to simu- late these abuse events assume a simple tire model (spring and damper). Simulation results are presented in the form of computer generated outputs of forces, accelerations, velocities and displacements. Additionally, computer graphics is used to animate the vehicle graphically during the abuse event. Specifically, the program is used to determine peak loads in suspension components during these events and these peak loads can be used as input loads for finite element analysis of suspension compo- nents. 820080. Synthesizing experience through the use of computer aided engineering. J. M. Thompson and M. R. Bethell, Structural Dynamics Re- search Corp. Road testing, computer-aided data reduction and finite element modeling of existing McPherson Strut systems are discussed as sources of reference data insight and experience. These technical activities are strategically folded together to build a timely decision making capability assisting an engineering organization entering an unfamiliar area of technology. Emphasis is placed on the strategic planning of these technical tasks and the need to organize results into concise forms which are directly usable by engineering decision-makers. Several examples of "refined" data presentation are offered. 820082. Process through which soot intermixes into lubricating oil of a diesel engine with exhaust gas recirculation. Naomi Tokura, Katsunori Tera- saka, and Seishi Yasuhara, Central Engineering Labs., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., Yokosuka, Japan. Diesel engines equipped with exhaust gas recirculation reduce NOx emissions; however, engine combustion causes large amounts of soot to be produced. This soot intermixes with and contaminates lubricants thereby adversely affecting engine durability. We focused our attention on the behavior of soot with EGR and the process by which soot intermixes with lubricant. Our study indicated that the amount of soot intermixing with lubricants is related to exhaust smoke and the EGR rate. Most of the soot intermixes with the oil film on the cylinder wall. Intermixing with blow-by gas is very small. 820083. Second generation Super Tractor Oil Universal. Graham H. Lord, Robert S. Hexter, and John P. Murphy Super Tractor Oil Universal (STOU) fluids are designed to lubricate all systems of a modern farm tractor with a single oil. The technology available for first generation genuine STOU's limited their application to oils of SAE 20W-30 viscosity. A second generation fluid has been developed which retains all of the performance capability of the first generation STOU, but in the wider and more versatile SAE 10W-30 viscosity grade. The improved low temper- ature viscosity characteristics allow use in cold climates, thereby opening a new range of geographical availability of the STOU concept and providing more universal application. 820084. A field correlation study of the sequence VD engine test. M. S. Miller, A. J. Lantagne, and H. H. Kube, Shell Canada Limited, Oakville Re- search Centre. Correlation has been shown between lubricant perform- ance in the Sequence VD Engine Test and field service with the same model 2.3L four cylinder engine used in the Sequence VD. Where inconsistencies exist between lab- oratory and field results, a safety factor was provided by the API SF performance limits of the Sequence VD. Insufficient information was available to show a corre- lation between Sequence VD performance and extended oil drain/filter change interval performance. The infor- mation generated by this evaluation could be of assistance in the future development of the Sequence VD Engine Test. 820085. Engine friction reduction for improved fuel economy. J. T. Kovach, E. A. Tsakiris, and L. T. Wong, Ford Motor Company. Recent fuel cost increases have changed engine cost/ben- efit design guidelines and, therefore, renewed interest in engine friction reduction. At a typical part throttle engine operating condition, the mechanical friction (including oil pump &amp; water pump) of a conventional four-cylinder engine consumes approximately 22% of the indicated 32</page><page sequence="14">power. A 1 psi (6.9 kPa) MEP reduction in mechanical friction can result in an EPA, M-H fuel economy improvement of l%-2%, depending on the engine/ vehicle configuration. This paper reviews various friction measurement methods and presents motoring friction data for several small engines (four and six cylinder). The friction of various components, including the valve train, pistons, rings and rods, seals and engine auxiliaries (alternator, water pump and oil pump) are also shown. Component design modifications for reducing friction are discussed, and projections and measurements of fuel economy gains for improved components are presented. Various valve train, oil pump, and piston ring designs are compared with regard to their mechanical friction characteristics. 820086. Piston thermal deformation and friction consid- erations. Chin-Hsiu Li, Mechanical Research Department, General Motors Research Labo- ratories, Warren, MI. The piston assembly is generally believed to account for a large percentage of the total engine mechanical power loss. Maintaining a proper running skirt profile and skirt-to-bore clearance at operating temperature is essen- tial in piston friction reduction. Pistons for current automotive engines are made of an aluminum alloy which has a thermal expansion coefficient 80% higher than that of the cast iron material commonly used for the engine block. The running clearance under engine operating conditions is, therefore, quite different from the design clearance, and a capability to compute the piston thermal expansion is needed. In this study, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed to calculate the piston operating temper- ature and the corresponding thermal expansion in the presence of asymmetric structural features such as a translot, a steel strut, and a pin boss. The model can be used to design skirt profiles which have the potential to decrease break-in time, reduce friction, and minimize piston slap. 820088. Flow in the piston-cylinder-ring crevices of a spark-ignition engine: effect on hydrocarbon emissions, efficiency and power. M. Namazian and J. B. Hey wood, Sloan Automotive Labo- ratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The flow into and out of the piston top-land crevice of a spark-ignition engine has been studied, using a square- cross-section single-cylinder engine with two parallel quartz glass walls which permit optical access to the entire cylinder volume. Schlieren short-time exposure photo- graphs and high speed movies were used to define the essential features of this flow. The top-land crevice and the regions behind and between the rings consist of volumes connected through the ring gaps. A system model of volumes and orifices was therefore developed and used to predict the flow into and out of the crevice regions between the piston, piston rings and cylinder wall. 820090 It was shown that two types of flow out of the top-land crevice entrance occur during the expansion stroke: (i) a low velocity flow which expands out of the crevice entrance, around the piston circumference, shortly after peak cylinder pressure occurs; (ii) a jet-type flow through the top piston-ring gap, later in the expansion process, which starts when the pressure above the ring gap falls below the pressure beneath the gap. Both these flows were observed when a production engine piston crown was inserted into the square-cross-section piston crown of the transparent engine facility in visualization experiments. The flow model was coupled with a ring motion model and applied to a real engine geometry. The model predicts the amount of unburned fuel trapped in the crevice regions, and calculates the portion of this trapped unburned fuel that is lost to the crankcase and the portion that returns to the combustion chamber. The effects of changes in ring gap area, volume of the crevice regions, wall temperature, load and piston speed on the amount of unburned fuel returning to the combustion chamber are examined, and are related to exhaust hydrocarbon emission trends. It is shown that these crevice gases constitute a major source of unburned HC emissions, as well as a significant loss in power and efficiency.

Wentworth, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. The sealed ring-orifice (SR-O) top compression ring was developed to reduce exhaust hydrocarbon emissions and blowby. Oil consumption, however, was often erratic. Results from this study demonstrate that oil control, blowby, and power output can be improved by changing the ring face profile. Three profiles were investigated: plain taper, taper- sawtooth, and crown. Oil consumption was lowest with the taper-sawtooth and crown-profile rings. The crown- profile rings had the lowest blowby, and their friction and exhaust hydrocarbon emissions were equal to, or less than, those of the other types. Overall, the crown-profile rings performed best. 820090. Wall effect on flame propagation in crevices. K. T. Rhee, Department of Mechanical and Aer- ospace Engineering, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ. The relationship of crevices to the formation of unreacted hydrocarbons in engine combustion remains to be deter- mined. In order to help understand its processes the present paper reports the experimental results obtained from the wall effect on flame propagation in various clearances which were placed in a constant-volume charged with premixed fuel-air gases. The photographic observations revealed that the flame propagation was accelerated in some clearances with both 33</page><page sequence="15">820090 ends open. Furthermore, it was discovered that there is an optimum clearance that creates the most rapid flame propagation through a contained combustible mixture. The smallest optimum clearance was measured in a slightly richer mixture than stoichiometric; the greater clearance was measured in leaner or richer mixtures exhibiting a characteristic quite similar to the dependence of quenching distance to fuel/air ratio. In clearances with one end open the flame propagated slower than outside the clearances. Consequently, a large portion of trapped mixture remained unreacted until the overall reaction was nearly complete. 820091. Cycle by cycle variations of flame propagation in a spark ignition engine. Stojan Pe tro vie, University of Belgrade (Yugoslavia). Results from theoretical and experimental studies of cycle-by-cycle variations of flame propagation periods during the combustion in spark ignition engine are reported herein. Theoretical considerations show that cyclic variations depend on mixture turbulence and homogeneity characteristics. During an experimental work two ionization probes have been used to define the flame formation and total propagation periods and to enable visual observation of flame propagation duration in a series of successive engine cycles. The effects of main factors (turbulence level, compression ratio and mixture homogeneity) affecting flame kernel formation and flame propagation cyclic variations are discussed in the paper. One of the main conclusions is that a high turbulence reduces variations of developed flame propagation period, but an improved mixture quality could be important for the flame initiation. Both factors decrease total cyclic variations, though the effect of turbulence is greater. 820092. Approaches to vehicle dynamics and durability testing. R. A. Lund and K. H. Donaldson, Jr., MTS Systems Corp. A test engineer faces a series of considerations (decisions) when designing a test program to conduct service history simulation testing of full scale vehicles (structures) in the laboratory. This paper proposes a logical decision path, with pertinent discussion of tradeoffs, which is intended to serve as a design guide in this process. A good deal of the authors' subjective opinion is included. The paper begins by presenting a model of how a test facility should interface to the total engineering process. This is important in establishing a proper division of responsibility for the validity and usefulness of test results. This is followed by a specific discussion of service history simulation testing for durability evaluation. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820093. Fatigue service histories: techniques for data collection and history reconstruction. A. Conle, Ford Motor Co.; and T. H. Topper, Univ. of Waterloo (Canada). A number of service fatigue history summarization statistics are examined for their suitability in regenerating the history in the laboratory. Evaluation criteria applied include: fatigue damage-per-level equivalence, implemen- tation simplicity, waveform similarity, and fatigue life equivalence. The results suggest that a three-dimensional "From-To" matrix that includes sequence information about the original variable amplitude histories, is optimal for service history reconstruction.

The Audi road simulator incorporates three hydraulic servo actuators applying forces at each tire contact point. In addition the steering wheel and the brake are operated with two further actuators; thus the test rig has 14 actuators working under "remote parameter control". The vehicle on the test rig is unrestrained so that the inertia forces are the only reaction forces, thus giving the best possible simulation. The paper describes the test rig and reports on initial experience and results. 820095. Simulation methods for evaluating passenger car ride comfort and the fatigue strength of vehicle components. A. Zomotor, K. Schwarz, and W. Weiler, Daimler-Benz AG. A road simulation method has been developed to investigate ride comfort and fatigue strength in the laboratory. A short description is given of the road profile generation technique used. The road to be simulated is recorded by driving the vehicle on the road and measuring the vertical accel- erations and the forces of each spindle. In the laboratory the transfer behavior of the vehicle is determined with the aid of an identification technique. An iteration process is used. The simulation of the road profile and the forces is realized in the laboratory with multi-channel electro- hydraulic equipments. Laboratory test results are shown and compared with road signals. 820096. Using simulated road surface inputs for dynamic analysis of heavy truck combination vehicles. Phil R. Pierce, Fruehauf Corp., R&amp;D Div. A tractor/trailer combination vehicle is a complex nonlinear structural system exposed in normal road use to a wide range of operating environments. A method of analyzing the dynamic structural behavior of this system using simulated road surfaces as excitation is presented. Techniques for handling the nonlinearities and relating dynamic structural response (deflections and stresses) to road surface inputs are presented. 820097. Computer-aided design of electrohydraulic control systems. Philip M. Leucht and Donald J. Mandley, Engineering Mechanics Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. 34</page><page sequence="16">A computer-aided design method has been developed to predict, from limited information or estimates about system components, the performance of an electrohy- draulic system under "feedback" control. The interactive computer program produces graphical solutions to step, ramp, and sine wave commands which allow the exper- imenter, designer, or engineer to optimize a particular experimental or prototype system for "best" performance in following the specified command. The simulated control system structure or an equivalent controller can then be implemented in hardware with an understanding of the realizable performance of the system before the components are purchased, fabricated, and assembled into the actual system. 820099. Driving method of electrochromic display. Y. Mori, Y. Okajima, and M. Shibata, Research &amp; Development Div., Asahi Glass Co., Ltd. (Yo- kohama/Japan). We have been developing a new practical driving method fitted to our electrochromic display (ECD). Our latest and improved method consists of temperature compensation circuit, which assures uniform contrast, and constant voltage supply, which provide on-segments uniform color in spite of different areas of segments. With this drive method, high contrast display can be accomplished without overcharge, and the contrast ratio can be brought up as high as 5. Another driving method is also introduced, which is a simplified version of the method above. This method assures long-life-cycle time (over 5 X 106 cycles) and is suitable for watch or clock application. The combination of high contrast driver and long-life driver opens the potential applicability of the ECD in the automobile-display instruments by its excellent readabil- ity. 820101. Microprocessor control for liquid crystal in- strument panel. Osamu Shimizu, Hirofumi Gotoh, and Hirotsugu Arai, Products Devel- opment Laboratory, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. (Amagasaki, Japan). An LCD instrument panel, which displays a vehicle's speed, an engine revolution, a fuel level and a coolant temperature, in digital or bargraph form on a single, large area LCD, has been developed. In adapting electronic items to the instrument panel, a single chip 8-bit microcomputer which manages most of the signal proc- essing with excellent software techniques, a specially designed LCD driver IC and some hybrid-ICs have been employed. In this way, a minimized electronic assembly and a very suitable display were designed so that mass-production became possible. 820103. Quantitative measurement and predictive tech- niques for radio frequency interference. Michael E. Medvec, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. A technique for measuring and predicting radio frequency interference has been developed which can quantify an individual component's performance. The assessment of a 820106 quantitative performance objective for each component provides a means to achieve a desired level of noise rejection for the system independent of environmental variances. 820104. Voice interface for transport aircraft cockpits. Thomas G. Jones, Lockheed-Georgia Co., Marietta, GA. Increases in air traffic density, reductions in crew complement and the interface requirements of more computer processing and data storage on aircraft of the future threaten to overload the motor and visual channels of the flight crew. Considerable success has been achieved in developing devices to permit voice communication between people and computers in the past decade and possibilities exist for using this technology to maintain cockpit workload at manageable levels. Lockheed-Georgia is developing a voice interface system for caution-warning, data entry, information retrieval and systems control as part of an Advanced Flight Station Simulator program. Efforts are currently underway to define the proper requirements and appli- cations for computer voice interface to achieve optimum interaction between people and machines under critical circumstances. 820105. Safer trip computers by human factor designs. F. Heintz and R. Haller, Robert Bosch GmbH (Stuttgart, F.R. of Germany); Fraunhofer-In- stitut für Informations- und Datenverarbeitung (Karlsruhe, F.R. of Germany).; and D. Bouis, Robert Bosch GmbH (Stuttgart, F.R. of Ger- many); Fraunhofer-Institut fu Informations- und Datenverarbeitung (Karlsruhe, F.R. of Germany). The need for more economic driving and the new possibilities of electronic equipment in cars lead to additional display and control devices for the driver. Such systems contain potential safety risks, if they are not designed with special emphasis on ergonomie require- ments. Several keyboard concepts for an information center (trip computer) were compared experimentally. By measuring operating time, eye fixation time to keyboard and display etc. it was discovered, that a so called sequence keyboard with one key corresponding to each display digit or column has several advantages compared with a 10-key telephone keyboard. Especially the fixation time to each keyboard as a measure of the potential safety risk differed by 0.5 to 1.0 second. The longer operating time for the sequence keyboard compared with the telephone keyboard does not impair traffic safety because the sequence keyboard mostly was actuated without fixation and in accordance with the traffic situation the input sequence was interrupted. 820106. Fault-tolerant software techniques. Mike R. Seeger, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Due to the electrically hostile environment that awaits a microprocessor based system in an automobile, it is 35</page><page sequence="17">820106 necessary to use extra care in the design of software for these systems to ensure that the system is fault tolerant. Common faults that can occur include program counter faults, altered RAM locations, or erratic sensor inputs. These faults are generally the results of EMI/RFI, battery under or over voltages, extreme temperature conditions, electrostatic discharge, or load dump. Although system hardware should be designed to eliminate the effects of these perturbations, it is often impossible and costly to provide complete hardware protection. This paper intends to show several software techniques for effectively minimizing the effect of these faults on overall system function governed by software algorithms. 820107.

Switching power supply design for automotive instrumentation. Steven K. Kirkman, Electronic Instrumentation and Features Engineering De- partment, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The use of large vacuum fluorescent displays in instru- ment cluster applications brings about the need for power supply inverters capable of providing an AC filament voltage in addition to the DC voltages required. In this paper, the design equations are developed for a switching flower supply that meets these requirements. Equations for capacitor ESR requirements for the DC outputs are also developed, and a typical supply is designed. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820110. A modular approach to electronic instrument cluster design. Thomas C. Nation, Electronic Instrumentation and Features Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Div., Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The Electronic Instrument Cluster is enjoying widespread usage in today's vehicles. The system organization of the cluster will have a major impact on cost, service and reliability. This paper will compare the advantages of a modularly organized cluster as compared to an integrated cluster. 820111. The GM 1.8 liter L-4 gasoline engine designed by Chevrolet. James W. Walker, Chevrolet Engi- neering Center, General Motors Corp. A completely new in-line, 4 cylinder engine has been designed by Chevrolet for use in the 1982, FWD, J-Car vehicle line.

In addi- tion, individual component and overall system designs and component development programs will be described. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820112. Forďs 1982 3.8L V6 engine. D. L. Armstrong and G. F. Stirrat, Engine Engineering Office, Ford Motor Company. The new 1982 Ford V6 overhead valve engine is the lightest weight V6 produced in North America, regardless of displacement. It has a 90° bank angle, even firing intervals and a bore and stroke of 96.8 X 86 mm for 3.8L displacement. It is released for the Granada, Cougar, Thunderbird, XR-7 and Continental passenger cars and F-100 light trucks, spanning an inertia test weight range of 3250 to 3875 pounds. This paper is intended to provide a brief overview of an all new engine program with descriptions of the unique design features and problems encountered and resolved with Ford's 1982 3.8L V6. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820113. Nissan Motor Company's new 2.0 liter four- cylinder gasoline engine. Takashi Hisatomi and Hiroshi lida, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. A new 2.0 liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine has been designed and developed for light weight front-wheel drive vehicles. In developing this new engine, the major target was to improve fuel economy, and this was achieved by mini- mizing the engine weight, reducing mechanical friction loss and improving combustion efficiency. Major prob- lems that had to be solved included assuring the durability of component parts, and reducing the noise and vibration caused by minimizing the weight of the engine structure. The basic concept of the Nissan NAPS-Z engine, which is fast burn combustion with a two-point ignition system, has been used and further improved in the new engine. To develop this new engine, all component parts were newly designed using computer design analysis tech- niques, and checked by extensive testing. This paper describes the design characteristics of the basic engine components and structures, and discusses the significant development factors. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820114. M 105 - a new turbocharged IDI diesel engine. K. Lange, B. Göschel, R. Henning, and F. Krame The potential to reduce fuel consumption was the main incentive for starting a diesel engine development at BMW. Compared with gasoline engines of the same rated 36</page><page sequence="18">power, diesels under part load conditions offer upwards of 25 percent improved fuel economy. The new engine, through the use of turbocharging, combines this advan- tage with the driving performance typical for BMW vehicles. The M 105 is of similar design to the 2.0 to 2.6 liter displacement family of BMW spark ignition engines. These engines, noted for their 6-cylinder, in-line smooth running characteristics, are combined with a compact size, a prerequisite for easier packaging in a wide range of applications. The main components of the diesel and spark ignition versions can be machined on the same transfer lines. The IDI combustion system offers a favorable com- bination of low fuel consumption, emissions and com- bustion noise. In particular, under part load conditions it has low particulate emissions. IDI is especially advan- tageous with small cylinder bores due to shorter flame travel. The offcenter position of the prechamber permits the large valve diameters which are required for high power output. 820115. The new GM 6.2L V8 diesel engine - designed by Chevrolet. D. J. Reilly, Chevrolet Engineering Department. The 6.2 liter 90° V8 is a new engine designed to provide diesel power in the General Motors standard size truck line. This paper describes its design features, outlines development and durability testing programs and dis- cusses development problems and their solutions. This engine was designed for compatibility with existing rear wheel drive train components and existing underhood packaging requirements. Materials, combustion chamber and fuel delivery system were selected for their proven performance and durability and have been combined to give excellent fuel economy and responsive performance. 820116. The new Isuzu 1.8 liter 4-cylinder diesel engine for the United States market. M. Higashisono, K. Takeuchi, and H. Hara, Light Duty Engine Design Dept., Isuzu Motors Limited (Fujisawa, Kanagawa, Japan). The new Isuzu 1.8-liter diesel engine was developed with our special efforts given to quiet operation, light-weight, high performance (SAE 38KW/5000RPM), easy handling (3.5 second pre-heat), meeting the U. S. statutory standards and market requirements, and to excellent fuel economy. This engine is mounted on the Isuzu I-Mark Diesel and Chevrolet Chevette Diesel which have been on the U. S. market since Spring, 1981. They deliver a fine EPA city fuel economy rating -30% better than their gasoline- powered compétitives. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820117.

Johnson, Oldsmobile Division of General Motors Corp., Lansing, MI. 820122 A detailed discussion of the new 4.3 liter V6 Diesel basic engine hardware is presented. Techniques are used which downsize the engine package and reduce mass while maintaining desired displacement. It includes new tech- nologies in cylinder head, intake manifold and accessory drive. 820118. Battery powered aerial devices in support of fuel conservation goals. Lee Redman, Georgia Power Co. In the early 1970's, well in advance of the "energy crunch", Georgia Power Company began to take some innovative steps in the area of fuel conservation for large trucks with aerial devices. The company made moves to battery power for aerial devices, integrated with automatic transmissions, diesel engine power plants and the estab- lishment of an in-house mechanic training program. The result has been substantial improvements in fuel conser- vation and a rapid sophistication of the aerial device fleet. 820119. Auxiliary power systems for aerial devices. Richard A. Moyer, Asplundh Manufacturing Division. The options for powering aerial lift devices are multiple. The choice of the most appropriate and economic configuration of truck engine and lift power supply is dependent on the type of work assignment the vehicle is used for and on the power supply combination. Power sources can be gasoline, diesel, propane and electric. Typical unit work assignments are service/trouble, line service/maintenance, line construction/material handling, and tree trimming.

Synthetic fiber double braided rope constructions have inherent performance characteristics that make these ropes ideally suited for use on vehicle mounted lifting equipment. The implementation of certain basic equip- ment design criteria and maintenance procedures when utilizing double braided ropes in this capacity will provide an extended service life for the rope and help to promote a safe working environment on site.

After over two years service in the "snow belt," class 12.8 bolts in GM "A" car rear suspensions began to fail, leading to the recall of 6.4 million cars. Analysis of the failures showed that the cause was corrosion induced hydrogen assisted cracking. The long delay before failure resulted from a decarburized surface through which corrosion had to penetrate before a crack could propa- gate. The fracture morphology of the field failures was duplicated in laboratory salt spray tests. This type of testing also showed that hardness was the principal factor 37</page><page sequence="19">820122 affecting durability in a corrosive environment. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820123. Medium carbon-boron steels for automobile components. Norioki Uyehara, Kenji Isokawa, and Yoshiharu Tanaka, Daido Steel Co., Ltd.; and Shigeo Kimura, Hisayoshi Kojima, and Yosuke Kawamichi, Nissan Motors Co., Ltd. In order to save molybdenum (Mo) in chromium - molybdenum steels for automobile components, medium carbon - boron steels were investigated. Boron is not a new alloying element for structural steels, however, to date boron steels have not been widely used because of their unstable hardenability and poor machinability. Therefore, in this paper, the optimum content of boron was reexamined, and also the appropriate addition of titanium as a stabilizer of boron was investigated from the view point of hardenability. Furthermore the upper limit of manganese (Mn) content was studied to keep good machinability. The new steel grades, established on the basis of the above fundamental research, have been used on vital components of passenger cars. 820124. Molybdenum-saving case hardening steel. T. Ohno, M. Fujita, K. Nishida, T. Ikeda, and F. Nakasato, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. The role of molybdenum and its substitute elements in carburized layer has been examined. Among substitute elements, chromium and manganese are effective to raise case hardenability. Chromium is also effective to raise surface carbon content. Boron suppresses over-carburiz- ing. Silicon enhances structure anomalies. Based on these results, five kinds of molybdenum- saving case hardening steels have been designed. These steels showed good carburizing properties. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820125. Non heat-treated vanadium alloyed steel crank- shaft. Hiroo Hashimoto, Yoichi Serino, and Yoshimi Aoyama, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.; and Karne taro Hashimoto, Takaoka Industrial Co., Ltd. Steel crankshaft is ordinally quench-tempered at forged state, and high frequency induction hardening is per- formed on it after machining. Authors have developed vanadium alloyed steel crankshaft which requires only air cooling after hot forging instead of the quench-tempering and the induction hardening. The air cooled vanadium alloyed steel had sufficient mechanical properties and wear resistance for crankshafts by precipitation of vanadium carbide or carbo-nitride at cooling process after forging. The difference of air cooled vanadium alloyed steel crankshaft hardness depended on the chemical composition and mass effect, and was satisfactorily small. The following effects *were obtained by eliminating the heat- treatment process: 1) Energy savings 2) Decreased process time 3) Decreased distortion 4) Machinability improvement 5) Reduction of total cost 820126. Continuously cast special steels and their appli- cations to automobiles. Kunio Yamaguchi, Kenji Isokawa, and Yohei Ito, Daido Steel Co., Ltd.; and Shigeo Kimura, Kiichiro Nagashima, and Yoshiya Nakamaru, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Extremely high quality is required for special steels employed for automobile components. Therefore careful consideration was given to maintain high purity, homo- geneity and sufficient reduction ratio prior to introducing a continuous casting machine. With this machine it became possible not only to produce steels with outstanding cold forgeability and fatigue strength but also to produce steels with highly homogeneous hardenability, machinability and distortion. Furthermore, estimation tests were carried out for automobile components and it was confirmed that continuous cast steels were performing as well as those ingot cast steels. 820127. High temperature carburizing steel bars for saving energy consumption in the automobile industry. Yoshiro Koyasu, Tetsuo Oosasa, Toshimichi Mori, Eiichi Oka, and Souichi Izumi, Nippon Steel Corp. Carburizing heat treatment is one of the automobile component manufacturing steps, which consumes a large amount of energy. Raising the carburizing temperature can shorten the carburizing time and save the energy, but involves the risks of grain coarsening and attendant property deterioration. The authors have clarified the precipitation behavior of aluminum nitride (A1N) in the automobile gear manufacturing process and the optimum precipitation of A1N in as-rolled steel bars to prevent the grain coarsening. Through the application of the con- trolled rolling technique to ensure the optimum precip- itation of A1N in continuously cast steel of uniform chemical composition, the authors have substantially saved energy while maintaining high quality, and devel- oped a high-temperature carburizing steel expected to minimize and stabilize quenching strains.

This paper summarizes a laboratory study aimed at revealing the effect of Chemical elements, Si, Cr, Mo and V, on the sag resistance and developing new steels with all the characteristics required for suspension coil spring in comparison with AISI 9260. It was found that as far as sag resistance is concerned an optimum silicon content exist (1.5 silicon) and chromium deteriorates sag resistance and molybdenum and vanadium improve it. Further studies showed that Si-Cr-V steels are the best spring steels available, particularly 1.5Si-0.5Cr-0.2V steel has all the required characteristics, e.g., good sag resistance, good decarburizing resistance and sufficient hardenability.

Div., Chuo Spring Co., Ltd.; and Toshiro Yamamoto and Ryohei Kobayashi, Res. Dept., Aichi Steel Works, Ltd. The addition of a small amount of vanadium and columbium into SAE 9260 was found to give the steel excellent sag resistance, caused by the precipitation strengthening of V and Cb. The precipitation strength- ening enhances the yield strengths in tension and torsion obtained from the specimens with various tempered hardness values after quenching from 900°C (1652°F). The sag resistance was estimated by means of load relaxation under the stresses of 1030 MPa (149 ksi) and 1128 MPa (164 ksi). Using this steel for coil springs is expected to reduce the weight by 25%, and several new models using the coil springs wound from V-Cb treated steels are going to appear in the market. 820130. New tapered-rod forming process for coil springs. Akira Ohno, NHK Spring Co., Ltd., Yokohama, Japan.; and Tetsuo Kato, Mako to Saito, and Yasuaki Kasai, Central Research Laboratory, Daido Steel Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan. An innovative tapered-rod forming process with high dimensional accuracy, nearly 100% yield, and a high production rate (1 rod/20 sec) has been developed. Temperature-dependency of the material's flow stress is utilized as a working principle; a rod with arbitrary taper can be formed by rapid pulling of a bar with precisely controlled longitudinal temperature distribution. Tapered rods manufactured by the new process and by the turning method have been confirmed to have the same spring properties, fatigue properties, and load-loss resistance as tapered-rod coil springs.

A method to stratify the fuel-air mixture along the cylinder axis of engines is described. Axial stratification, with the richest mixture near the top of the combustion chamber and the leanest mixture near the piston top, was obtained by imparting swirl to the intake air and by injecting fuel into the inlet port just before the end of the intake stroke. Axial stratification was developed in both single and multi-cylinder engines over the range of operating conditions tested. A production four-cylinder engine modified to operate with axially-stratified-charge, showed: increased combus- tion stability and tolerance to dilute mixtures; decreased fuel consumption; similar HC and CO emissions; lower NO emissions and octane requirement when compared with the unmodified engine operated at the same overall equivalence ratio.

Peters, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. An axially stratified, fuel-air mixture can be produced in an engine cylinder using inlet-port fuel injection and air swirl. Past work has shown that stratification decreased as fuel volatility decreased. This paper shows that the reason for this relationship is the entry of fuel droplets into the cylinder prior to the start of fuel injection. This phe- nomenon, presumably caused by wall wetting in the inlet port, increased the mixing of the fuel and air which reduced the stratification. Also, it was shown that (a) droplets were not uniformly distributed throughout the cylinder, (b) droplets were completely vaporized prior to ignition, and (c) the largest droplets entered the. cylinder under low inlet flow conditions.

Kuo and F. V. Bracco, Dept. of Me- chanical and Aerospace Engrg., Princeton Univ., Princeton, NJ. Computations are reported of transient axisymmetric pulsating and evaporating sprays that account also for drop collisions and coalescence. It is found that, for the same upstream and gas conditions, pulsating injections result in smaller drops than continuous injections. The difference is particularly marked at high gas densities and is due to the inhibition of collisions and coalesce of drops generated by the gas gap in between the pulses. However, the tip penetration rates are not markedly different for continuous and pulsating injections. For transient evap- orating sprays it is found that all drops except the largest evaporate within a well defined distance from the injector. Beyond this distance only vaporized liquid and entrained gas continue the penetration. For engine applications the length of the liquid core is found to be of the order of centimeters and sensitive to conditions. In particular it decreases with increasing injection pressure, gas temper- ature, and gas density. The sensitivity of the liquid core length to conditions may explain the different importance attached by different authors to the liquid phase in direct injection stratified-charge and Diesel engines.

Szostak, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. A significant aspect of trailering safety is the ability of a combination vehicle to stop with the same effectiveness as the tow vehicle alone. This paper describes the operation of electric and surge brake systems and presents analytical equations which can be used to predict stopping distances of these combinations as well as those trailers having no 39</page><page sequence="21">820135 brakes. Comparisons are then made to full scale brake performance tests with seven different trailers. Problems are discussed and recommendations for a trailer-alone brake test procedure are given.

Co., Garland, TX. Presently, there exist two classical analytical results that provide information regarding the lateral stability of car/trailer systems. These results are the directional stability equation for the automobile and the frequency and damping relationships for yaw oscillations of a trailer towed by a vehicle of infinite mass. Neither of these classical results provides an adequate description of car/trailer dynamic behavior because the associated classical models do not allow for any car/trailer inter- action. In this paper, basic analytical results for car/trailer lateral stability are developed. These results are validated by comparing critical speeds predicted by the new analytical solution with those obtained numerically using a standard eigenvalue technique. General observations based upon the analytical results are then presented. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820137. (SP-509) Crosswind response and stability of car plus utility trailer combinations. David H. Weir, Dynamic Research, Inc., Manhattan Beach, CA.; and Richard H. Klein and John W. Zellner, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. The results of a wind tunnel study and a computer simulation are used to determine the effects of aero- dynamics on the lateral-directional stability and crosswind response of passenger car/utility trailer combinations. Single and tandem axle utility trailer configurations, with and without drag reducing add-on aerodynamic fairings, were considered with both sedan and station wagon tow cars. Results showed that including aerodynamic terms in the six degree of freedom model reduces the trailer tow angle stability and damping by a few percent. More importantly, the random crosswind response, expressed in terms of tow car yaw velocity, was amplified about 20 to 30 percent when a drag reducing device was added to the trailer.

An interactive computer graphics program has been developed to help in vehicle design. The most important aspect is the use of a highly interactive interface between the user and the underlying analytical model. This allows for a closed loop design process and enhanced commu- nication in both directions, both to and from the program. The paper discusses how the program helps the user visualize the many facets of vehicle behavior, how the user can easily change the parameters of the vehicle, and how dynamic transient response is simulated.

Comparisons are made between a three wheeled vehicle with two wheels on the front axle, a three wheeled vehicle with two wheels on the rear axle, and a standard iour wheeled vehicle. Each vehicle's lateral stability, rollover stability during lateral acceleration, rollover stability while braking in a turn, and rollover stability while accelerating in a turn are determined. It is shown that for lateral stability, the three wheeled vehicle with two wheels on the rear axle is more stable than the four wheeled vehicle, which is in turn more stable than the three wheeled vehicle with two wheels on the front axle. For rollover stability the four wheeled vehicle is always stable as long as the vehicle's track width is greater than twice its center of mass height. The three wheeled vehicles are less stable than the four wheeled vehicle in terms of rollover stability. Vehicle track width to center of mass height relationships which govern rollover stability are developed for the three wheeled vehicles. Provided these relationships are ob- served, three wheeled vehicles can offer safe alternatives to four wheeled vehicles. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820140. (SP-509) Three-wheel passenger vehicle stability and handling. Paul G. Van Valkenburgh and Richard H. Klein, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA.; and Joseph Kanianthra, Office of Passenger Vehicle Research, National High- way Traffic Safety Administration, Washington, D.C. Eight 3-wheel passenger vehicles of both one-front and one-rear wheel configurations were tested and compared to similar-sized 4-wheel vehicles. The tests produced measures of overturn resistance, oversteer/understeer, transient responses to control and external disturbance inputs, and braking performance and stability. A com- parison was also made of a 4- to 3-wheel conversion, and the effects of various handling modifications were eval- uated. The results indicate that a properly engineered 3-wheel car can be made as stable as a properly engineered 4-wheel car, although the single front wheel configuration may be less stable in limit maneuvers.

This paper describes a new asbestos-free cylinder head gasket material where asbestos has not been replaced by 40</page><page sequence="22">the usual fiber alternatives but by a change in the basic material structure. In this concept, the metallic carrier or substrate plays an important role. Structure and characteristics of the new gasket material, as compared to those of conventional, asbestos containing, cylinder head gasket materials, are discussed; this comparison shows that the asbestos-free material excels in terms of relaxation and torque retention. Finally, engine tests on the asbestos-free material are described which confirm the favorable relaxation characteristics and, therefore, prove that the material is highly suitable for non-retorque cylinder head gasket assemblies. 820142. Development of low friction oil seals for auto- mobiles. Tatsuaki Yukimasa, Yoshio Kawahara, Masamichi Ohtaki, and Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd., Japan.; and Susumu lida and Yasuo Yamamoto, NOK Incorporated, U.S.A. Improvement of automotive fuel consumption is subject of saving energy today. Oil seals with low friction for automobile are required in the market. In this report, an idea for decreasing the friction of seals and its concreate countermeasure are discussed. It becomes clear that developed low friction seals have good sealing performance as same as present seals. 820143. Use of ethylene propylene rubber for sealing petroleum fluids in diesel engines. R. D. Her- camp, Cummins Engine Company, Inc. Most elastomer selection charts and application literature relating to elastomer usage recommend that ethylene propylene (EP) not be used in contact with petroleum fluids. However, when properly applied, EP rubber will successfully seal petroleum fluids in many diesel engine applications. The reason for this discrepancy is that industry generally equates "fluid resistance" (which really should be "resistance to swelling in fluid") to resistance to deterioration in fluid. An elastomer may be swelled by a fluid, and not be chemically deteriorated by that fluid, and conversely an elastomer may not be swelled by a fluid but be degraded by that fluid. This confusion could be eliminated if both fluid swelling and fluid degradation information were clearly reported. Successful applications of EP for static seals are described, design considerations are discussed, and a swell pressure measurement device is described. N SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820144. An influence of reciprocating motion of rotary shaft on sealing characteristics of oil seals for automotive transmission. Hiroshi Hirabayashi, Tatsuaki Yukimasa, Shuhzo Seya, and Masa- michi Ohtaki, Nippon Oil Seal Industry Co., Ltd., Japan.; and Akira Matsushima, NOK Incorporated, U.S.A. It is clear that excessive lip wear is one of the origin of oil seal leakage in the market. In this paper, follows are discussed; Oil seals used for the rear side of automotive 820149 mission gear case have excessive lip wear as typical failure mode, and the sealing characteristics of oil seals is influenced by reciprocating motion of rotational shaft with rough surface. 820147. The role of weight reducing materials in auto- motive fuel savings. C. L. Magee, Ford Motor Co. A framework for considering trade-offs between increased costs for lightweight materials and the attendant fuel savings accruing from weight reduction is developed in this paper. Two quantitative estimates of lifetime fuel savings due to weight reduction of a vehicle are derived. For substitution on an ongoing vehicle, available data suggest savings of about 0.26 gallons for the vehicle lifetime per lb. of weight reduction. When long-term changes in vehicles follow lightweight material feasibility, a range of estimates must be quoted; viz: 0.55 to 1.07 gallons for the vehicle life per primary pound saved. Considerations of trading these fuel savings against higher costs highlights two crucial issues: (1) the per- centage weight reduction achieved in the substitution and (2) fabrication cost penalties. These technical issues largely determine whether a given application saves over-all resources. In a broad, approximate manner, the present trade-off analysis is found to be consistent with recent substitution practice and with apparent future trends. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820148. Lightweight materials and life cycle energy use. Mary Anne Wheeler, Advanced Vehicle Engrg. and Technology, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The energy crisis and how to deal with it have become serious concerns over the last several years. With this concern, has come the concept of life cycle energy use (LCEU) which is based on the premise that the lowest energy consuming product in terms of manufacture and use is the preferred product. This paper clarifies the benefits of lightweight materials substitution on LCEU in light of conflicting data. Further, a discussion of factors influencing the magnitude of benefit is presented. 820149. Automotive materials decision: energy, economics and other issues. C. N. Cochran and R. H. G. McClure, Aluminum Company of America, Alcoa Laboratories. Cars making intensive use of weight saving materials offer significant savings in weight, fuel, and life cycle energy with savings increasing in this order: high strength steel, plastics and aluminum. Driver on-road experience and EPA fuel economy ratings are both considered in the comparisons. The value of lifetime fuel savings far outweigh material premiums in each case. The cost effectiveness of material options is shown to compete strongly with that of non-material options. Intense use of aluminum in vehicles 41</page><page sequence="23">820149 along with the most effective mechanical and aero drag improvements could avoid the need to downsize cars and trucks beyond the limits of comfort, utility, and safety in achieving very high fuel economies. 820150. Life cycle energy requirements for selected automotive sheet materials. Charles L. Kusik, Stanley E. Dale, Philip G. Gott, and Krishna Parameswaran, Arthur D. Little, Inc., Cam- bridge, MA. New design factors have to be considered in the selection of materials to be used in automobiles as a result of Federal Government mandates on fuel economy re- quirements. As a result of higher energy costs, automobile designers in specifying materials are now considering not only the cost of substitute materials but also material weight, since lighter car weight promotes fuel economy. Over the lifetime of a car, comparative life cycle energy use relationships were derived in this study for the three major materials used in making flat (sheet) products used in automobile manufacture: 1) steel, both carbon and high strength-low alloy, 2) aluminum, and 3) selected plastics. This study focused on substitution of one material for another on a given sized automobile. Results are pre- sented graphically showing weight trade-offs of one material against another in order to achieve equal life cycle energy use. 820151. Energy tradeoffs in automotive use of steel, fiber-reinforced plastics and aluminum. J. Cum- mings-Saxton, Energy and Environmental Sys- tems Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Illinois. The embodied energy, structural weight, and transpor- tation energy (fuel requirement) characteristics of steel, fiber-reinforced plastics, and aluminum were assessed to determine the overall energy savings of materials substi- tution in automobiles. In body panels, a 1.0-lb steel component with an associated 0.5 lb in secondary weight is structurally equivalent to a 0.6-lb fiber-reinforced plastic component with 0.3 lb in associated secondary weight or a 0.5-lb aluminum component with 0.25 lb of secondary weight. The total energy requirements of structurally equivalent body panels (including their embodied and life cycle transportation energies) are: steel (211.6 X 103 Btu), fiber-reinforced plastics (126.7 X 103 Btu), and aluminum (174.3 X 103 Btu). Fiber-reinforced plastics offer greatest improvements in embodied and total energy requirements, while aluminum achieves greatest savings in transportation energy. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820152. Energy features of magnesium production and use in automobiles. George B. Kenney, Massachu- setts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. Magnesium is the most energy efficient light weight metal available to the automotive engineer. Die cast magnesium automotive parts contain less primary production energy, require less energy to fabricate, and conserve more fuel over the service life of the vehicle than identical aluminum parts. The result is a 9 percent net energy return advantage over aluminum, its nearest light weight metallic competitor. This overall advantage is expected to improve and add to the incentive to expand the automotive usage of magnesium as energy costs continue to escalate. 820154. Air flow through poppet inlet valves - analysis of static and dynamic flow coefficients. Itaru Fuku- tani and Eiichi Watanabe, The Institute of Vocational Training (Japan). In order to investigate the air flow characteristics through poppet inlet valves, the static and dynamic flow coef- ficients were measured by varying through wide limits the angle-areas and the opening periods of the valves. As a result, it was found that when the angle-area was fixed, a valve having a lower maximum valve lift always showed better flow characteristics under both static and dynamic conditions. Also, a parameter which satisfac- torily correlated the static and dynamic flow coefficients was found. 820155. Jet Air Suction Port (JASP) improves fuel consumption of 4-stroke cycle gasoline engines at idle. Naoki Okanishi, Itaru Fukutani, and Eiichi Watanabe, The Institute of Vocational Training (Japan). On 4-stroke cycle engines, the authors reported that under certain conditions the cylinder pressure, measured during the suction stroke with a low-pressure pickup, dropped below the critical pressure. Noting this considerable negative cylinder pressure during the suction stroke, the authors devised a Jet Air Suction Port (JASP), which was opened and closed by piston movement near bottom dead center. As a result, it was possible not only to burn lean mixtures steadily, but also to decrease the fuel con- sumption 10 to 30% at idle by the jet air flow generated automatically from the JASP. Reductions in THC, CO and NO at idle were also noted. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820156. Cylinder cutoff of 4-stroke cycle engines at part-load and idle. Eiichi Watanabe and Itaru Fukutani, The Institute of Vocational Training (Japan). In order to improve fuel consumption, the effects of cylinder cutoff on engine performance were investigated on a 4-stroke cycle in-line 6-cylinder gasoline engine. It was found that the cylinder cutoff obtained by deactivating both the inlet and exhaust valves was very effective for reducing the fuel consumption at part-load and idle, as both the pumping power for the inlet and the power for activating the inlet and exhaust valves were noticeably decreased. 820157. Recent developments in swirl induced turbulent mixing for 4-stroke cycle engines. Rodney D. Hugelman, Dept. of General Engrg., Univ. of 42</page><page sequence="24">Illinois, Urbana, IL.; and Siak-Hoo Ong, SEKON International, Santa Monica, CA. To meet both environmental standards and improved fuel economy emphasis is being stressed on lean-burn tech- nology. An important goal of that technology is to improve the homogeneity of the fuel/gas charge. Swirl flow has been suggested as a possible solution. However, the stable nature of single vortex swirl has not provided the desired mixing but rather tends toward stratification. Blade induced swirl systems are examined and shown to be very effective when multi-swirl vortices of counter- rotation are produced. With net zero angular momentum these vortices merge rapidly and self-destruct with intense mixing. Since multi-swirl mixing can have near zero residual swirl high heat transfer losses are also minimized. Experimental lean-burn limits approach 22 to 1 A/F ratio. 820158. Delivery ratio changes with branched inlet systems attached to a two-stroke cycle engine. E. Egusquiza and L. Virto, Department of Fluid Mechanics, University Polytechnic of Barcelona at Terrassa, Spain. This paper describes the changes produced in the delivery ratio-engine speed characteristics due to the inclusion of a side branch pipe in the inlet pipe of a motored two-stroke cycle engine with piston controlled air intake. The optimum length of the branch pipe to increase the delivery ratio at every engine speed from 2000 to 6000 rpm is determined experimentally. A computer program based on the method of char- acteristics has been developed to simulate the gas dynamic process in the engine, but it is not described at this stage and is left for precise description at a later date and publication. 820159. The Ogura-Wankel compressor - application of Wankel rotary concept as automotive air condi- tioning compressor. Ichiro Ogura, Ogura Clutch Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). A rotary compressor for automotive air conditioners has long been sought to replace the conventional piston compressor. Reciprocating pistons create vibration and noise, that are usually sensed by vehicle passengers. Noise reduction by elimination of the reciprocating motion of the compressor contributes to passenger comfort and more efficient use of engine horsepower. Today, there are two major types of rotary com- pressors being used in the automotive market-rotary vane compressors and Ogura-Wankel compressors. The Ogura-Wankel has only recently been introduced to the market. This paper tries to examine the application of the Wankel Rotary concept as an automotive air conditioner compressor. 820160. Development of the Liteflex^ suspension leaf spring. Bruce E. Kirkham, Leo S. Sullivan, and Robert E. Bauerle, Inland Div., GMC. Emphasis on vehicle weight reduction in 1977 justified taking a new look at composite springs. 820164 Many reinforcement and matrix resin materials were considered before the combination of fiberglass and epoxy in a filament winding process was selected. Prior to introduction on the first production appli- cation, three and one-half years of testing were conducted accumulating 58 million laboratory fatigue cycles and over five million vehicle test kilometers. The 3.6 Kg composite spring replaced an 18.6 Kg ten leaf steel spring. In addition to mass savings, the Liteflextm composite spring offers the potential for improvement in durability, ride, isolation and packaging. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820161. The "Marsh Mellow" spring.

The approximate population of passenger cars in service and the rate of attrition of that population must be known when long range production plans are made, marketing strategies are developed, the total fuel need of the vehicles on U.S. roads is estimated, etc. Estimation of population is complex due to the lack of accurate data and the interactions between the parameters affecting attrition. Various methods are available to estimate the present and future population levels of 43</page><page sequence="25">820164 passenger cars in service. Within the scope of this paper the projected populations of various passenger cars are compared and various attrition projection methods are discussed. 820165. The effect of combustion chamber shape on the rate of combustion in a spark ignition engine. G. G. Lucas and M. F. J. Brunt, University of Technology, Loughborough, Leicestershire. Measurements have been made of the rate of flame propagation, the cylinder pressure and the combustion rate for twenty one spark ignition engine combustion chamber designs. These show that, for a given compres- sion ratio, the flame speed is not significantly affected by chamber design. However, the rate of combustion, the pressure history and cyclic dispersion are greatly affected. A computer simulation has been developed which uses a simple but effective integration technique to determine the combustion chamber geometric parameters. This, too, shows that combustion chamber design has a marked effect on combustion rate and that the effect is due to the degree of compactness of the chamber. The paper includes also work on spark plug position and dual spark plugs. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820166. Gasoline engine combustion - the high ratio compact chamber. R. H. Thring and M. T. Overington, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. The use of high ratio compact combustion chambers in gasoline engines has been investigated. The objectives of the research are improved fuel economy within a given set of exhaust emission constraints. The effects of a number of parameters such as swirl, compression ratio and combustion chamber geometry have been investigated, and the conclusions are that for Europe, 13:1 compression ratio is feasible and should yield 10% better fuel economy in passenger cars, while for the USA and Japan, 11:1 compression ratio is preferable, and should yield about 5% better fuel economy. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820167. Engine transmission matching to improve pas- senger car fuel economy. R. H. Thring, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. A compact passenger car was modified to allow operation with up to six manual gear ratios and up to 35.4 mile/h per 1000 rev/min. Fuel consumption tests were carried out at steady state conditions, over the U.S. Federal urban drive cycle and on the road. Fuel economy improvements of up to 24% were achieved on the road, and up to 25% on the chassis dynamometer over the urban cycle, confirming computer predictions. 820170.

Albert M. Lipusch, Robert A. Shipp, and B. A. Zatarski, General Motors Inc. Motor vehicle theft has become a low-risk, high-profit crime.

A low emission combustor for an automotive gas turbine. Walter Cornelius, L. William Huell- mantel, and James G. Matson, Fluid Dynamics Department, General Motors Research Labo- ratories, Warren, MI. A low emission, variable-geometry, lean, prevaporizing- premixing combustor is described that was developed at the General Motors Research Laboratories for automotive gas turbine application. The basic design that was conceived especially to minimize the emissions of oxides of nitrogen and the designs and operations of the major combustor components are discussed. Also, an automatic engine control system which was adapted to optimize the low emission performance of the combustor as installed in a regenerative gas turbine is described. Test results of a vehicular installation of this system show that, at low mileage it met all current Federal Emission Standards including the Research Goal of 0.41 g/mi for emissions of oxides of nitrogen. Engine durability remains to be proven. SA E Trans., Vol . 91 820177. (P-105) Design and performance of bipolar, flowing electrolye zinc-bromine batteries for electric vehicles. P. A. Malachesky, R. J. Bel- lows, H. Einstein, P. Grimes, E. Kantner, K. Newby, and A. Young, Exxon Research and Engineering Co., Linden, NJ. Design studies carried out on 20-30 kWh zinc-bromine electric vehicle battery systems project energy densities of 65-70 Wh/kg and 80-85 Wh/1. Zinc bromine concen- tration and zinc electrode loading are the key variables which determine energy density. Power density, projected to be 90-100 W/kg, is primarily a function of electrolyte conductivity, since cell polarization studies show very little concentration or activation polarization. A four cell Zn-Br2 stack (250 Wh) has been tested under the SAE J227aD driving schedule as negotiated by the DOE/GE/Chrysler electric vehicle (ETV-1). Test data indicate the need for conductivity additives to the electrolyte to achieve the necessary power densities. Using KCl and other conductivity additives, vehicle ranges of 95-100 miles can be projected with the use of regenerative braking. Charge acceptance during regenerative braking is very good (-100%) and results in an improvement in vehicle range of 25%. 820178. (P-105) Peak-power characteristics of improved electric-vehicle batteries. D. Corp, E. Berrill, D. Fredrickson, R. Hogrefe, L. Singer, C. Webster, C. Christianson, F. Hornstra, and N. P. Yao, Argonne National Laboratory, Chemical En- gineering Div., Argonne, IL. The technique used for measuring peak power available from a battery during a discharge sustained for a limited duration of time is developed and presented. In tests performed on nickel/iron, nickel/zinc, and lead-acid 820181 electric-vehicle batteries at the National Battery Test Laboratory, it was shown that available peak power decreases with increasing depth-of-discharge (DOD). Most batteries tested deliver between 70 W/kg and 130 W/kg at 50% DOD but produce these peak powers with currents on the order of 700 A - a current well above the capability of most state-of-the-art electric-vehicle pro- pulsion systems. 820179. (P-105) Effects of pulsed-current discharge waveforms on lead-acid traction cell performance. W. H. DeLuca, A. F. Tummillo, F. Hornstra, C. C. Christianson, and N. P. Yao, Argonne National Laboratory, Chemical Engineering Div., Argonne, IL. Chopper-type controllers commonly used in electric vehicle propulsion systems impose pulsed-current dis- charge conditions on the battery that influence both its internal power losses and available energy. In order to optimize propulsion system design, those discharge pa- rameters that affect battery performance must be under- stood and characterized. In a series of tests performed on Exide EV-106 and EE-IV lead-acid traction batteries, a range of operating values were examined for current pulse frequency, average current discharge rate and pulse- to-average current level ratio. For each test, one param- eter was selected as the variable while the other two parameters were maintained at fixed levels. Constant- current discharges were periodically performed during each test to relate battery performance for equivalent pulsed and constant current discharge conditions. The results show that battery performance was independent of current pulse frequency and battery internal power losses varied directly with both the average current discharge rate and the pulse-to-average current ratio. The amp-hour capacity obtained with pulsed-current discharges was greater than that obtained with equivalent constant- current discharges due to the increase in battery temper- ature produced by the higher pulsed-current internal power losses. However, with pulsed-current discharging, battery output power and available energy were always less than that obtained with equivalent constant-current discharging. 820181. (P-107) Characterization of particulate emission from swirl chamber type light-duty diesel engine as a function of engine parameters. Koji Kage- yama and Nobuaki Kinehara, Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Hiroshima, Japan). The diesel engine particulate that was measured by the U.S. certification test method was known to comprise the dry soot and the soluble organic fraction. The objective of this paper was to clarify how a variety of engine parameters effected the emission each of dry soot and soluble organic fraction and, in turn, the total particulate emission level, thus to make a contribution to studies on particulate reduction. In this paper were shown meas- urements of dry soot and soluble organic fraction in the particulate emitted from a Mazda 2.2 liter swirl chamber 45</page><page sequence="27">820181 type diesel engine operated at steady state condition with various engine parameters.

(P-107) Sampling diesel engine particle and artifacts from nitrogen oxide interactions. Ronald L. Bradow, Roy B. Zweidinger, and Frank M. Black, Environmental Protection Agency, En- vironmental Sciences Research Lab.; and Harry M. Dietzmann, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX. The possibility that N02 artifactually converts polynu- clear aromatic hydrocarbons to biologically active species in diesel particle sampling is explored. N02 was injected into dilution air upstream of the exhaust mixing point at varying concentration levels with both passenger car and truck driving simulations. Ames test specific activity and nitropyrene levels were seen to increase above base levels when the N02 level exceeded 5 to 10 ppm. Extract responses to added N02 in transient driving appeared to initially increase, then level off above about 20 ppm. It is suggested that some requestering of nitratable organics may be responsible. Reexposure of filtered particles to diluted gas phase diesel exhaust caused little increase in nitroaromatics or Ames activity. It appears that N02 levels below about 5 ppm are relatively safe from filter artifacts. 820183. (P-107) Alumina coated metal wool as a partic- ulate filter for diesel powered vehicles. M. A. McMahon, C. H. Faist, K. S. Virk, and W. T. Tierney, Texaco Inc., Beacon Research Labs., Beacon, NY. Filters which employ alumina-coated steel wool as the matrix offer a promising means for removing soot particles from diesel exhaust. The performance of diesel exhaust filters (DEF's), which consist of two alumina coated stainless-steel-wool filled cartridges inserted into an outer housing, will be discussed. In this type of filter, the collection efficiency and back-pressure are determined by the metal wool packing density, alumina coating thickness and the physical dimensions of the filter. Combustion of the trapped soot is the most feasible method for regenerating the DEF. A catalytic torch has thus been employed to heat exhaust to temperatures required for regeneration. With this torch in line with the DEF, hydrocarbons injected into the exhaust are cata- lytically oxidized and the exothermic heat used to heat the exhaust. A catalytic torch has been used to regenerate filters many times at 150 to 200 mile intervals during durability tests. 820184. (P-107) Catalytic control of diesel particulate. Bernard E. Enga, Miles F. Buchman, and Ivan E. Lichtenstein, Johnson Matthey, Inc. Concern over particulate emissions from underground diesel engines initiated research into catalytic control of diesel exhaust in the early 1970's. Fundamental laboratory investigations established the novel concept that suitable surface catalysis could initiate ignition of trapped partic- ulate below the thermal ignition temperature. Catalyst compatible filter structures were developed and evaluated on bench engines and by engine users. The later need for a compact, mass producible system to meet future automotive requirements lead to the development of a road going catalytic trap system. The parameters that affect catalytic particulate control are quantified. Ancillary control and operating systems required are discussed together with details of test data and durability experience obtained on bench tests and road going test fleets.

(SP-508) Precious metal demand for automotive catalysts versus availability from scrapped vehi- cles. Joseph E. Hunter, General Motors Re- search Labs., Warren, MI. Estimates were made of the annual demand for precious metal in automotive catalysts and the return from scrapped vehicles from 1975-1995 for the United States plus Canada. Results show that expected scrap returns are currently small; however, by the late 1980's nearly half the yearly precious metal demand in automotive catalysts could be obtained from scrapped vehicles. Estimates also show that continued use of rhodium at current levels for the three-way catalyst will require mining and refining substantial extra platinum group metals for the rhodium content. Precious metal costs for catalysts will therefore be influenced strongly by the overall effectiveness of a recycle system and the amount of rhodium required for NO, control. 820187. (SP-508) Noble metal recovery from spent automotive catalysts. Michael J. D' Aniello, Jr., Physical Chemistry Dept., General Motors Re- search Labs., Warren, MI. This paper consists of two principle parts. In Part I, the known processes for the recovery of noble metals from supported catalysts are reviewed. Part II of this paper details the development and application, on a laboratory scale, of a platinum and palladium recovery process based 46</page><page sequence="28">on a solution extraction process. Several variables for the solution extraction process were evaluated. These vari- ables included choice of oxidant, extraction time and temperature, physical state of the catalyst pellets, and potential pretreatment steps. The best recovery of both platinum and palladium was obtained by extraction with 1-5% (v/v) nitric acid in 6 M hydrochloric acid yielding platinum and palladium recoveries of 85-95% and 89- 99%, respectively, for a series of used catalysts with varying accumulated mileages.

This paper examines the feasibility of using eigenvalue modification as the effective algorithm for interactive modal analysis. The dynamic characteristics of a canti- lever beam are determined experimentally and compared to the results of an analytical study. The model is then modified with the addition of mass and stiffness. The results predicted using eigenvalue modification theory on the analytical model compare very favorably with exper- imentally determined results. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820192.

This paper discusses the design criteria and architecture for a multi-channel FFT proc- essor, and shows how processing up to sixteen parallel input signals can reduce measurement time by an order of magnitude. An example is given which shows the practical value of this increased efficiency. 820198 820193. Dual input estimation of frequency response functions for automotive structures. R. J. Allemang, R. W. Rost, and D. L. Brown, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engrg., University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH. The accurate measurement of the frequency response function is vital to the estimation of the system modal parameters. The use of the single input/output theory to formulate the equations for the frequency response function can be replaced by an equivalent theory involving multiple inputs. The results of this approach provide frequency response functions that are comparable to the single input/output case but with a reduction in the time required per measurement and an increase in the consistency of modal frequency and damping values estimated from different frequency response functions. Examples are included for representative automotive structures. 820194. A multi-input modal estimation algorithm for mini-computers. Harvard Void, John Kundrat, G. Thomas Rocklin, and Richard Russell, Structural Dynamics Research Corp. This paper describes a modal parameter estimation algorithm that uses frequency response functions relative to several exciter locations in a simultaneous manner. Phase information between the exciter locations is used to separate close or multiple roots, and consistent estimates are given for modal parameters and eigenvectors. An experimental investigation of a structure with repeated roots is described. In the single exciter location case, this method reduces to the least squares complex exponential technique.

This paper incorporates old and new ideas into an accepted SAE standard that describes how a laminated paperboard may be bent 180° without a fracture ap- pearing on the surface of the board. Minimal tooling cost, short lead time and low part price can also be achieved by the proper design and manufacture of a scored softboard part in place of a matched metal die designed luggage liner. 820200. SAE classification system for fiberboards. J. M. McCallum, Body Engineering, Ford Motor Co.; and D. S. Brown, Specialty Paperboard Div., Boise Cascade Corp. The SAE Fiberboard Subcommittee has established a classification system for Fiberboards which are utilized in automotive trim products. This new classification system, designated as SAE J 1323, is the result of a joint effort of consumers and suppliers over a period of approximately 10 years to provide a system to select a particular fiberboard and the fiberboard properties for utilization in a particular application in an automotive vehicle. 820201. (SP-511) Magnetic methods of sensing shielded part motion. J. D. Rickman, Jr., RCA Auto- mated Systems, Burlington, MA. A commercially available magnetic reluctance sensor is used to determine the angular velocity of turbocharger impeller blades from outside the aluminum housing. Eddy currents are induced in the aluminum blades by blade motion through the magnetic field projected by an externally mounted Samarium-Cobalt permanent magnet. Test results show that a circuit designed to track the blade signal gives an analog voltage output proportional to the frequency of blade passage over the operating range of the Cummins VT-903 and Detroit 8V-71T turbocharged diesel engines. Cam shaft rotational frequency is measured on Cummins and Detroit deisel engines by sensing the motion of ferromagnetic rocker arm parts through a conducting and possibly ferromagnetic valve cover shield. A strong rare earth Samarium-Cobalt magnet and a wire sensing coil are placed outside the valve cover above the rocker arm. Changing magnetic flux induces a voltage in the coil that is filtered and shaped to give a pulse train output at the frequency of the rocker arm. SAE Trans ., Vol. 91 820202. (SP-511) Fast-acting electromagnetic actuators - computer model development and verification. J. P. Karidis and S. R. Turns, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State Univ. A computer model of fast-acting electromagnetic actu- ators has been developed which accounts for magnetic saturation, flux leakage, eddy currents, squeeze-film fluid damping with inertia effects, and the dynamic coupling of the actuator state variables. The governing equations for each actuator subsystem are developed and solved as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations using Gear's method. This model maintains the simplicity of a lumped-parameter approach and relies on a minimum of empiricism. The model was verified at various levels of system complexity. Predicted steady-state magnet forces showed very good agreement with experimental results over a range of magnetomotive forces from 50 to 900 amp-turns and with gap lengths from 25 to 1000 microns. In addition, the model predicts transient actuator behav- ior and the proper dynamic coupling between the electrical, magnetic, mechanical and fluid subsystems. Experimental and predicted results for armature motion in air, hexadecane and glycerine show excellent trend-wise agreement and demonstrate the necessity of the inclusion of fluid inertia in the squeeze-film analysis.

(SP-51 1) Noncontact miniature torque sensor for automotive application. William J. Fleming and Paul W. Wood, General Motors Research Lab- oratories, Warren, MI. A noncontact torque sensor has been developed for use in engine control systems. The sensor detects torque-induced changes in magnetic properties of the engine crankshaft. A miniature version of the sensor, mounted on a 1980 Chevrolet V-6 engine, is described. Sensor installation requires 22 mm of crankshaft space and a 1.0 mm air gap between sensor and crankshaft is utilized. For a variation of engine torque from -100 to 240 N • m, the sensor generates a linear signal which varies from -25 to 60 mV ; amplification is used to provide an output signal of -500 to 1200 mV. A signal processor associated with the sensor is calibrated to give a torque sensitivity of 5 mV/N • m and it also includes an active filter with a low-pass cutoff frequency of 5 Hz. In its present state of development, torque meas- urement accuracy of the sensor is limited to approxi- mately ± 10 percent due to interfering effects of temper- ature, air gap variation, and engine speed sensitivity. Further investigation will be necessary to establish the ultimate performance potential of the sensor. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820207. (SP-51 1) Digital analyzer for internal combustion engines. C. K.

Gunneson, Revlon, Inc., Edison, NJ. Most quality professionals are thoroughly familiar with the theory and practice of quality costs, yet many have not been able to implement a truly effective cost of quality program. This paper will deal with the day-to-day trials and tribulations of putting in a cost of quality system. The paper will discuss the research which is necessary before a program is conceived; the information and presentation required to sell the concept; and the introductions which must be conducted with subordinates, peers and superiors. The paper will discuss the reactions which can be expected as the presentations are made; the questions which are likely to be asked; and the most appropriate answers to provide. 820209. (SP-51 2) Measuring the cost of product quality. Jack W. Schmidt and Jerry F. Jackson, Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of General Motors 820213 Corp. A number of steps have recently been taken to measure the cost of product quality at Detroit Diesel Allison. These steps and the concept of setting goals to effect improved product quality and productivity are discussed. The paper expands the basic "cost of unquality" model presented in the "DDA 14-Point Quality Improvement Program" to demonstrate the methodology established to quantify the cost savings which result from quality improvement programs.

Bhuyan, Fisher Body Div., General Motors Corp. The two broad aspects of quality are "Quality of Design" and "Quality of Conformance". Therefore, the total cost of product quality is the sum of the costs associated with design quality and conformance quality. This conform- ance quality cost is also referred to as "Quality Cost in Manufacturing". The paper examines the optimum qual- ity cost in manufacturing and its impact on productivity. 820212. (SP-512) Quality costs and supplier quality. Paul C. Fortlage, Allis-Chalmers Corp. Using the popular categories of quality costs: prevention, appraisal, internal failure and external failure, the quality cost elements of a Supplier Quality Assurance program are defined. Several methods of using these costs to measure both the effectiveness of a Supplier Quality Assurance program and the performance of suppliers are discussed. These measurements include the relationship between investment and results, purchasing's cost recovery per- formance, loss of productivity due to purchased defects, percent defective purchased dollars and True Price Index. 820213. (SP-512) The cost of quality - the consumer's perspective. H. J. Bajaría, Multiface, Inc. Consumers are interested in better quality at a given price or similar quality at a lower price. Likewise, most industries and businesses are interested in competing on that basis in the market place. In order to compete successfully however, businesses must apply those meth- ods, procedures and concepts that produce desired results. The author reviews the areas of deficiency in existing business practices in achieving this goal and offers suggestions toward improvement. 49</page><page sequence="31">820217 820217. Design and use of the CRREL instrumented vehicle for cold regions mobility measurements. George L. Blaisdell, U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory. The U.S. Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory has recently acquired an instrumented vehicle for the measurement of forces at the tire/surface material interface. The CRREL instrumented vehicle (CIV) is equipped with moment-compensated triaxial load cells mounted in the front wheel assemblies. Forces are measured in the vertical, longitudinal (in the direction of motion) and side directions. In addition, accurate wheel and vehicle speeds and rear axle torque and speed are measured. Modifications to the vehicle to facilitate the per- formance of traction and motion resistance tests include four lock-out type hubs to allow front-, rear- or four-wheel drive and a dual brake system for front-, rear- or four-wheel braking. A mini-computer-based data acqui- sition system is installed in the vehicle to control data collection and for data processing, analysis, and display. Discussion of the vehicle includes its operation and use for the evaluation of the tire performance and surface material properties of motion resistance and traction. 820218.

Improvements in dimensional stability of poly- urethane automotive fascia through glass fiber reinforcement. R. P. Taylor, M. E. Cekoric, and W. A. Ludwico, Mobay Chemical Corp. Significant improvements in dimensional stability of RIM urethane fascia materials can be achieved by reinforce- ment with milled glass fibers. This paper documents the effects of variations of part thickness and glass content on key properties related to dimensional stability. Proper combinations of base fascia material, glass content, and selective thickening of long unsupported sections can significantly improve the fit and appearance of auto- motive fascia and bumper cover parts, and still maintain their weight savings and damage resistance. 820222.

Allen, Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. If the domestic automotive industry is to regain its dominant position in the North American market, quality and cost must be recognized as the keystones on which the industry must establish a new foundation.

Nondestructive inspection for quality assurance of fiber reinforced plastic assemblies. Gilbert B. Chapmann, II, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Company, Detroit, MI. The quality assurance of fiber reinforced plastic assem- blies is accomplished at several Ford company and supplier facilities by the implementation of inspection technology developed to assure the integrity of adhesive bond joints and the adherend material of which the assemblies are made. A low-frequency ultrasonic inspection method for the 50</page><page sequence="32">adhesive joints has been developed into a production- compatible method and was reported in references 1, 2, and 3. It uses a 25 kHz commercially available bond tester calibrated with reference specimens selected by a statis- tical procedure. Certain strength-related characteristics of the adherend material of the assembly, such as fiber orientation, can also be evaluated by measuring changes in the Lamb-wave velocity of 25 kHz acoustic waves propagated in the material by the bond tester. Glass concentration can be determined nondestructively by measuring the velocity of longitudinal ultrasonic waves propagated through the thickness of the material. The development and implementation of this inspec- tion technology has provided an effective NDI method for determining the tensile strength of the material, in a given direction, by indicating such strength-related properties as glass fiber concentration and orientation.

Although applications of powdered metal processes have not achieved projections made in the early 1970's, recent progress contributing to cost reduction and innovative technology for the mass production industries is encour- aging. Future progress in the Automobile Industry depends on suppliers seizing the opportunities created by market and regulatory forces. Aggressive management within both the supplier and user industries will assure the introduction of innovative technology on a timely basis, if long term profitability is emphasized. 820229. Developments in sintered piston and sealing rings. P. Smith and M. S. Lane, Brico Engineering Limited. Sintered metal alloys have been used to supply the major proportion of the European requirement for shock absorber sealing rings in recent years, and the inherent self lubricating properties conferred by oil retaining surface porosity has proved to be most beneficial. Sintered sealing ring usage extends into other fields including automatic transmission systems and hydraulics. Production of sintered rings has been developed at 820231 Brico to enable such features as chamfers and steps to be incorporated without secondary machining operations. In the field of piston rings, a large number of small non-automotive engines such as lawn mowers, chain saws and outboard marine engines have used sintered alloys for many years, and the powder metallurgy process has proved to be very competitive. Where scuff resistance is a major factor, sintered rings perform well due to their oil retaining surface. This has naturally extended to auto- motive applications where sintered materials have worked well in many volume production motor cars. This paper discusses recent advances in sintered piston and sealing rings aimed at producing alloys which perform at least as well if not better than the accepted wrought materials used at present in such applications as:- Compression rings in automotive internal combustion engines to replace hard chromium plated or molybdenum sprayed peripheral layers; Sealing rings in high duty shock absorbers where both high piston speeds and high side loading can cause scuffing and frictional problems with conventional materials; Sealing rings for both hot and cold ends of Turbocharger turbine shafts, where the powder metallurgy route can offer the benefit of effective lubrication by the addition of a solid lubricant to the matrix of the alloy during manufacture. This is of major importance in the case of the hot end ring which can run under very dry conditions due to high service tempe- ratures. 820230. Effect of atmosphere composition on physical properties in high temperature ferrous sintering. Daniel M. Buck and A. Thomas Sibley, Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., Allentown, PA. Endothermic gas is not an effective protective atmosphere for ferrous sintering at 2350° F. But, strong parts of medium to high carbon content are produced by sintering in a nitrogen-based atmosphere at 2350° F. This nitrogen- based atmosphere must contain a small amount of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. A low level of hydrogen will minimize decarburization of the parts and promote a higher degree of sintering. The carbon monoxide pro- motes a uniform carbon structure. The use of methane to control carbon potential is difficult due to the high carburizing rate of methane at 2350° F which causes recarburization of the parts. Small amounts of Cu or Ni can be added to ferrous powder to further improve the strength of the sintered parts. These elements also tend to stabilize the carbon in the parts and allow small amounts of methane to be added to the atmosphere to further improve the strength of the material without producing recarb.

The internal combustion engine continues to make increasing demands on the valve seat insert as power outputs are increased, the use of alternative fuels prolif- erated and better fuel economy sought. These demands are being met by the latest developments in sintered powder metal valve seat insert materials and design. The developments described are: the incorporation of a high temperature solid lubricant into a heat and wear resistant sintered alloy steel which is particularly effective in dry running environments; a cobalt free, cost conscious high speed tool steel based sintered alloy possessing excellent thermal conductivity for use in arduous applications including the new alternative fuels (natural gas, L.P.G. etc.) and a design of sintered valve seat insert for use in the inlet position which induces a swirl action into the ingoing fuel/air mixture leading to improved fuel econ- omy.

(P-106) Effect of fuel composition on diesel engine noise and performance. D. Anderton, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, The Univ. of Southampton, UK.; and P. E. Waters, Dept. of Transport, London, UK. There is concern in Europe and elsewhere that present fuel quality for diesel engined road vehicles cannot be maintained with changing patterns of demand and utilisation of crude oil. In particular, the oil industry (in the UK) has asked for a reduction of the present British Standard of 50 cetane number minimum for such fuels. Eleven diesel fuels with cetane number ranging from 26 to 58 and made from blends of gas oils refined from crudes from the Middle East, North Sea and West Africa were selected for test. The effect of these on noise and performance has been determined for three representative engines, IDI, DI and turbocharged DI. The test results show that the relationships between the various engine parameters measured and the basic fuel properties such as cetane number and specific gravity are not simple. Cetane number appears only to be valid when comparing fuels of similar chemical composition or at the same air temperature. Overall activation energy is ten- tatively suggested as a substitute for cetane number. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820236. (P-106) Diesel engine combustion noise with alternative fuels. C. M. P. Chan, I. D. Moncrieff, and R. A. Pettitt, Perkins Engines Ltd., East- field, Peterborough (England). The paper outlines the method Perkins use to determine the combustion noise of a diesel engine. Using this method a relationship between the Cetane Number of diesel gas oil and the combustion noise was established for a Perkins 3.86 litre diesel engine. The combustion induced mechanical noise of an engine, with different fuel Cetane Numbers, was also investigated. The combustion noise obtained with various alternative fuels, including vege- table oils, is also documented. The differences in the fuel parameters and the associated combustion noise are discussed.

Herrick Lab., School of Mechanical Engrg., Purdue Univ., West Lafay- ette, IN. This paper reviews some previous findings about the combustion noise of diesel engines and compares them with the authors' findings. The reason why the noise of most turbocharged diesel engines is more sensitive to speed than load is explained. The findings of this research suggest that the frequency content of the combustion gas pressure up to about 300 Hz is related to the maximum cylinder pressure, Pmax. Between about 300 Hz and 2 kHz it is related to the maximum rate of cylinder pressure rise Pmax and above about 2 kHz it is related to both the magnitude and the duration of the second derivative of the cylinder pressure P. Pmax is more sensitive to load than speed. No correlation was found between Pmax and engine speed or load. The variation in the magnitude of P is thought to be a random process, but the frequencies of the cylinder pressure fluctuations are closely related to the cavity resonance frequencies. For the engine under the same running condition, cases with higher values of Pmax and P result in a higher engine noise level. 820238. (P-106) Diesel engine noise: control at source. M. F. Russell, Lucas CAV Limited. If the noise generating mechanisms inherent in a diesel engine design are analysed thoroughly, several alternatives 52</page><page sequence="34">for controlling the noise at source become apparent. Research has shown that there are several ways of modifying an engine structure to reduce the noise radiated by the external surfaces of the engine in response to combustion and mechanical forces developed within the engine. A combination of structural improvements and fairly modest reductions in the excitation, by incorpo- rating a smoother combustion process and by minimising mechanical impacts between the working parts of the engine, could result in reductions in truck engine noise of up to 10 dB(A). 820240. (P-106) Piston slap noise reduction in a Vee- block diesel engine. R. G. DeJong and N. E. Parsons, Cambridge Collaborative, Inc., Cam- bridge, MA. The noise generated by piston slap in a 6V engine has been measured and modeled analytically using a mobility analysis. The mounting of the cylinder liner in the block has been determined to be an important parameter in controlling piston slap noise in this engine. A method of mounting the liner was developed which reduces the transmission of vibration to the engine block while maintaining the required sealing of the combustion chamber. A prototype engine has been constructed which incorporates this design and the overall noise reduction has been evaluated. The reduction of piston slap noise by this method has been found to be as good as that achieved by the use of tight-fit pistons with the standard liners in this engine. 820242. (SP-513) A search for priorities in crash protec- tion. A. C. Malliaris, Ralph Hitchcock, and James Hedlund, National Highway Traffic Safe- ty Administration. This paper presents the methodology and results of an analysis of the available information on motor vehicle safety which could be used to provide a basis for establishing priorities for future Government and private sector efforts directed at enhanced crash protection. The work was stimulated by several factors: (1) 5 years have elapsed since the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) published a plan for motor vehicle safety research and development, (2) motor vehicles have changed substantially over the past several years, (3) the quantity and quality of accident data and vehicle crash performance information have increased dramatically over the past 5 years, and (4) Government policies and the amount of Government and private sector resources available for future efforts are changing. This study takes the agency's automated data files on personal injury as the baseline information on injuries sustained by restrained and unrestrained occupants of all types of vehicles, and by pedestrians and cyclists. This information is analysed according to the magnitude of harm sustained, the potential for reduction in harm, and the relative adequacy of data and methods available for the explo- ration of solutions. The primary parameters used for this analysis are: crash severity, injury severity, injured body 820245 region, and source of injury in the vehicle. Secondary parameters are: car impact direction, occupant seating position, ejection path (if ejected), and restraint use. The human harm is quantified as a cost-weighted sum of the number of people injured or the number of injuries sustained, whether fatal or not. Fatality and fatality reduction estimates are also made. Priorities suggested by these data and analyses are discussed extensively. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820243. (SP-513) Light vehicle frontal impact protection. Daniel S. Cohen, Edward Jettner, and William E. Smith, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This paper addresses the protection of occupants in light vehicles. It presents data and techniques for identifying and measuring potential crashworthiness improvements that would mitigate injuries to occupants striking frontal interior components such as the steering wheel, instrument panel and windshield. Both restrained and unrestrained occupants can be injured by frontal interior components in crashes. The focus of this paper is on the unrestrained occupant. However, performance criteria and associated countermeasures will have to be developed considering the differences in the mechanisms of injury to both the restrained and unrestrained occupants. Work on the restrained occupant and the similarities and differences between both conditions remains to be considered. The paper presents information on the magnitude and types of injuries received from frontal interior components and on how the performance of these components and the vehicle structure affect the resultant injuries. 820244. (SP-513) Light vehicle occupant protection - top and rear structures and interiors. William R. S. Fan and Edward Jettner, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This paper addresses serious, occupant crash injuries from: (a) head impacts with A-pillars, roof headers, and roof side rails, and (b) occupant entrapment and roof intrusion in rollover accidents. It also discusses two less frequent causes of injury: (a) fires in crashes, and (b) occupant ejection through the roof and rear window or rear doors. The paper estimates the relative frequencies of these types of injuries, classified according to the body area injured and the vehicle interior component respon- sible for the injury. Data for these estimates is from the National Crash Severity Study augmented by the 1979 Fatal Accident Reporting System data. Also, this paper addresses the potential for reducing the severity of these injuries in light motor vehicles, with particular emphasis on AIS 3 and more serious injuries. 820245.

Collision related injuries associated with the side of passenger vehicles are a major part of the price of motor 53</page><page sequence="35">820245 vehicle accidents. Three methods for evaluating the crash-related safety characteristics of the sides of motor vehicles are examined. One method uses a full-scale crash test for the evaluation of performance. A second method uses subsystem, or component, tests and the third method relies on analytical procedures for the evaluation.

National Annual Accident Statistics for pedestrians and cyclists are presented along with a breakout of injuries matched with vehicle impact location and other causation factors. Results of full-scale accident simulation tests using surrogates to investigate the relationship between impact response and injury severity for several body regions is presented. Accident investigation data, full-scale accident simulation research test data, and computer modeling data aimed at determining the effects of vehicle front surface structure geometry on pedestrian injury patterns and severity are presented. The general approach to pedestrian injury mitigation through vehicle modifi- cation is discussed. A discussion of motorcyclist injury patterns is also presented. 820247. Occupant kinematics in motor vehicle crashes. Stanley H. Backaitis and Leon DeLarm, The National Highway Traffic Safety Administra- tion.; and D. Hurley Robbins, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. This paper addresses the kinematics of occupants of light motor vehicles that are involved in frontal collisions. Injury to occupants of these vehicles constitute a majority of the harm incurred in all of the traffic accidents. Most injury is caused by the relatively high velocity collisions of occupants into vehicle interior components. A two dimensional (2-D) MVMA dynamic occupant simulation was used to facilitate the understanding of occupant kinematics in frontal collisions in general and to deter- mine the spectra of occupant impact velocities into vehicle components for a range of crash speeds in particular. Real world accident data and laboratory crash tests were used to provide inputs and boundaries for the MVMA 2-D model. The accident data provided guide- lines as to which occupant-to-vehicle impact modes produce the most harm and therefore should be ad- dressed. Parameters investigated for their effect on occupant kinematics include vehicle crash intensity, crash pulse shape and duration, pre-crash braking, occupant size, seat friction, vehicle interior space characteristics, occupant seating distance from vehicle contact points and types of occupant restraints. 820248. Development of a cost-effective spark and fuel control system. Richard V. Abdoo and Ralph D. Furmanek, Electrical and Electronics Div., Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Electronic engine control applications have arisen which require performance and capability in excess of that achievable with the existing Ford low-cost systems, but less than the capacity of an available high-performance system. In response to these needs, a new electronic control unit was developed which meets the increased functional requirements at a system cost lower than the existing low-cost approach. The gain in function/cost ratio is achieved through re-partitioning of the control system, maximum use of standard, high volume parts, process commonality with other products, efficient use of microcomputer capability through increased memory density and optimized software, and several technical innovations. The product resulting from these design efforts constitutes an example of the continuing evaluation of electronics as a cost efficient, powerful engine control method. 820249. A new microcomputer for engine control. Yoshi- yuki Idogawa, Kazuo Funabashi, and Yukio Maehashi, Nippon Electric Co., Ltd. (Kawasaki, Japan). The microcomputer based electronic engine control is aiming to attain much more precise engine control than mechanical or analog-electronic systems. Even this system involves certain problems. The latest advancement of semiconductor technology is quite evident. We have developed a new 8-bit single chip microcomputer, the uPD7811G, based on our latest semiconductor technol- ogy. The outcome of our examination of engine control realized by using the uPD781 1G, particularly its software, are described in this paper. 820250. Development of an optimal automotive control custom microprocessor. Richard C. Breitzman, Electrical and Electronics Division, Ford Motor Company.; and James H. Kerins, Telecom Automotive Military Operations, Intel Corpo- ration. Automotive engine emissions and fuel economy create the requirement for a high speed, accurate control system for maximum performance under harsh environmental con- ditions. Large scale integrated circuit microprocessor technology offers the opportunity to customize electronic control systems for a long product life to meet these challenges. The joint Ford/Intel development of a VLSI single-chip microprocessor with its companion memory chip has been successful in applying this approach to produce such an optimal control system. 820251. An LSI implementation of a low cost ignition controller. James E. Gillberg, Solid State Div., RCA. 54</page><page sequence="36">This paper will discuss the function and implementation of a low cost ignition controller. Rombie (ROM Based Ignition Controller) is a low cost alternative to today's larger electronic systems. Rombie, while designed specif- ically to address a market for inexpensive four cylinder engine controls, is also capable of controlling larger 6 and 8 cylinder engines. We will be investigating both the implementation of a spark advance system using the Rombie controller and actual LSI implementation of that controller. The ROM Based Ignition Controller is a digital system which operates in the time domain to generate a desired spark advance, according to the length of a measured reference interval (inverse of rpm). The system utilizes lists of the time value in ROM or PROM. Eash list corre- sponds to the advance vs rpm relationship for a specific vacuum level. This permits a true two dimensional mapping of spark advance as a function of rpm and vacuum. Rombie is presently implemented in a 2 chip format; a CMOS Control Chip with on board A/D conversion for vacuum, and a standard CMOS ROM. The control chip has been developed using the RCA Automatic Placement and Routing Computer Aided Design System. The capability of computer placement and routing for digital logic circuits allows for quick turnaround of LSI inte- grated circuits. In addition, recent improvements to the APAR design system have further streamlined the design cycle for any LSI integrated circuit. 820253. KE-Jetronic - a new continuously injecting elec- tronically controlled multipoint injection system with limp-home capability. Wolfgang Maisch, Robert Bosch GmbH (West Germany). After a brief explanation of the K-Jetronic injection system, there follows the description of the KE-Jetronic which represents the combination of a basic mechanical installation and the electronic control of additional functions. Special emphasis is placed on the new components such as the air-flow sensor, the electrohydraulic actuator, the pressure regulator and the electronic control unit. Test results show the improvement in fuel economy and in emissions. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820256. A low cost electronic ignition control system with a 4-bit microcontroller. Richard W. Kovener, National Semiconductor Corp. A low cost electronic ignition control system has been developed using a 4-bit microcontroller. The microcon- troller determines the crankshaft position from notches in a disc attached to the crankshaft and provides registration between engine rotation and proper cylinder firing. The controller outputs the proper signals to a special ignition coil and thereby eliminates the need for a conventional distributor. Timer peripherals are used to measure engine speed 820261 and to generate spark timing signals. Other spark timing determining variables are measured by an analog to digital converter. Problems relating to rapid engine acceleration are presented and solutions discussed. 820257. Endurance test of a sunflower oil/diesel fuel blend. M. Ziejewski and K. R. Kaufman, Ag- ricultural Engineering Department, North Da- kota State Univ., Fargo, ND. Two endurance tests were completed on a diesel engine in the Allis Chalmers Engine Division at Harvey, Illinois. The two tests included a 500 hour baseline test with #2 diesel fuel and a 600 hour test with a 50/50 (v/v) blend of alkali refined sunflower oil and #2 diesel fuel. A continuous test cycle of three minutes at high idle and 10 minutes at peak torque was used. There were no significant problems with engine operation during the baseline test. However, problems were experienced while operating on the blended fuel. While using the blended fuel (1) there was abnormal carbon buildup on the injection nozzle tip, (2) the nozzle opening pressure dropped 10-15%, (3) the injection nozzle needles stuck, (4) there was excessive carbon buildup on the intake ports, (5) operation problems of the turbocharger were observed, and (6) piston ring sticking problems were experienced. 820260. Sunflower oil as a fuel extender in direct injection turbocharged diesel engines. Rodica A. Bara- nescu and Joseph J. Lusco, International Har- vester Co. - Engine Engineering. The paper presents the results of a research project to evaluate performance and durability of direct injection turbocharged diesel engines using sunflower oil and blends thereof. Alcaline refined sunflower oil and three different blends of sunflower oil and diesel fuel were comparatively tested against #2 diesel fuel for: physical and chemical characteristics, fuel injection system per- formance, short term engine performance, propensity to nozzle deposits buildup, limited durability operation and low temperature starting capability. Test results are presented for the various phases of the project and correlations between the fuel characteristics and engine acceptability are discussed. 820261. A technical assessment of alcohol fuels. Alternate Fuels Committee of the Engine Manufacturers Association The use of alcohol as fuel for internal combustion engines is developed from a historical perspective to present-day technology. Methods of producing the common fuel alcohols, methanol and ethanol, are discussed together with economic considerations. The properties of alcohol fuels are detailed in comparison with those of petroleum fuels. The charac- teristics which affect health and safety are pointed out. The use of alcohol and alcohol blends in gasoline and diesel engines is examined. Experimental diesel engine modifications to incorporate alcohol combustion with that of diesel fuel are analyzed for various available tech- 55</page><page sequence="37">820261 nologies. These include mechanical emulsification with diesel fuel, fumigation and in-cylinder injection of alcohol. Performance, energy consumption and emissions results are examined as well as safety and engine durability concerns. The development status of ignition-assisted diesels and spark-ignited stratified-charge engines is reported. An extensive bibliography is included. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820262. (P-105) Computer-controlled electric drive train test facility. Michael G. Reynolds, Robert H. Nelson, and Cynthia A. Bronsky, General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. This paper describes the design and operation of a computer controlled road load simulator for the devel- opment of electric vehicle drive trains. Past experience has shown that it is difficult for a driver to execute a driving schedule exactly, cycle after cycle, day after day. Pre- vailing atmospheric conditions affect battery capacity, vehicle drag, and even motor efficiency. It is not reasonable to make judgments about vehicle range when day-to-day variability in testing conditions can cause range performance differences on the same order of magnitude as those noted between different drive systems. These were the reasons for development of the road load simulator. The system consists of a DC dynamometer, digital mini-computer, torque and speed transducers, and any electric vehicle drive train. Complete power trains con- sisting of batteries, motor, choke, controller and chopper can be tested under controlled and repeatable test conditions for simulated vehicles. This can be done not only at steady speeds, but under actual driving cycles (such as EPA Urban or SAE J227a) with the computer acting as the driver. 820263. (P-105) Development and integration tests of a microcomputer controlled hybrid vehicle. Clem- ent B. Somuah and Robert D. King, General Electric Co., Schenectady, NY. This paper describes the hardware and software inte- gration tests of the power train and controller for a hybrid vehicle. The propulsion power is shared between a gasoline engine and a dc shunt motor. The control functions were implemented using a dual Intel 8086 microcomputer system. Dynamometer test results show smooth transitions from one mode of operation to another and comparable performance to conventional gasoline powered automobiles 820264. Trend in vacuum fluorescent displays. Kiyoshi Morimoto and Thomas L. Pykosz, Futaba Corp. Trend in Vacuum Fluorescent Displays relates to the technological advances in the design and construction of VFD's, with emphasis on recent and state of the art technology. Current design criteria plus operation pa- rameters are outlined. Additionally, market demands on the display sector are noted with sections on both the displays of the present and future. 820268. (P-105) The Fiat hybrid bus program. Giampiero Brusaglino, Centro Ricerche Fiat. The development of a hybrid bus has been sponsored by Italian National Research Council. It started in the middle of 1976. The FIAT Research Center was Main Contractor and Leader of a team constituted by other industries and Research Institutes. Two possible solutions in terms of secondary on-board energy source, or buffer unit have been considered: a storage battery and a flywheel. Main objective of these studies was the evaluation of the potential fuel saving. Other objectives for the battery-hybrid version were the possibility of driving in pure electric mode in given areas and recharging of the batteries by external sources of electricity. This presentation will illustrate the recently completed battery-hybrid version program. The solution with flywheel is still under development. 820269. (P-105) Test procedures for hybrids - a review of proposals to date. Victor Wouk, Victor Wouk Associates, New York, NY. The hybrid passenger road vehicle presents a difficult problem when one considers establishing meaningful test procedures for determining performance and energy and fuel consumption characteristics. This is due to the continuum of possibilities of division of use of the energy stores available for propulsion during the drive mission. The continuum, or spectrum, varies from one extreme operation as an all-electric, where no on-board liquid petroleum fuel is used, to the other extreme operation as an all-ICE, where no electricity is used. This paper reviews the background of hybrids and discusses testing to date of some hybrids. Three proposed methods of testing hybrids that have been published or proposed, are examined. The results presented are mainly those determined by IEC TC/69 WG5 "Hybrid Electric Road Vehicles" at a meeting in London on September 17 and 18, 1981. Several components of a test procedure have been approved, but no recommended complete test procedure, even fòr a specific mission, has as yet received anything but tentative approval. 820270. (P-105) Operating experience with electric vans operated by private business and individuals. Jens-Peter Altendorf, Volks wagenwerk AG, Wolfsburg.; Hans Stickel, Studiengesellschaft Nahverkehr mbH, Berlin.; and Reiner Thomas, Gesellschaft für Elektrischen Strassenverkehr, Essen. So far, most of the operating experience with electric vehicles has been gained within large companies or government organizations. Within an electric vehicle demonstration programme initiated by the Bundesminis- ter für Forschung und Technologie, West-Germany, 40 electric VW vans are being operated by small business and 56</page><page sequence="38">private people in West Berlin since August 1980. Most of these vehicles are equipped with an onboard charger and recombinating caps. This results in different operating modes of the vehicles as compared to fleet operated vehicles. In this paper, the mode of operation of these vehicles is described in detail. Test results regarding the vehicle operation, the battery service and battery life are also described and discussed. 820271. (P-105) Comparative EPA fuel economy tests of EVs versus ICE vehicles. J. L. Arias, Arias Research Associates, Inc.; R. R. Carlson, Sys- tems Control, Inc.; and E. A. Ulbrich, Twenty- First Century Electric Vehicles, Inc. Results of road and dynamometer tests to compare the energy consumption of a battery powered electric vehicle and a similar ICE vehicle are reported. Test cycles included the SAE J227aC, EPA, FTP and HFET, the Southern California Edison 3 stop/mile, and a freeway route. Disagreements in the results of dynamometer and road tests, and fuel economy differences due to dyna- mometer calibration method, are noted. Differences in the relative fuel economy of the electric and ICE vehicle as large as 25% are shown by using different test procedures and computational methods. Recommendations for de- veloping a new test procedure are presented which could increase the equivalent fuel economy for EVs and use the standard EPA driving cycles for both types of vehicles. 820272. (P-107) Performance and regeneration charac- teristics of a cellular ceramic diesel particulate trap. Z. N. Mogaka, V. W. Wong, and S. M. Shahed, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. Fundamental aspects of performance and regeneration of a porous ceramic particulate trap are described. Dimen- sionless correlations are giveA for pressure drop vs. flow conditions for clean and loaded traps. An empirical relationship between estimated particulate deposits and a loading parameter that distinguishes pressure drop changes due to flow variations from particulate accu- mulation is presented. Results indicate that trapping efficiencies exceed 90% under most conditions and pressure drop doubles when particulate accumulation occupies only 5% of the available void volume. Regen- eration was achieved primarily by throttling the engine intake air. For various combinations of initial loading level, trap inlet temperature and oxygen concentration, it was found that regeneration rate peaked after 45 seconds from initiation. In most cases, two phases of regeneration were identified: a rapid phase lasting about 90 seconds followed by a slow reaction phase of approximately half an hour during which the residual deposits are incin- erated. A regeneration map showing contours of constant regeneration rate is described. Regeneration paths on this map illustrate regions of slow, rapid, and destructive regenerations.

Radhakrishnan, Sloan Automo- tive Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. A model has been developed for a divided-chamber automotive diesel engine which describes the intake, compression, combustion and expansion, and exhaust processes in sufficient detail to permit calculations of pressure, fuel-air ratio distribution, heat release distri- bution, NO formation, soot mass loading, and soot oxidation processes. The novel feature of this model is the use of a stochastic mixing approach during the combus- tion and expansion processes to describe the nonuniform fuel-air ratio distribution within the engine. In this approach, the fuel-air ratio distribution during the combustion and emissions formation processes can be followed as it evolves with time. Experimental data generated on a single-cylinder divided-chamber diesel engine were used to verify the accuracy of the model predictions. Agreement between experimental data and predicted values of engine performance and NOx emis- sions levels was good. The model is used to examine the origin of NO and soot emissions in a divided-chamber diesel engine. The cycle-simulation results show that NO forms primarily in the pre-chamber. The soot studies show that soot oxidation occurs in the pre- and main-chambers, and soot oxidation mechanism is both kinetically and mixing limited. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820274. (P-107) Divided-chamber diesel engine, part II: experimental validation of a predictive cycle- simulation and heat release analysis. Raja T. Kort, S. Hossein Mansouri, John B. Heywood, and Agop Ekchian, Sloan Automotive Labo- ratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. In this study, a set of performance and emissions data, obtained from a single-cylinder divided-chamber auto- motive diesel engine over the normal engine operating range, is described and analyzed. The data are used to evaluate a computer simulation of the engine's operating cycle, described in a companion paper, which predicts the properties of gases inside the engine cylinder throughout the cycle, and engine efficiency, power and NOx emis- sions. Satisfactory agreement between predictions and measurements is obtained over most of the engine's operating range. The characteristics of the experimental pre- and main-chamber pressure versus crank angle data are then examined in detail. A heat release analysis appropriate for divided-chamber diesel engines is developed and used to obtain heat release rate profiles through the combustion process. A useful method for estimating the heat transfer during combustion from the heat release profile and the heating value of the injected fuel is developed and applied 57</page><page sequence="39">820274 to this data base.

Alkidas, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. High-speed schlieren photography was employed to study air-fuel mixing and combustion in several two-dimen- sional prechambers that represented a 1980 GM-Olds- mobile diesel prechamber and modifications thereof. The experiments were performed in a Rapid Compression Machine. A computational study was also undertaken to model these experiments using a two-dimensional com- puter code. The computational study also considered a Ricardo Comet V swirl chamber, in addition to the above chambers. The computations gave predictions of the full two-dimensional transient flow field during the compres- sion stroke in the absence of injection or combustion. This study showed that the prechamber flow is dominated by the incoming jet. As a result the vortex, which is formed due to the nearly tangential jet entry, initially is confined to part of the chamber and not centered in the chamber. As the inflow velocity falls towards the end of the compression stroke, the vortex tends to center itself, while the vortex structure grows and more nearly fills the chamber. The implications of this flow field development on injected fuel are considered by examining velocities along the injection axis. Excellent agreement between the experiments and computations with respect to the vortex position and overall flow field structure was found. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820276. Comparison of measured and predicted three-way catalyst conversion efficiencies under dynamic air-fuel ratio conditions. M. A. Shulman, D. R. Hamburg, and M. J. Throop, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. Results of three-way catalyst (TWC) conversion efficiency measurements are presented which demonstrate the effects of dynamic operation. In one series of meas- urements, the time-averaged conversion efficiencies were determined for the case in which the TWC was subjected to a series of complex air-fuel ratio (A/F) waveforms. The measured efficiencies are compared to predicted effi- ciencies determined from the superposition of the TWC response to the individual sinusoidal components com- prising the complex waveform. This comparison shows discrepancies for CO in the lean region, and for HC and NOx in the rich region. In a second series of measurements, the instantaneous conversion efficiencies were determined for a square wave A/F waveform using a timed-sampling technique. The results of these measurements illustrate the effects of 02 storage, the enhancement of CO conversion due to the water-gas shift reaction, and the enhancement of NOx conversion during the rich portion of the A/F waveform. The square wave A/F results are used to partially explain the time-averaged results. 820278. Impact of low ambient temperature on diesel passenger car emissions. James N. Braddock, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Mobile Source Emissions Research Branch, Research Triangle Park, NC. Exhaust emissions from two diesel passenger cars were measured as a function of ambient temperature (43 - 82 °F) over the urban dynamometer driving schedule of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP). Low ambient tem- perature did not affect rates of emission of total hydro- carbons, carbon monoxide, or nitrogen oxides. Fuel economy decreased with decreasing test temperature. Total particulate matter increased with decreasing test temperature, as did particulate organic emission rates (due primarily to adsorption of uncombusted diesel fuel). Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon emissions (/xg/ mile) and mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella bioassay (rev/mile) were not affected by decreasing test temper- ature. 820279. Exhaust purification with small 2-stroke engines - a challenge for catalytic systems. E. Koberstein and H. D. Pletka, Degussa AG, ZN Wolfgang. Two-stroke engines used in many different applications show comparatively high exhaust emissions, especially in hydrocarbons. In some countries they contribute con- siderably to the total HC emissions. Test methods and regulations to reduce these emissions have been discussed by European institutions for two-wheeled vehicles with small engines. They are shortly outlined. Systematic investigations of emission patterns for HC, CO, NOx and 02, and temperature distributions over families of torque curves for a 50 cc. engine are presented. The use of small, low cost catalytic systems to reduce these emissions is tested on stationary engines (conver- sions as function of engine modes) and on the roller dynamometer (emissions during the applicable ECE cycle) using commercial fuel (0.15 g Pb/1). The overall efficiency is mainly determined by oxygen concentrations and temperature. 820280. Effects of carbon, phosphorus, and sulfur content on the tensile properties and spot weldability of high-strength cold-rolled sheet. S. R. Goodman and W. F. Domis, United States Steel Corp., Research Laboratory, Monroeville, PA. Low-carbon aluminum-killed rephosphorized steels con- taining 0.06 to 0.11 percent phosphorus have been developed to produce highly formable cold-rolled sheets with minimum yield strengths of 40 ksi, suitable for automobile body-panel formations. In the present study the effects of carbon (0.03 to 0.09%), phosphorus (0.06 to 0.12%), and sulfur (0.01 and 0.025%) on the spot-welding characteristics of rephosphorized cold-rolled-steel sheet with yield strengths ranging from 37 to 50 ksi were investigated. Within the compositional ranges explored, 58</page><page sequence="40">the transition from good weldability (full button pullout in peel and cross-tension tests) to poor weldability (partial button pullout) was primarily related to higher levels of carbon and sulfur. Increasing the phosphorus content from 0.06 to 0.12 percent also decreased spot-weld integrity. 820281. Static and impact strengths of spot-welded HSLA and low carbon steel joints. Kon-Mei W. Ewing, General Motors Technical Center, Warren, MI.; Matthew Cheresh, Effects Technology, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA.; Robert Thompson, Inland Steel Research Labs, East Chicago, IN.; and Paul Kukuchek, Effects Technology, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA. The static and impact load-carrying capability of resis- tance spot-welded HSLA and low carbon steel joints as influenced by loading rates, loading modes and welding schedules are presented. Peak load data at five testing speeds spanning between 1.6 X IO4 km/h (IO4 mph) and 24 km/h (15 mph) for bare (1.5 mm; 0.060" gage) and galvanized (1.4 mm; 0.055" gage), 414 MPa (60 ksi)-yield HSLA steel and bare (1.3 mm; 0.050" gage) and galvanized (1.3 mm; 0.050" gage) low carbon steel showed an increase in maximum load with increasing test velocity. The tensile shear configuration exhibited the highest failure loads of the three joints tested, followed by the cross tension and coach peel joints. Results from under-, nominal-, and over-welded specimens suggested that slight over-welding in the expulsion region of the weld lobe could produce welds with similar, if not higher, loads as nominally- welded joints, whereas under-welding generally reduced the weld load-carrying capability. 820282. Weld associated localized necking in various steels. M. S. Rashid, Metallurgy Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, ML; and A. E. Rathke, Mechanical Engineering Dept., General Motors Institute, Flint, MI. The joining of metals by welding results in unavoidable heating of adjacent material causing the formation of a weld heat affected zone (HAZ). Deformation of the weld zone as during automotive wheel rim fabrication is reported to develop a non-uniform strain distribution in the weld HAZ of high strength steels. This can lead to the formation of a localized neck in the HAZ and hence, a higher production scrap rate in these steels compared to plain carbon steel. This report examines the mechanical property changes that occur in the weld HAZ of three commercial high strength steels and a plain carbon steel. These mechanical property changes are explained in terms of the phase transformations that occur on heating the steels during welding, and the explanations provide insight into poten- tial solutions for reducing the tendency for post-weld, deformation-induced necking during automotive rim fabrication. 820285 820283. Development of NB added ferrite-bainite steels and their automotive application. Shunichi Ha- shimoto, Shoji Kambe, and Masatoshi Sudo, Central Research Lab.; and Yasunori Tsugami, Kakogawa Works, Kobe Steel Ltd. (Japan). The dual-phase steel was expected to have the potential to reduce wheel weight, but has not completely succeeded in doing so, in part, because of localized necking and fracture that occurs when the welded hoop is stretched during the initial flaring and the last rim rolling operation. In order to solve these problems and to develop a new type of steel for wheel, especially for wheel rim, the effect of the nature of low temperature transformation products on the mechanical properties, stretch-flangeability, fatigue strength and flash butt weldability of multi-phase steels has been studied. These studies show that Nb added ferrite-bainite sheet steel is preferred to dual-phase steel in fabrication of wheel rim and disc from the point of view of its lower production scrap rate and its lower cost.

The effects of base metal yield strength, thickness, weld diameter and load ratio on the fatigue strength of spot welds in titanium-bearing HSLA steel have been exam- ined for specimens tested with both tensile shear and cross-tension loading. Weld strength, as measured by the load range, was found to be essentially independent of base metal strength but increased in a complex manner with increasing material thickness or weld diameter and decreased with an increasingly positive load ratio. Equa- tions were developed for estimating fatigue life from material thickness, weld diameter, load range and load ratio. For lives of 5 X 103 to 5 X 106 cycles, a good agreement was obtained between estimated and measured values for both tensile shear and cross-tension loading. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820285. Weldability of a new HSLA plate product. D. W. Dickinson, T. V. Natale, G. D. Ries, J. M. Haser, A. T. Davenport, and D. R. DiMicco, Research Center, Republic Steel Corp. A new high-strength, as-hot-rolled plate product has been developed which attains 80 ksi minimum yield strength without heat treatment. In developing this alloy, one of the main criteria was that it should be weldable. The weldability analyses conducted during the developmental and commercialization stages of this alloy are described. Welding tests were conducted on material from mill trials and included conventional procedure qualifications, implant testing, circular patch testing, Lehigh slot testing, cruciform testing, and controlled thermal severity testing. Based upon the successful results of these laboratory tests, full-scale customer field fabrication trials were conducted. These trials included the construction of a 59</page><page sequence="41">820285 highly restrained grid bed, crane applications, and off-road truck applications as well as other structural applications. All of these welding trials have been successful. 820286. Corrosion test on aluminum alloys adaptable for automobiles (accelerated test). Shigeru Nemoto, Japan Light Metal Association.; and Kazuo Yamada, Mitsubishi Aluminum Co., Ltd. To examine corrosion resistance of aluminum alloys for automobiles, we used accelerated corrosion test, that was 5% salt spray test and alternate immersion test in 5% NaCl solution and 4.7% CaCl2 solution. Aluminum alloys used in these tests were 2036, 5182, 6061, 7016 and AC4C with several finishes. In comparison with aluminum alloys, cold rolled steel sheets, HSLA steel and galvanized steel sheets were used. The results of these tests showed that aluminum alloys generated shallow pitting corrosion and steels generated large amount of corrosion products. The large amount of corrosion in bare steel specimens causes to reduce its tensile strength. In case of weld-bonded (spot-welded) specimens, there developed galvanic and crevice corro- sion, especially galvanic corrosion exhibited on the side of aluminum alloys. We also examined the difference among these test methods. The results of the alternate immersion test in 5% NaCl solution were very similar to 5% salt spray test and the alternate immersion test in CaCl2 solution generated deeper pittings on aluminum specimens than in NaCl solution. 820287. Controlled release of inhibitors for extended protection of aluminum in engine cooling systems. B. E. Cheadle, R. H. Krueger, and J. A. Towers, Borg-Warner Corp. A method of controlled release of inhibitors (CRI) is described, by which inhibitors in a depleting engine coolant can be automatically replenished. A corrodible diaphragm is used to separate an inhibitor reserve from the coolant; inhibitor release is achieved by corrosive rupture of the diaphragm when the coolant becomes depleted. Electrochemical and simulated service tests were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The CRI diaphragm corroded in less depleted coolants than were required to initiate corrosion on 3003, 7072 and cast 355 aluminum. Inhibitor release prevented aluminum cor- rosion in depleted coolants. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820289. Weathering of adhesive bonded aluminum au- tomotive alloys - five year report. T. L. Wilkin- son, Reynold Metals Co. In order to provide durability data on the use of adhesive bonding in automotive applications a comprehensive atmospheric exposure program was instituted in 1974. This program included both adhesive bonded and weld bonded joints. Samples bonded with an epoxy and vinyl plastisol adhesive were exposed at Pompano Beach, Fla., Phoenix, Ariz., Richmond, Va., and Chicago, 111. After five years exposure, better durability was obtained with weld bonded joints than with straight adhesive bonded aluminum joints. The vinyl plastisol adhesive gave better durability when joining aluminum alloys to steel. Better durability was also obtained when metal surfaces were abraded prior to joining. 820290. What is acid rain and how does it affect our environment?E. Eugene Weaver and John W. Shiller, Ford Motor Co. Acid rain in the U.S. is becoming a major environmental issue. This paper reviews the known information regarding pollution sources, impact on the environment and the role of the automobile in acid rain. Although natural sources of sulfur and nitrogen pollutants are equal to or greater than man-made sources on a global scale, many scientists believe man's activities are the major cause of high levels of acidity. Attempts to relate specific sources of S02 to specific acid rain events in the northeastern U.S. have been unsuccessful. The roles of tall stacks, long range transport and dry vs. wet deposition are incompletely understood. Temporal and geographic trends in acidity are not well defined except for increased acidity in the southeast. About 30% of the acidity in rain in the northeast is due to HNO3. In the process of utilizing nitrates as a nutrient, plants partly neutralize the affect of HN03 in the rain. Pollutants, mainly NOx emitted by passenger cars make a small contribution, less than 6%, to acid rain in the northeast. In California the percent is estimated to be less than 19%. These estimates would be smaller if allowance were made for the contribution of natural sources of NOx and SOx. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820293. Past and present acid deposition measurements as a basis for decision making. D. A. Hansen, Environmental Research &amp; Technology, Inc. Analysis of historical precipitation chemistry data shows substantial uncertainty in the pH values derived from them. Consideration of climatological influences on precipitation chemistry suggests that the relatively low acidity inferred for precipitation in large areas of the United States during 1955 to 1956 may have been the result of elevated concentrations of alkaline soil elements. Thus, data from this period may not be suitable for inclusion in any analysis of historical trends in precip- itation acidity due to pollutant emissions. Data from scattered sites operated during the 1920s to 1940s show higher sulfate concentrations and lower nitrate concen- trations than those measured recently at nearby sites. Because of data limitations in terms of continuity of measurements, their spatial coverage, and their quality, no strong case can be made either for or against long term trends in precipitation acidity and its areal extent in the eastern United States. 60</page><page sequence="42">820297. Modified thermoplastic materials (PA, PBTP, PC) for exterior body components. Reinhard K. Riess, Bayer AG, Leverkusen/W.-Germany. Several new thermoplastic materials have been developed, which show promising properties for applications as exterior body parts. These polymers, containing elas- tomeric modifiers and other components, offer products which can be injection molded combining good gasoline resistance and improved low temperature impact per- formance. According to their chemical-physical nature they can be coated on or off line. 820300. Light duty automotive fuel economy...trends through 1982. J. P. Cheng, E. I. LeBaron, J. D. Murrell, and S. L. Loos, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. EPA Fuel economy figures are presented for model year 1982 cars and light duty trucks. Comparisons with the MPG figures of prior years are included. Sales penetra- tions of various vehicle, engine, and emission control design features are given, and domestic cars' MPG characteristics are compared to that of imports', gasoline vehicle MPG is compared to Diesel MPG, and 49-states MPG is compared to California MPG. Usage of newer vehicle technologies is continuing to increase, leading to continued growth in fuel economy capability in spite of stringent emission standards. 820301. TFC/1W In 1982. Richard C. Wiquist, Chrysler Corp. TFC/IW, total fuel consumption divided by inertia weight is reported with other engineering variables for recent EPA data for industry passenger cars and trucks. TFC/IW is used in comparisons between gasoline and diesel engines, 49 States and California, passenger cars and trucks. The California fuel economy penalty due to more stringent emissions standards is discussed. The relationship between TFC/IW and ton miles per gallon is shown. Special attention is focused on 4 cylinder gasoline powered vehicles in 49 States passenger car fleet. The use of TFC/IW to answer the question, 'What Changed?' when comparing the fuel economies of two fleets is described. 820302. A data-based simulator for predicting vehicle fuel consumption. Axel B. Rose, John N. Hooker, and Glenn F. Roberts, Transportation Energy Group, Energy Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN.; and Jeffrey Hodg- son, Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Univ. of Tennessee. A hybrid system, combining on-road testing and statistical modeling, has been developed which permits calculation of a vehicle's fuel consumption over any driving cycle. An instrumentation system permits collection of the necessary on-road and laboratory test data within a relatively short period of time and, once calibrated, the model requires considerably less CPU time for execution than engi- neering simulation models while providing results within 820305 5 % of on-road measured fuel uses. The model has been run in conjunction with optimization routines for deriving minimum fuel use strategies for a variety of common driving maneuvers. Results for a 1979 Ford Fairmont wagon are given. 820303. Stability and performance analysis of automobile driver steering control. R. Wade Allen, Systems Technology, Inc., Hawthorne, CA. This paper reviews and expands previously published driver steering control models. The driver model is structured to control vehicle heading angle and lane position. Field test data are used to validate model structure. The closed-loop stability of the driver/vehicle system is analyzed using a two degree of freedom vehicle dynamics approximation. This analysis is used to develop constraints among the various driver model parameters and their dependence on vehicle characteristics. Driv- er/vehicle model approximations are also used to explore the effects of driver behavior on steering performance. 820304. The fitting of linear models to driver response records. L. D. Reid and W. O. Graf, Institute for Aerospace Studies, University of Toronto, To- ronto, Ontario, Canada.; and A. M. Billing, Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Com- munications, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. An optimal model parameter selection algorithm has been employed in the fitting of linear driver models to a range of experimentally recorded driving data. The driving tasks analyzed were performed in a driving simulator and consisted of lane tracking and obstacle avoidance. It is shown that appreciable differences in driver model performance can result from selecting either an open-loop or a closed-loop analysis framework. The effects of averaging the experimental data before processing are also highlighted with specific examples. 820305. Closed loop automobile maneuvers using pre- view-predictor models. W. Riley Garrott, Vehicle Research and Test Center, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, East Liberty, OH.; and Douglas L. Wilson and Richard A. Scott, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg. and Applied Mechanics, Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Two computer models of drivers using preview predictor strategies have been successfully implemented in con- junction with a recently developed, all digital vehicle simulation. The driver models determine control inputs to the vehicle simulation by first predicting future vehicle position and velocity and then determining the steering and braking commands necessary to move the vehicle from the predicted to the desired path. Full technical details of the method of implementation for each of the models are given. The results of sample simulations of the driver-vehicle system using each driver model are shown. Problems of each model are discussed. 61</page><page sequence="43">820306 820306. Closed loop automobile maneuvers using describ- ing function models. W. Riley Garrott, Vehicle Research and Test Center, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.; and Douglas L. Wilson and Richard A.

Two computer models of drivers using describing function strategies have been successfully implemented in con- junction with a recently developed, all digital vehicle simulation. The driver models determine control inputs to the vehicle simulation by means of feedback loops. Two feedback loops, an outer one on lateral position and an inner one on heading angle are used to determine the steering commands needed to move the vehicle to the desired path. One feedback loop on forward^velocity is used to determine braking and acceleration commands. Full technical details of the method of implementation for each of the models are given. The results of sample simulations of the driver-vehicle system are shown and the results discussed. 820307. The effect of simulator motion on driver per- formance. Brian S. Repa and Philip M. Leucht, Engineering Mechanics Department, General Motors Research Laboratories.; and Walter W. Wierwille, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ. The effects of physical motion and vehicle responsiveness on driver performance were investigated with a moving- base driving simulator. Twenty-four subjects were divided into four motion conditions ranging from no motion to roll plus yaw plus attenuated lateral translation. Each motion group drove the simulated vehicle with three levels of tire cornering stiffness. The presence of motion reduced driver control activity and path keeping deviations, but the effects of changing vehicle responsiveness were not disguised by reducing the number of motion cues. The results suggest, however, that motion cues become more important as driving maneuvers become more extreme. 820309. On measuring automobile seat ride comfort. J. H. Varterasian, Engineering Mechanics Dept., Gen- eral Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. A ride number to measure the "ride comfort" of an automobile seat has been developed that could be used to numerically rank nearly all seats. In this research, ride comfort is regarded as the characteristic of the seat that isolates an occupant from annoying road vibrations. The results were obtained from a program where subjects rated a variety of different seats on a paired comparison basis. The ride number is a result of arranging the measured dynamic seat parameters in an empirical formula for the best correlation with the subjective ratings. As a result, the ride number agreed with 67% of the ratings; this compares with a 60% agreement for a ride measure based on the International Standards Organization (ISO) comfort criterion for humans. When similar seats (bucket seats) were considered, the agreement with the ride number was 80%, while with the ISO ride measure it was 65%. The ride number, being "tuned" particularly to automotive vibra- tions, has shown that, in general, seats need not be heavy to provide traditional ride comfort. 820310. Vehicle operating experience with the Garrett/ITI GT601 gas turbine power unit. Paul D. Olivier, Garrett Turbine Engine Co. An extensive test program has been accomplished for commercial trucks and tracked military vehicles utilizing the Garrett GT601 gas turbine engine. The on-going program provides a development history of the GT601 truck engine as well as the installation and operating experience gained during the military mechanized infantry combat vehicle (MICV) test program. Problem areas and design improvements initiated to solve them are presented in considerable detail. Sufficient charts, graphs, and photographs are provided to clarify detailed technical material. 820314. Water addition to gasoline - effect on combustion, emissions, performance, and knock. J. A. Har- rington, AMOCO Research Center, Naperville, IL. A single cylinder engine was used in studies to determine basic combustion, emission and performance character- istics of water-gasoline mixtures, with water introduced to the intake manifold as a liquid or a vapor. Measurements on ignition delays, combustion intervals, power, exhaust temperature, knock and exhaust emissions were made over a range of operating conditions. Test conditions which included several values of speed, engine air flow, spark timing, mixture ratio and water addition rate were chosen to isolate effects of individual parameters and as such are not typical of conditions used with practical engine systems. The results of this basic study were used to determine the effects of water and its state of matter on the measured parameters. With respect to gasoline, water-gasoline mixtures have slower burn rates, with both ignition delay periods and combustion intervals being longer. Minimum advance for best torque (MBT) spark timings are advanced relative to gasoline values. Knock limited spark advance is extended with water addition. Power at constant equivalence ratio and engine airflow is decreased while fuel and energy consumption are increased. Water has virtually no effect on CO concentration in exhaust gases and has a slight effect on HC concentrations. A small decrease in HC concentration is observed at water levels below the saturation limit of air but an increase occurs at higher levels. The concentration of NO is decreased with added water. Lean limits of operation are compromised. Due to the high latent heat of vaporization of water, the magnitude of effects on combustion and emissions is much larger with water as a liquid than as a vapor.

Richards, Univ. of Technology, Loughborough, Leicestershire. This paper describes the performance and emissions of -a spark-ignited engine using a dual-fuel mixture of petrol and a small flow rate of hydrogen. Such an engine can be run at all speeds with a wide-open throttle and the specific fuel consumption and B.T.E. figures indicate a greater part load efficiency than those from a throttled engine. Similar results are also presented using a higher com- pression ratio of 11.7:1. Emissions data indicate reduced levels of CO, C02, and NOx at part load due to the very lean mixtures used. No problem of backfiring has been experienced since the concentration of hydrogen is very low. Work is continuing on the storagevof the hydrogen in a suitable hydride and on a mechanism to introduce the hydrogen directly into the engine cylinder, rather than into the intake system. 820316. Dual-fueling of a single cylinder diesel engine with simulated low-Btu lignite gas as the primary fuel. T. R. Lalk, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Texas A&amp;M Univ., College Station, TX.; and J. R. Blacksmith, Radian Corp., Austin, TX. The results of an experimental investigation of the use of low-Btu gas, such as would be obtained from the gasification of lignite, as a fuel for diesel engines is reported. The performance of a small (3.5 bhp) single cylinder diesel engine operating as a dual-fuel engine with low Btu gas as the primary fuel was determined, and compared to conventional diesel performance. Low-Btu gas (150 Btu/scf) was mixed with the intake air and inducted into the engine where the mixture was ignited with a "pilot" charge of diesel fuel. The effect of increasing the amount of gaseous fuel input on the power output, diesel fuel consumption, and efficiency was investigated at three speeds by conducting constant speed tests with the engine mounted on a hydraulic dynamom- eter test stand. Results are presented as plots of the performance variables as functions of the richness of the gas - air mixture that was inducted. At a speed of 2800 rpm, operating in the dual-fuel mode, the diesel pilot charge supplied only 30% of the total energy input to the engine (70% supplied by gas) at 95% of maximum power output. At higher speed (3100 rpm) maximum power output was limited by misfire and stalling to only 70% of that obtainable from conventional diesel operation. Advancing the injection timing resulted in realization of full power with a 65% reduction in diesel fuel consumption compared to that required to produce the same power operating as a conventional diesel. Brake thermal efficiency for dual-fuel operation was 5% to 10% lower than the values for conventional diesel operation. Engine knock was expe- rienced at high power levels and advanced injection timings, and limited the output when operating in the 820320 dual-fuel mode. 820317. Evaluation of cottonseed oils as diesel fuel. E. F. Fort and P. N. Blumberg, International Har- vester.; and H. E. Staph and J. J. Staudt, Southwest Research Institute. Experimental fuels made up of cottonseed oil, transes- terified cottonseed oil (methyl ester) and No. 2 diesel fuel have been compared to a baseline No. 2 diesel fuel in a turbo-charged, open chamber diesel engine. All fuel blends were analyzed and their properties compared to those of typical No. 2 diesel fuels. Test results include data on performance, gaseous emissions and limited (200-hour) cyclic durability. Crankcase oil samples were withdrawn at regular intervals during durability tests and analyzed for indications of fuel-lubricant compatibility. The paper presents the data obtained and discusses effects of fuel properties and engine operating conditions on the short and long-term response of existing diesels. 820319. (SP-511) Characteristics and performances of thick film pressure sensors for automotive appli- cations. Roberto Dell'Acqua, Giuseppe Dell'Orto, Franco Forlani, and Antonio Puzone, Marelli Autronica S.p.A., Pavia, Italy.; and Claudio Canali, Univ. of Bari, Italy. Taking advantage of thick film resistors ^piezo-resistive properties, a certain number of pressure sensors has been developed for automotive applications. The main applications are related to manifold pressure measurements in ignition and injection electronic systems for conventional and turbocharged engines, in oil and air monitoring systems for cars and heavy trucks, in diagnosis benches. The new developed sensors fulfil the requirements for low cost, high performances and high reliability necessary in today's automotive electronic control systems. On the other side they can also successfully replace the mechan- ical and conventional pressure sensors (i.e. LVDT, Potentiometrie) already used in the above mentioned applications. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820320. (SP-511) Absolute pressure transducer for turbo applications. M. E. Rosenberger, MICRO SWITCH, a Honeywell Div. This paper describes a piezoresistive, absolute pressure transducer. It is designed to meet the stringent require- ments of intake manifold pressure measurement on turbocharged engines. Pressure media containing gasoline, oil or water have virtually no effect on the transducer's performance. In the past, the demand for a sealed, vacuum reference has required using the active (electrically connected) side of the silicon chip as the pressure interface. To allow other than clean, dry air as a pressure medium, protective coatings or liquid isolation have frequently been used. But their use often requires performance tradeoffs. No isolation or coating is required with the design 63</page><page sequence="45">820320 described in this paper. Instead, the active chip side is evacuated, exposing only the passive side to the pressure media. This effectively eliminates the need for tradeoffs in achieving media compatibility. 820322. (SP-511) A Karman vortex airflow sensor. T. Sasaki and Y. Asayama, Electronic Engine Control Section, Himeji Works, Mitsubishi Elec- tric Corp., Himeji, Japan.; Y. Motoyoshi, En- gineering Department, Kitaitami Works, Mitsu- bishi Electric Corp., Itami, Japan.; and H. Yamamoto and T. Fukami, Engineering De- partment, Oval Engineering Corp. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. A Karman vortex airflow sensor has been developed and adopted to a new electronically controlled fuel injection system, named ECI, of Mitsubishi Motors' 1.8 and 2.0-liter naturally aspirated and turbocharged engines. The sensor consists of an airchannel with a triangular strut to generate the Karman Vortex Street, a couple of ultrasonic transmitter and receiver to detect the vortexes, and a control unit using custom designed ICs. This paper presents the principle, the construction and characteristics of the sensor. SAE Trans., Vol . 91 820323. (SP-51 1) A new electronic engine control system using a hot-wire air flow sensor. Takao Sasa- yama, Takeshi Hirayama, Matsuo Amano, Shinichi Sakamoto, Masayuki Miki, Yutaka Nishimura, and Sadayasu Ueno, Hitachi Res. Lab., Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. A hot-wire air flow sensor which can directly measure the intake air mass flow has been developed, and a micro- processor based engine control system using the sensor has been designed. The sensing probe of the sensor is formed from a small wire-wound resistor, and installed in the bypass of the intake passage. The sensor requires a good signal processing method under pulsating flow conditions because of its quick response. New control technologies were examined for the prototype engine control system, using the sensor, as applied to a 4 cycle, 4 cylinder engine. The air-to-fuel ratio, ignition timing, and EGR rate are controlled to their optimum values by a microprocessor which processes signals of this sensor and of other sensors indicating the engine operating condi- tions. The results of engine performance tests show that the output power, fuel economy and exhaust emissions are improved significantly in comparison with other fuel management systems.

The ability to test mass air flow meters under simulated temperature, humidity, and altitude conditions is crucial to successful product development. A closed loop test facility has been developed for this purpose and will be discussed in the paper. Environmental simulation capa- bility, mass flow measuring technique, and various instrumentation methods are covered.

Bhinder, School of Engineering, The Hatfield Polytechnic (Hatfield, Herts, U.K.). Single stage turbochargers capable of producing boost pressure ratios of 4:1 or higher offer many advantages such as low unit cost, simple and compact installation and relatively a high figure of reliability. However, published data on single stage high pressure ratio turbochargers are scarce. In this paper the design and performance of three inward flow radial turbine rotors are described. The rotors were designed for 4:1 stage pressure ratio. 820327. (SP-514) Development of a broad range turbo- charger using compressor-to-turbine bleed. James L. Harp, Jr. and Robert A. Yano, Thermo Mechanical Systems Co., Canoga Park, CA. A turbocharger, incorporating bleed flow from the compressor to the turbine, was developed towards the objective of improving the lug performance of the Army's VHO diesel engine, without the complexity of variable geometry diffuser vanes. An existing VHO engine turbocharger was redesigned and modified for bleed flow testing. The bench and engine test results indicated that the configuration bleeding from both the diffuser hub and the diffuser vane suction surface gave over 75% improvement in baseline engine lug torque. In addition, the bleed flow turbocharger gave improved engine BSFC, with a measured value of less than .39 lb/bhp hr. The lug torque improvements were obtained while maintaining rated engine power. The results of this program indicate that the bleed flow turbocharger can give significant improvements in lug engine performance without the complexity of variable geometry diffuser vanes. 820328.

In order to make clear the relation between the efficiency and the internal flow condition of a centrifugal com- pressor, the theoretical analysis and the experiments were performed using three kinds of impellers and fifteen kinds of vaned diffusers. The boundary layer analysis, in which the cross flow is considered approximately, was carried out. The low energy flow on the shroud side and the blade suction side of the impeller was indicated both from the calculation and the experiment. The static pressure 64</page><page sequence="46">recovery coefficient of vaned diffusers and the optimum flow incidence angle were investigated. This paper describes the calculation and the experiment results. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820329. (SP-514) Investigations into the performance of highly turbocharged diesel engines. A. G. Osborne and F.

A single cylinder engine, which is based on a current production engine data, has been specially built for experimental work. A mathe- matical model has been prepared to predict the inlet and exhaust manifold conditions for the single cylinder case. The paper describes the design features of the single cylinder experimental engine and also an outline of the mathematical model.

After a description of the operation of the device, the Authors examine the possible advantages which may be obtained both in terms of engine emissions and of fuel consumption in comparison with engines simply equipped with turbochargers or with homogeneous reactors. 820332. Newly developed Ni-Zn alloy plated steel sheet "SZ" and its application to automotive usages. Ryoichi Noumi, Hajime Nagasaki, Yoshihiko Foboh, and Atsuyoshi Shibuya, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. Recently, it has become more important to improve the corrosion resistance of automotive body panels, and the amount of coated steel sheets has been increasing for this application. Several types of coated steel sheet, such as Zincrometal, hot-dip galvanized steel sheets, galvannealed steel sheets and electrogalvanized steel sheets are widely available. Sumitomo Metal Industries have studied new coated steel sheets for automotive body panels, and have succeeded in the development of the new NiZn alloy plated product "SZ", the deposit of which includes about 13% nickel. This paper discusses the plating conditions, production process, properties and performance of SZ. 820333. The effects of metal finishing on the appearance of painted galvanized steel. C. Christ, Research Center, Armco Inc., Middletown, OH. 820335 Nitrogen finished galvanized steel and other grades of zinc coated steels with little or no zinc-iron alloy layer have been found to accept normal metal finishing techniques without adversely affecting their pretreating or painting characteristics. The finished surface is comparable in appearance to a painted cold rolled steel surface. The durability and corrosion resistance of the painted metal finished surface from which all zinc has been removed is equivalent to that of painted cold rolled steel. Grades with appreciable zinc-iron interfacial alloy in the coating microstructure can be a problem when the alloy is exposed by metal finishing. Iron-zinc surfaces have a tendency to cause cratering in electrocoat primers. 820334. Corrosion behavior of electrophoretically coated cold roiled, galvanized and galvannealed steel sheet for automobiles - adaptability of catapho- retic primer to zinc plated steel. Yasuhiko Miyoshi, Yoshihiro Oie, Minoru Amano, and Hideo Koyahara, Products Research and De- velopment Laboratories, Nippon Steel Corp., Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan. The corrosion behavior of cold rolled-, galvanized and galvannealed steel sheet was investigated. Unpainted, ED painted and three-coat painted specimens were used. Cataphoretic primer prevents corrosion on the underlying steel more effectively than an anaphoretic primer. Ca- thodically electropainted cold rolled steel exhibits a good film adhesion in all tests. In alternately wet and dry conditions cathodically electrodeposited zinc plated steels show a better adhesion property than anodically elec- trodeposited ones. Upon consideration of actual car driving conditions, it was concluded that zinc plated steels, as well as cold rolled steel, are suitable for cathodic painting system. 820335. "MONOGAL": a new anti-corrosion material for the automotive industry. Jean Samson, Coated Sheet Products, Usinor (France).; and Charles Brun and Suzanne Mathieu, Research Center, Flat Rolled Div., Usinor (France). MONOGAL is a coated steel developed to improve the corrosion resistance of exposed automotive body appli- cations. Its process is based on the brittleness of the rjzinc coating in a range of temperatures below the melting point of the zinc. MONOGAL is produced on a hot dip galvanizing Une; at the exit of the pot the free zinc is brushed off the light side of the differentiaUy coated sheet. Side 1 of MONOGAL presents a very thin and continuous layer of iron-zinc diffusion alloy with no free zinc. Side 2 is a standard G90 or G60 zinc coating. The iron-zinc alloy layer has excellent antigalling properties which improve the formability of MONOGAL over the two side hot dip galvanized steel with the same r value. MONOGAL also shows good weldability, paintability and corrosion resis- tance. 65</page><page sequence="47">820336 820336. The pretreatment of steel and galvanized steel for cathodic electrodeposition paint systems. James W. Davis, Amchem Products, Inc., Ambler, PA. The advent of cathodic electrodeposition in the auto- motive industry has brought about substantial changes in the pretreatment of steel and galvanized steel surfaces and the testing thereof. Cyclic scab blistering tests, water soak tests, coating solubility, coating porosity and ESCA/ SEM/Auger surface analysis techniques have provided significant insights into the factors that optimize the performance of zinc phosphate coatings for cationic paint systems. Specifically, the crystal structure and iron content of the phosphate coating and a chromium based post-rinse have been shown to make a significant effect upon the subsequent corrosion resistance properties of the phosphate/me tal/CED paint system. Further, ESCA/ SEM surface analysis and accelerated testing have shown that the processing method substantially affects both the crystal structure and composition of the coating. 820337.

Masayuki Kawachi and Tomiharu Okita, Research &amp; Development Section, Furukawa Aluminum Co., Ltd.; and Kan Kanbayashi, Technical Research Labora- tory, Furukawa Aluminum Co., Ltd. The serious problem encountered in the process of producing 2-piece fabricated automotive aluminum disc wheel, in which a forged disc is welded into a flash butt welded rim, lies in the development of cracks on the weld in the roll forming process. This problem was solved by grasping the most optimum flash butt welding variable of 5454 alloy stock (Al-2.7%Mg-0.7%Mn alloy) used for forming rims. 820340.

Rim section fatigue results of aluminum and steel wheels. Daniel C. Wei, Kelsey-Hayes Co., Re- search and Development Center. A rim section fatigue test technique was introduced in order to determine the actual fatigue behavior of the material at the most critical area of the rim, the inner radius of inboard bead seat area, where the ordinary crack initiation began as observed from the wheel radial fatigue test. The rim section fatigue S-N curves at the stress ratios of R = 0.1 and 0.5 for the 1008 steel and aluminum 5454 rims were presented. FEM was employed to determine the stress levels corresponding to the test loads used during the rim section fatigue test. A fairly good agreement has been shown in all comparisons of FEM results and strain gage measurement. Tensile and bending fatigue data from the flat specimens of the sheet metals with 30% cold rolling were used to compare with the rim section fatigue results. It was concluded that the equivalent amount of simple cold rolling to the material at the inner radius of inboard bead seat area of the rims appeared to be near 30%. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820342. The Centrue/Pierce process for improved wheel uniformity control. Joseph Guzek, Motor Wheel Corp. This is a presentation of a new method of manufacturing stamped steel automotive wheels that results in better uniformity control for improved ride. The process involves the production of a wheel assembly having a semi-finished bolt circle and pilot area, then finishing this area relative to the tire bead seats. The benefits of this process are reduced radial non-uniformity, reduced non-concentricity of bolt circle to center pilot, and the ability to control the location of the low point of the first harmonic of radial non- uniformity for purposes of tire-wheel match mounting. 820343. Development of aluminum disc wheel for truck and bus. Tadayoshi Nöda and Naoshige Ueki, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd., Osaka Steel Works.; Hideo Komatsu, Sumitomo Metal In- dustries, Ltd., Central Research Laboratories.; and Kouji Nishimoto and Takehisa Shimazu, Isuzu Motors, Ltd., Research &amp; Engineering Div. Lightening the weight of the materials of trucks and buses is getting more attention from the view point of save- energy since the oil crisis. Because of this reason, high tensile strength steel plates, aluminum alloys and plastics are now much popular as the material of the trucks and buses. By utilizing the existing hydraulic 9,000 tf press, Sumitomo has, in co-operation with Isuzu Motors, Ltd., successfully developed and commercialized the beautiful aluminum wheels for the trucks and buses, which is superior with regard to the strength and durability, the 30% of the weight reduction of the wheel was achieved as compared to the steel disc wheels. The application of aluminum wheels promises the reduction of fuel cost, allows more loading weight on the trucks and buses. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 66</page><page sequence="48">820344.

Research on vehicle mobility in snow has recently become significantly updated by the use of instrumented vehicles. Utilizing triaxial load cells in the front wheel assemblies, the vehicles are capable of measuring the traction and motion resistance forces located at the tire/snow interface. Based on these measured quantities, snow surface char- acterization parameters are developed. Also, using an energetics approach, a tire performance parameter is developed which offers a measure of the slip-shear energy expended by a tire in moving a unit distance. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820347. An update of applicable automotive engine rotary stratified charge developments. Charles Jones, Curtiss-Wright Corp., Wood-Ridge, NJ. Curtiss-Wright's rig results to support development of a large Rotary (Wankel-type) direct injected stratified charge multi-fuel Military engine are related to earlier automotive-sized engine data. The comparisons indicate similar thermal efficiency of the larger 350 C.I.D. single rotor rig and the 60 C.I.D. size. However, improved configurations and basic technology advances have been realized during development of the larger module which have not been tested on the smaller engine. Relevant growth studies for General Aviation engines are summarized and test data indicating directions for significant improvements in specific fuel consumption at lean mixture strengths, via turbocharging, are presented 820350 and reflected in automotive model Rotary engine projec- tions. System analysis shows sizeable fuel economy gains of naturally aspirated and turbocharged Rotary stratified charge over existing automotive engines. These improve- ments would be additive to refining and increased energy yield benefits that accrue to use of a broad-base middle distillate fuel by an engine configuration of demonstrated wide fuel tolerance. 820348. The Orbital engine. Peter Ewing, Orbital Engine Co. The Orbital Engine is a new internal combustion engine displacer. Development of a 7 chamber 3.5 litre Otto cycle version has shown that it is approximately one third the size and weight of similar displacement conventional powerplants, can be perfectly balanced, and features an inherent combustion chamber gas motion which is the basis for a new and efficient combustion process. Development has overcome mechanical and gas sealing problems and the fuel consumption and emissions results presented compare favourably with other engines. When fully developed the engine will offer large fuel economy gains in automotive applications due to its light weight, small size and efficient combustion. Discussion: B. L.

Shoichi Furuhama and Yoshiyuki Kobayashi, Musashi Institute of Technology (Tokyo, Japan). According to results of a number of studies made in past concerning premixed hydrogen-air engines, the problems lay in the low output, backfire and NOx emission. In addition, the necessity to reduce the fuel tank weight and volume for automobile application existed. In order to meet these requirements, Musashi Institute of Technology in Tokyo developed a method as an ideal fuel system, by inserting a small-sized LH2-pump ih a LH2-tank, forcing high pressure LH2 into a low temper- ature and high pressure gas hydrogen container of 1/ or so, and injecting cold GH2 of -30 to -50°C during the first half of the compression stroke of a two-stroke engine. In this manner, two passenger cars were tried, with a 3-cylinder and 0.55/ engine installed in one of them and a 3-cylinder and 1.1/ engine installed in the other. It was demonstrated through engine dynamometer tests and on-vehicle tests on a test course that above mentioned problems could be all solved. Engine maxi- mum power was improved by 20 to 30% as compared with gasoline engines, and backfire was prevented completely. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820350. The development of mixture injected surface- ignition engine. Van Sudhakar, Cummins Engine Company, Inc. The feasibility of igniting lean air-fuel mixture with a torch formed by injecting a stoichiometric mixture over a hot surface near the end of the compression stroke is 67</page><page sequence="49">820350 explored and proved. Several variables affecting the performance of the mixture injected surface-ignition engine were identified, and their effects on the engine operation were examined. Lean misfire limits for engine speeds between 2000 and 3000 RPM were found to vary between air-fuel ratios 19.7:1 and 21.6 for regular blend gasoline in a 4-cylinder configuration. Fuel consumption comparisons with a standard spark-ignited engine of equal displacement and compression ratio showed improvements for the MISI engine. Specific exhaust emissions of CO, HC, and NOx from both engines were compared. The MISI engine had generally the same levels of CO and HC, and higher levels of NOx emissions than the spark-ignited engine. 820351. Pneumatic fuel metering - a new approach to advanced fuel control. Michael L. McKay, Or- bital Engine Co. Fuel metering systems for the spark-ignition engine are being developed which demonstrate the advantages of advanced metering systems in both multi-point and in-cylinder formats. The most developed technology, the multi-point manifold format, shows particular promise as being highly cost-effective, having a manufacturing base largely similar to that of carburettors. Either mechanically or electronically controlled, the system has been shown to deliver fuel sprays with considerably smaller droplet sizes than any known commercial systems, being of particular significance in alcohol fuelling applications. 820352. The Otto-Atkinson engine - a new concept in automotive economy. David Luria and Yehuda Taitel, School of Engineering, Tel- Aviv Univ., Ramat-Aviv, Israel.; and Artur Stotter, De- partment of Mechanical Engineering, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. This paper discusses the fundamentals of a new concept for an internal combustion engine which operates ac- cording to an hybrid thermodynamic cycle between the well known Otto cycle and the Atkinson cycle; thus this new engine is referred here as the Otto-Atkinson engine. The objective of this engine is to provide an improved performance characteristic in fuel consumption as well as in pollution control. An important feature of this Otto- Atkinson engine is that it enables these objectives to be relatively easily incorporated into the conventional piston type Otto engine, requiring no new technology. Preliminary experimental results comparing the per- formance of the Otto engine with three experimental set-ups of the Otto- Atkinson engine operating at the same load and speed are included. It was found that fuel consumption of the Otto- Atkinson engine was up to 19% lower, and that the CO and NOx were lower than in the conventional engine. 820353. Mod I automotive Stirling engine system per- formance. Mack W. Dowdy and Noel P. Night- ingale, Automotive Stirling Engine Program, Mechanical Technology Inc., Latham, NY. The Automotive Stirling Engine Development Program was awarded to Mechanical Technology Incorporated (MTI) in March 1978 for the purposes of developing automotive Stirling engines and for transferring Stirling engine technology to the United States. The program has made extensive use of the background in Stirling engine development at United Stirling of Sweden (USSw). Within this development program, the Mod I Stirling engine is the first engine specifically designed and built for the automotive application. During 1981, the first Mod I Stirling engine system successfully completed acceptance testing at USSw. This describes the Mod I Stirling engine system and evaluates data from the acceptance test of this first Mod I engine. Measured power, efficiency and emissions maps are presented and comparisons are made with computer code predictions. The Mod I engine demonstrated a peak power of 53.9 kW and maximum efficiency of 37.4%. The fuel consumption characteristics are compared with those of current conventional automotive engines. Measured exhaust emissions are shown to be consistent with meeting the most stringent federal emissions goals. 820354. Preliminary results on performance testing of a turbocharged rotary combustion engine. P. R. Meng, W. J. Rice, H. J. Schock, and D. P. Pringle, NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleve- land, OH. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the performance of a turbocharged rotary engine at power levels above 75 kw (100 hp). A twin rotor turbocharged Mazda engine was tested at speeds of 3000 to 6000 rpm and boost pressures to 7 psi. The NASA-developed combustion diagnostic instru- mentation was used to quantify IMEP, PMEP, peak pressure and face-to-face variability on a cycle-by-cycle basis. Results of this testing showed that at 5900 RPM a 36 percent increase in power was obtained by operating the engine in the turbocharged configuration. When operating with lean carburetor jets at 105 hp (78.3 kw) and 4000 RPM, a brake specific fuel consumption of 0.45 lbm/lb-hr was measured. 820355. (P-107) A light scattering and holographic technique for determining droplet size and volume density distribution of diesel fuel sprays. Isao Shimizu, Ibaraki Technical College.; Masatoshi Shimoda and Takashi Suzuki, Hino Motors, Ltd.; and Yasufumi Emori, Chiba Univ. In a diesel engine, the mixing of the fuel spray and in-cylinder air controls rate of heat release during combustion, namely it will determine the thermal effi- ciency, maximum output and gas or noise emission, etc. 68</page><page sequence="50">Therefore, it is important to measure the droplet size and its volume density distribution in diesel fuel sprays. The optical measuring method, which includes a light scattering and holographic technique, seems the only feasible method for analysing these unsteady character- istics of fuel sprays. The light scattering technique described herein was based upon Mie scattering theory, and the droplet size and volume density distribution of fuel sprays were calculated from the combination of the light extinction and the forward-to-backscattering ratio of Mie scattering intensity. The volume density and droplet size distribution of fuel sprays were obtained from the light intensity distribution on a photograph of fuel sprays. On the other hand, the in-line pulsed laser holography was applied for observation of droplet size of the fuel sprays, and was compared with the light scattering method. While the light scattering technique is useful for the macroscopic meas- urement of volume density and droplet size distribution of fuel sprays, the in-line pulsed laser holography enables observing them microscopically. The diesel fuel sprays from several conditions of injection system were analysed by the above-mentioned techniques, and the effects* of different specifications on volume density and droplet size distribution of fuel sprays could be clarified. 820356. (P-107) The influence of initial fuel temperature on ignition delay. L. O. Hoppie, Corporate Research Dept., Eaton Engrg. &amp; Research Center, Southfield, MI. A new model of ignition delay is formulated and the equations which govern ignition are presented. The model is based on fuel molecules having discrete allowed energy levels, and interprets radicals simply as additional allowed energy levels. Using such a model, the initial fuel temperature can readily be accounted for and its effect on ignition delay predicted. Equations for the general multi-level system are presented, as is the detailed solution for the simple two-level system. Theoretical results predict that the ignition delay can be made arbitrarily small and essentially independent of air temperature if the fuel is sufficiently preheated. 820357. (P-107) Measurement of flow velocity in diesel flames by a cross-correlation method. T. Ka- mimoto, Y. Miyairi, K. Nagakura, and S. Matsuoka, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology. A new technique for measuring velocity in diesel flames has been developed: One of the fluctuating components in a flame is detected at infinitesimally separated two points placed along the flow direction, and the time averaged phase difference between two signals is determined from the cross correlation function calculated over a thousand of cycles. Two kinds of correlation method; one focusing on the radiative intensity fluctuation and the other temperature fluctuation, have been investigated with a D. I. diesel engine at various flow fields, and the charac- teristics of each method have been made clear. 820360 820358. (P-107) Interaction of port design and injection rate for a D. I. diesel. H. F. Pettifer, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. Performance and emissions comparisons have been made between helical and directed ports for a range of injection rates. The tests were carried out on a single-cylinder research engine of 120 mm bore with a cylinder head capable of accepting interchangeable inlet ports. An important feature of the work was optimisation of the nozzle specification for each combination of port and pumping rate. The aim was to assess the advantages of each port design under various conditions. The results showed that similar performance and emissions could be achieved by both helical and directed ports. 820359. (P-107) An experimental study of swirl and EGR effects on diesel combustion by use of the dumping method. Tung Tat Chan and Gary L. Borman, Mechanical Engineering Dept., The Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison. Experimental histories of major species total concentra- tions in the cylinder were obtained for a single cylinder TACOM-LABECO diesel engine by using a dumping technique to quench the cylinder gas rapidly at various selected crank angles during the combustion and expan- sion process. Performance data using both an eight-hole and four-hole nozzle were taken for a range of swirl ratios, exhaust gas recirculation percentages and injection tim- ings at medium load and 1000 RPM. Seven dumping histories were obtained all at 1000 RPM and 0.5 equivalence ratio for selected combinations of two injection timings (15 and 25), two EGR values (0 and 10%), two swirl ratios (2.5 and 4), and two nozzle tips (4 and 8 hole). These histories show cylinder-averaged values of NOx, CO and H2 as a function of crankangle. SAE Trans, Vol . 91 820360. (P-107) Total cylinder sampling from a diesel engine (part II). X. Liu and D. B. Kittelson, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN. An improved system for total cylinder sampling from an indirect injection passenger car type diesel engine has been developed. The system utilizes explosively actuated cutters which cut aluminum diaphragms in both the main combustion chamber and precombustion chamber at a predetermined time. The cylinder charge is rapidly cooled and diluted as it flows from the chambers into the sampling system. When sampling from near top dead center, cylinder pressure decay half times of about 0.5 ms have been achieved. The system has been used to determine NOx concen- trations in the cylinder as a function of crankangle position at 1000 rpm with equivalence ratios of 0.32, 0.52, and 0.60. NOx concentrations rise rapidly shortly after the onset of combustion, attain maxima which are 2 to 10% higher than corresponding exhaust concentrations at 69</page><page sequence="51">820360 about 5-10 crankangle degrees after the end of the fuel injection process and then slowly decay to exhaust levels. 820361. In-cylinder sampling of hydrocarbons in a Texaco L-141 TCP engine. Michael C. Ingham, Chevron Research Co.; and Phillip S. Myers and Otto A. Uyehara, Dept. of Mech. Engr., Univ. of Wis- consin-Madison. Apparatus was developed to obtain time and spatially resolved gas samples from the displacement volume of a reciprocating engine. This equipment was used to study the distribution of fuel and combustion products, with emphasis on the origins and formation mechanisms of hydrocarbons, in a single-cylinder Texaco L-141 TCP engine run on heptane. Two of three potential hydrocarbon sources were identified. Frozen hydrocarbon compositions found near the head surface after 15°CA were attributed to wall quenching. Heptane found at all sampling locations prior to the start of fuel injection was associated with a source of fuel on the bowl surface. Discussion: David R. Lancaster, General Motors Research Laboratories SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820362. (P-107) Experimental determination of local H/C ratio and hydrogen-particulate. Mark R. Logan, Chevron Research Co.; and Joseph A. Gudgeon, O. A. Uyehara, and P. S. Myers, Univ. of Wisconsin. An intermittent sampling valve was used to investigate local fuel H/C ratio and species concentrations in an operating DI diesel engine. Additionally, predictions of carbon and hydrogen originating from particulates and nonmethane hydrocarbons (carbon and hydrogen re- mainders) were made by calculation. Sample H/C ratio was used to assess local fuel phase as gaseous or liquid. Evidence of intermediate species quenching in the lean region between spray plumes was found under low swirl. Reduction in the rate of penetration under high swirl may account for the observed loss in efficiency under this condition. 820363. (P-106) Digital acoustic intensity techniques in gasoline engine noise studies. T. Abe, Nissan Motor Co., presently at ISVR, Univ. of South- ampton (England).; and D. Anderton, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Univ. of Southampton (England). This paper describes the use of digital measurements to assess acoustic intensity close to the various surfaces of a two litre gasoline engine. Using phase-locked data acquisition an acoustic power balance is constructed for the engine which is shown to correlate well with three other methods - lead covering, average surface vibration level and close microphone. However, the prediction of sound pressure level from these power balances is shown to be difficult, at least at 1 m from the surface. A simple relationship between acoustic intensity and sound pres- sure level in the frequency domain has been found. 820364. (P-106) Simulation of combustion induced noise in a non-running engine structure by impulsive hydraulic excitation. J. Dixon, E. C. Grover, and T. Priede, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, The University, Highfield, Southamp- ton, England. The paper exemplifies the necessity to quantify the various noise sources present in modern automotive engines. Results demonstrate the non-linearity problems as- sociated with many of the non-running engine rig tests currently in use. A new technique is described for combustion induced noise simulation using hydraulic excitation. Results obtained using this experimental method are compared with those measured on the running engine. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820365. (P-106) Fault detection in internal combustion engines using an acoustic signal. Afarin Ordu- badi, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. The engine block vibration is the result of the structural response of the engine to its internal forces. The engine malfunctions which affect these forces also affect the vibration signal. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of using engine block vibration for diagnosis of combustion faults. A four-cylinder diesel engine was used for this study. In order to detect variations in combustion force (or equivalent cylinder pressure trace), this signal was reconstructed from the engine block vibration. Measured and modified structural responses were used to reconstruct cylinder pressure trace. The modification oř structural response was accomplished by processing its magnitude and/or phase. Finally, the method was used to detect and localize a leak in the injector of one of the cylinders. 820366. (P-106) Digital processing revitalises old tech- niques. M. D. Croker, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd. The application of modern digital processing techniques to acoustic intensity measurement, structural engine research using the "Banger" rig, and active noise control is discussed and illustrated. 820367. (P-106) An evaluation of test procedures for vehicle exterior noise. D. Morrison, Ricardo Consulting Engineers Ltd.; and P. E. Waters, Dept. of Transport (UK). There has been much discussion recently in Europe and the USA of test procedures for the measurement of vehicle drive-by noise for legislative purposes. A program was therefore undertaken to evaluate a number of these procedures for both light and heavy vehicles. A special instrumentation system was developed for this project which, whilst not essential for routine development testing, was of considerable value for research purposes and for monitoring type approval and production conformity tests. Detailed records of the vehicle operating conditions and position during the tests 70</page><page sequence="52">gave a much more thorough understanding than has been possible hitherto. Two new test procedures are proposed. One is a drive-by test which reproduces similar operating condi- tions to ISO R362, but without the anomalies inherent in that procedure. The second is a stationary test that will give good correlation with the drive-by test and can be used for development, production conformity and en- forcement testing. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820370. (P-106) Operational testing of quieted heavy-duty trucks. E. K. Bender and J. A. Kane, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., Cambridge, MA. This paper describes the operational testing of three quieted heavy-duty diesel trucks. The noise control treatments installed on the trucks included partial engine enclosures, improved exhaust systems, and 2-stage engine mounts on one of the trucks. The trucks accumulated 229,844 miles and the treatments were found to have negligible quantifiable impacts. Their operation was comparable to comparison untreated vehicles and there was no evidence of payload displacement because of the treatment weight. Predicted and observed fuel economy impacts were virtually immeasurable. Maintenance costs increased by 0.69% because of the impact of the enclo- sures on regular maintenance. 820371. The General Motors engineering staff aerody- namics laboratory - a full-scale automotive wind tunnel. K. B. Kelly, L. G. Provencher, and F. K. Schenkel, General Motors Engineering Staff. A new full-scale automotive aerodynamics wind tunnel has been constructed and placed in operation at the General Motors Technical Center. Tunnel performance and flow quality specifications have been met through appropriate choices of design criteria, construction tech- niques, and inspection procedures. Test section size, two balances, and a boundary layer suction system provide a broad range of full-size and reduced-scale model test capability. Test support, operational and engineering environments, and equipment have been specifically tailored for automotive aerodynamics requirements. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820372. Wind tunnel for aerodynamic research. Siegfried Egle, Norbert Herzum, Gunter Hofele, and Hansjorg Konitzer, Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft. The following presents in detail one full-scale automobile wind tunnel and two thermodynamic wind tunnels, their development and integration for an economic solution. Information is given on machinery equipment, air speed and temperature ranges and measurement-possibilities. Two thermodynamic test stands, smaller wind tunnels, are described. The first one is designed for measurements on heat exposed parts of the car, in particular engine cooling. The second one is able to simulate all climatic conditions and was designed for solving problems con- 820375 cerning heating and air conditioning systems. The presentation concludes with reports on initial experiences with these test facilities. 820373. Demonstration of the adaptive-wall concept applied to an automotive wind tunnel. J. D. Whitfield, J. L. Jacocks, W. E. Dietz, and S. R. Pate, Sverdrup Technology, Inc. (Formerly Sverdrup/ARO, Inc.) Tullahoma, TN. An adaptive wall test section concept applicable to automotive-type wind tunnels has been developed. Exper- iments conducted in a subsonic wind tunnel (1 ft X 2 ft test section) have established the feasibility and practi- cality of the concept. A test program utilizing three geometrically similar automotive-type models of cross- sectional area corresponding to conventional model/tun- nel blockages of 10%, 20%, and 30% was conducted with the models positioned at zero yaw and 10 degrees yaw angle. Pressure distribution data obtained using the adaptive test section demonstrated the effective elimi- nation of wall interference by properly deforming the tunnel walls using the adaptive-wall technique. These experimental tests have shown that the adaptive-wall test section concept will allow significantly larger blockage ratios than permissible in conventional wind tunnels to be tested with negligible wall interference. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820374. Correlation of aerodynamic force measurements in MIRA and other automotive wind tunnels. G. W. Carr, (MIRA). Previously reported correlation exercises involving aer- odynamic force measurements on Volkswagen and Pinin- farina reference cars have been extended to include the MIRA full-scale wind tunnel, following recent significant modifications to the tunnel and the data reduction procedure. For the Volkswagen car, this represented a repeat of tests carried out prior to the modifications. The results showed generally satisfactory correlation, for engineering purposes, between the MIRA closed-jet tunnel and the four European open-jet facilities at VW, Daimler Benz, Fiat and Pininfarina. To obtain even closer correlation in order, for example, to ensure comparability of advertising claims regarding drag coefficients, improvements will be needed in respect of wheel mounting pads, blockage and 'buoy- ancy' corrections and the standardisation of vehicle test conditions. 820375.

Mason, Jr., General Motors Research Lab- oratories.; and William H. Bettes, California^ Institute of Technology. Six-component aerodynamic force and moment data are compared from tests of four 1/10-scale truck models at four wind tunnels on the North American Continent. 71</page><page sequence="53">820375 Each model was tested in both a standard and a fuel saver configuration. The differences observed between tunnels were con- sistent for each aerodynamic component regardless of truck or configuration. The zero-yaw drag coefficients from each of the four tunnels were within ± 4 percent of the mean coefficients. The coefficient magnitudes for the other aerodynamic components showed variations that were often many times larger than those for drag. The variations between the incremental coefficients for all six aerodynamic components were less than those found for the coefficient magnitudes. A qualified comparison was made between the average drag coefficient magnitudes from the wind tunnels and those available from some on-road coastdown tests of the full-scale vehicles.

Estimates of level-road, constant-speed fuel savings from a tractor- trailer aerodynamic device were made using 1/7 scale model wind tunnel tests. These estimates were compared to fuel savings measured during a specific series of on-road tests of the same vehicle and aerodynamic device. Scale-model wind tunnel tests were run according to the SAE J 1252 procedure.Changes in the vehicle's wind- averaged drag coefficient due to the aerodynamic device were used to compute estimates of fuel savings. Scale- model details were important in computing these esti- mates. On-road fuel economy tests were run per the SAE J 1321 Type II procedure. Examples of the effects of ambient wind on aerodynamic device effectiveness meas- ured during SAE J 1321 tests are presented. 820377. A new approach to measuring road load by chassis dynamometer and wind tunnel tests. Hirohide Iwase, Shigeyuki Yamada, and Hirokazu Koga, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. Vehicle road load which must be simulated on a chassis dynamometer for exhaust emission and fuel economy tests is usually determined by on-road coastdown tests. In this study, we divided vehicle road load into rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag, and measured these forces in laboratory tests, using a high-precision chassis dyna- mometer and a full scale wind tunnel. However two problems arise. One of them is that tire loss measured on the curved drum of a chassis dynamometer is larger than on the road. Another is that aerodynamic drag measured in a closed-throat wind tunnel, which has blockage effects, is larger than on the road. To determine vehicle road load from laboratory tests, we therefore have to establish how to obtain a correction coefficient for tire loss between the actual road and the drum, and a correction coefficient for aerodynamic drag between the actual road and a wind tunnel. How we get these coefficients is described in this paper. 820380. An overview of two-piece die cast aluminum intake manifold joining. G. R. Wlodyga and S. A. Weiner, Engineering &amp; Research Staff, Ford Motor Co. This paper reviews the development of the two-piece die cast aluminum single-plane intake manifold concept at Ford, with emphasis on manifold joining. Three joining methods, mechanical fasteners plus sealant, epoxy bond- ing, and welding were evaluated. All three methods were tested successfully using 1-4, V-6 and V-8 engines. The results of a cost study indicated that in-air electron beam (AEB) welding would be the most economical joining method. Production of an EB welded die cast aluminum intake manifold was initiated Job 1, 1981 for the 1.6L 1-4 engine. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820381.

Measures, Alean Aluminum Corp., Fairmont, WV. A new aluminum alloy has been developed which, by virtue of its ultra-fine grain size, has a yield strength capability up to 18 ksi, with formabili ty equivalent to fully annealed AA- 1100-0 material. The new alloy has been particularly suited to the development of a new plate finstock alloy, FIN/255™, registered as AA-8007, which can be used to reduce fin gages in fin and tube heat exchangers by up to approx- imately 20% thereby permitting cost and weight savings. 820382.

This paper describes the experience gained in manufac- turing heat exchangers from various fin stock alloys including the FIN/255™ Alloy AA-8007 in gages from 0.0055 in. down to 0.0035 in. Particular attention is paid to the resulting performance of the heat exchangers, specif- ically the fin/tube bond, thermal efficiency, corrosion and handling characteristics. 820383.

Reynolds Tru-Color anodized product process offers a number of advantages when compared to standard integral hard coat processes. Tru-Color uses less energy, and offers a range of tones from champagne to black in hard wear-resistant finishes.

The influence of aluminum properties on the design, manufacturability and economics of an automotive body panel. W. E. Swenson, Jr., Alean Aluminum Corporation.; and R. J. Trafi- cante, Chrysler Corporation. The implementation of aluminum in today's automotive body panels is an engineering problem seeking resolution of conflicting objectives including structural integrity, manufacturability and cost. This paper utilizes the results of a computer modeling technique to show the effects of differing aluminum alloy properties on body panel characteristics including: stiffness, dent resistance, oil canning, draw-die overcrown, minimum thickness, cost and weight. Minimum cost aluminum alloy selection is shown to be sensitive to panel curvature, inner panel support, yield strength and draw-die overcrown limits. Two case studies are presented comparing 1100, 3004, 5182-SSF, 2036-T4 and 6010-T6 aluminum alloys for varying design configurations of a typical automotive hood. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820386. Engine control system sensitivity. James H. Rillings, General Motors Research Labs., Gen- eral Motors Technical Center, Warren, MI. This paper describes the use of sensitivity functions to investigate the sensitivity of engine control systems to unknown variations in parameters. The definition of output sensitivity functions and the derivation of their defining differential equations are reviewed. A structural method for generating a sensitivity model is presented and applied to a second order example. Finally, the sensitivity model for EGR valve gain of an eighteen state linear perturbation engine model is generated and the resulting sensitivity functions used to predict how engine response changes for changes in the gain of the EGR valve. These predictions are then shown to be accurate by comparison with simulations of the engine model for various values of the EGR valve gain. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820388. Closed-loop control of an engine's carbon mon- oxide emissions using an infrared diode laser. Jeffrey A. Sell and Man-Feng Chang, Research Labs., General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. The closed-loop emission control systems now on board vehicles depend on the measurement of oxygen by 820391 zirconia sensors. Therefore engine control is not based on direct detection of emissions but, instead, depends on a switch-like response to the air-fuel ratio. In this report, we show that an infrared diode laser which senses exhaust carbon monoxide levels can be used for closed-loop engine control. The dynamics of each subsystem of the laser CO sensor control loop were characterized. For a given speed-load point, the laser signal was found to be a smooth function of air-fuel ratio in the range of 14.0 to 14.9, in contrast with the Zr02 sensor which operates like a rich-lean switch. Closed-loop control of the converter inlet CO level was realized at two speed-load points, one at 1200 r/min and the other 1800 r/min, and at rich, stoichiometric, or lean set-points. Closed-loop control of converter outlet CO was also demonstrated. The laser CO sensor offers the advantages of being able to eliminate limit cycle oscillations and allowing the air-fuel ratio to be set anywhere in the range from 14.0 to 14.9. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820389. Retrofit feedback control of A/F ratio and ignition timing for fuel economy. J. E. Morris, Hugh Anderson, and Roy Smith, Physics Dept., Univ. of Wellington (New Zealand). An electronic engine management system has been developed to control both ignition timing and air-fuel (A/F) ratio to maximize fuel economy. Both controls employ feedback techniques and are therefore intrinsically adaptable to a wide variety of models, as required for a universal retrofit market. The ignition control loop monitors the position of the combustion pressure peak while the mixture control loop senses the lean limit as defined by a roughness threshold. Test results demon- strate fuel economy and transient operation. A brief background to the New Zealand energy conservation program is included as background to the system's specification. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820390. The electric choke for improved cold start control. Peter G. Berg, Texas Instruments Inc., Control Products Div. During the warm-up period of a carbureted spark ignition engine, a choke control is required to provide the rich fuel-air mixture necessary to achieve combustion. Over the past decade, a new type of choke control, which uses electrically generated heat, has been widely applied to this function. This control uses a PTC ceramic heater to rotate a bimetal coil with a level of control not achievable in previous choking systems. The purpose of this paper is to describe the operation and construction of this electric choke control as it is presently applied to production vehicles. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820391. A microprocessor controlled overdrive for opti- misation of fuel consumption. Brian M. Forster, Laycock Engineering Ltd. (Sheffield, England). This paper discusses a micro-processor controlled over- 73</page><page sequence="55">820391 drive unit which can be added, with suitable adaption to a standard 3/4 speed manual or automatic gearbox. The microprocessor either self contained or via an engine management system, uses signals of torque and speed at the overdrive to decide the optimum condition for overdrive selection on all forward gears, to give maximum fuel savings and acceptable driveability. Theoretical and practical fuel consumption figures, to the EPA schedule, show considerable fuel savings, particularly on the urban cycle where, it is concluded, overdrive will be selected under all moving conditions. As a fuel saving concept the system is unique giving performance and economy in a single package without intervention from the driver, except in respect of his driving habit. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820392. Electronic control of automobile transmissions. G. Pannier, Renault DRDA, Regie Nationale, Des Usines Renault, Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris.; and A. Laport, Renix Electronique. Renault automobiles have used electronic controls for their automatic transmissions for many years. Most recently, these transmissions have been equipped with controls utilizing microprocessor based electronics and updated sensor assemblies. This paper describes this all new electronic controlled transmission system as pro- duced by Renix Electronique and STA, both Renault affiliates in France. An explanation of the design and the interaction between the mechanical and the electronic systems is provided as well as the qualitative benefits derived. 820393. Dynamic models for torque converter equipped vehicles. Allan J. Kotwicki, Electronics Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. A dynamic model for the coupled engine-torque con- verter-vehicle system was developed to allow mathemat- ical analysis and performance prediction for engine or powertrain controls in torque converter equipped vehicles. The principal contribution of this work is the deri- vation and justification of a static nonlinear terminal model of the torque converter. This model, when ap- proximated, allows simple coupling of available engine, geartrain, and vehicle models. The resulting differential equations provide a rea- sonably simple, physically justified model for engine and vehicle behavior when driven by large signal variations in either engine net torque output or vehicle load. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820394. Microcomputer controlled automatic transmis- sion. Alan L. Miller, Borg-Warner Research Center, Des Plaines, IL. This paper will discuss the concept, design and devel- opment progress of Borg-Warner's microcomputer con- trolled automatic transmission. It was ascertained that an electronic transmission control system capable of high performance and cost effectiveness must combine both shift point and shift quality as an integrated control. Flexible shift point schedules were programmed as any given function of throttle position and transmission output shaft speed. Shift quality control includes both upshift and downshift ratio changes. This is achieved using a unique torque transducer positioned on the output shaft of the transmission. The shift quality strategies utilize this transducer in open loop algorithms and a high response closed loop torque control system. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820398. (P-105) Electric vehicle operational and impact safety testing-presentation of test results and safety-related vehicle problem identification. Robert A. Krauss, Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance, Enforcement, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Department of Transportation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has completed safety-related testing of 13 electric vehicle models which are presently on the market. This report summarizes the results of the hydraulic brake, windshield defroster, and 30 mph frontal barrier impact tests which were conducted. Performance trends are discussed and safety-related problems and defects are identified. 820399. (P-105) Electric vehicle battery charger stan- dardization. Larry E. Heisey, Battery Charger Engrg., Power Systems Div., Hobart Brothers Co., Troy, OH. Electric Vehicle (EV) battery chargers must safely and completely recharge EV batteries and do so with mini- mum involvement of the users. Industry generated standards for EV components promoting safety, inter- changeability and uniformity of features and functions will enhance user acceptance of EV's. Many standards already exist for battery chargers which are similar to those used for EV's. By reviewing existing standards together with the unique requirements of EV battery chargers, the industry will be in a position to establish standards when it has matured sufficiently to do so. 820400. (P-105) Why a standard for chopper controlled DC motors for electric vehicles?Howard B. Hamilton, Univ. of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. Chopper controlled DC motors, because of the high harmonic content of the current, require special consid- eration from the standpoint of test procedures, instru- mentation and specifying test results and motor param- eters. IEEE Std # 1 13 "Test Code for DC Machines" does not address these problems. This paper discusses the problem areas and suggests items to be included in a supplementary standard to use with IEEE #113. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820401. (P-105) Standard test procedures for electric- vehicle batteries at the National Battery Test Laboratory. F. Hornstra and N. P. Yao, Argonne National Laboratory, Chemical Engineering Div., Argonne, IL. Standard test procedures used for electric-vehicle battery 74</page><page sequence="56">testing at the National Battery Test Laboratory at Argonne National Laboratory are described. The testing falls into two general categories - performance charac- terization and life-cycle testing. Activities within these categories include receipt, inspection, and installation of batteries, pretest conditioning, capacity verification, gen- eral open-circuit stand testing, partial depth-of-discharge testing, specific energy vs. specific power testing, simu- lated electric-vehicle profile testing, peak-power meas- urements, and life-cycle testing. General descriptions are provided for all tests; further detail is provided for the simulated electric-vehicle profile tests. The results from these simulated electric-vehicle profile tests are presented for a variety of lead-acid, nickel/iron, and nickel/zinc batteries. 820402. (P-105) Electromagnetic compatibility recom- mendations for electric vehicles. Edward F. McBrien, Consultant. This paper provides an overview of electromagnetic compatibility considerations between battery powered, automotive type, electric vehicles and other electrical and electronic services. A brief historical background is provided along with a review of test data and available standards. The paper recommends that despite procedural difficulties, SAE J551 should be used to measure and compare electromagnetic radiation from electric vehicles. Similarly, SEA J1113 should be used to measure elec- tromagnetic susceptibility. The paper also recommends that acceptable procedures for determining electromag- netic compatibility of electric vehicles and other services be more fully developed. 820403. Characteristics of carbon/glass fiber reinforced plastic leaf spring. Kikuo Tanabe, Takashi Seino, and Yoshihiro Kajio, Central Engineering Lab- oratories, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., Yokosuka, Japan. We designed, fabricated and evaluated a mono-tapered leaf spring made of carbon fiber reinforced plastics. To construct the leaf spring, a carbon/glass fiber hybrid lamination was selected. This selection was made in consideration of chipping resistance, impact resistance and fatigue-resistance. We constructed a prototype of the leaf spring which weighed approximately 2 kg including the front and rear steel eyes. In comparison with the steel spring, this represents a weight reduction of 76 percent. Prototypes were put through a series of evaluations both on the bench and on the vehicle. As a result, the leaf spring proved to be better than the steel spring in such practical performance areas as car handling, riding quality and endurance. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820405. Thin line seating for small cars. Louis F. Mattia and Thomas A. Knurek, Cooper Industrial Products.; and J. Richard Langridge, Pirelli Ltd. An alternative in automotive seating suspension systems, 820408 which offers a multitude of styling variations, has been fitted into the smaller European vehicles for several years. Effective isolation and dampening are achieved through a marriage of fabric and rubber, which also produces a lightweight resilent support for seat and back cushions in cars, trucks, and public transport vehicles. Seats can now have less weight and bulk while maintaining driver and passenger comfort. This seating suspension system offers increased interior compartment room as well as the capability of being tuned for varying degrees of ride softness. Modifications to the basic seat suspension system can provide inflatable supports to customize comfort in the lower back, leg, and other areas of the body that are subject to driving fatigue. 820406. Rate of fuel permeation - test procedure study. T. G. Hutchins, Elastomer &amp; Chemical Research, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. A test procedure, simulating service conditions, has been developed for determining the Rate of Fuel Permeation through small bore fuel hoses. This new procedure is compared to a currently used "plugged hose" test method in a series of tests involving two fuel blends and four types of fuel hoses. Changes occurring in the test assemblies, including the composition of the fuel, during the test period are examined. These changes bring into question the validity of data obtained using the "plugged hose" test method. 820407. Dynamic inlet pressure and volumetric efficiency of four cycle four cylinder engine. A. Ohata and Y. Ishida, Engine Res. and Advanced Engrg. Dept., Higashifuji Technical Center, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. The inlet dynamic effect on the volumetric efficiency of a four cylinder engine was investigated, by a method of one cylinder activation. It was found that the inlet pressure profile consists of a shorter and a longer periodic component, each of which is determined by the design factors of the intake system. It was also seen that thè volumetric efficiency mainly depends on the inlet pressure during the short period before the intake valve is closed. Therefore, the relationship between the volumetric effi- ciency and the inlet system design factors was clarified by separately examining the behavior of these two com- ponents during this period. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820408. Controlling engine load by means of early intake-valve closing. James H. Tuttle, Engine Research Department, General Motors Re- search Laboratories, Warren, MI. Early closing of the intake valve was examined as a means for controlling the load of a homogeneous-charge, spark-ignition engine. The engine was operated unthrot- tled, with load controlled by closing the intake valve during the intake stroke of the engine after the required amount of charge had been inducted into the cylinder. The concept was examined both experimentally, using 75</page><page sequence="57">820408 intake cams giving reduced intake-valve lift and opening duration, and analytically, using an engine simulation. Comparisons to a conventional throttled engine operating at part load show the early intake-valve-closing engine to have lower pumping loss, lower specific fuel consumption, lower cylinder-gas temperatures, lower heat transfer, lower NOx emissions, similar combustion dura- tion and cyclic variability, and somewhat higher HC emissions. However, the fuel economy benefit offered by this load-control concept would be diminished by the frictional losses of a control mechanism and by the current trends toward lower vehicular power/weight ratios and broader-range transmissions. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820409. The measurement of fuel evaporation in the induction system during warm-up. H. C. Pao, Base Engine/Combustion Dept., Advanced En- gine Engineering, Ford Motor Company. The quality of the intake mixture is characterized by vaporized fuel, small airborne fuel droplets, large airborne liquid fuel droplets and wall deposited fuel. Sampling probe and calorimeter methods have been used to study the development of these four forms of fuel on a Ford 6.6 litre engine during warm-up. A detailed induction fuel quality analysis for the engine operating at 1000 RPM, WOT, 14.0 A/F ratio and 20° BTDC spark timing, has revealed that the mixture quality stabilized in eight minutes. During the initial five minutes, the rate of increase in the percentage of vaporized fuel, |dPv,s/dt|, is approximately equal to the rate of decrease in the percentage of net wall deposited liquid fuel IdP^/dtļ, i.e., dPv,s/dt = -dP^/dt = Con- stant. The total percentage of large and small airborne fuel droplets did not change during the initial transient. The effects of intake manifold pressure, intake air velocity and intake mixture temperature on the amount of atomized fuel are more significant at transient than at stabilized conditions. When the intake manifold pressure was reduced by 15 kPa, the increment of atomized fuel at one minute was 6 times higher than that at the stabilized engine condition (15% vs. 2.5%). Changes in pressure, velocity and temperature are not linearly related to the increment in the atomized fuel percentage, e.g., AP = -15.2 kPa yielded a 15% increase in atomized fuel while only a 20% gain resulted when AP = -34 kPa. 820410. A study of gas exchange process simulation of an automotive multi-cylinder internal combustion engine. Masaaki Takizawa, Tatsuo Uno, and Toshiaki Oue, HIGASHIFUJI Technical Cen- ter, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.; and Tadayoshi Yura, Osaka Institute of Technology. This paper describes a simulation program of gas exchange processes in a multi-cylinder internal combus- tion engine and also describes its applicability to auto- motive engines which are operated under various engine speed and load conditions. This simulation program has sufficient flexibility to incorporate almost all intake and exhaust systems of today's high speed automotive multi-cylinder engines. To improve the predicting accuracy, a finite difference scheme is used for solving equations defining gas flow dynamics in these systems and moreover a modified Constant-Pressure Theory is used for modeling branches of intake and exhaust manifolds. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the simulation program, predicted results were compared with exper- imental data and satisfactory agreement was obtained. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820411. The effect of local heating on A/F ratio control. Charles F. Aquino, Control Systems Depart- ment, Engineering &amp; Research Staff - Research, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. The effect of local heating on transient A/F excursions is investigated experimentally on the 5 Liter Central Fuel Injected engine. Data are presented which show the effect of heating the throttle plates and plenum floor respectively on transient A/F excursions, and these data are inter- preted in relation to a dynamic wall-wetting model. The benefits of local heating for reduction of A/F transients during warm up are also discussed. 820412. Nighttime visibility of various types of road markings; a study on durability, including con- ditions of rain, fog and dew. Gerard J. Blaauw and Pieter Padmos, Institute for Perception TNO, Soesterberg, The Netherlands, Working Committee E9 of the Study Centre for Road Construction (Arnhem, The Netherlands) and the Study Centre for Traffic Engineering (Drie- bergen-Rijsenburg, The Netherlands). Nighttime visibility distances of various retroreflective stripes and raised pavement markers were determined in practice, on a dry and wet pavement and in the absence of public lighting. In addition, optical characteristics were measured in relation to the time lapse after application, in order to assess the effects of dirt and wear. Results were described in terms of coefficients of retroreflection, which were also used to predict visibility distances under other conditions than measured. Stripes with a vertical profile and raised pavement markers both are better alternatives for nighttime visibility on wet roads than the more usual paint and thermoplastic markings. The raised pavement markers at first have a better visibility than the stripes, but are more sensitive to dirt and wear on a dry pavement. Dew appears to deteriorate the retroreflection of the raised pavement markers by a factor of up to twenty; a smaller effect is found for the stripes. 820413. Perception of delineation devices in road work zones during nighttime. Hans Godthelp and Johan B. J. Riemersma, Institute for Perception TNO, Soesterberg, The Netherlands. 76</page><page sequence="58">A functional description is given of delineation systems used in work zones. Based on a theoretical analysis predictions are made about the effectiveness of particular delineation systems as a reference in perceiving course and speed. Furthermore, a laboratory experiment is described, in which the effectiveness of a number of delineation systems as a means of preview guidance was investigated. It is concluded that delineations which are mounted at eye height function poorly and that im- provements can be reached by lowering the delineation. In addition, it is concluded that the use of a chevron configuration on panels may be particularly effective in conditions where panels are placed somewhat haphaz- ardly or when only a limited number of panels is used. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820414. Nighttime driving and visual degradation. H. W. Leibowitz, Pennsylvania State University.; D. Alfred Owens, Franklin and Marshall College.; and Robert B. Post, University of California, Davis. Recent developments which provide new insights into night driving accidents are reviewed. Selective Degrada- tion : The mechanisms subserving steering are different from those underlying hazard recognition and these two modes of processing visual information are selectively impaired at night. Although it is possible to steer a vehicle as well at night as during the day, the ability to recognize and respond to infrequent hazards is seriously degraded. Night Myopia: Many individuals become nearsighted under reduced illumination. The finding that this is a normal consequence of the passive return of the accom- modative system to an intermediate resting position has led to a procedure to ameliorate this effect. By deter- mining the value of an individual's dark focus it is possible to provide a special night driving prescription which effectively eliminates night myopia. Night driving will always be hazardous. To the extent the danger is caused by night myopia it can be fully corrected by a simple optical procedure. However, becase part of the risk results from the unjustified self-confidence associated with the selective degradation of visual functions at night, other procedures are necessary. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820415. Visual behavior of novice and experienced drivers. Masami Nagata, The Institute of Vocational Training.; and Hiroshi Kuriyama, Industrial Products Research Institute. A new and simple technique of simultaneous measure- ments was developed to investigate changes in drivers' eye fixations. Using an eye marker system and reference targets mounted on the front bumper of a vehicle, the visual behavior of novice drivers was compared with that of experienced drivers to find visual cues of skillful handling. It was found that the increase in horizontal angular displacement of fixations is approximately linear with the increase in the head displacement. Coefficient of deter- 820418 mination for the novice groups is smaller than that for the experienced groups. Vertical angular displacement of fixations was almost the same for both the novice and experienced drivers, but head displacement for the novice drivers was the head-up type and that of the experienced drivers was the general or direct type.

The visibility distance of a car-driver in a nighttime driving situation depends on several parameters includ- ing: size of the object to be detected, its reflection coefficient, and the position of the object. The material presented is a description of the influ- ences of possible parameters during nighttime driving on the visibility distance or on the vision range of a car-driver. 820417. Steady-speed particulate emissions from the GT-225 automotive gas turbine. Charles C. Matthews, Fluid Dynamics Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. A GT-225 automotive gas turbine has been tested for particulate emissions at steady speeds on a chassis dynamometer. The object was to develop test criteria and data sufficient to enable the design of a facility for transient particulate testing of gas turbines. The steady-speed test rig is described, along with the instrumentation, test methods, data reduction, and meth- ods of sample analysis. The need for cooling the exhaust gases by dilution, analogous to diesel particulate tests, is also shown. Steady-speed test data are presented to show the effects of vehicle speed or load, engine cycle temperature, six different fuels, and two different combustors on the particulate emissions. Generally, the steady-speed par- ticulate emissions were extremely low, with particulate emissions indexes less than 0.01 g/kg fuel at normal operating conditions. Most particles are less than 0.1 /xm in diameter, and roughly 90% of the mass is sulfate. These results should not be extended to other gas turbine engines. In fact, they may not fully characterize the GT-225 engine, since only one-half of the exhaust was examined. 820418. Experimental study of an integral catalytic combustor-beat exchanger for Stirling engines. Daniel L. Bulzan, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. An experimental study was conducted to determine the feasibility of using catalytic combustion with heat removal for the Stirling engine to reduce exhaust emissions and also improve heat transfer to the working fluid. The study was conducted using spaced parallel plates. An internally air-cooled heat exchanger was placed between two noble 77</page><page sequence="59">820418 metal catalytic plates. A preheated fuel-air mixture passed between the plates and reacted on the surface of the catalyzed plates. Heat was removed from the catalytic surface by radiation and convection to the air-cooled heat exchangers to control temperature and minimize thermal NOx emissions. The study was conducted at inlet com- bustion air temperatures from 850 to 900 K, inlet velocities of about 10 m/s, equivalence ratios from 0.5 to 0.9, and pressures from 1.3 X 105 to 2.0 X 105 Pa. Propane fuel was used for all testing. Combustion efficiencies greater than 99.5 percent were measured. NOx emissions ranged from 1.7 to 3.3 g N02/kg fuel. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the concept and indicate that further investigation of the concept is warranted. 820419. Plastic parts by reactive processing - a technology for the future. William L. Kelly, Ashland Chem- ical Co. Traditional processing techniques such as compression molding and injection molding are and will undoubtedly continue to be primary methods for producing plastic parts for the future. They are, however, very capital intensive and energy intensive. As a result, parts fabri- cated by these techniques must necessarily be increasingly expensive as energy and capital costs rise. We would propose that reactive processing, which includes methods such as RIM, RTM, LIM, etc. offers very beneficial economic alternatives for a variety of parts to these more traditional processing methods. Reasons for the positive economic benefits of reactive processing compared to injection or compression molding relate to the low capital and energy requirements for these newer techniques. At present, molders have a relatively limited number of materials to choose from for use in reactive processing equipment, but work on material systems is extensive and it is predicted that a variety of new formulations will be available in the near future to satisfy a broad range of end-use requirements. 820420. Developments in nylon 6 block copolymer RIM. James D. Gabbert, Albert Y. Garner, and R. M. Hedrick, Monsanto Co., St. Louis, MO. Nylon 6 block copolymers (NBC) are a new family of resins capable of a wide range of properties. The resins have good resistance to heat and possess a good balance of impact strength and stiffness. The chemistry and the NBC reaction injection molding process are discussed, along with resin properties and the effects of resin variables on properties. 820421. Application of Titanate Coupling Agents in Mineral and Glass Fiber Filled RIM Uretbane Systems. S. J. Monte and G. Sugerman, Kenrich Petrochemicals, Inc., Bayonne, NJ.; and A. Damusis and P. Patel, Polymer Institute, Univ. of Detroit. Glass fibers are used in RRIM Urethane to provide dimensional stability and good physical properties - particularly impact strength. However, 1/16" milled glass fibers have the disadvantages of high cost (approximately 82$/lb., anisotropic impact properties and difficult han- dling and process characteristics. Acicular type fillers, such as Wollastonite, provide tempting substitution possibilities because of lower price, isotropic impact properties and inherent easier handling. However, un- treated Wollastonite grades provided inferior properties when compared to silane sized 1/16" milled fiberglass. Silane treated Wollastonite, G Wollastokup 1100 0.5, has shown promise but falls short in the important area of impact. This paper will demonstrate that the use of Wolla- stokup KR TTS 0.5 (22&lt;P/lb.) appears to provide equiv- alent impact while elongation, tear strength, tensile strength and flexural modulus are higher, process viscosity 16% lower and offering a 60$/lb. savings when compared to silane sized 1/16" milled fiberglass at the 40% loading level (24.1% on total composite) in hydroxyl component.

Frisch, Department of Chemistry and Center for Biological Macromolecules, State University at Albany, Albany, NY. In this paper, we review iķe synthesis, morphology, and physical and mechanical properties of IPN's as well as the related pseudo-IPN's in which only one of the polymers is cross-linked. Recent studies have shown that the degree of phase separation achieved in these materials is strongly dependent on the compatibility of blends of the linear polymer constituents of the IPN components, as well as the kinetics of chain extension and the presence of grafting between component polymers. We illustrate this by a series of IPN's consisting of a polyurethane and an acrylic copolymer. The acrylic is a typical automotive enamel. An enhancement in properties results which is dependent on the amount of grafting and the kinetics of polymerization. Also discussed are IPN's of a polyur- ethane and an epoxy, which exhibited a synergism in adhesive properties, and IPN's of a RIM polyurethane with several epoxies and unsaturated polyesters.

Approximately four years ago, a new production process for automobile door liners was introduced in Europe. The process consisted of stretching a sheet of unsupported, expanded PVC over the mold cavity. The mold was closed and clamped and a polyurethane structural foam mixture was injected by the RIM method through the top half of the mold. The pressure and temperature of the expanding mixture forced the vinyl to conform to the contours of the cavity thus producing a finished door liner (polyurethane foam/vinyl composite). This process showed promise but 78</page><page sequence="60">had several drawbacks. Over the past two years, cycle times have been reduced to 2 minutes, intricate surface detail has been achieved and other formable surfaces have been substituted for the vinyls. These improvements have made it a candidate product for the U.S. auto industry. 820424. Iron-zinc alloy electroplated steel for automotive body panels. Tsutomu Watanabe, Masaru Ohmura, Toshiyuki Honma, and Takeshi Adaniya, Technical Research Center, Nippon Kokan K.K. (Fukuyama/Japan). Iron-zinc alloy electroplated steel for automotive body panels has been developed. This newly developed steel is produced in a conventional electrogalvanizing line using electrolyte composed mainly of iron salt and zinc salt. Corrosion resistance after electropainting of this product is quite excellent, the same as that of galvannealed steel and much better than that of electrogalvanized steel and cold rolled steel. Weldability of this product is also the same as that of galvannealed steel. Adhesion of the deposit is better than that of galvannealed steel and no "pimple" problems occur during stamping. Thus, this product possesses advantages of both galvannealed steel and electrogalvanized steel. 820427. A comparison of corrosion test methods for painted galvanized steel. E. T. Nowak, L. L. Franks, and G. W. Froman, Inland Steel Re- search Labs., East Chicago, IN. Various galvanized steels, ZINCROMETAL and cold- rolled steel were painted with automotive-type paints and tested via accelerated, atmospheric and on-vehicle tests. Tests indicate that the ASTM B 1 17 salt fog test and the Kesternich S02 test do not yield results which are indicative of automotive, in-service corrosion perform- ance. A modified Volvo scab corrosion test was found to offer an accelerated method to accurately predict auto- motive, in-service corrosion performance. Galvanized steels exhibited corrosion resistance which was far superior to ZINCROMETAL and cold-rolled steel. Thicker zinc coatings on steel were found to offer better corrosion protection to painted substrates. 820428. Water-based automotive rustproofing. Irwin R. Ehren, William A. Higgins, and John Bretz, The Lubrizol Corp. The advent of catastrophic corrosion of automotive vehicles in the late 1950's and early 60's, the reasons for it and the causes of continuing high rates of corrosion have been reviewed many times and will not be belabored here. In spite of the significant progress made by the auto- motive industry to engineer vehicles that are more resistant to corrosion, the need for improved rustproofing compounds continues to be as important as ever before. During the past twenty years, a number of organic solvent-based rustproofing compounds have been used in aftermarket and in-plant applications to enhance the resistance of automobile and truck bodies to corrosion. 820432 The organic solvent content of these materials ranges from 40% to 70% accompanied by flash points as low as 10°C (50° F). Thus, the solvent content of these beneficial compounds represents potential fire and health hazards as well as contributing to air pollution. Furthermore, the escalating cost of petroleum-based solvents, although stable at present, represents a future incentive to identify a substitute. The answer to obtaining a solvent which is non-toxic, non-polluting, non-flammable, and price stable is water. 820429. PSZ ceramics for adiabatic engine components. M. E. Woods, Cummins Engine Company, Inc.; and Isao Oda, NGK Insulators, Ltd. Partially stabilized zirconia is an insulating ceramic which offers high strength, high thermal expansion, and wear resistance. Low thermal conductivity provides the re- quired insulation, high strength improves reliability, and high thermal expansion provides a simple means of attachment for ceramic engine components. Pistons, cylinder liners, and cylinder heads have been insulated with PSZ and engine tested in an adiabatic diesel engine. 820431. Capabilities of heat insulated diesel engine. Toshio Yoshimitsu, Kosuke Toyama, Fumihide Sato, and Hiromasa Yamaguchi, Engine Re- search Div., Oyama Plant, Komatsu Ltd. A six cylinder direct-injection diesel engine of 105 mm bore was modified for heat insulation and turbocom- pounding. The insulation was provided by entirely eliminating cooling water and replacing major hot parts with the ones having air gap or ceramic insulator in their structure. The engine was run with three different fuels; Diesel fuel with 52 and 30 cetane number and coal derived fuel, SRC-II. Due to the elevated temperature of combustion chamber in the insulated engine, ignition delay was significantly shortened and helped to burn the low cetano fuel. The engine could run with SRC-II, cetane number less than 10, though the rate of pressure rise was excessive at light load. Cylinder liner temperature was almost 400° C and way above the empirical limit for conventional water cooled engine but the engine could complete a couple of 250 hour durability test. Combining with turbocompound system, the heat insulated engine was concluded to be a very viable approach for the high thermal efficiency and crude fuel acceptability of future engine. 820432. Preliminary survey of possible use of the com- pound adiabatic diesel engine for helicopters. H. Dean Wilsted, U.S. Army Research and Tech- nology Labs. (AVRADCOM) Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, CA. The gas turbine Engine is universally used in military aircraft because it is simple, lightweight, and reliable. However, the small engine (500 hp category) has a specific fuel consumption (SFC) generally above 0.6 (pounds of 79</page><page sequence="61">820432 fuel per brake horsepower hour). Future improvements will decrease the 500 shaft horsepower engine to an SFC of 0.43. However, the adiabatic diesel has demonstrated an SFC of only 0.285. This is a reduction of 52% over existing engines and, compared to future engines, a savings of 41% is possible, so why stay with the gas turbine engine? Well, other requirements must also be satisfied. For example, how heavy can the engine be? A compu- tation using the Blackhawk helicopter as an example shows the allowable specific weight of the engine to be 0.76 lb/hp. This computation is based on allowing the engine to increase in weight to offset fuel, tankage, and support weight saved such that the take-off gross weight of the aircraft is not changed. This is felt to be attainable and examples of paper designs available in the literature are briefly discussed. This preliminary study indicates that the Army helicopter fleet fuel consumption could be reduced by more than 40% if it could be retrofitted with adiabatic compound diesel engines. Furthermore, the logistics problem would not only be reduced by 40%, but since most Army trucks and tanks use diesel fuel the supply system would also be greatly simplified. 820434. (P-106) Light-weight, quiet automotive D.I. diesel engine oriented design method. K. Ochiai and K. Yokota, Isuzu Motors Limited. From a view point of environment protection and energy saving on the world-wide basis low pollution, quieter and light-weight direct injection diesel engines for automotive use have been strongly requested. In order to meet these social requirements we have endeavoured to develop design methods for such engines available at the design stage. Firstly, we have clarified relationship between vibra- tion and radiated noise using simple 2 cylinder block model. Secondary, we have successfully developed light- weight, better fuel economy and quieter multi-cylinder research engines which have potential to be able to meet more stringent legislative standards for noise and gas emissions to be expected in the late 80's. This paper summarises mainly the process to develop multi-cylinder engine to be lighter and quieter and also refers to the effects compared to current ones. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820435. (P-106) Evaluating engine design for low noise using dynamic structural modeling. J. Affenzeller, AVL-Prof. List Ges.m.b.H., Graz, Austria.; and G. E. Thien, AVL-Prof. List Ges.m.b.h., Graz, Austria. A study has been carried out with the aim to develop a model for the prediction of the vibration transmission from the piston top to the block structure via the crank train and for the prediction of the block noise radiation. This paper outlines the basic work, which was done in this study on a 4-cylinder tractor diesel engine with 98 mm bore. During the investigation some remarkable results have been obtained, e.g. that the influence of oil film stiffness and damping values on the vibration transmis- sion is of less importance during the combustion period. Finally the influence of design parameters on the vibration transmission is described in this paper. Some of these parameters are more or less flexible bearing caps, increased main bearing wall thickness, stiffening ribs on the block outer surface, cantilevered main bearing design and reduced weight of the crankshaft.

This paper presents structural analyses performed on an in-line, four-cylinder, two-liter automotive diesel engine for vibration reduction purposes. Both finite element modeling and experimental structural analysis were performed on the existing design. After applying both of these methods to the same structure, the reliability of the structural model was established. The finite element model, which was constructed as simple as possible, could then be used for predicting the effect of design changes on the structural behaviour of the block. A relatively simplified finite element model proved a very useful and accurate tool. 820437. (P-106) Finite element optimisation techniques of diesel engine structures. N. Lalor, Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Univ. of South- ampton, UK. The Finite Element Method is now widely used by industry for the prediction of stresses and the vibration behaviour of machines. Accuracy of prediction is con- tinuing to improve as the technique develops and more and more computing power becomes available. In recent years, noise has been included in the number of constraints that the designers must consider and the finite element model is gradually being introduced as a tool to this end. However, the possession of an accurate tool for predicting the noise is not synonymous with the provision of a solution to the noise problem. Direct predictive techniques can only examine each solution considered by the designer on a trial-and-error basis, which can prove very expensive in computer time, particularly if a dynamic model is used. A method is therefore described by which a static finite element model can be optimised for minimum noise, if necessary within the constraints imposed by existing manufacturing plant, by an automatic iterative procedure. In this way, the most efficient solution to a noise problem can be rapidly obtained. 820438. (P-106) Idealization, measurement and calcu- lation of an engine block. M. Birth and S. Papez, Volkswagenwerk AG. This paper describes static, dynamic, and acoustic finite 80</page><page sequence="62">element analyses of the engine block of a water-cooled 4-cylinder in-line engine, the results were later compared to measurements. In order to locate the critical zones of the crankcase, a rather coarse general model was analyzed first, followed by detailed analyses of a number of subregions. It was found that the results obtained from the idealized structure agreed quite well with static and dynamic measurements performed at the same time. Static deformations found in the various zones yielded important information concerning the stiffness of the crankcase. By introducing a number of specific alterations it was possible to influence the stiffness of the crankcase, reduce stresses and decrease wear. Dynamic analysis showed the prevailing natural frequencies as well as some information concerning those sections of the crankcase which are either suitable or unsuitable for attaching ancillary devices. Further measurements were made to study the overall noise emission of the running engine, the dominant frequencies of sound, and the major causes of noise. The acoustic behavior of a side wall of a crankcase together with some geometric variations was investigated by computing the sound intensity quotients. Sound intensity measurements confirmed the results of these computations to a large extent. 820440. (P-106) Determining vibration, radiation effi- ciency, and noise characteristics of structural designs using analytical techniques. Paul A. Hayes and Curtis A. Quantz, Noise Control Technology, Cummins Engine Co., Inc., Co- lumbus, IN. An analytical method is presented for calculating vibra- tions and radiation efficiencies from a structural model. The three areas addressed are 1) determining the dynamic characteristics of structures using finite element tech- niques; 2) generating input functions from empirical data; 3) calculating radiation efficiencies of the structure from a finite element model. Finally, a systematic method is presented for combining these parameters to calculate sound power. Experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of this technique in the development of low noise hardware. 820441. (SP-514) The 4- and 5-cyiinder turbocharged diesel engines for Volkswagen and Audi. W. Brandstetter and R. Dziggel, Volkswagenwerk AG, Wolfsburg. Volkswagen produces a series of 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder naturally aspirated Diesel engines of the swirlchamber type since 1978. On this basis the development of a 4- and 5-cylinder turbocharged engine was begun. The paper describes the design and development highlights of the 4-cylinder engine with a nominal power of 51 kW and the 5-cylinder version with 64 kW power output. The performance characteristic of the major engine 820445 components as well as exhaust emissions and fuel consumption, measured on the engine dynamometer and in actual vehicle installation, are reported.

Nissan's new 2.8 liter in-line 6-cylinder turbocharged engine was developed for the Datsun 280ZX in order to achieve higher performance and improved fuel economy. The Electronic Concentrated Engine Control System (ECCS), controlled by microprocessor, is provided for this 2.8 liter turbocharged engine. ECCS controls fuel injec- tion, ignition timing, EGR rate and idling speed. It solved the problems related to power and fuel economy by optimizing the control parameters. Further, this system contains a barometric pressure compensator and a detonation controller; thus, the performance of this engine is efficient over a wide range of circumstances and fuel octane ratings. During the development of the engine, computer simulation was employed to predict engine performance and select turbocharger size, valve timing and other important factors. 820443. (SP-514) Downsizing and Downspeeding of automotive diesel engines - theory and practice. Andreas Mayer, Gerhard M. Schruf, and Hubert Kirchhofer, BBC Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie., Ltd. From a comparison of different methods of supercharging it becomes evident that the pressure-wave-super-charger is a highly efficient device of improving fuel economy of automobiles without loss of performance. Tests on a chassis-dynamometer and computer simulations show that it is possible to save up to 25% of fuel and at the same time to reduce the emissions of exhaust gases considerably by "Down-Sizing" and "Down-Speeding". 820444. Structural changes in the world auto companies: the emerging Japanese role. Martin L. Anderson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Japan's recent dominance of the international auto industry does not result from some major single factor, such as technological superiority or advanced automation. It derives from twenty years of building flexible, durable industrial systems - integrating assemblers, suppliers, and related companies. Current competitive advantages result from combinations of seemingly unrelated company, government, and labor practices. Japan's position of leadership will instigate major changes in international labor forces, corporate strategies, and government policies, as former auto powers adapt to new competition, and simultaneous shifts in energy and economics.

Cohen, Grad- uate School of Business, New York Univ. 81</page><page sequence="63">820445 International investment by large auto firms has led to a global integration of production. Ford's European Au- tomotive Operations (EAO) are a prime example of the strategy of integrating plants in order to respond to competition and to gain greater economies by serving new markets with a world car. Ford's strategy has included shifting production operations to low labor cost areas, seeking subsidies on new investment, and cutting labor and materials costs. The second part of this paper examines whether Ford's reorganization has parallels in the recent changes in the U.S. auto industry. It evaluates changes at the regional, urban and factory level and tendencies to subsidization and component outsourcing. SAE Trans., Vol . 91 820447. Closed loop design for electronic diesel injection systems. M. U. Trenne, Transportation Elec- tronics Div., TRW Inc., Farmington Hills, MI.; and A. P. Ives, Lucas Micos Limited, Lucas CAV (Cirencester, England, U.K.). Consumer expectations of automotive diesel performance combined with stringent emission statutes have accel- erated the development of electronically controlled diesel fuel injection systems which provide precise control of the quantity of fuel injected and the timing of injection. A comparison of closed loop and open loop control techniques in this application is presented with closed loop control shown to exhibit superior accuracy, response time and disturbance input rejection characteristics while offering the potential of relaxed actuator specifications.

This paper will outline one new in-line injection pump that is being released to production and the electronic controls that go with this pump and the other pumps that are currently in production. The in-line pump has an internal timing device and is designed to be especially compatible with the timing requirements needed for emission control. With the electronic controls the fuel injection pumps will have many advantages. The electronics will make the pump smooth and easy to use. The flexibility of the electronics will make possible a much better timing strategy which will approach the ideal emissions fuel consumption compromise. The use of the PROM will impact the large inventory of pump specifications and reduce the turnaround time for service. 820449. Capabilities of diesel electronic fuel control. L. A. Reams, T. A. Wiemero, M. B. Levin, and W. R. Wade, Engineering and Research, Ford Motor Co. The effects of current mechanical fuel control systems on CVS emissions and maximum fueling rate smoke levels of light-duty Diesel engines were investigated. A comparison of emission projections made from steady state mapping data and actual vehicle emission test results indicated that modifications to the transient fueling characteristics had the potential to reduce particulate emissions by over 20%. An experimental Diesel electronic fuel control system was developed and used to assess the effects of fuel control system modifications on Diesel vehicle emissions and smoke levels. Modified governor characteristics were shown to provide a 37% reduction in particulate emissions relative to the baseline min-max governor. Maximum fueling rate calibrations were developed to provide constant smoke levels across the engine speed range. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820450. An approach to the application of fuel injection equipment for passenger car Diesel engines. Ludwig Walz, Robert Bosch GmbH (Stuttgart/ West Germany). The range of applications for Diesel engines, especially for automotive Diesel engines, is steadily increasing. High fuel costs, increasingly severe emission and fuel consumption regulations together with the driver's comfort expectations place increasing demands on the fuel injection system. To satisfy these requirements, the engine's needs must be precisely determined. A suitable fuel injection system can then be defined and its components matched to the engine. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the necessity for a close cooperation between the engine and the fuel injection equipment manufacturer, to describe the appli- cation process and to show the fuel injection equipment for automotive Diesel engines.

Purchasers of expensive new electric vehicles (EVs) or hybrid vehicles (HVs) seem likely to use them as intensively as possible, not merely as second cars. This paper investigates intensive-use strategies for such vehicles at private households by means of a digital simulation using the travel day data from the 1977 Nationwide Personal Transportation Study. A "car-of-choice" usage strategy, in which the next home-based trip at a multi-car household takes the electric or hybrid car whenever it is available and has adequate seating capacity and range, leads to almost as much EV/HV use and travel electri- fication as the absolute maximum possible with perfect planning. Under this simple strategy, a single EV with four seats and a 100-mile range at each multi-car household would electrify almost 60 percent of all vehicle miles of travel by multi-car households. Average EV travel would then be some 20 percent above the average for all personal vehicles. A range-extension hybrid could elec- trify an equal amount of travel with a useful electric range of only 60 miles. 82</page><page sequence="64">820453. (P- 105) Regional analysis of potential impacts of electric and hybrid vehicles on electric utilities. Robert F. Giese, Margaret K. Singh, and Martin J. Bernard, Argonne National Laboratory, En- ergy and Environmental Systems Div., Argonne, IL. This paper analyzes the impact of electric and hybrid vehicle (EHV) charging requirements on electric utilities. The impact for the five EHV scenarios examined generally is small, with total EHV electricity consumption in the HIGH scenarios representing ~3% of projected U.S. electricity demand in 2000. However, in several areas, EHV electricity consumption in the HIGH scenarios represents a sizable fraction of electricity demand in 2000 and would have to be included in utility planning. Based on 1979 fuel prices, the total marginal cost of electricity (excluding taxes) for off-peak EHV charging ranges from $0.017/kWh (Federal Regions I and X) to $0.051/kWh (Federal Region II). 820454. (P-105) Recharging loads on electric utilities due to electric vehicles. J. Mader, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA.; and S. J. Kiselewich and W. F. Hamilton, General Re- search Corp., Santa Barbara, CA. Depending on whether they recharge immediately after their final return home each day or much later at night, electric vehicles may increase existing peaks in electricity demand or fill in nighttime valleys when existing demand is low. These extremes are quantitatively projected and compared using travel data from the 1977 Nationwide Personal Transportation Study and a model of hour- by-hour operation at nearly 300 large US electric utilities. The travel data shows that final returns home are heavily concentrated around dinner time. Joint distributions of distances traveled and times of final return home are presented, and combined with a battery recharge profile to yield typical hourly recharging demands per electric vehicle. Similar hourly demands are developed for late-night recharging which might be induced by time- of-day electricity pricing. Operation of the utility model with these loads shows major differences in fuels used to generate recharge electricity and in the need for additional capacity under the different recharging load profiles. 820455. Rolling resistance performance of passenger tires during warm-up - speed, load, and inflation pres- sure effects. T. C. Warholic, General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Tire rolling resistance during the warm-up period plays a significant role in vehicle fuel consumption, a major concern in todays world. In order to better understand tire rolling resistance during warm-up, several passenger tires were evaluated on a 67" indoor test wheel. A variety of current production tires was tested under various con- ditions of speed, load and inflation pressure, and the rolling resistance during warm-up was recorded. The warm-up behavior of each tire, being exponential in nature, was characterized by a representative amplitude 820459 ratio and time constant. The results presented show the effects of speed, load and inflation pressure on these characterizing parameters. 820456. Instrumented objective tire/vehicle handling testing. R. J. Strange, B F Goodrich Co. A method of objectively evaluating the handling char- acteristics of tire/vehicle systems has been developed which gives repeatable results. This testing utilizes high speed, on-board minicomputer technology to acquire, analyze, compute, and store data giving the test operator immediate access to test results. 820457. An experimental study of the effects of wheel and sidewall parameters, on tire power loss. Alan L. Browne, Engineering Mechanics Department, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. While developing an analytical model for tire power loss, it was observed that the thermal state of a tire, and thus the factors which affect this thermal state, have a large influence on predicted levels of power loss. An exper- imental program was conducted to determine the actual magnitude of such effects. Parameters chosen were those capable of altering the thermal state of the tire by changing the rate of heat flux from its surface. Specif- ically, test results are presented which include the effects of wheel material, venting, and blading, and various types of tire sidewall roughness including lettering. Among all configurations tested, power loss was found to be least for smooth sidewall tires on wide, nonbladed, and nonvented plastic wheels. SA E Trans., Vol . 91 820458.

Such continual supervision is attained by the application of wireless system. The sensor on the tire has no power supply. It transmits echo radio wave by the excitement of its element, which is originated by the transporting radio signal from the detector on the car body. The device employs fail-safe system and its key components are consisted of passive elements, so that the device provides high reliability. 820459.

(P-107) Opacity and photoacoustic measurements of diesel particle mass emissions. David M. Roessler, Physics Dept., General Motors Re- search Labs., Warren, MI. We have compared the capabilities of two optical instruments - a conventional opacity meter and a pho- toacoustic device developed in our laboratory - as tools for measurement of diesel particulate emissions. The devices were tested using emissions from several 5.7 / engines operated at various steady-state conditions of speed and load and also over the Federal Test Procedure driving cycle. The photoacoustic instrument is about 10 times more sensitive than the opacity meter. Further, unlike the opacity meter, its calibration to give mass concentration is independent of particle size variations. 820461. (P-107) Real-time measurement of diesel par- ticulate emissions by the PAŠ method using a C02 laser. Hidenori Osada, Junji Okayama, Kozo Ishida, and Osamu Saitoh, Horiba, Ltd. This paper reports on real-time mass concentration measurements using the technique of photoacoustic spectroscopy. The measurements were made using a differential photoacoustic cell in which infrared absorp- tion by diesel particulates at the 10.59 ¡i m wavelength was measured with a 2.2 watt C02 laser. Infrared absorption of the diesel particulates of 10.59 /xm wavelength was treated as Rayleigh absorption since the mean mass diameter is around 0.1 /im and small enough to neglect the size effects. A dual cell method allows the separation of the particulate absorption signal from that of interfering gases present in diesel engine exhaust. In practice the sample gases from the dilution tunnel were introduced into two cells, one with and one without a particulate filter. The signals were calibrated by simultaneous measurement using the diesel particulate filter method of the U.S. EPA. The sensitivity of each PAS cell was found to depend upon the flow rate of the sample, the pressure in the cell, and the modulation frequency of the incoming light source. It was adjusted to be 2.0 mV/mW • cm1 at the longitudinally . resonant frequency of 1.69 kHz where background acoustic noise is negligibly small. The results indicate that the PAS signal is linearly proportional to the mass concentration of the particulates in the range of 2.0-140 mg/m3 within an accuracy of 15%. The response time of the measurement is less than 5 seconds. SAE Trans., Vol . 91 820462. (P-107) In-cylinder measurement of particulate number density and size. Hang Xu, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Zhejiang Univ. (People's Republic of China).; and P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI. A technique to determine time and space resolved particulate number density and size in the cylinder of an operating diesel engine is described and sample data presented. Basically the technique uses Mie scattering of a laser beam passed through the jet of gases leaking through a 0.015 diameter orifice inserted into the combustion chamber. Number density and size are inferred from measurements of scattering as a function of angle of scattering. The data show a linear relationship between exhaust measurements using this technique and Bosch smoke meter readings as well as an approximately linear relationship between in-cylinder measurements of number density and mass measurements made by collecting particulates flowing through the 0.015 in. orifice on a filter.

Hill, New York State Dept. of Environmental Conservation, Albany, NY.; and S. Shimpi and R. Jorgenson, Cummins Engine Co., Columbus, IN. A Tapered Element Oscillating Micro-balance (TEOM), consisting of a tapered tube fixed at the wide end with a filter element attached to the narrow end which is free to oscillate, can monitor diesel exhaust particulate by drawing a sample through the filter element. As partic- ulate mass accumulates on the filter, a small change in the frequency of oscillation, directly related to mass, is detected in real-time. As described in this study TEOM sensitivity on the order of 5 X Kh8 g-sec*1 may be achieved over sample periods of 8-15 seconds. Two light duty diesel vehicles were tested using FTP-Bag III and NYCC driving schedules. For 29 vehicle tests, the mean ratio of total TEOM mass to simultaneously collected 47 mm filter samples was 0.96 (C.V. = 13%). Real-time TEOM data should prove valuable to particulate control technology efforts and environmental impact assessment. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820464.

I. diesel engine were investigated under various operating conditions through the measurements of KL factor and flame temperature via the two-color method, whose reliability had been substantiated by a comparative measurement with the direct sampling meth- od. The measured time histories of KL factor and flame temperature show that under all conditions studied soot is promptly formed just after the start of diffusion combus- tion phase and peaks at around the end of injection, then is oxidized rapidly, followed by the termination of oxidation when the flame temperature drops to 1800 K. 84</page><page sequence="66">SÄE Trans, Vol 91 820466. (P-107) Kinetic aspects of diesel soot coagulation. George W. Smith, Research Laboratories, Gen- eral Motors Corp., Warren, MI. In order to control the formation of particulate carbon during diesel combustion it is important to understand the mechanisms and kinetics of formation. This report addresses several aspects of diesel soot formation, focus- ing primarily on the influence of coagulation processes on the spherule size and kinetics of formation. Our previously developed nucleation/depletion model for the spherule size of particulate carbon has been modified to take account of coalescent coagulation during the early stages of diesel soot formation. Such coagulation should not increase spherule size by more than a factor of two or three. Simple coagulation theory has been employed to calculate the time constants for coalescent and chain- forming coagulation. Kinetics aspects of other processes - nucleation, particle fusion, dehydrogenation, depletion of precursors, and oxidation - have also been assessed. SAE Trans, Vol. 91 820467. (P-107) The role of nitrogen in the observed direct microbial mutagenic activity for Diesel engine combustion in a single-cylinder DI engine. J. D. Herr, M. Dukovich, and S. S. Lestz, The Pennsylvania State University.; J. A. Yergey and T. H. Risby, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, The Johns Hopkins Univer- sity.; and S. B. Tejada, Mobile Source Emission Research Branch, U.S. Environmental Protec- tion Agency. This study shows conclusively that some of the direct microbial mutagenic activity of the soluble-organic- fraction from Diesel particulate matter can be attributed to 1-nitropyrene. 1-nitropyrene has been shown to be formed by the nitration of pyrene, and pyrene is one inherent product of the diffusion-controlled-combustion of hydrocarbons that occurs with Diesel engine operation. Nitrogen dioxide, in the presence of water vapor, is shown to be a potential nitrating agent, and this gas can be produced by the high temperature oxidation of the nitrogen contained in the oxidant. These results are based on studies which used a well-documented engine, model fuel, model oxidants, and synthetic lubricant. 820469. (SP-507) A computer model for simulating an unrestrained driver in frontal collisions. Sheldon L. Stucki, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.; and Michael U. Fitzpatrick, Fitzpatrick Engineering. This paper discusses the development, test case simulation and preliminary sensitivity study of a computer model designated SCORES (Steering Column and Occupant Response Simulation). The model was developed to simulate an occupant impacting a steering assembly in a frontal collision. The interactions of various body regions with steering assembly contact surfaces are modeled by 820474 defining the force deflection properties. During the impact event, the program describes the rotation and deformation of the wheel about the column, rotation, displacement and stroke of the column due to occupant loading and intrusion. Applications of the model could be: • To reconstruct actual accident cases. • To assess safety performance of steering assemblies. • To predict improved performance of steering assemblies. 820471. (SP-507) Effect of restraining belts in preventing vehicle-occupant/steering-system impact. Ronald L. Huston and Mark W. Harlow, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Uni- versity of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH.; and Ronald F. Zernicke, Dept. of Kinesiology, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA. Restraining belt configurations are studied to determine their effectiveness in restricting occupant motion and occupant impact with the steering system. The study is conducted using the UCIN-CRASH computer simulation model. In the study, a head-on collision is simulated and the occupant response, with various restraint configu- rations, is monitored. The results demonstrate the effec- tiveness of the shoulder belt/lap belt combination as opposed to lap belts alone in preventing occupant impact with the steering system. Also, restricting the leg motion is found to have a beneficial effect in reducing injury- causing forces. 820473. (SP-507) Evaluation of current energy-absorbing steering assemblies. Charles Jesse Kahane, Na- tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration staff evaluated the actual costs, benefits and crash performance of current energy-absorbing steering assemblies as part of its review of existing major regulations. The evaluation was based on statistical analyses of Fatal Accident Reporting System, National Crash Severity Study and Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation data, cost ana- lyses of production steering assemblies and review of test results. Energy-absorbing steering assemblies have sig- nificantly reduced deaths and serious injuries and they are cost-effective. Nevertheless, many serious injuries to the thorax and other body regions still occur with the current systems. 820474. (SP-507) Steering assembly performance and driver injury severity in frontal crashes. Donald F. Huelke, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI. An analysis of 211 automobiles having the ball- type E.A. device (GM cars - 1972-1980), involved in frontal crashes was made to determine the relationship between driver injury and the steering assembly. The majority of the drivers had MAIS of 0 or 1 (66%). The head was the most frequently injured body region with the lower extremities next in frequency. Of the unrestrained drivers studied, 85</page><page sequence="67">820474 43% had a thoracic injury, the majority of which were minor. There is no correlation between injury severity and steering rim or spoke deformation, or the amount of E.A. column compression. Specific terminology for certain aspects of the E.A. performance are suggested. 820475. (SP-507) Laboratory study of factors influencing the performance of energy absorbing steering systems. John D. Horsch, Kent R. Petersen, and David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Depart- ment, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. The study was directed toward improving our under- standing how postcrash column compression and steering wheel deformation relate to the driver interaction with an energy absorbing steering system during automotive collisions. Frontal sled tests conducted at 19-37 km/h investigated the Part 572 antropomorphic dummy inter- action with a ball-sleeve column steering assembly over a range of column angles and surrogate postures. Neither column compression nor steering wheel deformation correlated with the mechanical severity of the test surrogate interaction with the steering system. The steering wheel deformed before the column compressed and the degree of wheel deformation strongly depended on the surrogate load distribution, the steering wheel being an important energy absorbing element. Analysis of 154 frontal towaway accidents involving GM cars further confirmed that although steering wheel deformation and column compression may be indicative of occupant loading, they do not necessarily indicate the severity of the driver interaction with the steering system.

Stucki, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.; and Neil Hannemann, Minicars, Inc. A series of static component and dynamic systems tests were conducted on a number of production steering assemblies. Based on the results of these tests the protective capability, afforded the unrestrained driver, for each steering assembly was evaluated and rated against the other production steering assemblies. The Hybrid III dummy was used in the dynamic tests and chest deflection was one of the response criteria used to assess per- formance. In addition to recording the standard per- formance criteria on the Hybrid III during the dynamic testing new techniques were developed for measuring chest contact area and abdomen penetration. 820478. (SP-507) Biomechanical evaluation of steering wheel design. Richard G. Snyder, Biomedical Department, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.; Joseph W. Young, Protection and Survival Laboratories, Civil Aeromedicai Institute, Fed- eral Aviation Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Oklahoma City, OK.; and Michael Q. Doyle, American Board of Emer- gency Medicine, Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital, Pontiac, MI. In a crash, impact against the steering assembly can be a major cause of serious and fatal injury to drivers. But the interrelationship between injury protection and factors of surface area, configuration, padding, relative position of the spokes, and number and stiffness of spokes and rim is not clear. This paper reports a series of high-G sled tests conducted with anesthetized animal subjects in 30 mph impacts at 30 G peaks. A total of eight tests were conducted, five utilizing pig subjects, one a female chimpanzee, one an anthropomorphic dummy, and one test with no subject. Instrumentation included closed circuit TV, a tri-axial load cell mounted between the steering wheel and column, seat belt load measurement, six Photo-Sonics 1000 fps motion picture cameras, and poloroid photography. Medical monitoring pre, during and post-impact was followed by gross and microscopic tissue examination. Observations from these tests are believed to be significant to both engineering of steering wheel design and medical interpretation of causation of driver injuries. 820479. (SP-507) Accident and laboratory studies of driver interaction with the steering system in European cars. P. F. Gloyns, S. J. Rattenbury, and H. R. M. Hayes, Vehicle Safety Consultants Ltd., Landford, Salisbury, Wiltshire, England. This paper seeks to provide a description of the crash environment in which a steering system has to function. The influence of FMVSS 203 on design is examined by analysing the field performances of two different groups of steering assemblies in accidents in which unrestrained drivers were either seriously or fatally injured. Improve- ments to both the method of test and the injury criterion are suggested as a result of this work. The frequency and nature of lap-shoulder belt restrained driver head or face contacts with the wheel is analysed. Again, the rela- tionśhip between these findings and current regulations is examined. Finally the results of these two field studies are compared with those obtained by other workers. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820480. (SP-507) Review of research on thoracic impact tolerance and injury criteria related to occupant protection. Robert L. Hess, Kathleen Weber, and John W. Melvin, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. The technical and scientific literature dealing with thoracic injury, to or within the rib cage, from blunt loading is reviewed. The history of the development of associated Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards is reviewed from the aspect of its relationship to the history of development of the research information. Field case data from car-to-car and car-to-tree/pole crashes has been examined and summarized. This study suggests that the 86</page><page sequence="68">laboratory research has not adequately covered the principal variables found to exist in actual injury cases. Specifically, more research attention should be given to the shape of the impactor, to the loading location and direction, and to injuries in the contusion and/or laceration family. Correspondingly, the accident inves- tigation process needs to be more sensitive to occu- pant/vehicle-interior interaction variables so that labo- ratory research can be properly guided.

Tadashi Ki taj ima, Takahiro Chiku, Yoshio Shirakura, and Masayoshi Yamada, Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd. (Japan). Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd., was the first Japanese automobile manufacturer to use monolithic catalysts to meet Japanese automotive exhaust emission standards. Monolithic cat- alysts were used in mini-car production (450 cc, 2-stroke engine) to meet the 1975 2-stroke engine emission standards. High cell density monolithic catalysts of 600 cells/in2 have been investigated recently. High cell density allows for reduced precious metal loading without reducing catalyst activity or durability when compared to lower cell density catalysts of the same volume. These high cell density monolithic catalysts have an added advantage of lowering NOx exhaust emissions. This paper describes recently developed high cell density monolithic catalysts that have been used on production vehicles since August 1981. 820484. Detection of missing bearing clips using micro- wave resonances. A. L. Merlo, DI-AG NOSTIC Instrument Research Co. An "End of Line" inspection problem involves the detection of missing bearing clips.Microwave resonances can be a useful tool in "Non-invasive" detecting of these missing clips. The mechanism involves the sensitive relationship exhibited by the resonance with regards to the crank angle at which the resonance appears. "The Resonant Crank Angle." This angle depends upon the exact physical dimensions of the cylinder in combination with the selected microwave frequency. The map of the spread in crank angular position of a resonance for engines with bearing clips intact serves as a reference to compare with a similar map from an engine with a missing clip. Solutions to the Microwave Model equation are given to illustrate the sensitivity of the method with regards to the frequency and mode selected. 820485. Testing the adhesives and sealants of the 80's. Jack Baldwin, Materials Development and Test- ing Laboratory, Fisher Body Division - G.M.C. In an era of shrinking lead time and increasing demand for quality, the adhesives and sealants of the 80's provide new challenges for the Automotive Materials Engineer. The paper offers a few ideas to the Materials Engineer 820488 (and his management) for meeting these challenges. 820486. Development and properties of BethStar 80, a new 80 ksi yield strength HSLA plate. Halle Abrams and P. R. Slimmon, Research De- partment, Bethlehem Steel Corp., Bethlehem, PA. This paper describes the development and mechanical properties of Bethlehem's new 80,000 psi minimum yield strength light-gage plate grade, BethStar 80. This material is available in thicknesses from 3/16 to 5/8 inch and lengths up to 780 inches, with widths to 90 inches depending on the thickness. Data on strength, toughness, fatigue, formability, strain aging, and welding demon- strate the outstanding mechanical properties of BethStar 80 plate as compared with alternate competitive materials. The combination of a low-carbon, low-sulfur, micro- alloyed (VCb) steel and computer control-rolled proc- essing provides a uniform plate with exceptional me- chanical properties. Microstructural studies show that the excellent bal- ance of mechanical properties is due to significant grain refinement (a grain size of ~4 microns or less/ASTM equivalent number of &gt;12.5), precipitation hardening, and some degree of substructure development. The general microstructure is ferrite/pearlite, with less than 10% bainite plus martensite being observed in the heavier-thickness plates. 820487.

Brueck, Formerly affiliated with Iowa State Univ., Ames, IA. A mathematical model for a two-stage pressure reducing valve connected to a constant pressure supply circuit and a resistance type hydraulic load has been developed. This model can be used for obtaining an optimum design for this kind of valve. A commercial valve (Rivett Model P88-37-93-3/8") was tested for experimental verification of the model. Computer programs were used to simulate the static and dynamic operation of the valve. Both simulation results and experimental data showed de- creases in the reduced pressure drop at high flow rates and fast reduced pressure response to a step input. The speed of response was found to depend on the damping at the 87</page><page sequence="69">820488 poppet stage. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820489. The development of I.S.O. braking standards.

Genesis of the maintenance-free belt. Tetsuo Orito, Bando Chemical Industries (Japan). Automotive V-belts have the important function of transferring the crankshaft rotation to the auxilliary systems. These auxilliary systems are comprised of alternator, fan, water pump, power steering, cooler, etc. Thus, in the last few years the following two require- ments have become important in regard to automotive V-belts: 1) The belt tension should remain stable retaining its load transmission capacity for a long time period without it being necessary to retension the belt. 2) The actual service life of the belt should be lengthened, and belt reliability should be increased. In regard to item (1) above, the 1980 California Standard (CARB) stated that belts should provide 30,000 miles maintenance-free service (Finally, at the request of the American belt manufacturers, the requirement was changed to one adjustment in 30,000 miles). Furthermore, the 1982 Bill being prepared mentions 50,000 miles maintenance-free operation and 100,000 miles service life. Bando Chemical Industries Co. Ltd. undertook a detailed investigation of belts used so far in order to establish the conditions necessary for a belt to clear the 30,000 miles maintenance-free requirement, and the 50,000 miles service life requirement. The result is a uniquely innovative maintenance-free belt. 820491. Design, finite modeling and structural perform- ance of a one-piece SMC auto hood. D. L. Schweikert and R. W. Allan, Owens-Corning Fiberglas. In response to identified industry needs for lightweight materials, Owens-Corning Fiberglas initiated a concen- trated two-year program to advance the use of SMC technology. A project center was established utilizing Owens-Corning personnel from a variety of scientific disciplines including reinforcement development, resin development, mold design, design and structural analysis, production molding, machine technology and physical testing and mechanical testing. Its objective is to over- come concerns about cost and performance for appli- cations requiring critical Class "A" finishes. Advances in SMC technology will be aimed at improving reproduci- bility, finish and production costs. The project will also develop data that will add to the characterization of SMC properties. As a proof statement, the project center is developing, from initial design through limited production of parts, a one-piece automotive hood. 820493. Predicting creep of RIM and RRIM materials. Rahul Mukerjee, Davidson Rubber Div:, Ex- Cell-O Corp., Dover, NH. The objective of this paper is to present methods for characterizing creep behavior of plastics, in particular, RIM and RRIM materials, using short term testing. The two modes of creep testing discussed are flexural and compressive creep. The techniques were developed based on work with RIM and RRIM materials and provide a quick, accurate way to compare creep behavior and modulus decay for low and high modulus plastics. 820494. Effectiveness of polyurethane foam in energy absorbing structures. B. E. Lampinen and R. A. Jeryan, Ford Motor Co. Future vehicle safety, performance and fuel economy objectives make the development of new materials, concepts and methods of crash energy management desirable. The technique of foam filling structural rails for increased energy absorption was investigated as one such concept. A fractional factorial test program was established to evaluate the weight effectiveness of polyurethane foam as an energy absorber and stabilizer. The experiment provided the quantitative effects of design parameter, variability of results and statistical significance of each parameter with regard to crash characteristics. High density foam was found to be weight effective as a structural reinforcement, but not as an energy absorber. Medium density foam improves the energy absorption of a section. Equivalent energy, however, can be absorbed more weight effectively by changing the metal thickness or the section size. Low density foam proved to be weight ineffective as an energy absorber in typical automotive structures. Regression models were developed which reasonably predict the load capacity and axial collapse of the foam-filled sections. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820495. S cam and shoe roller contact point: an iteration procedure. William R. Miller and James L. Bailey, The University of Toledo.; and Ray- mond M. Scanion, C &amp; M Axle, Dana Corp. The determination of the points of contact between an S cam and brake shoe rollers cannot be determined explicitly by mathematical methods. An iteration pro- cedure is developed which allows the points of contact to be determined for any cam -rotation. A mathematical 88</page><page sequence="70">proof is given which verifies the iteration procedure for one of the two cases examined. Examples for a brake are worked out which show how the iteration procedure converges on the actual contact points. 820496. The development of the new generation Fuller transmissions. Robert Denes, Transmission Div., Eaton Corp. The four year transmission development program brought to production forty models for medium and heavy trucks. The three phase program incorporated: a) Experimental testing, b) Design verification testing, and c) Product verification testing. The new models, based on the building block principle, have an increased life and reliability, and a greatly reduced noise emission level. All models were in production by the end of 1981. 820497. Diesel-ethanol fuel blends for heavy duty diesel engines- a study of performance and durability. I. Hashimoto, H. Nakashima, and K. Komiyama, Komatsu Ltd.; Y. Maeda and H. Hamaguchi, Nippon Mining Co., Ltd.; and M. Endo and H. Nishi, Showa Oil Co. A study of "diesohol" - ethanol blended with diesel fuel - was made for both pre-chamber type and open- chamber type heavy duty diesel engines. Performance tests were conducted to evaluate changes in power, fuel consumption, smoke and exhaust emissions for diesel fuel and blends of 10% and 20% ethanol. The open-chamber type engine fueled by 20% diesohol was subjected to a 500 hour durability test. Oil deterioration, wear of parts etc. were measured and promising results were found. 820499. Engine hydrocarbon concentration measurements: a comparison between a sampling probe and raman spectroscopy. Sheridan C. Johnston and Robert M. Green, Sandia National Laborato- ries, Livermore, CA. An experiment designed to quantify probe-induced aerodynamic perturbations to in-cylinder sampling meas- urements in a motored engine is discussed. Good agree- ment was observed between concentration measurements obtained with a sampling probe utilizing a flame ioni- zation detector and those obtained by laser Raman scattering at the probe tip. However, large differences were found between the Raman-measured concentration profiles obtained with and without the probe installed in the engine. These differences occurred because of probe- induced perturbations to the in-cylinder air motion which decreased the mean velocity and increased local mixing rates. Effects due to probe orientation in the flow, probe insertion depth, probe inflow, and far-field flow pertur- bations are reported. SAE Trans ., Vol. 91 820500. Combustion system component design of a high speed small D.I. diesel engine. Ryoji Kihara and Motoyasu Kinbara, Isuzu Motors Ltd. (Japan). The following features of a small high-speed DI engine are 820503 counterplans of unsuitable changes in the engine per- formance occurring in DI engine down-sizing and in the increasing of engine speed. The features differ in each design of the gasket, the piston, the nozzle and the nozzle holder from the conventional diesel design technology. These features can raise the engine performance of small engines up to the level of large engines. 820501. Temperature controlled engine valves. R. P. Worthen and T. N. Tunnecliffe, Eaton Corp. Experimental test and theoretical analysis have been used to identify diesel engine valve heat flow in both conven- tional intake and exhaust valves and in metallic heat barrier intake and exhaust valves. Significant changes in valve surface temperature both on the intake fillet region and on the valve head have been achieved. A quasi-steady state finite element heat transfer analysis has been used to define heat flow by matching experimentally measured temperatures and temperature profiles. Heat flow on the intake valve fillet region has been changed with up to 90 percent blocked. Fifty percent of#the heat flow from the combustion chamber side of the valve has been blocked with advance techniques promising 75% blockage. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820502. Injection pump applications consideration. Thom- as D. Hess, Director of Current Product Engi- neering, Stanadyne Diesel Systems Group, Hart- ford, CT. The initial design of the Model DB2 fuel injection pump has served as a basis for continued development. The modifications required by three new engines (small industrial, passenger car and truck - 4, 6 and 8 cylinders respectively) introduced in 1981 provide a good example of this. The major changes involved the pump mounting areas, the throttle designs, and fuel controls. Also, more stringent durability requirements had to be met in respect to higher temperatures and duty cycles. As a result, the DB2 now offers greater capability towards future applications. 820503. Trends in diesel engine charge air cooling. R. R. Sekar, Cummins Engine Co., Columbus, IN. Demand for higher specific output from diesel engines has resulted in virtually all heavy duty engines being tur- bocharged. To obtain further increases in specific output, turbocharged engines can be coupled with a charge air cooling system. All major engine manufacturers now offer at least some models employing charge air coolers. The favorable impacts of charge air cooling on fuel con- sumption, emissions, altitude performance, thermal load- ing of engine components and the capability for higher specific output have encouraged several investigators to undertake in-depth studies of optimum charge air cooling system. This paper reviews the evolution and trends in charge air cooling systems. The advantages and concerns con- nected with the various methods are discussed. Some test 89</page><page sequence="71">820503 and analytical results of the effect of charge air cooling on various engine performance parameters are presented. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820504. Heat transfer and stress analyses of engine heads and evaluation of methods of preventing head cracks. J. J. Blech, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel. The problem of engine head thermal stresses which may cause its cracking is discussed in both quantitative terms and in the methods of crack circumvention. It is pointed out that in the present state of the art only scarce knowledge exists on thermal boundary conditions in both the combustion chamber and in the coolant side. Effective relieving schemes include cylinders decoupling and introduction of thermal barriers. The need is pointed out for further research in augmentation of heat transfer schemes on the coolant side. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820505. Piston design for high combustion pressures and reduced heat rejection to coolant. Erich Wacker and Wilfried Sander, Karl Schmidt GmbH. As an alternative to the standard aluminum piston construction a gallery cooled one piece (so called Monobloc) spheroidal graphite cast iron piston has been developed for use in heavy duty Diesel engines. It allows for 3000 psi (207 bar) combustion pressure. Due to about 180 F (100° C) higher average crown surface temperature it takes less heat from the combustion chamber. A further reduction of the heat loss to the coolant can be obtained by an uncooled, composite piston. Based on a 2- dimensional FEM analysis a reduction of 60% is predicted for a design with metal top. A ceramic top does not promise a significantly greater effect. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820506. The effects of manufacturing tolerances and fillet radii on stresses in the cylinder block liner support area. James E. Crosheck, John Deere Product Engineering Center. The supporting flange for a wet liner in a diesel engine was analyzed. The results show that stresses can vary as much due to manufacturing tolerance bands as due to major dimensional changes in the joint area. Guidelines have been developed for selecting fillet radii and for the size and shape of the contact area between the liner and block. Further, the paper shows that analytical methods can be used to aid the designer in determining not only the basic dimensions but also the tolerances. The analyt- ical techniques also allow "trial and error" comparison of slight variations in design more easily than by testing. Detail evaluation can be accomplished with this analytical approach that is difficult, if not impossible, to accomplish with available experimental methods. 820507. Mounting design for rotary pumps. G. P. Balfour, Lucas Industries, Noise Centre, London, Eng- land. The emergence of high speed diesel engines for cars has emphasized the problems of mounting fuel injection pumps onto engines. Some engine manufacturers are using sheet steel pressings or thin cast brackets which allow the pump to vibrate in resonance in the engine firing frequency range. This increases the likelihood of failure of these brackets in service due to metal fatigue. A theo- retical analysis of a simple bracket enables the essentials of the problem to be understood and it allows possible design solutions to be evaluated. This theoretical analysis is complemented by experimental evidence from actual brackets. 820508. (P-106) Maximum-conjugacy gearing. Yoshito Watanabe, Nissan Diesel Motor Company, Ltd. (Japan).; and W. S. Rouverol, Rolling Contact Gear Company. Gear tooth characteristics that minimize noise excitation are identified, and a new "Maximum-Conjugacy" tooth form is described that employs these characteristics to reduce gear noise excitation to approximately 15% of that of conventional gearing. Kinematic action, relative torque capacity, and comparative manufacturing costs are dis- cussed. Noise reductions obtained from employing the new gearing in the timing train of a small diesel engine are evaluated for the full range of engine speeds. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820511. Oil-film thickness in a bearing of a fired engine. M. S. Filowitz, W. H. King, and J. K. Appel- doorn, Exxon Research and Engineering Com- pany. Relative oil-film thickness has been measured in a main bearing of a fired, single-cylinder CLR engine. The bearing is electrically insulated from the block and a small voltage impressed between the bearing and crankshaft. When film thickness becomes less than a critical value, a series of electrical discharges occurs. The relative film thickness is determined by the extent of the electrical discharge. Relative film thickness was found to increase with speed and viscosity and decrease with load as predicted from the Sommerfeld parameter. Oils containing V.l. improvers gave thinner oil films than predicted by their low-shear viscosity, but slightly thicker films than pre- dicted by their high-shear viscosity. One oil, containing a low molecular weight polymer, was even better than its low-shear viscosity Newtonian counterpart. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820514. An automatic IC brightness controller for display systems. Robert S. Stricklin, Jr. and William V. Hoff, TRW Optron.; and John M. Witoszynski, TRW Electronic Components Group. Sophisticated electronic displays represent a growing trend in U.S. car instrumentation. One location, single function displays, such as digital clock, radio, or instru- ment cluster, are giving way to multiple function displays located across the instrument panel. The large dynamic 90</page><page sequence="72">range of light levels in vehicles establishes the need for some type of real time light controlling system. TRW Optron has developed a monolithic IC approach to this problem. This paper describes that development and illustrates various techniques available to the design engineer developing a system for dynamic brightness control. 820515. (SP-51 1) High reliability semiconductor pressure sensor for automobiles. Tomoji Inui and Hitoshi Minorikawa, Sawa Works, Hitachi Ltd.; and Motohisa Nishihara, Hitachi Res. Lab., Hitachi, Ltd. We have developed the high accuracy and high reliability semiconductor pressure sensor for measuring intake manifold pressure and atmospheric pressure. Its heart is composed of a 3 X 3 mm silicon diaphragm chip, four piezoresistors being diffused and connected to a Wheat- stone bridge. Hereupon, the silicon crystal plane, axis, diaphragm configuration, and piezoresistor positions are optimumly designed, being based on the stress analysis of the diaphragm. It features the selection of the octagonal diaphragm and not the round or square one used in general. Its output is around 50 mV/80 kPa and is affected by ambient temperature. So, it was not only amplified, but temperature-compensated for by the unique hybrid IC circuit with thermistors. As a result, we have realized temperature characteristics within a ± 1.5% error of F.S. (80 kPa) at 0°C ~ +85°C and ±3% F.S. at -40°C - + 125°C. On the other hand, we conducted various kinds of durability tests in operating conditions including pressure and temperature cycling of -85 kPa &lt;-» + 100 kPa, - 40°C &lt;-&gt; + 130°C, humidity of 85°C, 85% RH, liquid, vibration, and as a result the reliability has been proven to be satisfactory for automobiles. Moreover, it features this sensor being protected from EMI (Electro-Magnetic Interference). Our differential pressure sensor is applied to indicate the manifold pressure, installed in a turbocharged car. An MAP sensor is used for the microcomputer controlled ignition system. In this case, a sensor is small enough, so that it is contained in the control unit, and a barometric pressure sensor for altitude compensation is mounted on a printed circuit board. 820516.

Louisignau, Bendix Corp., Corporate Materials Development Center, Southfield, MI. The sensor glossary presented in this paper was compiled from various standards available to the automotive industry. The glossary was assembled to assist the automotive engineer in the formulation of specifications and test methods. The successful application of sensors in automotive electronic control systems depends on effective commu- 820520 nication between automotive manufacturers and suppli- ers.

The electric drive - an alternative power source for aerial bucket trucks. Jerry Bohlinger, Bohlinger, Inc. The Electric Drive System is one alternative used for powering aerial bucket trucks. Since 1973, Bohlinger Inc. has been manufacturing electric drive systems for the utility industry.

A number of models are manufactured to meet the specific require- ments of the light, medium, and heavy duty aerial bucket truck. 820519. Two-dimensional computations of engine com- bustion: comparisons of measurements and pre- dictions. A. Basso and R. Rinolfi, Centro Ricerche FIAT, Strada Torino (Orbassano/ Italy). Measurements of pressure, flame arrival and wall tem- perature were taken in one cylinder of a four-cylinder production engine. Changed in the experiment were engine speed, load, spark advance, and air-to-fuel ratio for a total of 190 conditions. Then nine cases were selected differing in speed, load, spark advance, and air-to-fuel ratio and their combustion computed with a two- dimensional planar model based on a k-e turbulence sub-model, one overall irreversible reaction for the oxidation of the fuel and the law-of-the-wall and Reyn- olds analogy for wall heat transfer. The same model constants were used in all computations. Computed and measured pressures and flame arrivals were compared and the agreement was judged adequate even though the computed expansion-stroke pressure was somewhat above the measured one in some cases probably due to an underestimate of wall heat losses. The tested model was then used to predict the effect of compression ratio and of a change in chamber geometry on indicated efficiency at 3500 rpm, full load, and stoichiometric mixture. 820520. Managing with statistical methods. James C. Siegel, Manufacturing Staff, Ford Motor Com- pany. The use of statistical management techniques is being 91</page><page sequence="73">820520 rediscovered by American business executives. These techniques, developed in the 1920's, were introduced to Japanese managers in 1950 by an American statistician, Dr. W. Edwards Deming, and Japanese manufacturers credit Deming for much of their productivity and quality improvement success. The control chart is one of the most powerful statistical tools for control of processes. It provides a method of timely, direct communication with a process and allows an accurate assessment of process stability and capability to meet end product requirements. Businesses currently using control charts report direct productivi- ty/quality improvements. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820603. (P-108) Improved chromic acid anodize seal for optimum paint adhesion. Y. Moji, Boeing Mate- rials Technology, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co., Seattle, WA. A new anodize sealing process using a dilute solution of chromic acid and metal chromâtes in deionized water has been developed. Use of this process to seal chromic acid anodize layers gives films that have excellent paint adhesion while maintaining specification requirements for salt-spray corrosion resistance. The extent of hydration is easier to control than with conventional sealing methods and does not require monitoring. Extensive laboratory testing has defined optimum operating parameters. Ex- amination of sealed films using scanning/transmission electron microscopy has elucidated the anodize film structures controlling paint adhesion and corrosion resistance.

Eastern's new plating shop has an uncluttered overhead in the tank areas, all plating lines are in one room, and second floor plating areas are above full access pit areas. The shop has downdraft ventilation, more than one hundred tanks 3 feet x 5 feet and larger, and was built into an existing structure. This was accomplished in a cost effective design which was constructed on time and within budget and which provides a shop that is easy to maintain, monitor, and modify. Special attention was given to meeting environmental regulations. 820607. (P-108) Nichrome clad chromium carbide powder plasma spray coatings. J. D. Reardon, R. Mignogna, and F. N. Longo, Materials Engi- neering Dept., METCO Inc., Westbury, NY. A new chromium carbide/nichrome composite powder has been developed. Unlike the commonly used powder blends, each carbide is clad with a layer of nichrome. Air plasma and low pressure plasma sprayed coatings were compared to conventional coatings from the 25% nichrome/75% chrome carbide blends. Results show that air sprayed coatings from the composite powder have 3 times more abrasive wear resistance than the conventional blend and the abrasive wear resistance of the low pressure sprayed coatings is 4 times that of the blend. Metal- lography and physical properties of chromium car- bide/nichrome coatings will be discussed. 820608. (P-108) New recovery techniques for the chro- mium plating department. Dennis F. Larson, McGean Chemical Co., Inc., Cleveland, OH. Public environmental concern has resulted in federal, state, and local legislation aimed at reducing industrial wastes discharged into our nation's waterways. Conven- tional techniques of controlling chromium discharges relied on the reduction of hexavalent chromium (Cr+6) to a trivalent state (Cr+3) which would form an insoluble hydroxide that could then be precipitated from the waste stream. The net result is a conversion of liquid waste to solid waste. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act with its cradle to grave responsibilities, has encour- aged the development and implementation of methods aimed at reducing losses of valuable raw materials. One such system now allows the plating department to take full advantage of the natural inherent recovery capabilities of rinse tanks for little or no cost at all. SAE Trans- Vol. 91 820609. (P-108) Electroless nickel applications in aircraft maintenance. G. Reinhardt, Engineering Labo- ratories, Eastern Airlines. Characteristics of electroless nickel plating which have provided advantageous application in aircraft mainte- nance operations have included high throwing power resulting in uniform coverage of partially blind areas, close dimensional tolerance control, high hardness con- trollable by heat treatment to provide good wear resis- tance and good corrosion protection. More recently, it has been shown that modern high phosphorous coatings provide improved adherence and strength which severely limited application of earlier electroless nickel coatings. The process has now been approved by an engine manufacturer for optional replacement of electrolytic nickel plating for diffused nickel-cadmium coatings on selected parts. It is the purpose of this paper to review some of the current applications and consider potential new uses for this process. 92</page><page sequence="74">820610.

(P-108) GATOR-GARD® applied coatings ex- tend service lives of critical aerospace compo- nents. Thomas F. Lewis, III, United Technol- ogies Metal Products, Inc., Boynton Beach, FL. A new coating process, GATOR-GARD®, uses a high temperature, high velocity ionized gas to deposit metal or ceramic particles on substrate materials. These uniformly heated particles are deposited at velocities in excess of 4,000 feet per second ensuring a high density, well bonded coating tailored for resistance to wear, erosion, oxidation and sulfidation. The unique structure of GATOR-GARD applied coatings provides the exceptional wear resistance necessary to increase aircraft engine component service lives in particularly harsh environments.

Brush plating is a portable, selective plating process which is capable of on-site repairs and offers a technical and economic alternative to tank plating in many instances. Many applications of brush plating are simple and straightforward, but to take full advantage of its capa- bilities requires conscientious, well trained personnel and some creativity. In the aerospace industry, brush plating and anodizing technology have been used for both production and repair of hardware. 820613. (P-108) Plating on glass for hermetic seal. Jerry E. Jones, Tinker Air Force Base, OK.; and Raymond Daniels and Joe King, Univ. of Oklahoma. A multicomponent, solderable layer, which can be applied to instrument glass, has been developed. The layer consists of an initial coat of SermeTel followed by an electrodeposited zincate, then electroless nickel and finally tin plated. When tested in tension, the interface was found to be more superior in strength than the base material. While this procedure produces an optimal coating, great care must be used in all aspects of production to insure quality and integrity of the interfacial bond. 820614.

Barański, Schwitzer Cooling Systems, Wallace Murray Corp. Aerodynamic calculations are being used to design cooling fans which utilize engine power most efficiently. A computer program is used to perform the complex calculations and to determine the most efficient fan design for a given application. 820621. Diesel engines - designing for the future. R. W. Dugan and J. E. Perry, Cummins Engine Co. Diesel engines of the future will be the designer's response to government regulation, economic restrictions and technological advances. This optimization process will demand adaptability and responsiveness to accelerating change in the business environment. Success will be determined by the degree of understanding of the various interactions. 820622. A review of recent progress in exhaust system design. L. J. Eriksson, Nelson Industries, Inc., Stoughton, WI. Considerable progress has been made in the past several years in the development of improved techniques for exhaust system design. New analytical models now provide an improved understanding of the performance of such important acoustical elements as concentric reso- nators and plug sections. Evaluation techniques utilizing two channel FFT analyzers enable efficient measurement of transmission loss curves for a wide range of silencing designs. These techniques can be used to verify analytical predictions and evaluate the performance of features that are currently difficult to analyze. 820623. Self-lubricating spherical plain bearings for heavy duty applications. T. Shimizu, H. Katsuma, S. Ito, Y. Sawada, and H. Muro, NTN Toyo Bearing Co., Ltd. Recently a demand for maintenance-free is increasing for mechanical components. We have already developed spherical plain bearings fitted with liners for railroad vehicles, which are now used in such places as anti-rolling equipments or longitudinal dampers in the vehicles for The New Tokaido Line. On the other hand, in construc- tion machines or the like, development of a spherical bearing with high impact strength, resistance to high contact pressure and high resistance against muddy water is demanded. Investigations into anti-wear performance as well as creep resistance of various liner materials were made. It was found that polyimide resin with some fillers is the most superior. 820624. Bearing technology advancement as part of industrial progress. Johannes G. W. Braendlein, FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schäfer &amp; Co.; and Walter P. Wieland, FAG Bearings Corp. 93</page><page sequence="75">820624 Rolling bearings of standardized dimensions have proven to be reliable, long-lived structural components in all types of industry. Improved production methods and progressing knowledge in the fields of steel melting and heat treatment of rolling bearing steel resulted in a steady increase of the capacity of rolling bearings. This devel- opment is also reflected by the higher load ratings published recently. The new and advanced development of entire bearing series as well as the development of special bearings made to specifications are of equal importance. Such specially designed bearings opened up many modern and advanced fields of application, for example in space exploration and offshore technology. It can be said that, to date, the rolling bearing technology has fulfilled all requirements. In many cases the use of rolling bearings has resulted in economical overall designs and constructions. A number of examples will show how the development of rolling bearings supports industrial progress. 820626. Analysis of bearing damage. Michael Faultersack, Federal Mogul Corp. Bearing damage mechanisms resulting from non-fatigue modes such as contamination, lack of lubrication, misa- lignment and improper handling are discussed. Included is also a discussion of fatigue modes of bearing damage. Tapered, cylindrical and ball bearings are incorporated into the discussion. 820628. Remote control of vehicle functions. Michael M. Van Schoiack, GLI Corp. (Formerly Grad-Line, Inc.). Since 1975 GLI Corporation has designed and supplied microprocessor based remote control systems for under- ground coal and hardrock mining equipment. Earth moving vehicles can use this technology as it exists today so long as the vehicle does not require more than six proportional, and 15 on/off controls. 820629. Intelligent mobile hydraulics - the logical pro- gression. Brian D. Weber, Pegasus Div. of Koehring Co.; and Raud Wilke, Husco Div. of Koehring Co. The introduction of microcomputer technology into the industrial and consumer marketplaces has contributed to a significant growth in product efficiency, utility, relia- bility, and performance. Combining the intelligence of the microcomputer with the muscle of hydraulics has now greatly enhanced the creativeness of mobile equipment design. Significant strides have already been made with hydraulic excavator applications. Additional excavator advancements are in progress with a number of lattice boom and hydraulic crane developments soon to be accomplished. These current and proposed applications provide the basis for the topic of discussion. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820630. Contaminant removal from compressed air brake systems. Phillip G. Fuerst, Aeroquip Corp. Contaminants such as water vapor, carbon, and oil are present in varying degrees in all compressed air systems of heavy construction equipment. This presentation de- scribes methods of removing these contaminants to reduce the number and severity of problems that may develop in the air brake system. The basic mechanical and ther- modynamic characteristics of compressed air drying are discussed as they relate to dryers, aftercoolers, and other devices available for moisture removal. An analysis of the benefits accrued through contam- inant removal is presented including such topics as reduced corrosion, extension of compressor life, reduced downtime, and elimination of air system freezeup. Mois- ture expelling devices such as aftercoolers, heat exchang- ers, and expulsion valves are compared to and contrasted with state-of-the-art air dryers. 820633. Influence of various material factors of one percent chromium carburizing steel upon rolling contact fatigue life. N. Tsushima, I. Sugiura, and H. Muro, NTN Toyo Bearing Co., Ltd. Chromium and chromium-molybdenum carburizing steels are widely used for small- and medium-sized rolling bearings or gears, in Japan. Using a cylinder-to-ball type rolling contact fatigue rig, influence of various material factors such as chemical compositions, oxygen content, retained austenite and grain size in 1% chromium carburizing steel was investigated. Life level of 1% chromium steel has been increased gradually since 1968 when the test began. The increase in Ufe level is mainly due to reduction in oxygen content by the improvement of steel-making technique. Manganese content increases the life and 1% Cr steel with 1% Mn has high reliable life. Prior austenite grain size does not seem to influence the rolling contact fatigue life. 820634. A method for bearing damage analysis. Craig V. Darragh, The Timken Co. A method for the analysis of a damaged bearing is described. An emphasis is placed on obtaining complete and accurate application information; conducting a thorough visual examination; making physical measure- ments as necessary; and conducting metallurgical tests. The method has been used for tapered roller bearings as well as a variety of other components of various steel types and processing histories. 820635. Finite element analysis of thrust races with nonuniform loading. Chris Robinson, The Tor- rington Co., Torrington, CT. The contact fatigue life of a roller thrust bearing depends on the roller load distribution, which is dependent on the shape of the raceway surfaces under load. This presen- tation will show a finite element method of calculating the deflections of ą partially backed up thrust race with nonuniform loading. This loading can be the result of an eccentric thrust load, or nonparallel raceway surfaces. A brief discussion of the theory will be presented along with a typical application. 94</page><page sequence="76">820636. A cartridge type pivotal pin and bushing joint. Gerald L. Granda, Mid-States Sales Co. A cartridge type pivotal pin and bushing joint has been patented and is being tested and refined both in the laboratory and on construction machinery. It features "dry lubricated" (Teflon) bearings which are assembled and sealed prior to installation. It is suitable for heavy unit loads and use under severe wear conditions, such as in crawler track chains and loader bucket pivotal pin joints. A brief history of U.S. manufactured track pin joints is included to show the progress in extending the service life of these devices. 820637. Measuring reliability. J. W. Krutulis, Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of General Motor Corporation. Reliability is an important performance parameter often referred to subjectively in terms such as "high reliability" but seldom measured or verified. This results from one or both of the following reasons: o Measurement of reliability occurs over a long time span. Measuring reliability in the user environment can require months or years of operating history; whereas, acceleration, turning radius, and other performance parameters can be measured with a short term controlled experiment. Without immediate results, diligence in data monitoring often deteriorates until data value is ques- tionable. o There is a false notion that complex statistical techniques are necessary to make usable estimates of reliability levels and patterns. A process is proposed in this paper whereby users, distributors, or manufacturers can quantitatively measure reliability in the user environment. This would form a basis for the communication of factual information about reliability between the user and manufacturer. Key elements of this process are: control of information, simplicity of calculations, and action based on results of the reliability measurement. SAE Trans ., Vol. 91 820638. Hydrostatic transmission reliability from design to application. Edward L. Stout, Hydro-Transmis- sion Div., Sundstrand Corp.

Automatic blade controls for eartbmoving ma- chines. Yuji Essaki, Jiro Chiba, Tetsuji Funa- bashi, and Shunichi Hayakawa, Electro-Me- chanical Engineering Center, Komatsu Ltd., Kanagawa, Japan. The accuracy demanded for the finished surface of leveling operations is becoming more severe each year. To cope with this demand, new type automatic blade control system (Laser type ABC system) for earthmoving ma- 820643 chines have been developed. To realize the most suitable system for machines equipped with automatic controls, and most of com- ponents including sensors have developed in our engi- neering center. By adopting this system, the operator's blade adjusting work has been significantly reduced. Operation can be performed at speeds up to 10 km/hr, and the accuracy of finished surface can be obtained within ±2 cm. 820641. Engineering plastics components in construction equipment. John H. Chen and Robert A. Al- berts, The Polymer Corp., Reading, PA. Engineering plastics, which offer multiple high perform- ance properties for heavy duty components are explained by molecular structure of high polymers. Technological behavior, which is unique to polymers, including friction, wear, fatigue resistance, contact pres- sure reduction, temperature and time dependency elu- cidate their functions as machine parts. Design criteria and fabrication characteristics of plastic parts are illustrated and exemplified as wear pads, seal rings, bearing bushings, sheaves, tubing, hydraulic hoses and functional coatings presently used in construc- tion industries. 820642. Current and future plate steels for construction machinery. G. J. Roe, Steel Operations, Beth- lehem Steel Corp., Bethlehem, PA. The processing, compositions, properties and strength- ening mechanisms of the high-strength low-alloy plate grades are summarized. In the as-rolled condition these plate grades can have yield strengths to 80,000 psi. In a quenched and tempered condition both 100,000 psi yield strengths and abrasion resistant grades are available. New improvements in toughness, weldability and formability can be obtained primarily through steel desulfurization and sulfide shape control. % 820643. High-performance, high-aluminum zinc alloys for low-speed bearings and bushings. Tony Calayag and Dean Ferres, Kidd Creek Mines Ltd. The purpose of this paper is to describe the advantages and validity of substituting the high-performance zinc casting alloys, ZA- 12 and ZA-27, for bronze in selected low-speed, medium temperature bearing and bushing applications. Because the cost per unit volume of ZA- 12 and ZA-27 is less than half that of SAE 660 bronze, these zinc alloys will provide major cost savings in the OEM and replace- ment markets whenever they equal or exceed bronze performance on the selected applications. For the foundry, these alloys offer significant advan- tages over bronze: lower energy requirements, no de- pendency on tin (a strategic material), and no pollution problems common to the leaded bearing bronzes. With a natural lubricity and hardnesses exceeding those of 660 bronze, the properties of ZA- 12 and ZA-27 alloys indicate good bearing potential. This has been 95</page><page sequence="77">820643 confirmed by laboratory tests conducted by the Battelle Institute under the auspices of ILZRO and in field tests conducted by Kidd Creek Mines, Ltd. (formerly Texasgulf Metals Company). History, property data, laboratory data, and field experience will be presented, along with guidelines for applying the zinc alloys to bearing applications. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820644. Design guidelines for serviceable machines. Robert A. Johanningmeier, John Deere Indus- trial Equipment Div., Product Engineering Cen- ter. Maintenance and repair costs are a major part of total operating costs on off-highway equipment. Because of this, more emphasis must be placed in these areas during the design process. Reviewing the actual hardware and judging acceptability/unacceptability on the basis of current production counterparts or studies on competitive machines is not adequate. Ease of maintenance and repair must be considered in detail very early in the design process, preferably the feasibility phase, and reevaluated as the design matures thru to production and after. The following offers guidance as to how this can be done. 820645. Contractors and manufacturers - partners in computerized equipment management. Robert L. Nelson, Elke Corp., Golden Valley, MN. An amazing number of both large and small companies do not have an adequate equipment maintenance man- agement system. A conservative estimate indicates that at least 70% of American equipment-related businesses do not have adequate predictive maintenance programs. On a nationwide scale, a change is needed from a wasteful throw-away society to a maintenance conscious nation protecting our resources. To remain competitive, all companies need improved maintenance to achieve their production schedules and to protect their equipment investments. Substantial equipment operating cost savings can be realized through more efficient equipment management. These savings are available to all companies progressive enough to use computers to modernize their equipment management and maintenance operations. 820646. Trends in extended interval maintenance earthmoving and construction machinery. Rudolph Lenich, Caterpillar Tractor Co. An SAE recommended practice lists recommended inter- vals from 10 to 5000 hours for use in establishing maintenance intervals for earthmoving and construction machinery. Except for some "lifetime" lubricated items, the user has had some difficulty in handling maintenance logistics so as to capitalize on the infrequent interval. The most frequent interval has generally set the common interval for all machines in a fleet, irrespective of make or vintage. Past experience, manufacturer and user dilem- mas, future trends, and prospects for significant change are discussed. 820647. Field compatible NOx emission measurement technique. M. S. Englund, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A simple and feasible approach to the measurement of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) from internal combustion engines is to collect engine exhaust in bags and subse- quently analyze the samples with conventional laboratory equipment. The measurement technique that was devel- oped for this purpose incorporates a portable apparatus for collecting bag samples and fuel specific NOx emission calculation methods outlined in the July 23, 1979, Federal Register, Stationary Internal Combustion Engines-Pro- posed Rules. 820649. Contaminant effects on electrohydraulic control valves. Riichi Inoue, Fluid Power Research Center. Solenoid and proportional control valves are two major types of electrohydraulic control valves that have been widely used in industry. Experimental tests were con- ducted to study the effect of contaminant on these valves. Test results demonstrate that contaminant drastically changes the performance characteristics of electrohy- draulic control valves and leads to a catastrophic failure. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820650. Solenoid cartridge valves used in earth moving equipment. Louis C. Harms, Fluid Power Sys- tems Div., United Technologies Corp., Wheel- ing, IL. Electro/Hydraulic Cartridge Style Directional control valves are helping to meet the design objectives of increased productivity, reliability and serviceability of todays mobile equipment. These compact screw-in type 2 Way, 3 Way, and 4 Way valves are presently being used on a variety of construction equipment which include Motor Graders, Excavators, Scrapers and Front-End Loaders. They are used in pilot control circuits for shifting large valves, transmission shift controls, Hi-Low speed circuits, in addition to clutch and differential lock functions. Typically these valves are installed in a form drilled and tapped cavity which is machined into a valve housing. Solenoid cartridge valves and other valving components installed in multi-drilled bodies provide a complete self-contained hydraulic circuit. This paper describes these valves and the various applications involving the cartridge valve concept. 820651. An electrohydraulic remote proportionally con- trolled pump and a productive application on an asphalt paver. Kenneth F. Frank, Dynex/Rivett Inc., Pewaukee, WI. Remote controllability of hydraulic components broadens their range of application. Remote controls on variable volume pumps range from simple manual linkages and cables to more sophisticated controls, such as load-sensing or electrohydraulic proportional control. This paper will discuss the Dynex/Rivett variable 96</page><page sequence="78">volume pump with an integral electrohydraulic remotely controlled stroking device, used in combination with a choice of pressure controls. It will also discuss the closed-loop application of this pump on an asphalt paver. By using electronically closed-loop control logic, the paver is able to provide a mat of more consistent quality and density. The electrohydraulic control package on this pump acts as the interface between the high intelligence capability of the electronics and the high horsepower capability of the hydraulics. 820652. Designing rotational molded plastic components for earth moving equipment. Larry Snyder and Richard Florer, Snyder Industries. The application of roto molding technology toward the design of Earth Moving Equipment components is discussed. Design guidelines to utilize rotational molding' s unique ability to produce relatively stress free hollow parts of complex configuration are presented. Examples of fuel cells and hydraulic reservoirs, applicable to earth moving equipment requirements are shown to illustrate correct application of roto molding design criteria. 820653. Structural designs with foamahle engineering resins. John M. Jula, Structural Foam Resins Section, Plastics Operations, General Electric Co. Design problems in the agricultural/off-highway segment of the transportation industry often stem from this dilemma: make vehicles perform better, but at no cost penalty. One solution is the engineering structural foam process. This process produces large, stress-free parts, with no sink marks and with molded-in function. Compared to metal, the engineering structural foam process offers greater design freedom, eliminates secondary labor, and parts will not rust or corrode. This paper will examine these, and other advantages, of this emerging plastics technology. 820654. Reaction injection molding. George D. Lewis, Union Carbide Corp., Danbury, CT. Reaction Injection Molding is a relatively new plastics processing technology that has grown rapidly in the past few years. The processing advantages of RIM for molding large parts are significant, and are expected to lead to its increasing acceptance for a variety of applications. 820655. Tracked vehicle tractive performance prediction - a case study in understanding the soil/tool interface. Scott E. Rohrbach and George J. Jackson, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A method of predicting the tractive performance of a tracked vehicle has been developed through a combined program of analytical modeling, field testing and model verification. This method uses field test data to establish parameters that describe the track/soil interface. Once these parameters are established, the analytical model can then predict changes in tractive performance resulting from changes in vehicle configuration and operating conditions. 820676 820656. Soil dynamics: a review of theory and application. R. D. Wismer, Deere &amp; Company, Technical Center, Moline, IL. Soil dynamics is defined as a special body of scientific knowledge that deals with the high rate of strain and resulting large strain failure of off-highway vehicles interacting with soil. The development of soil dynamics knowledge is traced from its origin in classical soil mechanics and foundation engineering to the current practical engineering capability for the design, devel- opment and utilization of off-highway machines. Exam- ples of research results and engineering applications in traction, tillage and earthmoving are presented and discussed. Although soil dynamics research can lead to the creation of radically new and different machines, it is concluded that its greatest impact on off-highway ma- chinery is in design optimization and evaluation. The combination of improved measurement and computa- tional systems assure continued growth of soil dynamics knowledge and engineering capability in an evolutionary way. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820660. A pattern for engineers in the Ws. W. J. Lux, John Deere Industrial Equipment Product En- gineering Center, G. Edwin Burks Lecture. The material presented in this paper addresses the following questions of the engineer of the '80's: 1. How can an (earthmoving) engineer be successful in the '80's? 2. Should he isolate himself in his work? 3. Are there special needs in the '80's? 4. What should he do - personally - to succeed and to improve the world in which we live? 5. Can the engineer help solve specific problems facing us now? 6. Can today's problems - unemployment, inflation, world unrest, competition from new sources around the world, social unrest, energy limitations, pollution, and others, be met directly by the engineer with any success?

Tighe, Truck Operations, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. This paper provides an overview of some design processes emphasizing fatigue considerations for suspension system components. Two-suspension components used on the new Ford Ranger Pickup truck have been selected as illustrations. Emphasis is placed on the use of non-linear, dynamic modeling as a tool for designing vehicles to exceed customer fatigue requirements. This paper is intended to preceed a series of special- ized papers on specific aspects of fatigue as a part of the SAE Fatigue Conference April, 1982. It is intended to discuss some analytical tools available to the engineer and 97</page><page sequence="79">820676 some specific examples of how components of a suspen- sion system may be engineered to survive in normal service environments and to meet customer expectations. 820677. (P-109) Fundamentals of fatigue analysis. R. W. Landgraf, Engineering &amp; Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. An overview of the basic concepts involved in performing a fatigue analysis is presented as an introduction to a series of specialized papers dealing with the development of fatigue information and its use in engineering design. Following a brief account of the fatigue process and failure definition, methods for describing fatigue resis- tance are discussed. Cumulative damage concepts based on fatigue life curves are then demonstrated. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820678. (P-109) Demonstration of fatigue life calcula- tions. Thomas M. Johnson, General Motors Proving Ground, Milford, MI. The purpose of this demonstration is to simulate many of the operations involved in an actual fatigue life calcu- lation exercise. A "component" will be "manufactured" from "raw materials." A "service environment" will be defined and an "S/N" curve will be developed for the component. "Material Characteristics" will be empirically defined, and fatigue life calculations will be made using several techniques. Actual "component fatigue tests" will be conducted and compared with calculated fatigue lives. Attempts will be made to introduce much of the jargon and vocabulary used in fatigue life analysis. 820679. (P-109) Monotonie and fatigue characterizations of metals. N. R. LaPointe, Test Operations and Engrg. Services Ofc., Ford Motor Co. Monotonie and cyclic properties for metals are reviewed. Conventional stress based fatigue characterizations of S-N curves and mean stress plots are illustrated. Strain based mechanical hysteresis concepts are used to express cyclic stress-strain properties, and fatigue properties when combined with fatigue life data. These properties are useful for a computer based materials data file for engineering applications. Cyclic deformation behavior for cyclic creep and stress relaxation is illustrated. A fatigue notch characterization is given based upon Neuber's Rule. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820680. (P-109) Fracture mechanics and fracture control - a synopsis for ground-vehicle usage. A. K. Shoemaker, U.S. Steel Research Laboratory, Monroeville, PA. An overview is given of the fracture mechanics meth- odologies for determining quantitative assessment of fatigue crack initiation, fatigue crack propagation, and final fracture of welded structural components. Most of the fatigue life of weldments is spent in propagating a crack to a critical size resulting in unstable fractures. Of particular significance to the designer is the realization that the fatigue crack growth rate is similar for all steels independent of strength level, toughness or microstruc- ture. . SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820681. (P-109) Property and processing comparisons: a guide to selection and trade-offs. A. R. Krause, Ford Motor Co., Engineering and Research Staff, Dearborn, MI. Fatigue properties of sheet steels are examined beginning with a brief overview of the more common strengthening mechanisms used in the manufacturing and processing of sheet products. Cyclic and monotonie flow properties are reviewed with a particular emphasis on processing variables. Strength ductility trade-offs for sheet steels are discussed and several alloy steels are presented in terms of a Neuberlife cure. The fatigue of cast iron is approached as an internally flawed material. Fatigue life predictions are made by comparing the response of similar structure and compo- sition cast steel to that of cast iron and then applying a Neuber analysis to the results. Fatigue results are given for both non-heat-treatable and heat-treatable aluminum alloys. Finally, the role of residual stresses induced by surface treatments is discussed. The area is divided into metal- lurgically induced stresses such as those obtained from case hardening and mechanically induced stress from a process such as shot peening. 820682. (P-109) Crack initiation fatigue - data, analysis, trends and estimation. Bruce E. Boardman, Deere &amp; Company Technical Center, Moline, IL. From the first documentation of fatigue by Albert (1829), through the recognition of a cyclic stress versus life relationship by Bauschinger (1886), to the understanding of plastic strain versus life considerations by Coffin and Manson (1955), there has been a steady growth in the ability to understand and use fatigue design principles. Morrow and his colleagues, have been instrumental in further upgrading the state-of-the-art by presenting techniques for the application of strain-controlled fatigue analysis. One handicap which still remains is the avail- ability of validated, reliable data on materials. This paper presents a summary of fatigue properties for steels common to the ground vehicle industry and their literature references. There is discussion of several errors which can occur by applying statistical analysis or accepting reported fatigue properties without a critical review of the results. Techniques are shown for estimating the fatigue properties when no data exists or as one step in the validation process for statistically determined or reported data. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820683.

Hoeppner, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Univ. of Toronto, Toronto, Ontar- io. Corrosion and fretting are two time dependent processes that frequently can result in either a significant fatigue life reduction or a significant stress allowable reduction when they occur conjointly with cyclic loads. Both of these processes acting alone can have a significant effect on the functional capability, performance, and structural integ- rity as well as the appearance. When acting in conjunction with cyclic loads, it is possible that cracks nucleate in regions of either corrosion damage or fretting damage or both. Thus, steps frequently must be taken to prevent either corrosion or fretting - especially if a "no-crack" design philosophy is employed. Frequently, subsequent to crack nucleation in either the corrosion or fretting damage areas, the stress intensity is high enough to propagate the cracks. The nature of the environment and contact conditions in consort with the 820690 local strain (stress) may also cause the crack propagation to be significantly accelerated as well. Thus, the possibility of environmentally assisted fatigue crack propagation must be considered in a damage-tolerant fatigue design. In formulating the detailed fatigue analysis and testing to provide input to the fatigue design methodology, it thus becomes extremely important to consider the potential for corrosion and/or fretting to occur. These potentially deleterious processes frequently occur at local geometric discontinuities (e.g. notches) and/or joints of all types. Thus, they become extremely important. If they occur, they can produce cracks when no cracks can be tolerated. Or, where cracks occur, the environment and/or contact conditions may accelerate the propagation of cracks by the cyclic loads. This paper presents a brief introduction to both the corrosion (fatigue) and fretting (fatigue) processes. The potential effect of these phenomena on fatigue integrity is discussed. Methods of anticipating, preventing, allevi- ating, or estimating fatigue life are discussed in relation to maintaining the desired component integrity related to the overall design philosophy. 820688. (P-109) Constant amplitude fatigue life assess- ment models. Harold S. Reemsnyder, Research Dept., Bethlehem Steel Corp., Bethlehem, PA. The applications of the stress-life, local strain, linear elastic fracture mechanics, and component test models to the prediction of constant amplitude fatigue life are reviewed. Predictions of cycles to crack initiation in a component by the stress-life and local strain models are illustrated by examples and compared to results of tests on the component. Estimation of the cycles of crack prop- agation to fracture of the component is demonstrated by an example of the application of linear elastic fracture mechanics. The prediction of the total life of a component by a combination of the local strain and fracture mechanics models is discussed and illustrated. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820689.

(P-109) A discussion of methods for estimating fatigue life. N. E. Dowling, Westinghouse R&amp;D Center, Pittsburgh, PA. Various methods for estimating fatigue life for machine or structural components are compared and discussed. Guidelines are offered to aid in choosing methods or combinations of methods for particular situations, such as different stages of design. The methods discussed include those based on local strain, nominal stress, component test data, and fracture mechanics. It is noted that the exact choice of a method or variation of a method may be an unimportant detail when one considers the uncertainties which often exist as to the actual load history in service or the time dependent effects of a hostile environment. Also, it is important to make maximum use of any component test data or service experience data which are available. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820692. (P-109) Theoretical fatigue life prediction using the cumulative damage approach. Eugene B. Loverich, College of Engineering &amp; Technology, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ. A method is presented for conservatively estimating a total fatigue life through a prediction of crack initiation life using the cumulative damage approach. The proce- dure is based upon the use of Neuber's Rule, a cyclic stress-strain function, and a histogram of nominal linearly elastic equivalent strain. This provides for actual cyclic stress-strain definition and crack initiation life prediction at a particular point on a cyclically loaded body. Linear finite element stress analysis plays a major role in the solution. An outline for computer-aided implementation and a case history are included. 820693. (P-109) Optimization of a light truck rough road durability procedure using fatigue analysis meth- odology. J. E. Birchmeier and K. V. Smith, Truck Operations, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. This paper describes a procedure using fatigue analysis methodology to interpret light truck rough road durability testing in terms of customer usage. The resulting corre- lation can be used in conjunction with optimization methods to provide a rough road durability procedure that insures adequate durability test objectives while decreas- ing the degree of over-test. The following procedure can be adopted to any durability test where the relationship between durability test severity and "customer" severity can be quantified. This method may create new durability testing procedures that result in less time and cost while improving durability test accuracy. 820695. (P-109) Fatigue considerations in welded struc- ture. Drew V. Nelson, Mechanical Engineering Dept., Stanford Univ., Stanford, CA. Primary factors which influence the fatigue behavior of welded structure are described. The status of methods for predicting the life to crack formation in weldments and subsequent life spent in crack propagation are reviewed, and their advantages and current limitations for use in fatigue design evaluations discussed. Manufacturing methods for improving weld fatigue strength are sum- marized. Future life prediction development needs are suggested. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820696. (P-109) Nodular iron hypoid gears. Neil M. Lottridge, Central Foundry Div., General Motors Div.; and Robert B. Grindahl, Ramos Arizpe Engine Plant, GM de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Successful conversion of nodular iron hypoid gears from steel to nodular iron required initial vehicle and labo- ratory fatigue tests to supplement a material development program. This was followed by manufacturing process refinement and finally an extensive series of vehicle durability tests. Nodular iron gears have good fatigue life, are approximately 10% lighter than steel, have greater damping capacity which reduces noise, have greater torsional strength and the graphite in nodular iron results in more score resistance. Nodular iron gears have significantly improved machinability which translates to improved productivity. They are easier to heat treat, can be "free-quenched", and require less energy to manu- facture. 820697. (P-109) Integrated design/fatigue analysis study. Brian Dabell, Product Engineering Div., GKN Technology Ltd., Wolverhampton, England. Realistic design processes must integrate service loading, shape and material in order to avoid the pitfalls likely to be encountered by considering any one area in isolation. To optimise the design and manufacture of components and equipment to meet operational demands, it is essential to know the service loads they will experience and interpret these in terms of their effect on durability. Efficient and reliable computer methods integrated into the design process now offer rapid appreciation of the effects on component durability due to dimensional and material changes. This paper highlights the important role played by these techniques at GKN by reference to a number of case histories. 820698. (P-109) Fatigue considerations for FRP com- posites. David A. Riegner and Jamie C. Hsu, GM Manufacturing Development, General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. An introduction to the fatigue properties of Fiber Reinforced Plastic (FRP) composites is given. The implications of these properties in the design of composite structures are stressed. Topics covered include: an overview of FRP composites, a definition of fatigue and fatigue testing, a comparison of typical metal and FRP fatigue mechanisms, and a discussion of the major fatigue design considerations for FRP composites. Finally, a 100</page><page sequence="82">system's view is presented to illustrate the inter-depend- ence of material, design, and processing considerations in fatigue of FRP composites. 820699. (P-109) Fatigue considerations in use of alu- minum alloys. M. R. Mitchell and M. E. Meyer, Rockwell International Science Center, Thou- sand Oaks, CA.; and N. Q. Nguyen, Lawrence Livermore Labs., Livermore, CA. The objective of this research was to predict the fatigue life of a member at 10 percentile levels for SAE-1045 (260HB) steel and 7075-T73 aluminum in aqueous and saline environments. Consideration of environmental effects as rate dependent phenomena promoted the usage of controlled strain rate testing on axial loaded, smooth specimens of each material. It was determined primarily that long-life fatigue resistance is more affected by aqueous and saline environments, and that a simple modification of the fatigue strength exponent adequately described strain-life behavior. The statistical aspects of scatter in fatigue lives for the 7075-T73 aluminum were evaluated by testing several samples at each of four different strain amplitudes. Agreement between predicted and laboratory test results appears encouraging. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820700. (P-109) Fatigue considerations in use of high- strength sheet steel. R. W. Landgraf, Engineer- ing &amp; Research Staff, Ford Motor Co., Dear- born, MI. The fatigue behavior of representative classes of high- strength low-alloy and dual phase steel is reviewed. Cyclic properties describing stress-strain and strain-life relations are used to quantitatively assess material variability as well as processing and environmental effects. Examples of the use of this materials information in design analysis and, in particular, component downgaging are then presented. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820716. A review of commuter propulsion technology. Arnold Brooks and Robert Hirschkron, General Electric Co., Lynn, MA. The modern current and derivative engines powering commuter turboprops are reviewed. Those features of particular importance to this application are stressed. These features include low fuel consumption, high reliability and low acquisition and maintenance cost. The result, a Propulsion Study for NASA, (part of Small Transport Advanced Technology - STAT) which explored the cycles and design features for further powerplant improvements, are also summarized. This study described the potential benefits of advanced powerplants in a 30 passenger and a 50 passenger commuter turboprop. 820717. Design features of a new commuter turboprop engine. M. D. Stoten, Advanced Design Anal- ysis, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft of Canada Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. 820720 This paper reviews the requirements for the short range airline turbopropeller engine for the new market condi- tions of deregulation with high fuel costs. Airframe size ranges to be covered define the engine powers and the economics of operation define design priorities. A new aircraft engine family, the PW100 series, is used to illustrate how design choices can be made to meet these requirements. Some of the technologies considered in this process are discussed. Finally, the future prospects of this sector of the airline business are reviewed, with the changes in the powerplant that will be necessary. 820718. Development potential of intermittent combustion (I.C.) aircraft engines for commuter transport applications. Edward A. Willis, Intermittent Combustion Engines Branch, NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH.; and John B. Olcott, Business Aviation Weekly. This paper presents a brief update on general aviation (g/a) and commuter aircraft propulsion research efforts and studies which have been underway at NASA's Lewis Research Center (LeRC) for several years. The review covers studies and limited corroborative research on several advanced I.C. engine concepts, emphasizing lightweight diesels and rotary stratified-charge engines. Using available information, the current state-of- the-art is first evaluated for lightweight, aircraft-suitable versions of each engine. This information together with available study and experimental results is used to project the engine characteristics that can be expected on "near-term" and "long-term" time horizons. The key enabling technology requirements are identified for each engine on the "long-term" time horizon. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820719. Modern propellers for commuter airlines. J. G. Russell, Dowty Rotol Limited, Gloucester, Eng- land. Modern airline propellers show significant improvements in weight, noise, cost and complexity over those designed in the 1950's and 60's and still in service. These improvements have come as the result of development work started a considerable number of years ago, covering aerodynamics, hub structure, blade retention, pitch control system and composite blades. These developments and associated design philosophies regarding safety and minimising maintenance costs are discussed, together with the achievement of the test background essential before new ideas can be introduced into service. In the near future wider blades and/or an increased number of blades are likely to be required as cruise speeds are pushed upwards and noise becomes an even more important design parameter. 820720. Advanced propeller technology for new commuter aircraft. Rolland G. Daigneault and Donald G. Hall, Hamilton Standard. Numerous propeller technology advancements are being 101</page><page sequence="83">820720 incorporated into propellers being developed for com- muter aircraft to emerge in the mid-80's. These tech- nological advancements will result in propeller system characteristics superior to those of current production commuter propeller systems. They are described in detail herein as is their effect on aircraft performance and operation. Looking beyond the mid-80's production commuter propellers, potential propeller technological advancements are identified that could further improve propeller system characteristics. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820721. Future propulsion* opportunities for commuter airplanes. William C. Strack, Subsonic Missions Section, National Aeronautics and Space Ad- ministration, Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. A summary is presented of a series of recent studies that address commuter airplane propulsion opportunities in the 1990-2000 timeframe. Consideration is given to advanced technology conventional turboprop engines, advanced propellers, and several unconventional alter- natives: regenerative turboprops, ro taries, and diesels. Advanced versions of conventional turboprops (including propellers) offer 15-20 percent savings in fuel and 10-15 percent in DOC compared to the new crop of 1500-2000 SHP engines currently in development. Unconventional engines could boost the fuel savings to 30-40 percent. The conclusion is that several important opportunities exist and therefore powerplant technology need not plateau. 820722. Design considerations for ease of maintenance in commuter aircraft. M. G. Freeman, Air Midwest, Inc. (Wichita, Kansas). The commuter aircraft is subject to an unique operating environment compared to other air carrier aircraft. The small size of the aircraft, in conjunction with the small corporate size of the typical commuter air carrier, forces the aircraft into a critical role regarding the operator's success. As a result, the effect of the aircraft design engineer's ability to achieve a reliable, easily maintained aircraft is magnified in the commuter's world. Accessability, well documented maintenance and inspection techniques and the ability to correct mal- functions in the field are the keys to a commuter aircraft's maintenance success. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820728. The Dash 8-design considerations. G. R. Jackson, The de Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd. The Dash 8 is a new 36-passenger airliner designed to fulfill a broad range of Regional Transport applications beginning in 1984. This paper describes some of the factors which have directed the basic configuration and the design objectives chosen for the Dash 8 development program. 820729. Advanced technology for the SAAB-Fairchild 340 Aircraft. Robert J. Sanator and George Honc- zarenko, Fairchild Republic Co., Farmingdale, N.Y. This paper describes the advanced technologies intro- duced in the design and manufacture of the SAAB- Fairchild 340 Airliner. Among these are its aerodynamics, propulsion system, structural concept, materials, avionics and passenger seat. Advanced technology in the 340 design will result in a quality airliner better able to provide economical, reliable service with greater passenger com- fort. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820730. The CAC-100 - design features. Ladislao Paz- many, Commuter Aircraft Corp., San Diego, CA. The design of a fifty-passenger commuter transport aircraft for use in a competitive short haul passenger market is discussed from a design point of view. The CAC-100 is the solution for a quiet, fast, efficient airplane which offers to the passenger the same features as the commercial jets. 820731. Advanced technology for future regional transport aircraft. Louis J. Williams, General Aviation and Commuter Technology Office, NASA-Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA. In 1978, NASA established a Small Transport Aircraft Technology (STAT) team to study whether there are technical improvements in commuter aircraft that would likely increase their public acceptance and use, and to examine the possibility that NASA's aeronautical research and technology program could help U.S. commuter aircraft manufacturers develop superior future commuter aircraft. The STAT team undertook a series of studies, analyses, and discussions with aircraft manufacturers, airline operators, and other government agencies. This paper presents the results of the STAT aircraft manu- facturer studies. It also summarizes those portions of NASA's overall aeronautics research and technology programs which have applicability to commuter aircraft design, and suggests areas of technology which could be expanded to aid manufacturers in the evolution of improved aircraft for this market. It is becoming more apparent that the expanding market and competitive pressures will accelerate the use of technological advances in future commuter aircraft as they become available. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820732. Design of unconventional commuter configura- tions. R. Srivatsan and Jan Roskam, Univ. of Kansas Flight Research Laboratory. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the design of advanced commuter configurations. The air- planes were required to carry 30 passengers over a 600 n.m. stage length at a cruise Mach number of 0.6 at an altitude of 28000 feet. The airplanes were required to have inherent static stability. Five unconventional twin turboprop configurations were investigated. These consisted of three canard and two 3-surface configurations. To provide separation of 102</page><page sequence="84">passengers and crew from the plane of the propellers and engine turbine and compressor discs, aft-mounted push- er-propeller configurations were adopted. This also re- sulted in a saving in the amount of sound proofing (weight). High wing loading was chosen to reduce wetted area and achieve good ride qualities. The combination of high wing loading and the required inherent static stability made it extremely difficult to realize canard configurations. In the config- urations with wing-mounted engines, the aft positioning of the wing and hence the fuel tanks gave rise to rather large center-of-gravity travel and hence trim problems under certain flight conditions. The 3-surface configuration with pylon-mounted engines looked promising. Although a single canard configuration did not emerge, the config- uration with pylon-mounted engines, again, appeared the most flexible. 820740. Toyota computer controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Yutaka Taga, Kazumasa Naka- mura, and Hiroshi Ito, Chassis and Drive Train Engineering Dept., Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.; and Takao Taniguchi, Product Engineering and Development Dept., Aisin-Warner, Ltd. As the computer control concept develops, its application has potential answers to better fuel economy requirements in the automotive industry. Under overall programs to upgrade the total vehicle performance, Toyota has been developing automatic transmissions systematically. A new automatic transmission employing a microcomputer was introduced for better economy and driveability. The microcomputer controls shift and lock-up clutch operating schedules. The transmission ensures mechanical coupling from the low gear for high efficiency while maintaining superior shift quality with the lock-up clutch control during shift transition. It also offers shift pattern selection for various driving conditions and driver's preference. 820741. Efficiency characteristics of manual and automatic passenger car transaxles. Leo A. M. van Dongen, Eindhoven Univ. of Technology, The Nether- lands. Up to the present gearbox efficiencies are assumed to be constant, although the losses in these components are dependent on both speed and load. The primary target of this paper is to provide efficiency characteristics of commercially available passenger car transaxles: a 4- speed manual and a 3-speed automatic transaxle. A test-bench has been constructed in order to simulate the drive performance tests of these transaxles. The infor- mation obtained in this way reveals the performance of the transmissions in various torque-speed ranges (at full load power ratings as well as partial load conditions). Also the no load loss tests are carried out. The performance data are presented in the form of graphs, in which the plotted parameters are efficiency, torque and speed. From these results conclusions are drawn on the efficiency of both drive trains. SÁE Trans., Vol . 91 820746 820742. The B&amp;M SuperDrive - an aftermarket torque converter to improve fuel economy of" large engined cars. George M. Wallace, B&amp;M Au- tomotive Products, Chatsworth, CA. A torque converter has been developed for aftermarket use in older, heavier, large engined cars and light trucks to improve fuel economy, particularly at highway speeds. This torque converter includes an output coupled over- drive and torque split within the converter itself. This torque converter has shown gains in highway fuel economy of 9 to 21 percent. The converter changes that give the improved fuel economy result in a lower acceleration level for the vehicle. 820743. Analysis of part-time four-wheel drive vehicle. Hideyuki Usui, Shigeru Nishikura, and Kazuo Takematsu, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. This paper reviews the operation of the part-time four-wheel drive vehicle on a high friction paved road. A summary of our investigations follows: 1) The difference in tire radius between the front and rear wheels has a significant influence on traction. 2) When braking, the torque which occurs in the drive line is much larger with four-wheel drive. 3) The driving resistance of four-wheel drive is different from that of two-wheel drive; it is smaller when driving force is in operation. 820745. Microprocessor controlled continuously variable rubber V-belt transmission for an automobile. K. Srinivasan, D. R. Houser, and G. L. Kinzel, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Ohio State Univ.; and D. L. Mattern, Union Carbide Corp. The technical advancements in microprocessors and their incorporation in motor vehicles has led to the feasibility of using continuously variable transmissions in automobiles. This paper discusses the design, development and testing of a rubber V-belt continuously variable transmission for a production vehicle. Overall speed ratios in excess of 7.0 were achieved with a hydraulically actuated driver sheave and a spring and cam loaded driven sheave. The drive was controlled with an 8-bit microprocessor which operated in three different control modes. The test results show that the rubber V-belt is viable for automotive use and has potential for improved fuel economy while maintaining good vehicle drivability. 820746. A rubber belt CVT for front-wheel-drive cars. Richard F. Stieg and Wm. Spencer Worley, The Gates Corp., Denver, CO. A wide ratio, rubber V-belt driven, continuously variable transmission was designed, built, and operated in a 1.7 liter engine, front- wheel-drive car. A new V-belt under development with transverse stiffening elements is used in the demonstration CVT. Engine operation is controlled to a specified operating line by the CVT mechanical control system. The analytically determined belt side forces are varied with the torque load to maximize belt life. 103</page><page sequence="85">820746 Dynamometer tests showed a 17.7% improvement in mechanical efficiency over a 3 speed automatic trans- mission. Vehicle fuel economy tests showed a 15.5% improvement for the EPA driving cycle. Driveability is improved by the smoothness of operation and the absence of discrete ratio changes. The design method described is adaptable to different types of sheave control systems. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820747. Optimal control for maximum mileage of a flywheel energy-storage vehicle. Fereidoon S. Jamzadeh and Andrew A. Frank, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Univ. of Wisconsin - Madison, Madison, WI. The flywheel energy-storage unit is examined as a tool for engine load management. The control decision to store oř retrieve energy is formulated and discussed. Vehicle dynamics are simulated on a digital computer in com- bination with dynamic programming techniques to obtain optimal operation policy. The simplified algorithm is explained, as well as the cost-function criteria and optimization constraints. The sensitivity of the optimal path and the vehicle gas-mileage improvements are elaborated. The study of losses indicates that the trans- mission is the largest energy sink in the power train. The result of this study provides an indication of the appropriate real-time control policy. 820749. Valve events and engine operation. T. W. Asmus, Chrysler Corp. In SI automotive engines valve events exert a major influence on charge composition under highly throttled conditions such as idle and also on WOT performance. In the interest of promoting maximum idle quality with minimum idle fuel consumption, minimization of valve overlap is desireable. Maximizing engine performance via valve events within the aforementioned constraint is the substance of this paper. Valve events are discussed on the basis of instantaneous changes in cylinder volume in a phased relationship with flow area created by valve lift. Indicator (P-V) diagrams focused on pumping loops at WOT over a broad speed range provide a rational basis for selecting exhaust valve timing points. Key to achieving the stated objective of minimizing valve overlap is delaying the timing of intake-valve opening while estab- lishing the timing of intake-valve closing on the basis of the desired balance between low-speed torque and power. SAE Trans- Vol. 91 820750. Effect of inlet parameters on the flow charac- teristics in a four-stroke model engine. C. Arcoumanis, A. F. Bicen, and J. H. Whitelaw, Imperial College of Science and Technology, Department of Mechanical Engineering, Fluids Section, London, England. The flow structure in a four-stroke model engine motored at 200 rpm with a compression ratio of 3.5 has been investigated. Ensemble-averaged axial and swirl mean and rms velocities have been obtained by laser-Doppler anemometry downstream of an axisymmetrically located single valve with 30 and 60 degree seat angles and various lifts, with and without induction swirl. In all cases, the intake-generated flow structure in the axial plane dis- appears by the time the inlet valve closes and results in nearly homogeneous turbulence during compression with levels of 0.5-0.7 times the mean piston speed. The swirling flow, however, which is induced by means of vanes, persists through the compression stroke, evolving from a spiralling motion early during intake into solid body type of rotation near TDC of compression, with associated swirl ratios increasing with valve lift. 820751. Air motion in a two-stroke engine cylinder - the effects of exhaust geometry. Nak Won Sung and Donald J. Patterson, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics, The Uni- versity of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Air motion in one cylinder of a Detroit Diesel 6V-92 two stroke diesel engine was studied under steady flow bench test conditions by a laser Doppler anemometer and an axisymmetric finite difference fluid dynamic model. The effects of four different exhaust opening geometries were explored. Measurements and calculations showed that the swirl induced by the 18 angled inlet ports produced non- uniform axial velocity profiles and large peaks in the mid-radius region (between cylinder center and wall). The exhaust opening geometry in the head of the cylinder influenced these axial velocity fields especially in the upper region of the cylinder. The study concluded that more uniform flow, which is favorable to the scavenging process, can be achieved by an exhaust opening located close to the cylinder periphery. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820752. Damping composite sheet for noise control. Kenji Sakai, Haruo Fujiwara, and Masuhiro Sato, Kobe Steel Ltd., Kakogawa, Hyogo, Japan. With regard to the reduction of engine noise caused by cars, which is one of important technology in the automobile industry, vibration damping composite steel sheet has been developed. This sheet is made of a layer of visco-elastic synthetic resin sandwiched by 2 sheets of steel. The excellent vibration damping of the sheet is shown by its "loss factor" (rj) ãO.5 at 80°C and approximately 3 dB (A) noise reduction when applied to the engine cover of a portable generator, indicates that this steel sheet has application to automobile parts in which noise reduction should be considered. This paper describes the manufacturing process and some basic properties of this sheet followed by its applications. 820753. Piston "stick slip" noise generation mechanism. John M. Beardmore, General Motors Corp., G.M. Proving Ground, Milford, MI. An experimental approach was undertaken to investigate a low speed "diesel sounding" knock of an L-4, 1.6 litre, gasoline engine. Specific tests were devised to show the 104</page><page sequence="86">noise source to be associated with piston and ring friction. It was concluded that the noise was caused by a "stick-slip" action of the piston assembly as the piston reversed direction at the top and bottom of its' stroke. The instantaneous change between static and dynamic coef- ficients of friction resulted in an abrupt force reaction, which excited the crankshaft's natural frequencies. Design parameters were optimized to provide a 10 dB(A) (A-weighted sound level) reduction of noise at idle. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820754. Noise reduction by engine encapsulation. Her- mann Danckert and Werner Ebbinghaus, Volks- wagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft, Forschung Aggregatetechnik, Wolfsburg, West Germany. An engine-jacketing type capsule for a VW engine (VH = 0.9 to 1.3 1) was built and tested. The entire drive unit - consisting of the engine, clutch, transmission and output shafts - was enclosed in a relative close-fitting sheet steel capsule. The radiator, carburetor, air-filter and muffler system are outside the capsule. A reduction in total vehicle drive-by noise of 7 dB(A) was achieved under ISO-test conditions. The efficacy and practicability of the concept have been established. No safety or handling problems have been encounted, but service and repair are naturally somewhat hindered. The work was sponsored by the Federal Environ- mental Authority of Germany. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820755. Developing a small sample facility for testing automotive acoustical materials at low frequen- cies. Pranab Saha, Blachford Engineers, Troy, MI; Current affiliation: C. F. Braun &amp; Co., Chemical Engineering Dept., Alhambra, CA.; and Charles W. Davis, Ford Motor Co., Scien- tific Research Lab., Dearborn, MI; Current affiliation: Product Test &amp; Development Group, Smyrna, TN. This paper discusses the development of a small sample test facility for properly evaluating the low frequency noise control performances of various automotive acous- tical materials. Based on several tests conducted with 0.61 m (24 in) diameter samples, this facility is designed to operate in the frequency range of 35 Hz to 355 Hz. Near-field root-mean-square acoustic pressure and acous- tic velocity were measured for this purpose, using a dual microphone probe. This methodology allows one to test acoustical materials without elaborate test facilities and without the need for any special acoustic test environ- ment. 820758. Consideration of ignition lag and combustion time in a spark ignition engine using a data acquisition system. G. A. Karim, Y. Al-Alousi, and W. Anson, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. 820760 An approach is described, employing a data acquisition system that provides information regarding the statistical cycle variation in a range of performance parameters of a spark ignition engine fuelled with methane. The approach can provide a simultaneous record of the rate of work production as well as the time taken for a flame kernel to be developed following spark ignition and the subsequent time needed to complete the combustion process. Such information can be provided either continuously or randomly over a large number of cycles. Thus, cyclic variation in performance parameters is linked to impor- tant combustion parameters without recourse to high speed photography nor to the use of transparent heads or pistons. Some typical results involving a single cylinder variable compression ratio CFR engine are then pre- sented. 820759. Thermal combustion modeling - theoretical and experimental investigation of the knocking pro- cess. R. Maly and G. Ziegler, Institut fuer Physikalische Elektronik, University of Stutt- gart, Stuttgart. Starting from the energy balance within a quasistationary flame front the principal dependence of the flame front velocity on the physical properties of the mixture are modeled. In closed systems (e.g. S.I. engines, bombs, etc.) however, flame propagation may lead to feedback proc- esses accelerating the front velocity until infinity. The model calculation predicts two feedback processes: flame acceleration by turbulence enhancement and flame acceleration by enhancement of the temperature of the end gas. Comparing available engine data from the literature on knock effects with the model predictions indicates full agreement in all observed and predicted dependencies. It is concluded therefore that the proposed model is very promising in providing a quantitative description of knock. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820760. 'FM' - a high efficiency combustion system for the future light duty engine?S. R. Norris-Jones and J. T. Russell, Ricardo Consulting Engineers pic, Bridge Works, Shoreham-By-Sea, Sussex. Consideration of the approaching "energy crisis' reveals two requirements for future light duty automotive engines. 1) maximum economy and 2) the ability (perhaps with detail design re-optimi- sation) to accept a range of fuels of petroleum or other extract, of differing ignition characteristics. One combustion system which meets these require- ments is the MAN 'FM', the potential of which has already been demonstrated in truck-size engines but on which little information has been published in light-duty engine bore sizes. The paper describes both design and experimental work carried out to evaluate the application of the FM combustion system to a light duty passenger car engine. Consideration is given to the critical design param- 105</page><page sequence="87">820760 eters associated with the application of the FM system to a multi-cylinder gasoline based engine and how the criteria can be met. Details of the design and construction of a single cylinder derivative of the multi-cylinder engine are given. Results from the single cylinder engine for a wide range of tests on 91 RON gasoline engine are presented and discussed, with reference to optimum chamber geometry, swirl, injection and ignition requirements, power output, fuel consumption and emissions. Infor- mation is also given on the ability of the system to accept pressure charging. SAE Trans., Vol 91 820761. Evaluation of seating comfort. Ken Kamijo, Harutoshi Tsujimura, Hideo Obara, and Masaaki Katsumata, Central Engineering Lab- oratories, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd., Yokosuka, Japan. In our study we have attempted to determine a method for objectively evaluating seating comfort. Forty-three different front passenger car seats were subjectively evaluated for comfort under static conditions. The following objective data for these seats were meas- ured for possible correlation with the subjective evalu- ation: static pressure distribution characteristics, static load/deflection characteristics and vibration character- istics. The pattern of the static pressure distribution was found to approximately correlate with the difference between comfortable and uncomfortable seats. It was also found that the sensation of being cushioned, one of the subjective evaluation factors, was related to the natural frequency obtained from the vibration experiments as well as to the static spring constant obtained from the static load/deflection experiments. Further, by using the paired comparison method, six seats mounted on a servohydraulic shaker were subjec- tively evaluated for dynamic seating comfort and these results were compared with the results of the objective measurements. This comparison showed that subjective dynamic seating comfort is related to both the natural frequency and the transmission ratio. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820762. Theoretical model of a vehicle using vector analysis and Euler's rigid body dynamics. S. Wahid Zewari, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ.; and Bayard E. Quinn, Purdue Univ. A comprehensive survey of literature in the field of vehicle dynamics reveals an enormous amount of individual efforts in promoting the understanding of this field. One of the most talked about classical models is the so-called "bicycle model". Other similar models exist, but while producing preliminary and ready estimates they exclude important features such as roll and pitch degrees of freedom and dynamic load transfers. The next generation of models seems to be so complex that a mere review of them requires exhaustive endeavors. One has to devote considerable time and effort to work with such models, not to mention the need for and access to big corporate computing facilities. The main purpose of this paper is to establish a mathematical model of minimum complexity without loss of generality. It will enable one to study the dynamic behavior of cars in executing maneuvers and undergoing severe braking. The derivation of the mathematical model based on vector analysis and Euler's equations of motion is so straight forward that any beginning student of vehicle dynamics could easily read through and build upon it any degree of complexity he/she may desire. 820763. Design of the hollow stabilizer. Kanji Inoue, Hiroshi Koyama, and Akira Ohno, Research and Development Dept., NHK Spring Co., Ltd., Isogo, Yokohama, Japan. For the purpose of weight-saving of automobile, stabilizer (anti-roll bar) is now being designed by tube. This paper is mainly concerned with the basic consideration of de- signing hollow stabilizer. The mechanics of the stress distribution which occurs to hollow stabilizer, was obtained experimentally. It was found that the stress condition of hollow stabilizer was entirely different from that of solid stabilizer. The application of pipe factor makes it possible to predict the design stress of hollow stabilizer. The experimental results have good agreement with the calculated results obtained by Finite Element Method. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820764. Transient dynamic behaviour of a vehicle by mathematical simulation. P. Beuzit, P. Fontanet, and J. Simon, Regie Nationale des Usines Renault (France). In order to improve the vehicle's stability in riding, a complete linear mathematical model has been developed for a front wheel drive vehicle. All the suspension and steering effects are taken into account. Two approaches are used: the modal analysis of the vehicle response can be well represented by two modes (exponential and sinusoidal) only and coupling between 3 basical motions: yaw - side-slipping, rolling and steering. The effects of the main characteristics of the vehicle on the responses are studied essentially in the way of damping. This study exhibits the importance of coupling between yawing and rolling. The optimization consists to decrease the importance of the coupling and the rolling as far as possible. In order to do that, a semi-analytical study of the transfer function between yaw velocity and roll angle is performed. This allows to check the best set of suspen- sion's parameters. 106</page><page sequence="88">820766. The measurement and improvement of the transient A/F characteristics of an electronic fuel injection system. D. R. Hamburg and David Klick, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. An engine-dynamometer test procedure for evaluating the transient A/F characteristics of fuel metering systems is described. Actual transient A/F data obtained with a prototype multi-point electronic fuel injection (EFI) system are presented, and an electronic compensation scheme for reducing the A/F transient excursions is discussed.

An intelligent fuel-metering system which computes vehicle fuel economy based on measurements of fuel consumed, distance traveled and elapsed time was developed for laboratory use. It can be used with either carbureted or fuel-injected engines using gasoline, alcohol, gasohol or diesel fuel either as a stand alone or as a host computer-controlled system. The system is capable of checking itself by purging its fuel-delivering hardware and verifying the calibration of the fuel transducer. Its modes of operation, fuel flow system, microcomputer-coordi- nated measurements, computation, and video display of measurement results are discussed. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820768. Measurement of engine valve train compliance under dynamic conditions. Ronald J. Herrin, Engine Research Dept., General Motors Re- search Labs., Warren, MI. A simple measurement system has been developed to quantify compliance (lost motion) in an engine valve train and to pinpoint accurately valve opening and closing under dynamic operation. The instrumentation is unob- trusive and can be applied to engines equipped with pushrod-actuated overhead valves without disrupting normal engine operation. The measurement system was used to quantify total valve-train compliance at the times of valve opening and closing for broad ranges of engine speed and oil temperature. In addition, three different components of lifter compliance - deformation, leakage, and telescoping - were individually quantified. This in- formation allows valve timing to be predicted accurately for use in both engine thermodynamic cycle analysis and cam design. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820769. Experimental method of determining piston profile by use of composite materials. Toshiro Yagi and Ichiro Yamagata, Technology Devel- opment Div., Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd., Japan. Piston profile has a substantial effect on engine per- formance. A new method of determining piston profile, using composite materials, has been developed. In this method, preliminary piston surfaces are coated 820771 with the composite materials which have excellent char- acteristics with respect to thermal resistance, adhessive- ness and lubrication. After being subjected to piston marking test, the composite material remaining on the piston defines a new piston profile. This new method gives a piston profile which has much reliability against scuffing, oil consumption and greater reduction in engine noise, friction and emission. And also this method makes it possible to evaluate quantitatively the piston profile correction after marking test and to shorten the profile developing time, compared with conventional testing methods.

Gabele, Roy Zweidinger, and Frank Black, Mobile Source Emissions Research Branch, Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC. A series of emissions tests were completed with 2 light duty diesel passenger cars, a Volkswagen and Oldsmobile, to examine the sensitivity of emission rates and compo- sition to fuel. Four fuels including 3 petroleum distillates and an oil shale distillate were used in the program. The tests included 6 driving schedules. Determinations of gaseous emission rates, including total hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and oxides of nitrogen, and particulate emission rates were completed. Compositional charac- terization of the particulate matter included dichloro- methane soluble organic fraction, benzo(a)pyrene, pyrene, nitropyrene, Ames TA-98 bioassay, and trace elements. Both gaseous and particulate mass emission rates were insensitive to the fuels examined in this program. The polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon compounds associated with the particles varied between fuels, but were not well correlated with the fuel polynuclear aromatic hydrocar- bon content. Ames TA-98 mutagenic activity was elevated with the oil shale distillate fuel in the Volkswagen but reasonably consistent for all other vehicle-fuel combi- nations examined. 820771. Effects of alternate source diesel fuels on light-duty diesel emissions. Bruce B. Bykowski, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX.; and Thomas M. Baines, Environmental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, MI. Several alternate source diesel test fuels were studied to note their effects on regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions from a 1980 Volkswagen Rabbit. Nine fuel blends were tested, including a No. 2 petroleum diesel as base, base plus coal-derived liquids (via SRC-II and EDS processes), shale oil diesel and jet fuel, and other blends of coal-derived liquids, shale oil liquids, and petroleum stocks. Analyses performed include gaseous hydrocar- bons, CO, NOx, particulate mass, phenols, smoke, odor, Ames tests, BaP, and polarity profiles by HPLC. Smoke and particulate increases were generally associated with use of coal-derived liquids. 107</page><page sequence="89">820771 SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820772. Analysis of particulate and gaseous emissions data from in-use diesel passenger cars. James D. Hyde, Richard E. Gibbs, Robert A. Whitby, Stanley M. Byer, Benjamin J. Hill, Thomas E. Hoffman, Robert E. Johnson, and Paul L. Werner, New York State Dept. of Environmen- tal Conservation, Div. of Air, Albany, NY. A sample of 20 in-use light-duty diesel vehicles were extensively and repeatedly tested for two years. Gaseous and particulate emissions were measured for the FTP, HFET, CFDS, NYCC, 50 mph cruise, and idle driving cycles. Vehicles were tested with both as-received and control fuel and lubricating oil. Particulate extracts were obtained by Soxhlet extraction with dichloromethane, and the extracts assayed for mutagenic activity by the Ames Salmonella typhimurium/microsome method with TA98(-) tester strain. Particulate, extract, residue, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, % extractible, fuel economy and Ames activity are discussed as they relate to driving cycles and mileage accumulation. Driving cycles were found to affect emissions more strongly and consistently than does mileage accumulation. Cycle and mileage effects were observed in some cases for Ames activity but were not well defined. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820774. Analysis of PAH in diesel exhaust particulate by high resolution capillary column gas chromatog- raphy/mass spectrometry. Bruce A. Petersen, Cheng C. Chuang, Timothy L. Hayes, and David A. Tray ser, Battelle's Columbus Labo- ratories. A method has been developed to analyze PAH in diesel exhaust particulate filter samples. The method consists of collection of particulate filter samples, extraction and PAH fractionation of the filter samples, and analysis of the PAH by capillary cohimn gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Perdeutero PAH were used as internal standard compounds to measure the recovery of PAH during preparation of the particulate filter samples for analysis. Verification of recovery of PAH during extrac- tion was conducted by spiking the extraction solvent and particulate filter samples with these compounds. Two perduetero PAH levels, about half and twice the engine PAH concentration, were used. Recoveries averaged about 80 percent for the low level and about 90 percent for the high level. The method was demonstrated to give accurate engine PAH measurements in particulate filter sample extracts when corrections were made for the perdeutero PAH losses. 820775. Analysis of nitroaromatics in diesel and gasoline car emissions. Silvestre B. Tejada, Roy B. Zweidinger, and John E. Sigsby, Jr., Environ- mental Protection Agency, Environmental Sci- ences Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, NC. A routine on-line reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/HPLC fluorescence method has been developed which greatly simplifies the analysis of selected nitroaromatic compounds in complex matrices. Sensitivity of the method is generally in the low picogram to low nanogram levels. The method is based on on-column catalytic reduction of the non-fluorescent nitroaromatic compounds to the corresponding highly fluorescent amine derivatives. Compound selectivity is achieved by chromatographic separation, use of selective wavelengths for fluorescence detection and column switching techniques. The analytical system conveniently eliminates tedious sample clean-up. In most cases only about 25 micrograms of the crude sample is needed per analysis. For 1-nitropyrene, a precision of ±3% at the one nanogram level is routinely obtained. Observed 1-nitro- pyrene levels typically varied from 15 to 120 ppm in the soluble organic fraction of diesel engine particulate emissions and from 4 to 90 ppm in the case of gasoline engine emissions.

Fred Stump, Ronald Bradow, William Ray, David Dropkin, Roy Zweidinger, and John Sigsby, U.S. E.P.A., RTP, NC.; and Richard Snow, Northrop Services, Inc. A procedure using a porous polymer resin as a trapping medium, was developed and verified as a viable means for collecting gas phase hydrocarbons in the diesel fuel (C10 + ) range. The method was then used in a series of diesel and gasoline powered passenger car studies aimed at comparing the gas phase with the particle-bound hydro- carbon mutagenic activity. A second objective was to compare the dilute exhaust polymer trapping method with the cold water raw exhaust trapping system. The VW Rabbit diesel studies showed the gas phase activity to be less than 1 1% that of the particle-bound with the activity relationship depending upon the test cycle. The gasoline studies showed the gaseous hydrocarbon activity to be at or near background level. A comparison of the particle-bound activity from the diesel and gasoline engines showed the gasoline emissions activity, reverents per mile, to be less than 12% that of the diesel emissions. A comparison of the trapping systems, polymer-dilute vs cold water-raw exhaust, showed good comparability with the Rabbit diesel study. 820777. Simulation of the Ford Vehicle Speed Control System. S. J. Sobolak, Ford Motor Co., Elec- trical and Electronics Div. This paper describes a mathematical model of the Ford Vehicle Speed Control System (Cruise Control). The model consists of component models of the engine, fluid coupling, speed sensor, actuator (pneumatic or electric), and vehicle dynamics. A computer implementation of the model is used to calculate the dynamic response of system variables to a sequence of driver commands, and to a sinusoidal road profile. Example computer solutions are 108</page><page sequence="90">given. The model is useful in evaluating system per- formance of proposed design innovations, determining performance sensitivity to component parameter values, and serves as a learning tool.

An experimentally obtained low order sampled data description of the response of engine speed to throttle opening and spark advance is used to describe the idle speed dynamics of a 5.8L engine with an automatic transmission. Based upon the sampled data model, a multi-input idle speed controller is designed that returns the idle speed to its set point within five engine revolutions after the application of a load. The "cost" of control is examined and experimental data is shown for application of a sudden power steering load utilizing control of spark advance and a slow throttle actuator. 820779. An electric vehicle dynamic simulation. Donald J. Dobner, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI.; and Edward J. Woods, General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI; Current Affiliation: Reliance Electric Co., Cleveland, OH. A complete electric vehicle dynamic simulation has been developed for evaluating the performance of drive train components and control strategies. The simulation in- cludes models for the drive motor and its field controller and armature chopper, the battery, a transmission, and a transmission actuator and associated transmission control to accomplish automatic gear changes. These component models along with a vehicle dynamics model provide simulated vehicle performance in response to driver commands. The simulation provides a tool for developing control algorithms, and serves as a basis for examining other electric vehicle problems. The modular structure readily allows adding or substituting component models so that other hardware configurations can be studied. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820780. Fatigue life estimation by portable data acqui- sition and damage analysis microcomputer sys- tem. R. A. Schaefer, Ford Motor Company. A portable microcomputer system with the capability of acquiring strain data and estimating fatigue life to crack initiation has been developed. This briefcase sized equipment performs rainflow cycle counting of the input strain signal and a cumulative damage analysis which fully accounts for both plastic and elastic region effects and includes the effects of a strain concentration factor using Neuber's rule. The system responds interactively to English language commands, with all input and output in engineering units and scientific number notation. Appro- priate values for material fatigue properties are entered by the user. These properties and other parameters, such as strain concentration factor and mean strain correction, 820783 may be altered after data is acquired and a revised analysis is immediately available. The system also pro- vides a range of fatigue life estimates to suggest the sensitivity of the analysis to uncertainties in material properties. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820781. Prediction of fatigue life of spiral teeth through analysis of finite elements and experimental checks. D. Barbiero, A. Garro, and F. Rossi, Fiat Auto S.p.A., Direzione Tecnica, Sviluppo Pro- getti. During initial gearbox design, the present trend is to use gears with little diametral pitch and less valuable steel; first for noise problems and then for economical and political reasons connected with the strategical availability of some alloy materials. These reasons brought the teeth limit of fatigue to minimum required values for gearbox endurance and new methods of calculation were developed more and more sophisticated than old ones. The paper describes the theoretical approach to the stress calculation and discusses the possibility of com- paring the calculated data with the fatigue tests and the related actual performances of the gears in the case of different heat treating or surface finishing conditions. 820782. Determination of stress by means of copper electroplating. Kazuhiko Aoki and Yoshiaki Hirobe, Akebono Brake Industry Co., Ltd. In order to find out the stress imposed on machine part, strain gages are very accurate, but it is difficult to find out the distribution. Photoelasticity, stress coat etc. is adapted for this purpose, but the accuracy is insufficient. We have developed a new method to find out the stress and its distribution accurately, especially for repeated stress. When cyclic load is applied to the specimen plated with copper, grain-growth is started in the copper deposit resulting in the flecks on the surface. Number and size of grain are proportional to the magnitude of the stress applied. As the relation of stress and grain size are determined by the standard sample, the stress magnitude of any specimen can be measured by comparing the grain size after undergoing cyclic stress. Therefore this is a good method to determine the fatigue life. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820783. Characterization of exhaust emissions from high mileage catalyst-equipped automobiles. Lawrence R. Smith, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX.; and Penny M. Carey, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, MI. This paper describes the characterization of regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions, particularly aldehydes, from ten 1978 and 1979 high mileage catalyst-equipped gasoline fueled automobiles which have been driven for 109</page><page sequence="91">820783 approximately 50,000 miles. The ten automobiles were evaluated as-received and after a tune-up to manufac- turer's specifications, over the Light-Duty Federal Test Procedure (FTP) and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule (HFET). Exhaust constituents measured, in addition to the regulated emissions, include: aldehydes, particulates, sulfides, amines, and several additional compounds. 820784. Organic emissions from automobile interiors. Ruth A. Zweidinger, Joan T. Bursey, Nora C. Castillo, Ronald Keefe, and Doris Smith, Ana- lytical Sciences Div., Research Triangle Insti- tute, Research Triangle Park, NC. Six subcompact automobiles were evaluated in this study for the emission of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and other organics into the passenger compartment. The quantitation of VCM was performed using gas chro- matography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in the single ion mode. The interiors of the automobiles were ther- mostatically controlled at either 45° or 65 °C for 3 hrs before sampling the car interior. Each automobile was sampled for VCM at both temperatures. Samples for qualitative analyses were obtained at 65 °C. The GC/MS analysis resulted in the identification of 147 organic compounds in the automobile which were not found in the ambient air in the vicinity of the test. 820785. Nitrosamines in vehicle interiors. Lawrence R. Smith, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX.; and Thomas M. Baines, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, ML Researchers in the nitrosamine field were contacted on their views of the TEA analyzer and the ThermoSorb/N Air Sampler for nitrosamine analysis. Fifty-eight vehicle interiors were sampled to determine the effects of vehicle type, vehicle age, mode of operation, and ambient conditions on interior nitrosamines. Nitrosamines were found in passenger cars, station-wagons, passenger and cargo vans, pickup trucks, and in new and used heavy- duty trucks, but not in motor homes. The average daily intake of nitrosamines from vehicle interiors for a commuter in a vehicle 3 hours/day was estimated to be less than that from a can of beer or from a strip of bacon. 820786. Automotive emissions of ethylene dibromide. John E. Sigsby, Jr., David L. Dropkin, and Ronald L. Bradow, U.S. Environmental Pro- tection Agency, R.T.P., NC.; and John M. Lang, Northrop Services Inc. Ethylene dibromide, a suspected carcinogen, and ethylene dichloride are commonly used in leaded gasoline as scavengers. Ethylene dibromide emission rates were determined from seven automobiles which had a wide range of control devices, ranging from totally uncon- trolled to evaporative and catalytic emission controls. The vehicles were operated over a variety of cycles to simulate the normally encountered range of driving conditions. Evaporative losses were also measured. Tailpipe emission rates varied from 0 to 1300 micrograms ethylene dibro- mide per mile depending upon the control devices present and the operating cycle. Evaporative emission of ethylene dibromide ranged from 0.03 to 0.4 micrograms per mile equivalent. Emission of other lead-related compounds were sought but not found. The consequences of using leaded fuels in vehicles equipped with catalysts was investigated. Emission rates of ethylene dibromide increased with usage and appeared to depend on catalyst activity. Overall emission rates öf ethylene dibromide corre- lated with hydrocarbon emission rates. 820787. Ambient pollutant concentrations from mobile sources in microscale situations. Melvin N. Ingalls, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX.; and Robert J. Garbe, Environ- mental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, MI. This study was performed to provide a method of estimating concentrations of vehicle generated pollutants in areas where people and vehicles are in close proximity. A list of common exposure situations was extracted from hypothetical daily activity routines. For each situation, an appropriate dispersion model was selected. The range of real world physical variables for each situation was examined. From this range, typical and severe actual situations were chosen. Pollutant concentrations were calculated for each typical and severe situation using the appropriate dispersion model. Emission factors of one gram per mile or minute were used to facilitate scaling. 820788. Comparison of EPA and on-road fuel economy - analysis approaches, trends, and impacts. Barry D. McNutt, U.S. Department of Energy.; Robert Dulla and Robert Crawford, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc.; and H. T. McAdams and Norman Morse, Falcon Re- search and Development Co. This paper is the latest in a series of reports on the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) comparison of Envi- ronmental Protection Agency (EPA) fuel economy esti- mates and on-road fuel economy performance. Earlier reports described a variety of analysis techniques, de- scribed DOE's expanding inuse fuel economy data base, and presented analysis of trends in EPA- versus on-road fuel economy. The focus of this paper is the most recent additions to the data base (including data on light trucks and 1981 model-year cars), the development of DOE analysis techniques, and some of the more interesting trends revealed in this year's analysis. Particular attention is given to model-year and vehicle-type differences, in- cluding driveline technology and model-type trends. The application of these results to improving fuel economy information programs and advertising for consumers is examined. The paper concludes with an analysis of the effect of 110</page><page sequence="92">changing shortfall trends on automotive fuel consumption projections. 820789. On-road fuel economy for 1978-1981 Ford vehicles. James C. McKenna and Neil E. South, Ford Motor Co. Since 1978, Ford Motor Company (Ford) has been collecting and analyzing fuel economy data for Ford vehicles leased by company employes. Survey results for 1978 through 1980 model vehicles were presented in three previous SAE papers, which dealt with the following: on-road mpg performance; comparison of on-road mpg performance to mpg values approved by EPA; and investigation of possible causes of differences between on-road performance and EPA values. Results from Ford's 1981 survey, plus comparisons to earlier surveys, are reported herein. Vehicles driven under "summer" conditions and under "winter" conditions are evaluated separately to determine their relative contribution to an overall, seasonally- weighted difference between EPA and on-road fuel economy. 820790. In-use fuel economy of 1981 passenger cars. R. W. Schneider, W. S. Freas, and T. P. McMahon, General Motors Corp. An owner survey was conducted to determine the owner-measured in-use fuel economy of 1981 model passenger cars. The in-use fuel economy has been compared to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) fuel economy ratings. Data were analyzed to compare the influence of vehicle design parameters on the difference between in-use fuel economy and the EPA ratings. An analysis was also done to allow comparisons of in-use fuel economy from this survey with the results of a previously reported survey on 1980 models. 820791. Why vehicles don't achieve the EPA MPG on the road and how that shortfall can be accounted for. Karl H. Hellman and J. Dillard Murrell, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. This paper discusses the several reasons why vehicles do not achieve the EPA MPG values in service, and makes a numerical estimate of the magnitude of the individual effects. In addition, methods for adjusting EPA MPG values to estimate road fuel economy performance are presented and discussed. 820792. Consumer response to fuel economy information - alternative sources, uses, and formats. Diane Pirkey and Barry McNutt, U.S. Department of Energy.; John Hemphill, J. D. Power and Associates.; and Robert Dulla, Energy and Environmental Analysis, Inc. As part of a cooperative project with the Environmental Protection Agency the Department of Energy has con- ducted an analysis of consumer response to fuel economy information. The study examined consumer needs and level of understanding, alternative formats, fuel economy information in advertising and alternatives to the current 820795 Mileage Guide and Fuel Economy Label. The study techniques included a review advertising in the media, interviews with auto manufacturers' advertising depart- ments, consumer surveys and focus group discussions with consumers and auto dealers. This paper presents the major quantitative and qualitative results with emphasis on (1) how the current Federal Fuel Economy Information Program fits into the overall fuel economy picture and (2) what kind of changes to the program could improve its effectiveness or reduce its cost. 820793. Materials for panel damping in motor vehicles. René Zimmerli, Interkeller AG, Consultant to Globe Industries, Inc. This paper describes the application possibilities of materials for panel damping in modern motor vehicle construction. The basic parameters which govern damping are given; it is shown how they relate to motor vehicles. Two laboratory test methods are discussed for deter- mining the damping performance of materials typically used in motor vehicles. Examples of the effectiveness of such treatment in the motor vehicle under normal operating conditions is presented and discussed. The influence of damping materials when combined with other typical noise control materials is shown in regards to performance and weight optimization. 820794. Gasoline-equivalent fuel economy determination for alternate automotive fuels. Craig A. Harvey, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Due to the growing use of alternate automotive fuels, it is necessary that the U.S. EPA provide a method of calculating fuel economy values for vehicles using these fuels so that equitable average fuel economies can be determined. The relevant legislation is reviewed, and various methodologies are discussed. Possible fuel equivalency factors are presented for Diesel fuel, ethanol, methanol, gasohol, and natural gas/ The methodologies considered range from the simplest (using the ratio of fuel heating values) to the more complex (attempting to account for processing energy and raw material differences). 820795. The BELTFIT program for making seat belts safer and more comfortable. David Sheppard, Mathematical Services Department, The Motor Industry Research Association, Nuneaton, Eng- land. MIRA has developed the BELTFIT program for pre- dicting whether a proposed seat belt layout will suit all wearers. BELTFIT assesses any combination of anchorage locations, seat position, seat angles and stalk length. The program predicts the belt paths on selected wearers and checks them for comfort and safety. European manufacturers are already using BELTFIT to improve the belt layouts on their new vehicles. Further development of the program is in hand.

Bigelow, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, U.S. Dept. of Transpor- tation. Increasing the use of safety belts and child safety seats in motor vehicles is one of the most important public health goals of the nation. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is conducting a research program designed to increase use of restraints. In addition to tracking usage levels and trends - both nationally and in connection with specific projects - the program explores relevant moti- vational factors, assesses the relative effectiveness of various incentive and education approaches, and devel- opment of specially designed approaches for critical target audiences. Preliminary results are encouraging and indi- cate high potential for increasing voluntary belt use. 820798. Alternative measures of restraint system effec- tiveness: interaction with crash severity factors. James O'Day and Jairus Flora, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan. The effectiveness of restraint systems in preventing fatalities or reducing injury has been estimated by extrapolation of data from several sources: (1) Sled tests with dummies (2) Analysis of accident case studies (3) Statistical comparison of belted and unbelted persons in crashed cars. (4) Before and after studies (e.g., with respect to belt-usage legislation, or as with the 1974 starter-interlock program) Fatality reduction estimated by the case study method is on the order of 30 percent, but by the statistical comparison method at 50 percent or sometimes as high as 60 percent. Other differences (e.g., driving habits) between belted and unbelted persons explain the disagreement between the two estimates. More complete analysis of available accident data suggests that the higher values were obtained without correction for such factors as crash severity or occupant age. When such adjustments are introduced into the statistical analysis of accident data, the result is closer to that shown by the case study method. 820799. Plastic developments for European passenger car production in changing times. Hermann Hab- litzel, IVM Technical Consultants Inc., South- field, MI. The euphoric predictions that had been made as regards the increasing use of plastics in this field will not, after all, be fulfilled. There is unlikely to be any appreciable progress in the use of the two favourite materials - unsaturated polyesters and polyurethanes - if basic requirements are not newly worked out. The often repeated mention of the raw material and energy situation leads us nowhere. Development can only be speeded up if one pays due attention to the basic rules underlying the choice of materials, namely technical progress, cost reduction, component optimisation and improved man- ufacturing techniques. Urgent suppositions, which have to be solved, lie in the manufacturing field. Here the preparation for the series have to be made by locally employed teams. Hereby the adaption to costs has to be integrated in todays manufacturing. With regard to the manufacture of large body parts for Europe the following applies: The pressing shop cannot be allowed to die. 820800. Status report on HDPE fuel tanks in European automobiles: characteristics of service life on performance. Klaus-Dieter Johnke and Peter Behr, Passenger Car Development, Volkswagen- werk AG - Wolfsburg, Federal Republic of Germany. New concepts and developments in the field of auto- motive engineering are frequently the result of new types of materials and new processing technologies. These materials and processing methods relate to a sophisticated vehicle concept and the resultant requirements for their use, e.g. on exterior components such as the plastic fuel tank in automotive engineering. This paper discusses the long-term behavior, the basic conditions and the development trends of the HDPE fuel tank in the European automotive engineering. Seen as a whole, there are many different types of materials and production methods used in plastic fuel tanks, which depending on application and function, lead to the necessity of compromises having to be made. It shows, if all the arguments are correctly evaluated, that the plastic fuel tank, providing its properties are systematically exploited, represents an advance for the future development of automotive fuel tank design.

Component as well as product development passes through somewhat different target phases during its journey from prototype to the mass produced end product. The aim i.e. to develop a functional product which is reasonably priced and right for the market, should always be kept in mind by the developes. The weight can be reduced by using plastics materials which, moreover, enable several components to be integrated into one unit. This applies to all the parts of a vehicle. 112</page><page sequence="94">820802. A plastic suspension part? Exploiting oriented FRP materials through innovative manufacturing and computer structural analysis. Jack M. Thompson, Structural Dynamics Research Corp.; and A. Bauer and D. Brodowsky, Volks- wagenwerk AG. The unique properties and manufacturing characteristics of Fiber Reinforced Plastics are exploited in the inno- vative design of a Twist Rear Axle for the Volkswagen Auto 2000 vehicle. The strength, stiffness, cost and packaging requirements can be met only through the use of oriented glass fiber material. The design is practical for mass production within a ten year timeframe. Consid- erable emphasis is placed on the role of Finite Element Analysis in achieving these results. The finished part achieved a 53% mass reduction at a 56% cost increase. The prototype verified the durability predictions of the finite element analysis. 820806. Nylon oil pan testing and design considerations. David L. Anderson, Sealed Power Corporation. Injection molded nylon oil pans for automotive use were tested for impact resistance, oil leakage and bolt torque retention. Impact testing indicates an oil pan fabricated of non-glass filled nylon resin can withstand greater impacts than oil pans constructed of glass reinforced nylon. The impact resistance of nylon pans in a real world envi- ronment remains questionable. Test results also demon- strate, during engine operation in a vehicle, that there is no significant difference between nylon and metal oil pans in oil leakage, oil operating temperature and bolt torque retention when metal flange supports are used. 820807. Car mass and likelihood of occupant fatality. Leonard Evans, Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. The purpose of this work is to estimate the relationship between car mass and the likelihood that a car will have an occupant fatality. Car occupant fatalities in the 1978 Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) data were divided into those killed in two car crashes and those killed in non-two car crashes. The relationship between car mass and the relative likelihood of an occupant fatality in non-two car crashes was determined by examining the number of fatalities in cars of a given mass driven by drivers of a given age divided by an estimate of the number of registered cars of the same mass having owners of the same age. This involves assuming that owners and drivers are the same people - clearly an approximation. This and other assumptions were nec- essary because of data limitations. The relationship between car mass and the relative likelihood of a fatality in a two car crash was determined using the FARS data and the assumption that when cars of the same mass crash, the relative likelihood of an occupant fatality has the same relationship with mass as determined in the non-two car crash analysis. The overall relationship between car mass on likelihood of an occupant fatality was obtained by taking a weighted 820813 average of the non-two car and two car cases. Because occupancy rates depend on car mass, the analysis was performed for drivers only as well as all occupants. This study finds that the likelihood that a car has an occupant or driver fatality is related to the mass of the car. The relationship found may be illustrated by the com- parison of fatality likelihoods in 900 kg and 1800 kg cars shown below. 820808. Productivity - the overall goal. Keith E. McKee and Carol J. Sessions, Manufacturing Produc- tivity Center, IIT Research Institute, Chicago, IL. The United States has long been the most productive nation. On a more personal level, the superior productivity of this nation has given American citizens a standard of living which has been the envy of the rest of the world. Overall national productivity depends on the performance of all economic sectors within the United States. The goods producing sectors, e.g., manufacturing, mining, and agriculture, are of particular importance since output of these sectors enters international trade. Consideration of productivity at a national level is interesting but gives little indication of what can be done. Improving productivity among plants, companies, and industries requires actions at every level starting with the individual employee. Quality of work life can be valuable to the extent that it allows individuals to maximize their contributions to the goals of the company. Herein, productivity is discussed with emphasis on variations between nations and indus- tries, but everyone should remember that improved productivity is the overall goal. 820810. Advances in truck rim technology. Charles B. Watkins, Howard Univ., Washington, DC.; and Steven W. Blate, Firestone Steel Products Co., Akron, OH. The current state of the art in truck wheel technology is reviewed with particular emphasis on rims. The salient design features of both single and multipiece rim types are described and the safety of both types in the context of field performance is explored. Some aspects of contem- porary design methodology are discussed and possible future directions for the technology are forecast. 820813. Diesel particulates and bioassay effect of fuels, vehicles, and ambient temperature. D. E. Seiz- inger, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Bartlesville Energy Technology Center.; T. M.

McClellan, Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute, Lovelace Biomedical &amp; En- 113</page><page sequence="95">820813 vironmental Research Institute. Diesel particulate and gaseous emissions, fuel economy, and mutagenic activity of the particulate extracts were measured for 22 light-duty diesel vehicles representing 1979 through 1982 model-year production of domestics and imports. These vehicles were operated on a chassis dynamometer in a temperature controlled environment. The objectives of this study included measuring effects of fuel aromaticity [0 to 37%], ambient test temperature [25, 50, 75, and 100°F], and vehicle duty cycle on particulate emissions and associated biological activity. Results of this investigation showed that ambient temperature environmental changes on the operating vehicle had virtually no effect on particulate and muta- genicity measurements. Increasing fuel aromaticity in three test vehicles did not show a definitive relationship of particulate level versus fuel aromaticity. The influence of driving cycle on particulate emissions showed the partic- ulate level and mutagenic activity were greater with the New York City Cycle than either Federal Test Procedure cycle or Highway Fuel Economy Test cycle. Mutagenic assessment of particulate extracts which had been sepa- rated into six HPLC fractions showed 90+ percent of the direct acting mutagenicity was contained in three of the six fractions. 820814. The distribution of the inflation forces on the structural members of a radial tire. Robert W. French and James D. Gardner, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. This paper describes the forces that exist in the structural members of a radial tire and the rim flange due to inflation pressure. The forces are determined utilizing the statics of a rigid body approach that assumes that at any given point in time a rigid structure exists. By analyzing the forces contained in varying free body diagrams, a system of simultaneous equations has been developed. Solving the systems of equations yields the force in each of the components of the tire for a given inflation pressure or conversely, given the strength of the component, the pressure at which the tire will burst can be calculated. Extensive testing has been carried out and excellent correlation exists between the theoretical model and the empirical results. The mathematical model described by this paper is meaningful to the tire engineer. 820815. Electric vehicle performance and economics. Walter J. Dippold, Test and Evaluation Branch, Dept. of Energy /Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Div. Recommendations to improve the utilization of currently available battery technology have been made. Use of a thermally controlled environment for the EV propulsion battery, electrolyte stirring, and maintenance time reduc- tions are predicted to make electric vehicles desirable for urban commercial applications. 820816. Electronic component testing and design practices for EMC. A. D. Nielsen, Electrical and Elec- tronics Division, Ford Motor Company. This paper presents an Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) Test Plan and Procedure for automotive electronic components which predicts the EMC performance in a vehicle. Production representative vehicles for EMC evaluation are often not available in sufficient quantities until late in an electronic component design stage where changes are most costly. This Test Plan and Procedure addresses this problem by allowing early detection and definition of component design deficiencies. Also pre- sented are vehicle and electronic component EMC design practices with low cost being a prime consideration. These practices have been proven effective in the most hostile vehicle noise environments on a number of automotive electronic systems. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820817. The final proof - engineering plastic body panels. J. M. Wood and M. H. Radley, General Electric Plastics B.V. The paper discusses the development and thinking behind the construction of the T.R.X. sports car which features external body panels in engineering thermosplastics. The advantages of injection moulding as a high quality mass production process ensuring perfect reproducibility and close tolerance fits are stressed. High weight reduc- tions are possible against conventional materials and many examples are given. High speed, high quality production at a rate commensurate with modern car build is possible with technology currently available and in place today. Finally, alternative construction concepts are discussed to meet a wide range of industry requirements for automotive body components. 820819. The efficacy of seat belt legislation. John G. U. Adams, Geography Department, University College London. The countries surveyed in this paper contain over 80 per cent of the world's car population. Most of them experienced a substantial decrease in road accident fatalities after the 1973 oil crisis. The decrease was greater in those countries that did not pass seat belt laws than in those that did. This paper proffers the hypothesis that protecting car occupants from the consequences of bad driving en- courages bad driving. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820830. Cardiovascular , adaptation to weightlessness. C. Gunnar Blomqvist, Weinberger Laboratory for Cardiopulmonary Research and the Harry S. Moss Heart Center, Southwestern Medical School, University of Texas Health Science Center, Dallas, TX. Exposure to actual and simulated zero gravity causes a significant central or cephalad shift of intravascular and interstitial fluid which triggers a complex set of cardi- 114</page><page sequence="96">ovascular and systemic adaptations. These adaptations are, in turn, directly responsible for the cardiovascular dysfunction that is apparent after return to normal gravity. However, critical information on several impor- tant adaptive mechanisms is incomplete or lacking. An attempt will be made to resolve these problems during a future dedicated life sciences Space Shuttle flight. A series of cardiovascular experiments will utilize direct measurements of central venous pressures, cross-sectional echocardiography, and non-invasive measurements of systemic and peripheral blood flow at rest and during stress. Autonomic control mechanisms will be studied in detail. 820831. Metabolic experiments on Spacelab-4. Carolyn S. Leach, Biomedical Laboratories Branch, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX. Studies of human metabolism are being considered in five experiments. These investigations address physiological effects of zero gravity which have become evident in previous manned space flights, namely, negative Na, Ca and N balances, the resorption of bone, loss of red cell mass, cephalad migration of body fluids, and a shift in water balance. Although these effects have been fairly well established by pre- and postflight measurements, details of the mechanisms by which they occur remain largely unknown. Moreover, the data collected inflight, partic- ularly during the first few hours of weightlessness, have been severely limited both in the amount of quantitative information obtained and with respect to the relative simplicity of the experimental techniques employed. During the Spacelab 4 mission, the acute stage of the response to zero gravity will be the main focus of attention of several experiments. Measurements conducted later in the mission will center on the adaptive phase of metabolic responses. 820832. Fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in space: a primate model to look at mechanisms. Martin C. Moore-Ede and Susanne E. Churchill, Dept. of Physiology and Biophysics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.; Carolyn S. Leach, NASA, LB J Space Center, Houston, TX.; Frank M. Sulzman, Dept. of Biologial Scierïces, SUNY, Binghamton, NY.; Charles A. Fuller, Div. of Biomedical Sciences, Univ. of California at Riverside, Riverside, CA.; and David Kass, Dept. of Medicine, George Washington Univ. Medical Center, Washington, DC. To elucidate the physiological mechanisms involved in the cardiovascular and renal responses to spaceflight, we have developed a ground-based primate model which uses lower body positive pressure (LBPP) to simulate the chronic central vascular expansion associated with weight- lessness. Four male squirrel monkeys with chronically implanted arterial and venous catheters and the capacity for continuous urine collection were subjected to LBPP for 4 days. Onset of LBPP resulted in an immediate diuresis, natriuresis and kaliuresis and a significant fall in 820836 plasma aldosterone and potassium levels. By day 2 the level of natriuresis had decreased by half, while potassium excretion and plasma aldosterone values had returned to control levels despite the persistence of a significantly reduced plasma potassium concentration. We conclude that the low plasma potassium level appears not to stimulate a compensatory fall in plasma aldosterone because of the simultaneous presence of body volume contraction acting to raise aldosterone levels. 820833. Space motion sickness and vestibular experiments in Spacelab. Charles M. Oman, Dept. of Aero- nautics and Astronautics, Massachusetts Insti- tute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. Approximately 43 percent of Apollo, Skylab, Soyuz/ Salyut and Shuttle crewmen have experienced symptoms resembling motion sickness during their first several days in space. This paper reviews the space sickness problem in both an operational and physiological context, and describes experiments planned by a team of vestibular researchers from the USA and Canada to study space sickness and associated sensory-motor adaptation to weightlessness during Spacelab missions 1 and 4, and the German Spacelab mission D-l. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820834. Life Sciences experiments for a space plat- form/station. Jill D. Fabricant, Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health, Univ. of Texas, Medical Branch, Galveston, TX. In the future, there will be a continued presence of man in space. This may become realized with a simple platform, or possibly with a fully developed space station. In any case, the Life Sciences Division of NASA sees an opportunity for future studies involving long duration 0 gravity exposure. Because of the automation required for an unmanned, man-visited platform, it appears to be the greatest challenge. Thus, this paper will discuss the type pf space platform/station presently being considered, the kind of life sciences facility (or laboratory) which would be required, and the scientific questions and experiments which might be carried out on a space platform/station. The need for a space platform/station for Life Sciences is also addressed as well as specific animal requirements. 820836. Thermal control system for a Manned Space Station. Ross J. Cushman, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. This paper describes the thermal control system designed to provide environmental and equipment cooling for a Manned Space Station. Ventilation flow patterns have been selected which maintain a comfortable shirt sleeve environment in zero gravity while providing contaminant process flow, as well as the versatility of providing both distributed and localized equipment cooling. The paper also describes process flow systems and equipment required to remove thermal, humidity, and contaminant loads. How the equipment interfaces with a liquid cooling loop system is detailed, including how thermo-electric 115</page><page sequence="97">820836 heat pumps were included for use during degraded operations. 820837. Zero gravity and life support systems - friends or foes?Raymond B. Trusch, Hamilton Standard, Division of United Technologies Corp. Manned spacecraft life support systems must operate in a zero gravity environment. Lack of the "pull" of gravity affects heat and mass transfer, fluid transport, phase change, and chemical and electrochemical processes. This paper covers new concepts necessary for humidity control, evaporative coolers, distillation units, and similar equip- ment required for spacecraft life support. Specific appli- cations used on the Space Shuttle and in development for advanced regenerative systems are discussed, including how they work, how they are 'tested on earth, and how much, if at all, the weightless environment penalizes the designs. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820838. Space Shuttle Orbiter auxiliary power unit. R. McKenna and L. Wicklund, Sundstrand Energy Systems, Rockford, IL.; J. Baughman, Rockwell International, Downey, CA.; and D. Weary, NASA-JSC, Houston, TX. The Space Shuttle Orbiter auxiliary power units (APUs) provide hydraulic power for the Orbiter vehicle control surfaces (rudder/speed brake, body flap, and elevon actuation systems), main engine gimbaling during ascent, landing gear deployment and steering and braking during landing. Operation occurs during launch/ascent, in-space exercise, re-entry /descent, and landing/rollout. Operational effectiveness of the APU is predicated on reliable, failure-free operation during each flight, mission life (reusability) and serviceability between flights (turna- round). Along with the accumulating flight data base, the status and results of efforts to achieve these long-run objectives is presented. 820839. Space Station crew operations impact on ECLSS design. W. G. Nelson and H. B. Kelly, McDon- nell Douglas Astronautics Co. NASA and the Air Force are currently considering Space Station concepts which feature a wide variety of manned activities including payload operations, command and control, large system deployment, geo-vehicle buildup, and spacecraft servicing and launch. This paper identifies potential mission operations and objectives for these concepts and defines the related crew tasks. Relationships are presented between crew and station operational capabilities. An Environmental Control Life Support Subsystem (ECLSS) is defined and design impacts are identified for each mission type. Crew requirements are synthesized and ECLSS characteristics are presented for each mission type. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820840. A large RF Radiating Membrane for space application. R. L. Bocchicchio and J. A. Quad- rini, Grumman Aerospace Corp., Bethpage, NY. Studies at the Grumman Aerospace Corporation have shown that a space-based radar can provide surveillance for a variety of missions. The Phased Array Membrane Development Program has established the feasibility of developing a key element of the Space Based Radar (SBR), the Radiating Membrane. The subject of this paper is the thermal design and analysis approach used for the Phased Array (Radiating) Membrane Program test article. The primary objective of the thermal effort has been to define a passive thermal design for the test article that is compatible with the space environment for an extended mission period. The Thermal Test portion of the Radiating Membrane Program successfully accomplished the goal of simulating worst case membrane temperatures for the purpose of evaluating and correlating structural models. 820841. Application of the turbo-refrigerator to long-term cryogenic storage. P. G. Wapato, R. H. Norman, and K. P. Barr, Heat Transfer and Cryogenic Systems, AiResearch Manufacturing Co., A Division of The Garrett Corp., Torrance, CA. Storage of cryogenic fluids in space for long periods is being considered in some mission plans. Weight penalty due to fluid vent loss can be high when lengthy periods of low usage are desired. Launch weight may be minimized by active refrigeration of the stored cryogen. The turbo-refrigerator is a closed-cycle cryogenic cooler well suited to such applications. Since this approach is based on the use of gas-bearing turbo-machinery, life limitation due to wear is virtually absent, making extremely long periods of uninterrupted operation feasible. Long-term storage of hydrogen and oxygen is investigated, showing that, for a one-year mission, refrigerated storage results in lower weight for usable liquid hydrogen quantities above 3500 lb; liquid oxygen storage penalties are less, irre- spective of the quantity, at this mission duration. 820842. A near omnidirectional sunshade for cryogenic instruments. H. B. Warner, Hughes Aircraft Co., Culver City, CA. A sunshield has been designed that minimizes the heat load on a space telescope that uses cryogenically cooled mirrors. It shades the solar radiation from any direction except for a small solid angle about the line of sight. This design allows great freedom in pointing a cold telescope-like sensor with respect to the sun since it employs a much shorter, smaller and lighter sunshade than that which has been previously available. It requires no external cooling system and does not add significantly to the heat load. 820843. Low cost cold plate approach for large space platforms. L. R. Price, N. J. Leindecker, and L. P. Morata, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. Present spacecraft cold-plate designs are small in size, relatively complex, and expensive. A new large-size, 116</page><page sequence="98">low-cost approach is required for the new generation of space power modules and platforms. This paper describes an on-going investigation of the feasibility of utilizing large cross-section aluminum extrusions attached side by side to form a large, two-sided cold plate with integral coolant passages. This simply formed assembly provides the thermal and structural characteristics to meet space- craft requirements. This same approach is also applicable to two-sided spacecraft radiators. 820844. Thermal control subsystem for free flying satel- lites. Bob J. Jackson and David Rogers, Sund- strand Corp., Rockford, IL. The design, fabrication, development testing, and growth potential of an advanced design thermal control subsys- tem for the free flying P80-2 satellite is described. Free flying satellite applications can have large payload heat rejection requirements. For example, the P80-2 heat rejection requirement was in excess of 4 kilowatts. An inherent requirement for these vehicles is to incorporate a means for transferring heat from a source, frequently electronic components, to a sink, typically a space radiator. This heat transfer can be accomplished by a liquid coolant loop that is pumped and temperature controlled by a coolant pumping and conditioning assembly (CPCA) system. Major CPCA components typically include a long life space qualified pump, power inverter, thermal control valve, accumulator, and miscel- laneous sensors. 820845. Study and design of a heat rejection system for advanced spacecraft and payload thermal control. Jean Pierre Bouchez, Thermal and Environ- mental Section, ESA - ESTEC, Noordwijk, The Netherlands.; and Luigi Bussolino, Thermal Control Unit, Aeritalia S.p.A. Settore Spazio, Torino, Italy. The Thermal Control System (TCS) of advanced space- craft, derived from the European Spacelab, shall fulfill extremely demanding requirements in terms of heat rejection capability and operational flexibility. Aeritalia, under a European Space Agency (ESA) contract, has performed several studies providing a general survey of advanced spacecraft and their heat rejection systems; suitable concepts have been investigated, analyzed and selected and requirements have been defined for deeper study and design. A Technology Demonstration Model (TDM) representative in terms of applicable software and hardware of a selected reference heat rejection system has been designed by Aeritalia and will be tested in a later phase with the aim of assessing the performance and validating the utilized technology. This paper summarizes all the study phases from the survey to the reference system definition, the rationale for selection and the description of the design for the TDM, whose devel- opment and manufacturing is nearing completion at Aeritalia. 820848 820846. An integrated regenerative Air Revitalization System for spacecraft. Gary P. Noyes, Dennis B. Heppner, and Franz H. Schubert, Life Systems, Inc., Cleveland, OH.; and Philip D. Quattrone, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. Future long-duration manned space missions will require efficient methods for maintenance of viable atmosphere in spacecraft crew cabins. Life Systems, working with NASA, has been developing an integrated regenerative Air Revitalization System (ARS) for removal of carbon dioxide and water vapor and replenishment of oxygen and nitrogen for spacecraft atmosphere. A one-person-capac- ity experimental ARS (ARX-1) has recently been devel- oped and tested. This paper describes the ARS concept, prior development efforts, design and hardware features of the ARX-1, testing completed, the current test program, and a preliminary design for a one-person flight prototype ARS. 820847. A regenerable solid amine C02 concentrator for space station. Albert M. Boehm, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp., Windsor Locks, CT.; and Robert J. Cusick, Aerospace Technologies/Environmental Con- trol, Crew Systems Div., National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX. A regenerable solid amine C02 control system, which employs water vapor for desorption, is being developed for potential use on long duration space missions. During cyclic operation, C02 is first absorbed from the cabin atmosphere onto the granular amine. Steam is then used to heat the solid amine bed and desorb the C02. This paper describes the solid amine system operation and application to the Shuttle Orbiter, Manned Space Plat- form (MSP) and Space Operations Center (SOC). The importance and interplay of system performance param- eters are presented together with supporting data and design characteristics. 820848. Spacelab ECLS Follow-On Development. Ä. Ingemar Skoog, Dornier System GmbH, Fried- richshafen, Germany. With Spacelab approaching its operational stage, ESA has initiated the Follow-On Development Programme. The future evolution of Spacelab elements in a continued U.S./European cooperation is obviously linked to the U.S. STS evolution and leads from the sortie mode improve- ments (Initial Step) towards pallet systems and module applications in unmanned and manned space platforms (Medium and Far Term Alternatives). The main design driver for the life support system in the Initial Step is the extended mission duration (20 days). This improvement will make Spacelab compatible with the Shuttle EDO. The Medium and Far Term Alternatives are oriented around the Science and Applications Manned Space Platform and the Space Operations Center considering Spacelab module applications for future manned space 117</page><page sequence="99">820848 platforms. The preliminary definition of the design on subsystem level for regenerative life support systems with various degree of closure has been completed in early 1982. 820849. Thermoelectric integrated membrane evaporation water recovery technology. George J. Roebelen, Jr. and Gerard F. Dehner, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp., Windsor Locks, CT.; and H. Eugene Winkler, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX. The recently developed Thermoelectric Integrated Mem- brane Evaporation Subsystem (TIMES) offers a highly competitive approach to water recovery from waste fluids for future on-orbit stations such as the Space Operations Center. Low power, compactness and gravity insensitive operation are featured in this vacuum distillation sub- system that combines a hollow fiber membrane evapo- rator with a thermoelectric heat pump. The hollow fiber elements provide positive liquid/gas phase control with no moving parts other than pumps and an accumulator, thus solving problems inherent in other reclamation subsystem designs. In an extensive test program, over 850 hours of operation were accumulated during which time high quality product water was recovered from both urine and wash water at an average steady state production rate of 2.2' pounds per hour. 820850. Integration of a crewman into a high performance spaceplane. H. R. Griswold and D. S. Stein, Hamilton Standard.; and F. W. Redding, Jr., SRI International. This paper presents preliminary results of a study aimed at specification, selection and preliminary design of sub- systems required to transform maneuvering, reentry body technology into a piloted, high performance Spaceplane, potentially capable of operating throughout cislunar space. This study, under contract to the U.S. Air Force, is being conducted by SRI-International, Hamilton Stan- dard and several other aerospace contractors. Potential Spaceplane applications include placement, support, servicing and retrieval of satellites, and a variety of other military missions. The emphasis in this paper is on key issues relating to integration of the crewman into the vehicle. Issues discussed include environmental con- trol/life support, cabin and spacesuit pressure levels and methods of heat rejection. Human factors issues relating to displays and controls, and prevention of the bends are also presented. Finally, major Spaceplane integration issues, such as center-of-gravity control, and payload and recovery system location are also addressed. 820851. A satellite-service approach for long-duration space platforms. R. J. Dellacamera and L. P. Morata, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., Huntington Beach, CA.; and H. R. Griswold, Hamilton Standard, Windsor Locks, CT. The Space Platform, a new space facility to be carried into orbit, maintained, and logistically supported using the Space Shuttle, would provide electrical power, active thermal control, communications, data management, and orbital attitude control for attached payloads. It also could be expanded in capability to support habitat modules for permanent manned space operations. The Space Platform design includes provisions for on-orbit service and maintenance to extend its operational life through resupply of consumables and changeout of failed items or limited-life components. This paper presents concepts for service and maintenance of Space Platform and reviews specific design considerations for servicea- bility. The satellite-service approach presented takes advantage of astronaut work and decision-making capa- bilities in both intra vehicular and extravehicular (EVA) modes. Projected Space Platform EVA, together with required support equipment including service tools and work aids is described; specific techniques, procedures, timeline estimates, safety considerations, and training requirements are discussed. 820852. An evaluation of microorganisms for unconven- tional food regeneration schemes in CELSS: research recommendations. Barry O. Stokes, Stokes Biochemical Co., Logan, UT.; and Gene R. Petersen, Materials Research &amp; Biotechnol- ogy, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California In- stitute of Technology, Pasadena, CA. In addition to research into high productivity green plant agriculture, unconventional food regeneration approaches are being considered as secondary or even primary food sources for Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems. Based on the evidence that microbial food sources can provide all components necessary for human nutrition, attention needs to be given to conducting satisfactory evaluations of microbial food regeneration. Several schemes are presented including past attempts, present research and novel ideas. Proposed research directions and priorities that would permit a proper analysis of the unconventional approach are also indicated. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820853. SOYCHMBR.I: a model designed for the study of plant growth in a closed chamber. Claire Reinhold, Complex Systems Research Center, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH. SOYCHMBR.I, a model designed to study plant growth in a closed chamber, has been developed based on the work of Meyer et al. and their model SOYMOD/ OARDC. In the development of SOYCHMBR.I, SOYMOD/OARDC has been modified to allow for incorporation of plant-chamber interactions that are important in the closed environment and to update the model so that it adequately represents the current understanding of plant processes. The photosynthetic routine has been replaced by Tenhunen's. The present version of SOYCHMBR.I is described, and the C02 dynamics in three test runs are discussed.

Spitze, Dept. of Chem- istry, San Jose State Univ., San Jose, CA.; and Theodore Wydeven, Extraterrestrial Research Div., NASA-Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. Data for hydroponie plant growth in a manned system test is combined with nutritional recommendations to support trade-off calculations for closed and partially closed life support system scenarios. Published data are used as guidelines for the masses of mineral nutrients needed for higher plant production. The results of calculations based on various scenarios are presented for various combi- nations of plant growth chamber utilization and fraction of mineral recycle. Estimates are made of the masses of material needed to meet human nutritional requirements in the various scenarios. It appears that food production from a plant growth chamber with mineral recycle is favorable to reduction of the total launch weight in missions exceeding 3 years. 820857. Closed microbial ecosystems as gas exchange units in CELSS. Elizabeth A. Kearns and Clair E. Folsome, Exobiology Laboratory, Dept. of Microbiology, Univ. of Hawaii at Manoa, Hon- olulu, HI. Materially closed, energetically open, natural microbial ecosystems, were constructed in flasks and sealed under ambient air. These systems were used to study ecosystem stability, defined as resistance to departure from light energy-driven coupled bioelemental cycling. Since it is closely associated with terrestrial ecology, oxygen concentration was chosen to measure the states of the closed microecosystems. Results indicate that rates of change in p02 are indicators of the states of closed complex natural microsystems. Such systems endure indefinitely and reach oxygen concentrations greater than normal atmospheric p02. In addition, a light energy isolated system yielded an oxygen consumption rate which was used to calculate the apparent quantum energy efficiency, Q. The calculated value, 1.3%, compares favorably with the Q of most terrestrial ecosystems. These studies contribute to general ecosystem analysis and indicate that complex microbial ecosystems could be used as gas exchange mechanisms in closed life support systems. 820860. A heat pipe simulation technique for spacecraft thermal testing under variable orientation. Dario Boggiatto, Piero Messidoro, and Falah Al- Astrabadi, Aeritalia Società Aerospaziale Ita- liana S.p.A., Settore Spazio, Torino, Italy. A technique is presented to test heat pipe equipped spacecraft under any operational sun angle and orien- tation without adversely affecting the S/C power and temperature distribution that can occur when heat pipes 820863 are tilted in a 1-g test environment. The proposed technique is based on a specially designed heater system to simulate the heat pipe performance (i.e. distribution of thermal flux and temperature). The heater system employs temperature predictions generated by computer simula- tion and a mathematical correlation of the performance of real and simulated heat pipes when operated similarly in a horizontal position. 820861. Thermal concepts derived from Spacelab for advanced space stations/platforms. Ernesto Val- lerani, Saverio Lioy, and Blaine Sessions, Aer- italia S.p.A. Settore Spazio, Torino, Italy. Thermal control concepts derived from Spacelab for advanced space stations/platforms are reviewed. Con- cepts discussed are based on trade studies performed to determine the applicability of Spacelab hardware (base- line and modified) to such systems as the American- NASA Space Operations Center (SOC), Science and Application Manned Space Platform (SAMSP) and unmanned platform (SASP) and the European-ESA unmanned Free Flyer Platforms. Design changes to Spacelab hardware and new development items needed to meet the design requirements of space facility concepts are identified. Finally, design preferences and perform- ance predictions for the thermal control concepts of interest are given. Portions of this work have been prepared by Aeritalia for the Follow-On-Development (FOD) Medium Term Study sponsored by the European Space Agency (ESA). 820862. MCS-A thermal control subsystem. D. Chalmers and D. Stümpel, ERNO Raumfahrttechnik GmbH, Bremen, West Germany. In December 1981 the Maritime Communication Satellite MCS-A, was successfully launched on board ARIANE L04 to become the European Space Agency's first commercial telecommunication satellite. Presented in this paper is the history associated with the formulation, development and testing of the Thermal Control Subsys- tem designed for MCS-A, as well as a report from the initial evaluation of its in-orbit performance.

In May 1981 OTS-2, the European Space Agency's (ESA) first experimental telecommunication satellite, success- fully completed its three year Orbital Test Program. The main topic of this paper is the continuing evaluation of the thermal control subsystem, with particular emphasis on the estimation of in-flight degradation rates associated with the various on-board thermo-optical material prop- erties.

Vittorio Marchis, Istituto di Macchine e Motori per Aeromobili, Politec- nico di Torino, Italy. An appropriate selection of control philosophy concepts not only from the system stability point of view but also according to system safety and reliability features is of the most importance in general design of thermal control loops. Interconnection of several loops, presence of many heat sinks (namely space radiators), different heat load profiles due to various mission configuration, spacecraft orientation to sun, need complex control in order to make possible the functioning, even in the extreme working conditions. In the present paper the author, on the basis of the past experience, investigates a wide range of radiator thermal control systems. Free flyers heat rejection systems and their respective control units are investigated in order to focalize their most important features, from the heat rejection capa- bilities and temperature control point of view. A parallel evaluation of the proposed solutions concludes this introductory study and shows some selection criteria among the alternative schemes. 820865. A finite element thermal modelling of modular space radiators. Nicola Nervegna and Ugo Borio, Istituto di Macchine e Motori per Aero- mobili - Politecnico di Torino - Italy. A rigorous study of physical phenomena that characterize the energy transfer in a radiative panel, presents serious problems when, aiming at optimizing feasible design solutions, is oriented to the prognostic evaluation of the overall system performance. Different thermal interaction modes among consti- tutive components (i.e. headers, tubes, fins, honeycombs) and an intrinsically complex geometry make extremely cumbersome, if not impossible, to operate with a math- ematical model featuring infinite degrees of freedom, as is the case for the real system. The need thus arises to build up a model possessing limited degrees of freedom, capable of approximately portraying, yet with specifiable accu- racy, the bulk of physical phenomena that actually evolve in the heat rejection system. In the given frame this work elucidates how the objective may be attained by utilizing the finite element method and how it is also possible to deal with non- linearities stemming from existing boundary conditions. 820866. Chemical defense, environmental control systems study. Frank H. Miller and Peter O. Paxson, Rockwell International, North American Air- craft Operations. A test and analysis program was conducted to establish cockpit agent concentration histories when air from an airfield contaminated with persistent Chemical Warfare (CW) agents enters aircraft cockpits through the engine and ECS. The program, which utilized a CW agent simulant, consisted of aircraft field tests with F-4 and F-lll aircraft, laboratory tests using ECS and cockpit simulators, and development of a computer program to predict cockpit agent concentrations of aircraft operating in CW environments. The results demonstrated that cockpit contamination will occur for all conditions evaluated. However, filters can effectively be used to counteract the agent. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820867. A hybrid facility for the simulation, development, and validation of ECS microprocessor based controls. Brion N. Emde and Adam J. P. Lloyd, Systems Research Group, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. This paper presents an overview of digital microproc- essor-based Environmental Control System (ECS) con- troller development and validation at Boeing. The appli- cation of a hybrid computer simulation laboratory to the development of real-time simulation capability for ECS is described. The approach used to develop microprocessor- based ECS controllers is illustrated by describing the steps which led to the implementation of a fully automatic cabin pressure control system. The approach to validating ECS digital controllers is also discussed. 820868. Aircraft vehicle equipment improvements via microprocessors. G. Kurylowich, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Labs., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.; and A. J. P. Lloyd, Boeing Military Airplane Co., Seattle, WA. . The significant advance in microprocessor technology has been recognized by the aircraft community. Over the past several years, strong interest has been expressed in integrating this technology into vehicle equipment sub- systems. Thus, the analog control technologies of the past are slowly being replaced by digital control. Of interest in this paper are the significant improvements that can be made in the areas of environmental control, crew escape, and brake systems. The areas that are being addressed with respect to the environmental control system are discussed in the paper; the areas of concern are cooling control, simplification of valve design, and fault detection. The current problems in relation to crew escape and braking systems are described. The manner in which microprocessor technology can relieve these problems are presented. Work in this area by the Boeing Company is also described. 820869. Environmental control of an aircraft pod mounted electronics system. Tim Morris, William Godecker, Larry Crowe, and Mark W. Metzler, Sundstrand Aviation Mechanical, Unit of Sund- strand Corp., Rockford, IL. A new electronics system is being developed to add all weather navigation and attack capabilities to the USAF F-16 aircraft. This system will be mounted under the aircraft in two removable pods, each of which will carry a 120</page><page sequence="102">self-contained environmental control unit (ECU). The extreme mission duty cycle and sophistication of this system results in some unique challenges in the speci- fication and design of this next generation pod mounted ECU package. These include a small high density ECU package, sizing the ECU based on detailed transient performance requirements, and a nontraditional approach to enable the ECU vapor cycle refrigeration system to operate at low ambient temperatures. This paper outlines the ECU requirements, describes the resulting ECU design concepts and configuration, and makes some recommendations for future applications of similar sys- tems. 820870. ECS schemes for all electric airliners. Fred M. Rosenbush, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp., Windsor Locks, CT. This paper introduces the concepts and state-of-the-art advances on which the All-Electric Airliners will be based, discusses present practice and experience in the design of ECS and derives some ground rules and guidelines for generating new ECS schemes. Based on these, two examples of system schematic layout (Vapor Cycle and Recircair) are presented. Innovative development needed for execution of the systems is highlighted. The conclusion is that the systems are feasible and advantageous, but work on translating into practice should be started as soon as possible. 820871. Thermal design of integrated avionic racks for aircraft. Vincent Cirrito, Thermodynamics Dept., Grumman Aerospace Corp., Bethpage, NY. The thermal design of integrated avionic racks for aircraft installation must be evaluated from a total systems integration vantage point. The thermal design parameters are the drivers that will dictate the maximum allowable module power for reliability and avionic partitioning. Therefore, the objective of the thermal design procedure must be to provide a system configuration with maximum reliability and minimum aircraft penalty and life cycle costs. As part of the Integrated Rack Concept Study in V/STOL Type Aircraft a procedure was developed and applied to module configurations with chip carrier semiconductor devices. The cooling air requirement at the aircraft environ- mental control system interface was defined as a function of air supply temperature. 820872. Supercritical water oxidation for wastewater treatment: preliminary study of urea destruction. Susan H. Timberlake, Glenn T. Hong, Morris Simson, and Michael Modell, MODAR, Inc., Natick, MA. Supercritical water oxidation is being investigated as a method of treating spacecraft wastewater for recycle. In this process, oxidation is conducted in an aqueous phase maintained above the critical temperature (374°C) and pressure (215 bar) of water. Organic materials are oxidized 820875 with efficiencies greater than 99.99% in residence times of less than 1 minute. This paper presents preliminary results for urea destruction. Above 650° C, urea can be com- pletely broken down to nitrogen gas, carbon dioxide and water by supercritical water oxidation, without the use of a specific catalyst. 820873. A flow-system comparison of the reactivities of calcium superoxide and potassium superoxide with carbon dioxide and water vapor. P. C. Wood, E. V. Bailou, and L. A. Spitze, Dept. of Chemistry, San Jose State Univ., San Jose, CA.; and T. Wydeven, Advanced Life Support Office, Ames Research Center, NASA, Moffett Field, CA. Superoxides can be used in self-contained, emergency self-rescuers, both as sources of chemically stored oxygen and as carbon dioxide scrubbers. In the work described here, a single-pass flow-system test facility was employed to evaluate the reactivity of calcium superoxide, Ca(02)2, with respiratory gases (H20,C02), in concentrations simulating exhaled breath. When compared with com- mercial preparations of potassium superoxide, K02, 55-60% Ca(02)2 was found to evolve oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide at significantly lower rates under condi- tions where each of the superoxides was reacted with 5% C02 streams having dew points of 37 °C. Whereas 02 evolution and C02 absorption occurred simultaneously in the case of K02 beds, C02 absorption lagged 02 evolution when beds of Ca(02)2 were reacted with moisture and C02. It is postulated that hydration of the calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, and calcium peroxide, Ca02, formed as a product of the Ca(02)2-H20 reaction, is necessary to the reactivity of Ca(02)2 preparations with C02.

A molten carbonate fuel cell has been successfully tested as a carbon dioxide concentrator. We, here, examine cathode performance in terms of removal efficiency, voltage loss and current efficiency at oxidant C02 levels typical of manned space cabin atmospheres. A system design based on this concept has the potential advantages of small size, low component cost and high current efficiency at low-C02 levels. The disadvantages arrive from the penalties associated with the high-temperature operation. 820875. Utilization of ruthenium and ruthenium-iron alloys as Bosch process catalysts. Chartsiri Sophonpanich, Michael P. Manning, and Robert C. Reid, Department of Chemical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cam- bridge, MA. The Bosch process has been considered as a means to recover oxygen from metabolic carbon dioxide through 121</page><page sequence="103">820875 the catalytic production of water. Previous investigations have shown that the oxide formation accounts for the limited activity of the iron catalyst. On the other hand, the maximum water concentrations achievable in the nickel and cobalt systems have been shown to correspond to the carbide formation. This paper presents the results of an experimental study carried out to determine the effec- tiveness of ruthenium and its alloy with iron as alternative Bosch catalysts. Carbon deposition boundaries over the alloy catalysts are reported. 820876. Environmental testing of escape breathing appa- ratus. Jerry W. Stengel, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. A new generation of 60-minute self-contained breathing apparatus was being introduced into the underground coal mining industry for use as respiratory protection during fires and mine disasters. Little field experience existed from which to predict the survivability of this new life-support equipment. A series of environmental tests was proposed consisting of exposure to heat, cold, shock, and vibration. Treated and untreated apparatus were evaluated and compared by use on human subjects and a mechanical breathing simulator. Results are reported. After field data has been collected, information may be able to be correlated with environmental testing and used as a predictor of survivability. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820877. Evaluating Scroll refrigerant compressors for reducing size and weight of military aircraft ECS. J. E. McCullough, J. T. Dieckmann, T. P. Hosmer, and A. H. Post, Jr., Arthur D. Little, Inc., Acorn Park, Cambridge, MA. A pod-mounted aircraft environmental control system, incorporating a two-stage Scroll-type refrigerant com- pressor, was designed to achieve minimum weight, volume, and electric power input. Alternative thermo- dynamic cycles, common refrigerants and azeotropes, capacity controls, cooling techniques, operating speeds, and pressure ratios were evaluated. A breadboard Scroll compressor design was completed. In the next phases of this hardware program, two prototype compressors will be fabricated and tested to evaluate performance. 820878. Thermal design of standard avionic enclosures. James L. Franklin and Ted J. Kramer, Boeing Aerospace Co. This paper details the development of standardized avionic enclosures for Naval aircraft, with particular emphasis on the package's thermal design. The packaging system is unique in that it can accommodate modules of two different standardized sizes (ISEM-2A and 1/2 ATR), and modules having three different cooling modes -conduction cooled, flowthrough cooled, and heat pipe cooled. The three module cooling modes, together with required package dissipation rates of 125 watts/MCU and pressure drops below 2.8mm mercury create a great deal of complexity in the optimization of the thermal system. A computerized optimization program was therefore utilized to achieve specific designs, with results reported for various module mixes and heat exchanger designs. 820879. Anti-icing system design and test optimization. Thomas V. Radovich and William B. Murtha, Martin Marietta Corp., Baltimore Aerospace Div., Baltimore, MD. An anti-icing system design and test optimization ap- proach is described which is applicable to shipboard or ground missile launcher components where motion is critical. Analytical thermal modeling techniques were utilized to perform design tradeoffs and establish baseline design details and operating power requirements. A special test facility was developed for anti-icing system checkout. This facility was used to verify environmental boundary conditions (e.g., heat transfer coefficients), determine ice formation patterns, provide temperature data for analytical model correlation, and optimize power requirements. This paper encompasses the anti-icing system design, the facility development, and the operating test results. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820880. Environmental protection system for the Shuttle External Tank Aft Cargo Carrier. B. F. Elam and T. B. Mobley, Martin Marietta Corp., Michoud Operations, New Orleans, LA.; and J. D. Warmbrod, REMTECH, Inc., Huntsville, AL. The Shuttle External Tank (ET) can be extended by adding an Aft Cargo Carrier (ACC) approximately 33 ' in length in order to provide added volume for payloads. The ACC doubles the current Shuttle payload volume, pro- vides flexibility in payload manifesting, and can be utilized for hazardous payloads. This paper presents the major environmental design requirements for the ACC, and discusses the preliminary design accomplished to meet the most demanding requirement: the increased thermal and acoustic environments. Candidate environ- mental protection concepts that combine acoustic and thermal protection materials are described, and the more promising selected for testing. 820881. Hyperthermal environment simulation for devel- opment of thermal protection systems. R. A. Williamson, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis, MO. Arc heater facilities have been developed to simulate entry environments for nosetip and heat shield materials. Discussed in this paper is a recent advancement for testing 1 in. diameter models at pressures to 156 atm by using a cold gas shroud to confine the hot core to the boundary layer of the model, thereby minimizing the power requirement. Results of large and small model tests are presented. Also included are results of heat shield materials tested at heating rates from 500 to 5000 Btu/ft2s showing comparable performance using two different arc heaters and two model sizes. 122</page><page sequence="104">820882. Shuttle orbiter atmospheric revitalization pressure control subsystem. James J. Walleshauser and George R. Ord, Carleton Controls Corp.; and R. Norman Prince, NASA/Johnson Space Center. The Atmospheric Revitalization Pressure Control Sub- system (ARPCS) provides oxygen partial pressure and total pressure control for the habitable atmosphere of the Shuttle for either a one atmosphere environment or an emergency 8 PSIA mode. It consists of a Supply Panel, Control Panel, Cabin Pressure Relief Valves and Elec- tronic Controllers. The panels control and monitor the oxygen and nitrogen supplies. The cabin pressure relief valves protect the habitable environment from overpres- surization. Electronic controllers provide proper mixing of the two gases. This paper describes the ARPCS, addresses the changes in hardware that have occurred since the inception of the program; the performance of this subsystem during STS-1 and STS-2; and discusses future operation modes. 820883. Shuttle orbiter flash evaporator operational flight test performance. John R. Nason, Hamilton Standard, Division of United Technologies Corp.; and Albert F. Behrend, Jr., Johnson Space Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Flash Evaporator System (FES) is part of the Shuttle Orbiter Active Thermal Control Subsystem. The FES provides total heat rejection for the vehicle Freon Coolant Loops during ascent and entry and supplementary heat rejection during orbital mission phases. This paper reviews the performance of the FES during the first two Shuttle orbital missions (STS-1 and STS-2). A comparison of actual mission performance against design requirements is presented. Mission profiles (including Freon inlet tem- perature and feedwater pressure transients), control temperature, and heat load variations are evaluated. Anomalies that occurred during STS-2 are discussed along with the procedures conducted, both in-flight and post- flight, to isolate the causes. Finally, the causes of the anomalies and resulting corrective action taken for STS-3 and subsequent flights are presented. 820884. Spacelab ECLS current status. Peter Lauten- bach, Dornier System GmbH, Friedrichshafen, Germany. The Spacelab Environmental Control/Life Support Sub- system (ECLS) provides an earthlike "shirtsleeve" envi- ronment in the Spacelab cabin compatible with the atmosphere of the Orbiter crew compartment. This paper describes the major ECLS functions with particular respect to the current Flight Unit hardware status. It also includes recent design modifications, improvements, and adaptations resulting from Spacelab qualification and integration. ECLS potential atmospheric interaction with the Orbiter ECS is presented as well. In the course of extensive performance testing, the Spacelab ECLS design has proven its capability to meet specified performance and to provide adequate operational support. 820888 820885. Shuttle water spray boiler flight performance. E. W. O'Connor and D. W. Rethke, Hamilton Standard, Division of United Technologies Corp. The Water Spray Boiler (WSB) is a completely self- contained system which provides an expendable heat sink for each Shuttle Orbiter Hydraulic System and Auxiliary Power Unit (APU). At the heart of the system is the tube-bundle boiler which rejects heat by pool boiling on the ground and by impingement spray boiling in space. This paper describes the system and addresses flight performance during STS-1, STS-2, and STS-3. 820886. Qualification of the Space Shuttle Orbiter Radiator system. H. R. Howell and J. L. Williams, Vought Corp., Dallas, TX. The Space Shuttle Orbiter Radiator and Flow Control Assembly have been structurally and thermally qualified for operational flight through a series of element and individual panel ground tests and flight tests. Extensive analyses in conjunction with the testing provided a weight optimum system without the excessive over design usually associated with large systems which operate in environ- ments that are difficult to simulate. The initial two flight tests of the Orbiter have verified the test and analyses procedure. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820887. Waste collector operation in STS. R. W. Murray and J. K. Mangialardi, General Electric Co., Valley Forge Space Center.; M. E. Mcintosh and T. J. Vaughn, Rockwell International, Space Div.; and H. A. Rotter, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. The Shuttle Orbiter Waste Collector Subsystem (WCS) is an integrated multi-functional zero gravity operational device utilized to collect and process biowastes from both males and females, wash water from the Personal Hygiene Station (PHS), gases from Wet Trash Stowage, water from the Extravehicular Maneuvering Unit (EMU), and emesis filled bags. The first flight of the Space Transportation System (STS-1) revealed several problems mostly related to unexpected amounts of cabin debris. This paper discusses the process of problem definition and resolution, and the results from subsequent flights. Additionally, detailed descriptions of the system in normal and redundant modes of operation are presented. 820888. A qualitative analysis of gas exchange in closed ecological life support systems. Robert Kauf- mann, Berrien Moore, III, and M. M. Averner, Complex Systems Research Center, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH. Research directed at the development of a Closed Ecological Life Support System (CELSS) has been initiated by NASA. Such systems will provide life support supplies for long duration missions through a combination 123</page><page sequence="105">820888 of biological and physico-chemical processes which will regenerate potable water, a balanced diet, and breathable atmospheres. Research on one aspect of a CELSS, the stability of atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide, indicates that autotroph/heterotroph systems closed to the exchange of gas with the external atmosphere show wide fluctuations in atmosphere composition. The causes of this instability are many and their effects must be mitigated if atmospheric stability in a CELSS is to be realized. It is suggested that control strategies be devel- oped based upon a consideration of gas exchange rates and ratios, and preventing the accumulation of important chemical species in system sinks. 820896.

This paper discusses the current status of worldwide automotive electronics applications beginning with a perspective on the accomplishments achieved to date through joint efforts by the automotive and electronics industries. Specific examples of recent applications which demonstrate a leadership position in the areas of Pow- ertrain, Instrumentation, Vehicle Controls, Convenience and Entertainment are provided. Progress in electronics technology and specific needs for the future are presented and the paper concludes with an assessment of growth and opportunities - emphasizing a trend toward integrated electronic systems applications. 820897. (P-lll) Truck and bus electronics. John F. Ullrich and Alan R. Dohner, International Harvester Co., Hinsdale, IL. Electronic devices have been making rapid inroads in automotive products over the past five years. Gains that have been seen in the passenger car segment will naturally extend to the truck and bus markets. For this extension to be successful, the special needs of the truck and bus customers must be met. This paper summarizes the market segmentation of this industry, surveys currently available electronic products, and indicates probable direction for future developments. The opportunity is present, the technology is ready, and the challenge is to carry out the application of electronic technology judiciously providing the customer with value for his dollar and making him more competitive in an increasingly competitive business environment. 820898.

Kopp, TRW Eagle Con- trols Div., Addison, IL.; and William J. Fleming, TRW Advance Technology Center, Farmington Hills, MI. Application of electronics to agricultural and construction vehicles is shown to be motivated by two basic needs - increased productivity and improved protection. Increases in productivity include gains in both machine perform- ance and operator efficiency. Improved protection in- cludes prevention of expensive machinery failures and more effective safety systems to protect the operator. Reasons for needed improvements in productivity and protection are first described, then several examples are given of current electronic systems used in both agri- cultural and construction equipment. Finally, future electronic systems are considered and many examples of anticipated next-generation agricultural and construction developments are detailed. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820899. (P-lll) Energy storage systems - worldwide. Brian D. Edwards, Lucas Chloride EV Systems Limited, Swinton, Manchester, England. Battery electric vehicle demonstration programmes in USA and Europe have emphasised the need for a robust battery with an acceptable cost per cycle. In the UK in particular, urban delivery vehicles with lead acid batteries are close to commercial viability as replacements for the diesel or gasolene vehicle. Uncertainties on oil availability and price escalation are likely to further increase demand for the battery electric alternative. Advanced battery couples with higher energy densities are necessary for penetration into the high volume vehicle market. Of the many on-going battery programmes, no clear winner has yet emerged. 820900. (P-lll) EEC-FV tomorrow's electronic engine controls today. David F. Hägen and Dennis F. Wilkie, Ford Motor Co., Dearborn, MI. In 1982, Ford Motor Company will introduce its all new fourth generation electronic engine control system, EEC- IV, on selected applications starting with the 1983 1.6L EFI engine on Escort, Lynx, EXP and LN7 passenger cars. The EEC-IV system represents a new state-of-the-art in electronic engine management. EEC-IV was planned and designed to provide the system capability, flexibility, and cost/reliability benefits to satisfy Federal and consumer pressures for improved emissions, economy, and performance for all Ford powertrain and fuel delivery systems through the 198(ys. This paper presents an overview of the electronic engine control technology trends which led to the development of EEC-IV, a review of EEC-IV capabilities and features, and a projection of future powertrain control requirements which could potentially be contained within the design capabilities of EEC-IV.

Major technical advances have been introduced in the area of engine controls over the last several years. General 124</page><page sequence="106">Motors has applied many of these product advances including a digital microcomputer to coordinate the major control functions of the engine's operation: fuel, spark advance, idle speed, EGR, and transmission. Motivation for these advances is based upon maximizing fuel economy and driveability for the customer while achiev- ing effective emission control performance. This paper will provide a description of the systems that have been introduced nationwide in 1981 and 1982 and highlight some of the production activities that were undertaken to ensure quality and reliability. 820902. (P-lll) Single point electronic injection system. T. Toyoda, T. Inoue, and K. Aoki, Higashifuji Technical Center, Toyota Motor Corp. The status of the single point electronic fuel injection system technologies are overviewed. The major techno- logical features of the systems which have been an- nounced or introduced in the market are compared. The merits and the demerits of the various system designs and the components, such as injector position, fuel system pressure, injection nozzle design and sensors are de- scribed. The possibilities to improve the air fuel distri- bution from cylinder to cylinder, the transient response of the engine in the acceleration mode and the stability of the engine revolution during idle with sophisticated control algorythm are demonstrated. The learning control is also very useful to compensate the deterioration of the system or the offset of the control point. In conclusion, compar- ing with multi point injection and carburetor, the single point injection system will take the major position of the fuel supply system for spark ignition engine, though the multi point injection system and the carburetor system still keep their position as a high performance component and a low cost component.

The continuing advances being made in microcomputer technology have resulted in its application to an ever increasing range of control systems. The improved performance and flexibility that would be achieved by a microcomputer based diesel engine fuel system cannot be matched by hydromechanical controls of the type cur- rently used. Before an electronic system can be success- fully introduced in the harsh heavy-duty truck environ- ment, however, it must meet stringent reliability and durability goals at reasonable cost. This paper outlines some of the problems encountered and solutions imple- mented in the design of an electronic fuel pump for this market. 820906. (P-l 1 1) Electronic transmission controls. Vern E. Brooks and Robert Denes, Eaton Corp. This paper briefly summarizes the development history of electronic transmission controls in heavy duty highway vehicles.

Possible new functions beyond the "classical" logic functions are considered for electronic implementation. 820907. (P-lll) Truck electronic engine controls. Jerry R. Blevins and John J. Stephan, TRW Inc. Electronics can control the engine combustion cycle by altering the fuel metering systems and/or fuel injection timing of Heavy Duty Trucks. Precision control based on the particular engine fuel injection requirements may be adapted to specific com- bustion criteria. Driver performance, however, under certain conditions, can be the most influential fuel economy factor. The driver performance element and an electronic control system to optimize that element is discussed. 820908. (P-lll) Vehicle mounted management infor- mation systems. John F. Flick and Jeremy A. Salinger, Rockwell International, Automotive Electronics, Troy, MI. A system has been developed which provides management information about the operation of heavy duty trucks.

These reports provide the necessary information feedback about vehicle operation to decrease operating costs and increase productivity. 820909. (P-lll) Electronic controls for bus, truck and off-highway vehicle transmissions. Kenneth B. Harmon and Keith D. Struthers, Detroit Diesel 125</page><page sequence="107">820909 Allison, Division of General Motors Corp., Indianapolis, IN. Most bus, truck and off-highway vehicle automatic transmissions today have hydraulic controls similar to the type used on automobile transmissions. Because the number of transmission applications is increasing rapidly and customer demands for improved vehicle performance, greater durability and better reliability are growing, present hydraulic controls are being pushed to their capacity. Overall transmission performance can be im- proved by replacing hydraulic controls with electrohy- draulic controls which incorporate microcomputer-based electronics for intelligence, but continue to employ hydraulics for power to apply the clutches in the transmission. Important benefits available with a microcomputer- based controls system include: shift point optimization, improved shift point accuracy, transmission-application customization, mechanical linkage elimination, improved fuel economy, and overall powertrain optimization. 820910. (P-lll) Electronic diesel fuel injection control. Myron U. Trenne, TRW Transportation Elec- tronics Div., Farmington Hills, MI.; and An- drew P. Ives, Lucas Micos Ltd., Cirencester, England. There exists a uniqueness in the diesel engine market that is providing an accelerating force in moving transpor- tation electronics to under hood and on-engine appli- cations. The challenge of this harsh environment is compounded by expectations for life and reliability greater than typical automotive standards. Meeting this challenge impacts the full spectrum of new product development including (1) electronic design and pack- aging, (2) technology application, and (3) manufacturing processes and controls. This paper explores these impacts. 820911. (P-lll) The evolution of the electrically/elec- tronically controlled transmission. Karsten Ehlers, Electric and Electronic Automotive Systems, Volkswagenwerk AG, West Germany. The emphasis of the last decade on vehicle safety and exhaust emissions has changed to an increased priority on lowering fuel consumption; thus, vehicle weight and drag coefficient have become decisive design parameters. Electronic components are replacing their existing electro-mechanical counterparts, resulting in either cost advantages or better or more reliable function. In addition new functions are being introduced which were unat- tainable in the absence of electronics. In the future the functions made possible by electronics may become integral to the mechanical concepts of new designs. This paper considers the transmission as the link between the engine and the vehicle. It details which directions development should follow and how large the potential in each direction is at present. 820912.

The continuing development of microprocessor-based control systems, improved dynamic models for engines and drive-trains, and advanced sensors provides new opportunities for application of modern control theory to automotive systems. Static calibration procedures for engine control systems are susceptable to errors due to transients and gradual variation in system parameters over time. Approaches to these problems using classical feedback and adaptive control strategies are discussed. The use of failure detection theory in developing auto- motive diagnostic systems is proposed as an advanced application of modern control theory. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820914.

Peter Wright, Central Electronics Group, Massey-Ferguson Industries Limited. Several factors (changing operator skills, changing leg- islation, and changing technology among others) are creating the need for improved vehicle diagnostic systems. There are many difficulties in designing good diag- nostic systems that incorporate the optimum compromise between effectiveness in locating a fault, and test hardware overhead. Before such a compromise can be arrived at, it is necessary to move away from the add-on approach to diagnostic hardware, and treat failure detection, isolation, and repair as a total system that pulls together vehicle, dealer, and factory capabilities. 820951. Preliminary tests of two-stroke cycle engines fueled by ethanol/sunflower oil mixtures. Harry G. Gibson, R. Mack Strickland, and Stephen Poe, Dept. of Agricultural Engineering, Purdue Univ., West Lafayette, IN. Two stroke cycle chainsaw engines were tested comparing an ethanol/sunflower oil mixture to a conventional fuel mixture. Preliminary results indicated difficulty in starting below 50°F (10°C), high engine temperatures, gum deposits and possible lubrication breakdown; which indicate potential problems of using this fuel. 820952. Fuel injection of a two-stroke cycle spark ignition engine. R. Douglas, Ford Motor Co., Basildon, Laindon, Essex, England.; and G. P. Blair, 127</page><page sequence="109">820952 Department of Mechanical and Industrial En- gineering, The Queen's University of Belfast, Northern Ireland. A study of fuel injection during the open cycle of a small spark ignition two-stroke cycle engine has been carried out. A manually controlled electronic fuel injection system has been used as this appears to have many advantages over mechanically controlled equipment. Various injec- tion locations were considered and injection timing and air/fuel ratio varied at each position to determine optimum power and bsfc requirements. The results presented are compared with baseline carburation and with fuel injection into the intake to assess the potential improvements gained from each injector location.

Blair, Dept. of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, The Queen's University of Belfast, Northern Ireland. This paper deals with the performance prediction of one member of a family of thrust producing intermittent combustion engines, namely the pulsejet. The first part is concerned with formulating basic concepts of how pulsejets work. It describes the different methods of providing intake valving action and derives theory to demonstrate the operation of the aerodynamic tuned valve in particular. The second part is concerned with devising a com- puter program to simulate and predict the performance of valveless pulsejets. The program is based on the method of characteristics for calculating unsteady gas flow. Theories and techniques are given to handle the major problems associated with this application. These problems include the large range of discontinuous temperature and entropy, flow through an area discontinuity and the calculation of mean thrust. These techniques are incorporated in a computer program, which is successfully used to help with the design of a small valveless pulsejet, which was then built and tested. The duct geometry predicted by the program operates successfully and experimental measurements of pressure variations and mean thrust agree well with those calculated. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820955. Technology status for an advanced supersonic transport. W. T. Rowe, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp., Long Beach, CA. This paper presents an assessment of the current tech- nology for an Advanced Supersonic Transport designed to expand the service now provided by the Concorde. The assessment includes an examination of the improvements in the areas of aerodynamics, materials, structures, acoustics, propulsion, and economics. Significant tech- nology development and testing completed or underway at Douglas Aircraft Company are described along with efforts of government agencies and other major U.S. aircraft and engine companies. Also, improvements in modeling the physical processes of the upper atmosphere and the possibility of pollution by exhaust emission are addressed. The question is not whether but when all these technology developments can be put together to produce an economically viable and environmentally acceptable Advanced Supersonic Transport. For example, a new Douglas baseline design with 350 passengers is defined to show range, fuel efficiency, and productivity gains. Such an airplane opens up the major international city-pair markets of the entire world to fast, efficient transpor- tation. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820956. Applications of advanced upper surface blowing propulsive-lift technology. John A. Cochrane and Dennis W. Riddle, Quiet Short-Haul Aircraft Office, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA.; and Stan Youth, Preliminary Design Department, Boeing Commercial Airplane Co., Seattle, WA. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has conducted research on propulsive-lift techniques for more than 30 years. The success of the flight research program conducted with the Quiet Short-Haul Research Aircraft led to studies of this technology for a business jet and a Short-Haul Transport application. The studies showed that the Short-Haul Transport could operate from a 2500-ft (762.0 m) runway with 95 passengers at low noise levels. Design range was 500 n. mi. but with maximum fuel load the runway length is only increased to 2900 ft (883.9 m) while the range is increased to more than 1000 n. mi. Two business jet designs were studied; one design was based on a 1500-ft (457.2-m) field length and the other was designed for a 2500-ft (762.0-m) field length. As with the Short-Haul Transport, the business jet designed for a 1500-ft (457.2-m) field length can be loaded to maximum fuel capacity. In this case the range increases from 500 n. mi. to 1400 n. mi. while the runway length increases from 1500 ft (457.2 m) to 2075 ft (632.5 m). The business jet studies showed that the application of advanced propul- sive-lift technology to this class aircraft can result in payload-range-speed performance comparable to current aircraft with about one-half the runway length require- ment. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820957. Prop-Fan powered aircraft - an overview. Steven G. Ludemann, Hamilton Standard, Div. of United Technologies Corp., Windsor Locks, CT. The propeller is an inherently more fuel efficient device for powering aircraft than is the jet. However, the increased airspeed capacity of jet engine powered aircraft caused the jet to become the primary method of propul- sion on newly designed aircraft for the last 25 years. The Prop-Fan is an advanced technology propeller which overcomes the deficiencies of older props, and provides significant fuel burn advantage over the most modern jet 128</page><page sequence="110">engines. As Prop-Fan technology is demonstrated and the airlines retain their eagerness to reduce their fuel costs, they must seriously consider returning to propeller-type propulsion for their new aircraft. 820958. Coal liquefaction - impact on the petroleum refiner. D. Crowe and F. M. Dautzenberg, Shell Canada Limited, Toronto, Ontario. An examination of three coal liquefaction technologies exemplified by Fischer-Tropsch, Mobil MTG and SRC-II is made with respect to product quality, yields and their ability to produce products compatible with existing refinery requirements. Indirect liquefaction via Fischer- Tropsch and Mobil MTG were found to produce ac- ceptable products after blending but with a yield structure incompatible with the declining gasoline to distillate ratio in today's market. Direct liquefaction while producing a more flexible boiling range product was found to be totally unacceptable to conventional refinery processing units. This would necessitate the development of dedi- cated upgrading technology, after which it is expected that acceptable gasoline and jet fuel could be produced. SA E Trans., Vol . 91 820959. Natural gas (methane), synthetic natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases as fuels for transpor- tation. R. D. Fleming, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC.; and R. L. Bechtold, Mueller Associates, Inc., Baltimore, MD. Gaseous fuels (natural gas, synthetic natural gas and LP-Gases) used in transportation vehicles are assessed. The fuels' physical properties require larger storage volumes than liquid fuels, posing unique environmental and safety problems. Gaseous fuels provide a significant portion of the U.S. energy supply but increased uses will probably increase imports; production of synthetic nat- ural gas and the development of unconventional gas resources will not prevent imports due to increased demand. Gaseous fuels can allow increased efficiency of spark-ignition Otto Cycle internal combustion engines during warmup at the expense of reduced specific power output. Neat methanol allows increased fuel efficiency and specific power output and is easier to incorporate into a transportation vehicle. Gaseous fuels are best suited to stationary combustion systems served by pipelines. Liquid fuels are better suited to use in transportation; alternative liquid fuels should be developed with transportation use in mind. 820960. Distillate fuels from Green River oil shale. R. F. Sullivan, Process Development Div., Chevron Research Co., Richmond, CA. Shale oil is notable for its high nitrogen content and for large amounts of unsaturated and metallic contaminants. However, although expensive to refine, shale oil can be upgraded to specification transportation fuels using commercially available petroleum processing technology. The key is an effective initial hydrotreating step in which most of the contaminants are removed. The syncrude thus 820965 produced can then be refined in petroleum refineries using conventional technology such as hydro-cracking, catalytic cracking, and catalytic reforming to give specification transportation fuels. This paper discusses upgrading options, the properties of fuels from shale oil, and reviews Chevron's plans for commercial development. 820961. Interior noise of general aviation aircraft. John F. Wilby, Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., Canoga Park, CA. Interior sound levels of general aviation aircraft are reviewed and compared with corresponding levels in commercial aircraft, buses, automobiles and passenger trains. Noise sources are classified into three groups - propulsion system, external flow and on-board equipment - and their frequency characteristics are described. These characteristics include both broadband and discrete frequency components. The main transmission paths associated with the different sources are identified in a general manner. Potential methods for reducing interior noise levels are described with emphasis being placed on two approaches with wide application. One approach is the fuselage sidewall treatment and the other is the use of vibration isolation mounts for the engines. The discussion demonstrates the difficulties involved in achieving large noise reductions at the low frequencies associated with propeller noise and engine out-of-balance forces. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820962. Measuring sound intensity. Gunnar Rasmussen, Brüel &amp; Kj aer, Denmark. We are basically interested in Sound Intensity whenever we deal with sources of sound in noise control. The development of techniques and new tools for the direct measurement of the flow of acoustic energy offer new ways for determination of source location, source ranking, energy flow path and absorption measurements. Optimum microphone probe configurations for different applica- tions, digital processing and data presentation will be discussed. The use of true real time data processing in collection of energy flow data in mechanical structures is suggested as a new tool for the mechanical design engineer. 820963. Recent developments in vehicle interior noise reduction. Makoto Asai and Yuichi Fujii, Toyota Motor Corp. In order to reduce the interior noise of a vehicle with a four-cylinder engine, investigations were made using finite element and vector methods, acoustic intensity testing and holography technique. The investigation resulted in inclination of the engine mounting, design changes to the front suspension mem- ber, a shock absorber engine mounting, structural modi- fications to reduce body panel vibration and a new engine mounting to insulate high freuency engine vibration. 820965. Comparison of aldehyde methods. Kenneth T. Menzies, Kevin J. Beltis, and Rose E. Fasano, Arthur D. Little, Inc. 129</page><page sequence="111">820965 Three widely documented methods for the analysis of aliphatic aldehydes in air, i.e., chromotropic acid, 3- methyl-2-benzothiazolone hydrazone (MBTH) and 2,4 dinitrophenyl hydrazone (DNPH), and a modified version of the MBTH method are frequently used for the analysis of aldehydes in diluted diesel exhaust. In order to assess their relative accuracy for analysis of aldehydes in such a matrix, a side-by-side comparison of the methods was conducted. The equivalent accuracy of the chromotropic acid, MBTH and DNPH methods for analysis of formaldehyde in a clean air matrix was confirmed and a negative bias in the MBTH method as a result of S02 interference was documented. A comparison of the concentrations of formaldehyde and aliphatic aldehydes in diluted diesel exhaust measured by the four methods indicates that significant differences exist between several of them. The concentration of formaldehyde measured by the chro- motropic acid and DNPH methods is statistically equiv- alent while aliphatic aldehyde concentrations increase (limited statistical significance) in the following order: MBTH &lt; DNPH &lt; modified MBTH.

Ullman and Charles T. Hare, South- west Research Institute, San Antonio, TX.; and Thomas M. Baines, Environmental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, MI. Emissions from two heavy-duty four stroke direct injec- tion engines designed to use methanol fuel, one using Diesel pilot fuel injection and the other using spark ignition, were characterized in this program along with those from a comparably-sized Diesel engine. Emissions evaluated during both steady-state and transient FTP procedures included regulated gases (HC, CO, and NOx), unburned methanol, aldehydes, other gaseous organics, total particulate, sulfate, soluble organics in particulate and BaP. The engines adapted for methanol fuel and using catalysts emitted less HC, CO, particulate, soluble organics, and BaP than the Diesel fueled engine. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820967. Unregulated exhaust emissions from methanol- fueled cars. Lawrence R. Smith and Charles M. Urban, Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, TX.; and Thomas M. Baines, Envi- ronmental Protection Agency, Ann Arbor, MI. This paper describes the characterization of regulated and unregulated exhaust emissions from two methanol-fueled automobiles. For comparison, two gasoline-fueled au- tomobiles of the same make and model were also evaluated. These automobiles were evaluated over the Light-Duty Federal Test Procedure and the Highway Fuel Economy Driving Schedule. Additional evaluations with the methanol-fueled automobiles were conducted using promoted base metal catalysts, and one of these auto- mobiles was tested in a non-catalyst configuration. Exhaust costituents sampled for, in addition to the regulated emissions, include: aldehydes, particulate, in- dividual hydrocarbons, methanol, ethanol, ammonia, cyanide, amines, nitrosamines, and methyl nitrite. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 820968. Alcohol fuel vehicles of Volkswagen. Holger Menrad, Gerd Decker, and Kurt Weidmann, Volkswagen Research, Wolfsburg, Germany. Based on the knowledge of previous years, different engine-vehicle designs for the use of alcohol fuels have been developed by the Research Department of the Volkswagenwerk AG in West Germany. These designs represent the basis for ethanol vehicles in Brazil and methanol vehicles in West Germany and the U.S. Different fleet test programs in West Germany, South Africa and in the State of California have been put into practice. The presented paper deals with the design, application and tests results of the German and California fleet vehicles. Priority was given to minimal fuel con- sumption by especially adjusted mixture control units. The high octane numbers of alcohol fuels allow a higher compression ratio of the engines compared to conven- tional gasoline engines. Emphasis was also laid on the emission characteristics of the German as well as of the American vehicles. As the American fleet vehicles were placed in California the emission standards for California had to be met. In this presentation test results concerning emissions, fuel consumption and power output will be shown and compared with a gasoline production car. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820970.

The system has been implemented into both cab-over-engine and conventional model vehicles. 820971. Truck climate controls: past, present and future climate controls for the truck cab. Thomas J. Johnson, Kysor of Byron, Byron, IL. Driver and passenger comfort is one of the major factors influencing truck operational safety. This paper outlines the major developments in Climate Control Systems which have been achieved over the years past, present and future. The paper includes discussion of the areas which are the most important for occupant's comfort and safety, and how these areas are controlled through the Climate Control System. Also, the systems will be reviewed for the ease of operation and the understanding of control of outputs. 130</page><page sequence="112">820972. Designing the New Mack MH COE to optimize driver environment. E. F. Saxman, Mack Trucks, Inc. The heavy duty truck industry in recent years has faced an ever greater demand for driver comfort and convenience features. This demand was met in the design of a new cab-over-engine truck cab by providing much more room within existing length and width limitations, greater adjustment to suit more drivers, "places to put things," optimum control positions, and numerous component design features for more "livability." 820973. The dynamic response of multiply-articulated truck combinations to steering input. Robert D. Ervin and Charles C. MacAdam, Highway Safety Research Institute, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Certain multiply-articulated truck combinations are known to exhibit lightly damped trailer yaw motions in response to rapid inputs of steering. This paper clarifies the yaw response phenomenon and illustrates this char- acteristic for ten vehicle combinations which are currently in use in the U.S. The phenomenon of interest is described in terms of the "amplification" in lateral acceleration level experienced at the rear-most trailer of the combination with respect to the lateral acceleration level achieved at the truck or tractor. Results from two types of comput- erized simulation are presented; one representing a linear treatment of the vehicle and producing frequency re- sponse characteristics, and the other representing a rather complete nonlinear treatment of the vehicle and produc- ing time history responses in an emergency obstacle- avoidance maneuver. The results show very large differ- ences in the tendency of various combination vehicles to amplify lateral acceleration and thus to promote pre- mature rollover of the rearmost trailing element. 820974. High capacity buses the role for the articulated bus. Christopher D. Cernes, Leyland Bus, Ley- land Vehicles Limited. Transit authorities have increasingly found that the provision of economic services to their communities require more efficient operations. Higher capacity buses have been evaluated, and as a result of trials, have entered more widespread fleet service. Articulated buses have been employed and the improvement in public transport efficiency can be assessed from a consideration of the advantages, and constraints. The relative efficiency of articulated buses and competitive high capacity buses can be assessed in a similar manner. The final choice is largely dependent on the size of the initial investment in infrastructure adaptation and the resulting whole life operating costs. 820975. In-use emissions of 1980 and 1981 passenger cars: results of EPA testing. Philip A. Lorang, John T. White, III, and David J. Brzeziński, U.S. Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. 820979 This paper presents the results of several emission testing programs conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protec- tion Agency. The test vehicles were primarily 1980 and 1981 passenger cars which were obtained at random from private owners. Some 1982 models were also tested. The 1328 vehicles were selected from the Los Angeles area as well as from a number of other low-altitude locations. The test sequence included the Federal Test Procedure, the Highway Fuel Economy Test and several short cycle tests. The primary purpose of the program was to gather information on current vehicles which could be used in calculations and projections of air quality and aid development of programs to improve it. The results of the program indicate that these vehicles are capable of maintaining low emission levels although high levels are also possible due to defects, deterioration, or tampering. Inspection/Maintenance programs are a feasible and effective means for correcting high levels when they occur. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 820977. Effects and detection of implanted defects on new technology emmission control systems. Alan D. Jones, Michael R. Appleby, and Louis J. Bintz, Automobile Club of Southern California. Various components of new technology exhaust emission control systems were disabled on five Automobile Club of Southern California fleet vehicles. Prior to and following disablement, a Federal Test Procedure and Highway Fuel Economy Test was performed on each vehicle. In addition, four short test methods were performed to determine their effectiveness in detecting the disable- ments. Results indicate the effects of the disablements on exhaust emissions, fuel economy, driveability and horse- power; and show the detection rate of the short test methods. Conclusions and recommendations are made regard- ing the effects of the disablements and the potential for preventing and/or minimizing those effects. The ability of different test methods to identify disabled emission control systems are discussed. Recommendations are made for further research with emphasis on testing of current and future emission control systems, and methods by which system failures can be identified. 820979.

Cummins NTC-475 series turbocharged engine. R. H. Robinson and J. P. Schnapp, Cummins Engine Company, Inc., Columbus, IN. High BMEP engines (approximately 250 PSI) have been investigated for a number of years in a laboratory environment. The NTC-475 has been brought to produc- tion as an automotive engine. This engine delivers a power to weight ratio of 577 lb/HP. The engine operates at levels of 209.5 PSI at rated and 251.5 PSI at torque peak (20% torque rise). The application of series boost turbochargers provides interesting boost characteristics. The independent running shafts provide a high level of flexibility to cover the engine speed range and high altitude operation. The engine has been in commercial production since April of 1981. The emphasis of this paper will be on the turbo- charging system, aftercooling, injection timing, and lengthy field test program. 820984. Cooling system requirements for advanced diesel engines. R. A. Nutt and R. F. Poehlman, Modine Manufacturing Co. Diesel engine manufacturers are currently considering designs that will result in lower combustion air tempe- ratures for improvement of fuel consumption and emis- sion levels.

Koske, Peterbilt Motors Co., Div. of PACCAR. Many materials have emerged from the aerospace and defense industries that may have a significant impact on commercial vehicles in the future. Some of these new materials were investigated for their application on Class 8 trucks. The most promising materials were applied to prototype parts and installed on a test truck as part of a lightweight development program. Most of these materials have unique characteristics that require a more complex and rigorous design process than the equivalent design with a conventional material. The major obstacles to be overcome are the high cost of the raw material and the development of automated fabrication methods. 820989. A systematic approach to lightweight truck design. John T. Sullivan, Truck Group, International Harvester Co. This paper describes the methods employed to attain very low vehicle tare weight in the development of a new line of high entry tilt cab highway tractors. Design criteria mandated no sacrifice in durability or reliability, and substantial improvements in driver space, ride, noise level and aerodynamic drag as compared to the old model. The methods used to define and organize the Engineering program are covered as well as the design and test methods employed. Specific examples are provided to illustrate the design, use of computer aided engineering such as finite element analysis and life prediction, as well as the use of accelerated testing procedures. Finally, the production vehicle is compared to the targets and to competition at introduction time where it placed lightest weight in its class. 820990. Design and fabrication of a motorcycle swingarm utilizing composite materials. Edwin M. Odom and Donald F. Adams, Composite Materials Research Group, Univ. of Wyoming, Laramie, WY. A conventional steel motorcycle swingarm was rede- signed, and fabricated utilizing fiber-reinforced composite materials, achieving a greater than 50 percent weight savings. This component is a primary structural member of a motorcycle, securing the rear wheel, and reacting all acceleration and road-induced loads. The swingarm is a stiffness-critical component. The use of composite mate- rials in this primary structural member permits a much lighter and more efficient component to be fabricated, without loss of strength or stiffness. 820991. Fiberglass reinforced foam core sandwich panel for use as refrigerated semi-trailer side walls and roofs. Allan S. Edford, Fruehauf Corp. The sandwich composite is a lightweight structural panel. The top and bottom skins are a one-piece continuous high-strength polyester fiberglass reinforced sheet. The core is a low density polyurethane foam formulated to achieve the physical and thermal properties required for insulated semi-trailer applications. The panels are unique in that when they are employed as insulated semi-trailer walls and roofs, they result in a lighter stronger and more thermally efficient vehicle. 820992. High performance turbocharging - a practical approach for amateur racing. Allen L. Osborne, Nissan Motor Corp. in USA.; and Douglas E. Johnson, Silver Eagle Mfg. Co. Addition of a turbocharger to a modified production passenger car engine increased power output enough to set a new class record at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Speed achieved in the "D/GT" class was 303 km/h (188.394 mile/h). Power developed by the 2.8L (170 in3) engine was 277 kW (372 hp estimated) at 6000 r/min. Changes to the production engine were: reduced compression ratio 132</page><page sequence="114">(6.3:1), installation of a modified camshaft, installation of a fabricated exhaust manifold and intercooler, installation of the turbocharger, and fuel system modifications to increase fuel flow. 821025.

Reduction of laboratory test data into report ready form can often be an overwhelming task in spite of the advent of modern computers. Analysis of transient type test data is most useful if accomplished at the test cell where decisions can be made and testing can continue. A processing digital oscilloscope can capture data similar to the conventional oscillograph recorder, but with the added luxury of reducing the data to whatever form is desired and producing either or both a printout or X-Y plot of the results. The processing digital oscilloscope can be as portable and as easy to set up as the oscillograph, making it a valuable R&amp;D laboratory tool. 821027. (SP-522) Simulation of torque characteristics in drivelines with universal joints. Malay K. Kar, John Deere Product Engineering Center. The variations of torque in drivelines with single and double cardan U-j oints in a 4- wheel-drive articulated farm machine in motion have been studied by computer simulation. A mass elastic model for an engine, power train and the machine is used for the simulation. The effects of tire slips and traction parameters on torque variation of drive shafts have also been included in the study. The torque in drive train input drive shaft with single U-joints having large angular unequality for 40 deg. articulation and 15 deg. oscillation about center pivot has shown severe fluctuations with reversals. The yoke accelerations are also beyond acceptable values. The power train output shaft does not show much of a torque variation because of lower speed and effective inertias and stiffnesses. The driveline torque variation is reduced when the angular unequality is made smaller. The use of double cardan joints with as high a joint angle as 32.5 deg. is 821030 found to have lowered the torque fluctuation and has eliminated the torque reversals in the drive train input shaft. The angular accelerations of yokes have also been drastically reduced. The effects of initial tire slips and coefficients of traction are found to be negligible on the torque characteristics of the drive train input shaft. The effects are larger on the torque variations of the front output shaft. The study has further shown that for the same degree of oscillation as above, a double cardan joint would be needed to reduce the torque fluctuation in the PTO input drive shaft. 821028. Performance and analysis of a dynamic loading four square machine for crawler tractor power train development. John C. Schmitt, Fiatallis North America, Inc., Engineering Laboratory. This paper describes a machine that tests crawler tractor power trains through application of the four square principle. Two units coupled to form a "closed torque loop" require only power input sufficient to overcome frictional losses. A computer governs test operation - from monitoring system parameters to control of a gearbox for dynamic torque loop loading. The loads at selected points in the closed loop were found to be dependent upon the directions of machine rotation and torque. It was concluded that frictional losses in the closed loop caused significant differences in load levels at the driving and driven test units. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821029. Torsional vibrations in a mechanical drive. George R. Doyle, Jr. and Lynn L. Faulkner, Battelle Columbus Laboratories. Torsional vibrations of an engine-powered hydraulic system were analyzed. The system consisted of: a diesel engine, spline shaft with clearance, universal joints, propeller shaft, mechanical transmission with clutch engagement, hydraulic pump, and a load. Excessive torsional vibrations resulted in propeller, spline shaft, and U-joint failures. Although the system had been adequately designed for the steady-state horsepower requirements of the pump, field failures began to occur after several systems were built and delivered. A nonlinear dynamic analysis was performed, which included variations in system parameters. The analysis revealed that two design changes would reduce the dynamic stresses. These were to increase spline clearance and to add a torsional damper to the propeller shaft. 821030. A thermoelectric heater system for military vehicles. Carmine Luciani, Dept. of National Defence, Ottawa, Canada. Military vehicles operating in northern climates require heating equipments to assist engine starting and for crew compartments. Current fuel-burning heaters obtain their electrical power from the vehicle's batteries, hence, the batteries' energy is reduced at the time the starting requirements are the greatest. A thermoelectric heater 133</page><page sequence="115">821030 system has been studied whereby heat is transferred into the coolant and electrical power required for the heater's operation is self generated. Included in this power is sufficient electric current to trickle charge the vehicle's batteries. A design and experimental data are described. 821031. Heat recovery methods for gas turbine powered ground power units. John W. Lester, Garrett Turbine Engine Co., Phoenix, AZ.; and Robert Ware, Electrical Power Laboratory, U.S. Army Mobility Equipment, Research and Develop- ment Command, Fort Belvoir, VA. For many years, gas turbine engines have been used for ground power applications where weight and space requirements dictated high specific power prime movers. Military tactical electric power has been a prime appli- cation for gas turbine engines to date. Recent escalation of fuel costs and potential degradation in quality of future fuel sources have mandated reduction in specific fuel consumption and fuel quality sensitivity for future gas turbine engine driven military equipment. This paper describes an evaluation of various heat recovery methods applied to a base line engine currently sized for a 30-kW electric output military generator set. The range of turbine inlet temperature evaluated varied from 930 to 1375°C producing from 15-kW to over 60-kW net electrical output. Heat recovery methods evaluated included current technology as well as materials and seal technology projected to be available in the 1983-1985 time frame. The results indicated that up to 50-percent fuel savings can be realized in mobile ground power gas turbine engines by the addition of heat recovery devices to existing and near-term engine developments and that an additional 5 to 10-percent saving could be realized by increasing turbine inlet temperatures. 821032. Design of an automatic draft power controller for bulldozers. Ronald L. Branstetter, Southwest Research Institute.; and Carter J. Ward, Naval Civil Engineering Laboratory. A closed-loop control system has been designed which will adjust dozer blade penetration to maximize work rate under typical dozing conditions. This paper explains the operation and requirements of such a system referred to as the Automatic Draft Power Controller (ADPC). This system is currently being developed for the Naval Construction Engineering Laboratory for use on large scale earthmoving projects. The control system described in this paper may also be applied to other types of earthmoving equipment besides bulldozers. 821033. Conceptual design and control of a large twin dozer angle blade. Carter J. Ward, Naval Civil Engineering Lab, Port Hueneme, CA. NCEL has for a number of years been experimenting with automatic and adaptive controls for construction equip- ment. Earlier progress on this work was presented in SAE papers 750765 and 770551. Included in this paper are descriptions of two technological areas believed ripe for acceptance into new developments with push bladed earthmoving equipment. These areas include blade design and utilization and blade controls. Under blade design and utilization, a large angle blade design concept is presented. The blade is powered by two side-by-side crawler tractors and controlled as a single unit by one operator. The system is designed as a retrofit kit and when fully installed, the blade angle can be changed from straight ahead to 45° right or left without requiring the operator to leave the seat. Under blade controls, auto- matic and adaptive controls that measure and adjust the cutting blade's elevation, angle, horizontal position, and thrust are presented. Some of the simplified approaches for designing practical prototype systems are discussed. 821034. (SP-525) A study of combustion chamber ar- rangements and heat release in D.I. diesel engines. Jamil I. Ghojel, FMEE, Damascus University, Syria. The experimental and analytical results from a study of a single cylinder di diesel with various combustion chamber arrangements are presented. The study investigates the properties of toroidal and cylindrical piston cavities with different fuel spray paths. It is shown that seemingly similar combustion ar- rangements behave differently. One system (optimized cylindrical) demonstrates an improved thermal efficiency and reduced sensitivity to changes in injection timing. Heat release data computed from p-0 diagram over a wide range of power, speed, and injection timing is presented. From this data, a method of calculating heat release curves for cycle synthesis is identified. The method is based on the summation of two "Wiebe" type curves. Results show good correlation between experimental and calculated cycle parameters for the systems tested. 821035. (SP-525) Convective heat transfer of an imping- ing diesel flame in a rapid compression machine. T. Kamimoto, H. Takahashi, H. Kobayashi, and S. Matsuoka, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan. The convective heat transfer of a diesel ñame impinging on a flat wall has been studied with a rapid compression machine. Heat flux at the wall as well as the temperature and movement of the flame was measured with varying the impinging distance and angle. The result shows that the local flame temperature increases in the radial direction from the stagnation point due to the progress of combustion, while the heat transfer coefficient decreases in the radial direction, and as a result the distribution of the heat flux on the impinging surface becomes almost uniform.

Technical Research Center.; and Haruhiko Kataoka, Shiro Maeda, and Chiaki Hirose, 134</page><page sequence="116">Research Laboratory of Resources Utilization, Tokyo Institute of Technology. CARS thermometry in diesel engine is reported. Spatially and time resolved spectra of N2 CARS spectrum consid- ered both temperature and pressure dependence has been developed. Temperature distribution on 20mm below the cylinder head are measured at any crank angle. N2 CARS spectra obtained do not conform to any spectra of homogeneous N2 at 1 atmosphere because of high pressure and high temperature in the cylinder. So the simulation program which takes account of pressure narrowing has been developed. Though the results of calculations and experiments are coincident with each other, it would be complicated to derive the temperature from the contour of the N2 spectrum. A careful consideration, however, shows that the line width at 1/5 height is sensitive to temperature but rather insensitive to ambient pressure. In this experiment the temperatures are determined from 1/5 band width and temperature distributions in diesel engine cylinder based on CARS are obtained. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821037. (SP-525) Catalysis of the low temperature oxidation of nitric oxide by diesel particles. Magnus Lenner, Oliver Lindqvist, and Evert Ljungström, Dept. of Inorganic Chemistry, Univ. of Gothenburg &amp; Chalmers Univ. of Technology (Göteborg/Sweden).; and Inger Lundgren and Àke Rosén, Volvo Car Corp. (Göteborg/Sweden). The ability of diesel particles to catalyze the low temperature thermal oxidation of nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide has been determined. Rate constants for the reaction in bag samples of diesel engine exhaust gases were calculated for different conditions of temperature, dilution and engine load. The reaction rate, which has a negative temperature dependence, was found to be uniformly higher in samples with diesel particles than in corresponding particle-free samples. 821039. (SP-525) Performance and emissions of ethanol and ethanol-diesel blends in direct-injected and pre-chamber diesel engines. Bill Likos, Timothy J. Callahan, and C. A. Moses, Southwest Re- search Institute. Fumigation, inline mixing, chemically stabilized emul- sions and cetane improvers were evaluated as a means of using ethanol in diesel engines. Two turbocharged six-cylinder engines of identical bore and stroke were used, differing in combustion chamber type. Three alcohol proofs were evaluated: 200, 190, and 160. Alcohol was added at the following concentrations: 10, 25, and 50% except in the case of the cetane-improved alcohol. In the latter case a commercial ignition improver for diesel fuel, DII-3, was added to neat alcohol in the proportions of 10, 15, and 20%. Generally, the emissions of CO, total hydrocarbons, 821042 and oxides of nitrogen reflected the trends observed in the thermal efficiencies. At light loads, CO and HC emissions were higher than baseline, decreasing to near baseline levels at heavy loads accompanied with higher NOx. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821040. Overland transportation of heavy-lift cargo. David Duerr, McDermott Marine Engineering - Hous- ton, Houston, TX. The land transportation of oversize, overweight cargo must be planned and executed with due consideration given to the specialized hauling equipment used and the impact of that equipment on the road surface. This paper examines the various types of hauling equipment currently in use and the engineering considerations associated with the use thereof. The methods are demonstrated by means of an example using the transportation of a 350-ton steam generator. 821041. Student design of an all-terrain vehicle for forestry operations. Awatif E. Hassan and John K. Whitfield, North Carolina State Univ. College seniors in Mechanical Engineering designed, built, and tested two self-propelled all- terrain vehicles (ATVs) adaptable as power sources in tree planting, timber cruising, recreation, and similar applications. The first ATV was constructed in 1978. Following its evaluation, modification, and re-evaluation, the second ATV was built in 1980. Field tests were conducted on prepared beds for tree planting in the Hofmann Forest in Onslow and Jones Counties, North Carolina. These tests demonstrated that the vehicles were adequately powered and capable of navigating the terrain. Modifications to improve lateral stability were recommended for future operation on tops of beds. 821042. Gear single tooth bending fatigue test. R. W. Buenneke and M. B. Slane, Caterpillar Tractor Co., East Peoria, IL.; C. R. Dunham, Zokor Corp., St. Charles, IL.; M. P. Semenek, Inter- national Harvester Co., Melrose Park, IL.; M. M. Shea, General Motors Corp., Warren, ML; and J. E. Tripp, Dana Corp., Ottawa Lake, MI. The Gear Metallurgy Committee, Division 33, of SAE Iron and Steel Technical Committee has developed a single tooth bending fatigue (STBF) technique for testing factors which could affect the fatigue life of gears. The test fixture and testing technique described in this paper were developed because of the large variations in test procedure and specimen design used throughout the industry. These variations cause difficulty in determining relative impor- tance of metallurgical factors on fatigue life of hardened gears. Four companies - Caterpillar Tractor Co., Clark Equipment Co., Dana Corp. and International Harvester Co. participated in a round robin testing program using the identically designed fixtures to show how reproducible and sensitive the technique is to metallurgical factors 135</page><page sequence="117">821042 affecting fatigue life of gears. The STBF technique produces valid and reproducible results. The Gear Metallurgy Committee will propose this technique as a Recommended Practice for the SAE Handbook. SAE Trans., Vol . 91 821043. (SP-524) Development of a modulating viscous fan drive for agricultural tractors. Steven M. Pierce, John Deere Product Engineering Center.; and Mike Shepherd, Schwitzer Cooling Systems. Attempts to improve fuel efficiency of farm tractors motivated the development and application of viscous fan drives to agricultural tractors. Early drives on tractors performed in an on-off fashion similar to drives widely used in on-highway trucks and passenger cars. Due to the high engine power and slow moving operational modes of farm equipment, a drive which continuously modulated output speed as a function of cooling requirements was desired. A design was generated and applied to agricul- tural tractors. Resulting vehicle performance improve- ments include reduced fuel consumption, reduced oper- ational noise, and reduced engine warm-up time. 821044. (SP-524) De-aeration and associate systems consideration for the engine cooling system design. Jagdish K. Patel, General Radiator Div., Chromalloy American Corp. This paper views, by means of a systems approach, the de-aeration and related aspects of the engine cooling system in order to provide the Original Equipment Manufacturer a thorough understanding of the cooling system performance. The design and testing of the de-aerating aspect of the cooling system radiator, as recommended by the engine manufacturers, are presented. 821045. (SP-521) Methods of setting tapered roller bearings. P. M. Linet, The Timken Co. Systematic tapered roller bearing setting techniques have been developed to aid the assembler in obtaining accurate and reliable bearing settings in a large variety of machines. There are numerous techniques available which allow for the setting of tapered roller bearings in very small machinery ranging through very large equipment weighing in the several ton category. SAE Trans- Vol. 91 821046. (SP-521) The influence of gear bore deflections on bearing reliability. Chris Robinson, The Torrington Co. The calculation of rolling element loads and fatigue life for a roller bearing usually assumes that the raceways are cylindrical and rigid. That is, the rolling element loads do not distort the raceways. In some cases, this is a poor assumption and results in improper bearing selection and unsatisfactory performance. This paper describes an analytical method to determine the influence of race deflections on bearing performance. The example of a bearing mounted in a gear bore is used to illustrate how these deflections can result in significant changes in bearing performance. 821047. (SP-521) The application of self-lubricated and pre-lubricated bearings to off-highway equipment Richard C. Perlberg and James H. Cooper, Jr., Garlock Bearings, Inc. The usage of self-lubricated and pre-lubricated bearings is growing in many industries. The necessary parameters for specific application of these bearing types will be examined and how each effects the bearing operating life. A method will be presented that will enable the design engineer to choose a bearing material and subsequently prescribe lubricating intervals and wear life. A review of maintenance procedures will also be outlined in compar- ison to conventional type bearings with primary concen- tration on pinned joints and other highly loaded joints.

Johnson, Michigan Tech- nological Univ. A computer simulation program was developed to simu- late the thermal responses of an on-highway, heavy duty diesel powered truck in transient operation for evaluation of cooling system performance. Mathematical models of the engine, heat exchangers, lubricating oil system, thermal control sensors (thermostat and shutterstat), auxiliary components, and the cab were formulated and calibrated to laboratory experimental data. The compo- nent models were assembled into the vehicle engine cooling system model and used to predict air-to-boil temperatures. The model has the capability to predict real time coolant, oil and cab temperatures using vehicle simulation input data over various routes. 821049. (SP-524) A computer cooling system study of a diesel powered truck for control of transient coolant, oil and cab temperatures. Vincent J. Ursini, Edward C. Chiang, and John H. John- son, Michigan Technological Univ. A Vehicle-Engine-Cooling (VEC) system computer sim- ulation model was used to study the transient performance of control devices and their temperature settings on oil, coolant and cab temperatures. The truck used in the study was an International Harvester COF-9760 cab over chassis heavy-duty vehicle equipped with a standard cab heater, a Cummins NTC-350 diesel engine with a McCord radiator and standard cooling system components and aftercooler. Input data from several portions of a Columbus to Bloomington, Indiana route were used from the Vehicle Mission Simulation (VMS) program to determine engine and vehicle operating conditions for the VEC system computer simulation model. The control devices investigated were the standard thermostat, the Kysor fan-clutch and shutter system. The effect of shutterstat location on shutter performance along with thermostat, shutter and fan activation temperature set- tings were investigated for ambient temperatures of 32, 85 and 100°F. The results show that the thermostat- 136</page><page sequence="118">shutter-fan coolant temperature control combination set at 180, 195 and 200° F respectively, resulted in the best coolant temperature control and cab comfort levels over the range of ambient temperatures. 821050. (SP-524) Inventory of heat losses for a divided- chamber diesel engine. R. M. Cole and A. C. Alkidas, Engine Research Department, General Motors Research Laboratories. A series of experiments was performed to characterize the various components of heat losses from a single-cylinder divided-chamber diesel engine. This investigation in- cluded studies (a) to determine the contribution of piston friction to the heat rejection to the coolant, (b) to measure the amount of heat rejected through the exhaust port to the coolant and (c) to evaluate the heat losses to the surroundings. The above measurements were used to evaluate the total heat losses to the combustion chamber by the working fluid during the engine cycle. These losses were then compared to the heat losses during the closed portion of the cycle (intake valve closing to exhaust valve opening) that were computed with the aid of pressure-time data.

Several cooling systems are presented which can deliver near ambient temperature turbocharged air for diesel engines. Systems are compared briefly. The effects of major operating parameters are discussed for both liquid-coupled indirect transfer systems and for the air-to-air chassis mounted cooling system. The paper emphasizes the system design process, and indicates choices which can produce minimum size or cost of heat exchangers and minimum system pressure losses for a given charge air temperature. 821052. (SP-520) Microcomputer control of steering on a small tractor (mower). Philip L. Nine, Nine, Inc.; and Hugh A. Griffin, Agile Systems, Inc. An automatically guided mower has been developed which uses microprocessor controlled hydraulics to control steering and to perform error analysis. Once initiated, the mower will follow the contrast line between high and low grass and continue until the plot of grass is mowed. The type of sensor, along with the control and error algorithms have broad applications in mobile hydraulics. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821053.

Burkhardt, Agricultural Engineering Dept., Michigan State Univ.; and B. R. Tennes, Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. 821056 Research work was done to develop an automatic steering control system for an over-the-row apple harvester which has been built by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A steering control system using noncontact sensors was designed for the apple harvester so that the harvester would automatically drive over a tree row. The sensing system consisted of several ultrasonic transducers that were used to measure the position of an apple tree trunk. This sensing system which is also called a sonar system was designed. Tests were done to determine the accuracy of the sonar measurements and the beam angle of the sonar transducer. The test results indicate that the accuracy of the sonar range measurements were affected by changes in the air temperature. Work is near comple- tion for the development of a simulation model of the control system and for performance tests of the control system. 821054.

The present trend in control systems is to extend the application possibilities of existing fluid power technology by using the intelligence, flexibility and speed that the micro-computers are offering in a constantly improving cost efficient manner. Several years ago it was pointed out that the micro-computer's role in closed loop control would involve the following areas: -Closing the loop -Pre-loop processing -Peripheral processing -Adaptive control -"Smart" redundancy -Improved time-optional control By example, this paper will show how the first three of the six above areas were involved in Extending Servo Applications. 821056. Electrohydraulic proportional valve is linked with a computer to control a three axis arm. Jack L. Johnson, Gary D. Kane, and Jay A. Sorenson, HPI/Nichols, Sturtevant, WI. A proportional electrohydraulic control valve is an ideal interface between the electronic "brains" of today's powerful microprocessors and other super chips and the muscle of the hydraulic system. In many machines, hardware constraints result in controls which are difficult for a human operator to manage and require considerable experience and skill to become proficient. The micro- processor can be used to convert the familiar X-, Y- and Z axis thinking of an operator into the complex motions of 137</page><page sequence="119">821056 the basic machine and thus produce a machine which is at the same time easy to use and predictable with minimal experience. The purpose of this paper is to relate the authors' experiences in building a three axis machine actuated by a computer controlled, proportional electrohydraulic valve. It deals with the basic machine, the hydraulic system, the electronic system and the software. 821057. Energy saving on hydraulic systems of excavators. Kazuo Uehara and Hiroyoshi Tominaga, Hy- draulic Equipment Technical Center, Komatsu Ltd. Hydraulic excavators can work on both powerful and fine jobs, which are executed safely. In conventional hydraulic systems of excavators, exhausted hydraulic energy losses were generated with fine control for attachments or with force limit. Recently, variable displacement axial piston pumps equipped with energy saving controls have been developed and made available for hydraulic excavators. With such energy saving controls which decrease mean fuel consumption of excavators, attachment drifts and noise are diminished, engine start during cold weather is made smoother and life of working fluid may be elongated. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821058. True ground speed measurement techniques. N. A. Richardson and R. L. Lanning, TRW Trans- portation Electrical and Electronics Operation.; K. A. Kopp, TRW Eagle Controls Div.; and E. J. Carnegie, California Polytechnic State Univ. This paper considers alternative methods for measuring the true ground speed of tractor vehicles as a means for controlling wheel slip to improve traction efficiency and reduce vehicle and tire wear. Test data are presented on the slip of both driven and undriven wheels for a tractor operating under various speed, load, and soil conditions. Data from a "fifth wheel" operating on smoothed and compacted soil behind a draft sled also is included. Vehicle speed determined from the speed of undriven wheels as well as vehicle speed derived from driven (slipping) wheels using a number of data processing strategies is not sufficiently accurate for either vehicle monitoring or closed loop control. The errors of single and dual beam doppler radar speed sensors caused by vehicle motion are analyzed. Single beam radar systems are shown to operate with an accuracy acceptable for operator control using signal integration times greater than approximately one second. The dual beam radar system exhibits better accuracy by eliminating the effect of quasi steady state offsets of vehicle pitch, roll, and yaw. Nevertheless, the rates of change of these angles still result in spreading the doppler return spectrum again requiring filtering or averaging to obtain an estimate of ground speed. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821059. Radar true ground speed sensor for agricultural and off road equipment. Wallace Tsuha, Arden M. McConnell, and Paul A. Witt, TRW Inc., Farmington Hills, MI. A refined method for determining true ground speed has been developed which is particularly applicable to agricultural and off-highway equipment. The radar sensor provides a conditioned output signal whose frequency is directly proportional to true ground speed. Applications include precise vehicle speed display, transmission con- trol, wheel slip control, and agricultural equipment control for planting, spraying, harvesting, etc. Advantages include increased farm productivity, maximized crop yield, re- duced fuel consumption etc. The radar sensor can interface with on-board microprocessor based equipment for controlling farm implements with greater accuracy and at higher vehicle speeds than previously possible. The radar sensor described is readily adaptable to most tractors, easy to install and service, extremely rugged, and environmentally secure. 821060. Double pump - closed center Ford tractor hydraulic system. Jim Sheppard, Senior Engi- neer, Ford Tractor Operations. The use of closed center hydraulic systems on new U.S. agricultural tractors has increased significantly in recent years. Most of these tractors use variable delivery pumps, with either constant pressure or load sensitive systems. In its new Series 10 tractors, Ford Tractor chose to develop and produce a closed center hydraulic system using fixed displacement pumps. This system is both flexible and energy conserving. It also has many of the advantages of open center hydraulic systems and can utilize some of these components. 821062. "The Producers" new row-crop tractors from John Deere. Terrill W.

Partic- ular emphasis has been directed to engines and trans- missions. And now, based on many years experience with farmers and manufacturers worldwide, several patented innovations have been developed by Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen AG into a new family of front-driven, steerable axles. This axle family provides vehicle designers with several unique features and options that optimize powertrain costs with state-of-art technology. At the same time, the end user will benefit from improved maneu- verability, improved reliability, and improved servicea- bility. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821065. (SP-523) A basic approach to gearbox noise prediction. L. D. Mitchell, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State Univ., Blacksburg, VA.; and J. W. Daws, Michelin Tire Corp., Greenville, SC. This paper provides an overview of a strategy for the prediction of noise from industrial gearboxes. A review of the history of predictive noise control in gearboxes is given. The historical lead is followed in developing the strategy, but significant changes in the approach to predictive noise control have been made. The heart of the approach is the dynamic modeling of the gearbox from inside out. Thus one must start this process with the prediction of the internal dynamic response of the gear train system. This paper then details the computational strategy for the determination of the dynamic response of the internal gearbox components. The approaches presented here are significant departures from those carried out in the past. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821066. (SP-523) Research in the gear dynamics and gear noise research laboratory.

Development of the Norton rotary motorcycle engine. D. W. Garside, Norton Motors (1978) Limited. 821076 Norton Motors have developed the mechanically-simple air-cooled-rotor-type of Wankel engine to have a higher specific output than the oil cooled rotor type. The paper traces the development over a thirteen year period and describes the present design. A characteristic of the engine is the very low mechanical friction. Mainly resulting from this factor, the specific fuel consumption is similar to the best four-stroke reciprocating engines. The potential exists for further improvements. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821069. Modifications on the intake ports with the aim to reduce the noise of a two-stroke-crankcase- scavenged engine. Klaus Groth and Norbert Kania, Institute for Piston Machines, Univ. of Hannover, Federal Republic of Germany. One of the dominant noise sources of small two- stroke-cycle and crank-case-scavenged engines (port covered and uncovered by the working piston) represents the intake noise. The opening and closing of the port of these engines which are used to drive chainsaws causes intake oscillations of big amplitudes. These are an important part of the total noise with regard to the point of measurement at the ear of the saw operator. By using a special intake port shape and the advancing of the port opening the gradient of the cross section course is reduced. The reduction of the total noise level is about 2-4 dB (A) as a function of the speed at full load while the delivery rate and the output remain constant. 821073. Study of abnormal fuel delivery characteristics in high pressure injection systems. Keizo Suzuki, Akihiro Honda, Shizuo Sumi, and Mitsugu Kibune, Nippondenso Co., Ltd., Aichi Prefec- ture, Japan. Recently, high pressure injection systems have been widely adopted to reduce black smoke, exhaust gas emission and fuel consumption and accordingly, many troubles have arisen on an engine or a vehicle. One of them is 'surging problem' on a vehicle at lower speed and load ranges. This surging problem has strong correlations with 'abnormal fuel delivery characteristics'. The purpose of this paper is to make clear the cause of these abnormal characteristics and to find out the means to avoid them. 821076.

A new integrated circuit transducer has been developed for engine oil pressure control in off-road and heavy duty vehicles. The design and development was directed at optimizing cost vs. performance trade-offs. Both, system and component level considerations have been incorpo- rated to achieve the objective. Total error of less than 2% of full scale has been accomplished with possible further improvement using system options. Of particular interest is the structural design that meets environmental relia- 139</page><page sequence="121">821076 bility and which can be extended for pressure control applications in pneumatic and hydraulic systems in off-road and heavy duty vehicles. 821077.

A new configuration was developed for track-type tractors in the 500 kW - 550 kW range to meet the market need for productive capabilities greater than those of any existing tractors. This paper identifies the design goals that were established fòr a tractor of this size; and it explains the major design features, such as modular construction and suspension for track rollers and idlers incorporated in the resultant 522 kW tractor. A review is presented of the test program that was required to assure that the configuration met the design goals. 821081. Fuel consumption of crawler tractors. C. D. Woods and J. M. Burks, Southwest Research Institute. In this paper, a mathematical model is used to determine the fuel-consuming characteristics of a typical crawler tractor with bulldozer under various operating regimes. The results are used to suggest various methods to reduce tractor fuel consumption. 821082. Diagnostic aids required to support service technicians in construction machinery dealerships. William A. Weir, U.S. Army, Training with Industry Participant, Product Support Depart- ment, Deere &amp; Co., Moline, IL. The manufacturers goal of maximizing product uptime and maintaining acceptable levels of repair costs is significantly influenced by diagnostics. Diagnostic aids such as test equipment, technical manuals, diagnostic procedures, combined with dealership service department operations, technical training and design of the manu- facturers product line directly affect a service technician's ability and capability to properly support a product. In an "ideal" diagnostic situation, results of reduced diagnostic error and repair costs, with improved product uptime and marketability are more readily achieved. The combined influence of all the factors affecting diagnostics are best considered in total, versus consideration of each factor separately. 821083. A microwave Doppler radar velocity meter for construction machinery. Akira Egawa, Komatsu Ltd. Recently, application of electronics to construction machinery has proceeded rapidly, and various measuring techniques have been required for a large number of electronic control or monitoring systems. Measurement of true velocity notwithstanding the existence of shoe or wheel slips is one of them. Microwave Doppler radar is an ideal measuring method for the purpose and has been used in automotive applications for many years. However, these vehicular radars don't provide satisfactory results in typical operating conditions of construction machinery. And there remains a lot of problems to be solved. For example, the relative error at low velocity of lkm/h or so must be reduced. In this paper, solutions of these problems based on data of the field tests, computer simulations and math- ematical analyses are described. This study led to the conclusion that the radar's performance can be highly improved. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821084. Recent development aiming at reducing wear rates of cylinder liners in grey iron. Ludovico Bruni and Guiseppe Fazzina, A.E. Borgo SPA (Italy). Wear of cylinder liners in fast diesel engines for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles and two wear test methods currently in use are considered. The cold test (engine running at 700 constant RPM, at no load with temperatures of 35° C Max. for oil, 25° C Max. for water and 30° C Max. for air) is to be preferred and to be taken as a starting point for an experimental research. The paper critically considers the current opinions on the type of cast iron and its structure which are presently regarded as the 140</page><page sequence="122">best one. To this end two groups of tests have been made to determine the influence of graphite on structure from both a qualitative viewpoint, the importance of certain metallic intercrystalline compounds and their actual contribution in terms of wear resistance. 821085. High temperature mechanical properties of SAE EV11 engine valve steel. E. Campo and S. Quaranta, Fiat Research Center.; and F. Piera- gostini, Fiat Iron &amp; Steel Division, Teksid. Mechanical properties of EV11 engine exhaust valve steel have been determined for two different heat treatment conditions, corresponding to coarse and fine grained structure with different carbide content. Testing has been performed at room temperature, 650, 750 and 850°C; the following information has been obtained: - hardness and tensile properties - creep rate dependence on stress and temperature The selection of engine valve material has been discussed on the basis of the above information type combined with existing models for fatigue phenomena. The role of metallurgical variables has been examined with particular regard to creep resistance, the first indication being that creep rate is unaffected by carbide particles. 821087. Design of time-dependent composite material structures using the quasi-elastic method. Richard D. Tonda, Texas Transportation Institute, Texas A&amp;M University. The results of a viscoelastic material characterization of SMC-50 are used to illustrate the use of the quasi-elastic design method on two simple engineering structures. The importance of accounting for material time-dependence is dramatically emphasized, as are the pitfalls and limi- tations of the quasi-elastic method. The complete linear viscoelastic theory is briefly presented and the quasi- elastic formulae are derived therefrom. A brief discussion of the various correspondence principles which allow the use of less complicated elasticity solutions and design techniques are presented. Software routines, written for the HP-41 desktop calculator, which illustrate applications of the results of a viscoelastic characterization in quasi- elastic design and analysis are included and used through- out the paper to demonstrate the ease with which this method may be used. 821088. The influence of time duration as a failure criterion in helmet evaluation. James A. New- man, Biokinetics and Associates Ltd., Ottawa, Canada. Impact performance criteria employed in the evaluation of protective headgear often consider the temporal characteristics of the translational acceleration induced in the helmeted headform during impact. These implicit criteria may appear as limits on the time during which the test headform acceleration is allowed to exceed certain values, or may be inherent in the pass/fail criterion itself. 821091 The present study examines the significance of time as a parameter in the prediction of head injury likelihood or severity. It is shown that since the temporal characteristic of the acceleration waveform is simply a reflection of the mechanical characteristics of the headform/helmet as- sembly it bears only a trivial relation to the input forcing function and thus is generally uncorrectable to head injury severity. It is concluded therefore that an upper limit on translational acceleration alone, though not without certain restrictions, constitute a sufficient criterion for evaluating helmet performance. The use of a time related parameter is shown to be unsupportable and can lead to unnecessarily complex criteria and inferior helmet per- formance. This paper was formerly presented at the AGARD AMP Specialists Meeting, Cologne, Germany, April 26-28, 1982. SAE Trans. y Vol. 91 821090. A performance prediction method for axial piston pumps of the swashplate type. W. J. Beswarick and F. S. Bhinder, School of Engineering, The Hatfield Polytechnic (Hatfield, Herts, U.K.). A system for transmitting power to the wheels of a ground vehicle must be able to meet all the possible torque and speed requirements likely to be encountered in normal use. The hydrostatic system offers a stepless transmission of power with a high response rate, and can cater for a wide range of torque and speed combinations. However, because of its low efficiency, rarely greater than 80%, the use of the hydrostatic system tends to be restricted to specialist applications. The paper describes the various loss models for the axial piston pump of the swashplate type which is used widely in modern hydrostatic systems. These models have been incorporated in a performance prediction method that could help to minimise the losses at the design stage. The predicted and measured per- formance data from a pump of modern design have been compared. The method may be applied also, with small modifications, to axial piston motors of similar design.

The Super Mileage Competition is an annual event sponsored by the Western Michigan Section of the Society of Automotive Engineers, the Eaton Corporation and the Briggs and Stratton Corporation. The purpose of this competition is to give engineering students "hands on" experience with the design and manufacture of a com- petitive vehicle and to increase public awareness of fuel efficient vehicles. This paper describes the engine modi- fications, testing procedure and results of these modifi- cations made to the super mileage vehicle entered by Michigan Technological University in the 1982 Super Mileage Competition. These modifications resulted in greater than a twenty-five percent increase in specific fuel consumption over the stock engine. With this modified 141</page><page sequence="123">821091 engine, the completed vehicle achieved over 440 miles per gallon in the final competition. 821092. Design of a formula SAE race car: vehicle dynamics and performance. Campbell Duncan Carter, University of California at Berkeley.; Cindy Barr Sherman, IBM, Austin, TX.; and Ronald Douglas Matthews, University of Texas at Austin. A design guide for vehicles is presented, including considerations of vehicle dynamics and vehicle per- formance. The various aspects of vehicle design are both qualitatively and quantitatively discussed, including pres- entation of the relevant theory, governing equations, and design options of interest for a small race car such as a Formula SAE vehicle. Relevant conclusions drawn from the theoretical analysis are presented. 821093. The 1982 National Intercollegiate Formula SAE Competition. Stephen A. Beckel, Sylvia Obregon, and Ronald Douglas Matthews, University of Texas at Austin. This paper discusses the Formula SAE Student Engi- neering Design Competition that was held May 27-29, 1982. As was the case of previous student engineering design competitions, the purpose of the Formula SAE Competition is to enchance engineering education by requiring students to apply the technical knowledge gained in their coursework to a practical engineering design problem including choice of appropriate design criteria, design, fabrication, testing, and evaluation. For the Formula SAE Competition, the design problem chosen is to design, construct, and compete a low powered Indianapolis-type race car. The purpose of this paper is to describe the 1982 Formula SAE Competition and to present the results of this event. It is expected that this paper will serve as a guide to hosts of similar competitions and will aid future Formula SAE competitors. 821094. Measurement of driveline torsional forces in four wheel drive agricultural tractors. Steve Jorissen, Steiger Tractor, Inc., Fargo, ND. The paper describes the straight forward procedure used for investigating and analyzing driveline torsional char- acteristics during development of the Steiger Panther 1000 series four wheel drive tractors. These procedures are applicable to vehicle drives designed with transmissions remote mounted from reciprocating engines and driven by a jackshaft. The final design incorporating a torsional dampener was substantiated by dynamic measurements on the actual system. 821095. How to select power-train isolators for good performance and long service life. R. Racca, Sr., Barry Controls/A Unit of Barry Wright Corp. This paper presents those factors that must be considered in selecting elastomeric isolators for power-train appli- cations in order to develop an isolation system that will be both effective and provide sufficient service life. Those factors include the dynamic modes that are the most disturbing, support structure requirements, isolator location and orientation, the advantage of decoupled modes, stability considerations, environmental factors, factors that affect fatigue life, and analysis procedure. SAE Trans,, Vol, 91 821096. Improvement of machine efficiency to increase production - the new Liehherr R 982. Dietrich Rokahr, Liebherr-America, Inc. Construction machinery, in general, has high power consumption. Most manufacturers today are working to improve the efficiency of their machines to satisfy the rising energy consciousness of their customers. Machine design changes to improve the output to input ratio should not only involve components, but also factors such as easier material penetration, better maneu- verability, easier maintenance and faster repair. Recent overall efficiency improvements in Liebherr's "2" series excavators are described, using the R 982 as an example. 821097. New insight into wire rope degradation and reliability. John H. Chen and Paul E. Gage, The Polymer Corp., Reading, PA. Wire rope degradation by bend-over-sheave cycling has been analyzed by failure modes and by progress of wire breaks to replacement criteria when using both steel and nylon sheaves. The effects of sheave ratio, design factor, rope construction and the degree and consistency of remaining strength after replacement are discussed. Critical areas of applying present rope replacement criteria suggest that impact stress at wire contacts is an important parameter to be considered. Reliability of replacement before occurrence of dangerous deterioration is discussed. Finally, measures to improve wire rope reliability are proposed. 821099. The new quality requirement. Bruce Renquist, Renquist/ Associates Inc. The New Quality Requirement is based on an industrial designer's view of value as perceived by the purchaser or user of capital equipment. An analysis of where domestic manufacturers have gone wrong and a definition of the new quality ingredients in the world market, comparing the European Ford Cargo trucks with the domestic Ford C-Series, and other pieces of capital equipment. Key product requirements include a comprehensive listing of quality factors that could be a check list for new product development. The product decisionmaking process is critiqued with a strong recommendation that the decisionmaker becomes more involved in the product. A new formula for success includes the use of market value to cost products and the view that new quality is an economic concept for survival. 821101. Fatigue in crane design. A. J. Karlsen, Det Norské Veritas. Fatigue in crane with particular reference to offshore cranes is briefly discussed, and field measurement records 142</page><page sequence="124">illustrating types of vibration experienced in crane structures are shown. Design rules against fatigue in a couple of recognized crane standards are discussed. It is pointed out that these standards might be inadequate in the evaluation of fatigue in cranes. A modified procedure for evaluation of fatigue in offshore crane elements is pointed out. The method description is provided with data which should make practical evaluations possible. The material presented is not authorized and is only to be regarded as a contri- bution to the current research in this field. 821102. (SP-522) Improvement on the fatigue strength of case hardened gears by a new heat treatment process. Kouzo Nakamura, Kenzi Mihara, Yasu- tada Kibayashi, and Takeshi Naito, Technical Research Center, Komatsu Ltd. It has been well-known that retained austenite in the surface of carburized or carbonitrided steel improves the pitting resistance of the steel under rolling contact, although some deteriorative effect on the bending fatigue has also been reported. The aim of this study is to make clear the influence of retained austenite content on the pitting and on the bending fatigue, and also to develop a heat treating process which enables quantitative control of retained austenite on the surface of gears. The gears treated by the newly developed carbonitrid- ing process to contain 60-70% retained austenite in the surface achieved a pitting life almost three times longer than those subjected to conventional carburizing without any bending fatigue failure. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821103. (SP-522) Crawler transaxle with differential lock and variable steering. Saul Herscovici, Power Engineering &amp; Mfg., Ltd. This transaxle is composed of two identical planetaries, a group of speed reducing gears that provide traction drive speed to each planetary through the sun pinions that are on a common shaft. Another group of steering, or differential lock gears provide power into the planetaries through the rotating ring gears. This transaxle is powered by two hydraulic motors, one for straight line drive, or traction drive, and the other for steering or differential lock. The output shafts are driven by the planetary carriers of the two mirror image planetaries. The speed of the output shafts is independent of load, but is dependent on the speeds of the traction and steering motors. This type of transaxle is most suitable for use on crawler track vehicles, or skid steer vehicles. It can also be used as a heavy-duty axle with differential lock option. It offers superior performance when used as a crawler drive transaxle, because its mechanical power split imparts the proper amount of required torque to each track at a steady track speed regardless of whether the vehicle travels in a straight line or in a curved line. 821107 821104. (SP-522) Design features of Komatsu's coming bulldozer D555A. Takehiko Takamatsu, Head Office, Komatsu Ltd.; and Tomoyuki Taka- hashi, Osaka Plant, Komatsu Ltd. Komatsu exhibited a prototype model of its 120T bulldozer, D555A, at the CONEXPO'81 in 1981. The D555A is capable of mass earth-moving with high productivity - a requirement that is growing rapidly, in recent years. Together with innovative features which provide for high machine availability, high durability, and, operational ease and low fatigue, the D555A is designed to be the forerunner of next generation bulldozers. At present the D555A is being field-tested, and will be placed on the market in the near future. Here we shall present the design concepts underlying the giant D555A, and the steps taken in achieving the essential design targets. 821105. (SP-522) Torque converter and hydrostatic transmissions - history and comparison. Donald B. Reinke, Consultant, Consultée. The development of the hydrodynamic and hydrostatic transmissions began within the same decade and since that time have grown to relatively widespread use. While quite different in construction they bear the common designation of a hydraulic transmission. Each transmis- sion type has its proponents who, in many cases, do not fully understand the characteristics of the other type. Considerable controversy develops which can be abated by a better understanding of operating features with respect to operating conditions. This paper is intended to assist that analysis through a side by side comparison. 821107. (SP-522) High power electric appliance for battery forklift. Shun-Ichiro Sugimoto and Shigeki Saito, Sawa Works, Hitachi, Ltd.; and Yasuyuki Sugiura and Michimasa Horiuchi, Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi, Ltd. Battery forklifts have come into general use because they can meet the requirements for using many kinds of energy to cope with the rising prices of petroleum and for improving the working environments. Along with this trend, there is a strong demand for battery forklifts which operate as fast as engine-driven ones. To realize these requirements by the conventional technology, it is inev- itable that the increased power and braking current will need a larger traction motor and the temperature rise caused by commutator sparks induced by plugging will also need a larger traction motor. In order to reduce the size and weight of the traction motor by reducing the temperature rise, we have developed a high-power traction motor with a built-in fan motor which turns independ- ently of the rotation of the motor, and we have also developed a controller with regenerative braking which charges a part of braking energy into the battery, reducing the temperature rise of the motor. By combining the two devices, it was possible to attain as good driving performance as engine-driven forklifts and to lengthen the operating time by 10% in the operation mode in which starting and stopping with regenerative braking were 143</page><page sequence="125">821107 repeated. 821108. Laser marking and serializing. Peter M. Baker, Quantrad Corp. Laser marking has been used for some years now, particularly in the electronics industry where this was a natural outgrowth of laser resistor trimming. Within the electronics business, there are a growing number of applications including the case of silicon wafer identification and in the general industrial world, laser marking has proved to be a cost effective competitor to stamping, chemical etching and other alternate tech- niques. The principles of operation are discussed including selection of laser and optical systems. Some system features are discussed in more detail including the interaction between the laser beam and the material. Reading systems are reviewed and system consid- erations necessary for automated products are discussed. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821109. The laser: new concepts in manufacturing. Mark W. Baldwin and Arvid G. Waschek, Iowa Laser Technology, Inc. A number of modern manufacturing concepts have recently been introduced to industry; among them are: the laser beam, the electron beam, electric discharge machining (EDM) and electro-chemical machining (ECM). Each has its distinctive characteristics and advantages. The laser beam has very high productive capability and has great versatility with regard to the manufacturing operations it can perform and the mate- rials which it can process. 821111. Designing to improve serviceability - earthmoving and construction machinery. M. Rudolph Lenich, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The ease of serviceability affects the total owning and operating cost of earthmoving and construction machin- ery. Equipment is purchased to do a job and do it effectively. Serviceability impacts on product effective- ness. In addition to ease of repair (repairability) and ease of maintenance (maintainability), serviceability includes ease of diagnosis. During machine development phases, serviceability must be developed along with other machine requirements. To produce desirable results, a planned, disciplined process with dealer and user input added to manufacturer's input is required. 821112. Environmental effects of off-highway recreational motorcycles. Robin T. Harrison, Forest Service, USDA.; and W. A. Murphy, Tony Murphy, Inc. A Task Force of the SAE Motorcycle Committee was chartered to develop a method of classifying environ- mental impact potentials of off-highway motorcycles. The Task Force concentrated on the potential of the machines - even though environmental impact is also strongly affected by the operator, the type of resource, and the conditions under which these interface. The Task Force concluded that off-highway motorcycles can be classified according to their acoustic impact, using easily performed SAE stationary tests. While classifying off-highway motorcycles according to their surface impact potential appears possible, non-machine factors (such as rider attitude and skill, terrain, soil, etc.) are far more important than the machines themselves in assessing any actual surface impact. Other than sound and ground, environ- mental impact potentials from off-highway motorcycling are very minor. 821113. (SP-525) A method to improve the solubility and combustion characteristics of alcohol-diesel fuel blends. Tadashi Murayama, Noboru Miyamoto, Takanobu Yamada, and Jun-ichi Kawashima, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Hokkaido Univ.; and Koichiro Itow, Komatsu Ltd. This paper reports the results of two parallel investi- gations: An investigation on the solubility of alcohols in diesel fuels, and the diesel engine performance with the blended fuels. The investigation proposes an empirical formula for the solubility of alcohols in diesel fuels, as a function of temperature, water content, additive concentration and specific gravity of the diesel fuel. The engine performance when using the blended fuels was also investigated. Compared with conventional diesel fuels, the blended fuels show promise of better thermal efficiency, smoke free operation, and reduction of HC, NOx, and CO emissions. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821114. (SP-525) A new accumulator fuel injection system for direct injection diesel engines. J. Akagi, T. Edo, T. Sakasai, and Y. Tsumura, Engine Technical Center, Komatsu Ltd. The development of a new accumulator-type fuel injection system for direct injection diesel engines is described. Some revised injectors have been developed giving consistent fuel delivery. Both single and multi-cylinder engines have been run and the results reveal the excellent capabilities of a new accumulator fuel injection system with an improvement in fuel economy and black smoke especially at medium or low engine speeds. This system can be installed easily on current diesel engines with little or no modification. SAE Trans- Vol. 91 821116. (SP-523) The use of sound intensity techniques for obtaining sound power ratings of hydraulic pumps. George A. Clark and Russell F. Ruhnow, International Harvester Co. Sound power measurements have been widely used as a means of classifying component noise of off-highway equipment. Traditional sound power measurements are accurate and repeatable but require specially designed acoustical rooms. These measurements require removal of the component from the vehicle and a means of powering, loading and monitoring the component. Sound intensity measurements have been proven as a 144</page><page sequence="126">valuable tool in the calculation of sound power. Meas- urements can be made directly on the vehicle, thus eliminating the need of external power supplies and loading devices. The sound intensity technique is quick, dependable and does not require the use of special acoustical rooms. This paper discusses an example of sound intensity for measurement of hydraulic pump noise. These measure- ments have been verified using conventional sound power measurements on the same pump. 821119. (SP-523) Considerations for hydrostatic system noise control. J. W. Bolinger, Sundstrand Hydro-Transmission. To control hydrostatic system noise requires knowledge of its characteristics relative to design and operating param- eters. Pump and motor noise have been characterized for normal operating ranges of axial-piston, mobile appli- cations. Using this data, combined with characteristics of other components, system design and operating param- eters can be chosen so that the total response function minimizes the noise potential of each component. 821120. Estimation of the light durability of automotive interior materials with the value of equivalent total sunshine energy. Yukio Watanabe, Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. À method of making light durability estimation of automotive interior materials has been investigated, and the Equivalent Total Sunshine Energy (ESE) is obtained to combine the detrimental factors during outdoor use, e.g., light intensity, exposure period, and thermal condi- tions. Outdoor exposure tests and measurement of ESE are carried out with the same materials using many different exposure conditions, for example, three exposure sites, three exposure periods and four seasons. All observed deterioration characteristics caused by the outdoor ex- posure tests show excellent correlation with the ESE value. 821123. A new method for ascertaining the strength of metals. Joseph Stanovsky, Department of Aer- ospace Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington. This paper describes a strain-limit strength theory; the strength of a material is established from the normal strain equations by considering: (1) the principal strains deter- mine the strength of a material, (2) that the intermediate normal strain equations are defined by the relative magnitudes of the principal strains, and (3) that the strength of a metal coincides with the occurrence of a maximum permissible strain. The process is demonstrated for plane stresses that cause an arbitrary condition of strain. From these equations, two yield criteria are derived by introducing Hooke's law and by using the onset of plastic flow as the limit strain event. The equations produced are similar to the von Mises and Tresca yield conditions. 821150 821148. (SP-530) Influence of crankcase lubricant vis- cosity on fuel consumption in a medium-speed diesel engine. J. C. Wall, Chevron Research Co. The influence of crankcase lubricant viscosity on brake specific fuel consumption (bsfc) has been evaluated in two medium-speed automotive diesel engines. An experimen- tal procedure was established using steady-state operating conditions chosen to increase sensitivity of fuel con- sumption to changes in lubricant viscosity. The exper- imental procedure was used to evaluate Newtonian and non-Newtonian lubricants. Results show that, as a group, 15W-40 multigrades are slightly better in fuel economy than a SAE 30 single grade. This difference is attributed to temporary viscosity loss with the multigrades. Use of high shear stress viscosity data brings fuel consumption data with non-Newtonian lubricants into line with that of Newtonian lubricants with the same viscosity and accounts for the difference in fuel consumption observed between two multigrades blended with different molecular weight polymers of the same molecular type. A well known friction reducer shows no effect on bsfc. This confirms the predominance of viscosity in deter- mining fuel economy in this engine. 821149. (SP-530) The effects of turbocharger design and installation on gasoline vehicle transient response. David Elpern, The Garrett Automotive Products Co., Los Angeles, CA. A series of tests were run on a turbocharged gasoline powered vehicle to determine means of improving vehicle transient response through turbocharger design and installation modifications. Turbine inlet temperature, turbocharger rotating inertia, turbine housing flow char- acteristics, and turbine outlet pipe restrictions were found to have the most important effects on vehicle response. Turbine inlet pipe length and crossectional area had a large effect on turbine inlet temperature but had no significant effects on response if turbine inlet temperature was held constant. 821150. (P-l 13) Critical issues in finite element modeling of head impact. Tawfik B. Khalil and David C. Viano, Biomedical Science Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories, Warren, MI. Current finite element models of head impact involve a geometrically simplified fluid-filled shell composed of homogeneous, linear and (visco)elastic materials as the primary surrogate of the human skull and brain. The numerical procedure, which solves the mechanical re- sponse to impact, requires and presumes continuity of stress and displacement between elements, a defined boundary condition simulating the neck attachment and a known forcing function. Our critical review of the models discussed, primarily, the technical aspects of the approximations made to simulate the head and the limitations of the proposed analytical tools in predicting the response of biological 145</page><page sequence="127">821150 tissue. The following critical features were identified as major factors which compromised the accuracy and objectivity of the models: - The brain was approximated by a fluid contained in an elastic or rigid shell with no provision for relative motion between the shell and fluid. The approximation is inadequate in view of clinical and experimental evidence asserting that brain injury may be strongly influenced or caused by skull deformation and relative brain motion. - The computed shell strains were greater by as much as a factor of ten in a numerical comparison with experimental data. Moreover, the fluid pressure was dissimilar in phase and amplitude, with peak pressures representing about 25% of the experimental value. - The model objectivity was compromised by using different fluid compressibilities which varied by a factor of 200 to match experimental data. No scientific justi- fication could be found for the wide variation in fluid property. - The first three resonant frequencies were about one-tenth of the values reported for the human head. The dynamic dissimilarity was probably due to an insufficient number of elements in the model and produced an incorrect impact response. - The acceleration input was not sufficiently repre- sentative of a typical head impact. Similarly, the boundary condition representing the neck attachment was either excluded or unrealistically simulated in spite of its strong influence on the response. - The proposed brain tolerance criteria, based on fluid pressures, indicated potential errors in space and time increments of the finite element solution.. Although significant progress has been made in the development and refinement of finite element models of head impact, the available computer programs represent mechanical simulations which are inadequate to establish tolerance criteria or predict head injury. In fact, the models are only a qualitative simulation of a simplified head surrogate, and as such, constitute merely the first approximation of one aspect of a highly complex biolog- ical problem. 821153. (P-113) Pathophysiology of cervical injuries. A. Sanees, Jr., J. Myklebust, D. Kostreva, J. F. Cusick, R. Weber, C. Houterman, S. J. Larson, D. Maiman, P. Walsh, and M. Chilbert, Dept. of Neurosurgery, The Medical College of Wiscon- sin, Marquette Univ. and V.A. Medical Center, Milwaukee, WI.; F. Unterharnscheidt, C. Ewing, and D. Thomas, Naval Biodynamics Lab, New Orleans, LA.; K. Siegesmund, Dept. of Anatomy, The Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI.; K. Ho, Dept. of Pathology, The Medical College of Wisconsin, Wilwaukee, WI.; and B. Saltzberg, Texas Research Institute of Mental Sciences, Houston, TX. Male Macaca mulatta monkeys were studied with slow application of axial forces to the vertebral column with forces which produced an approximate 50% reduction in the afferent or efferent evoked potential amplitude. Autoradiographic studies with 14C deoxyglucose demon- strated a marked reduction in metabolic activity at the cervical-medullary junction and cervical spinal column while other levels of the spinal column were essentially normal. Examination of the neural tissue with light microscopy was unremarkable. However, in a 7-day survival monkey, damage was observed in the central gray nervous tissue at the cervical level. Electron microscopy studies with similar force application demonstrated shrinkage of the axoplasm and disruption of the myelin lamellae in the upper and lower cervical regions while brain and thoracic spinal cord tissues were minimally altered. These preliminary findings suggest that the greatest effects occur in the cervical regions with axial distension and that 14C deoxyglucose and electron mi- croscopy may be valuable for the evaluation of early physiologic alterations following biomechanical trauma to the brain and spinal column. 821154. (P-113) Finite element models of the head and their use in brain injury research. Carley C. Ward, Biodynamics/Engineering, Inc., Pacific Palisades, CA. This paper discusses the status of head injury models, their applications and limitations. Although finite element models have replaced all earlier continuum models in the analysis of head impact, there remain misconceptions regarding their use and accuracy. The paper addresses these misunderstandings and responds to recent model critiques. Trade-offs between cost and accuracy are explained. Brain model design criteria are defined and material property selection explained. The following subjects are discussed using model data: brain motion, brain stem strains, concussion, brain contusion, and cervical cord- brain interaction. 821155. (P-113) Injuries to the cervical spine caused by a distributed frontal load to the chest. R. Cheng, K. H. Yang, R. S. Levine, and A. I. King, Wayne State Univ., Detroit, ML; and R. Morgan, NHTSA, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC. Unembalmed cadavers were exposed to -Gx acceleration while restrained by applying a frontal load to the chest. A pre-deployed non-venting production air cushion mount- ed on a non-collapsible horizontal steering column provided the distributed load. The sled deceleration pulse was determined from a series of Part 572 dummy runs in which the HIC, chest acceleration and knee loads were at but not in excess of the limits specified in the current FMVSS 208. A total of six cadavers have been tested. In three of the runs, there were severe neck injuries of the type which have not been observed previously in bęlted tests. They include complete severance of the cord, complete avulsion of the odontoid process, atlanto-occipital separation with 146</page><page sequence="128">ring fracture. This study does not claim to establish the injury potential of air bags but uses the air bag to provide a uniform restraining load to the chest to investigate the mechanism of neck injuries. High neck loads were encountered in this mode of impact in which the head and neck kinematics were different from those of belted cadaveric subjects. Cadaveric and dummy neck loads were also different. The proposed neck fracture load is 6.2 kN (1,400 lb). This is the resultant neck load. 821157. (P- 113) Proposal for a thorax tolerance level in side impacts based on 62 tests performed with cadavers having known bone condition. J. Sacreste, F. Brun-Cassan, A. Fayon, and C. Tarrière, Laboratoire de Physiologie et de Bio- mécanique, Peugeot S.A./Renault.; and C. Got and A. Patel, Institut de Recherches Biomé- caniques et Accidentologiques, Hôpital Ray- mond Poincaré. A large number of experiments involving cadavers - including real-world-accident reconstructions - have been performed for the purpose of enhancing the state of knowledge concerning tolerance levels and protection criteria relevant to side-impact conditions. However, the scatter of the findings, as well as the considerable differences in injury severity levels (differences that cannot be accounted for by age differences alone) have limited the conclusions that it was possible to draw from these investigations in terms of criteria, mainly concerning thoracic protection. The major cause of scatter is the considerable differences in skeleton quality between subjects. Analysis of the rib characterization test findings made it possible to define a thoracic resistance index enabling the estab- lishment of a classification of subjects. This index, which was validated with our sample, allowed us to evaluate the pertinence of the various side-impact protection criteria considered. When this index is used, thoracic deflection, in particular, emerges as a satisfactory criterion for predicting the risk of occurrence of rib fractures in side-impact collisions. The transposition of this criterion to dummies is consequently made possible, and is discussed. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821158. (P- 113) Submarining injuries of 3 pt. belted occupants in frontal collisions - description, mechanisms and protection. Y. C. Leung, C. Tarrière, and D. Lestrelin, Laboratory of Phys- iology and Biomechanics, Peugeot-Renault As- sociation (France).; C. Got, F. Guillon, and A. Patel, I.R.B.A. Raymond Poincaré Hospital, Garches, France.; and J. Hureau, Faculty of Medicine, University of Paris, France. Accidentological studies show, firstly, what kind of injuries are sustained by seatbelt wearers in frontal collisions, to abdomen, lumbar spine and lower members and, secondly, how to determine their frequencies and severities. Corresponding data are presented. 821160 Then, a synthesis is made, in which the results of extensive cadaver testing - more than 300 human subjects - are examined with particular emphasis on the abdom- inal injuries, and on the association of injuries, such as lumbar spine injuries. Causation is particularly looked at. This experimental survey is completed by the results of specialized testing in abdominal tolerance when sub- marining occurs. These two surveys enable the development of protec- tion. Finally, former attempts for defining an abdominal protection criterion are reviewed and a final definition for such a criterion is presented and justified. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821159. (P-l 13) Pelvic tolerance and protection criteria in side impact. Dominique Cesari and Michelle Ramet, Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécan- ique, ONSER, Bron-France. The protection of car occupants against side impact accidents needs a better knowledge of injury mechanisms and of tolerance which are necessary to propose protec- tion criteria. The results of the study reported in this paper give the values of pelvic fracture impact force and indicate the variation of this parameter in relation to the anthro- pometric parameters. The injuries produced by these tests were compared to pelvic injuries sustained in side impact real accidents; static tests made with half a pelvis have shown that the pubic rami were the deformed part of the pelvis. According to these findings, we have tried to correlate the impact force values and the values of a parameter linked with the bending process. This relationship have been found very well correlated. These results allow to propose a pelvic human tolerance parameter from which a protection criterion for pelvis in side „ impact could tíe derivated. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821160. (P-l 13) Impact response and injury of the pelvis. Guy S. Nusholtz, Nabih M. Alem, and John W. Melvin, University of Michigan, Highway Safety Research Institute. Multiple axial knee impacts and/or a single lateral pelvis impact were performed on a total of 19 cadavers. The impacting surface was padded with various materials to produce different force-time and load distribution char- acteristics. Impact load and skeletal acceleration data are presented as functions of both time and frequency in the form of mechanical impedance. Injury descriptions based on gross autopsy are given. The kinematic response of the pelvis during and after impact is presented to indicate the similarities and differences in response of the pelvis for various load levels. While the impact response data cannot prescribe a specific tolerance level for the pelvis, they do indicate variables which must be considered and some potential problems in 147</page><page sequence="129">821160 developing an accurate injury criterion.

Edward Red, Keith Hale, Make McDermott, and Ben Mooring, Texas A&amp;M Univ., Me- chanical Engineering Dept. Applications of modern technology make it possible for handicapped people confined to wheelchairs to travel in vehicles in both driver and passenger modes. This is consistent with the trend of increased independence and mobility for the handicapped confined to wheelchairs. Concurrent with this trend is the development of wheelchair restraint devices/systems to restrain the wheelchair and provide the wheelchair occupant some measure of protection in normal and abnormal (crash) driving situations. The proliferations of these devices, some of which afford minimal restraint to the wheelchair occupant, led representatives of the Texas Transportation Institute and the Mechanical Engineering Division of the Texas Engineering Experiment Station (TEES), with the funded support of the Veterans Administration (VA), to conduct a program to test and evaluate representative restraint devices currently being marketed. This paper describes the progress that has been made in this program to-date. Included are the descriptions of the test facility, photographs of some of the actual impact tests and the description of a new restraint system that is under development. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821162. (P-113) Effectiveness of protective clothing in Munich area motorcycle accidents. Erich Schuller, Gundolf Beier, and Wolfgang Spann, Institut für Rechtsmedizin der Universität Mün- chen, Munich, Germany. To assess the effectiveness of protective clothing, in particular of crash helmets, a nine-month accident field study was carried out, which covered non-minor injured helmeted and unhelmeted motorcyclists. Crash Helmets were found to reduce the number of non-minor injured riders at least 82% of the figure for unhelmeted riders. Depending on the motorcycle class, the type and locality of the accident, the risk abatement varies from 82% to 94%. The average head injury risk abatement for helmeted riders of standard motorcycles is about 94% when moderate and more severe head injuries are included, and 97% for severe, serious and fatal head injuries. With respect to accidents in which unhelmeted riders suffer non-minor injuries, crash helmets reduce the risk of suffering skull fractures, fractures and dislocations of the atlanto-occipital joint and cervical vertebrae by 97% to 98%, moderate cranial brain injuries by 84%, and more severe cranial brain injuries by 97%. Wearing motorcycle clothing is effective in preventing or reducing abrasions and lacerations at low levels of injury severity. For these kind of injuries a risk abatement of at least 43% was found. 821163. (P-113) Transportation of children in cars -evaluation of restraint use in France. Mary- vonne DeJeammes and Roger Biard, O.N.S.E.R. Laboratoire des Chocs et de Biomécanique.; and Jean René Carre and Brigitte Cambon de Lavalette, O.N.S.E.R. Laboratoire de Psycho- logie de la Conduite. In France, the improvement of the child protection in cars has been one main concern since 1975. It sets a quite specific problem dealing with physical and psychological factors. This paper will give an overview of the actual situation. The accident statistics and investigations recall the benefits of the back seat travel for the children under ten years old. Moreover two surveys aiming at describing the real conditions in which the child is travelling in the car and the restraint system is used, are analysed. They indicate the very low use rate of child restraints especially for eldest as well as the parents appreciations on these child restraints. These elements are discussed in order to propose future efforts which contribute to the improvement of the child occupant's safety. 821164. (P-113) Safety considerations for electric and hybrid vehicles. Paul J. Brown, U.S. Department of Energy.; and Richard T. Hall, The Aerospace Corp. Safety considerations have been included in the devel- opment of the technology for electric and hybrid (heat engine plus electrical propulsion) vehicles. Although a number of safety requirements for conventional vehicles are eliminated with this new technology, there are safety issues that are unique and require special safety design considerations. This paper describes the development of the safety requirements of electrical propulsion vehicles including the design, test, and evaluation results of impact testing. The safety design and testing results of battery com- partments and containment, flywheels, and vehicle com- posite structures and hybrid technology are described for three different test vehicles - ETV-1, ETV-2, and HTV-1. The unique safety requirements of electric vehicles such as electrical shock, battery-related safety, and operation safety are described. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821165. (P-113) Unrestrained, front seat, child surrogate trajectories produced by hard braking. R. L. Stalnaker, L. F. Klusmeyer, H. H. Peel, and C. D. White, Southwest Research Institute.; and G. R. Smith and H. J. Mertz, General Motors Corp. This paper describes a study to determine the influence of preimpact vehicle braking on the positions and postures of unrestrained, children in the front seat at the time of collision. 148</page><page sequence="130">Anesthetized baboons were used as child surrogates. The unrestrained animals were placed in various initial sitting, kneeling, and standing positions typically assumed by children while traveling in automobiles. Tests were conducted with various front seat positions and seat covering materials. Measurements were made of pertinent vehicle dynamics and surrogate kinematics during the hard braking event. For each initial condition evaluated, a photosequence is given showing typical positions and postures of the surrogate during the braking event. The principal conclusion of the study is that the kinematic response of a child will be somewhere between that of a child dummy (probably more representative of a "braced" child) and that of an anesthetized baboon (probably more representative of a sleeping or relaxed child). The anesthetized animal pivoted about his hips and tumbled forward in response to the braking, whereas the child dummy maintained his seat position while sliding forward. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821166. (P-113) Predictions of child motion during panic braking and impact. Ints Kaleps, Air Force Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory.; and Jeffrey H. Marcus, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. To study child motion during vehicle deceleration, 167 simulations were conducted using a large three-dimen- sional gross body motion model program in which seven initial body positions, 2.5-, 3- and 6-year-old body sizes, three levels of panic braking deceleration, cases of superimposed crash decelerations and several seat sliding friction coefficients were considered. Predicted head impact times and velocities of impact are given and three-dimensional motion graphics presented for a num- ber of the simulations which illustrate body and vehicle interaction and gross three-dimensional body motion. Also included are comprehensive data sets for body dimensions, inertial properties and initial three-dimen- sional position descriptions. 821167. (P-113) Interaction of car passengers in frontal, side and rear collisions. Eberhard Faerber, Traffic Safety and Accident Research, Depart- ment of the Federal Highway Research Institute (BASt), Cologne. The aim of this study is systematically to evaluate and quantify the influence of interaction of car passengers in impacts. Within this programme 70 car tests were performed. The impact speeds were 30 and 60 km/h for the frontal and rear and 30 and 45 km/h for the lateral impacts. Impact angles were as follows: frontal: 0° and 30° left; lateral: 60Oiand 120° left, 90° right; rear: 180° and 150° left. Test cars were of subcompact type bought on the car market. Impacting vehicle was a rigid moving barrier according to SAE J 972a. Each of the 14 configurations was repeated 5 times. The effects of interaction were studied on 50 percent male PART 572 dummies. 821170 The significant effect of interaction is the change of direction of acceleration in the additionally loaded occupant, because the interaction forces are effective in the opposite direction of the primary impact forces. If interaction happens after the primary impact pulse is finished, high peak-to-peak acceleration levels with a considerable extension of acceleration pulse duration are the consequence. At the higher impact velocities, protec- tion criteria of both dummies were very often exceeded. In oblique impact directions, occupant kinematics and interaction effects were much more complicated. 821169. (P-113) Accuracy and sensitivity of CRASH. Russell A. Smith and J. Thomas Noga, U.S. Department of Transportation, National High- way Traffic Safety Administration. The accuracy and sensitivity of the CRASH computer program are examined. Accuracy is related to how well CRASH performs in comparison to results from 53 vehicles in 27 independent staged collisions. Sensitivity is related to how estimated field errors or imprecision affect the precision of computed delta-V. The sensitivity to error in the coefficients of the force-deflection relationship is examined. With regard to accuracy, CRASH tends to under- estimate delta-V at low values of delta-V. CRASH tends to be unbiased at high values of delta-V; however, the number of tests at high delta-V is small. Typical errors estimated by available independent data indicate that the 95 percent confidence limits on individual calculations of delta-V range from 9 to 25 percent. Errors of 10 percent in the force-deflection coefficients were observed to result in errors of 2 to 6 percent in delta-V calculations. 821170. (P-l 13) Comparison between frontal impact tests with cadavers and dummies in a simulated true car restrained environment. Dimitrios Kallieris, Hugo Mellander, Georg Schmidt, Jürgen Barz, and Rainer Mattern, University of Heidelberg. A test series of 12 fresh cadavers and 5 Part 572 dummies is reported. The test configuration is frontal impact sled simulation at 30 mph and aims to simulate the restraint environment of a Volvo 240 car. The test occupants are restrained in a 3-point safety belt. The instrumentation of the surrogates involves mainly 12-accelerometers in chest, 9-accelerometers in head and 3-accelerometers in pelvis. Measured values are given and discussed together with the medical findings from the cadaver tests. The occurrence of submarining with cadavers and dummies is reported. A comparison is also made with earlier work where both field accidents and sled simulations of similar violence have been reported. It is concluded that there exist differences in kinematics between the dummy and the cadaver, although peak chest acceleration is similar in both conditions. The lap belt slides over the iliac crest more frequently in the cadaver tests than in the dummy tests. However, no abdominal injuries were found. The pattern of the observed injuries on the cadavers are similar 149</page><page sequence="131">821170 to what has been earlier reported, although the severity is higher than in comparable field accidents. 821180. Newtonian multigrade gear lubricants: formula- tion and performance testing. R. F. Watts and G. L. Willette, Uniroyal, Inc. The use of high molecular weight polyalphaolefins makes possible the preparation of Newtonian multigraded lubricants. The preparation of a family of multigrade automotive gear oils, including a unique 75 W- 140 grade, is presented along with GL-5 performance testing and fuel economy demonstration under controlled conditions. 821181. Axle efficiency - response to synthetic lubricant components. B. M. O'Connor, L. F. Schiemann, and R. L. Johnson, The Lubrizol Corp. This paper deals with the performance of both semisyn- thetic and full synthetic automotive gear lubricants in laboratory axle efficiency tests. The development and use of laboratory models for the purpose of predicting lubricant related fuel economy benefits in actual field service is explained. Using these laboratory techniques, improvements in axle efficiency provided by selected synthetic based lubricant formulations are demonstrated. 821182. Evaluation of gear lubricant antiscore properties. William F. Olszewski, James W. Frampton, and D. J. Taylor, Mobil Research and Development Corp.; and James M. Stanek, Mobil Chemical Co. The CRC L-42 axle test is used to evaluate the score protection of automotive gear lubricants under conditions of high speed and shock loading. A modification of the CRC L-42 test procedure to increase severity and a screening test to predict axle performance are discussed. CRC L-42 severity level is increased by using higher speeds and dynamometer loadings during the shock cycles. Under these more severe test conditions, both RGO-110 passing reference oil and API GL-5 quality level lubricants blended from commercially available additive packages gave unacceptable coast side scoring. Scoring could be reduced to satisfactory levels by the addition of appropriate extreme pressure agents to these lubricants. This modified CRC L-42 test procedure serves as a useful tool for evaluating the performance reserve of automotive gear oils. A screening procedure using the SAE Load Test has been developed which shows good correlation with both the standard and modified CRC L-42 tests. This bench test is both a simple and rapid tool for evaluating experimental gear lubricants for their antiscore properties. 821183. Scoring load capacity of EP-oils in the FZG L-42 test. Hans Winter and Klaus Michaelis, FZG, Technical University Munich. The scoring load capacity of hypoid gear oils is evaluated in the CRC L-42 test or the VSS- test in hypoid gear sets. The methods use complicated expensive test rigs and either commercially manufactured gears of mass produc- tion quality or high cost ground gears. The test results depend very much on test parameters which can hardly be controlled as e.g. height of shock loading or bearing pattern of test gears in the test gear box. At the FZG laboratory a test method was developed using case carburized and ground spur gears in a four square spur gear rig. After a 20 min run-in the gears run for 6 min at the expected test torque at 3000 rpm and an oil sump temperature of 110°C. After the test the damaged area on the flanks is evaluated. The results allow for the classification of the tested oil relatively to the RGO oils up to a level of RGO 115. A calculation method of scoring load capacity of hypoid gears was developed using the test result as a limiting value. 821184. Gear oil developments beyond GL-5. P. S. Korosec, S. Norman, and R. E. Kuhlman, Edwin Cooper Division, Ethyl Corporation. This paper examines developments/trends beyond the requirements of the API GL-5 category for automotive gear oils. One key development appears to be the establishment of fuel-saving benefits through proper lubricant viscosity and use of friction modifiers. Another development is the trend toward improved durability of the power train from axle to transmission. It is concluded that fuel economy benefits are practical through proper lubricant choice and that GL-5 oils do not necessarily provide improved durability. 821185. (SP-527) Performance evaluation of 10% etha- nol-gasoline blends in 1980 model year U.S. cars. L. S. Bernstein, Exxon Research &amp; Engineering Co.; N. D. Brinkman, General Motors Research Laboratory.; and R. R. Carlson, Systems Con- trol, Inc. The Coordinating Research Council, Inc. (CRC), under contract to the U.S. Department of Energy, conducted controlled tests to determine the effects of 10% ethanol- gasoline blends on emissions, fuel economy, and drive- ability of 14 - 1980 model year cars representing several emission-control technologies. Two types of ethanol blends were tested, a simple blend with no volatility adjustment, and two volatility-adjusted blends. Addition of 10% ethanol to gasoline resulted in statistically significant changes in emissions, driveability, and effi- ciency. Statistically significant effects were also found as a result of volatility adjustment. However, because of the limited fleet size, these results should not be used to quantitatively predict effects of the use of ethanol-gasoline blends in the total U.S. vehicle population. 821186. (SP-527) Wear studies on an automotive gasoline engine using methanol gasoline blends - a study of the effects of variables. P. C. Nautiyal and Mahi Pal, Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehra Dun, India.; and V. A. Zvonow, Machine Building Research Institute, Voroshilovgrad, U.S.S.R. This paper presents wear results of the top piston ring for an automotive spark ignited engine using gasoline and 150</page><page sequence="132">methanol blends. The Radiotracer Technique was em- ployed utilising the multichannel analyser. In order to assess the wear process resulting due to each single factor viz. fuel type, engine speed, bhp and the water jacket temperature, investigations were carried out based on a series of statistically designed experiments. The design matrix employed a one half replication of 24 set. The study showed that the speed and load of an engine markedly affect the top ring wear. Use of alcohol blended fuels was found to marginally increase wear especially at low operating temperatures. 821187. (SP-527) Phase separation control system for gasoline-methanol blends in passenger cars. W. A. Goetz, Ontario Research Foundation, Mis- sissauga, Ontario, Canada. Gasoline-methanol blends, without stabilizing additives, phase separate at low temperatures and/or in the presence of water. This has been, among others, a restrictive factor for the utilization of gasoline-methanol blends in the single tank of a passenger car equipped with an S.I. engine, especially in areas of seasonable low temperature conditions like in Canada. A phase separation control system (PSC) has been developed which can be retrofitted to an engine equipped with an oxygen sensor controlled closed loop carburettor. Blends up of M25 have been utilized while maintaining the flexibility to operate the engine on straight gasoline. Both fuels are carried in one tank and the PSC delivers to the engine after start up and warm up a proportional and stable blend, while during cold start and at phase separated conditions, straight gasoline (gasoline rich phase) is utilized. Data of cold starts on different methanol blends (M5 to M30) as performed on a dynamometer are presented indicating the warm up operation and the system limits. The PSC system has been installed in a vehicle and first results of cold starts and driveability testing indicate that the fuel system operates satisfactorily. Compatibility problems with ma- terials exposed to the blend have been encountered and will be reported. 821188. (SP-527) Emissions, fuel economy, and drivea- bility effects of methanol/butanol/gasoline fuel blends. Robert L. Furey, General Motors Re- search Laboratories, Warren, MI.; and Jack B. King, General Motors Advanced Product and Manufacturing Engineering Staff, Warren, MI. The immediate effects of methanol-gasoline blends on vehicle emissions, fuel economy, and driveability were investigated. The addition of a 2:1 mixture of methyl and butyl alcohols to gasoline, to provide a total alcohol concentration of either 10 percent or 18 percent, resulted in higher evaporative emissions, lower carbon monoxide emissions, lower volumetric fuel economy, and poorer driveability. Exhaust hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions decreased with some cars and increased with others. The closed-loop fuel metering systems, with which some of the test cars were equipped, could not completely compensate for the leaning effect of the alcohols. 821192 Consequently, the results of this test program suggest that these alcohol-gasoline blends would not be satisfactory for use in many cars either with or without closed-loop systems. 821189. (SP-527) Fuel vaporization improves fuel econ- omy of alcohol-burning SI engines. H. O. Hard- enberg, A. J. Schaefer, and H. I. Metsch, Daimler-Benz AG (Stuttgart, Germany). Fuel vaporization and combustion of the thereby achieved homogeneous mixtures improve the overall efficiency of SI engines in comparison to operation with liquid fuels. The improvements result from a recovery of waste heat and thus achieved greater usable energy of the fuel, which is increased by the heat of vaporization over the lower calorific value of the liquid fuel, and from the fact that very lean mixtures can be burnt without misfiring. The favorable fuel economy of the air/fuel-vapor mixture- aspirating engine is explained with the aid of engine cycle computation which also enables comparison of different combustion processes. Consideration of common sub- stances shows that methanol is the fuel best suited for this type of SI engine. 821190. (SP-527) A highly efficient alcohol vapor aspi- rating spark-ignition engine with heat recovery. H. K. Bergmann, Daimler-Benz AG (Stuttgart, W. Germany). The fuel properties of the lower alcohols indicate that both, straight methanol and ethanol are fundamentally unsuitable for utilization in the compression ignition process. In order to achieve the optimum possible benefit from the specific advantages of these alcohols, the alcohol-gas engine concept has been developed by Daimler-Benz. Due to partial recovery of the engine's waste heat by fuel vaporization and extreme lean burn capability, remarkable engine efficiencies are obtained. Design, performance, further development and instal- lation of this system in prototype city buses are described. 821192. Proposal of new exhaust emission compliance and testing procedures based on averaging. Horst Klingenberg and Dieter Schürmann, Volks- wagenwerk AG (Germany). The efforts made by Congress and Government Agencies in the past decade to limit the exhaust emissions and fuel consumption of motor vehicles led to a variety of complex measuring and testing procedures which are also inter- related. Unfortunately, these many procedures have a lot of discrepancies, weaknesses and uncertainties. Even more, they are not compatible and lead therefore to contra- dictions. In this paper we are presenting another proposal of a set of testing procedures, designed to avoid the disad- vantages recognized as such. We recommend to change the basic philosophy of today's emission testing. The fundamental basis of our proposal is the averaging concept applied to vehicles in 151</page><page sequence="133">821192 use, i.e. the sales weighted fleet average of in-use vehicles is compared to the applicable standard.

Gandhi, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Co.; and E. E. Weaver, Automotive Emissions and Fuel Econ- omy Office, Ford Motor Co. Post-mortem analyses of 50,000 mi (80,000 km) vehicle- aged catalysts revealed that the use of 0.125g Mn/gal (33 mg/L) as MMT (methylcyclopentadieny manganese tricarbonyl) significantly reduces phosphorus and zinc retention levels at the catalyst inlets by ~ 20-fold and ~5-fold, respectively. In subsequent laboratory pulsator experiments the presence of 0.016 to 0.1 57g Mn (as MMT)/gal (4 to 41 mg/L) isooctane fuel containing a 10-fold excess of ZDP (zinc dialkyldithiophosphate, source of oil P and Zn) similarly reduced the retention of P and Zn on TWCs by proportional amounts, while the TWCs maintained significantly higher 3-way conversions than in the absence of MMT. The combustion of Mn from MMT to very stable Mn304 probably serves as a scavenger in the exhaust for transporting away fuel- and 011-derived catalyst poisons such as P, Zn, and Pb. The utility of the laboratory results will require verification in vehicle studies. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821194. Advances in quantitative analytical ferrography and the evaluation of a high gradient magnetic separator for the study of diesel engine wear. David N. Anderson, Christopher J. Hubert, and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. Several sources of variation in quantitative analytical ferrography are investigated. A standard ferrography analysis procedure is developed. Normalization of ferro- graphic data to account for the amount of oil used to make the ferrograms is discussed. Procedures to minimize the errors involved with calculating three quantitative ferrography parameters: the area covered by the large particles, AL (%/ml of oil), the area covered by the small particles, As (%/ml of oil) and Area Under the Curve, AUC, (%-mm/ml of oil) are outlined. Ferrographic data are presented which show that the volume and dilution ratio of the oil sample being analyzed have a major effect on the accuracy of the analysis. Several variables which influence the area covered readings of the particle deposit on a ferrogram are discussed. The accuracy of quanti- tative analytical ferrography is assessed. Quantitative analytical ferrography is used to evaluate a high gradient magnetic separator, both as a tool for engine wear research and as an oil filter. Laboratory tests indicate the high gradient magnetic separator is an order of magnitude more efficient than conventional paper oil filters in removing magnetic wear debris from the lubricating oil. A mathematical model is presented which relates the concentration of wear particles in the lubricating oil to engine wear rate and the efficiency of the oil filter. The model predicts that an equilibrium wear particle concen- tration is reached. Experimental ferrography data from a turbocharged, direct injection, 4-cycle, diesel engine confirm that an equilibrium wear particle concentration is reached after several hours of steady state operation. This is based on curve fitting the ferrography data to the mathematical model. The HGMS is used to clean up the debris in the oil between tests. 821195. A model and the methodology for determining wear particle generation rate and filter efficiency in a diesel engine using ferrography. Christopher J. Hubert, John W. Beck, and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological University. Monitoring of the wear rate of a diesel engine will yield valuable information regarding the wear mechanism within a diesel engine and ultimately will improve the predictions of failing engines and/or their components to allow preventive maintenance which will prolong the life of the engine. A mathematical model was developed that describes the wear particle concentration as a function of time in a diesel engine. This model contains engine and lubrication system parameters that determine the concentration of wear particles in the engine sump. These variables are the oil system volume, oil flow rate, particle generation rate, filtering efficiency and the initial particle concentration. The model has been employed to study the wear particle concentrations in the sump and the mass of particles in the filter for the Cummins VT-903 diesel engine. In addition, the model was used to develop a testing methodology for determining wear particle generation rates and filter efficiencies from used oil analysis. This testing methodology uses ferrography together with computer programs to yield accurate statistical infor- mation on the data as curve fit to the model. The test set up incorporated a remote controlled sampling system that enabled the accurate and periodic taking of oil samples over an approximate five hour engine test. Results of this research indicate that equilibrium wear particle concentrations increase with an increase in engine speed and load. The wear particle generation rate and filter efficiency as determined by the test methodology were found to decrease with an increase in engine speed and load. After oil and filter changes, the wear particle generation rate and filter efficiency continually increased with cumulative engine time up to approximately 11 hours. The test methods used to obtain the results above were found to be repeatable to within ±15% and could conceivably be employed to determine wear parameters on other diesel engines as well as the effects of other engine variables such as lubricants, oil temperature, coolant temperature and engine components have on the wear parameters. 152</page><page sequence="134">821196. Wear performance of an SAE O W -30 partial- synthetic motor oil under high speed driving conditions. D. E. Flathmann, R. F. Barker, and W. S. Wylie, Shell Canada Ltd. Three pairs of cars were each driven over 80 000 km at predominantly highway speeds and summer ambient temperatures. One car of each pair used an SAE OW-30 partial-synthetic motor oil, and the other used an SAE 10W-30 all-mineral motor oil. These oils were of similar chemistry. The test has demonstrated that the low viscosity, SAE OW-30 oil offered comparable performance to the SAE 1 0W-30 oil, in terms of engine wear and cleanliness. Excellent connecting rod and main bearing wear, and valve train wear protection was observed for both oils, even though their viscometric properties at high tempe- ratures and under high shear rate conditions are less than the minimum proposed by some engine manufacturers and researchers. 821197. A study of antiseizure properties of motor oils in crankshaft bearings. Tsunehiro Kotani, Shigehisa Yamada, Kazuhisa Okumura, and Yoshikazu Kobayashi, Daikyo Oil Co., Ltd. Relative comparison of the antiseizure properties of motor oils in crankshaft main bearing was studied by observing the sudden temperature rise at the surface treated bearing, fitted in a Japanese 1.8 1 gasoline engine, using twenty- eight experimental oils and five commercial low viscosity oils. The results obtained are as follows. 1. The antiseizure properties of the single grade oils depend directly on their viscosities, and higher viscosity oils have preferable property. 2. In case of the multigrade oils, viscosity index improvers (VIIs) play an important role, and the anti- seizure properties of the SAE 5W-30 oils vary from that of the SAE 20 single grade oil to the SÁE 30 single grade oil depending on the VII contained. 3. Detergent inhibitor packages and friction modifiers contained in the multigrade oils have a little effect on the antiseizure property. 821198. (SP-527) Performance and emissions of non- petroleum fuels in a direct-injection stratified charge SI engine. Lois E. Freeman, Richard J. Roby, and Granger K. Chui, Research, Ford Motor Co. Seven fuels derived from coal and shale resources were evaluated using a direct-injection stratified charge engine. The fuels were refined to different degrees which ranged from those typical of gasoline blending components to those similar to current gasoline. Results showed that fuels refined to have properties similar to gasoline performed like gasoline. The less refined fuels were limited in performance. The total carbon monoxide and the hydrocarbon emissions varied with the volatility of the fuels. Most fuels with a higher overall distillation curve generally gave 821201 higher hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. The NOx emissions increased with the percent aromatics in the fuels. The hydrocarbon emissions were found to increase with fuel viscosity. Within the range of engine operation, nearly all the fuels evaluated gave satisfactory performance. With some modifications, even the less refined fuels can be poten- tially suitable for use in this engine. 821199. (SP-527) Injection, atomization and combustion of carbon slurry fuels. Thomas W. Ryan, III, Timothy J. Callahan, Lee G. Dodge, and Clifford A. Moses, Energy Systems Research Div., Southwest Research Institute. Three different carbon blacks were used to formulate nine different slurries in DF-2. The Theological properties of each formulation were examined to determine deviations from Newtonian behavior. The spray characteristics of selected formulations were then examined in a high- pressure, high-temperature injection bomb. The cone angle decreased and the penetration rates increased for all of the slurries tested as compared to straight DF-2. These changes were more pronounced as the concentration of carbon black increased. Six formulations of three types of carbon black were tested in a single-cylinder, direct-injection CLR engine. Apparent heat release, rates were computed as a function of crankangle from the cylinder pressure data. Based on the engine performance tests and some limited durability testing it appears that well-formulated carbon black slurries have only minor effects on engine performance and durability.

Hydrogen has been suggested, in recent years, as an alternate fuel for the spark-ignition, otto-cycle engine. When hydrogen is used in this manner, the combustion characteristics in the cyclic engine conditions become increasingly important. This paper describes engine experiments with hydrogen as the fuel. Initial work is presented in which it is found that combustion is essentially complete at maximum cylinder pressure. Based on this operating characteristic of the hydrogen fuel, burning times and spatial burning velocities are given for a number of conditions of engine speed and compression ratio. 821201. A computer model for the prediction of vapor lock in the fuel pump of a carburetted engine. J. K. Pearson, Shell Research, SA.; and B. D. Cad- dock and P. L. Orman, Shell Research, Ltd. In the manufacture of gasoline the front-end volatility needs to be carefully controlled in order to avoid hot fuel handling problems in service. Modern front-end volatility controls are intended primarily to provide protection 153</page><page sequence="135">821201 against fuel pump vapour lock, which is believed to be the main field problem. In recognition of this a mathematical model has been developed which is capable of predicting the effects of changes in fuel composition and ambient temperature on the tendency of a car to exhibit fuel pump vapour lock problems. The model requires the fuel to be described by means of a low-resolution g.l.c. analysis, and an effort has been made to minimize the number of car characteristics needed for the computer simulation of the standard hot fuel handling test. Validation of the model for three car types with substantially different inlet system configurations has been achieved. The possibility of extending the model to cover hot fuel handling problems originating in the carburetter is discussed in a separate paper. 821202. Carburetter foaming and its influence on the hot weather performance of motor vehicles. V. M. Tertois and B. D. Caddock, Shell Research, Ltd. A reappraisal of the hot fuel handling problems origi- nating in the carburetter has been made. Experiments have been made using carburetters with transparent sections that enabled the behaviour of the fuel in the float bowl to be filmed during various modes of engine operation. Under certain well-defined conditions of temperature, fuel pressure at the carburetter inlet and fuel composition, the occurrence of engine malfunctions coincided with the presence of gross amounts of fuel foam in the carburetter bowl. This interfered with the normal operation of the system and led to the expulsion of a large quantity of fuel through the carburetter vent and, because the vent was blocked by the foam, caused an overpressure to develop in the bowl. These events created an excessive enrichment of the mixture aspirated by the engine and caused severe driveability problems, which were very similar to those associated with the fuel starvation caused by vapour lock. SÄE Trans., Vol. 91 821203. Cold weather driveability performance of 1975- 1981 model cars. Alan M. Horowitz and Marta S. Stawnychy, Mobil Research &amp; Development Corp. Low and intermediate (25° F and 45 °F) temperature controlled driveability tests were conducted with 1975, 1977 and 1981 model year cars. Cold-start and warm-up driveability of the test fleets improved from 1975 to 1977 to 1981. Results of individual car and fuel tests show much greater variation among cars than among fuels. No attempt was made to investigate causes of the large performance differences among cars; the smaller per- formance differences among fuels were found to be related to changes in the fuels' 10%, 50% and 90% evaporated temperatures. The 50% evaporated temper- ature was found to be the most important predictor of fuel performance, with the 10% evaporated temperature being almost equally important. As expected, the results in each of the individual programs also indicate improved average driveability performance with increasing ambient test temperature-about 25% fewer performance problems at 45°F than at 25°F. 821204. Considerations on the influence of rheological properties of lubricants on engine lubrication. Wilfried J. Bartz, Technical Academy Esslingen, Federal Republic of Germany. Viscosity represents the most important single property of any lubricant for internal combustion engines. The reason for this fact is that viscosity controls friction or lubrication regimes and consequently wear and performance life of the engine. Because of viscosity depending on temperature, pressure, and often shear rate, the local viscosity at the frictional contacts defined as effective viscosity will be responsible for the friction and wear situation at a specific location within the engine. 821205. The effect of fuel-saving engine oils on journal bearing load capacity - a radiometric evaluation. Eric W. Schneider and Richard C. Rosenberg, General Motors Research Laboratories, General Motors Corp., Warren, MI. Radiometric wear techniques have been applied to determine the effect of fuel-saving engine oils on journal bearing load capacity. A test machine which applied a unidirectional load to a radioactive test bearing was used to evaluate bearing load capacity. The onset of bearing wear with increasing load provided a direct measurement of fluid-film breakdown, which defined hydrodynamic bearing load capacity. From this, an "effective" lubricant viscosity was calculated by comparing the performance of non-Newtonian lubricants to the performance of New- tonian lubricants. Results show that for the oil formu- lations tested that employ either a low viscosity or a soluble friction modifier to reduce engine friction, there is a high correlation between high-shear viscosity and hydrodynamic load capacity. The use of an insoluble friction modifier resulted in a higher bearing load capacity than expected based on high-shear viscosity. Discussion: J. K. Appeldoorn, Exxon Research and Engineering Co. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821206. Summary of ASTM activities on low temperature engine oil pumpability. Ross M. Stewart, Gulf Research and Development Co. (Retired).; Har- old Shaub, Exxon Research and Engineering Co.; Marvin F. Smith, Jr., Paramins Technology Div., Exxon Chemical Co.; and Ted W. Selby, Savant, Inc. At SAE's request, ASTM developed both an oil pumpa- bility engine test and a bench test, the Mini-Rotary Viscometer (MRV). The MRV data correlated well with the full scale engine pumpability data. SAE then incor- porated MRV requirements for Winter Grade oils into the Viscosity Classification System J-300 SEP80. A large number of engine oil pumpability failures occurred during the winter of 1980-81. In early 1981, ASTM, SAE and several companies started crash pro- 154</page><page sequence="136">grams to solve the problem. These programs showed that those failure oils had a different sensitivity to cooldown cycle than the Pumpability Reference Oils (PROs) used in the original correlations. The cooldown cycle in the Federal Stable Pour Test appeared to better predict the 1980-81 failure oils, whereas the D3829 MRV cooldown cycle predicted the original PROs the best. Therefore, the Federal Stable Pour Test in combination with the Mini-Rotary Viscometer was recommended as a "stop- gap" measure. Short term, ASTM organized a Federal Stable Pour Test Task Force to gather information on the Federal test method. This Task Force is now running a round-robin program with this test, using two different cooling cycles. Longer term, progress is being made in defining a new MRV cooldown cycle that will identify all oils having unacceptable engine pumpability in the field. Work is also progressing with a Liquid Bath Brookfield Scanning procedure. 821209. The Phillips Small Sample Motor Octane Number Method. W. V. Childs and E. H. Vickery, Phillips Petroleum Co., Research and Development, Bartlesville, OK. The Phillips Small Sample Octane Number (SSON) Methods (Research and Motor) were developed from the ASTM methods by replacing the ASTM fuel metering system with a variable stroke positive displacement metering pump, the fuel selector valve with an automatic valve, and by using digital signal processing procedures. The pump, fuel sampling, and signal processing are under computer control. Important features include direct comparison of each test fuel with two primary reference fuels, signal averaging to enhance signal-to-noise ratio, and digital recording of the transducer output before processing. The transducer used is a standard D1 pickup which produces a voltage that is proportional to the rate-of-change of pressure within the engine cylinder. This report describes the application of SSON tech- niques to the determination of Motor Octane Numbers (MON), and compares SSON results directly to ASTM results. The SSON method takes only six minutes and requires a twenty ml sample of test fuel. The standard ASTM method takes twenty to twenty-five minutes and 400 ml of test fuel. 821210. Pre-ignition and knock behavior of alcohol fuels. Holger Menrad, Volkswagen Research, Wolfs- burg, Germany.; and Manfred Haselhorst and Walter Erwig, Veba Oel, Gelsenkirchen, Ger- many. The design and adjustment of modern engines is limited by combustion behavior of the fuels. In the application of present fuels knock is the dominating factor, usually defined as Research - and Motor Octane Numbers (RON and MON). Alternative fuels prove to be different in some cases. So some engines react more sensitive with regard to knock as to be expected from the octane numbers when oxygenated fuels are utilized. In the application of alcohol 821213 fuels pre-ignition is an important factor besides knock, mainly in case of methanol. The investigation of pre-ignition and knock effects in high compression alcohol engines answers the question how the adjustment parameters such as air-fuel ratio, ignition timing and the temperatures of intake air and water will have an influence. As pre-ignition is a fuel property, a relation to other fuel properties, for instance octane numbers, is expected. It was found that the knock sensitivity gives a correlation to pre-ignition effects.

Ingamells, Chevron Research Co. A gasoline Road Octane study was conducted by the Coordinating Research Council (CRC) to evaluate the effects of heavy aromatics (C9 and heavier) and ethanol content on Road Octane performance independent of Research Octane Number (RON) and Motor Octane Number (MON). Maximum-throttle and part-throttle Road ON's were found to be well predicted by equations containing only RON and MON terms. Heavier aromatics were found to have a small adverse effect on both maximum-throttle and part-throttle Road ON independ- ent of its direct effects on RON and MON. The all-car data did not show a significant ethanol- content effect, but eight of the thirty-seven cars did show significant effects for ethanol content. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821212. Further analysis of the effects of heavy aromatics and ethanol on gasoline road octane ratings. John C. Ingamells and Edward R. Jones, Chevron Research Company, Richmond, California. A Road octane study conducted by the Coordinating Research Council showed heavy aromatics in gasoline to have a small adverse effect on Road octane number; but ethanol content, which was also evaluated, was not found to be a significant factor. In this paper, the data are analyzed further by introducing car design variables in addition to heavy aromatics, ethanol, and the two laboratory engine octane tests. This analysis shows 10% ethanol in gasoline to have a small but beneficial effect on Road octane number independent of laboratory octane quality. The average effects in the two analyses were nearly identical, but the statistical significance of the effects differed. 821213. Superior performance from high-qualîty diesel engine oils. J. R. Lohuis, Mobil Research and Development Corp.; and M. Thompson, Mobil Oil Co., Limited. Considerable activity is progressing to define lubricants with improved performance to meet the severe demands of modern automotive diesel engines. This paper discusses 155</page><page sequence="137">821213 monograde and multigrade diesel engine oils formulated to provide superior performance with respect to ring sticking, cylinder bore polishing, oil consumption, valve train wear, alkalinity retention and engine cleanliness in severe turbocharged diesel engines. These high-quality diesel engine oils exceed current industry requirements and meet the severest performance specifications of major European and U.S. builders. This performance is dem- onstrated in single and multi-cylinder engine dynamom- eter tests including several proprietary procedures. Field testing in severe fleets under extended drain conditions confirms the superior quality of these lubricants compared to conventional diesel engine oils. 821216. The effects of piston temperature and fuel sulfur on diesel engine piston deposits. J. A. McGeehan, B. J. Fontana, and J. D. Kramer, Chevron Research Co., Richmond, CA. This paper reports results from a quantitative study on the effects of diesel piston temperature and fuel sulfur on piston deposits. Tests were conducted in a four-cycle, turbocharged single-cylinder engine using uncompounded oils and distillate fuel. This fundamental study demonstrated that at constant exhaust smoke, piston temperature between 200°C to 260°C is the primary factor in controlling piston top groove deposit formation. The activation energy for this process was determined to be 12 kcal/mole, which is within the normal range of chemical reactions. The rate of top groove deposit formation doubled for every 30°C rise in piston temperature. Piston temperature also increased total piston deposits on all grooves and lands. Fuel sulfur in the range of 0 to 1.0 wt % had no effect on top groove deposit formation, although it did increase lower groove and lower land deposits. Crankcase oil oxidation appeared to correlate with piston temperature. The activation energy for this process was determined to be 5 kcal/mole. The rate of crankcase oil oxidation doubled for each 67 °C increase in piston top groove temperature. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821217. Characterization of diesel particulates by mass spectrometry including ms-ms. Karl V. Wood, Automotive Transportation Center, Purdue Univ.; James D. Ciupek and R. Graham Cooks, Department of Chemistry, Purdue Univ.; and Colin R. Ferguson, School of Mechanical En- gineering, Purdue Univ. Particles have been collected from a direct injection diesel engine at varying dilution ratios and air temperatures for four different operating conditions. Particulate samples have been introduced into a mass spectrometer ion source with a direct insertion probe thus dispensing with the extraction processes typically used in chemical charac- terization. The sample is volatized and then chemically ionized using isobutane. Typical mass spectra are presented for each operating condition. The samples analyzed have a mean molecular weight of 195 amu with a standard deviation of approximately 100 amu. Application of tandem mass spectrometry for species identification is illustrated. Both negative and positive chemical ionization are employed to identify carboxylic acids in the particulate. Several types of ms-ms scans are shown to have utility in this study, including scans which provide molecular weight profiles for compounds having common functional groups. This latter methodology is shown to be a particularly rapid and sensitive procedure for following changes in emission characteristics in response to altered engine conditions. 821218. A computer heat transfer and hydrocarbon adsorption model for predicting diesel particulate emissions in dilution tunnels. James C. Clerc, Chevron Research Co.; and John H. Johnson, Michigan Technological Univ. The prediction of particulate concentrations in diesel exhaust diluted in a dilution tunnel has been achieved using a computer model. The particulate collection filter temperature, soluble organic fraction (SOF) and solids fraction (SOL) of diesel particulate matter were predicted based on exhaust system and dilution tunnel variables that could be measured on a real-time basis. The SOF was assumed to be formed by adsorption of gaseous hydro- carbons onto the solids fraction. The accuracy of the model was determined by comparison to experimentally measured values. The model was able to predict SOF concentrations within 35%, filter temperatures within 3°C, and particulate (SOF + SOL) concentrations within 25% of measured values. A parametric study was conducted using the developed model; and improved test procedures, dilution tunnel dimensions, and federal testing guidelines were suggested. SAE Trans., Vol . 91 821219. Determination of polycyciic aromatic hydrocar- bons in diluted and undiluted exhaust gas of diesel engines. Joachim Kraft, Alfred Härtung, Juergen Schulze, and Karl-Heinz Lies, Volkswagenwerk AG (Germany). A method for the determination of polycyciic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the diluted exhaust of diesel vehicles is described. Sampling is done by drawing off continuous proportional streams out of the dilution tunnel. The particulate samples collected on filters are sublimated, purified and prefractionated by silica gel. Glass capillary gas chromatography and thin-layer chromatography coupled with in situ fluorescence spec- trometry are used. Results of theoretical considerations and experimental data on the portion of the emitted PAH adsorbed by particulate matter and on the portion of the PAH in the gas phase in diluted diesel exhaust are presented. A modified Langmuir adsorption model is used to explain the effects of dilution ratio and sample temperature on the portion of the adsorbed PAH. 156</page><page sequence="138">Furthermore, the methods for the determination of PAH in diluted and undiluted exhaust are discussed with regard to the general expense, necessary equipment, accuracy and reproducibility.

Watts, Shell Research Ltd., Thornton Research Centre, Chester, England. A high resolution study of the early stages of flame development in a spark ignition engine has been per- formed. Full flame velocity distributions are presented and are discussed in terms of the nature and causes of fluctuations in the flame propagation. The simultaneous sampling óf a number of engine variables such as gas velocity, flame velocity, pressure etc. is necessary for a more complete description of the controlling variables. Techniques are described and data presented for such a multiple sampling experiment. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821221. The effects of ignition location in a swirl field on homogeneous-charge combustion. E. G. Groff and J. F. Sinnamon, Engine Research De- partment, General Motors Research Laborato- ries. The effects of ignition location on combustion duration, thermal efficiency, exhaust emissions, cyclic variability, and knock sensitivity were investigated in two premixed- charge spark-ignition engines with disk-shaped combus- tion chambers and having high levels of swirl. Except for very lean high-swirl conditions, peripheral ignition pro- duced a longer combustion duration than did central ignition, but the difference was less than expected from geometric considerations alone. Flame holding at the spark electrodes, observed in high-speed schlieren films, enhances mass-burning rates for off-center ignition locations. For a swirl number of 4 no significant differences with ignition location were measured in thermal efficiency, heat-transfer losses, exhaust temper- ature, cyclic variability, or exhaust emissions, but with peripheral ignition the engine had a greater knock sensitivity, lower knock-limited peak power, and a misfire problem of unidentified origin. For a swirl number of 7 an increase in heat-transfer losses and a corresponding decrease in thermal efficiency were measured for pe- ripheral ignition. Thus with intake-generated swirl, central ignition was found to be desirable in the two engines tested. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821222. Examination of the performance of a dual fuel diesel engine with particular reference to the presence of some inert diluents in the engine intake charge. G. A. Karim and N. Amoozegar, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Can- 821226 ada. An examination of the combustion phenomena and associated engine performance is made for a dual fuel engine of the compression ignition type when additional auxiliary fuels and inerts were introduced with the main intake charge. This was considered to have direct relevance to operation of diesel engines on low heating value gaseous fuel mixtures. A single cylinder direct injection diesel engine was employed throughout. H2, CH4, C02 and N2 were the gas constituents used. Operation on gaseous fuel mixtures containing sig- nificant amounts of diluent inerts showed a marked deterioration of the already inefficient combustion of lean fuel-air mixtures. Of the two inert gases (C02 and N2) introduced in turn, C02 has a comparatively greater influence in narrowing the operating range of the engine. Both diesel and dual fuel operations were also considered when a spray of water was introduced into the intake of the engine. The quenching of the charge resulting from water addition appeared to slow down the combustion rates, necessitating the supply of a certain minimum amount of gaseous fuel and diesel pilot for adequate combustion. 821223. Generalised procedure for flame and combustion chamber surface determination in S I engines. P. A. Lakshminarayanan and J. C. Dent, De- partment of Mechanical Engineering, Lough- borough University of Technology. A generalised computational procedure for the evaluation of the geometry of convex flame surface and combustion chamber interaction is presented. A range of combustion chamber geometries have been evaluated for flame surface area, volume, and wall wetted area under the assumption of spherical flame development. The study shows the advantage of bowl in piston geometries with central ignition. Incorporation of the geometric scheme into a Thermodynamic combustion model corroborates the findings of the geometric study. 821226. Fuel economy factors in lubricants. J. G. Damrath and A. G. Papay, Edwin Cooper Division, Ethyl Corporation. This paper examines the various factors controlling the effect of lubricants on fuel economy. The main mecha- nisms that contribute to energy losses in a lubri- cant/machine system are discussed, and examples of the contributions of the corresponding parameters are given. Synergistic combinations of the principal energy-saving components are noted and applied, with an emphasis on engine oil formulations. It is concluded that the optimum 5W-30 formulation combines a base reinforced with a polyaphaolefin oligomer and a friction-modified additive package. This combination also would help solve other industry problems, such as low-temperature engine fail- ures and excess wear and blowby situations at high temperatures. 157</page><page sequence="139">821227 821227. Taxicab fuel economy and engine and rear axle durability with low-viscosity and friction-modified lubricants. M. L. Haviland and J. L. Linden, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Labs., Warren, MI. A 55-taxicab fleet test was conducted for 160 000 km to determine the effects of low-viscosity and friction- modified engine oils and rear axle lubricants on fuel economy and durability. In GM City-Suburban and 80 km/h constant-speed tests conducted at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, fuel economy with low-viscosity engine oil and rear axle liibricant combinations was about 1 to 2 percent greater than that with SAE 10W-40 engine oil and SAE 80W-90 rear axle lubricant. These improvements were obtained after 40 000 and 80 000 km of taxicab service. Fuel economy with a graphite-containing SAE 10W-40 engine oil was about 2.5 percent better in both tests. No differences in either engine or rear axle durability were observed among the lubricants. However, oil economy with low-viscosity engine oils was about 20 to 30 percent less than that with the SAE 10W-40 oil. Adding either graphite or MoS2 to an SAE 5W-30 engine oil did not affect oil economy or oil performance, but oil filter plugging was increased in high-mileage cabs. Oil filter plugging increased with increasing engine oil viscosity, filter change interval, and cab mileage. It is concluded that the use of energy-conserving lubricants improves fuel economy for both low- and high-mileage vehicles, without adversely affecting vehicle durability. The significance of this conclusion is that vehicles on the road can benefit from the use of such lubricants. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821228. A transportable test cell for vehicle emissions and fuel consumption measurement. N. D. Eryou and D. MacMartin, DEW Engineering &amp; Devel- opment Ltd.; and S. M. Dubuc and D. Gourley, Environment Canada, Environmental Protection Service. A transportable test cell for the measurement of motor vehicle emissions and fuel consumption was developed for Environment Canada. The test cell incorporates a bus containing exhaust gas analyzers and the dynamome- ter/exhaust gas sampling control system plus a trailer mounted electric absorption chassis dynamometer, which rejects absorbed vehicle energy into the local utility grid. The test cell was developed for testing of in-use motor vehicles with curb weights up to 2726 kg (6000 lbs) in major Canadian urban centers. It is designed for all- weather road transport and easy deployment, requiring only connections to a building power supply. The design and operation of the test cell are described, along with its intended use. 821230. 1980 Prince Edward Island auto fuel economy and emissions test program. Leslie T. Russell, De- partment of Mechanical Engineering, Technical University of Nova Scotia, Halifax, N.S.; and John C. Polak, New Vehicle Section, Mobile Sources Div., Environment Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. A program of emission testing and carburetor adjustment to reduce the levels of hydrocarbons and carbon mon- oxide in the exhaust gases and to demonstrate fuel economy improvements was held in Charlottestown during the week of July 14 to 19, 1980. The program was a cooperative effort of the Centre of Energy Studies of the Technical University of Nova Scotia, the Mobile Sources Division of the Air Pollution Control Directorate, Envi- ronment Canada and the Prince Edward Island Energy Corporation. Five hundred and twenty vehicles were tested during the period. The program was well received by the public and indicated that only 32% of the vehicle fleet were within specification when initially tested. A large percentage of these vehicles were satisfactorily adjusted. Mailback record cards were used to obtain an indication of the improved fuel economy. The data suggests that a substantial saving in fuel can be attained through carburetor tuning for low exhaust emissions. 821231. The effects of diesel fuel properties and engine operating conditions on ignition delay. C. L. Wong and D. E. Steere, Imperial Oil Limited. The effects of diesel fuel properties and engine operating conditions on ignition delay have been studied using a single cylinder, direct injection, 4-cycle diesel engine. It was found that in the warmed up engine ignition delay increases non-linearly with decrease in the cetane number of the fuel, increasing rapidly at cetane numbers below 35. Variations in the volatility and ignition quality of the front-end of the diesel fuel were found to have no effect on ignition delay. Fuels containing cetane improver additive were found to give similar ignition delay at various torques relative to natural diesel fuels of the same cetane number. At constant RPM, increase in the engine power by increasing the fuel injection rate resulted in linear decrease in the ignition delay. Ignition delay was also shortened by increasing the intake-air pressure, as well as the oil, coolant and intake-air temperatures. Therefore, under fully warmed-up conditions, the engine was found to perform well at high torque even when using a low cetane fuel. However, under low torque and partially warmed-up conditions, the engine misfired frequently and resulted in sluggish performance. Since the cetane number (ASTM D613) is determined under one particular set of operating conditions, the validity of using it to predict performance at other operating conditions will be discussed.

Cliffe, Shell Canada Ltd., Products Application Dept. 158</page><page sequence="140">A major research program has been undertaken to assess the diesel fuel requirements of a broad spectrum of diesel engines, primarily in terms of ignition quality. The fuel requirements of several light and heavy duty diesel engines have been evaluated in programs completed on the road and in a climate controlled chassis dynamometer. Diesel fuels of various qualities representative of current and projected production have been evaluated in these engines over the temperature range of -20 to 25 °C. Engine performance has been rated in terms of cold startability, cold smoke, noise, power, fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. These evaluations are preliminary to a much larger program and further details will be published at a future date. 821233. Effect of low cetane fuels on diesel engine operation: 1 - preliminary runs on Detroit Diesel 3-71 engine. R. B. Whyte and B. W. Moyes, National Research Council of Canada. Three fuels with cetane numbers of 45, 36 and 29 have been run at four load levels at each of three speeds in a Detroit Diesel 3-71 engine with standard injectors. Measurements of temperatures, pressures, load, fuel flow, cylinder pressure in one cylinder, strain gauge meas- urements from the rocker arm operating one injector and exhaust emissions were all recorded. Comparisons show little change in operation except for increases in ignition delay and rate of cylinder pressure rise with the low cetane fuels. It was concluded, on the basis of these short runs, that the intermediate fuel probably would not cause major difficulties but the lowest cetane fuel could possibly present problems with noise and engine durability. 821234. Development of a new cold filterabllity test for automotive diesel fuels. J. D. Rummel, Cities Service Co. A new laboratory test, the Coal Filterability Index (CFI), has been developed to measure the low temperature filterability of automotive diesel fuels. The following continuous variables were investigated: sample initial temperature, final test temperature, rate of chilling of the sample, pressure applied to the filter assembly, time held at the lowest temperature, and volume of sample. Within the limits investigated, only the final test temperature was found to significantly affect the outcome of the CFI test. The test procedure is of short time duration and has good repeatability as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Results of the CFI test have been found to correlate well with the Low Temperature Filterability Test (LTFT). 821235. (SP-526) Hydrotreated lube oil base stocks. K. Cashmore, M. Moyle, and P. J.

(SP-526) The effect of base stock composition on lubricant performance. D. W. Murray, C. T. Clarke, G. A. MacAlpine, and P. G. Wright, Imperial Oil Limited, Research Dept. From detailed studies of the changes in base oil compo- sition which occur during service, and by relating these changes to the accepted mechanisms of hydrocarbon autoxidation, it appears possible to select key base stock compositional parameters which generally predict the relative performance of formulated products in standard industry tests. The relevant compositional parameters depend, however, on the specific test method: tests which finish before the added inhibitor is entirely depleted are controlled primarily by the concentration of saturated hydrocarbons in the base stock; those which finish after disappearance of the inhibitor (e.g., Sequence HID) are influenced more by the hydroperoxide decomposing components (mainly sulphur compounds) in the base stock. By applying this understanding of lubricant oxidation, good correlations with base stock composition are being obtained for a variety of bench engine and laboratory oxidation tests including the Sequence HID, Sequence V-D and Caterpillar 1H2, as well as the ASTM D2272 and D943 tests.

(SP-526) Relationship between lubricating base- stock composition and the effects of additives on oxidation stability. S. M. Hsu and C. S. Ku, National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC.; and R. S. Lin, Chinese Petroleum Corp., Taiwan (NBS Guest Worker). Over fifty lubricating base oils from various crude sources and processing technologies, including ten re-refined base oils, have been studied. An SE/CC additive package was added to the base oils and the effects of the additives on oxidation stability of the oils were measured by a thin film oxygen uptake test. This oxidation test has demonstrated correlation with ASTM engine sequence HID viscosity increase results. Chemical composition parameters such as sulfur, nitrogen, basic nitrogen, polar, saturate, and aromatic contents were systematically examined for correlation with the effects of additives on oxidation stability. Combinations of these compositional parameters were also investigated. Large differences in oxidation induction times of the various basestocks were found. Some of the differences could be related to the saturate and the sulfur content of the base oils. 821238.

Diesters of dodecanedioic acid (DDDA) have been found to exhibit frictional, antiwear and viscosity-temperature properties which are superior to those of other dibasic acid esters, synthetic hydrocarbons and petroleum oils. A OW-30 part synthetic motor oil which contained 43% di(isooctyl)dodecanedioate (DIOD) readily passed HID, V-D and L-38 sequence engine tests. This oil also showed a 4.7% fuel economy benefit versus an SAE-30 oil when tested in a diesel-powered automobile. Laboratory bench wear test data suggested that DIOD could be useful as a low level (5-10%) blending component in automotive lubricants. It not only brings about friction and wear reductions when added to petroleum oils but also leads to reductions when added to other synthetic base oils such as adipate diesters and polyalphaolefins. 821239. (SP-526) A field and laboratory comparison of a re-refined and a virgin automotive engine oil. J. Armstrong, Environment Canada, Waste Man- agement Branch.; and P. L. Strigner, National Research Council of Canada, Fuels and Lubri- cants Laboratory. A field test and laboratory analysis program, including the four SE engine tests, was carried out to evaluate the comparative performance characteristics of a virgin and an acid/clay re-refined API-SE/SAE 20W-40 automotive engine lubricating oil under selected operating conditions. The two oils had the same additive package. Eight new police patrol cars, four on virgin and four on re-refined oil, were run in 1979/80 under normal fleet operation and maintenance practices for 100 000 km. The fleet oil change interval was 5000 km. All engines were disas- sembled and rated at the end of their fleet service. There were no oil related problems. Engine vehicle parts showed normal wear and deposits. Some small differences, however, were noted in the used oil properties, engine sequence tests and field engine ratings. In general, both oils operated satisfactorily and were considered substan- tially equivalent. 821240. (SP-526) Re-refined base oil characterization and consistency monitoring. S. M. Hsu, C. S. Ku, and D. A. Becker, National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC. Re-refined lubricating base oils are base oils derived from reprocessing of used lubricating oils to remove contam- inants, oxidized products, and additives. Early studies suggested that the basic molecular structures of the hydrocarbons were not altered in use, and there were no systematic variations in either contaminants or compo- sitions in the used oils from geographical or seasonal variations. Various processing technologies are available to remove the contaminants from used oil, most notably the acid/clay process. The acid/clay process has long been used throughout the world and was the dominant process in 1976 when National Bureau of Standards (NBS) initiated its Recycled Oil Program. Due to the environmental problems associated with the disposal of acid sludge, the acid/clay process is rapidly being displaced by new ones: e.g. hydrogénation, vacuum distillation, short-path distillation, solvent extraction. Most new processes have some pretreatment steps to remove sludge, water, and additive metals. Re-refined base oils are primarily in the 200-400 neutral range. The light ends in the original base oils are lost through evaporation during the use cycle. The very heavy ends are usually removed during re-refining. Under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (1975) the National Bureau of Standards is required to study re-refined lubricating base oils and develop test proce- dures to assess the substantial equivalency between re-refined and virgin oil products. In order to help fulfill this responsibility, a detailed study was made of the comparison between the re-refined and virgin base oil. Seventeen lubricating base oils were selected for detailed characterization in these studies, ten re-refined and seven virgin base oils. These base oils represent a cross-section of available processing technologies, crude sources, and viscosity grades. This paper describes the detailed char- acterization of these seventeen oils and discusses the various aspects of quality and consistency associated with re-refined base oils. Based on these results, a tentative set of test procedures is recommended for monitoring the quality and consistency of re-refined base oils for automotive applications. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821242. (SP-526) Significant considerations in selecting base stocks for automatic transmission fluids. R. A. Bagnali and B. Swinney, Research and Development, Gulf Canada Limited. The results of numerous laboratory bench tests and over-the-road field tests conducted on fluids blended with base stocks of varying physical properties are compared. The effects of using oils derived from solvent-refining versus those manufactured from a hydrotreating process are examined. Other areas investigated include comparisons of high vs. low VI; light vs. medium grade neutrals; and additive response to these differing base stocks. Although high viscosity index (HVI), hydrotreated, medium grade neutrals generally gave superior results in the tests performed, it was determined ATF's blended with light grade hydrotreated neutrals of low viscosity index (LVI) also showed promising results when evaluated against standard industry tests. 821243. The effect of hydrotreatment of diesel fuel derived from Canadian tar sands on particulate exhaust emissions. David L. Hilden and Stephen P. Bergin, Fuels and Lubricants Dept., General Motors Research Laboratories.; Harvey A. Burley, Advanced Product Engineering, General Motors Advanced Product and Manufacturing Engineering Staff.; and Ronald D. Tharby and Ian P. Fisher, Research and Development Dept., 160</page><page sequence="142">Gulf Canada, Ltd. Four combustion devices including a laminar diffusion flame burner, a light-duty single-cylinder diesel engine, a light-duty multicylinder diesel engine and a light-duty diesel-powered vehicle were used to evaluate the partic- ulate-forming tendencies of eight diesel-type fuels. Four of the fuels were produced from a single tar sands process stream by increasing, in steps, the severity of hydrotreat- ment they received. The particulate emissions were best correlated by multiple linear regressions with the aromatic carbon contents and ninety percent distilled temperatures of the fuels. The particulate emission indices for all four combustion devices decreased exponentially with in- creased hydrotreatment of the tar sands fuels. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821244. Analysis of factors affecting the formation of major mutagenic substances in diesel particulate extracts. Tsuneaki Saito, Naomi Tokura, and Tadanari Katoh, Central Engineering Labs., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Recently, mutagenicity of polynuclear aromatic hydro- carbons in particulate extracts of Diesel engine exhaust has been attracting attention. The effects of fuel injection system design and properties of fuel on the amount of two major mutagenic substances, i.e. 1-nitropyrene and benzo(a)pyren were analyzed in this study using a 4 cylinder IDI Diesel engine. Formation of 1-nitropyrene and benzo(a)pyren on the filter was also investigated. As the result, secondary injection from the fuel injection nozzle was found to be a principal factor in increasing these substances. Modification of the fuel injection system to suppress secondary injection can reduce these mutagenic substances. 821245. A new concentric-cylinder high-shear rate vis- cometer for measuring the viscosity of engine lubricants. N. van Os, A. K. van Helden, and W. van den Berg, Koninklijke/Shell-Laboratorium, Amsterdam (Shell Research B.V.) The Neth- erlands. A new Couette-type high-temperature, high-shear-rate viscometer capable of performing viscosity measurements at high temperatures (up to 150°C) and high shear rates (up to 3 X 106 s1) has been designed, developed and constructed at Koninklijke/Shell-Laboratorium, Amster- dam, the Netherlands. This paper highlights the important design and constructional aspects and modes of operation of this instrument, which has special features in terms of operational range, ease of experimental procedure, access to primary experimental quantities (such as gap width and oil film temperature) and data handling technique. It also describes the calibration of the new instrument and a first series of measurements with non-Newtonian CEC ref- erence oils at temperatures of 100°C and 150°C and shear rates up to 3 x 106 s~'. The latter results agree very well with those obtained by other workers employing different viscometers. The new viscometer has proven to be very suitable for the accurate determination of the rheological 821248 behaviour of engine lubricants at high temperatures and high rates of shear. 821246. Acid deposition in California. Douglas R. Law- son, Research Div., California Air Resources Board, Sacramento, CA.; and Jerome G. Wendt, Haagen-Smit Laboratory Div., California Air Resources Board, El Monte, CA. Precipitation chemistry measurements have been made at many California locations, with recorded extreme pH values as low as 2.89 from Pasadena and 3.5 from geologically sensitive Sequoia National Park. However, in northern areas of the state experiencing good air quality, very little acid deposition occurs. California's acid precipitation is apparently locally produced, since there are no major pollution source regions upwind of the state. This is attributable to the extremely rapid rates observed for conversion of NOx to nitric acid and S02 to sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Recent monitoring data illustrate extreme variations in precipitation chemistry from adja- cent sites and even at the same location from one year to the next. Enrichment factor calculations show that in contrast with data from other locations in the world, nitric acid dominates over sulfuric acid in California's rainfall in many locations. Measurements of total atmospheric deposition from Orange County in 1967-1968 show values of highest acidity near stationary point sources and during the winter months, when wind-blown dust deposition was minimal. It is estimated that during this period, only 18 percent of the total sulfate deposition in Orange County was in the form of wet deposition, emphasizing the importance of dry deposition in the Los Angeles area. The significance of atmospheric acidity in fogs and dews in California is discussed, as well as current research efforts sponsored by the California Air Resources Board. SAE Trans- Vol. 91 821247. Low temperature flow properties of engine oils. R. L. Stambaugh and J. H. O'Mara, Rohm «fe Haas Co. Laboratory engine pumpability studies indicate that engines known to have been involved in field failures during the winter of 1980-81 are not unduly severe. Oils having satisfactory MRV performance but poor Cycle C stable pour points can lead to pumping failures using realistic sixteen hour temperature cycles. Modified MRV tests show promise of correlation with engine perform- ance. Commercial oils with suspect properties were still available early in the winter of 1981-82. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821248. Comparisons of the effects of improved engine lubricants on automobile fuel economy, exhaust emissions, and lubricating properties. Ken B. Matthews, Michael R. Appleby, and Louis J. Bintz, Automobile Club of Southern California.; and David W. Griffiths, Castrol Research Lab- oratories. Four engine lubricants were evaluated against a reference 161</page><page sequence="143">821248 oil for fuel economy, exhaust emissions, horsepower output, oil consumption, and lubricating properties. Sixty 1977-79 automobiles were used for the evaluation, with each auto accumulating approximately 18,000 miles (28,980 KM). Fuel economy was measured by recording odometer readings and gallons used at each fill-up, and laboratory testing (Federal Test Procedure and Highway Fuel Economy Test) provided two other measures of fuel economy as well as exhaust emissions. Dynamometer horsepower tests were performed and the lubricating properties of each oil were determined by analyzing oil samples taken from the test vehicles at regular intervals. Major findings were: (1) On-the-road testing revealed that a low viscosity oil produced a fuel economy increase of 3.0%, a fluid friction modified oil produced a fuel economy increase of 2.7%; the remaining test oils did not produce any significant changes in fuel economy. (2) Laboratory testing revealed that the low viscosity oil produced a fuel economy improvement of 5.9%, one fluid friction modified oil produced a fuel economy increase averaging 5.6%; a solid-friction modified oil produced a fuel economy increase of 8.3%; the other fluid friction modified oil did not produce any significant fuel economy changes. (3) Testing for oil economy and lubricant properties also indicated no significant deterioration or differences among the oils. 821249. Development of a fully automatic viscometer for oil rheology in a broad range of shear rates. G. Roussel and J. du Parquet, TOTAL - Com- pagnie Française de Raffinage, Research Center, Harf leur (France). A completely automatic high shear rate rotary viscometer has been developed. Continuous variation of speed allows instantaneous plotting of viscosity versus shear rate by means of a desk computer. Due to the short response time of the temperature control and to the optimum geometry of the viscometer, thermal corrections are not necessary over the whole range of viscosity. The instrument can deliver flow curves in fifteen minutes with an oil sample of 10 millilitres in the following test conditions: temperatures from 80 to 150°C, shear rates from 5 . 104 s_1 to 1.2 . 106 s-1. The repeatability of the apparatus is 2 to 3%. 821250. Oil film thickness in a bearing of a fired engine. Part II: the bearing as a capacitor. R. C. Craig, W. H. King, Jr., and J. K. Appeldoorn, Exxon Research and Engineering Company. A new technique has been developed to measure the actual oil film thickness in a fired engine bearing over the complete engine cycle. It involves isolating the bearing electrically from the rest of the engine, imposing a high-frequency AC voltage, and measuring the capaci- tance of the entire bearing. From this, the oil film thickness can be determined as a continuous function of time. The precision of the new technique is excellent and is sensitive enough to detect cycle-to-cycle variations in peak pressure, as well as such conditions as engine knock and misfire. The effect of engine load and speed and of oil viscosity is clearly noted. The overall conclusion from this work is that this technique is probably the best method currently available for determining the load carrying ability of engine oils in fired engines.

Automotive fuels are reviewed from the perspective of the declining petroleum demand and prices of 1982. For the next 20 years, petroleum will remain the predominant source of automotive fuels worldwide; U.S. petroleum imports and their vulnerability to interruptions will be lower than in the late 1970's. The U.S. production of natural gas may exceed that of petroleum and will be supplemented by relatively secure imports. Barring major disruptions in the Middle East, or a strong OPEC, the rate of U.S. petroleum price increases will match or slightly exceed that of inflation. Conse- quently, in the near future fuels from coal, oil shale or biomass will be unattractive for private investment in the U.S. under free-market economics. This pessimistic forecast may not apply to methanol because of the high efficiency of methanol engines and the potential for lower methanol costs. However, coordination of methanol and methanol-vehicle production and dis- tribution rates are problems. 821252. (SP-526) Evaluation of automotive crankcase lubricants by differential scanning calorimetry. S. M. Hsu, A. L. Cummings, and D. B. Clark, Materials Chemistry Div., National Bureau of Standards, Washington, DC. A laboratory bench test has been developed to examine the oxidation stability of crankcase lubricants using a high pressure power-compensation differential scanning calo- rimeter (DSC). Oxidation induction time measured at 175°C and 3.62 MPa (525 psia) oxygen pressure was used to rank eight ASTM sequence HID engine test stand reference oils. The DSC result correlated with the viscosity increase tendencies of the reference oils as determined by the engine tests. The new test method is rapid and requires only microliter sample size for testing with good precision. The method employs a mixture of soluble metal catalysts consisting of lead, iron, copper, manganese, and tin (82%, 7%, 4%, 3.5%, 3.5%) together with a synthetic oxidized high-boiling gasoline fraction. This combination was found necessary to simulate some of the engine conditions and chemistry. Laboratory tests which could assess the performance of lubricants in engines have long been sought. Such tests could be used by lubricant developers to screen lubricants and lubricant formulations, to aid development of products and processes, and to minimize the expenses for 162</page><page sequence="144">engine tests. This paper reports the development of a differential scanning calorimeter test method to evaluate the oxidation stability of lubricants under the ASTM Sequence HID engine test conditions. 821256. Analytic process to develop a local truck driving cycle. George Ç. H. Perkins, Jr., Consultant. Driving cycles have been used in Federal Test Procedures to establish fuel economy and emissions characteristics for automobiles. Reasonable driving cycles for trucks and buses have been more difficult to establish because of the great variety of uses which these vehicles experience. The truck cycle has been divided into three different use categories~the local cycle, the short haul cycle, and the highway cycle. Only recently, has actual field data been obtained, and this paper proposes a method of utilizing this data to develop a more realistic local cycle than those previously proposed. 821257. Testing for improved truck and bus fuel economy. Henry E. Seiff, Voluntary Truck and Bus Fuel Economy Program, U.S. Department of Trans- portation, Current Affiliation: The Motor Ve- hicle Manufacturers Association. The TMC/SAE Type I and Type II tests were developed jointly by the SAE and the American Trucking Asso- ciations' Maintenance Council (TMC) with sponsorship from the Voluntary Truck and Bus Fuel Economy Program. The tests allow truck and bus operators and others to evaluate products and designs for fuel economy using a drive cycle of their own choosing. To encourage the use of this procedure and provide unbiased infor- mation to the industry, the Voluntary Program has begun a series of "New Energy Concepts Tests" to evaluate products and ideas. The first two series of New Energy Concepts Tests were run at the Transportation Research Center of Ohio in the Fall of 1981 and the Spring of 1982. Four aerodynamic devices, a diesel fuel heater and radiator shutters were evaluated to determine their effect on the fuel economy of medium and heavy-duty trucks. This paper reports on these six tests. In addition it recommends a succinct standardized reporting procedure for consid- eration by users of the Type II procedure in reporting their results in a uniform and readable manner. The paper recommends that one or more organizations collect and make available all data (which can be made public) from the Type I and II tests. Finally the paper documents the repeatability of the test procedure and discusses plans to investigate this issue further. SAE Trans., Vol . 91 821258. An analysis of commercial vehicle speed control concepts. John F. Weiss and Claude M. Ligon, AMAF Transportation Systems Div., AMAF Industries, Inc., Columbia, MD.; Claude Travis, Independent Fleet Consultant.; and Henry Seiff, NHTSA Office of Heavy Duty Vehicle Re- search. 821260 Speed control concepts are devices, designs, or techniques which, when used separately or in combination, reduce a vehicle's road speed to a more fuel-efficient level. The study encompassed five general categories of speed control: engine speed governors/power train numerical ratios, road speed governors, tachographs/trip recorders, cruise controls, and driver training and motivation programs. Although fleet operating experience has dem- onstrated that the proper use of speed control can save fuel and have other beneficial side effects, three factors affect the development of speed control programs: driver resistance, management commitment, and operational difficulties. While speed control programs can vary, companies with successful programs thoroughly inves- tigate the market, train and motivate their drivers, and implement the program slowly with careful monitoring and structured tests.

Frequency response methods are applied in developing an understanding of the influence of design parameters on the directional performance of commercial vehicle com- binations employing full trailers. Transfer functions are used to describe the contributions of full trailers, trucks, and tractor-semitrailers to the rearward amplification between the lateral accelerations of the towing and last units in truck-full trailers, doubles, and triples combi- nations. These transfer functions show how forward velocity, distances from pintle hitches to center-of-gravity locations, and cornering coefficients influence rearward amplification.

MacAdam, The University of Michigan, Transportation Research Institute. A class of heavy truck vehicles, characterized primarily by high centers of gravity, was studied using analysis and computer simulation to identify and understand the relationship between directional and roll stability of such vehicles during steady turning maneuvers. Findings of the computer-based study suggest: (1) directional instability (yaw divergence) is possible for such vehicles during steady turning while operating at elevated speeds on horizontal road surfaces, (2) yaw divergence will lead to rollover in the absence of corrective steering action and/or reduced speed, and (3) the primary mechanism responsible for precipitating yaw divergent behavior in such vehicles is the nonlinear sensitivity of truck tire cornering stiffness to vertical load acting in combination with typical heavy truck fore/aft roll stiffness distribu- tions. In addition, the influences of roadway supereleva- tion and driver steering control as contributors to vehicle stabilization are examined and discussed.

Telford, Warn Industries, Portland, Oregon. Ford 1983V2 Ranger/Bronco II 4 X 4 light trucks will be available with optional automatic locking hubs manu- factured by Warn Industries. The design has been developed with Ford Light Truck Engineering to provide superior reliability, in addition to improved fuel economy and customer convenience which are inherent in the design. This paper traces the evolution from conception to production of the Warn Industries' proprietary sliding clutch ring (referred to as SCR) automatic locking hub. This automatic locking hub is similar in function to the well accepted, and proven, manual hub lock used as standard equipment on all Ford 4x4 light trucks. However, when the transfer case is placed in four-wheel drive, these hubs automatically engage the front wheels with the driving axle. Getting out of the vehicle to manually turn a dial on each of the hubs to either engage or disengage the front driving axle is not required. In two-wheel drive when the hubs disengage, all front drivetrain components are stationary, thereby providing improved fuel economy and eliminating unnecessary drag and wear on the front axle, drive shaft and transfer case components. In other competitive designs, however, some of the drivetrain components continue to rotate in two-wheel drive. Because the automatic locking hubs offer greater operating convenience, they reduce the amount of time the hubs are locked - a significant step toward improved fuel economy. 821263. The importance of maintaining air brake ad- justment. Richard W. Radliński, National High- way Traffic Safety Administration, East Liberty, OH.; and Sidney F. Williams and John M. Machey, National Highway Traffic Safety Ad- ministration, Washington, DC. Air brake adjustment is a critical factor in achieving optimum system performance. Brake chamber stroke must be minimized if maximum brake torque is to be achieved. A significant loss of brake torque occurs over what is considered to be the acceptable brake adjustment range particularly if the brake is hot. A large number of air braked vehicles on the road have brakes out of adjustment or have brakes considered to be in adjustment that are operating at a reduced effectiveness level. Better ad- justment maintenance would improve truck safety. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821264. Test surface curvature reduction factor for truck tire rolling resistance. John R. Luchini, Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Findlay, OH. This paper presents a method for converting truck tire rolling resistance data obtained on a roadwheel in accordance with SAE J 1379 to its equivalent rolling resistance on a flat surface. The assumptions used in the derivation presented in the Appendix are appropriate for truck tires. However, the resulting factor is identical with the factor in current use for passenger car tire rolling resistance. Data is present from twelve tires tested on both flat and curved surfaces. The data supports the correction factor within about 1%. 821265. Interiaboratory roiling resistance testing - high- way truck and bus tires. J. W. O'Neal, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH.; C. A. Brunot, The BF Goodrich Co., Akron, OH.; A. D. Wanstedt, The Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Findlay, OH.; and T. C. Warholic, The General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. A cooperative round robin test program was initiated among various test facilities in order to validate the procedure specified in the proposed SAE Recommended Practice for the measurement of rolling resistance of highway truck and bus tires. After suitable corrections were made for test drum size and for ambient temper- ature, the data from all the facilities were found to be clustered about the mean. Where multiple runs were made by a single facility, run to run variability was examined and found to be quite low. It was concluded that consistent rolling resistance data on highway truck and bus tires can be obtained on a variety of indoor test equipment. The conclusions apply if the procedures in the SAE Recommended Practice J 1379 and accompanying Information Report J 1380 are followed, and suitable correction factors are used. 821266. Correlation of truck tire rolling resistance as derived from fuel economy and laboratory tests. R. E. Knight, Radial Truck Tire Engineering, The Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Akron, OH. Tests were conducted with two tractor-trailers on an 8-mile track to determine effects of tire parameters on fuel economy. Four- tire samples of tires used on the trucks were laboratory tested to determine rolling resistance values. Laboratory data were corrected to fuel economy test conditions and compared with tire rolling resistance data extracted mathematically from fuel economy tests. Good agreement was obtained - a correlation factor of 0.957. The factor relating comparative change in meas- ured laboratory tire rolling resistance to change in truck fuel economy was determined for selected tires. A method is presented for converting laboratory rolling resistance data to road conditions for use in truck performance calculations. 821267. Effect of tire rolling loss on fuel consumption of trucks. D. J. Schuring, Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Central Research Laboratories, Akron, OH.; and J. S. Redfield, Shell Offshore Inc., New Orleans, LA. A linear relation between tire rolling loss and fuel consumption is derived experimentally for a tractor-trailer operated at constant speed. The relation is used to 164</page><page sequence="146">investígate tire related fuel consumption and general effects of tire rolling loss changes. The results are compared with corresponding data of passenger cars. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821268. Rolling resistance measurements of new and retreaded truck tires. Samuel K. Clark and Timothy C. Dodge, University of Michigan. Rolling resistance measurements were made on a sample of twenty-four retreaded and four new truck tires spanning a variety of constructions, tread patterns and tread depths. Examination of the results showed some relationship between three construction features and the resulting rolling resistance values. These are (a) Radial or bias carcass construction, (b) Tread pattern, and (c) Tread depth. The latter two characteristics can over-ride radial or bias construction effects. The effect of tread compound could not be analyzed in this limited test program. Good quality retreaded truck tires can exhibit comparable rolling resistance with new truck tires. 821269. Additives and their effects on truck tires and rims. William D. Noll and Charles M. Scarton, Firestone Steel Products Co. This paper examines the service environment of the truck tire and rim assembly, then describes a simplified approach to duplicate this environment in the laboratory. The objective of this laboratory procedure is to evaluate tire lubricants, balancers, and sealants and to determine their potential effects on truck tires and rims. The results of these tests indicate that this method provides a suitable means to compare the service performance of additives. Of 23 commercially available additives tested, only a few can be considered acceptable for the tire and rim assembly. 821270. Heavy truck occupant crash protection - a plan for investigating ways to improve it. Robert M. Clarke, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.; and Joseph Mergel, U.S. Dept. of Transportation, Transportation Systems Center. The concept of providing more than minimum levels of crash protection to heavy truck occupants has received comparatively limited research and engineering attention. This appears to be due, in part, to the supposition that management of crash-induced kinetic energy is neither practical nor possible due to the relatively large mass and typically high travel of speeds of heavy trucks. This view is reinforced by the fact that proportionally few heavy truck accidents are fatal to their occupants, and many that are fatal are spectacularly catastrophic. Accordingly, heavy truck safety improvement efforts have historically em- phasized accident prevention while leaving crash miti- gation subjects relatively unaddressed. This paper discusses reasons why that assumption may not be valid. It also outlines a research program whose overall objective is the identification and development of incremental improvements to heavy truck cab compo- 821276 nents and structures which have the greatest possibility of being both practical and effective-namely improvements whose effect can be realized in non-catastrophic accidents that are nevertheless fatal to the truck occupant. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821271. Rollover, ejection, and the potential effectiveness of restraints in heavy-truck occupant fatalities. Kenneth L. Campbell, Transportation Research Institute, The Univ. of Michigan. Rollover and ejection are associated with heavy-truck occupant fatalities almost twice as frequently as with passenger-car occupant fatalities. A panel reviewed 41 in-depth cases to assess the possible effectiveness of restraint use and the contribution of rollover and ejection to the fatal injuries. The panel's responses indicated that belt use was expected to be particularly effective in preventing fatalities resulting from occupant ejection. A review of the proportion of ejections by model year indicated that 1972 model year and newer heavy trucks have about 20 percent fewer ejections than pre- 1972 heavy trucks. Ejection through the doors was reduced by 80 percent. This difference seems to reflect the effectiveness of FMVSS 206, which required stronger door latches. 821272. Advance in cranking motors - a new" design concept. A. H. Seilly and W. R. Ridel, Lucas CAV Limited. This paper reviews probably the world's most advanced truck cranking motors in production today. Their design has taken many years to develop and reach the high technical performance and reliability they now achieve. Designed to meet the most arduous conditions and including many novel features to be proof against every conceivable malfunction, they are very compact and robust. A unit weighing 20 Kg and 130mm diameter by 333mm long from the flange cranks engines up to 15 litres, and a unit weighing 31 Kg and 152mm diameter by 426mm long from the flange cranks engines up to 25 litres under extreme climatic conditions. 821275. Collision protection for small transit buses. Jack E. Gieck, Central Research Laboratories, The Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.; Ernie A. Miller, Metro Regional Transit Authority, Akron, OH.; and Robert L. McClelland, Firestone Industrial Products Co. This paper reports the results of a survey analyzing the accident experience of small transit vehicles compared with that of larger coaches; and also describes the development and testing of an energy absorbing bumper designed for such vehicles in the 4,000-14,000 lb (1800- 6400 kg) weight range. 821276. The bus - its part in the journey. Eric J. Woodcock, Leyland Vehicles Limited. In order to react to continuing changes in the nature of journeys made using urban buses, it is suggested that bus design should be viewed in the context of the whole journey. Each journey has a number of features; including 165</page><page sequence="147">821276 the person who makes it, its purpose, the stages of the journey, the common elements of each stage, and the custom and practice it reflects. Examples are taken to show how each feature affects bus design, and a number of areas for significant design innovation are identified. 821277. The Allison Transmission Output Retarder. S. F. Spurlin and J. L. Trotter, Detroit Diesel Allison, Division of General Motors Corporation. Worldwide interest in secondary braking systems on buses and trucks is increasing. The causes of this interest are the needs to extend service brake life and to help meet upgraded European braking standards. To satisfy this demand, Detroit Diesel Allison has developed an integral output retarder for the Allison MT600 transmission with future adaptability to the V730 and HT740 transmissions. This retarder provides sustained high power absorption at high output speeds as well as braking capability down to very low output speeds. The unique configuration of the Allison retarder includes both friction clutch and hydraulic retardation. Development of the retarder required combining these two methods through use of a control system which provides quick response leading to smooth braking and suitable operator controllability. 821278. • Transit bus remanufacturing for a second life . . . analysis and results. P. K. Varma, The Blitz Corp. Bus remanufacturing has grown into a nationally rec- ognized field in transit industry. Complete restoration of critical structural components is very important for its sound growth. Structural parts are examined to reveal their deterioration in unexposed areas. Road call data is compared to analyze the performance of remanufactured buses. Development of a positive scope of work and quantification of contractor evaluation criteria are dis- cussed. 821283. The influence of structural mobility on truck interior noise. T. C. Tecco, Truck Group Engi- neering, International Harvester Co., Fort Wayne, IN. A digital signal processing method is employed to generate mobility functions and acoustic transfer func- tions. The acoustic transfer function is defined as the sound pressure level per unit force at the cab mount. Peaks in the driving point mobility function, measured at the cab mount locations, correlate with peaks in the acoustic transfer function. These functions were evaluated in the frequency range 50-1000 Hz where truck interior noise is strongly influenced by structural vibration. Reducing the mobility leads to a reduction in the acoustic, transfer function. A method for evaluating bracket structural changes was determined and some general design guidelines established for the reduction of truck interior noise. 821284. A summary of NASA Dryden's truck aerodynamic research. Edwin J. Saltzman, NASA Ames Research Center, Dry den Flight Research Fa- cility, Edwards, CA. A combination of subscale wind tunnel model tests and full-scale coast-down and highway fuel consumption tests have been conducted on baseline and low-drag tractor- trailer configurations. Fuel savings calculated for the low-drag configuration, based on the model drag data or the full-scale drag data, correlate quite well with fuel savings obtained from over-the-road tests at highway speeds. Subscale drag tests for flow-vane and boattail devices provided drag reductions of about 48 percent and 15 percent, respectively, for bus- or motor-home-type vehicles. Full-scale boattail drag data are also presented. 821285. The wind tunnel testing of heavy trucks to reduce fuel consumption. Kevin R. Cooper, The Na- tional Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Canada. Contemporary wind tunnel test techniques used to determine the aerodynamic drag of model trucks are reviewed. The effect of drag coefficient changes are evaluated in terms of reductions in fuel consumption and several comparisons are made between wind tunnel predictions and road measurement. The drag reductions and fuel consumption reductions presently available and those expected from future aerodynamic modifications are examined, based on wind tunnel experience. SAE Trans ., Vol . 91 821286. Aspects of over-the-road testing of truck aero- dynamic drag reducing devices. Frank T. Buck- ley, Jr., Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Maryland, College Park, MD. The problem of evaluating the fuel savings effectiveness of a truck aerodynamic drag reducing device in an over- the-road test is considered. The sensitivity of a vehicle's fuel consumption rate to factors other than the drag reduction produced by a device is discussed to illustrate potential sources of error. Evaluations of typical per- formances of several different drag reducing designs demonstrate how effectiveness varies as a function of the design of a device and the short-term and the long-term wind conditions under which it operates. Current SAE over-the-road test procedures are discussed in terms of the correlation between the test result and the probable long-term final savings produced by a device. Results from several fleet experiments are reviewed to illustrate differences in fuel savings results as functions of the drag reduction potential of the vehicle, the design of the device, the test conditions, the test technique employed, and the method of data interpretation. Guidelines for the mean- ingful evaluation of the effectiveness of a drag reducing device are presented. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821340. Human factors approach in certification flight test. J. J. Speyer and A. Fort, Flight Division, 166</page><page sequence="148">Airbus Industrie. The Human factor is receiving more active concern in both engineering and design as well as in flight test and certification. This paper discusses AIRBUS INDUS- TRIE'S human factors involvement in the latter areas with the objective of checking functional effectiveness and human welfare. The crew complement question prompted the consideration of workload, studies for this critical variable in man-machine interaction are also important for the design of the aircraft and associated procedures. AIRBUS INDUSTRIE has developed workload study methods based on the input load (taskload), operator effort (workload) and output result (performance). SAE Trans., Vol . 91 821341. NGT sub-scale flight demonstrator - a cost- effective approach to aircraft development. G. Rosenthal, Advanced Aircraft, Fairchild Re- public Co. Sub-scale flight demonstrators have been used in the past to verify overall conceptual design in a limited quanti- tative manner. With the advent of small, reliable turbojet units, lightweight moldless fiberglass, graphite and foam plastic composite construction, and effective, compact flight test instrumentation, it is now possible to conduct early, low-cost flight test programs to validate a concept and save time and considerable flight test expense of the later full-scale development program. Fairchild Republic Company (FRC), in the course of developing its Next Generation Trainer (NGT) config- uration, contracted the services of Ames Industrial Corp. to produce a flight demonstrator, with the assistance of Rutan Aircraft Factory and Flight Systems, Inc., to provide design, flight test and instrumentation services. The approach was highly successful in terms of cost, schedule and results. The overall program required approximately the same cost and schedule to accomplish as would a wind tunnel test program using a complex powered wind tunnel model. Comprehensive results were obtained under representative dynamic flight conditions that could not be accurately simulated in a wind tunnel. The results of the flying qualities tests provided close correlation with analytical estimates. In particular, natural stall warning was exhibited, as well as excellent stall characteristics, and satisfactory operation in strong crosswinds during takeoff and landing. Considerable reduction in program cost and in technical and schedule risk of a full-scale NGT development program is expected as a result of the demonstrator program. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821342. A Shuttle Derived Vehicle launch system. J. Robert Tewell, David N. Buell, and Elwood S. Ewing, Martin Marietta Aerospace, Michoud Div., New Orleans, LA. This paper describes a Shuttle Derived Vehicle (SDV) launch system presently being studied for the NASA by Martin Marietta Aerospace which capitalizes on existing Shuttle hardware elements to provide increased accom- 821346 modations for payload weight, payload volume, or both. The SDV configuration utilizes the existing solid rocket boosters, external tank and the space shuttle main engines but replaces the manned orbiter with an unmanned, remotely controlled cargo carrier. This cargo carrier substitution more than doubles the performance capa- bility of the orbiter system and is realistically achievable for minimal cost. The advantages of the SDV are presented in terms of performance and economics. Based on these considerations, it is concluded that an unmanned SDV offers a most attractive complement to the present Space Transportation System. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821345. Advanced aluminum alloy for transport aircraft -why and what are the benefits. I. F. Sakata, Lockheed-California Co. Highlights of a study conducted by Lockheed for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are presented. The potential benefits are based on realistic advanced aluminum alloy property goals considering powder metallurgy (PM) and ingot metallurgy (IM) technologies. The property goals were established in consultation with the Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa) to maximize aircraft systems effectiveness of a 1990 in-service (IOC) transport aircraft. The performance and economic benefits of incorporating advanced alloys in these future advanced technology transport aircraft are summarized. Key issues requiring attention in an ad- vanced aluminum alloy and applications technology development are presented. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821346. Design of an aerobatic aircraft wing using advanced composite materials. Hans D. Neubert, H. D. Neubert &amp; Associates, Inc., Anaheim, CA.; and Leo E. Loudenslager, 1980-1981 World Aerobatic Champion, 1975, 1976, 1977,» 1978, 1980, 1981 U.S. National Champion, Sussex, NJ. International competitive aerobatic flight requires a highly skilled and determined pilot combined with an aircraft capable of high maneuverability, high thrust-to-weight and low mass moment of inertia. The competitors are limited to aircraft having conventional propellers and internal combustion engines. Scoring is based on a complex Olympic style system, with maneuvers confined to 1000 meter square by 900 meter high flight envelope. Maximum accelerations experienced during a sequence of 24 maneuvers might typically include + 10g and -7g. The current state of the art in aircraft design and construction limits the pilot to attempt only those maneuvers that have a reasonable chance of successful completion, particularly those in the vertical flight regime. This paper describes a personal attempt by the authors to extend the current state-of-the-art in aerobatic aircraft design and construc- tion by the use of advanced composite materials.

A sense of "personal integrity" blocks pilot use of new information about how he thinks. Research on human performance under stress done over the past fifty years indicates increased rigidity and regression to earlier learned behavior in high stress, and in low stress a shift in attention to any domestic situation or on the job controversy which is of higher stress than that of the job at hand, all without the pilot's knowledge. Informal surveys of commercial pilot training and commercial pilot atti- tudes towards these studies indicate that the study findings directly confront learned cultural responses. Pilot and trainer reactions prevent the information from being adequately investigated or formally taught. The findings are not written into training manuals and pilots who are informally given the information do not have adequate access to the knowledge when it is needed. Until the pilot becomes able to internalize the findings of the studies he cannot anticipate how he will respond to these changes in his own thinking process, and equipment and training cannot be designed to correct for these changes. 821349. (P-114) The effects of stress on processing abstract information. Jefferson M. Koonce and Michael L. Moroze, Univ. of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA. The application of recent technological advances to aircraft cockpit display of flight information has resulted in a variety of displays lacking standardization. The level of abstractness of some flight parameters displayed, especially in head-up displays (HUDs), seems to increase pilot workload by requiring additional steps to obtain meaningful flight information. This paper questions the use of abstract symbology in flight displays, especially in vehicles in which the operators may encounter high levels of workload or mental stress, and briefly reviews an on-going research program in this area. 821352. (P-114) The pilot's role in manned space flight Warren J. North, Flight Operations Directorate, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center. In two decades we have seen growth of manned spacecraft from a 3000-pound Mercury capsule to the highly complex 200,000-pound horizontal-landing Space Shuttle. The matrix of pilot control tasks and failure recovery modes increased proportionally. Actual inflight failures that required pilot intervention ranged from manual retrofire attitude control and entry control during the last Mercury flight to emergency EVA salvage of Skylab. Unique Shuttle flying qualities and simulation re- quirements resulted from vehicle configuration constraints imposed by payload size, weight, and entry heating. Our rapidly advancing digital technology poses a critical requirement for optimum design tradeoffs during integration of the flight crews' capabilities. 821353. Man's role in shuttle/payload integration. R. L. Stempson and G. R. Morse, Lockheed Missiles and Space Company, Inc. With the continuing success of the Space Transportation System, attention is currently being focused upon the assessment of the ways in which a crewperson's capabil- ities can be utilized. The purpose of this paper is to identify candidate crew roles in space, as these roles relate to crew-payload interaction. Additionally, the advantages of the crew's presence in space will be optimized as designers increasingly depend on man's inherent capa- bilities and integrate them in the operating system. Design guidelines and considerations will be reviewed and specific advantages of utilizing man versus machine will be addressed, as well as man/machine function allocation, crew restraint systems, and displays and controls. 821354. (P-114) Space transportation system payload Flight Data File. John S. Petrek, Jr., Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. A Payload Flight Data File (FDF) is the flight checklist used by the Space Shuttle crew to operate a payload or experiment. Production of a payload FDF is a many- faceted activity which involves: task analyses, command panel topographical design and nomenclature, task sim- ulation, editing, flight crew training, flight quality printing and distribution. On-time production of a quality FDF is vital to operations planning, training development, and ultimate mission success. As payload activities evolve in scope and complexity, future FDFs development will require such automated capabilities as computer driven displays, voice input/output, and high density memory. 821356. (P-114) Manned remote work stations - machines to enhance man's space presence. C. Allan Nathan, Grumman Aerospace Corp., Bethpage, NY. The introduction of the Space Transportation System provides opportunities for improved space operations, reliability and cost effectiveness by taking advantage of man's presence. The astronaut with the proper machines can augment the Shuttle to an extent that tasks never performed in space, such as maintenance and repair of satellites and the construction of large structures can now be done. This paper addresses an evolution of one of these machines, the Maimed Remote Work Station (MRWS). The MRWS is a series of EVA platforms and crew cabins that perform roles which are common on the ground such as cherry pickers, crane turrets, emergency repair vehicles and short haul transporters. Concepts and their space applications will be delineated for near term applications in support of the Space Shuttle and future applications in support of the Space Station. Results of man-in-the-loop simulations that demonstrate man's role in maintaining satellites will also be discussed as will test results on the use of manipulators, a key element of the MRWS. These test results demonstrate man's ability to perform useful roles in space and provide a foundation for the devel- opment of more ambitious roles in the future. 168</page><page sequence="150">SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821357. (P- 114) Automation to crew procedures using multifunction display and control systems. Robert J. Spiger and Maine H. Tonkin, Boeing Aero- space Co., Seattle, WA. A multifunction display and control system (MFDCS) design concept has been developed for the Orbiter spacecraft. The system provides for automation of crew procedures, fault prioritization, incorporation of checklists and procedures into the display and control system and system flexibility in response to mission variation, in- creased experience and advancing display and control technology. Hardware included in the system includes a multifunction keyboard using programmable legend switches, a medium size flat panel display for presentation of alphanumeric information and a color CRT for the display of schematic diagrams. The access schema for the multifunction display and control system preserves the single function capability of the present set of dedicated switches while also providing for automation of many of the checklists and procedures. A basic design feature of the system is the ability to change the relative level of automation and crew interaction without modifying the system hardware or basic software operating system. 821358. Some aspects of prop-fan propulsion systems analysis. Robert E. Owens and W. Wade Fergu- son, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft Group, United Technologies Corp. Optimization of a Prop-Fan propulsion system for a Mach 0.8, 120 passenger commercial transport has shown the need for relatively high levels of overall pressure ratio, combustor exit temperature, propeller tip speed and propeller disk loading to achieve lowest fuel burn and direct operating costs. Comparison of this optimized Prop-Fan propulsion system with an equivalent tech- nology turbofan showed it to have significant mission fuel burn and direct operating cost advantages.

A two-part study was performed to design inlets for high-speed propfan installation. The first part was a parametric study to select promising inlet concepts. A wide range of inlet geometries was examined and evaluated - primarily on the basis of cruise thrust and fuel burn performance. Two inlet concepts were then chosen for more detailed design studies - one appropriate to offset engine/gearbox arrangements and the other to in-line arrangements. In the second part of this study, inlet design points were chosen to optimize the net installed thrust, and detailed design of the two inlet configurations was performed. An analytical methodology was developed to account for propfan slipstream effects, transonic flow effects, and three-dimensional geometry effects. Using this 821368 methodology, low drag cowls were designed for the two inlets. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821360.

A non-dimensional parameter is developed and data provided to estimate the required mass penalty to achieve satisfactory interior cabin noise levels for advanced propfan powered aircraft. The cabin noise criterion is 80 dBA which is representative of present-day turbofan- powered aircraft interiors and was used by NASA in a related study.

The space transportation system mixed fleet economics. Milton M. Beilock, Shuttle Orbiter Div., Rockwell International. A conservative projection of future space missions indicates that in 1985 the United States will place at least 55 payloads in orbit, and that subsequent growth in launch support needs will increase at 8 percent or more per year. As our dependence on space systems grows, so will the launch support system performance requirements grow in throw-weight capability, frequency of launch, and mission success probability. The newly developed, recoverable space transporta- tion system (STS) has demonstrated its feasibility and reusability. STS marks the next generation of space mission support capability with greater launch perform- ance, manned on-orbit support capability, and increased mission success probability. From an economic standpoint, the cost to place comparable weight payloads in orbit is shown to be less when using the STS as compared to currently operational expendable launch vehicles (ELV's). A national commit- ment has been made to fully utilize the STS capabilities to support the expanding national space mission require- ments. This commitment to STS will result in substantial mission support savings for all users. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821371. Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) - augmented fighter engine demon- stration. K. L. Linebrink, General Electric Co., Cincinnati, OH.; and R. W. Vizzini, Naval Air Propulsion Center, Trenton, NJ. This paper describes continuing development of the Navy sponsored General Electric (GE) FADEC program as demonstrated by operation of a uniquely configured F404 advanced fighter engine. This engine is a low bypass ratio, variable compressor geometry twin spool turbofan with after-burner. The General Electric FADEC, described in this paper, was programmed to operate with standard F404 control strategy and upon external command to shift to a strategy producing automatic control of a Variable Cycle Technology (VCT) feature, a Rear Variable Area Bypass Injector (RVABI). The FADEC microprocessor was also programmed to provide Failure Indication and Corrective Action (FICA) that utilizes a real time engine model to calculate and substitute replacement values (as required) for sensed values of fan speed, core speed, compressor discharge pressure, compressor inlet temper- ature, low-pressure turbine discharge temperature, and main engine fuel flow. Actuator Failure Indication and Corrective Action (AFICA) and adaptive starting fuel scheduling were also demonstrated at the General Electric Co., Lynn, Massachusetts (sea level test), and at Naval Air Propulsion Center (altitude test), Trenton, New Jersey. Emphasis of this paper will be placed on demonstrated fault tolerant capabilities of the digital control system as related to input sensors. 821373. Hybrid computer simulation in digital fuel control design. R. M. Evans, Aviation Electric Ltd- Bendix Corp. The validation process of a complex gas turbine power- plant simulation is described through direct comparison with experimental results. The steady state and transient modes of operation are substantiated. A new digital fuel control employing innovative control modes has been designed using the engine simulation. Results from actual engine tests are presented as the ultimate credibility for the model and its use as a design tool. 821374. Closed-loop engine fuel system simulation. James E. Horling and Rudy E. Harrer, Naval Air Propulsion Center, Trenton, NJ. Naval Air Propulsion Center (NAPC) personnel have implemented a hardware-in-the-loop simulation for the purpose of evaluating engine fuel system components. The objective was to establish a closed-loop test capability that would be cost-effective, easy to use and versatile. The approach uses a hybrid computer with the digital portion providing the data acquisition and display capability and the analog portion providing dynamic engine simulation. The main fuel control metered flow is used as the model driving parameter. An alternative to conventional testing is available through closed-loop testing using the hybrid computer system. The benefits to be gained include the generation of more realistic data (directly relatable to on-engine operation, a powerful trouble-shooting tool and easily automated endurance testing which provides compati- bility with advanced hydromechanical and electronic fuel controls. 821375.

Two powered-lift concepts, the tandem fan and the longitudinally-arrayed ejector, are integrated with two existing fighter aircraft, the F-14A and F-16A respec- tively, to indicate the benefits and/or penalties involved with providing STOVL capability to CTOL aircraft. It is shown that properly designed powered-lift aircraft can achieve either comparable or superior mission perform- ance relative to CTOL aircraft. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821379. Management view of productivity. Robert F. Huber, Production Publishing Company, Inc. Traditionally, management has not made serious dis- tinctions between productivity and profitability. They have measured productivity on the balance sheet. If profits are adequate to meet the desires and wants of the owners (shareholders), no productivity problems existed. 170</page><page sequence="152">Increased competition has forced managers to realize that it is no longer satisfactory to be doing things which simply "work." It is important, worth the effort, and may involve survival to know the difference between just what works and what works best and to implement the improvements.

An approach to flexible manufacturing. Ralph Patsfall and Don Hacker, General Electric Co., Aircraft Engine Business Group. Modular incremental applications of Flexible Manufac- turing Systems provide "small lots/batch" manufacturers with a strategy to improve productivity from a timetable and cash flow basis that meets his specific needs. The Aerospace Industry is one of the best examples of "small lots" manufacturing. In today's environment where flexibility is a necessity, well planned strategies, effectively executed, will determine survival and leadership in this highly competitive industry. This paper focuses on General Electric's Aircraft Engine Business Group's roadmap to apply and meld advanced technology into the in-place production base. Networking of these modernization programs provides the approach that keeps our entire manufacturing facilities - old and new - on a continual path to "Factories With a Future." Prioritized automation projects, implemented on an incremental basis, allow a pay-as-you-go tracking scheme that fulfills economic and technological objectives for modernizing our manufacturing plants. This approach allows incremental improvements within the framework of investment planning while maintaining a course of pre-eminence in technology advancements. 821384.

(P-114) The pilot and the flight management system. James R. Gannett, The Boeing Co. This paper addresses the question of whether automation is being used in the proper applications in aircraft in order to maximize aircraft capabilities and make the most of human performance capacity. It is believed that the aircraft designers, while employing automation, have given due regard to the pilot's role as operator and manager of the aircraft. There does, however, seem to be valid concern for the human element in certain aspects of the air traffic control system. 821387. (P-114) Advanced commercial cockpit concepts. W. L. Miles, J. I.

The capabilities of the new technology are enumerated along with the risks inherent in its widespread application. The objectives and philosophy of flight deck design which are considered essential to maximize the value of the new technology are presented, and a flight deck development approach designed to effectively apply these objectives and philosophical guidelines is outlined. Implementation of this development process is illustrated by recent advanced flight deck programs at Douglas Aircraft Company, in which design goals, concepts and guidelines are discussed as they apply to specific cockpit functions and, particularly, to the integration of these functions into an organized, effective work station. The conclusion is drawn that, through an interdisciplinary, systematic approach to integrating the new technology, flight deck concepts are being developed which hold high promise for the future. 821389. (P-114) The role of pilots and automation in future transport flight stations. Michael A. Com- panion and George A. Sexton, Lockheed-Geor- gia Co. The aviation community is preparing to cope with large increases in air traffic and operating costs projected during the next decade, while continuing to maintain safe operating procedures and methods. To do this the Federal Aviation Administration is updating and improving air traffic control systems, while the airframers and operators are developing methods to reduce aircraft weight, fly fuel efficient profiles, and optimize crew complements. New technologies are being exploited, efficient crew systems are being designed, and full-mission flight simulators are being constructed to test the systems in a near-real-world 171</page><page sequence="153">821389 environment. One primary concern of the designers, operators, and certifiers is the determination of the proper amount and type of automation in crew systems. Lockheed-Georgia Company, in conjunction with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, has developed a candidate conceptual design for a 1995 flight station. Research flight simulation facilities are being constructed in which that and other conceptual designs can be evaluated in a full mission context. This paper briefly describes the design and several crew systems where trade-offs can be made between increasing auto- mation and/or keeping the pilot in the loop. 821390. Development of thrust augmentation technology for the Pegasus vectored thrust engine. A. Sotheran, Rolls-Royce Ltd. Front nozzle thrust augmentation, on lift/cruise engines like the Pegasus, could greatly improve the range and load carrying capacity of Harrier/ AV-8B type VTOL aircraft and is essential for supersonic derivations. However its introduction requires several new technologies to be developed for the augmentor itself, for the augmentor and engine control system and to cater for various potentially adverse ground effects and related matters. These are the subject of a number of current research and development programmes which will lead to an engine demonstration of an advanced augmentor. SAE Trans ., Vol 91 821391. Impact protection in air transport passenger seat design. Richard G. Snyder, University of Mich- igan, Transportation Research Institute, Ann Arbor, MI. Knowledge of human impact tolerance(s) is a basic consideration in the improved design of air transport seat-restraint systems and occupant crash protection. This paper discusses biological factors which influence tol- erance, defines tolerance levels, variables including whole body and regional impact, and effect of seat and body orientation. It is concluded that the ultimate inertial forces on the occupant specified in FAR 25.561 are not based upon human tolerance considerations; that human impact survival is estimated to be four to ten times the voluntary levels cited; that improved occupant protection requires dynamically tested structural improvements; and that currently available technology such as the NASA air transport seat, or rear-facing seats, should be utilized. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821392. Recent aircraft tire thermal studies. Richard N. Dodge and Samuel K. Clark, University of Michigan. A method has been developed for calculating the internal temperature distribution in an aircraft tire while free rolling under load. The method uses an approximate stress analysis of each point in the tire as it rolls through the contact patch, and from this stress change the mechanical work done on each volume element may be obtained and converted into a heat release rate through a knowledge of material characteristics. The tire cross-section is then considered as a body with internal heat generation, and the diffusion equation is solved numerically with appro- priate boundary conditions at the wheel and runway surface. Comparisons with buried thermocouples in actual aircraft tires shows good agreement. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821393. Review of NASA antiskid braking research. John A. Tanner, NASA Langley Research Center. NASA antiskid braking system research programs are reviewed. These programs include experimental studies of four antiskid systems on the Langley Landing Loads Track, flight tests with a DC-9 airplane, and computer simulation studies. Results from these research efforts include identification of factors contributing to degraded antiskid performance under adverse weather conditions, tire tread temperature measurements during antiskid braking on dry runway surfaces, and an assessment of the accuracy of various brake pressure-torque computer models. This information should lead to the development of better antiskid systems in the future. 821395. Composite materials and déployable boom tech- nology. Karl Knapp, Astro Research Corp. Space missions planned for Shuttle launches in the next decade require déployable booms that are stronger, stiffer, and longer than those that have been flown in the past. Recent developments in déployable lattice boom tech- nology include improved designs of the Astromast using S-glass/epoxy rods as linear elements and a new folding boom called STACBEAM (Stacking Triangular Articu- lated Compact Beam) which employs graphite/epoxy rods or tubes. The design features of this new sequentially déployable truss result in improved performance and reliability compared with earlier booms. 821397.

The Insat- 1 satellite will provide a significant development in solar ray technology for synchronous orbit high power satellites. It is a three-axis stabilized spacecraft designed for seven year operation to provide communications/me- teorological service to India. Primary energy source is a single-axis, single-tracking solar array wing with solar torque offset by an opposing solar sail boom. The solar array, composed of five graphite epoxy rigid déployable panels, provides 1000 W divided between two separate power buses. 821398. Full Authority Fault Tolerant Electronic Engine Control systems for advanced high performance engines (FAFTEEC). M. E. McGlone, R. J. Miller, and W. J.

Over the past three decades gas turbine engine technology 172</page><page sequence="154">for high performance, multi-mission aircraft has pro- gressed from hydromechanical designs to full authority digital electronic control systems. Future weapon systems will require propulsion controls that are highly integrated with the flight control, and since the engine control then becomes part of the flight control system, safety will require fault tolerant capabilities. Realizing this, the Air Force sponsored the Full Authority Fault Tolerant Electronic Engine Control (FAFTEEC) Program to identify the basic redundancy requirements in the design architecture of control systems that provide very high levels of mission reliability. 821399. Status of fiberoptics technology for propulsion control systems. Robert J. Baumbick, NASA Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH. Because of optics' inherent immunity to electromagnetic noise it offers considerable promise in improving the reliability of propulsion control systems. Future engine systems will be electronically controlled with no hydro- mechanical backup. The electronic computer will have to be isolated from electromagnetic noise by heavy shielding of metallic transmission lines. Fiberoptic data transmis- sion and passive optical sensors can insure more complete isolation of the computer from electromagnetic distur- bances and thereby produce a more reliable control system. This paper discusses work being done by NASA Lewis Research Center in the area of optical sensors and optically controlled actuators for use in airbreathing engine control systems. The environmental conditions in which the aircraft will operate, require the fiberoptic cables and optical connectors to perform reliably at temperatures over the -55°C to 260°C range. The status of fiberoptics technology for operation in this environment is reviewed. 821400. Developments in performance monitoring and diagnostics in aircraft turbine engines. Carolyn Smith and Ronald DeHoff, Systems Control Technology, Inc.; and Martin Huffman, Air Force Wright Aeronautical Laboratories/POTC. Automated performance monitoring of aircraft turbine engines can be characterized as a three phase process which includes data acquisition, data processing, and maintenance information management. With recent re- search and development activities in these areas, more sophisticated methods for performing these tasks have been developed. Results show promise for improving the reliability, efficiency and utility of automated perform- ance monitoring and diagnostic systems. In order to achieve a reliability centered Maintenance (RCM) policy for aircraft engines in the Air Force, methods and systems have been developed which monitor the health of modern propulsion systems. Information derived from inflight collected data is analyzed and reduced to meaningful engine health indicators at the level of the engine module. This information, in concert with other engine data and maintenance information must be 821405 integrated and made available to maintenance decision makers in a fashion which supports RCM. The per- formance monitoring/diagnostic process can be char- acterized as a three step process which includes data acquisition, data processing and maintenance information management. Each step is unique and critical to the success of the overall maintenance policy. 821401. Development of a compact real-time turbofan engine dynamic simulation. Michael W. French, Aircraft Engine, Business Group, General Elec- tric Co. Recent developments in the area of digital propulsion controls have precipitated requirements for compact real-time dynamic engine simulations. This paper de- scribes the analytical development and experimental validation of a full range, non-linear model of the F404-GE-400 after-burning turbofan engine. Unique approaches were used to obtain a highly compact model which is capable of being operated in an engine mounted airborne digital computer. The model served as a signal source in a failure protection scheme, providing an unusual basis for model validation. Highlights of the very successful broad ranging validation and use of this model are provided. 821402. Microcomputer brings digital power to the small aircraft gas turbine. F. C. Zuliani and G. N. Kline, United Technologies Hamilton Standard, Windsor Locks, Connecticut. A new digital microprocessor based electronic control system has been developed and flight tested for small gas turbine engine applications. This paper addresses the Hamilton Standard Multi-Application Control System (MACS) which marries a unique blend of computing power from a modern day digital microprocessor along with the reliability of a hydromechanical control unit, all in a cost effective package geared for the small gas turbine engine arena. The design concept allowed a basic control system to be applied to several engine programs with only minor modifications required to the electronic and hydromechanical portions of the system. These engine programs include turbofan, turboprop and turboshaft applications. To-date, all three variations of the system have been produced and successfully tested and are presently being introduced into production. 821405. (P-l 14) Advancements in control/display systems for Army helicopters. Francis J. Bick, U.S. Army. A new generation of Army helicopter crew station is being developed today to meet the challenges of missions required by Army Aviation. The scout mission exemplifies the demands that can be placed upon the aircraft and crew. Scout missions require nap-of-the-earth (NOE) flight during day, night, and adverse weather conditions. Such a requirement demands the highest degree of compatibility between aircraft systems and crew. To meet this challenge, the US Army is currently developing an improved scout helicopter called the Army Helicopter 173</page><page sequence="155">821405 Improvement Program (AHIP). Several enhancements and innovations in crew station design are an integral part of the program. Improvements in the AHIP control/display system reduce head-down cockpit activities allowing more time for head-up flight of the aircraft; especially important during NOE flight. This paper describes human factors engineering enhancements of the AHIP crew station and includes a detailed discussion of the controls and displays system. The discussion also describes the first time utilization of multifunction displays (MFD's) for dis- playing warning/caution/advisory signals. During the last decade Army Aviation research has indicated that significant improvements are necessary in crew station design to keep pace with advancements in battlefield technology. These improvements have been incrementally made to aircraft already in the inventory and under contract development. Several older aircraft crew stations are currently being modified and updated to meet today's mission requirements. This paper will address several of the helicopter crew station advance- ments that have been made and continue to be made to improve the pilot/copilot interface and to reduce crew workload. This paper will describe the full scale devel- opment effort on the AHIP Scout Observation Helicopter, which represents the most recent developments in crew station design. 821407. (P- 114) Human factors considerations in the development of a voice warning system for helicopters. C. M. Bertone, Human Factors Engineering, Sikorsky Aircraft. Future variants of the S-76 will have the most advanced cockpit of any commercial helicopter in the industry. Besides the addition of CRT's for the display of infor- mation, Sikorsky decided to install a voice warning system to do away with the various tones and beeps in the present system but to permit the pilot to fly "Heads-up" for longer periods and to relieve him from the task of monitoring the caution warning panel. The human factors group at Sikorsky conducted a systematic series of experiments in order to determine the messages, their priority, and the type of voice to be utilized in this system. This paper described the procedure from pilot interviews through the testing of various voices for quality, understandability to actual installation and flight testing. 821408. (P-114) Digital Moving Map Display. Donald DeMyer, Lear Siegler, Inc./Instrument Div., Grand Rapids, MI. Pilots have always needed a way to relate their aircraft state to the real world: "Where am I"? "Where am I going"? "How do I get there"? The translational media has been "paper maps" showing earth coordinates and various projection types with mission significant features such as NAV Aids, terrain information, and cultural details. In todays dynamic cockpit environment, the reading of a latitude-longitude display and finding that position on a map is not conducive to rapid "situational awareness". One answer is an electronic, graphic display of map information relative to the aircraft. The work was done under the sponsorship of the Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory to demonstrate the basic feasibility of the Digital Moving Map Display for the modern cockpit. Within the effort, the effect of color, declutter, scaling (zoom), map orientation (north-up and track-up), and the quantification of digital storage and processing requirements has been evaluated. This paper summarizes the results. 821409. (P-114) The pilot's role in the automated ATC System. W. B. Cotton, Air Line Pilots Asso- ciation. The conversion from the labor-intensive air traffic control system of today to the virtually completely automated system of tomorrow introduces many benefits, but there are also potential hazards. A concept - "distributed monitoring" - is introduced which will make this tran- sition safer and more efficient. Through this concept, the pilot will play a key role in his operation within the ATC system aided by an on-board cockpit display of traffic information. 821410. (P-l 14) Automation of the flight path - the pilot's role. J. G. Oliver, M. R. Hoagland, and G. J. Terhune, All Weather Flying Committee, Air Line Pilots Association. ALPA takes the position that automation of flight-critical systems is acceptable only when the pilot is provided with sufficient information to evaluate the product of the automated process and has the ability to assume manual control of that process. Automatic landing systems are cited as an example of automation without adequate information. 821412. (P-114) Color CRT displays - a new standard for flight instrumentation?D. W. Istwan, Air Line Pilots Association. Performance specifications for aircraft instrumentation utilizing color CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) displays should be based upon recognized human factors and cockpit environmental requirements. The complexity of these requirements can result in the development of hardware with specifications derived from a deficient human factors data base. The consequences are potentially inadequate performance under demanding environmental conditions or increased cost and reduced life penalties resulting from deficient or overly conservative specifications. Depend- ence on this new technology for information critical to flight safety should be tempered with redundant conven- tional instrumentation until performance standardization is achieved. SAE Trans ., Vol . 91 821413. (P-114) Information transfer and the changing role of the pilot. G. L. Babcock, W. W. Ed- munds, Jr., and R. B. Stone, Air Line Pilots Association. This paper discusses information transfer as it relates to 174</page><page sequence="156">the man-machine interface of future air transports. The term "information transfer" is defined and related to actual incidents and accidents. Finally, a course of action is proposed to design appropriate roles for the crew and automatics so that optimum information transfer takes place. 821414. (P-114) Training for automatics. R. £. Norman, Jr., Air Line Pilots Association. This paper discusses improved concepts which will be required for training and demonstration of performance with new and evolving automated aircraft systems. Computerbased training devices, as well as procedures trainers, will be used to teach the required skills and procedures. Proper training will be demonstrated by simulated performance, primarily through the use of Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT) scenarios. 821415. How the Air Force plans and executes composites roadmaps. Tobey Cordell, AFWAL Materials Lab. Faced with the problem of managing a complex array of research, development, manufacturing technology and systems support programs, the Air Force Wright Aero- nautical Laboratories have turned to the use of "road- maps." This paper highlights how these roadmaps are used in both the planning and execution of the labora- tories' in-house and contractual programs. Specifically, this paper deals with the use of roadmaps to implement the laboratories' programs in composite materials. 821418. Manufacturing methods for composite graphite hole generation. J. P. Chanani and J. A. Boldt, Aircraft Div., Northrop Corp. The generation of holes in graphite/epoxy composite materials for the installation of thousands of fasteners is one of the costliest operations in the production of high-performance aircraft. The increasing use of com- posite materials in aircraft structures has made the development of lower cost manufacturing methods im- perative. This paper describes the manufacturing methods, cutting tools, feed rates and speeds developed for reducing the costs of generating high quality holes in composite graphite/epoxy materials. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821419. The electric orbiter. W. L. Swingle and J. T. Edge, NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX. The current design base of the Space Shuttle Orbiter employs hydraulic actuation for control of aerosurfaces, engine thrust, engine thrust vector, brakes, and landing gear functions. As early as 1972, electromechanical actuation (EMA) was considered as an alternative system. As a result of continued advances in technology devel- opment, studies now indicate that EMA is a more attractive alternative. Major advantages are weight re- duction, striking improvement in energy efficiency, easier maintenance, and a cleaner vehicle. The results of a system study advocating EMA for the 821422 Orbiter are presented. Emphasis is placed on a clear understanding of the relationships between mission requirements and design parameters. EMA system energy requirements are compared with those of the existing hydraulic system. Detailed discussion of the synthesized EMA system is limited to the aerosurface actuators. The design is consistent with the Orbiter "fail operational," "fail safe" redundancy requirement. Finally, an assess- ment summary of EMA for Orbiter is made. 821420. Space Shuttle Environmental and Life Support System (ECLSS). Joseph E. Swider, Jr. and Richard Galluccio, Hamilton Standard Div., United Technologies Corp. The Space Shuttle Orbiter Environmental Control and Life Support System (EC/LSS) functions to provide life support for the Shuttle Orbiter crew members and active cooling for Shuttle Orbiter equipment and payloads. This paper describes four of the major subsystems of the Shuttle Orbiter EC/LSS and reviews the performance of these systems through the first three Space Shuttle flights. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821421. Validation of the KC-10 refueling boom digital control system. Leonard G. Bekemeyer, Douglas Aircraft Company, McDonnell Douglas Cor- poration, Long Beach, California. The refueling boom on the KC-10 tanker is controlled by a digital fly-by-wire system. Use of a three-level verifi- cation procedure was begun early in the development cycle to detect design and coding errors. The software code was exercised in a hardware/software interface which became more complete with each succeeding level. The supplier's validation facility was used to provide first-level code checks. A multipurpose man-in-loop simulator which contained most of the flight-type oper- ator's station components was used for second-level checks. The KC-10 ground and flight test activities provided the final verification. Inservice history (nearing two years) indicates a completely successful validation program. 821422. Robotic testing for digital systems. Hussein M. Youssef, Lockheed-California Co. The use of digital compuers in flight control and avionics systems requires new techniques to verify and validate (V&amp;V) the associated applications software. To compound the problem, changes in the application software sub- sequent to final certifications may require repeated certification testing, an expensive and time consuming process. Digital computer technology created the difficult validation problem; but it can also solve it through application of advances in design and validation tech- nology such as Finite State Machine (FSM), Logic Tree Graphic (LTG), and Robotic Testing (RT). With FSM, system design is described in precise manner that allows direct testing of design states. The LTG will allow the design of test cases using minimal cut 175</page><page sequence="157">821422 sets for failure combinations. In RT, the control of the test program, the detailed magnitude of the test, as well as the sequence of the test is exact and can be repeated in the same exact manner. 821423. Utilization of computer aided design for the development of advanced turbomachinery com- ponents. Peter S. Kuo and Ambros S. Hoffmann, AVCO Lycoming Div., Stratford, CT. Modern CAD/CAM systems have provided powerful design and manufacturing capabilities necessary for the development of advanced turbo-machinery components. This paper presents the examples of how CAD/CAM procedures are utilized in the modeling of complex structural systems and for defining accurate geometry for NC manufacturing. The achievements obtained by this cost effective and time-saving method are given herein together with descriptions of the computerized techniques used. 821424. Implementation and integration of process plan- ning. Frank A. Valdes, CAM Engineer, General Electric Company. A Computer Aided Process Planning (CAPP) system is being implemented in the manufacture of rotating com- ponents for aircraft engines. The system provides a process planning data base and a set of computerized techniques, all easily accessible from a multiple function computer graphics work station. This paper briefly describes the use of CAPP as contrasted with the traditional approach to process planning. The devel- opment of the system, the technologies involved in its design, and the implementation approach are also dis- cussed. 821426. (P-114) Design and flight test of one-man operability in the F/A-18. Charles E. Rosen- mayer and Michael J. Tkach, McDonnell Doug- las Corp. The F/A-18 has the capability to perform a greater variety of fighter/attack missions than any other single-place aircraft ever produced. This paper will not address any new discussion of the "one vs. two" crewmember situation, but only present the human factors engineering history that produced the current man-machine interface in the F/A-18. The extensive software capability of the airplane has made changes found desirable during flight test reasonably easy to incorporate into production aircraft. These changes encompass everything from aircraft handling qualities and display formats (heads-down and heads-up) to radar and weapons system operation. Previous aircraft have depended, in varying degrees, on the unique capabilities of the pilot to compensate for inherent crew station/weapon system deficiencies. The Hornet, from its inception, has been designed to help the pilot expand upon his capabilities - to give him more and better help toward the ultimate objective of his weapon system. 821427. (P-114) Trajectory generation - an automation concept of the future. T. E. Perfitt, Lear Siegler, Inc., Grand Rapids, MI.; and G. L. Fileccia and W. L. Young, A. F. Wright Aeronautical Lab- oratories, Dayton, OH. The authors review military and commercial develop- ments over the past decade that relate to trajectory generation. Airborne mission replanning and pilot deci- sion assistance that use trajectory generation are de- scribed. The Integrated Flight Management activity which integrates previous work into a cohesive system devel- opment is described. Trajectory generation applied to intra-flight time-space coordination is described in terms of improved combat effectiveness. In the view of the authors, trajectory generation is the key and central design philosophy for developing future integrated, automatic flight management systems. SAE Trans, Vol 91 821428. (P-114) Experiences in aiding airborne decision- making. J. Hopson, Naval Air Development Center.; and W. Zachary, Analytics. This paper describes research aimed at structuring decision augmentation system design by defining, devel- oping, and applying appropriate design techniques for a variety of airborne platforms. The goal of this research is to improve combined man/machine system performance by enhancing the integration of information in the total avionics system. Results from several studies are sum- marized and related to the systematic design/evaluation approach being advocated. The approach described includes: (1) identifying key decision situations and matching them to available decision augmentation tech- niques; (2) extracting, organizing, and summarizing experienced operator opinion about problems in unaided information processing tasks; (3) estimating effectiveness of candidate augmentation algorithms through the use of operator models; and (4) estimating the cost of candidate augmentation systems. The methods are discussed using examples from airborne anti-submarine-warfare. SAE Trans, Vol 91 821429. (P-114) Situational emergency training: expe- riences and implications. Luigi F. Lucaccini and Amos Freedy, Perceptronics, Inc. Situational Emergency Training (SET) involves the de- velopment of aircrew emergency decision skills in the context of the situational and psychological variables which characterize aircraft emergencies. A program was undertaken to study critical decision variables and their interactions within the framework of the mission scenario. One outcome was the specification of initial guidelines for a comprehensive SET program. The continued evolution of cockpit automation presents an additional decision- making requirement - the supervision of cockpit auto- mation systems and the attendant decisions to accept or override system actions. One aspect of decision making under supervisory control, the generation of hypotheses regarding systems malfunctions, is seen as critical and in 176</page><page sequence="158">need of further study.

Philumalee, Federal Aviation Administration, Systems En- gineering Service. The National Airspace System Plan delineates specific improvements for facilities and equipments which must be made in order to meet the projected demands of air transportation through the year 2000. The plan focuses on how to best accomplish the following objectives: - Accommodate spiralling demands for aviation services - Constrain costs - Recast the required technical framework - Deal with aging facilities The primary purpose of the modernization of the airspace system is to reduce operating costs while enhancing safety. This requires: - higher levels of automation - consolidation of major facilities 821431. (P-114) The FAA Air Traffic Controller Training Program with emphasis on student assessment. James O. Boone, Civil Aeromedicai Institute, Federal Aviation Administration, Oklahoma City, OK. Several recent incidents involving human safety in the operation of high technology equipment had led to a renewed interest in human factors in high technology, particularly in the selection and training of operating personnel. This paper describes a long term research effort by the FAA in the selection and training of personnel in the high technology air traffic control specialist occu- pation. The studies demonstrate that better selection and training of air traffic control specialists resulted in a cost-effective means to enhance human safety by pro- ducing more competent high technology air traffic personnel. These studies are generalized to other high technology industries where human safety is a prime concern. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821432. (P-114) The loss of prescribed separation between aircraft: how does it occur?David J. Schroeder, Civil Aeromedicai Institute, Federal Aviation Administration, Oklahoma City, OK. One measure of the effectiveness or safety of the Air Traffic Control system is the occurrence of an operational error. The purpose of this study was to determine contributing factors and conditions surrounding the occurrence of an operational error. A longitudinal analysis of controller workload at the time of the error revealed some time related changes. While most errors occurred under moderate workloads (40-50%), since 1965 the trend has been for a smaller percentage of errors to occur under heavy workload conditions, with an increase 821436 in the percentage involving light workloads. While the precise determination of causal factors is not possible with the current system, emphasis should be placed on the importance of attention, planning, judgment, coordina- tion, and communications. Some suggestions are made concerning the gathering of additional information during the review process to assist in the overall analysis of an operational error. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821434. The all electric airplane - benefits and challenges. Cary R. Spitzer and Ray V. Hood, NASA Langley Research Center. A brief definition of an "All Electric Airplane" will be presented. Several NASA and DOD studies have exam- ined the application of advanced electric/electronic technologies. The benefits identified in these studies will be summarized. The state-of-the-art in all electric airplane technology will be described. A NASA program has been proposed to develop the necessary technology base for industry application. The elements of this proposed program will be discussed. 821435. Electromechanical primary flight control acti- vation systems for fighter/attack aircraft. J. B. Leonard, Grumman Aerospace Corp., Bethpage, NY. Electromechanical Actuation Systems (EMAS) using advanced state-of-the-art technology offer significant benefits in primary flight control applications. Fighter and attack aircraft present the greatest challenge, but studies have shown feasibility for those applications. The use of samarium cobalt "inside-out" DC motors, solid-state power switching, and microprocessor control of com- mutation, current, and frequency are the advances that have made EMAS contenders for military aircraft appli- cations. Benefits include elimination of hydraulic systems, improved logistics, increased reliability, and lower life- cycle costs. The studies addressed actuation of canard and rudder control surfaces on supersonic Navy fighter aircraft. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821436. Design aspects of systems in all-electric aircraft. Michael J. Cronin, Lockheed-California Co. The paper deals with the emerging and topical subject of All-Electric Aircraft in which the electric system in an advanced airplane serves all the functions and services normally supplied by multiple power systems, such as engine bleed air, hydraulics, pneumatics, and conven- tional type electric power systems. Engine starting is of particular interest because of its demands for special logistic and maintenance ground support. Military and commercial aircraft typically use pneumatic, cartridge, fuel/air (combustion) or monopropellant starting meth- ods, so these must be replaced by electric starting. The trend of the advanced technology engines is towards high 177</page><page sequence="159">821436 bypass and high compression ratios, making them in- creasingly sensitive to tapping the compressor airflow: The energy-efficient engine is, therefore, an important design consideration in the All-Electric Airplane. The replacement of systems, such as hydraulics, used for hydromechanical actuation and powering of flight con- trols; the bleed air system, used for thrust reversing/air turbine motors and engine/ wing icing protection; the environmental control system, used for cabin/cockpit air conditioning, electric/avionic cooling; and the electric system for powering the electric/avionics systems are all key to the maturation of the All-Electric Airplane.

Finnerty, Project Engineer, AFWAL/POTA, Air Force Wright Aeronau- tical Lab. A Structural Life Prediction/Correlation (SLP/C) pro- gram developed advanced methods of analyzing cumu- lative fatigue damage to more accurately predict the LCF life of a fan disk for correlation to the experimentally determined life for an accelerated duty cycle. The critical location (bolt holes) of the fan disk was determined using detailed elastic finite element analyses. Special "calibrated models" of the bolt holes were designed and tested to determine the fatigue notch factor. A materials program characterized a specific heat of disk material (TÌ-6A1-4V) used in the program. The fan disk life was predicted based on materials, calibrated model and fan rotor test data for an accelerated cycle developed from a representative trainer mission. Two fan rotors were subjected to the accelerated duty cycle until crack initiation was detected, using eddy current techniques. Additional testing was conducted to determine the initial stages of crack propagation. Results indicate excellent correlation be- tween predicted and experimental crack initiation lives, whereas crack growth lives were overpredicted. SA E Trans ., Vol. 91 821438. Transient blade response due to surge induced structural loads. M. D. Rudy, Principal Engineer, Structural Analysis, Teledyne CAE. Axial compressor blade durability is addressed from the standpoint of a surge induced structural load. The qualitative characteristics of the aerodynamic and struc- tural dynamic phenomena of surge loads and deflections are considered. Pertinent technology from the available literature is surveyed and extended to specific aspects of the problem. Analytical models for predicting load magnitudes and distributions as a function of time are presented along with the corresponding transient struc- tural dynamic model. Results are presented for a isolated airfoil response. Assumptions, limitations, and parametric studies of the various components of the analytical models are discussed and areas of future work identified. Experimental programs which are required to validate the analytical model are proposed and the high response instrumentation requirements identified for rig or engine testing that will provide the detailed data for validating the analytical model. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821439. A unified approach to turbine blade life prediction. B. L. Lewis, Department Head, Structures Analysis, Teledyne CAE, Toledo, Ohio.; and L. R. Beckwith, Principal Engineer, Structures Analysis, Teledyne CAE, Toledo, Ohio. A computer based design analysis system for turbine blades has been implemented by assimilating state- of-the-art techniques in stress analysis, life prediction and material modeling, metal temperature prediction and probabilistic design philosophies. State-of-the-art capa- bilities in each of these technologies are reviewed and compared to those of the described system with an emphasis on the technologies of structural analysis and life prediction. Calibration of the constituents of the design system with extensive component and material characterization tests are described. A statistical design approach was chosen to deal with blade-to-blade uncer- tainties in fundamental design parameters and provide increased decision making visibility in the design process. The design system described is considered applicable to all aspects of turbine engine design life analysis. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821440. A computer-aided system for interactive geomet- ric modeling, structural/dynamics analysis and N/C manufacturing/inspection of radial flow compressors. Ross Culverhouse, Avco Lycoming Div., Stratford, CT. The technological advances which have been made in the computer hardware industry, from interaction computer graphics systems to numerically controlled manufacturing and inspection machines, has resulted in major changes in the impeller design process. The contents of this paper describes an "Interactive CAD/CAM Geometric Mod- eling System for Impellers" developed to integrate aerodynamic design, mechanical design, structural and dynamics analysis, manufacturing and quality assurance into an integrated CAD/CAM impeller system. The system allows for more design and analysis iterations to take place in a short time frame, resulting in optimized impeller designs. The system also reduces the lead time required for part fabrication and inspection from many months to a few weeks. 821441. The recipe for re-enginfng jet transports. Lloyd B. Aschenbeck, CAMMACORP. The relative newness of the DC-8-60's plus their advanced aerodynamic and structural technology combined with the CFM56-2 high by-pass engine results in a modern, economic aircraft. FAR Part 36 Noise Requirements and the prospect of ever increasing fuel costs make the retrofit DC-8-60's a prudent investment. The type certificate for these re- 178</page><page sequence="160">engined aircraft will designate them as DC-8-70's. Per- formance improvements, noise reduction and reduced fuel consumption provide distinct and quantifiable benefits to the operators of the DC-8-70's. These benefits are verified by the results of certification flight testing and will be presented in detail. 821442. Re-engining the 737. Jerome C. Baer, Project Engineer, 727/737 Sales Support, Boeing Com- mercial Airplane Company, Seattle, Washing- ton.; and Allan L. Schuehle, Senior Specialist Engineer, 727/737 Sales Support, Boeing Com- mercial Airplane Company, Seattle, Washing- ton. Opportunities exist to re-engine commercial airliners with new high-bypass-ratio engines. One such example is the Model 737-300, a derivative of the Advanced 737-200 airplane with two CFM56-3 engines. The ground clear- ance of the 737 and the increased engine diameter present a unique design problem. A close coupled nacelle/wing, a new leading edge slat, and a horizontal tail extension are required along with increased operational weights. About 20 passenger seats have been added. Noise levels and fuel consumption have been substantially reduced. 821443. 727, B-52 retrofit with PW2037 meeting today's requirements. Richard Altman, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, Commercial Products Division.; and Edward P. Flynn, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, Government Products Division. Offering aircraft fuel efficiency improvements of 30 to 40% over the powerplants it will replace, PW2037 retrofit in the 727-200 Advanced and B-52 aircraft is attracting heightened interest. A comparison of PW2037 technical characteristics with current aircraft powerplants substan- tiates the improvement potential. The engine installation and modifications necessary for aircraft system compat- ibility do not impose significant increases in complexity or cost. The resultant improvements in aircraft capability (727 and B-52) and economic viability to airlines (727) produce aircraft uniquely suited to today's operational requirements and constrained equipment budgets. 821444. Re-engining applications of T56 derivative en- gines. David Melchioris, Aeronautical Systems Div., Air Force Systems Command.; and Frank J. Verkamp, Detroit Diesel Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Twelve thousand T56 turboprop engines have been delivered to 49 countries for use in commercial and military aircraft. The Air Force and Navy are sponsoring a program to develop a cost effective T56 derivative engine with 10 1/2% fuel consumption improvement and 24% power increase. These improvements are being achieved by utilizing only previously demonstrated com- ponent technology, while retaining 90% parts common- ality with the current production T56 engine. Primary changes to the engine are in the compressor and turbine. Existing T56 engines can be upgraded to the new 821447 configuration via retrofit kits installed during normal engine overhaul. 821445. Re-engining studies on the P-3 aircraft. J. L. Benson, J. D. Dupcak, and A. J. Schuetz, Lockheed-California Co. The incentives for re-engining the Lockheed P-3 ASW Patrol aircraft include reduced fuel consumption and therefore reduced operating costs (the P-3 currently accounts for 16 percent of the U.S. Navy's annual aviation fuel bill), increased mission effectiveness in terms of radius of action (ROA) and time on station (TOS) (when needed), increased sales potential/production life, in- creased service life, and reduced maintenance hours. For these reasons, Lockheed has for several years conducted both Navy-funded and in-house-funded engineering stud- ies to identify the impact on performance and cost of re-engining the P-3 with either a derivative type or an all-new advanced turboprop (ATP) type engine. This paper discusses some of the results of these studies. In particular, the engines examined in these studies are compared from both a performance and installation design standpoint, with aircraft mission performance improvements identified. Program schedules and cost estimates are discussed, so that economic assessments/ trade-offs of the various options can be made. The paper also includes a discussion of current and far-term factors, which will affect the decision as to whether or not the P-3 aircraft is re-engined. 821446. The application of a liquid-cooled V-8 piston engine to general aviation aircraft. D. Lawrence Blackaller and Lee Muir, Thunder Engines, Inc. A 522 kW (700 hp), liquid-cooled, turbocharged, V-8 piston aircraft engine is being developed for Federal Aviation Administration certification with application directed toward repowering general aviation aircraft. Emphasis is on fuel-efficiency and altitude performance. Installation of this engine has the potential to expand the performance envelope of agricultural and turboprop twin engine aircraft. Performance estimations of two repre- sentative twin engine aircraft capable of using 522 kW (700 hp) engines show significant increases in maximum true airspeed, climb performance, choice of cruise air- speed, and cruise performance.

The Federal Aviation Administration is charged with the promotion of aviation safety. It is made up of three levels of administration within which are the functional organ- izations that manage the FAA programs and services. The Flight Standards service, which develops and enforces all regulations affecting aircraft and airmen, is the functional organization directly responsible for promoting aviation safety. This paper describes the Flight Standards aviation safety program. 179</page><page sequence="161">821448 821448. (P- 114) The Aviation Safety Analysis System (ASAS): an overview. William R. Fromme, Federal Aviation Administration. The Federal Aviation Administration has placed increas- ing emphasis on modern information systems to achieve safety improvements. The ASAS (Aviation Safety Anal- ysis System) is a comprhensive new system to upgrade significantly the agency's ability to collect, process, and disseminate safety-related information. 821449. (P-114) An objective look at helicopter auto- mation from a test pilot's point of view. John J. Shapley, Federal Aviation Administration. This paper will discuss some considerations regarding man-machine interface during helicopter instrument flight. Several misconceptions have existed regarding FAA helicopter IFR certification. In response to some concerns pertaining to "excessive workload considerations," de- signers have responded with several configurations. Some of these configurations have highlighted the need to educate the designer and the pilot population that the pilot must have the option to "actively participate" in the flight activity during helicopter IFR operations. "Active participation" includes the option of flying the vehicle through the normal flight controls. In addition, there has been some confusion regarding the terms "stability augmentation systems" and "auto- pilot." Some individuals use the terms interchangeably. This paper will discuss the various lessons learned during FAA certification of helicopters for IFR flight from a certification test pilot's viewpoint. It is the opinion of the author that automation devices should be available to the pilot to assist him in his tasks. The automation should not be used to replace the pilot in the performance of piloting tasks. If the pilot tasks offer little physical activity, it fails to be intrinsically motivating and amounts to a task of monitoring a machine. It is also reasonable to assume that the low activity level during normal operations may lead to an overloaded situation during failure conditions. In other words, it might be possible for a pilot to find himself in a position where the more he operates a vehicle, the less proficient (and safe) he becomes. 821450. (P-114) The impact of automation on flight test. George H. Lyddane, Federal Aviation Admin- istration. The rapid growth in digital computer technology and display systems has impacted most aerospace disciplines. The designer, manufacturer, operator and even airplane passengers are all affected by this technology boom. The FAA, in its role of certifying new aerospace products is no exception. This paper will emphasize the changing methodology of the FAA certification process with some specific examples of recent flight test programs. 821451. Certification of digital avionics. A review of recent FAA experience. James J. Treacy, Federal Aviation Administration. Certification of digital avionics creates a new challenge for the FAA primarily because software which controls these machines is subject to a new class of design errors not present in analog systems. Software errors can nullify system redundancy by affecting more than one system simultaneously. 821452. (SP-528) The shot peening of metals - mechanics and structures. S. T. S. Al-Hassani, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The University of Manchester, Institute of Science and Technol- ogy, U.K. Shot peening is viewed as a process involving multiple and progressively repeated impact. The residual stress field under each impact interacts with similarly produced neighbouring fields to finally produce a residual stress distribution varying in depth but uniform in planes, parallel to the surface. Statical and dynamical aspects of single impact are considered and a number of simple theoretical expressions for the parameters of the process are presented. New concepts such as shakedown, reversed plastic yielding and Bauschinger effect as well as strain rate are thought to contribute a significant role in the process. SAE Trans ., Vol. 91 821453. (SP-528) Shot peening - control and measure- ment. Michael M. Woelfel, Potters Industries Inc., Hasbrouck Heights, NJ. The Almen strip has for many years been the standard of control and measurement of the shot-peening process. The fatigue life increase obtained by peening, however, is not generally predictable by Almen intensity. In this paper, results of laboratory tests showing the Almen intensities and surface residual compressive stresses obtainable with glass and steel peening media of several sizes are reported. No correlation was found between residual stress and Almen intensity. The tests indicated that greater residual stresses were developed by smaller peening media. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821455. (SP-528) Advanced concepts of the process. Paul G. Feld and Daniel E. Johnson, Metal Im- provement Co. New methods of measuring and controlling coverage and, in special situations, intensities, have been developed and are gaining recognition by concerned users of shot peening. For coverage control a fluorescent material accurately reflects degree of coverage attained. Tech- niques for the peening of very small holes to achieve a uniform beneficial compressive stress is shown as well as a method of measuring intensity in holes too small to be checked by conventional Alman strips. Shot Peen Precondition of Autofrettage for improved fatigue life are combined to show significantly increased fatigue life in parts treated solely by either of these two 180</page><page sequence="162">processes alone. 821456. (SP-528) The application of shot peen forming technology to commercial aircraft wing skins. Douglas Moore, McDonnell Douglas Canada Ltd. Shot peen forming was selected by the McDonnell Douglas Corporation as the only viable method of contouring wing skin planks for the DC 10 airliner. The parameters to form the skin planks were developed by Metal Improvement Company Inc. An overview of the shot peen forming operations is presented covering the technical and tooling requirements and documentation. Reference is made to the subtle angular and/or dimen- sional changes which can occur during forming of complex contours on large skin planks. The significant engineering and manufacturing advantages of the process led to incorporation of the technology in the design of the new DC9 Super 80. These criteria are expected to be equally applicable on the next generation commercial aircraft. 821459. (SP-529) Pulse excitation techniques. F. B. Safford, Agbabian Associates, El Segundo, CA. A series of rectangular or other simple pulses can be convolved with the impulse functions of a structure to induce motions closely approximating those caused by natural and manmade events. Control of the excitation; portability to the site; ease of attachment to the structure; multiaxial excitation; low cost of excitation equipment; and the ability to excite structures from simple harmonic motion to expected multifrequency response-time histories are possible by the development of pulse techniques. Recent investigations have also disclosed the utility of pulse techniques to oppose structural motions as in earthquakes or in large antenna arrays in space. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821460. (SP-529) System identification using sinusoidal test data. Kenneth D. Blakely and Michael W. Dobbs, ANCO Engineers, Inc., Culver City, CA. System identification - the refinement of an analytical model to match test data - is presented as it pertains to dynamic testing via sinusoidal shakers. Each phase of the system identification process is illustrated: pretest model formulation, sinusoidal testing, eigenparameter identi- fication, and post-test model refinement. Examples are shown from full-scale sinusoidal tests on actual structures. Also included is a brief discussion of structural nonlinearities and their effects on results obtained from the system identification process. 821461. Aircraft super integrated power unit. James A. Williams and Armando D. Lucci, Rockwell International/Rocketdyne Div., Canoga Park, CA.; and Buryl L. McFadden, Air Force Aeropropulsion Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base, OH. An SIPU is a single aircraft power unit capable of providing (1) electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic power 821464 for ground maintenance and stand-by operations, (2) normal main engine start power, (3) emergency in-flight electrical and hydraulic power, and (4) in-flight emer- gency main engine restart power. Power can be obtained from: jet fuel combustion with air for the ground operations and normal engine starts; a gas generator system using on-board stored propellants for the emer- gency power and emergency engine restart functions; and the aircraft main engine compressor air as a second source for the emergency electrical and hydraulic power function. An SIPU concept demonstration program is currently near completion at Rockwell International's Rocketdyne Division, sponsored by the Aeropropulsion Laboratory at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. The program is for design, fabrication, assembly, and test of a demonstrator SIPU capable of performing all four functions. 821462. Super Integrated Power Unit (SIPU) for the F-16 engine start system. W. Glen Smith and Richard J. Fandel, Sundstrand Aviation, Div. of Sund- strand Corp., Rockford, IL. The F-16 main engine inflight restart capability would be greatly enhanced by utilizing a Super Integrated Power Unit (SIPU). Because the available starter power remains constant at all altitudes, the engine can be motored at relatively high rotative speeds, providing for rapid acceleration to a self sustaining condition after relight. This reduced start time plus a multiple start capability, reduces altitude loss and increases safety during combat. The SIPU concept expands the airstart window and allows the pilot to assume a "best range" flight attitude which maximizes both time and range by up to 35% in the event the engine is not able to start. 821464. Application of a hot gas high pressure rotary vane motor to aircraft APU starting. L. D. Galbraith, W. E. Jorgenson, and D. A. Pähl, Rocket Research Co.; and B. L. McFadden, Aeropro- pulsion Laboratory, Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Analyses and tests have been conducted on a hot gas rotary vane motor suitable for aircraft APU starting over the temperature range of -65° to +130° F (-54° to + 54°C). Testing of the motor has been accomplished with gaseous nitrogen and hydrazine-based monopropellant hot gas decomposition products. Revisions to the motor configuration reduced total gas consumption 52 percent compared to the original baseline and eliminate end clearance sensitivity. Analytical studies, verified by test results, indicated the effect of friction coefficient, blade weight, and venting of the blade on overall internal friction. Further studies evaluated linking pairs of blades to minimize centrifugal force effects. Tests currently in progress are aimed at selecting the optimum blade material. 181</page><page sequence="163">821467 821467. Low-speed aerodynamic characteristics of a generic forward-swept-wing aircraft. J. C. Ross, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA.; and A. D. Matarazzo, Fairchild Republic Co., Farmingdale, NY. Low-speed wind-tunnel tests were performed on a generic forward-swept-wing aircraft model in the 7- by 10-Foot Wind Tunnel (No. 2) at Ames Research Center. The effects of various configurational changes and control- surface deflections on the performance of the model were measured. Six-component force measurements were aug- mented by flow-visualization photographs, using both surface oil-flow and tufts. It was found that the tendency toward premature root separation on the forward-swept wing could be reduced by use of either canards or leading-edge wing strakes and that differential canard deflections can be used to produce direct side-force control. SA E Trans., Vol. 91 821468. Optimal turning climb-out and descent of com- mercial jet aircraft. F. Neuman and E. Kreindler, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA. Optimal turning climb-out and descent flight-paths from and to rünway headings are derived to provide the missing elements of a complete flight-path optimization for minimum fuel consumption. The paths are derived by generating a field of extremals, using the necessary conditions of optimal control. Results show that the speed profiles for straight and turning flight are essentially identical, except for the final horizontal accelerating or decelerating turn. The optimal turns, which require no abrupt maneuvers, could easily be integrated with present climb-cruise-descent fuel-optimization algorithms. 821469. Flight at supernormal attitudes. Thomas H. Strom and William J. Alford, Jr., Dynamic Engineering Inc., Newport News, VA. In Supernormal Flight (SNF), the aircraft's wing is either partially or completely stalled, while the longitudinal stabilizing and control surfaces are deflected to approx- imately the same magnitude, but of opposite sign, as the aircraft's angle of attack so that they remain effective through large ranges (approaching 90°) of angles of attack, pitch, and flight path. Some potential advantages of SNF include: improved safety through prevention of spins; rapid recovery from undesirable stalls and spins; steep descents and approaches to landings; precise, steep, survivable recoveries of remotely piloted vehicles (RPVs); and enhanced maneuverability and agility. Free-flight, wind tunnel, and analytic results are presented on example aircraft models to illustrate and substantiate the proposed applications and advantages. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821475. Experimental evaluation of inlet turbulence, wall boundary layer, surface finish, and fillet radius on small axial turbine stator performance. Andrew A. Kozak and Walter D. Brockett, AVCO, Lycoming Div., Stratford, CT.; and Jeffrey E. Haas, AVRADCOM Research and Technolo- gies Laboratories. The results of an experimental investigation are presented which establish the effects of surface finish, fillet radius, inlet boundary layer thickness, and free-stream inlet turbulence level on the aerodynamic performance of a small axial flow turbine stator. The principal objective was to help understand why large turbine efficiency is not maintained when a large turbine is scaled to a smaller size and to provide the turbine designer with the performance compromises expected for a small scale design. A comprehensive test matrix was used to gain an under- standing of the effects of each variable over the full range of all the other variables. 821476. (P-114) The prime mental state in flight opera- tions. James E. Crane, Embry-Riddle Aeronau- tical Univ. Using the word "prime," which in this paper indicates first in quality, to describe a mental state takes on a special meaning. This paper discusses many of the factors, such as memory, judgement, feelings, movement, body chemistry, and variations in consciousness, which affect the achieve- ment of the prime mental state in flight operations. 821477. (SP-529) Use of digital signal processing, modal testing, and finite element techniques in equip- ment qualification and acceptance testing. James B. Steedman, National Technical Systems, Structural Dynamics Laboratory.; and Arthur Edelstein, National Technical Systems, Engi- neering Div. A systematic procedure in which digital signal processing, modal testing and finite element techniques can be used in equipment qualification and acceptance testing is pre- sented. A new method was also developed, in which measured transmissibility functions and Fourier trans- formation techniques were combined to compute in- strument response spectra. As an illustrative example of the qualification method, the paper follows the quali- fication of a safety related Class IE Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Control Panel subjected to both seismic and hydrodynamic loading conditions. 821479. (SP-529) Spacecraft model verification using swept sine data analysis. John R. Fowler and William F. Davis, Hughes Aircraft Co., El Segundo, CA.; and Emmet Dancy, Hewlett- Packard, Los Angeles, CA. Spacecraft sinusoidal vibration test data is analyzed, using overlap processing, to compute transfer functions and to determine frequencies, damping, and modal amplitudes. Results are compared with results obtained from random vibration test data and show excellent agreement. The overlap processing method, therefore, is acceptable for performing system identification computations from typical swept sine vibration test data. Use of alternative 182</page><page sequence="164">reference point for computation of transfer functions is discussed. 821481. (SP-529) Modal analysis of rigid bodies supported by low frequency pneumatic vibration isolators. H. Dennis Sigel, Newport Corp.; and Gerard C. Pardoen, University of California, Irvine. Classical techniques for determining accurate frequencies and modes of a rigid body supported by pneumatic vibration isolation mounts were deemed unsatisfactory. It was found that the isolator's transfer functions were nonlinear and exhibited frequency dependent stiffness and damping characteristics. To overcome these short- comings a computer model of the isolator's frequency response was developed by curve fitting a Laplace polynomial to the experimentally derived transfer func- tions. By mathematically combining the isolator's re- sponse characteristics with a variety of rigid bodies the total system's performance under a number of laboratory configurations could be efficiently predicted. 821482. (SP-529) A random vibration control system for testing a single test item with multiple inputs. David O. Smallwood, Sandia National Labo- ratories. This paper describes a multiple shaker control system developed at Sandia National Laboratories for driving a single test item with random excitation. The system allows for cross-coupled mechanical systems with partially coherent control points. The system uses time-domain randomization to generate the continuous Gaussian drive signals.

The FAA's current aircraft crash dynamics engineering and development program plan elements are addressed. The overall program logic is delineated in a manner which illustrates the synergistic effect of each individual program element. Deficiencies in past and current findings are presented along with proposed means of resolving these issues. The subject crash dynamics program is structured to develop the technical data base and methodologies necessarily required to assess the crash dynamic envi- ronment and occupant survivability characteristics of transport category aircraft. 821484. Effectiveness of seat cushion blocking layer materials against cabin fires. Constantine P. Sarkos and Richard G. Hill, Federal Aviation Administration. Materials are available for preventing or retarding aircraft cabin fires involving urethane foam seat cushions. Real- istic fire tests performed in a wide-body test article demonstrate that some in-flight and ramp fires can be prevented, and that the allowable time for safe evacuation can be significantly extended during a survivable post- 821487 crash fuel fire, when the urethane foam seat cushion is covered by a "blocking layer" material. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821485. Testing of antimisting kerosene in the DC- 10/KC-10 fuel system simulator. A. T. Peacock and F. Y. Ching, McDonnell Douglas Corpo- ration, Douglas Aircraft Company, Long Beach, California. The compatibility of antimisting kerosene (AMK) with a contemporary fuel system was evaluated. AMK made with the FM-9 additive to the base fuel was used throughout the program. Tests were conducted to deter- mine the effects AMK had on the components and system performance, and the effects components and the system had on the fuel. Some DC-10/KC-10 systems are incom- patible with the AMK fuel. Systems and/or procedural revisions to accommodate the AMK do not appear to present technically insurmountable problems. AMK re- duces the performance of some systems below normally accepted levels. Additional studies and testing would be required to certify the aircraft fuel system for use with the FM-9 AMK. 821486. An FAA analysis of aircraft emergency evacuation demonstrations. Sharon A. Barthelmess, Federal Aviation Administration. Average continuous flow rates for each type of aircraft exit were examined in 89 full-scale evacuation demon- strations. Passengers tend to form continuous lines at available exits when evacuating an airplane. The study concludes that, with rare exception, the passenger rates of egress from the same type exit on different make and model airplanes are not significantly different. Passenger cabin configuration, seat pitch, and aisle width have no significant bearing on the egress rates provided the aircraft certification requirements for minimum aisle width and exit accessibility are met. Injuries resulting from actual emergency evacuations and evacuation demonstrations are also examined. 821487. Repairing gas turbine hot section airfoils today. J. H. Wilkens, Consultant to Chromalloy Research and Technology Div. The team approach to development and application of repair techniques for gas turbine hot section airfoils can be effective in achieving goals of product safety, conser- vation of critical materials, thermal protection and operational cost control. This concept is explored and various repair techniques and processes are described as well as is their interrelation. Included is the application of hot-isostatic-pressing, diffusion joining, controlled cham- ber tungsten inert gas welding, electrical discharge machining, laser drilling, electro-chemical machining, abrasive flow machining, airfoil replacement and blade tip sulfidation repair. Protective coatings considered are low pressure plasma spray, physical vapor deposition, plat- inum aluminide pack coating and overcoating. An example of cost effectiveness is presented. 183</page><page sequence="165">821487 Repair engineering can extend useful life of hot section airfoils without compromising safety, critical materials and cost considerations. 821489. Major hot section component salvaged through advanced repair methods.. B. J. Granatele, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. This paper describes Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft's refur- bishment method for upgrading in-service JT9D low pressure turbine cases with a redesigned front flange section of the case. Refurbishment was made possible by the development of electron beam welding techniques for the forged Incoloy 901 nickel-base alloy in the case. The techniques developed minimize heat affected zone inter- granular stress cracks which historically have been a deterent to structural welds in Incoloy 901. 821490. Experiences in repair of hot section gas turbine components. M. H. Haafkens, Elbar B.V., Lomm, The Netherlands. The repair and recovery of both the stationary and the rotating parts of the hot section of a gas turbine are becoming more and more generally accepted practice. Due to the necessity for repairs on heavily loaded rotating blades and buckets made out difficult to weld nickelbase superalloys, such as In738, U720 and In939, the need arose for fundamental investigations on repair and recovery procedures with a high turbine operation reliability. The investigation began at Elbar about 5 years ago under different contracts from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, within a European collaboration in the fields of: a) welding of superalloys b) powder metallurgy including hipping of superalloys c) diffusion bonding of superalloys d) repair brazing of superalloys e) development of new diffusion coatings for super- alloys, such as 1 step NiCrAlYs, sulfidation resistant coatings such as "Silicon-Titanium" and new thermal barrier coatings for superalloys. As result of this research, new repair techniques have been developed which improve the reliability of repairs extensively. It has been proved that repaired blades are often better than new blades because of the use of superior materials, better coatings and modified heat treatments. 821493. (P-l 14) Human factors technology for America's space program. Melvin D. Montemerlo, National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA is initiating a space human factors research and technology development program in October 1982. The impetus for this program stems from: the frequent and economical access to space provided by the Shuttle, the advances in control and display hardware/software made possible through the recent explosion in microelectronics technology, heightened interest in a space station, height- ened interest by the military in space operations, and the fact that the technology for long duration stay times for man in space has received relatively little attention since the Apollo and Skylab missions. The rationale for and issues in the five thrusts of the new program are described. The main thrusts are: basic methodology, crew station design, ground control/operations, teleoperations and extra vehicular activity. 821495. (P-l 14) Space shuttle crew station requirements - past and future. John A. Roebuck, Jr., Space Operations/Integration and Satellite Systems Div., Rockwell International Corp. The flight deck of the Space Shuttle orbiter was strongly influenced by traditional transport aircraft concepts as well as by newer concepts such as all-electronic, com- puter-aided controls and time-shared CRT displays. This paper discusses crewmembers' reach and vision inter- actions with control and display interfaces in relation to automation concepts of the piloting, manipulator, berth- ing, and payload handling stations. Three critical stages of flight (boost, docking and berthing, and descent) are emphasized as key issues in the design of crew stations. The pilot's role during ascent is mainly one of monitoring a computer-controlled vehicle. Descent permits a choice of automated or manual control for energy management of a high-speed aerodynamic glider. On-orbit operations include berthing, docking, and handling of payloads with a computer-aided remote manipulator system (RMS). Future use of the RMS may call for the addition of force sensors, proximity sensors, and automatic homing devices to enhance productivity. 821496. (P-l 14) Distribution of man-machine controls in space teleoperation. Antal K. Bejczy, Jet Pro- pulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Tech- nology, Pasadena, CA. The distribution of control between man and machine is dependent on the tasks, available technology, human performance characteristics and control goals. This dependency has very specific projections on systems designed for teleoperation in space. This paper gives a brief outline of the space-related issues and presents the results of advanced teleoperator research and devel- opment at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The research and development work includes smart sensors, flexible computer controls and intelligent man-machine interface devices in the area of visual displays and kinesthetic man-machine coupling in remote control of manipulators. Some of the development results have been tested at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) using the simulated full-scale Space Shuttle Remote Manipulator System (RMS). The research and development work for advanced space teleoperation is far from complete and poses many interdisciplinary challenges. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821498.

(P- 114) Satellite servicing through space tele- presence. Richard A Spencer, Martin Marietta.; and Thomas Depkovich, Denver Aerospace. The re-emergence of interest in onorbit satellite servicing is evident by the increased relevant activities by potential space users. This new interest could be attributed to the explosion in all robotics technology areas or the increases in overall space program costs. Either is substantial in itself but may provide a synergistic benefit when consid- ered together. This paper presents a new look at an old subject with a prime objective of using emerging state- of-the-art technology to hold down program cost projec- tions. Program constraints include using current state- of-the-art and telepresence control from a ground control station with minimum implementation of automation. The space system proposed for this application consisted of a Remote Orbital Servicing System (ROSS) with manipu- lator arms, viewing cameras, and a replacement module stowage rack; and a ground control station with stereo viewing and two 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) hand controllers.

A perspective on the helicopter industry. Frank L. Jensen, Jr., Helicopter Association Internation- al. The Helicopter Association International (HAI) is an independent organization of close to 1000 member companies who own, operate or manufacture helicopters. HAI represents and promotes the helicopter interests of our members to government, business and industry, the news media and the public. HAI is a truly international organization, with members in 46 countries. Much of this presentation is equally applicable in other countries; but for the purpose of this synopsium, it is aimed primarily at the domestic helicopter situation within the United States. The helicopter provides unique benefits to our society and our economy. Among these are valiant rescue missions, law-enforcement, conservation and development of energy, commuter transport and many more. Yet, despite these benefits, the capabilities of our advanced technology helicopters and the contributions they make to the National Transportation System are not known to the national, state and local levels of government. The two main problems limiting the growth of the commercial helicopter industry are the lack of terminal facilities and the presence of noise. The solution of these two issues -- heliport development and environmental constraints ~ are strongly interdependent. 821508. Future rotorcraft technologies. John F.

Flexure testing is used as a qualification test method for hydraulic tube fittings and as a development tool to evaluate the flexure fatigue performance of tube connec- tions. The background of this test is described, and examples of test data for various tube to fitting connec- tions and tube materials presented. The standardization status of this test method is discussed and suggestions for further standardization efforts added. 821513. Space Shuttle Orbiter auxiliary power unit flight performance. R. McKenna and L. Wicklund, Sundstrand Energy Systems, Rockford, Illinois.; J. Baughman, Rockwell International, Downey, California.; and D. Weary, NASA- JSC, Hous- ton, Texas. The Space Shuttle Orbiter auxiliary power units (APUs) provide hydraulic power for the Orbiter vehicle control surfaces (rudder/speed brake, body flap, and elevon actuation systems), main engine gimbaling during ascent, landing gear deployment, and steering and braking during landing. Operation occurs during launch/ascent, in-space exercise, re-entry/descent, and landing/rollout. Operational effectiveness of the APU is predicated on reliable, failure-free operation during each flight, mission life (reusability) and serviceability between flights (turn- around). The flight data from the Orbiter Flight Tests (STS-1 through-4) is presented along with improvements to ensure that these long-run objectives are achieved. 821514.

Rizzo, Crucible Compaction Metals Operation.; J. Lane, U.S. Army.; and J. H. Moll, Crucible Research Center. Powder metallurgy (P/M) technology has been identified as a major means for reducing critical element usage for superalloy turbine engine hardware. Utilizing quality and process control, a P/M process has been successfully developed and applied to producing hardware for General Electric's T700 engine used in the Army's Blackhawk helicopter. Utilizing the process, a cost saving of ap- proximately $3000 per engine has been realized and a weight reduction of 40 lbs of superalloy starting material per engine has been achieved. Over 6000 parts have been produced to date and more than 800 engines have been delivered. The high time engine has achieved over 1900 hours operating time. A total of over 200,000 engine operating hours have been accumulated by as-HIP turbine hardware. This engine experience and mechanical prop- erty data show that the P/M process is capable of producing high quality reliable hardware for turbine engine applications. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821517.

Air cargo terminals: front-line elements of a universal, ever-functioning global network. Mor- ton A. Breier, Breier Neidle Patrone Associates. This paper introduces the reader to the air cargo terminal design process, and then utilizes three project histories to exemplify this process. The wide variation in air cargo terminal designs is explained by describing the range of variables that form the basis of a forecast analysis. The range of resultant parameters that constitute the objectives and requirements of the design are presented. The typical major functional elements of an air cargo terminal are then outlined. The particularities of the design process are exem- plified by describing three major air cargo terminal projects including each project's history, major objectives, resultant design, and ongoing development. These are: HACTL'S CONSOLIDATED AIR CARGO TER- MINAL AT KAI TAK AIRPORT, HONG KONG EMERY'S EXPRESS HUB, DAYTON, OHIO, U.S.A.

American Airlines, faced with the need to ground inefficient Boeing 707 airfreighters, opted in 1981 to expand its 747 freighter fleet, add Hercules "hub planes", and increase hub trucking operations. The Hercules' ability to carry the 10-foot M-l (8 X 8 cross section) containers, its lift capacity and short haul economics made the aircraft particularly attractive as the hub airfreighter. The hub planes feed 747 freighters at New York, Chicago, and San Juan; they also provide freighter service to Boston, Cleveland, Port au Prince, Haiti, and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The planes are operated under lease arrangements with Southern Air Transport of Miami, Florida and Transamerica Airlines of Oakland California. American's revenue and cost projections for hub plane operations are being met and the Hercules have proven the best available alternative to the grounded 707 freighters. The hub plane operation is a concept that merits consideration for expansion when the opportunities present themselves. 821554. LD-3 container ground handling - update for the 1980's. Ralph H. K. Cramer, Merlin Consult- ants, Inc. The introduction of wide body aircraft into commercial airline service in 1969 culminated what was perhaps the greatest concentrated United States aviation engineering effort ever made. The magnificent Boeing 747 followed shortly by the equally fine Douglas DC- 10 and the Lockheed L-1011 aircraft were truly aviation marvels. To handle the high volume of baggage and freight that these airplanes could carry the lower fuselage area was designed to carry containers. These containers were transported to and from the aircraft by means of a trailer train, normally consisting of four or five trailers carrying single LD-3 or similar containers. Unfortunately, subsequent field experience of the initial container handling equipment has been poor. The upgrading of the design of ramp container handling equipment for the 1980's focuses on the elimination of recurring problems. Attention was paid to improving reliability and decreasing maintenance requirements. Designs to insure efficiency in operations and main- tenance were developed by exhaustive reviews of many alternatives before a system was finalized. Fuel economy was treated as sacred. Last, but by no means least, operator's conveniences and safety were refined as much as possible. 821555. Interoperability of military and civil air-cargo systems. Paul D. Tuck, Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff, Studies and Analyses, HQ US Air Force, Washington, DC. This paper compares military/civil air-cargo systems in terms of: (i) in-plane hardware; (ii) materials-handling 821556 equipment (MHE); and (iii) unit load devices (ULDs). A need exists to have available, on short notice, a US airlift system for deployment of cargo/troops to remote points of operation. The Department of Defense (DOD) recently expressed a requirement for increased interoperability between military and civil air cargo systems. Interest in interoperability is also indicated by the Advanced Civil/ Military Aircraft (ACMA) concept. The ACMA may be described as an aircraft for fulfilling both US needs for strategic airlift and world-wide needs for civil air freight in the mid-1990s and beyond. The advances and devel- opment of cargo-capable aircraft and their in-plane cargo-handling systems have historically paced devel- opment of complementary ground systems. The military system relies heavily on and revolves around the 88 "X 108" pallet. The civil system relies to a greater extent on intermodal containers and the 88 " or 96 " X 125 " civil pallets. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821556. Systems analysis of preliminary aircraft designs for commercial cargo service. W. J. Rowe and J. C. Hedstrom, Lockheed-Georgia Co., Marietta, GA. Uncertain economic conditions in the airline industry and the relatively small market for new freighter aircraft offer little encouragement that new pure commercial freighter aircraft programs can be launched. But at the same time, any proposed new large aircraft design should be thoroughly analyzed for many different applications, including commercial all-cargo service. Design decisions based on these studies will determine what design features are added to a new aircraft to enhance its air cargo capabilities. This analysis should be approached by considering the complex interactions of the various components of the air cargo system, including aircraft as well as the operational practices of carriers, route networks, traffic, costs, prices, financial arrangements, and so on. Although some individual components of the air cargo system have been extensively studied and modeled, there is no readily available model that inte- grates the components of the system so that aircraft designs can be routinely evaluated for profitability in commercial all-cargo service. We have applied a systems analysis approach to provide insight into and understanding of the complex interactions between many components of the air cargo industry, and to develop useful models of the system. This approach, while it simplifies the real system considerably, highlights the problems of determining how to evaluate an aircraft design. Our goal is to produce significantly more useful models to evaluate tradeoffs during the preliminary aircraft design phase. This should enhance the effec- tiveness of a particular design in commercial air cargo operations. A similar approach should also be applicable to many other problems that call for analysis of the commercial air transport system. 187</page><page sequence="169">821557 821557. Investment risk and decision analyses for cargo airline operators. J. M. Norman, W. J. Campbell, and F. L. Rooney, Lockheed-Georgia Company, Marietta, Georgia. In the past, Airfreight Operators have minimized their investment risk by purchasing used passenger aircraft converted to carry cargo. Their investment decisions have been made on a short-term planning horizon without considering the long-term effects. This trend will soon reverse itself because of the sharp increase in fuel costs, the "cutthroat" competition resulting from deregulation and, most importantly, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 that provides new tax incentives which favor the purchase of new aircraft over used equipment. The purpose of this paper is to describe the investment analysis and tools that have been recently developed at Lockheed-Georgia Company. These tools can be used to measure the economic worth and risk of alternative aircraft operating within the system of any given Air Cargo Operation. These investment decision models can be used by air cargo management as aids in making aircraft purchase decisions that will affect the future of their companies. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821558. Derivative air freighters are winners. H. F. Morrison, McDonnell Douglas Corporation, Douglas Aircraft Company, Long Beach, Cali- fornia. Derivative air freighters that capitalize on technological advances incorporated in their passenger aircraft baselines will provide for the growth in commercial air cargo lift capacity required for the remainder of the century. With new fuel-efficient engines and other design advances, cash operating cost reductions of up to 40 percent will counter pressures fostered by increasing fuel prices and other adversities. Analytical data from recent air cargo surveys reaffirm the compatibility of present-day air cargo and container load characteristics with derivative freighter loaded-density capabilities. The nonrevenue-producing tare densities of containers, however, remain excessive in accounting for up to 25 percent of gross loaded densities. This results in added fuel-burn, added cost, and possible displacement of revenue-producing cargo, and must be accounted for in establishing tariffs.

The first 747 Freighter, delivered to Lufthansa on March 9, 1972, marked the beginning of a new era in air cargo transportation. Since then developments applied to the 747 Freighter not only increased its cargo volume and range capability, but also reduced its operating cost per unit of cargo. Today 747 Freighters provide efficient worldwide service and transport two-thirds of all the air cargo in the commercial freighter market. The future will see new technologies applied to the 747 Freighter; improvements that will continue to reaffirm its position as the leader in the air cargo transportation market. These developments will repeat the patterns of the past, i.e., delivering the most productive, most efficient, most successful freighter aircraft into the marketplace. SAE Trans., Vol. 91 821570. (SP-531) Fuels and lubricants for internal combustion engines: an historical perspective. Harld J. Gibson This paper briefly chronicles the history of fuels and lubricants for internal combustion engines in the United States. Actually, it is devoted primarily to fuels and lubricants for Otto-cycle engines. Needless to say, since books could be written on this subject, this paper provides only a high-spot review of those happenings that the author believes were particularly significant. No attempt has been made to discuss in any detail the technology involved in modern fuels and lubricants. That discussion is the function of the remaining papers in this series. The author has drawn heavily on his 46 years in the laboratories of the Ethyl Corporation as well as a variety of sources. Inevitably, the paper represents to a large extent the opinions of the author. 821571. (SP-531) What does the engine designer need to know about engine oils?Frank X. Sieloff and Jerry L. Musser, The Lubrizol Corporation. The functions of engine oil are reviewed. The chemistry of engine oil additives and synthetics is described in terms for the non-chemist. The latest SAE engine oil viscosity classifications and API service designations are detailed. Developments underway to upgrade engine oil quality are discussed. 821572. (SP-531) The production of alternative fuels. Robert G. Jackson, Conoco Coal Development Company, Stamford, Connecticut, U.S.A. Since man first began to use energy intensively, he has been aware of the need for alternative fuels to the ones he depended on. Today, that search is to find an alternative to crude oil based fuels. This paper outlines the available resouces of energy other than crude oil, describes the methods of producing these energy resources and dis- cusses how and when some may find increased usage. The paper concludes that for some years to come, we shall continue to depend on crude oil, but that by the beginning of the next century we shall begin to make use of some of the alternatives, particularly coal and uranium. 821573. (SP-531) Applications of alternative fuels. Roberta J. Nichols, Engineering and Research Staff, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, Mich- igan, U.S.A. An overview of the physical and chemical properties which affect combustion efficiency and exhaust emissions of engines is given for several alternative fuels considered to be candidates for use in the future. Applications of four of these fuels in Ford vehicles is described, including the 188</page><page sequence="170">ethanol production vehicles in Brazil, the 40-cār methanol fleet in California, the AFV (Alternative Fuel Vehicle) show car, and the 1982 dedicated LPG (liquefied petro- leum gas) production vehicle. 821574. (SP-532) Design considerations for valve gear. Bryce A. Buuck, Eaton Corporation. The fundamental features in designing a valve gear are discussed in this paper. Covered are: valve types; operating mechanisms; valve gear design considerations; and component design considerations such as valves, valve guides, spring retainers and locks, the cam follower, the camshaft, and valve springs. 821575. (SP-532) Engine torque and balance character- istics. Donald J. Patterson, University of Mich- igan. Beginning with a discussion of the slider-crank mecha- nism, the paper continues with the pressure, inertia, and friction forces which produce torque on the crank. The remainder of the paper is devoted to the subject of balance characteristics in various types of engines. 821576. (SP-532) General friction considerations for engine design. Richard C. Rosenberg, Mechan- ical Research Department, General Motors Research Laboratories. Reductions in engine friction can improve engine thermal efficiency and thereby reduce vehicle fuel consumption. Lubrication regimes encountered in the engine range from high-friction boundary-lubricated contacts where the coefficient of friction may be as high as 0.2 to low-friction hydrodynamic contacts where the coefficient of friction could be as low as 0.001. The particular design technique used to minimize friction depends on the regime in which the contact is operating. For boundary lubricated con- tacts, such as the cam-lifter or the oil-control rings, the most effective technique is to reduce the normal load acting on the contact. For hydrodynamically lubricated contacts, such as the journal bearings or the piston skirt, a reduction in the area of the contact is effective. 821577. (SP-532) Effects of inlet and exhaust system design on engine performance. Rodney J. Tabac- zynski, Ford Motor Co. A systematic approach for assessing the breathing per- formance of an engine for zero tuning effects is presented and a discussion of the various techniques and theories for predicting tuning effects for the exhaust and intake systems is given. 821578. (SP-532) Effects of combustion chamber design on combustion in spark ignition engines. James N. Mattavi, General Motors Research Labo- ratories. Combustion chamber design, through its strong influence on the rate at which energy is released during combustion, plays a key role in determining engine performance. To aid in understanding the effects of chamber design, the link is established, first between energy-release rate and 821578 critical performance parameters such as efficiency, emis- sions, power stability, tolerance to dilution, roughness and knock. Design approaches are then explored for con- trolling the energy-release raté. Supplementing these general approaches is an examination of the effects of specific design features on energy release and engine performance. Finally, a number of contemporary engines incorporating these design features are reviewed. 189</page></plain_text>
