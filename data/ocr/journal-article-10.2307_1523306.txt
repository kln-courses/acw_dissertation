<plain_text><page sequence="1">OYA PANCAROGLU SOCIALIZING MEDICINE: ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE KITAB AL-DIRYAQ Among the earliest extant Islamic illustrated manu- scripts are two copies of an Arabic text on antidotes derived from or used as remedy for snake venom. It is known by the short title, Kitdb al-dirygq (Book of Antidotes).' The earlier of the two copies, dated Rabi' I 595 (1199), is in the Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris (arabe 2964) and the second, datable towards the middle of the thirteenth century, is in the National- bibliothek, Vienna (A.F. 10).2 Although the figural style of the paintings persuaded at least one scholar to attribute both manuscripts to Iran, it is more com- monly thought that they originate in the Jazira.3 The importance of both manuscripts for the study of early Islamic painting has long been recognized in the scholarship. Along with about a dozen other illustrated manuscripts from the first half of the thir- teenth century, they constitute the earliest milestones in an increasingly more sophisticated tradition of il- lustrated codices. This recognition of their signifi- cance, however, has been achieved mostly at the cost of a fragmentary understanding of their pictorial pro- grams. Discussion of such early manuscripts, based on style and elements of iconography, has most fre- quently revolved around questions of attribution to various schools of painting. Although discrete icono- graphic elements, such as the frontispieces or the portraits of authors and scholars, have prompted in- depth studies on the sources of imagery,4 by and large, such studies have not been concerned with connect- ing their findings with the overall pictorial program in any given manuscript. The aim of this essay is to shift the focus of in- quiry away from perennial questions of attribution in an attempt to redress the fragmentary reception of the illustrated Kitdb al-dirygq, particularly the copy in Paris, by revisiting the entirety of its painting pro- gram. As the earliest extant dated Islamic manuscript illustrated with extensive figural paintings, the picto- rial sequence in the Paris manuscript reveals a distinct humanistic attitude in representing the acquisition and transmission of knowledge as a social asset. Through the subject of antidotes, these paintings promote learning as a highly valued activity that is hierarchical in its essence and yet, at the same time, socially relevant, accessible, and attainable. This pop- ular humanistic perception of the practice of knowl- edge as an exalting activity is crystallized particularly in the Paris Kitdb al-dirygq through its visualization of physicians as sages mediating in a cosmic continuum delineated by reference to both celestial and earthly realms in creation. A comparison of this manuscript with its later counterpart in Vienna reveals an alter- native approach to representing the agents, process- es, and contexts of learning, possibly as a result of courtly involvement in the definition and production of its pictorial program. Together, the Paris and Vi- enna copies of the Kitdb al-dirydq epitomize two as- pects of the cultural endorsement of learning in the late Seljuq period. The illustrations of the Paris manuscript begin with an exceptional double frontispiece showing two seated figures each holding up a crescent moon with an at- tendant on either side, enclosed by two dragons and surrounded by four winged figures (fig. la-b).5 The two pages are nearly identical, differing only in a few details. The inscription, spread across the two pages, reads: "Its owner and scribe is the meekest of God's servants, be He praised, Muhammad, son of the for- tunate Abu'l-Fath, son of the rightly guided imam Abu'l-Hasan, son of the beneficent imam."6 The dou- ble frontispiece is followed by a second double-page composition. The inscription on the right-hand page states that the book is for the library of a certain Imam Abu'l-Fath Mahmud who, it appears from his patronymic, may well have been the nephew of the owner/scribe named on the frontispiece.7 The left- hand page introduces the work: "The Book of Anti- dotes of the virtuous physician Galen from the col- lection of the first discourse of the book of Galen on electuaries with the commentary of John the Gram-</page><page sequence="2">156 OYA PANCAROGLU Fig. la-b.

Ishak.' The Kitab al-diryaq, on the other hand, appears to be pseudepigraphic and probably the work of a later, perhaps a tenth-century, anonymous Arabic author who may have compiled the text from a variety sources without being too concerned about the accuracy of its historical components.10 In medieval Islam, phar- macology was a highly developed branch of medi- cine which was based to a large degree on Greek sources and, to a lesser degree, on Indian ones. Along with the translation of the principal reference works such as Dioscorides' De Materia Medica on simple drugs in the ninth and tenth centuries and new treatises produced by Islamic scholars based on assimilated and original findings, there was also considerable re- daction of a vast corpus of inherited pharmacologi- cal knowledge, not infrequently disseminated as pseud- epigraphic texts. In addition to descriptions of poisons (summ, pl. sumfitm) and their remedies compiled from the ancient sources, medieval Islamic physicians and pharmacists produced a number of original writings devoted specifically to toxicology that relied on both Greek and Indian sources. In most medical compen- dia, a chapter was devoted to poisons and antidotes, the latter holding a special status among the com- pound drugs not in the least because of the com- plexity of their composition.11 Popular interest in the subject of toxicology in particular is apparent from its inclusion in encyclo- pedias of the natural sciences, particularly those writ- ten in Persian between the eleventh and thirteenth</page><page sequence="3">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE KITAB AL-DIRYAQ 157 centuries and intended for a non-scientific audience. For example, in the Farrukhndma (Book of Auspicious- ness), a popular encyclopedia of cosmographical knowledge and various types of useful instruction written in 1185 by Abu Bakr al-Mutahhar Jamali Yaz- di for a vizier named Majd al-Dawla Ahmad b. Mascud, descriptions of poisons and antidotes as well as an- ecdotes related to their application constitute the sub- ject of one chapter.12 Thus, discussion of toxicology was not confined to literature for the specialist, but was part of general learned discourse, as a topic that interested laymen for whom handy descriptions of poisons, recipes of antidotes, and accounts of their application were offered in such compilations. The tenth-century physician Ibn Juljul's statement that antidotes are of great importance especially to trav- elers, rulers, and men of affairs since they are in great- est danger of being poisoned speaks for the popular consumption of this type of knowledge." The rea- son for producing a copy of the Kitdb al-dirydq for the library of a person outside of the medical profes- sion, in this case a member of the Shici religious class, may therefore be understood, at least in part, in the context of this popular and pragmatic interest in the wondrous curing effect of the successful antidote.14 The double frontispiece and title pages of the Paris Kitdb al-diryiq are followed by three illustrated pages on which the title of the work is given one more time (fig. 2a-c). These pages contain portraits of nine phy- sicians of antiquity (including Galen) whose contri- butions to the development of the antidote recipes is the subject of the text. The physicians, whose names are given above their portraits, are portrayed with the necessary attributes of learning (pencase, inkwell, bookstand, oil lamp, etc.) and, except for the cen- tral physician on each page, they are also depicted in the company of their student.15 The portraits are followed by a page containing the beginning of the text which introduces the nine physicians. This ex- tended pictorial introduction to the nine physicians, who are presented in the book as the historical he- roes of the antidote, visually anchors this text with regard to its putative sources. Although these depic- tions are usually referred to as "author portraits," they should not be perceived specifically as such. Galen, the alleged author of the text according to the title, is not distinguished in any way from his eight col- leagues, and John the Grammarian, the alleged com- mentator, does not figure at all in this assembly. Each one of these nine portraits, which depicts the physi- cian as a scholar and teacher in the process of re- cording or imparting his knowledge, functions as a link in a chain of transmission that includes his at- tentive student and, by extension, the reader who en- gages with the book. This clear indication of the gen- eration and transmission of knowledge at the very beginning of the Paris Kitdb al-dirydq sets the tone for the remainder of its pictorial program where these two themes are assimilated and explored in an ex- panded context. The first section of the Kitab al-dirydq chronicles the lives of the nine physicians, giving the number of years for each physician's life and career and out- lining the contributions of each to the evolution of the antidote recipes. This section concludes with three anecdotes attributed to the life of the physician An- dromachus the Younger (Andrumakhus al-Qarib al- CAhd) in which the applicational value of the anti- dotes is described. The Paris manuscript contains three paintings that illustrate the lives and contributions of the first three of the nine physicians. Originally, this number may have been four as there is a miss- ing folio in the segment about the physician Proklos (Afruqlus). Each of the three paintings illustrates a scene in which a physician is depicted in an activity related to the composition and preparation of the antidote. The first painting depicts the physician Androma- chus the Elder on horseback observing a youth who has just been bitten by a snake (fig. 3). The text ex- plains that Andromachus developed his antidote recipe from this encounter with this youth who had cured himself by eating leaves from a laurel tree depicted in botanical fashion behind him. The second paint- ing depicts the physician Herakleides (Abraqlidis) who, according to the text, had improved upon Androma- chus's recipe (fig. 4). This scene shows the physician, book in hand, supervising an assistant who is mea- suring out ingredients for the antidote on a scale. The scene appears to be set in the practice of the physician or in the shop of a pharmacist where pouches of medicinal substances hang from hooks. Herakleides is assisted by two apprentices and waited upon by three attendants shown standing behind his seat. The indoor setting is indicated by the doorway to the right occupied by a crouching sleeping groom. The third painting depicts the physician Philagrios (Aflaghuras) in the process of preparing his antidote</page><page sequence="4">158 OYA PANCAROGLU Fig. 2a-c. Portraits of the physicians.

He is shown indoors, perched over a stove, stirring the contents of a pan, while his assistant does his best to keep the fire going.

These three paintings accompanying, respective- ly, the accounts of the first three physicians' lives and works, function on one level as illustrations explicat- ing or enhancing the text. On another level, they appear to function independently of the text, in pic- torial relationship to each other, constituting a near- ly narrative progression of scenes that highlight the physician and the nature and context of his prac- Fig. 4.

Thus, the paintings take the viewer from an outdoor scene-the site of the discovery of an anti- dote-to the indoor measurement of the ingredients, and, finally, to the distribution of the antidote to com- mon folk. With each scene, the social context expands further and, within each scene, the primacy of the physician as the codifier and transmitter of the knowl- edge of antidotes is emphasized. This emphasis on the role and rank of the physician is further strength- ened by the series of epigrammatic portraits that immediately precede these three scenes. This sequence of paintings suggests the premise of a pyramidal social structure for learning that is occupied at the apex by the physician, in the middle by aspiring students, and at the bottom by common folk, thereby constructing a relationship between the scholarly and the non-scholarly segments of society which are differentiated from and, at the same time,</page><page sequence="6">160 OYA PANCARO GLU Fig. 5.

(Photo: Bibliotheque National de France, Paris) linked to each other by their varying degrees of knowl- edge and initiation. While primacy is given to the physician as the wise sage, the students' progress along the path of knowledge is acknowledged by way of their incorporation into the preliminary portraits. Common folk are also included for their recognition of the medical knowledge codified and dispensed by the physician. In this way, the paintings function not just as illustrations to the text but as a superimposed exposition on learning and its social structure. This social framework of the pursuit and practice of med- ical learning is given further treatment in the last three figural paintings of the Paris manuscript. These three paintings illustrate three anecdotes about the discovery and application of antidotes attributed to Andromachus the Younger. The first of the series depicts an incident involv- ing Andromachus's brother Tulunus, a land survey- Fig. 6. Tulunus discovers an antidote.

(Photo: Bibliotheque National de France, Paris) or in the service of the king (fig. 6). While out sur- veying land one day, Tulunus is bitten by a poison- ous snake. Feeling death overcoming him, he writes his will, hangs it on a nearby tree, and drinks his last cup of water from ajar. This drink immediately cures him. Surprised, he stirs the jar to find out what caused this healing and finds two snakes inside, as is depict- ed in the painting. The painting also includes An- dromachus, who is observing the discovery of the two snakes in the jar. The anecdote portrayed in the sec- ond painting takes place on Andromachus's estate (fig. 7). One day, Andromachus decides to pay a vis- it to his agricultural workers and has his servant bring them food and drinks. When the workmen discover a certain snake inside the water jar, they make a lep- er drink this water, which cures his affliction.16 The painting shows Andromachus and his servant in the upper left corner while the composition is taken up ?non.... ! :. .. . , .; . . . . .::: .:: .::.:. ::. ::.:. ::....... :: i jot i".:,.kJ',-" ... ... ;j ::+:: .: ?:  :i:: iii~ii:i:4igi )!

(Photo: Bibliothbque National de France, Paris) primarily by a scene of busy agricultural work. In the final painting the third anecdote related to Andro- machus is depicted (fig. 8). The incident takes place in the court of a prince. The prince's favorite slave, who is the envy of the court, has been given an over- dose of opium. While drugged and under house ar- rest, the slave is bitten by a snake, as a result of which he is revived from the opium-induced stupor. The painting depicts a garden pavilion that is occupied on the upper level by the oblivious prince and his court while, on the lower level, the improved condi- tion of the imprisoned slave is witnessed by an alert workman. These three illustrations of anecdotes shift the fo- cus away from the physician (although he is present in two of them as observer) to elaborate further on the variety of social and environmental settings in which the accidental or conventional application of Fig. 8.

(Photo: Bibliotheque National de France, Paris) antidotes takes place. The paintings, especially the last two, emphasize the social setting as much as the incident described in the anecdote. These settings further expand the social context of medical knowl- edge to include both agricultural workers and a roy- al court, thereby covering essentially the entire range of society. The knowledge of antidote recipes which are obtained in these settings is visually conveyed as an asset with widespread relevance, application, and effect, demonstrating the extent of the physicians' sphere of activity from which they derive their learn- ing. The nine portraits and subsequent six paintings of the Paris Kitab al-dirytq depict, via the subject of antidotes, the acquisition and application of knowl- edge as an occupation of paramount significance for society and as a pursuit anchored in the person of the physician who obtains, codifies, and, in turn, trans-</page><page sequence="8">162 OYA PANCAROGLU Fig. 9a-b.

The emphasis on the dissemina- tion of learning in the Paris Kitab al-diryaq is made apparent in the portraits of the nine physicians, most of which include a figure that can be identified as a scribe or student. In fact, representations of the trans- mission of knowledge between scholar and student are included in most of the extant illustrated manu- scripts from the early thirteenth century. The well- known frontispiece to the 1228 copy of Dioscorides' De Materia Medica (Istanbul, Topkapi Palace Library, Ahmet III 2127), for example, depicts two students holding books in their hands and dutifully approach- ing the scholar who approvingly summons them.17 The indispensability of the student from a represen- tation of the scholar can also be seen in similar com- positions consisting of teachers and student groups in early-thirteenth-century illustrated literary manu- scripts. The interest in visualizing the agents and processes of learning is perhaps most evident in the double frontispiece to the early-thirteenth-century copy of the Persian version of the animal fable book, Kalila wa Dimna (Istanbul, Topkapi Palace Library, Hazine 363) that explicitly renders the transmission and trans- lation of the stories of Bidpai (fig. 9 a-b). On the right-hand page, Nasr Allah Munshi, the translator of Kalila wa Dimna into Persian, is shown receiving the text as a book from an older scholar. They are accompanied by three scribes, who are equipped for the task at hand with penboxes and bookstands. On the left-hand page, the process of transmission is completed as Nasr Allah presents the book to his patron, the Ghaznavid Bahram Shah, surrounded by his courtly attendants. This pictorial emphasis on the agents, processes, and even tools of the transmission of knowledge in</page><page sequence="9">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE KITAB AL-DIRYAQ 163 the first half of the thirteenth century can be under- stood more fully in the context of new forms and attitudes in the exercise of knowledge during the period of the Seljuqs and their successors (late elev- enth to early thirteenth centuries). The well-known rise of the madrasa, for example, provided an insti- tutional locus where knowledge could be pursued as social capital. Among the learned civilian elite who held posts in the madrasas, the act of learning was regarded as a means of guaranteeing loyalty, service, and honor between teachers and students. Teaching and learning were seen as ritual processes that yield- ed benefit (f&amp;'ida), and knowledge was classified as a distinct form of blessing (baraka). The special bond between students and teachers was described with the concept of suhba (fellowship), implying loyalty on the part of the student and frequently expressed in terms of the experience of love. Students were often re- ferred to as muhibbitn (lovers), thus emphasizing the personal affiliation and devotion implied in ties of love. From this emic relationship, the student derived not only moral benefit but also moral identity.'8 In addition to the rise of the madrasa, the twelfth and thirteenth centuries also witnessed the institu- tionalization of Sufism into orders and a relatively new form of social organization known as futuwwa which functioned in the form of urban fraternities dedicated to the promotion of a chivalric code of behavior.19 Like the institution of the madrasa, both Sufi orders and futuwwa brotherhoods were centered on the relationship between master and disciple, pro- viding a useful framework for the creation and main- tenance of social associations across the various seg- ments of society. The fundamental system of hierarchy between masters and disciples, which was crucial to all three of these organizations, afforded personal stability and opportunity and gave clear new defini- tion to the processes of social initiation. It is against the background of this new emphasis on the exer- cise of knowledge as a social asset and of the accom- panying general interest in articulating social initia- tion by accentuating the relationship between teacher and student that these paintings of the transmission and practice of knowledge can be understood. This value accorded to learning was also empha- sized in medieval Islamic texts on ethics in which knowledge is posited as one of the two principal pre- requisites to the attainment of human perfection.20 Those who attain this rank of perfection are consid- ered to have realized their microcosmic potential as human beings in whom the cosmos is epitomized and who thereby occupy an intermediary status between the temporal and the universal realms of God's cre- ation. According to the philosopher Miskawayh, the perfect man "reaches the limit of his realm [which is] the beginning of the realm of angels. This is the highest rank possible for man. Here the existents are unified, and their beginnings become joined to their ends and vice-versa."21 Having reached this stage, man will "become an intermediary between the higher world and the lower."22 Miskawayh conceived of this intermediary status as being occupied either by proph- ets who receive divine revelation or by "complete philosophers" who receive heavenly inspiration and support for their endeavors. As implied by the title hakim, denoting both medical doctor and philosopher or sage, the physician was uniquely situated to be a candidate for the rank of the "complete philosopher." This cosmic ramification of the ultimate attainment of knowledge may provide the semantic justification for the choice of the frontispiece of the Paris Kitab al-diryaq (fig. la-b). That the frontispiece representation of two seated moon figures, each encircled by two dragons and sur- rounded by four winged celestial beings, establishes a cosmic connection for the book has been recog- nized in the scholarship from the outset. Bishr Fares, who first brought this manuscript to light in a mono- graph, saw in this frontispiece the memory of the ancient Mesopotamian cult of the moon god, Sin, who was occasionally associated with healing and sug- gested that this memory was preserved through the perpetuation of this cult by the planet-worshiping Sabians of Harran well into the Islamic period.23 For the intertwined dragons, Fares proposed a talisman- ic function akin to the frequent usage of snake and dragon reliefs on walls and gates and reinforced by the healing powers associated with snakes in ancient Mesopotamian and Greco-Roman beliefs.24 Although Fares aptly stressed the relevance of the various ele- ments in the composition of a talismanic nature to a text on poisons and antidotes, the main thrust of his analysis, albeit perceptive, was to discern in the ico- nography of the frontispiece traces of ancient Meso- potamian tradition without being too concerned about explaining why such elements reemerged or were revived in an established Islamic context on the eve of the thirteenth century. In an article devoted exclusively to the iconogra- phy of this frontispiece, Guitty Azarpay rightly pointed out that the moon figure and the intertwined drag- ons could also be perceived as a discrete representation</page><page sequence="10">164 OYA PANCAROGLU of the lunar eclipse.25 In Islamic celestial sciences, the eclipse of the sun and the moon were attributed to an invisible pseudo-planet, al-jawzahr, correspond- ing to the two nodes of the moon's orbit and con- ceived of as a bipartite dragon temporarily "devour- ing" the sun or the moon.26 Along with the rise of anthropomorphic celestial imagery in the second half of the twelfth century from Khurasan to Anatolia, depictions of al-jawzahr menacing a personification of the sun or the moon became particularly preva- lent in decorative programs of objects, either alone or in combination with the other seven planet fig- ures. Azarpay, however, like Fares, was interested primarily in tracing the Mesopotamian antecedents of this iconography and only offered, as a possible explanation for the frontispiece's subject matter, the occurrence of a partial solar eclipse around the time of the completion of the manuscript. In addition to avoiding the basic question of why a representation of the lunar eclipse might be chosen to refer to a solar eclipse, Azarpay's restrictive analysis explicitly precluded a correlation between the iconography of the frontispiece and either the content of the text or the remainder of the pictorial program of the manu- script. The analyses of both scholars, preoccupied as they were with the ancient sources of the imagery, none- theless provide a number of valuable observations which suggest that the frontispiece may be under- stood more completely if it is acknowledged to be a polysemic representation both in itself and in rela- tionship to the overall pictorial program and the text. Thus, on an immediate level, as both Fares and Az- arpay noted, the choice of the moon figure may well have had specific regional significance as this image was frequently depicted on coins, architecture, and metalwork particularly in the Jazira between the mid twelfth and early thirteenth centuries. The memory of the pagan cult of Sin, the moon god, in Harran is indeed attested by medieval Islamic writers even af- ter Sabian practices had become extinct in that city.27 On the other hand, there is no evidence to link the resurgence of the moon figure directly with any new impetus provided by such a memory specifically around the middle of the twelfth century. Indirectly, it may perhaps be explained as part and parcel of the more widespread emergence of cosmographical imagery across the eastern Islamic world at that par- ticular time which emphasized regionally meaning- ful, even if latent, celestial imagery. Be that as it may, simply ascribing the moon figures of the frontispiece to regional tradition does little to explain their func- tion in this particular manuscript. Interpretation of the intertwined dragons around the moon figures as the ecliptic al-jawzahr yields an- other level of potential meaning which need not be connected to the actual occurrence of an eclipse, solar or lunar, as Azarpay had proposed, but which may be semantically related to the contents of the manu- script. Personifications of the sun or the moon in combination with al-jawzahr can, in many cases, be read as images of the triumph of light over darkness or good over evil, as the two "planets" are always seen to emerge unscathed from their temporary eclipse by the "dragon."28 As an image of triumph which reso- nated with images of kingship, the representation of dragons subdued by a human figure also found its way to the decoration of city gates where they natu- rally acquired talismanic connotations.29 This auspi- cious indication of celestial victory, reinforced by the presence of the winged figures, in the beginning of the Paris Kitab al-dirydq manuscript may have been intended to provide a cosmic parallel to the basic theme of the text defined by the triumph of anti- dotes over poison, especially those from snakes. The idea of this semantic parallel between the sub- ject matter of the frontispiece and the subject mat- ter of the text, which was also hinted at in passing by Fares, merits further consideration. Medieval Islam- ic medicine, based largely on Galenic pathology, as- cribed ailments of the body to a disturbance in the equilibrium (ictidal) of the four humors (akhldt: blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile), each of which corresponded to one of the four sublunar elements (arkan: air, water, fire, and earth) and embodied four qualities or temperaments.30 Because of their respec- tive correspondences, the humors were also called "daughters of the elements" (banat al-arkdn). Devia- tion from the equilibrium was attributed to a num- ber of such external "non-naturals" as abnormalities in diet and sleep or environmental factors including changes in climate, miasma, and even astral influ- ence. Similarly, the action of poisons in the body was explained as an upset of the humors.3" The role of the physician was to reinstate the humoral equilibri- um by his understanding of the correspondences be- tween the humors and external forces. In this con- nection, the choice of the triumphant moon figure may be interpreted as a device signaling the extent of the sublunar domain of creation in which the four</page><page sequence="11">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE KITAB AL-DIRYAQ 165 elements give rise to the three kingdoms (animal, vegetal, and mineral). The physician achieves his goal by negotiating the forces of this sublunar domain and administering the necessary remedy extracted from the natural world of the three kingdoms. It is per- haps not entirely coincidental that the moon figures of the frontispiece are surrounded by four winged figures which may have been intended to represent the four elements and, by extension, their four hu- moral counterparts. Taking this idea further, the four knots formed by the two dragons may also be read as a reinforcement of this number symbolism. On the basis of the foregoing, therefore, it is pos- sible to offer two interrelated meanings for the fron- tispiece to this manuscript. As the image of triumph over the eclipse dragon, the moon figure functions as a cosmic parallel to the power of antidotes to over- come the effect of poisons, particularly snake ven- om. As a representation defining the extent of the sublunar realm in which human well-being depends on the balance of the humors and the elements, the moon figure also provides a cosmic context for the physician's purpose and practice as mediator. In both cases, the frontispiece situates the textual and picto- rial contents of the manuscript in a framework de- fined by the concept of a cosmic continuum between the temporal and celestial realms of creation. The physicians, whose portraits follow the frontispiece, oc- cupy a pivotal position in that continuum by virtue of their consummate learning which both allows them to negotiate a balance between bodily and external forces and grants them an intermediary rank between the universal and the temporal realms. And as inter- mediaries, the nine physicians are not only codifiers and rationalizers of medical knowledge which they transmit to their students but also exemplary human beings in the natural world. This natural world which is the source of the antidotes is the setting of the physicians' progression from mere human existence- in which knowledge of antidotes has application and is disseminated-to human perfection, the ultimate destination of the pursuit of knowledge, conferring microcosmic status to the human individual. Thus, the pictorial program of the manuscript, when read consecutively from the initial moon figures, through the physician portraits, and into extended social set- tings, delineates a cosmic hierarchy articulated by the degrees of initiation into knowledge of the interrela- tion of forces and, in this case, of antidotes. The idea of a cosmic continuum communicated by the pictorial program of the Paris Kitab al-diryaq also suggests the possibility of another, esoteric, lev- el of meaning. Based largely on late-antique forms of Greek medical knowledge which contained cur- rents of occult practices and beliefs, medieval Islam- ic medical practice likewise included such syncretis- tic aspects which were not strictly peripheral to the mainstream discipline.32 Discourse on pharmacolo- gy and toxicology, in particular, contained ideas in- fused with late-antique concepts of magic based on the Hermetic notion of a unified cosmos of interde- pendent forces.33 Besides the popular interest in its practical aspects, the subject of toxicology especially intersected with the Islamic occult sciences immersed in Hermeticism, such as alchemy. These occult sci- ences were predicated on the understanding of a cos- mic "sympathy" between the celestial and the terres- trial, spirit and matter, or the hidden and the seen, and aimed to gain intellectual and spiritual mastery of the cosmos by tapping into the forces relevant to the task at hand. An Arabic text on the poisons of snakes and other venomous creatures attributed to Hermes translated or compiled from the Greek prob- ably in the ninth century and in circulation through the medieval period, reveals the affiliation between toxicology and the Hermetic notions of sympathies.34 Specifically, the belief in the connection between the terrestrial and the celestial informed the description of snakes, their venom, and antidotes which were systematized in this text according to their correspon- dence to the twelve constellations of the Zodiac and the seven planets. The relationship between toxicol- ogy and the other occult sciences is also evinced by the attribution of one of the earliest Islamic works devoted exclusively to the subject of toxicology, the Kitab al-sumfim (Book of Poisons) to Jabir b. Hayyan, the putative eighth- or ninth-century author of a large body of Hermetic alchemical literature.35 An esoteric, or Hermetic, interpretation of the cosmic continuum suggested by the pictorial program of the Paris Kitab al-diryaq is supported by two obser- vations. As a pseudepigraphic Arabic text which pur- ports to have been written by Galen and commented on by the sixth-century Greek Christian theologian and literary scholar, John the Grammarian (Philopo- nus) of Alexandria, the Kitdb al-dirytq is probably a descendant of the medico-magical compilations of late-antique authors in cities such as Alexandria and Harran that constituted centers of Hermetic thought.36 Furthermore, the apparently Shi'i affiliation of the</page><page sequence="12">166 OYA PANCAROGLU scribe and owner of the manuscript points to a so- cioreligious context that may have been favorably disposed to an esoteric interpretation of the text and its pictorial program. The Jabirean corpus is believed to be the work largely of later Ismacili authors and Jabir's name was closely associated with Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth imam, who was also held to be the author of a number of alchemical treatises.37 Moreover, Ismacili esotericism also propounded the idea of a continuum between the microcosm and the macro- cosm which was formulated especially by the Breth- ren of Purity (Ikhwan al-Safa') in the tenth century.38 The ideas conveyed by the complete pictorial pro- gram of the Paris Kitab al-diryaq is more than the sum of its parts. The illustrations were conceived with an eye toward conveying the hierarchical nature of cre- ation and the singular role of humankind in appre- hending and manipulating it. Textually, the Kitab al- diryaq can be situated at the intersection of popular and esoteric interest in toxicology, which had its roots in the late-antique period and which was absorbed into an Islamic context early on, along with the trans- mission of both medical and occult knowledge. The illustrated manuscript in Paris not only represents the enduring popularity of such pseudepigraphic texts around 1200, but, more significantly, also reflects, through its pictorial program, a distinct emphasis on the idea of a continuous and interdependent creation which humankind is uniquely able to comprehend and ascend through the acquisition and dissemina- tion of learning. The sequence of paintings suggests that in the twelfth century the artist and his audi- ence were immersed in and motivated by the visual and literary popularization of the interrelated notions of a cosmic continuum and of man's microcosmic potential and that they subscribed to the articulation of knowledge as a social asset. Although it is possible that the Paris manuscript may have been destined specifically for an Ismacili audience and designed, therefore, to communicate on an esoteric level as well, the polysemy of the pictorial program would have nonetheless rendered it equally accessible and mean- ingful to a wider audience of learned individuals. The continuing interest in copying the Kitab al- diryaq as an illustrated manuscript into the thirteenth century is evident in the second copy of this text, now in Vienna, and usually dated to the second quarter of the century. Although similarly furnished with an elaborate frontispiece, portraits of the physicians, and several paintings accompanying the text, the pictori- al program of the Vienna manuscript conveys a sig- nificantly different approach to the illustration of the text that seems to be designed for a distinct, proba- bly courtly, audience. Specifically, it displays an al- ternative vision for the cultural sanction of learning in visual culture which did not subscribe to a polyse- mic conceptualization of the themes offered by the text as with the Paris manuscript, but instead favored a discrete and circumscribed definition of the picto- rial program. In its present state, the Vienna Kitaib al-diryaq is introduced by a frontispiece depicting a lively court scene revolving around the person of the prince who is surrounded by numerous attendants, one of whom is grilling meat before his patron (fig. 10). Just be- hind the royal pavilion, gardeners can be seen tend- ing to their work and, beyond them, several figures on horseback are engaged in hunting. In the fore- Fig. 10. Frontispiece.

The first two folios are missing, leaving open the possibility that the manuscript may have originally had a double frontispiece. This elaborate representation of activities, both ceremonial and mundane, epitomizing aspects of medieval Islamic pal- ace life at the outset of the manuscript provides a semantic context that is clearly royal and distinctly different from the celestial one seen in the Paris manuscript. As one of the earliest extant manuscripts to incorporate exclusively royal imagery into its fron- tispiece, the Vienna Kitdb al-dirya-q is representative of a pictorial alternative to other early-thirteenth- century manuscripts, scientific or literary, which were typically introduced by author portraits. Although there is no information in the manuscript in its present state about the patron or the artist/scribe of this V2A Fig. 11. Portraits of the physicians. Kitab al-diryaq, mid thirteenth century. Vienna, Nationalbibliothek, A.F. 10, fol. 3b. (Photo: Bildarchiv, Osterreichische Nationalbibliothek, Vienna) manuscript, the subject of the frontispiece offers the strong possibility of courtly patronage. The subsequent page in the manuscript contains the portraits of the nine physicians of antiquity and the introduction to the text (fig. 11). In contrast to the Paris manuscript where the portraits of the nine are spread over three pages, here the depictions are reduced to an almost emblematic composition on a single page. The physicians hold books in their hands but the matrix-like arrangement precludes the inclu- sion of students and, therefore, also the idea of the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. Taken together, the frontispiece and the portraits in the Vienna Kitab al-diryaq constitute a notably different direction to the representation of learning in terms of the royal iconography dominat- ing the opening of the book, the minimization of the space allotted to the physicians' portraits, and the simplification of the composition of those por- traits. The reductive approach to the portraits is echoed in the subsequent paintings of the manuscript, re- vealing a general simplification and even standard- ization of the imagery, especially when compared with the Paris manuscript. For example, the painting of Philagrios preparing his antidote in the Paris manu- script is conceived as taking place indoors with vari- ous customers eagerly awaiting the concoction about to be served by the physician (fig. 5). The same scene in the Vienna manuscript is set outdoors, lacks any onlookers, and consists basically of the physician su- pervising his assistant as he stirs the contents of a cauldron (fig. 12). In fact, unlike the nearly narra- tive progression of scenes in different settings dis- cerned in the Paris manuscript, this basic composi- tion of the physician and his assistant before a cauldron, always set outdoors, is repeated three times in the Vienna manuscript without major variations.39 In addition to this standardization of imagery in the paintings showing the physicians preparing their re- spective antidotes, depictions of the three anecdotes related to Andromachus the Younger are also signif- icantly less elaborate than their counterparts in the Paris manuscript. The painting of the snake-bitten slave, for example, excludes the explicit representa- tion of the courtly context and conveys just the inci- dent described in the text (fig. 13). This standardization and simplification of imagery communicating the nature and context of the physi- cian's practice reinforce the notion of an alternative</page><page sequence="14">168 OYA PANCAROGLU .....................................   i,...N ..............

The artist of the Vienna Kitab al-diryaq was apparently less interested in conveying the variety of contexts, so- cial and physical, in which the knowledge of anti- dotes is obtained and disseminated. Indeed, the only painting in the manuscript invested with an elabo- rate setting is the frontispiece which is easily the most elaborate representation of court life from medieval Islam. Whereas the sequence of paintings in the Par- is manuscript appears to have been coordinated specifically to delineate the temporal implications and cosmological ramifications of learning, the pictorial program of the Vienna manuscript is weighted in the frontispiece in which aspects of royal prerogative are represented. The conspicuous display of a courtly environment in the beginning of the Vienna manuscript may be ...X.:%.. ................. :...... ....: ..:. . ..., .:...::..:. { . ,...:.&lt; &lt;  : . ....:: ...:o . ......... .. ........... ....... a  &lt; *::  1 " ..-. :v ,  &lt; v,: : i : ... ......... a..... .. .. ...,..... .... . ......:  :: :':: ... &gt; ::: " :  .

Although the anonym- ity of the manuscript's owner and audience makes this characterization tentative, it is nonetheless con- gruous with the larger pattern of royal sponsorship of learning, especially in the form of madrasas, among the ruling military classes of the Seljuq successor states. It has been argued that the endowment of these in- stitutions by the ruling military classes was as much a charitable activity as it was a religiopolitical strategy for establishing crucial bonds with the learned civil- ian elite through the distribution of stipendiary posts.40 Aside from appropriating the prestige of the schol- arly milieus for magnifying their status and image in the competitive environment of the politically frag- mented and multicentered lands of the former Sel- juq empire, rulers in the successor states were also</page><page sequence="15">ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE KITAB AL-DIRYAQ 169 exhorted, in ethical writings, to align themselves with learning. In mirrors for princes, which distilled the ethical exigencies of ideal kingship into the pragmatic manuals of conduct, the acquisition of knowledge was posited as a distinct characteristic of the would-be ideal, or just, ruler.41 Thus, on both the public and the individual level, the assertion of royal affiliation with learning became a key factor in the promotion and maintenance of the proper kingly and courtly image. In the context of this explicit and often overt at- tempt to establish links with the learned segments of society, the pictorial expression of royal affiliation with the agents and processes of knowledge also emerged as part of some manuscript illustration in the early thirteenth century. In the frontispiece to the Kalla wa Dimna manuscript discussed earlier, for example, the detailed depiction of the transmission of the text culminates visually in the person of the king who is shown receiving the translated text (fig. 9 a-b). In other manuscripts, representations of au- thors or their students were excluded altogether from the composition of the frontispieces, giving way to exclusively royal imagery. Such is the case particular- ly with five of the six extant frontispieces to an orig- inally twenty-volume copy of the Kita-b al-aghdni (Book of Songs), dating from between 1217 and 1219.42 These paintings which depict the ruler, quite possi- bly the ata-beg Badr al-Din Lu'lu' of Mosul, in various guises of kingship, are very much in keeping with the tenor of the Vienna Kitab al-diryiq frontispiece, even if not as detailed. The evidence provided by extant manuscripts sug- gests that, in the first half of the thirteenth century, depictions of rulers, or patrons, and scholars in their respective environments constituted the majority of frontispieces. While the frontispiece and the subse- quent painting in the 1228 manuscript of De Materia Medica both depicted the theme of knowledge trans- mission exclusively, for example, the frontispieces of the Kitdb al-aghan- gave primacy to displays of the royal theme. Only in the Kalla wa Dimna frontispiece was a true equilibrium achieved between the repre- sentations of the scholar and the patron, thanks to the explicit depiction of textual transmission. It is, of course, entirely possible that the frontispiece of the Vienna Kitzb al-diryiq was also once part of a double-page composition in which the courtly scene was complemented on the opposite page by a repre- sentation of learning. Compositionally, however, the extant painting showing a self-contained palace brim- ming with activities precludes the possibility that such a double-page frontispiece could have conveyed a unified scene of the transmission of knowledge, as is the case with the Kalila wa Dimna frontispiece. In fact, the double frontispiece to a copy of al-Hariri's Maqdma-t (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, arabe 5847) dated 634 (1237) with the portrait of the author on the left and of the patron on the right, each with his respective audience, reveals that the inclusion of both scholar and patron in a single double-page composi- tion did not necessarily amount to a representation of knowledge transmission.43 Rather, these constitute two parallel but discrete images, creating the net ef- fect of visually equating the image of a ruler holding audience in his court with that of the author recit- ing his work. The various configurations of the scholar and pa- tron in early-thirteenth-century frontispiece compo- sitions communicated the idea of royal affiliation with learning by visually linking, associating, or equating the two parties. By the end of the thirteenth centu- ry, but especially at the beginning of the fourteenth century, such configurations gave way to a visual ap- propriation of the scholar by the ruler. This is evi- dent, for example, in the frontispiece of the 1290 manuscript of the Ta'rWkh-iJahdn-gusha of 'Ala al-Din 'Ata Malik Juvayni (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, suppl. pers. 205) where the author is visually mar- ginalized with respect to the patron (either Hulagu or Amir Arghun) as well as his royal horse and groom.44 The domination of the royal theme is visi- ble even in the frontispiece of the 1287 copy of the Rasa'il of the Brethren of Purity (Istanbul, Silleymaniye Library, Esad Efendi, 3638) where the scholars, though prominently depicted, are contextualized in a court- like setting complete with attendants wielding fly whisks.45 The sequence of paintings in the Vienna Kitab al- dirydq, with its apparent affirmation of learning for the purposes of courtly prestige and numerous yet rather conventionalized representations of the prac- tice of learning, provides a profile of the semantic directions operative in manuscript illustration towards the middle of the thirteenth century and, at the same time, foreshadows the outcome of those directions at the end of the century. This apparent semantic transformation in the conceptualization of the fron- tispiece towards the end of the thirteenth century is not necessarily symptomatic of a diminishing inter-</page><page sequence="16">170 OYA PANCAROGLU est in the agents and processes of learning as such (since depictions of learning did not actually dissi- pate) but possibly an indication of an increasing con- cern for the assertion of royal prerogative vis-a-vis learning. The rise of court workshops probably had a role in this change; so did questions of dynastic legitimacy, especially in Mongol Iran. It is important to recognize, however, that the seeds of this shift towards the assertion of royal precedence in frontis- pieces were already sown in the early thirteenth cen- tury in tandem with both pragmatic and ethical asso- ciation of kingship with learning. Sociopolitical realignments brought about by the consolidation and division of the post-Seljuq world into the Mamluk and Mongol polities after 1250 could only have hastened such a shift in pictorial emphasis. On the other hand, it is important to bear in mind that while court pro- duction appears to have favored and developed spe- cific types of imagery relating to rulership in the il- lustration of manuscripts in the thirteenth century, these pictorial programs nonetheless retained inven- tive qualities that preceded the remarkable flower- ing of courtly illustrated manuscripts of the fourteenth century. The two manuscripts of the Kitab al-dirydq, separated in time by less than fifty years, are differentiated from each other by their approaches to the visual valida- tion of learning, defined by their distinct framing of the text in view of their respective audiences. Whereas the approach in the Vienna manuscript can be char- acterized as an appropriation and abridgment of the themes of learning in return for amplifying the pres- tige of the royal image, the program of the Paris manuscript engages with the subject of the text on more than one level. It conveys the relevance of the pursuit of knowledge for society, underscores the pivotal role of the physician as mediator, and projects its visual and textual contents onto the framework of a cosmic continuum with possibly esoteric connota- tions. The Paris KitaTb al-dirydq is a true milestone not just because it stands at the beginning of a long tra- dition of illustrated manuscripts but especially because it is one of the most complete testaments to the in- tellectually conceived and popularly disseminated visual humanism of the late Seljuq period. The Oriental Institute Oxford, England NOTES 1. The Arabic term dirya-q (or tiryaq) was derived from the Greek theriaka, or theriac, specifically an antidote to the bite or sting of a wild animal. As such, it was a particular type of antidote but, in time, it lost its specific meaning and the distinction between theriac and antidote became blurred. For a history of the theriac in ancient and medieval times, see Gilbert Watson, Theriac and Mithridatium: A Study in Therapeutics (London: Wellcome Historical Medical Library, 1966). Because the Kitab al-dirydq also includes references to recipes that are not theriac in the strict sense of the term, the less restrictive term "antidote" will be used in this essay. 2.

An Iranian origin for both manuscripts was first proposed by A. S. Melikian-Chirvani ("Trois manuscrits de l'Iran seld- joukide," Arts Asiatiques 16 [1967]: 3-51), who did not al- together deny the possibility of an Artuqid (i.e., Jaziran) provenance. For the Vienna manuscript, Kurt Holter of- fered Mosul as the likeliest location, and Bishr Fares at- tributed the Paris manuscript to the "School of Baghdad." Richard Ettinghausen accepted the Mosul attribution for the Vienna manuscript and leaned towards the possibility of the Jazira for the Paris manuscript (Arab Painting [Geneva: Skira, 1962], pp. 86 and 92). More recently, the likelihood of a Jaziran provenance for both manuscripts has been strengthened; Nahla Nassar, "Saljuq or Byzantine: Two Related Styles of Jaziran Miniature Painting," in The Art of Syria and the Jazira, 1100-1250, ed.

Hermeticism, as a system of beliefs and practices, grew out of theological, philosophi- cal, and occult writings of late antiquity attributed to the mythical Hermes Trismegistos (Hermes the Thrice-Great- est; a product of the joint cult of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth in Hellenistic Egypt) who, in Islam, was known as Hirmis and identified with the Qur'anic prophet Idris.

Plessner, "Hermes Trismegistus and Arab Science," Stu- dia Islamica 2 (1954): 45-60; Pierre Lory, "Hermes/Idris, prophete et sage dans la tradition islamique," in Presence d'Hermis Trismegiste, ed.

The two figures portrayed in this frontispiece have also been identified as representing al-Hariri, the author of the ear- ly-twelfth-century Maqamazt, and his predecessor in the genre, the tenth-century author al-Hamadhani; see Oleg Grabar, The Illustrations of the Maqamat (Chicago: University of Chi- cago Press, 1984), pp. 20-23. The identification of both fig- ures as authors is doubtful since the figure on the right- hand page is depicted in princely guise as conveyed by his fur-brimmed headdress, cup, and static frontal pose-typi- cal elements in late-twelfth- and early-thirteenth-century images of kingship. This is in contrast to the figure on the left-hand page whose turban, gesturing hand, and three- quarter pose epitomize contemporary portraits of the scholar engaged with his audience.
