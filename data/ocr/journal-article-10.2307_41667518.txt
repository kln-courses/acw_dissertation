JENSON 132</page><page sequence="2">Although the spectacular ancient sites of Middle America - Teotihuacan, Monte Alban, Chichen Itza, Tikal, Copan, Palenque, and La Venta - have been given a great deal of attention, the prehistory of this area of high civilization has not yet been reconstructed in detail. Several generations of specialists have pieced together only a skeleton outline of Middle American history which fits these well known ceremonial centers into a framework of sequential events and historical interrelationships. That history is at present grossly divided into three stages: Pre-Classic, Classic and Post-Classic. The Classic period, with a general flores- cence in arts and sciences, is epitomized by the Maya civilization in the southern half of Middle America, between the third and ninth centuries of our era. This was preceded by a long " 'formative" stage of develop- ment, through the first two thousand years before Christ, called the Pre-Classic period. Its highlight was the Olmec culture, centered in the southern Gulf Coast of Mexico. The Classic period was succeeded by a Post-Classic stage lasting up to the arrival of Cortez, early in the sixteenth century, and best known from the Aztecs, who lived in the northern half of Middle America. Though the broad lines of pre-Cortesian his- tory are coming to light, there remain a number of major gaps, perplexing problems and, no doubt, fas- cinating discoveries yet to be made. Hundreds of im- portant sites are insufficiently explored or entirely un- excavated. One important question is how the Classic civiliza- tions of Middle America began. An increasingly popu- lar hypothesis is that the Olmecs of southern Veracruz and western Tabasco were responsible for the coales- cence of the religious, intellectual and artistic founda- tions of the brilliant civilizations which followed. The Olmec culture has been dated with some confidence between the ninth and fifth centuries b.c., a period conventionally called Middle Pre-Classic. This culture is best known to us through its art style as expressed in stone sculpture, both monumental and portable. The powerfully conceived colossal stone heads of La Venta, San Lorenzo and Tres Zapotes are among the greatest examples of the stone carver's art in the New World (Figure 1). The Olmec art style was also adapted to miniature sculptures of jade and other fine-grained stone. A dominant motif of Olmec art, in addition to the prevalent " 'baby-face" figures, is a kind of "were- jaguar" with a snarling mouth that droops to scroll-like corners (Figure 2). [For a dis- cussion of some aspects of the Olmec art style, see the article by Agustín Delgado in our Spring issue. - Ed.] Several questions concerning the Olmecs are still unanswered : What was the origin and inspiration for the developed Olmec art style? Where was the source of Olmec civilization ? What was the geographic dis- tribution of the Olmec people? The late artist and archaeologist, Miguel Covarrubias, believed that the Olmecs originated in Guerrero, on the west coast of Mexico. He and a few other scholars thought that cer- tain Olmec motifs and concepts were the result of transpacific stimulus from eastern Asia. Most archaeol- ogists, however, favor the region of Veracruz and Tabasco - where the culture reached its height - for the origin of Olmec civilization. Large, non-portable Olmec sculpture has been thought to be fairly well confined to the Gulf Coast of Mexico, though stone celts, figurines and masks of Olmec style were known to be widely distributed in Middle America. A fine Olmec jade carving found at El Baul on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala was the subject of an article by Edwin Shook in Archaeol- ogy 9 (1956) 260-262. Two stray occurrences of pure Olmec-style petroglyphs on large boulders are also known on the southern Pacific Coast: one at San Isidro Piedra Parada in Guatemala, near the Mexican border, and the other at Chalchuapa in El Salvador, near the border of Guatemala. Here we shall focus attention on the possible role of the southern Pacific Coast in the development of Olmec stone sculpture. A site on the Monte Alto estate in the Department of Escuintla, in the center of the Guatemalan south coast and only twenty miles from the Pacific Ocean, has a group of six impressive boulder sculptures whose monumental size and sty- listic qualities have not been generally appreciated. In the carving of these sculptures, which lie ex- posed on the alluvial plain, the original contours of the boulders from which they were made are essen- tially unaltered. All of them evince a definite relation- ship to the Olmec art style, although they are in a class apart. Five of the monuments are roughly grouped in a north-south row (see plan) , a fact which implies that they are contemporaneous, although three distinct types of sculpture are here represented. Two of the boulders are carved into colossal human heads (Fig- ures 3-6), one has a jaguar monster mask carved on it (Figures 7-8; Figure 9 shows a comparable jaguar mask) and three are fashioned into rotund human shapes (Figures 10-12). The Monte Alto stone sculptures were first noted in Guatemalan publications in 1938. The most easily available reference, however, is an article by Francis B. Richardson in The Maya and Their Neighbors (New York 1940) 396-397; plate 18. Only four of the sculptures (Monuments 1-4) are illustrated, but it is likely that the author was aware of all six. To our knowledge, Monuments 5 and 6 have not previously 133</page><page sequence="3">3. Colossal stone head, Monument 1 at Monte Alto, Pa- cific Coast of Guatemala. Height 4 ft. 8 in. 4. Side view of Monument 1, Monte Alto. Originally it must have rested in a nearly vertical position. BOULDER SCULPTURE continued been illustrated. Richardson's comments on the sty- listic associations of the Monte Alto monuments are perceptive, although he erroneously states that they have no association with architecture. Since 1940 sev- eral archaeologists have visited Monte Alto and have made sketch maps and pottery collections. Two of these, Edwin Shook and S. W. Miles, have kindly given us access to their field notes. During 1963 the authors were excavating the site of Bilbao, in the vicinity of Monte Alto. The major occupation at Bilbao was in the Classic stage, but it also has Pre-Classic remains (Figure 13). One day we visited Monte Alto and were immediately im- pressed with the importance of this site as a Pre- Classic manifestation. Later, after securing permission from the landowner, Sr. Felipe Antonio Girón, we returned on two successive days with a small crew of workmen in order to map the site, collect a surface sample of pottery and clear the monuments for pho- tography. Since the time when Richardson photo- graphed Monuments 1-4 they had again been partly covered by earth. In contrast to Bilbao, which is on the edge of a piedmont zone, about thirteen hundred feet above sea level, Monte Alto lies on the fertile alluvial plain where the elevation drops to five hundred feet. It was probably in a transitional rain forest-savanna zone, though today much of the region is cleared and planted 134</page><page sequence="4">SOUTHEASTERN MIDDLE AMERICA (southern Mex- ico, Guatemala, El Salvador and western Honduras), lo- cating sites discussed in the article. Stippled zones repre- sent highland country above the 2000-foot contour line. to cotton. As the land here has a prevailing slope of over two feet per hundred feet, rapid water runoff probably prevented greater accumulation of soil around the monuments during the centuries. Monte Alto is a large site, extending about 1250 yards from north to south and about 950 yards from east to west. It has at least ten or eleven eroded earthen pyramids, which are irregularly spaced in two parallel rows enclosing a long plaza and are oriented generally northeast-southwest. (A similar grouping and orienta- tion are common on the Pre-Classic mounds at Ka- minaljuyu and other early sites in the Guatemalan highlands.) The highest mound rises about ten yards above the surrounding terrain. There may have been a long, low platform on the east edge of the site, op- posite the line of sculptures, but the topography of this area is obscured as a result of years of cultivation. The pyramids which lie to the south and west, pres- ently covered with dense brush and trees, could not be as carefully surveyed as the others, and we may not have located all the mounds. Only the monuments and Pyramid 1 are actually on the land of finca Monte Alto; the rest of the site extends across two other plantations. The sculptures are carved from medium-grained, dark gray boulders (probably porphyritic basalt, which is available in the vicinity). The two colossal heads, Monuments 1 and 2, lie about 220 yards apart and are the northernmost of the carved boulders. Monuments 2-6 form an approximate north-south row extending 105 yards. Monument 3 is the jaguar monster mask, while the others are rotund human figures. Arrows on the plan indicate the direction toward which each monument faces. The spacing of the sculptures sug- gests that others may still lie buried in the gaps. The two colossal heads, shown in front and side view in Figures 3-6, are pecked and shaped from large round boulders ; only the face halves of these are care- fully finished. The heads are bald and have closed eyes, possibly representing dead - perhaps sacrificed - individuals. Incised lines underscore the closed lids; in profile the brows are seen to slope toward the nose, imparting a vaguely Mongoloid look. An inverted V-groove marks off the nose and mouth from the cheeks - a feature also found on many Olmec stone mask carvings. The closed lips are thick, the noses wide and flat, with a suggestion of nostrils at the outer corners. Perforated discs adorn the ears. The famous Olmec colossal heads from the Gulf Coast of Mexico differ somewhat in style from the Monte Alto heads, especially in the representation of the eyes. Also they all wear headgear resembling a helmet with a strap under the chin. But the repre- sentation of ears on some of the Olmec heads is sim- ilar to that on the Monte Alto heads, and some of the earplugs are also comparable. Eleven of these Olmec heads are at present known from the Gulf Coast: one from near the Tres Zapotes mound complex in Vera- cruz, now at Santiago Tuxtla (see Figure 1) ; a second still in situ at Tres Zapotes ; five stone heads from San Lorenzo, Veracruz (four have been moved to the re- gional museum at Jalapa and one is at the National Museum in Mexico City) ; and four colossal heads from La Venta, Tabasco, which have all been trans- ported to the regional museum at Villahermosa. The largest of the Olmec heads is over nine feet high and the smallest is five feet, four inches high, and this is eight inches bigger than the larger head at Monte Alto. Monument 3 at Monte Alto (see Figures 7-8) is unique at that site. As a stylistic motif the jaguar mask is rather widespread in late Middle Pre-Classic and Late Pre-Classic phases at Olmec-influenced sites, and Monument 3 is unquestionably Olmecoid, or 135</page><page sequence="5">5.

Note the closed eye marked by heavily incised lines. BOULDER SCULPTURE continued Olmec-derived. It stems from the Middle Pre-Classic Olmec were-jaguar motif (see Figure 2) but most closely resembles the Late Pre-Classic stucco jaguar masks on the E-VII-sub pyramid at Uaxactun, Guate- mala. There are a number of related variations of Olmecoid feline monsters, all probably derived from the Olmec were-jaguar. Some, including the Monte Alto example, have scrolls over the eyes or in place of eyes, but typically the eyes are rectangular with rounded corners. The nose is broad and squat, with nostrils at the outer corners. Characteristically the upper lip is highly arched and extremely everted, though on the jaguar mask of Monte Alto it gives the false impres- sion of being a lip or nose plug. Possibly the exposed gum is shown, if not the projecting lip itself. Scrolls are carved at the outer corners of the mouth and dec- orative scroll-plumes adorn the cheeks. The ear orna- ments are rounded rectangles with curved plumes attached. Stylistically related is the jaguar mask in high relief at the top of Stela D at Tres Zapotes, which has a highly arched lip and cheek scrolls. A number of Late Pre-Classic stelae at Izapa on the Pacific coast of Chiapas represent this monster, usually in profile and in bas-relief. At Kaminaljuyu, near Guatemala City, the jaguar monster is represented in the same manner as on the Izapa examples (see Figure 9). Even in profile the similar treatment of features is clear. Besides these examples in relief, there are several 136</page><page sequence="6">PLAN OF MONTE ALTO, Dept. of Escuintla, Guatemala (14° 14' north latitude, 90° 56' west longitude).

A six-foot boulder sculpture of a jaguar mask at Cerro de las Mesas (Monument 2) on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz is strikingly similar, especially in the rendering of the eyes, ear plumes, exposed gum and mouth scrolls. Three large stone incense burners from Kaminaljuyu, carved in the form of Olmecoid jaguar heads, are also similar in the treatment of these features. Two other Middle to Late Pre-Classic sculptures of large size from southern Guatemala (Palo Gordo and Kaminal- juyu), which represent seated anthropomorphic jaguar monsters, have facial features showing a stylistic rela- tionship to the Monte Alto mask. The third type of boulder sculpture to be consid- ered is the archaic-looking rotund, or even pot-bellied, human figure. At present we know of thirty-five non- portable examples in southern Guatemala; these have a certain amount of stylistic variation which may prove to be an indication of date. The three boulder effigies at Monte Alto (see Figures 10-12) are un- usual in having been formed with a minimum of al- teration to the original spheroid boulders: the human figure seems to have been "applied" in high relief to the rock surface, with the arms and legs wrapped around balloon-like bodies. The heads are related to Monuments 1 and 2 in being bald and in having a groove around the broad nose and full-lipped mouth, as well as similar ears with perforated disc orna- ments. The eyes appear to be closed. The sexless bodies are nude, except for Monument 6, which has a 137</page><page sequence="7">7. Olmecoid jaguar monster mask (somewhat eroded), Monument 3 at Monte Alto.

BOULDER SCULPTURE continued wide plain collar, upper arm bands and an interesting medallion on the breast which may be a serpent- jaw motif (an early rain symbol?). We do not know of any other boulder effigies quite as massive as those at Monte Alto, although two in Berlin, which are from Bilbao (Figure 14), perhaps come the closest. These also have collars. Another example, from finca La Concepcion on the Pacific Coast (now in Paris), is nearly identical to one of the Berlin figures. The Ber- lin sculptures have sagittal crests, a feature occasion- ally found on Olmec figures. With outsized heads and curved spines, these examples resemble the human fetus; one (Figure 14, left) has the navel promi- nently marked. The recently discovered sculpture at Bilbao (see Figure 13) represents a truly pot-bellied variation of human effigy boulder sculptures. It has crossed legs, a flat back and a protruding belly clasped by the hands. Its facial type resembles that of the Monte Alto boulder sculptures; the wide jaw and the tapering, elongated head with its upward tilt recall typical Ol- mec representations in both figurines and life-sized seated figures. The straight-back feature seems to be common to the majority of Pre-Classic human effigy boulder sculptures in Guatemala. These are evenly distributed from San Isidro Piedra Parada to Pasaco on the Pacific Coast, and from Utatlan in the western highlands of Guatemala to Kaminaljuyu in the central highlands (twelve examples from this latter site alone) and as far as Copan, Honduras. Most of the examples are undated, though one fragment at Kaminaljuyu came from a mound that is at least as old as Late Pre- Classic. There is a suggestion that the style distribu- tion extends to the Gulf Coast and Yucatan, where a few miniature pot-belly sculptures are reported.

An early style, related to the boulder sculptures at Monte Alto and also widespread in southern Guatemala. BOULDER SCULPTURE continued (Figure 15) strikingly parallels the facial style of the three Bilbao sculptures, especially in the puffed, closed eyes and full lips. A small group of artifacts found at Monte Alto may be helpful in dating the boulder sculpture. We collected 180 potsherds from the surfaces of mounds and from the earth around the sculptures ; as we did not excavate below any of the monuments, these sherds presumably are later in date than the sculptures. The entire sample can be related to known Pre-Classic pottery styles except for a single sherd of Post-Classic micaceous ware and one modern glazed sherd. There- fore Monte Alto was probably unoccupied throughout the entire Classic period; it may even be an exclu- sively Pre-Classic site. The bulk of the identifiable sherds are Late Pre-Classic, and the most recent type found can be no later than the Late Pre-Classic "Arenal" phase of Kaminaljuyu. Our sample included some presumably Middle Pre-Classic pottery styles such as white-rim blackware, thick-rimmed seed jars and glossy white-paste wares. A smaller surface col- lection made a few years ago by S. W. Miles appar- ently even included some sherds in Early Pre-Classic styles but, like our sample, showed a complete absence of Classic pottery. A remarkably preserved round-bot- tomed bowl with slightly incurving rim (Figure 16) was salvaged during a landscaping operation near the site, thanks to Señora Girón. Its style probably best fits a transitional Middle to Late Pre-Classic period. Two miniature clay heads found at Monte Alto are 140</page><page sequence="10">14.

Photos courtesy of Peabody Museum, Harvard University. BOULDER SCULPTURE continued without doubt Pre-Classic. The whistle fragment from a ceramic vessel (Figure 17, left) is of a style found in late Las Charcas deposits at Kaminaljuyu (late Middle Pre-Classic) . The treatment of the eyes of the figurine head (Figure 17, right) is found on Middle Pre-Classic figurines in many parts of Middle Amer- ica. A small stone artifact from Monte Alto, a cir- cularly grooved "mushroom cap," is considered by S. F. de Borhegyi, an authority on mushroom-shaped artifacts, to be at least Middle Pre-Classic if not older. This evidence leads us to postulate that occupation of Monte Alto was at its peak between the sixth and fourth centuries before Christ (transitional Middle to Late Pre-Classic) , though it is distinctly possible that some of the boulder sculptures could have been carved as early as 1000 b.c. In attempting to fit the Monte Alto sculptures into a general cultural framework, we must see if any non-portable sculpture in pure Olmec style is to be found in the Pacific Coast area. As we have men- tioned, two sites with Olmec petroglyphs on boulders are known in this general area. More significant for assessing the relationship between the Monte Alto boulder sculptures and Olmec sculpture are four large seated figures at Sin Cabezas, near Tiquisate and only thirty miles west of Monte Alto. Two of these are here illustrated (Figures 18, 19). (The Sin Cabezas sculptures were first published by Edwin M. Shook in Unifruitco , August 1950, 62-63.) Despite the missing heads, in posture and sculptural feeling these cross- 1 egged human figures are unmistakably like the Olmec type of non-portable figure which sits cross-legged and bent slightly forward. This style is not uncommon on the Gulf Coast, where at least a dozen comparable sculptures may be cited (see Reading List) . The niche figures on the well known Olmec monolithic altars and the Olmec "wrestler" sculpture are also stylisti- cally related. Sculpture 1 at Sin Cabezas (see Figure 18) has the elbows resting on the thighs, with the hands on the chest; Sculpture 2 (see Figure 19) may be holding a baby. The arms of the Gulf Coast Olmec figures are either broken off or in different positions ; sometimes they hold a baby. Unlike the Gulf Coast sculptures, all the Sin Cabezas figures have rounded pedestal bases. One of them (not illustrated) has a decidedly protruding belly, which is clasped by the hands, suggesting a direct relationship to the group of pot-bellied sculptures in southern Guatemala dis- cussed above (see Figure 13 and page 138). The Sin 143</page><page sequence="13">BOULDER SCULPTURE continued Cabezas sculptures were apparently being re-used in front of a Late Classic mound. Are the three classes of boulder sculpture at Monte Alto - colossal head, jaguar monster and spheroid hu- man effigy - later, earlier or contemporary but mar- ginal to Olmec art ? We may also ask : were the three types of sculpture even carved at the same time ? As a point of departure in solving these problems, we have established that at least one of the monuments (num- ber 3, the jaguar monster) is stylistically Olmecoid and therefore post-Olmec. The grouping of the sculp- tures at the site implies their general contemporaneity. We are tentatively taking the position, therefore, that all six Monte Alto sculptures are slightly post-Olmec in time (transition Middle to Late Pre-Classic) and, like the Olmecoid jaguar monster, stylistically derived from Olmec. From the standpoint of typology, how- ever, one might not expect the three types of sculpture to be contemporary. The jaguar monster, to be sure, seems relatively late, while the colossal heads and ro- tund boulder sculptures, which are stylistically close to one another, seem extremely archaic. It has been pro- posed, in fact, that much of the boulder sculpture in this area is pre-Olmec, if not the earliest stone sculp- ture in Middle America (see Reading List) . This of course would imply that the Pacific Coast had a sig- nificant creative role in the development of Olmec civilization. The conceptual and stylistic continuity between the Monte Alto colossal heads and the Olmec colossal heads on the Gulf Coast is clear (see Figures 1, 3-6) . Nevertheless, it is impossible to ascertain on typological grounds alone whether any of the boulder sculptures are proto-Olmec or derived Olmec; so this important problem of evolutionary development awaits further evidence in the form of excavation and radio- carbon dates. Finally, the possibility that the Monte Alto sculptures are a contemporary but provincial ex- pression of Olmec art cannot be overlooked. On the other hand, the suggested presence of pure Olmec sculpture at other sites on the Pacific Coast argues against this. Further investigation might even reveal Olmec-style sculpture at Monte Alto. A basic problem is whether true Olmec settlements ever existed on the Pacific Coast of Mexico and Gua- temala, partly because the region is still one of the least known archaeologically. It is frequently argued, with some justification, that portable Olmec stone carvings such as the fragment from El Baul, which may have been traded through "middlemen" and even preserved as heirlooms, do not necessarily represent the direct diffusion of Olmec people and culture. But the existence of non-portable Olmec sculpture, as at Sin Cabezas, should be sufficient evidence for the ac- tual presence of Olmec people. On the basis of what evidence we have, we may make two assumptions: first, it is probable that at an early period there was intensive cultural flow between the Gulf Coast of Mexico and the southern Pacific Coast of Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. This region, composed of continuous lowland tropical rainforest and savanna, is a single unit geographically and environmentally. Second, some sort of developmental relationship ex- isted between boulder sculptures such as those found at Monte Alto and monumental Olmec sculpture. What we do not know - and what can only be solved by more excavation - is the place of origin, the se- quence of development and the direction of diffusion of these art styles. In this connection, any serious search for evidence of Asiatic stimuli for Olmec civili- zation might profit by an investigation of sites with "archaic" stone monuments on the Pacific Coast of Middle America. Monte Alto, in Guatemala, is a key site for the resolution of these problems ; a Milwaukee Public Museum expedition plans to return soon to conduct a thorough excavation of its mounds and monuments.
