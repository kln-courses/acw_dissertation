<plain_text><page sequence="1">BARON DAVID GUNZBURG AND HIS ACADEMY* Zalman Shazar, Israel This tribute to our teacher is dedicated to my old friend and fellow-student at the Academy, Professor Solomon Zeitlin, upon the occasion of his jubilee. At the beginning of this century Wissenschaft des Judentums, the scientific study of Jewish subjects, was still an exotic Western growth as far as Russian Jewry was concerned. Its founders and propagators and the academic institutions they established to train younger generations of scholars were all to be found outside the borders of the largest Jewish Diaspora community. In Russian Jewry's developing cultural centers, whether their language was Russian, Hebrew or Yiddish, the modern Galician scholars who wrote Hebrew and, in particular, the German scholars, who wrote in German, seemed far and foreign. Those Russian Jews who thirsted for Jewish scholarship made their way to the West or absorbed the products of Western academicians at second-hand. The Jewish monthlies in Russian fed their readers with translations from the work of German Jewish scholars, and many of the greatest and most original among the Hebrew writers in Russia (Professor A. E. Harkavy, S. P. Rabinowitz, for example) concerned themselves with translating and elucidating the basic books of German Wissenschaft des Judentums. Very few and very distinguished were those Russian Jews who were spiritually rooted in Eastern Europe but open to the West, aspiring to graft Western scientific method upon the profound traditional learning of Eastern Jewry. This synthesis, they felt, would be the salvation fo Wissenschaft des Judentums itself, as well as a blessing to the development of Russian Jewry. * Si ringrazia la redazione della «Jewish Quarterly Review», che ha cortesemente autorizzato la ripubblicazione di quest'articolo, apparso ne The Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Volume of the Jewish Quarterly Review, a cura di Abraham A. Neuman e Solomon Zeitlin, Philadelphia 1967, pp. 1-17.</page><page sequence="2">96 la rassegna mensile di Israel One of the most remarkable in this little group was Baron David Gunzburg, youngest scion of the house of Jewish aristocrats who for three generations, from the time of the Napoleonic War to the beginnings of parliamentary democracy in the Czarist Empire, had been Russia's leading and most representative Jewish family in the eyes of the central and local Governmental authorities and of the Jews themselves. For years the scholarly Baron dreamed of establishing an institute for Jewish studies in the capital city of Russia, but for all his special connections with prominent figures in the Government he could not get a permit to establish the institute until he began to describe it by the non- committal name of an «advanced school of Oriental Studies» and agreed that it would have no official academic standing and that study in it would not confer the right of residence in St. Petersburg. There was no financial assistance from any public fund or institution, not even from the «Disseminators of Enlightenment» ( Mefitzei Haskalah beYisrael), which association he himself headed, nor from the Jewish Colonization Association of which he was one of the directors. Actually, the institute, which was popularly known as the «Academy of Jewish Studies», came into being with no help from any political or communal body and depended entirely on the Baron's good name and endless devotion. Once the external obstacles were overcome, the Baron was to learn how many internal difficulties confronted him, particularly in assembling the teaching staff and assigning the subjects of study among them. To his great sorrow he had to reconcile himself to doing without Russia's two greatest scholars in the Jewish field at that time. One was the aged Professor Daniel Chwolson, the famous Orientalist, from whose teaching, the Baron felt, the Academy's students would have benefitted immeasurably. Chwolson had courageously defended Jews and Judaism against the blood libels recurrently hurled at them; he had warmly encouraged the Baron to establish the Academy «lest Torah be forgotten in Israel». But the Baron, who admired his scholarship immensely, could not possibly ask him - nor, in point of fact, did he wish to ask him - to join the teaching staff. For Chwolson had been converted to Christianity decades back and had trained two generations of Russian Orthodox priests. Though the attitude of even famous rabbis towards him was rather lenient, the Baron could never forgive any convert. For all that, he was later to arrange to have students go to Chwolson's home for lectures on Hebrew grammar. It was the last winter of Chwolson's life - he was more than ninety years old and had to be carried into the room in a rocking chair. Wrapped in woolen blankets, he never moved out of the</page><page sequence="3">CACCIA AL TESORO DEI GUNZBURG 97 chair, and the voice that spoke to us with a strong Jewish accent in its Russian, was the voice of a dying man. The case of the second great scholar was altogether different. This was the head of the Oriental Department of the Royal Library, old Abraham Eliahu Harkavy, of whom the Baron spoke with all the admiration a student feels for his master. Harkavy was of great assistance to the Baron in planning the Academy, but absolutely refused to teach in it. He felt bound by the vow he had made to Rabbi Isaac Elhanan, one of the most venerated rabbis of Russia: he had solemnly promised that he would never teach in a modern rabbinical seminary, if an institution of that Western European type were established in Russia. The rabbis knew that without Harkavy 's participation no such seminary would be possible, and they insisted on his taking the vow, since otherwise he might be influenced by the Mefitzei Haskalah , who were in fact responsible for his appointment at the Library and his retention in the post. Harkavy was so faithful to his pledge and so fearful of any possible involvement that he could not be convinced even by the Baron, his friend and collaborator in the Jewish Encyclopedia: in vain did the Baron point out that the Academy was by no manner of means intended to train rabbis and was concerned only with the advancement of pure scholarship, untouched by professional considerations. In vain, too, did the students tell Harkavy of their utter disinclination to become Government-appointed rabbis. Other famous scholars like Israelson, Baratz, and Wiener, for one reason or another could not join the Academy's staff, and the Baron was compelled to adopt a new policy. He added to his few illustrious teachers young and promising scholars who, he believed, would grow in the course of their teaching. They would develop and their students with them. When I came to the Academy I found six or seven students who had preceded me, all of them from provincial towns, all of them fervently eager to study, almost all without means, and most of them without permits to reside in St. Petersburg, which was outside the pale of Jewish settlement. Among them were former students of the traditional Bet Ha- Midrash and some who were already leaders of Zionist and Revolutionary movements. Solomon Zeitlin was one of the little group I found. Later on, he and I were assigned to the same room and shared it for two years. The Academy had as yet no building of its own, and all the lectures were given in Baron Gunzburg's private library. In fact, he was concerned with every aspect of the students' lives. They were accepted after passing</page><page sequence="4">98 LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL a unique type of examination - a long and detailed conversation with the Baron about a number of Jewish and general topics, both scholarly and of public and communal interest. If they were admitted to the Academy but had no residence permit, they were turned over to the care of the Baron's steward: he found them their first lodgings and assigned them to occupations whose practitioners were entitled to live in the city. That is to say, by means of regular payments to various artisans and to the police inspectors in their districts, students were registered as painters or ink- makers, waiters or doorkeepers in wealthy Jewish homes. Lest a police inspector who had not yet been bribed come to look for them, they had to appear from time to time at fixed hours in their "places of employment". The official opening of the Academy took place on January 1, 1909, in the presence of a large audience including the leading Jewish writers, scholars and cultured laymen of the capital. The building purchased for the Academy was close to the Baron's private residence: on the top floor a Kasher restaurant was opened, serving all the Jewish students in the city and managed chiefly by students of the Academy. The house became a magnet drawing the best Jewish academic youth, whatever their movements and factions. During 1909 a group from the University of St. Petersburg entered the Academy, and a year later a number of graduates of the Yeshiva established in Odessa by Rav Tzair (Chernowitz), Bialik and Klausner. For the opening a full program of studies was prepared and printed. The list of the faculty included some very famous names, most attractive to the students, who already knew their books. There were also names of young scholars whose chief recommendation was the confidence the Baron had in them. The teacher of the history of Halacha was Dr. J. L. Katznelson, editor of the Jewish Encyclopedia. Under the pseudonym of Buki Ben Yagli, he wrote Hebrew stories which we knew and loved. His lectures on the Talmud quickly became very popular, having much to give even to those of us, like Zeitlin, who were steeped in Gemara: he would analyse disputed issues by referring to the social and religious conditions among the Jews of Babylon or Palestine and among the neighboring peoples. Very often he would stray into the sidepaths that were so dear to him as a physician and discuss medicine in the Talmud, the laws of purity in the Bible and in later tradition, and the influence of Zoroastrianism on Talmudic legislation, all of these subjects of life-long study on his part. History was taught us by the most famous historian in Russian Jewry, Shimon Dubnow. Over the three years of our course his lectures covered</page><page sequence="5">CACCIA AL TESORO DEI GUNZBURG 99 the whole of Jewish history from its Biblical beginnings to our day. Master-architect in historiography, he built his lectures with utmost care, assigning to each period its proportionate place in the entire structure. He was then completing his great ten-volume history, perfecting its structure and checking the accuracy of all the details. The chapters, as prepared, served as the basis of his lectures to us, and he was at the same time publishing his introductory summaries in the historic quarterly he edited. During the first year he devoted a good deal of attention to the development of historic writing, the calssification of periods, and the sociological method which he applied in his studies. Though the particular field to which he had made distinguished and novel contributions, was modern Jewish history in Eastern Europe, he gave his preliminary lectures on the Biblical period so effectively that what he managed to say about modern Biblical criticism opened new worlds to us. At the same time the lessons in which we worked on modern source materials gave us our first training in independent research. Dubnow's lectures were held on Saturday and Thursday evenings in a truly festive atmosphere. The large hall of the Academy was full of young men and women, many of them students from the University and the Polytechnion or the women's university in St. Petersburg. Dubnow lectured sitting, but his voice was strong and clear and his Russian rich and picturesque. Though he dealt with innumerable details in each of his two hour lectures, one always felt his deep sense of reverence for the destiny of our unique people and for the organic unity woven out of all those varied and distinct facts. I recall a significant instance of the special attitude of reverence young people felt for Dubnow's lectures. One of those who came to listen to him on Thursday evenings was Joseph Trumpeldor, the tall, vigorous, one-armed hero of Port Arthur. He was a famous figure in Russian Jewry, and we Labor Zionists knew that he dreamed of establishing a completely independent and vocationally self-sustaining commune or Kvutza in Palestine, an idea the merits of which we frequently debated. One Thursday, a little while before Dubnow's lecture was scheduled to begin, Trumpeldor suddenly appeared in my room. He was dressed in his bemedalled officer's uniform, which he had to wear that day since it was an official holiday. «I've come to change my clothes, » he said. «This foreign costume would desecrate the hall in which the great historian of our people lectures on our past». The younger scholars on the faculty were clearly beginning to believe that it would no longer be possible for one man to write the entire history</page><page sequence="6">1 00 LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL of the Jewish people: the time of Jost, Graetz and Dubnow, they felt, was over and so much knowledge was required for each period and each country that future histories would have to be the collective work of a group of scholars, each discussing the period of which he had specialized knowledge. Hence scholars had best choose whatever facet of Jewish history was most interesting to them and devote themselves to it. Dubnow's view was diametrically opposed. What he tried to impress upon his students as supremely important was consciousness of interrelationship and continuous development in Jewish history, all Jewish history constituting, in his view, a single human creation, each period being rooted in the one preceding it, deriving from it, and at the same generating the subsequent one. Leaving out a period was like cutting an act out of a play that had been constructed as an artistic unit. As for the specialists in particular periods, all they did, really, was to prepare the bricks for a future building. The true architect in historiography, Dubnow emphasized, was he who knew how to put the bricks together into a many-storeyed, well-constructed building, and only those who planned to master the intricacies of the entire building would he accept as his disciples. While Dubnow's public lectures were devoted to the general processes of Jewish history, his seminars were concerned with the study of minute details. A small group of students would sit in a circle around him, one or another of us serving as lecturer while our teacher listened attentively and led us in discussion. We soon became very fond of these seminar meetings. I still remember how hard I worked on my first lecture. I dealt with the memoirs of Gluckel von Hameln as a source for the history of Jewish communities in seventeenth century Europe. The Yiddish manuscript had just been published by Professor Kaufmann and for months I collected material from rabbinical Responsa and homiletics and community records - background for the elucidation of the memoirs of that extraordinary woman. Years later when I participated in the seminars of Friedrich Meinecke in Freiburg and Eduard Meier in Berlin. I realized how much of historic method I had learned from our group meetings with Dubnow. In addition to his public lectures and small closed seminars, Dubnow taught us in still a third way - he had one or another or us accompany him on the stroll he took through the city every day between four and six in the afternoon. This was his recreation after working long hours at his many projects: the great History he was preparing for publication, the History of Hassidism he was writing, the historical quarterly he edited,</page><page sequence="7">CACCIA AL TESORO DEI GUNZBURG 1 0 1 the lectures he prepared for the Academy, and the many communal activities in which he took a leading role. As teacher and student walked together, there were always unforgettable talks through which we learnt to know and appreciate our master even more. Then there was the crucial incident before our final examinations, when we came to his study and asked him to tell us what period of Jewish history he could emphasize in his questions, so that we might know on what to concentrate in our last weeks of study. He looked at us very sadly and said: «An intelligent Jew must feel completely at home in every period of Jewish history». I was truly frightened of the burden he seemed to be imposing on us, and it was only when I was more mature that I began to understand what he meant when he spoke of the essential unity of Jewish history - unity which he lived in himself and wanted us, his pupils, to feel as he did. If Dubnow and Dr. Katznelson were our most famous teachers, we had younger but very gifted instructors in a number of disciplines. There were Dr. Abraham Zarzovsky in Philology, Dr. A. P. Kaminetsky in Apocrypha, Dr. Jonah J. Ginsburg in Arabic, Dr. S. M. Goldstein in Russian Jewish history. There was I. D. Markon, pupil of Chwolson and Harkavy and then of Steinschneider, who worked in the Royal Library, followed in the footsteps of Harkavy, and taught us Medieval Hebrew Literature, paying special attention to the Karaites. In the world of Talmud there were Rabbi Aryeh Karlin and the lawyer, H. B. Slossberg. The former was modest and retiring, a brilliant product of the Lithuanian Yeshivot, who had studied dentistry in order not to be dependent upon a rabbinical post and at the same time to receive permission to reside in St. Petersburg. He contributed articles on legal and historic questions in the Talmud to the Jewish Encyclopedia. Slossberg, on the other hand, though he had studied in a yeshiva in his youth, had gone into a very different sphere, becoming a famous jurist, politically active, a defender of Jewish rights in Russia along with the distinguished M. M. Vinaver. Rabbi Karlin would sit at the head of the table, expounding a Talmudic problem with a Gemara open before him and a volume of Maimonides' Yad ha-Hazakah at its side, while Slossberg followed his exposition by referring to German and Russian translations of the Talmud. He would then add a legal commentary on the case from the point of view of Roman Law and of the modern juridical concepts accepted in the West and Russia. In his memoirs written during his life as a political emigre in Paris, he spoke with great warmth about Baron Gunzburg and about the lectures he himself had given at the Academy.</page><page sequence="8">1 02 LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL First and foremost among the teachers was Baron David Gunzberg himself. The Jewish Encyclopedia in Russian, which he edited, contained a small biographical item about him where with characteristic modesty he refused to have even his chief scholary publications listed or his picture printed: the article did, however, state that he lectured at the Academy «on Talmudic and Rabbinic Literature, Arabic Literature, Semitic Philology and Religious Philosophy». Actually he taught and conducted seminars in all these disciplines, each of them reinforcing and sustaining the others. He never did become reconciled to the division of Jewish scholarship into clearly defined subjects: he agreed that the highly specialized knowledge required for each subject made special instructors necessary, but the material itself seemed to him to tolerate no divisions. The true scholar, he felt, made his way through all the separate rooms of Torah as through interrelated parts of a single mansion, and conducted his students through their splendors. Had time permitted and academic opinion allowed it, he would gladly have taught all the, branches. He did so during the Academy's first year when he was our only teacher and all our studying was done in the rooms of his library. Even after che curriculum was subdivided, all the courses he taught were connected with each other and formed a single intellectual unit, the axis on which all of them revolved being Jewish thought regarding God, the world, and the Jewish people itself. When for a while he read Gemara with us, he gave particular emphasis to the mystic concept of Merkava, the Chariot, and the loftiness of God. When he concerned himself with Literary History, he devoted a whole winter term to Philo of Alexandria and the intellectual links between him and Plato. For an entire year he taught us Hasdai Crescas' Or Adonai, the Ralbag's Milhamot Hashem, and Tagmulai HaNephesh of R. Hillel of Verona. He lectured at length on each of them, and in our discussion groups with him we students analyzed them chapter by chapter. Invariably he would add explanations in his rich Russian slightly tinged with a French accent. As he presented them to us, the ideas in the texts were seen against the background of the entire development of religious-philosophical thought and, specifically, the work of previous Jewish thinkers. It was his custom to come to all his lessons, and particularly to the seminars, with a satchel full of books. He never read from a paper, but was always remarkably well prepared, as we could gather from the many books, large and small, he had brought with him, opened at the relevant places or stuck full of little bits of paper that indicated the chapters and pages he intended to refer to. He would set up the whole pile of books</page><page sequence="9">CACCI A AL TESORO DEI GUNZBURG 1 03 and was visibly delighted when any of us examined them, after his lectures and asked for additional explanations. A uniquely interesting world opened before us when he lectured on Hebrew Philology. Equipped with extraordinary knowledge, he seemed to swim through seas of lexicography. He was said to be the master of thirty-six languages and of all the intricacies of their respective grammars. When he entered the classroom, he was always followed by one of his servants carrying dictionaries of various kinds which we would then see the Baron consulting like a true polyglot virtuoso. He found pleasure in pointing out both what was common to various languages and what was peculiar to one or another and entirejy without parallel elsewhere. He classified words by their families and by the development they had gone through during the ages and as a result of the relationships between peoples, and when he lectured on the history of Hebrew Grammar and Semitic Grammar generally and on the disputes between ancient grammarians, his studies touched upon all the languages of man and the most subtle of linguistic points. For those few among us who were enthusiastic about the study of Grammar, Baron Gunzberg's course in that subject was no less than delightful. We began with the Zahot of Ibn Ezra and went on to Sefer HaRiqma of R. Yona Ibn-Genah for whom the Baron felt particular affection. He was always more than ready to show an interested student more and more, and books and passages out of his vast treasury. All these lessons and lectures were in essence merely a sort of entry hall to the great main chamber which was Maimonides' Guide to the Perplexed. He never ceased to regret that because we made so little progress in our study of Arabic, he could not teach us the Guide in the original. For him Maimonides was the central and ideal figure in Jewish intellectual history. His huge library, housed in many rooms and halls, opened on to a darkish, small, intimate sort of room which was his private study - and a private doorway, one might say, to the sanctuary of Jewish and world thought. At the heart of this study, above his desk always laden with the books, pamphlets, manuscripts and proof sheets with which he was preoccupied, hung the only picture in the room, facing the door. It was a medium-sized portrait of Maimonides in a gilt frame. Actually that picture was the symbolic key to all the scholarly treasures that filled the Library. When during recesses or after class we argued heatedly with each other about general and Jewish problems, the Baron listened intently, like a patient father who understood our youthful zeal. It was not unusual for</page><page sequence="10">1 04 LA RASSEGN A MENSILE DI ISRAEL him to invite one or another of us to come to see him and discuss ideas of ours which seemed mistaken to him. I was always deeply moved by the delicacy with which he spoke to us on those occasions and the care he took not to attack concepts cherished by our generation, which he was, in fact, most eager to dislodge from our minds. I remember very well the conversation in which he tried to open my eyes to the inadequacy - as he saw it - of the terms «Nationalism and Assimilation» which I used so frequently in discussions with my fellow students. When he felt that I remained unconvinced, he resorted to an argument that seemed to him beyond dispute - the case of Maimonides. Could I possibly fit Maimonides into either of my two favorite categories? Was he a nationalist in his thinking? How could he have been, when he lived by the best in the world thought of his age, absorbed the wisdom of Greece, possessed all the intellectual treasures of the Arabs and wrote his books in Arabic, was friendly with non-Jewish rulers and groups, fought against the anthropomorphism which generation after generation of our people had accepted as holy, and suffered persecution at the hands of the unyielding «Keepers of the Walls» among us? Yet, on the other hand, could you call him an assimilationist? How could you, when he, more than any other Jew, elevated and sanctified Jewish thought according to all the concepts of science and philosophy? Was it not he who had fixed and consolidated the Halacha for his generation and those to follow; who had formulated the precepts of the Creed that became basic for all Judaism? If my definitions could not be applied to the great and primary figure, how could smaller men and events be classified according to them? Was it not, therefore, clear that the terms «nationalist» and «assimilationist», cherished by me and my contemporaries failed to meet all the requirements of our complex situation and should be replaced or supplemented by other definitions? I can still see him as he stood opposite me during that long talk, he, the teacher, leaning against the door post between his study and his library, and I, the student, trying to defend myself against his attack. I remember how agitated he was in spirit, how restrained in judgment and noble in argument - while above his head hung the picture of Maimonides... One of the disciplines which we students felt to be lacking and necessary was historical study of the social and economic life of Jews in the Diaspora. It was not easy to find a specialist in this, and when Dubnow, whom we had impressed with our desire for such study, came at</page><page sequence="11">CACCIA AL TESORO DEI GUNZBURG 1 05 last to tell us that there was a fine young scholar available - Dr. M. L. Wischnitzer of Vienna - he added with restrained sadness that he feared the Baron would not agreed to open the doors of the Academy to a course stressing the «new fangled» social and economic approach. We students decided to try to appeal to Baron Gunzburg directly. We knew the warmth of his feellings for his Academy and its student body, and trusted that somehow we would succeed in gaining his consent. He agreed to receive a delegation. There were three of us, and to this day I remember with absolute clarity the talk between us and the fatherly Baron. I had been charged with opening our case; there in the Baron's study, facing the picture of Maimonides, I spoke of the need for this new discipline and of the young scholar who was available. Excitedly, the Baron rose from his chair, leaned against the doorpost opening on to his great library, crossed one leg over the other, and said (as always in Russian, the language of the Academy's lectures): Dear ones, I am deeply grieved by this request of yours. I am certain that you have no intention in the world of causing me unhappiness, and it is very difficult for me to say «No» to you. But how can I hide my concern from you? You have come here to study the nature and destiny of the Jewish people - and I hear you now asking to be taught what occupations Jews were compelled to engage in to keep alive. It is as if a scholar had been asked to lecture to you on Kant and then, instead of teaching you the Critique of Pure Reason , spent his time describing the restaurant Kant frequented and the kind of cutlets his wife gave him. And it is not Kant you are studying, but that exalted people God chose for His own! Do you really think it so important to know exactly when the Gentiles permitted us to engage in trade and when those malicious nations forced us to be moneylenders? What good will the information do you? And wouldn't it be a pity to spend your precious time on this when there are still so many rooms in the mansion of Jewish scholarship that are closed to you and so many illuminating books waiting for you? As he spoke, he pointed to the tens of rooms filled with bookshelves from floor to ceiling, endless, infinite treasure of books... We shrank before the majesty of his suppressed rage. And he, walking excitedly across the room between the desk and the books, stood still suddenly and went on even more bitingly: • If you do research on horses - there is such a science, too - it is obviously very important to investigate what fodder should be put in the horses' crib, oats or barley. But when the subject of your study is the Chosen People, do</page><page sequence="12">1 06 LA RASSEGN A MENSILE DI ISRAEL you think that their fodder and their crib should concern you? And then, to point up further the vast distance between what seemed to him the correct approach to Jewish history and the one we had been misled into advocating, he said: Do you know, dear ones, how I would lecture to you about the history of our people, if I were given the subject to teach? Suppose, for example, that we were dealing with the end of the Spanish Period. I would give a lecture of one hour on the enviable position occupied by the Jewish community in that country, the great contributions they made to its culture and political life, one of them even becoming a Minister of the State, Don Isaac Abarbanel by name, born in year so and so, died in year so and so, and author of such and such books. This would be my material for one hour. The rest of the year would be spent on the contents of Don Isaac's books! That is true Jewish history, and that and only that is worthy of real study. To our acute regret, we saw that we had grieved the Baron greatly. We did not dare to appeal to him any further and we walked out a little ashamed and with no promise at all from him. But a week later, going into the lecture hall, we found a notice on the wall signed by the administration of the Academy. It announced the date on which Dr. M. L. Wischnitzer would begin to lecture on «The Economic History of the Jews»: students wishing to take the course, were requested to register. None of the Academy's teachers are with us any longer, and of the students, too, only a handful survive. There were some among our teachers who lived to a ripe old age and others who died before their time. In the year when his seventieth birthday was to be celebrated, Buki Ben-Yagli died; it was at the beginning of the First World War and he was spared the dreadful things to come. Shimon Dubnow died a martyr's death with all the slaughtered Jews of Riga when the Nazi Satan laid the ghetto waste. Markon and Slossberg died in foreign lands, the former in Hamburg, the latter in Paris, both of them uprooted from the place of their work and influence, and doomed to be twice exiled. Only Dr. Wischnitzer and Rabbi Karlin were laid to eternal rest in the soil of Eretz Israel. Rabbi Karlin had been able to reestablish his household in Israel, and to publish a number of his legal studies there; it was even given to him to participate in drafting the laws of the Jewish State. As for Dr. Wischnitzer who had joined the faculty of Yeshiva University in New York, he spent the last months of his life in Israel, working out plans for comprehensive study of the history of Russian Jewry and renewing his ties with relatives, friends and students who lived in Israel, until he parted from them forever.</page><page sequence="13">CACCIA AL TESORO DEI GUNZBURG 1 07 Only one of our teachers died while the Academy was still open and functioning: that was its founder and shaper, Baron Gunzburg himself. I was not in Petersburg during the vacation period of late summer 1910, when he was stricken by disease and foiced out of active life. Returning after the High Holidays, I found that he was mortally ill and could be visited for no longer than a few moments. Only a short time was to pass before we, his pupils, stood as mourners around his bed in his study. Spontaneously - no decision had been taken nor suggestion made - we began to recite the Psalms. We went on for long hours. Life scattered the Academy's students far and wide, in the lands of the Diaspora and in Israel. Some became teachers and themselves raised up students; others had the yoke of public responsibility thrust upon them; no small number were cruelly rooted out of life. During and after the Russian Revolution, attempts were made to reopen the Academy, but these had no permanent success. Yet though it was destroyed in the first days of the storm, and the light of all its teachers was totally extinguished, and the scholarly work of some has still not been gathered together out of journals and collections - the Academy and its teachers live in the grateful and appreciative recollection of the surviving students, and the noble figure of the first teacher will never vanish from the memory of the last of his students.</page><page sequence="14">1 08 LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL 'Condensate' dell'articolo di Zalman Shazar apparso sulla « Jewish Quarterly Review» di Filadelfia per il 75mo anniversa- rio del la ri vista (1967) All'inizio del Novecento lo studio delle Judaica fuori daH'ambito delle Yeshivot era tutto di importazione nella Russia degli Zar: fra le poche famiglie che lo colti- vassero (e questo sin dai tempi di Napoleone) la piu eminente era quella dei Gunzburg: una casata di immenso prestigio presso la comunita ebraica, che godeva speciale trattamento e considerazione anche presso le autorita governative e quelle locali. {In proposito , vedere qui V introduzione di Guido Lopez). Ma neppure al grande Barone David Gunzburg fu concesso sotto gli Zar di fon- dare una propria Accademia di Studi Ebraici nella capitale sino a che non si rasse- gno ad intitolarla genericamente «Scuola di Alti Studi Orientali». Fu anche stabilito che l'Alta Scuola non avrebbe elargito titoli accademici e non avrebbe dato luogo a permessi di soggiorno in citta ai suoi frequentatori. Men che meno avrebbe potuto fruire di sussidi esterni: tutto doveva reggersi - e si resse - grazie agli sforzi e al- le sostanze del fondatore. Deciso a convocare come docenti le massime autorita della cultura ebraica, il Barone dovette tuttavia rinunciare a due grandi firme. Ecco perche: il prof. Daniel Chvolson, da tempo convertito al Cristianesimo, aveva riversato i tesori del suo sa- pere su due generazioni di preti Ortodossi. Inconcepibile affidargli un incarico entro I' Accademia; ma tale era la sapienza di quel gran vecchio (95 anni compiuti) e me- ritorie le sue battaglie in difesa degli ebrei e dell'ebraismo, che agli allievi del Baro- ne fu consentito di avvicinarlo privatamente. Tutto avvolto in coperte di lana, parla- va dal suo scranno con una voce fioca da moribondo (russo con forte accento ebrai- co). Un altro grande maestro, Eliahu Harkavi, rifiuto la proposta del Barone per fe- delta a un voto pronunciato davanti a uno dei piu venerati rabbini di Russia: che mai avrebbe insegnato in una scuola rabbinica di impostazione occidentale; e il Barone non riusci a convincerlo che in effetti 1' Accademia non dava titoli di nessun genere. Quando Zalman Shazar (Shazar: acrostico israeliano del nome russo Schneur Zalman Rubashov) raggiunse l'Accademia Gunzburg, la frequentavano sei o sette studenti di provincia, per lo piu senza permesso di soggiorno; il Barone vi suppliva con l'aiuto di bustarelle, ovvero li faceva passare per imbianchini, fabbricanti di in- chiostri, portieri, camerieri (in case ebraiche); di tanto in tanto, dovevano farsi tro- vare sul posto di lavoro fasullo. Per Tapertura ufficiale dell'Accademia (i corsi erano iniziati gia da prima) il Barone mise a disposizione un apposito palazzo accanto alia propria dimora; e al- Fultimo piano delFedificio fece aprire un ristorante strettamente kasher, servito da allievi dell' Accademia, a disposizione di tutti gli studenti ebrei in citta. Secondo Tarticolo di Shazar questo sarebbe avvenuto il primo di gennaio del 1909; secondo le ricerche di Volodia Halperin (vedi articolo introduttivo) l'anno precedente. Ed ecco alcuni appunti sulle lezioni e sui loro docenti: il dott. Katznelson, do- cente di storia della Halacha, amava soffermarsi sulle condizioni sociali e religiose degli ebrei di Babilonia e Palestina in mezzo agli altri popoli. Laureato in medici- na, si ritrovava spesso a trattare quel tema nella cornice talmudica o a dissertare</page><page sequence="15">CACCI A AL TESORO DEI GUNZBURG 1 09 sulle leggi di purita nella Bibbia e nella tradizione, e sugli influssi della dottrina di Zoroastro. La storia del popolo ebraico era appannaggio del celebre Simon Dub- nov. Nel corso di un triennio - alle prese con la stesura dei suoi 10 volumi in ar- gomento - copri l'intero periodo fra Bibbia e XX secolo. Le sue conversazioni pubbliche si tenevano la sera del sabato e del giovedi in un'atmosfera elettrizzante. Aveva una dizione chiara e forte in un russo ricco e pittoresco. In aula compariva spesso Joseph Trumpeldor, l'eroe di Port Arthur assai popolare nel mondo ebraico. I seguaci del Sionismo socialista sapevano bene che il suo sogno era la creazione di una kevutza indipendente e autonoma in Palestina. Uno di quei giovedi sera Shazar se lo vide comparire in stanza vestito di tutto punto da militare (era un gior- no di festa nazionale). «Sono venuto a cambiarmi prima della lezione; questa divi- sa 'straniera' non si attaglia ai nostri studi di ebraismo». Gli allievi piu giovani pensavano che l'epoca degli studiosi 'tuttologi' dovesse cedere il passo alle specializzazioni e al lavoro di squadra. Ma Dubnov era del pa- rere opposto. Aveva una visione unitaria della storia ebraica, che considerava indi- visibile. Tutto doveva essere correlato da una mente centrale; gli specialisti poteva- no al piu fornire i mattoni. Cost, rifiutava addirittura di insegnare a quanti non ac- cettassero di impegnarsi su quella linea di globalita. Le sue conferenze pubbliche riguardavano il processo generale della storia, i seminari si occupavano dei particolari. In questo caso gli studenti si mettevano in circolo attorno a lui, uno di loro teneva il campo e il Maestro guidava la discussione. Infine, Dubnov usava passeggiare per la citta ogni giorno fra le 4 e le 5, accompagnato da uno dei disce- poli: altra occasione di arricchimento. Le cose si misero male quando una delegazione di studenti oso chiedere al Ma- estro, qualche settimana prima dell'esame, su quale periodo della storia dovessero concentrarsi. «Un buon ebreo - rispose, fierissimo - deve sentirsi a proprio agio su ogni periodo della propria storia». Una curiosa coppia di docenti era formata dal duo Karlin-Sliossberg. Rabbi A- rie Karlin, allievo a suo tempo delle yeshivot lituane, era diventato dentista per ot- tenere la residenza a San Pietroburgo senza dover concorrere a un posto di rabbino di Stato. II suo collega H.B. Sliossberg dopo gli studi in yeshiva era invece passato alia giurisprudenza per farsi avvocato della causa ebraica. Karlin sedeva a capota- vola, e apriva la discussione su un problema talmudico con davanti un tomo della Ghemara e a fianco un volume della «Yad Hazakka» di Maimonide; Slossberg vi intercalava riferimenti alle traduzioni russe e tedesche del Talmud e commenti giu- ridici in rapporto al Diritto romano e ai concetti della moderna legislazione in Rus- sia e in Occidente. Ma un grande Maestro era il Barone Gunzburg in persona. Nelle pagine del- l'Enciclopedia Ebraica, di cui curava Tedizione russa, aveva rifiutato - eccesso di modestia - persino di specificare la propria bibliografia nella voce che lo riguar- dava (e men che meno di inserirvi un ritratto). Le poche righe su di lui lo definiva- no docente alia Scuola di San Pietroburgo in «letteratura talmudica», letteratura rabbinica, letteratura araba, filologia semitica e filosofia religiosa». Nel primo anno di attivita, quando gli incontri si tenevano nel suo studio e gli altri docenti erano ancora lontani, in effetti il Barone insegnava tutto questo; e gli sarebbe piaciuto continuare, in quanto concepiva come Dubnov la cultura ebraica come una conti- nua interrelazione fra le varie parti; ma a differenza di Dubnov accettava di affida-</page><page sequence="16">1 10 LA RASSEGNA MENSILE DI ISRAEL re i diversi rami a diversi istruttori. Le sue lezioni ruotavano sul concetto del pensiero ebraico nei confronti con Dio, il mondo e il popolo ebraico stesso. Entrava in aula con una gran cartella pie- na di libri, senza mai preparare pagine scritte, ma pizzicava le citazioni e i com- menti ora da uno ora dall'altro di quella pila di volumi imbottiti di segnalini. Se parlava di filologia, pareva che nuotasse in un oceano di conoscenze. Era padrone - si diceva - di 36 lingue, con i relativi lessici e le relative sintassi; preceduto da uno dei suoi allievi carico di dizionari, vi scorazzava come un virtuoso del piano- forte sulla tastiera; metteva a confronto i varii lessici e il loro sviluppo, il percorso dei linguaggi. Non meno affascinanti erano le sue lezioni di grammatica, ma tutto questo non era che l'anticamera del palazzo dedicato alia Guida degli smarriti di Maimonide. Avrebbe voluto commentarlo sul testo originale (ma gli allievi erano troppo lenti nell'imparare Tarabo) in quanto Maimonide per lui rappresentava la fi- gura centrale e ideale nella storia dell'ebraismo. La biblioteca del Barone Gunzburg occupava tutta una fila di stanze, precedute dal suo studio privato, al centro del quale stava un tavolo coperto da montagne di libri, carte, prove di stampa. Alia parete, il ritratto di Maimonide. Gli piaceva di- scutere con i giovani; li trattava con riguardo per non avvilirli, ma cercava di sman- tellare ogni idea che gli paresse troppo 'moderna'. Ce l'aveva in particolare con i concetti di nazionalismo e di assimilazione: tanto e vero che non era possibile im- maginarli entro il mondo di Maimonide. Osteggiava anche l'idea - propostagli da un gruppo di giovani - di assoldare uno specialista nello studio socio-economico della diaspora (ce n'era uno molto noto a Vienna, tale Wischnitzer). «Ma come! voi siete venuti qui a studiare la natura e il destino del popolo ebraico, e ora mi chiedete che vi si insegni a quali occupazioni dovettero dedicarsi gli ebrei nei vari Paesi per sopravvivere! chiedereste notizie sulle entrate o sui pasti di Emanuele Kant invece di occuparvi della Ragion Pura e Ragion Pratica? e qui non si tratta di Kant, ma del Popolo scelto da Dio!». Se gli fosse accaduto di parlare della Spagna quattrocentesca - spiegava - certamente avrebbe dedicato un'ora a rievocare quanto essi fossero stimati e ben piazzati anche a Corte in quel paese prima della cacciata; ma per il resto dell'anno si sarebbe dedicato alle opere di Abrabanel. «A cosa vi serve conoscere il quando e il come fummo costretti a prestar denaro ai goym? tutto tempo rubato alio studio di questi libri !» e additava la fila delle dieci stanze ricolme di scaffali dal pavimento a soffitto. E tuttavia la settimana successiva sul muro della sala di riunione era affisso l'annuncio della venuta di un nuovo insegnante: per Tappunto Mark Wischnitzer, con un corso sulla Storia economica degli ebrei. Nell'autunno 1910, il Barone cadde ammalato: aveva solo 53 anni, ma a quel tempo non c 'erano i presidi medici di oggi. Trascorsi i giorni delle Grandi Solenni- ta, gli studenti deH'Accademia, ritrovatisi tutti a San Pietroburgo, si riunirono at- torno al suo letto. Fu, purtroppo, un addio, scandito dalla recita dei Salmi. Durante e dopo la Rivoluzione d'Ottobre furono vani i tentativi di far rinascere in forma permanente l'Accademia; docenti e discepoli - fra cui il predecessore di Shazar alia Presidenza dello Stato d'lsraele, Ben Zvi, e Rav Hanazir, un grande saggio dagli ascetici costumi, padre delTattuale gran rabbino di Haifa - approda- rono in Eretz Israel o si dispersero per il mondo.</page></plain_text>
