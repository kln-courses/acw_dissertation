         <title>Is the Night an Anthropological Object?</title>
         <p>Our investigation into the realm of the night began with this observation: entire sections of human social life are overlooked by anthropologists. It appears that anthropology has not yet been able to overcome the common assumption that the psychophysiological constraints of sleep cause a halt in thought and action, a general slowing down of life's rhythms, a decrease in energy expenditure, a collective “parenthesization” of society's activities in daytime, and even a kind of partial death, analogous to the seasonal cycles of plants. The idea of “nature's death” underlies many a mythology of the Old and the New Worlds. In Western thought, especially among the ancient Greeks, the night/death association goes with a kind of terror of shadow; in Homer's works, the night is seen as a “daily death” (Moreux 1967:268). For Aristotle, in the wake of Hesiod's speculations, the night emerges from a primitive being, a kind of absolute, vertiginous void (Aristotle 2002). In modern times, however, the concept of night has been rehabilitated by a philosophical tradition that flourished during the Sturm und Drang period with Herder and Goethe, then with Novalis and Schopenhauer, and even in Heidegger's phenomenology (Seitter 1999). Bronfen (2008) pointed out that psychoanalysis was the first discipline that drew systematically from nocturnal mental processes to explain psychic phenomena (Bronfen 2008).</p>
         <p>The night is approached in an ad hoc manner by different disciplines and different methodologies. For psychophysiologists, the object “night” is mostly linked to sleep (and to dreaming); for economists, the night is a focal point for expenditure relating primarily to security and protection. For urban ethnologists and geographers (see Bureau 1997), it is a matter of defining the transformations and developments induced by public activities qualified as “nocturnal” and their penetration into the diurnal world.<sup>2</sup> Other disciplines, such as comparative literature and history, have taken much more interest in the night (Ménager 2005; Verdon 1994). In the medieval world, darkness plays an important symbolic role as a metaphor of pagan obscurantism—deviancy, monstrosity, diabolism. But this approach does not adopt a holistic perspective that would relate each of these cultural aspects to a worldview—Christian, in this case. For anthropology, it involves the whole of human activity between sunset and sunrise, keeping to the strict astronomical definition.</p>
         <p>Anthropology has so far reduced night to a dimension of time. However, many societies very closely connect the spatial and temporal dimensions. The spatiotemporal domains of the night have their own specific properties distinct from daytime spaces. The parameters of widespread cosmological beliefs about the day-night cycle, including the character and status of the beings believed to inhabit the world of darkness, are indeed of a spatiotemporal nature (Steger and Brunt 2003<italic>b</italic>).</p>
         <p>A blind spot of anthropology is that the functions common to all humans, such as eating, procreating, or dying, constitute the substance of anthropology (rites of commensality, kinship systems, funeral rituals), and yet, curiously, the vital function of sleep has never been introduced, even though sleep deprivation proves to be lethal for animals and human beings alike. To quote a famous Lichtenberg aphorism, “Our entire history is only the history of waking men.” As Ekirch pointed out, “Whereas our daily lives are animated, volatile and highly differentiated, sleep seems, by contrast, passive, monotonous and uneventful” (Ekirch 2005:262). No one has yet produced a history of sleeping men. In traditional ethnography, the night only appears as a backdrop in the narration of ritual experiences. And yet, when those taking part in a ritual are subjected to grueling sleep deprivation to help them to hear the voices of ancestors or to see “visions” of other worlds, it is clear that the indigenous experts, by deliberately modifying the sleep cycles of the participants, provide them with access to altered states of consciousness and to a singular relationship with space and time that is inaccessible during the state of wakefulness. Therefore, night is often only mentioned in relation to ritual operations, attracting the observer's attention through their contents without considering the rituals in the context of the 24-hour day-night cycle, or nychthemeron.</p>
         <p>Anthropologists have never provided themselves with appropriate measuring tools to tackle the subject of sleep. In the study of human societies, the trend has been that sleep is not influenced by culture; however, more discriminating studies have shown that certain aspects of sleep are indeed shaped by culture. Some recent studies have attempted to describe national ways and customs, such as Brigitte Steger's monograph on sleeping habits in Japan and their shaping by social codes (Steger 2004). Research on dreams appears not to escape the same assumption that dreams take place when social life slows down, echoing the sleeper's immobility even though the mind's activity during dreams reveals particularly rich unconscious thought.<sup>3</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Although we do indeed have available information about beliefs and representations of the night, there is no body of work dedicated to the subject. Our aim is not to create such a corpus; we only want to show that the issue must be approached through different vantage points, each of which gives a complementary status to the object “night.” The question is, Should we consider the anthropology of the night as a “new frontier” in the discipline? Does this new subject require a special methodology?<sup>4</sup> One major theme is what happens to the human body during the night; as will be seen in the examples given farther on, it includes conceptions of the person, through both intra- and extracorporeal elements, sources and levels of energy, physical activity, and movement and motion, including involuntary movement during sleep. A second theme is nocturnal space-time and its distortion. A new framework must take into account spatial units—translated into terms of the night according to properties attributed to places (private, public, secret, forbidden)—and also temporal units that expand or contract through nocturnal experience and perception (apparitions, visions, dreams) or due to special characteristics (e.g., sentences for criminal acts committed at night).</p>
         <p>As a starting point, we adopt a simple definition of anthropology drawn from experience. By observing the customs and beliefs of ethnic groups of various shapes and sizes, anthropology examines how phenomena are perceived in the physical and social environments and how adjustments are made to both visible and invisible realities. Beyond representations, anthropology also studies cognition, including learning and the transmission of knowledge. Because of the unique character of the night, special terminology, analytic methods, and interpretations must be developed if the night is to become anthropologically visible.</p>
         <p>Also, we must assume that anthropology by its very nature is holistic and seeks to embrace diverse cultures. This has led us to seek the extremes of the cultural continuum, ranging from the Inuit of Nunavut to a dance troupe in a Parisian cabaret. Presenting such cases also enables us to show how the night offers a variety of representations and behaviors in different parts of the world. This universalistic premise led us to seek legitimacy for our hypotheses within psychophysiology, so we accordingly brought together disciplines and areas of research that rarely have the opportunity to meet.<sup>5</sup>
         </p>
         <p>But this endeavor has met with real difficulties. Throughout the discussions of the research group “Anthropology of the Night,” misunderstandings arose concerning the development of methodologies suitable for our respective areas. On the one hand, ethnographic findings remain extremely disparate and barely usable. On the other hand, what anthropology expects from psychophysiology—namely, a kind of repertory of parameters entailing for all human societies the same intangible requirements regarding sleep, motility, and perception—does not belong to that science. Although psychophysiologists suspect that cultural variation may have an influence on their clinical findings, they do not have the means to define, elucidate, and measure cultural parameters. Our essay attempts to explore these two disciplines, each with its own requirements, with a view to developing new methodologies.</p>
         <p>Research in psychophysiology highlights the variability of perception and physiological reactions during the night. First, on the physiological level, environmental conditions appear to play a more powerful role than might have been expected in the different ways societies experience them (relating to climate, seasons, population density). Second, on the cultural level, the way the human body reacts physiologically to nocturnal life appears, conversely, to have an impact on the way representations are construed and actions are ordered in the dark (as domestic customs regarding food and sleep, etc.). Then questions confronting anthropology are raised by studies of the psychophysiology of sleep. How do societies adapt to environmental conditions and seasonal variations, to unavoidable physiological constraints, and to flexibility in the individual and collective management of sleep? Besides, the anthropological approach should take into account genetic characteristics of some populations that could lead to changes in physiological features of sleep and in the propensity to fall asleep. However, in this respect, research on humans in an anthropological perspective is rare. Genetic characteristics could favor pathological alterations of sleep. An example is the prevalence of the antigene HLA-DR2 in narcoleptic patients.<sup>6</sup> The prevalence of HLA-DR2 and narcolepsy is higher in some populations (see, e.g., Jouvet and Gessain 1997 on Basari, an African population, and Mignot and Tafti 1998 on HLA-DR2 genetic prevalence in Japan). How much influence do social norms and cognitive styles of individual societies have on the perception and conceptualization of sleep and night? Anthropologists can provide examples of factors that may entail modifications of sleep-wake rhythms and related physiological activities. Daytime activities and rules for night can be important factors and can provide good examples of how “culture” could interfere with sleep.</p>
         <p>The inevitable questions are then (1) To what extent is sleep, this major occupation of the night, influenced by the variations in cultures? and (2) To what extent are our investigations mapped by neurological and physiological constraints? The laboratory is the place where experiments are conducted but also the place where the questions that define and delimit experiments are drawn up. We therefore judged it useful to borrow the elements most apt for transposition. Questionnaires have proved difficult to use. In the psychology department of the University of Florence, Toselli, Farneti, and Salzarulo (1998) built precise questionnaires on habits and beliefs relating to sleep. A similar protocol was used in a study of the indigenous Mayan people for a comparative survey. Preliminary results suggest conclusions in several areas, including the transposition of Western-style questionnaires to other cultures and possible adaptations that avoid distorting the intention of the survey or the results themselves.<sup>7</sup>
         </p>
         <p>On a behavioral level, cosleeping and parental attitudes toward the sleep of children arise out of beliefs about prenatal existence, bedtime routines, and sleep-related regimes of life and activity. This is another theme of crucial importance, with significant consequences for the rituals accompanying childbirth, couvade (a postnatal practice performed by fathers), and neonatal practices.</p>
         <p>The purposes of this essay therefore are twofold: to present the state of the art of anthropological thinking about the night and to lay out bases for cross-disciplinary discussion by outlining the expectations of each discipline. Research prospects are indicated, based on the analysis of both existing and unpublished findings by the project members. We will use examples from European and Amerindian communities to show similarities and differences in how spatiotemporal reality is perceived over the course of the 24-hour period. The impact of these examples lies in the number of different questions they raise, which one sole example could never do.</p>

         <title>Sleeping in the Night</title>
         <p>Most of the people all over the world sleep at night. Features of night sleep are well known consisting of a sequence of physiological activities (Keitman 1963). Some features, namely, the duration of the sleep episode and the dynamics of some activities, can be modulated by external factors. Yet there are limits to sleep changes: the sleep-wake rhythm and the episode's duration are more easily modified than are basic physiological components of sleep.</p>
         <sec id="sc2.1">
            <title>Fragmentation of Sleep</title>
            <p>In Western countries, where sleep has usually been studied, “ideal” sleep consists of an episode lasting 7–8 hours (see fig. 1), but it appears that this continuous way of sleeping could be relatively recent (Ekirch 2005).<sup>8</sup> To anthropologists, often not used to lying in their hammocks or camp beds for 7 or 8 hours running when in the field, one observation immediately springs to mind: “nights” seem less continuous than in their home countries. Among the Amerindians, from north to south, it is rare not to be interrupted during the night by one or another of the members of the household, for nobody seems to feel the slightest need to preserve a space free of noise, light, and activity. Bordin (2008), for one, shows that the sleeping schedule among the Inuit varies considerably with the latitude and the season but also among individuals. Are these cultural adjustments of sleep related to physiological phenomena? We will not decide between the hypotheses concerning the continuous versus discontinuous character of sleep in the history of mankind, which is still a debated issue (see Wehr 1991, 1996).<fig fig-type="figure" id="fg1" position="float">

            <p>Physiologists have investigated the architecture and characteristics of sleep by means of instruments that reveal that brain and body activities change across the sleep episode and that the sleep episode is not homogeneous. Moreover, since 1953, we have known that there are two basic states, rapid eye movement (REM) and non–rapid eye movement (NREM), the definitions of which take into account not only brain activity but also motor and neurovegetative activities. Sleep is clearly quite a complex and organized phenomenon. This organization is expressed at three different levels: the state (REM and NREM), the cycle consisting of a sequence of REM and NREM, and the sleep episode, which is made up of several bouts of both REM and NREM states. NREM-REM cycles follow each other four to five times across the sleep episode.</p>

            <title>Physical Environment</title>
            <p>While the impact of personal concerns or social interactions on sleep is fairly well acknowledged in the clinical domain, objective demonstration mainly concerns the physical environment. The variables of heat, light, and noise are factors that influence the quality of sleep. The question, How is one's sleep affected by one's environment? is a line of research to which ethnography could provide a certain number of answers. Indeed, field data express the behavioral modifications relating to seasonal variations associated with climatic conditions; connected activities play a role in the differentiated management of sleep. Drought (for the Amazonians) induces substantial changes in life rhythms: the rainy season is more propitious to the continuity of sleep than the dry season, during which the extreme coolness, ritual necessities, and the considerably longer transport times due to low waters require an increase in activity that eats into a large part of the night (Monod Becquelin 1975). For Inuit, the bright nights of late spring are favorable for traveling and hunting, so sleep is often deferred until the morning or full daytime (Bordin 2008). In our modern cities, sleep is most often organized by imperatives that now depend less on light or warmth. Heating, electricity, and the regulation of noise have modified the more “natural” rhythms that could, until recently, be found in the countryside: “early to bed and early to rise.” Many authors have worked on the urban characteristics of sleep and circadian rhythms, usually defined as a “24-h society” (Moore-Ede 1993). We can see such difference among peoples who have themselves changed their “style of night.” The Trumai, an Amerindian population of the Upper Xingu in Brazil, before getting to know a certain modernity—in terms of electricity, clock time—would stay awake longer two or three times a night and would take advantage of those breaks to go out of the house, urinate, chat, smoke the indigenous tobacco, court the secluded young girls, stoke up a dying fire, or go fishing. When they came into contact with watches, a few hours of electricity provided by generators, and beds instead of hammocks, their night became more continuous, and they do not bustle in and out anymore (Monod Becquelin, Guirardello, and de Vienne 2008).</p>
            <p>The factors that modify, induce, or prevent sleep, though difficult to measure, have been studied in the laboratory, but no ethnographic studies have been undertaken with the aim of describing precisely the time or mode of sleeping, with the exception of practices for inducing infants to sleep.<sup>9</sup> Anthropologists know more, on the other hand, about the conditions of forced wakefulness. This usually involves factors such as the consumption of certain hallucinogens and tobacco and conditioning in the form of fasting or preparatory rituals.</p>

            <title>What Happens to the Body during Sleep?</title>
            <p>While sleep is characterized by the absence of voluntary movements, there are several episodes of activity that involve both global and local motility. The body moves and changes position when the brain shifts from one cycle to the next. Small movements of the fingers and facial muscles are present during the REM phase, as well as the particular type of muscle activity linked to eye movements.<sup>10</sup>
            </p>
            <sec id="sc2.3.1">
               <title>Temperature.</title>
               <p>Under “standard” conditions, there is a close association between sleep and biological rhythms: sleep onset occurs when the core body temperature curve is decreasing, and waking up occurs when it is increasing. A model proposed by Feinberg (1974) and completed by Borbély (1982) shows the importance of the length of prior wakefulness for sleep duration and characteristics. The habitual decreasing trend across the sleep episode of a particular type of brain activity (slow wave activity) changes according to the duration of prior wakefulness, producing something called the S process. It is the interaction between the time course of the S process and the circadian rhythm of temperature that gives sleep its actual characteristics (Daan, Beersma, and Borbély 1984).</p>
               <p>Research has also investigated the effects on sleep structure of environmental temperature deviations from thermoneutrality: numerous long-lasting awakenings within the sleep episode and in reduced amounts of REM sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS) (Haskell et al. 1978; Karacan et al. 1978; Muzet, Libert, and Candas 1984). Furthermore, a low ambient temperature seems to affect sleep patterns to a larger extent than a high one (Haskell et al. 1981). Moreover, there is evidence that ambient temperature also affects the subjective estimation of sleep (Libert et al. 1991). If we know sleep characteristics quite well (in terms of process and organization) in a stable Western environment or in an experimental changed environment in the laboratory, there are few studies that show what happens in a “natural” changed environment with the same parameters, especially with different climatic conditions. Little is known, however, about autochthonous sleep in equatorial or polar areas, either quantitatively or qualitatively.</p>

            <sec id="sc2.3.2">
               <title>Noise.</title>
               <p>Depending on the intensity, duration, novelty, and emotional loading of the noise stimulus, sleep can be either “lightened” or interrupted for varying lengths of time, interacting with the mechanisms of sleep induction or maintenance, acting at different levels of physiological integration. In some cases, it is just the brain activity that is disturbed for a short time, while in other cases, individual neurovegetative functions, such as the cardiac rhythm, are modified. Noise-related awakening means that the process of sleep has been greatly disturbed; this is more likely if the noise occurs when the subject is in REM sleep or in stage 2 of NREM sleep.</p>
               <p>Although noise exposure and uncomfortable ambient temperatures show similar disruptive effects on sleep, studies comparing these two types of factors (Libert et al. 1991) suggest that high temperature affects sleep to a greater extent than noise, in agreement with subjective evaluations. This is the case among Inuit, for whom more discomfort is caused by a high ambient temperature—a healthy body should be dry and cool (Therrien 1995)—than by noise.<sup>11</sup> On the contrary, among the Maya, noise that is out of the ordinary appears to be a more important factor than heat in the interruption of sleep and it may be seen as signaling a supernatural event. Since the introduction of televisions, radios, and alarm clocks in the Mexican Mayan Highlands, it is common to hear these devices blaring out unexpectedly in the middle of the night without anyone appearing to be affected. But the least rustling in the garden, the slightest footfall on the path, will wake up the sleeper and cause agitation in the household (Roullet 1999). We need to look more carefully into the types of noises capable of interrupting sleep. Here again, a comparative exploration of cultural beliefs and reactions relating to nocturnal noise exposure is required.</p>

               <title>Light.</title>
               <p>Habitually, sleep-wake rhythm follows environmental light-dark alternation.<sup>12</sup> A study by Wehr (1991) performed in the laboratory found, after the alteration of the photoperiod (10 hours of light and 14 hours of darkness) for 4 weeks, changes in the length of the sleep episode and its precise location while its internal structure is not deeply modified. Psychophysiological research (Buguet, Rivolier, and Jouvet 1987) has not shown any specific alterations of sleep structure; basic sleep states are conserved, with only their proportions possibly changing (Wehr 1996). Czeisler et al. (1986, 1989) induced a reset of circadian rhythms by means of bright light exposure: an early morning administration induced a phase advance, whereas evening administration produced a phase delay. The role of the light-dark cycle in entraining biological rhythms has been highlighted by studies that suppressed the alternation between light and dark. An experiment with a constant dim light condition lasting 21 days (Middleton, Arendt, and Stone 1996) showed that subjects developed a sleep-wake rhythm longer than 24 hours.<sup>13</sup>
               </p>
               <p>An interesting experimental approach in natural conditions was performed by Steel et al. (1995). These authors found free-running sleep-wake cycles longer than 24 hours and internal desynchronization in subjects who lived in an Arctic research camp; the natural environment permitted isolation under constant daylight and at the same time ensured that the study had high ecological validity. A clear modification of sleep-wake rhythms was found by a Japanese group (Usui et al. 2000) in a recent sleep log–based study in the Antarctic. The results show unusual sleep onset and waking up times: sleep is poorly synchronized to the 24-hour cycle, and the number of daytime sleep episodes increases. Some clinical approaches have evoked symptoms such as difficulty in falling asleep and sleep interruptions presented by Westerners living for a certain time in the Antarctic. These have been collectively called polar insomnia (Bogoslovskii and Letter 1974). A critical review of this concept based on ethnolinguistic Inuktitut can be found in Bordin's study (2008). The interest in these observations is also related to the long-time exposure to a “special” environment, such as that habitually experienced by populations living above the Arctic Circle. Few studies provide relevant information about these people. What is the result of dysfunction or adaptation in a Western group put in other conditions than their own? Is it similar or different in people living permanently in the same type of conditions?</p>

               <title>Time-Free Environment.</title>
               <p>Biological rhythms, including sleep-wake alternation, are driven by an endogenous circadian clock and synchronized by environmental periodic changes. The role of external cues in entraining the biological rhythms has been ascertained by experimental work from the 1960s. A fundamental contribution to this topic was provided by Jürgen Aschoff and his colleagues (Aschoff 1965; Aschoff, Gerecke, and Wever 1967), who conducted their experiments in a bunker, isolating human subjects for a long period (about 1 month) from the natural cyclic changes in sunlight and from other time cues (such as knowledge of the time, social contacts, etc.).<sup>14</sup> Subjects under isolation showed a longer sleep-wake rhythm periodicity than that observed under laboratory conditions (about 25 hours, free-running sleep-wake rhythm). It was also observed that the majority of subjects develop a different relationship between sleep-wake phases and core body temperature rhythms: sleep begins close to the minimum temperature value (i.e., much later than in the usual environment) but ceases, as usual, when the temperature curve is rising, with a consequent reduction in sleep duration. Moreover, a dissociation between core body temperature and sleep-wake rhythms, called internal desynchronization, could be observed in a substantial number of subjects. Subsequently, it has been emphasized that the feeding and rest activity schedule also can act as an environmental synchronizer (Czeisler et al. 1981).<sup>15</sup>
               </p>
               <p>Each of these parameters should be subjected to parallel studies investigating the questions specific to research into sleep in relation to the night. Whether we look at the fragmentation of nocturnal sleep or the relationship with noise, light, and temperature, we shall soon see that all these data are the results of representations, constraints, and cultural manipulations that need to be elucidated. That is why our project runs in tropical, equatorial, and Arctic regions and Western and “exotic” populations, with and without electric light, urban noises, and so forth. Without knowing the basic psychophysiological facts concerning sleep, any inquiry about night regulation and related beliefs would be meaningless. As regards physiological data on sleep states and durations, there are instruments (such as wrist actigraphs) that are not overly intrusive and that seem promising for the gathering of comparative data among the ethnographic or indigenous populations and utilizable by psychophysiologists.</p>

            <title>Sleep, Dreams, Memory: Fieldwork and Cross-Disciplinary Confrontations</title>
            <p>What we know about sleep is based on specific laboratory survey protocols. Should we not envisage sleep as one of the constituent elements of the object “night,” culturally adaptable, within certain limits that should be explored in each case? One reason we should is that in most societies, sleep is linked with dreams and dreams with knowledge and memory. Can night activity be centered on the idea of “visions” recounted in narratives of travel, combat, or announcements as omens?<sup>16</sup> Or on the idea of the imaginary world subjected to the necessary deconstruction of the diurnal world before the return of morning? One of the Mayan theories about sleep and dreaming, as for many other Amerindian populations, considers that the traveling soul communicates images of the landscapes and situations it encounters to the sleeping body, thus setting the rhythm of the body's nocturnal activity (Tedlock 1987<italic>a</italic>). Among the Inuit, the shadow component of the person leaves the body during sleep and travels through space, in particular to the land of the dead, and this engenders dreams.</p>
            <p>The relations that exist between diurnal knowledge and nocturnal mental activity remain enigmatic: apart from dreams and their interpretation, in every society and culture, there are hypotheses concerning the relations between the nocturnal activity of the mind and knowledge, and the modes of its acquisition, conservation, or transformation during the night. Much specific knowledge is only considered valid because it has been acquired during the night. What is “nocturnal knowledge,” and what is the epistemic value attributed to its nature and transmission? As far back as ancient Greece, this question was at the heart of Artemidorus's <italic>Oneirocriticon</italic> (1975).</p>
            <p>If there are cultural ways of reasoning in relation to the night, then we must take these events into consideration, and we must find an “added value” to set this approach apart from standard research studies. “Nocturnal” tools must be forged in the same way as terms more familiar to anthropologists such as “cross-cousins” or “predation.” We could introduce first the expression “nocturnity” and bring together under this term all the events and actions that display the modalities of nocturnal activities: drunkenness, fear, isolation, sickness, fainting, visions, healing, and certain types of possession. Step by step, this will lead us to develop an ethnographic approach to nocturnity. As regards the integrity of the person: Is the bodily envelope more fragile during nocturnal episodes? Is this a question of greater vulnerability to external aggression? From the point of view of self-perception, can we consider—in the style of Goffman's (1959) theory, but in reverse—that the withdrawal from public sphere to private sphere is synonymous with a transformation of the social roles played in diurnal exhibition? And how should we take these boundaries into account? The difficulties inherent in this approach are considerable: quite apart from the problems connected with the study of sleep, and those connected with the researcher's need for rest, the basic fieldwork on real sleep in natural environments is still largely missing.</p>
            <p>Each example presented here serves to clarify one element of the whole, depending not only on the geographical and cultural situation of the object but also on the methodological orientation of the researcher engaged in the survey. When we use the term “field,” we are referring to a multiplicity of contexts requiring cross-disciplinary definitions. Is the laboratory a field in the same way as is an Amerindian village? On what grounds can we claim to be adopting an experimental approach? This raises the problem of different types of observation, the question of the measurement of these data, and the application of the comparative method. We do not yet know whether all societies throughout the world share the same set of physical and cognitive mechanisms of control, adaptation, and perception of sleep and its relationship to night.</p>
            <p>The “night” ethnographer finds himself or herself faced with four sets of data: (1) physical and climatic data, such as records of temperatures, sunrise and sunset, and lunar phases; (2) results of direct observation, which does have serious limits: such as the observer who must, at some time or another, go to sleep and restricted access to certain areas; (3) experimental data, in collaboration with physiologists, consisting in precise actimeter records of phases of waking and sleep, in different seasons and situations; and (4) the “words” collected from interviews, dialogues, and narrations of dreams that play a fundamental role because of the limits just mentioned.</p>

         <title>Stories of the Night</title>
         <p>Myths about the creation of the night (usually, as opposed to the day) are not only common but are primary and fundamental in most, if not all, cultures. We do not propose, like James Frazer or Mircea Eliade did, to analyze extensive sets of myths—in this case, those relating to the origin of the night—but to focus on a single myth, analyzed for this purpose, in order to extract a few questions that a cursory reading raises.<sup>17</sup>
         </p>
         <sec id="sc3.1">
            <title>A Myth about the Origins of the Night</title>
            <p>As an example of an origin myth, we present the main features of the Yucunas' frame of reference with regard to the night in the myth of the Karipú Lakená (the four demiurges). We briefly relate this myth to the Yucuna organization of nocturnal life and conclude with an ethnographic description of the powers and the senses that the night is believed to awaken.<sup>18</sup>
            </p>
            <p>After having created the world, the Karipú Lakená receive the Night from Tapúrina, the Lord of Dreams. When they go to see this Lord, the heroes ask for “this thing” to “measure the time,” in other words, to avoid “eating at no matter what time the food.” Tapúrina warns them that the night might “prevail” and “destroy” no matter who, “expose them to evils,” and make people older. As always, Lajmuchí (the youngest and most mischievous of the four brothers) is not convinced and says that “under [the influence] of the night, we could get rid of illnesses and reorganize the world after someone's death.” The Lord no longer refuses the brothers' request, and it establishes the new conditions of existence in this world. The four heroes choose a small nut, which contains a two-meal period of darkness.<sup>19</sup> The Lord advises them always to prevent the night from dominating them, by sleeping only after midnight, “when everything is silent,” to avoid being disturbed by enemy spirits, very active before this time. They are also forbidden from stopping on the way home to open the nut. But halfway home, Lajmuchí opens the nut a little. During this primordial night, the Karipú Lakená change into or bring forth various animals (squirrels, tinamous, crickets, parakeets, lizards, snakes), which explains why these animals appear at certain times during the night. When the brothers return home, they open the nut completely, to terminate the “regulation” of the night. Nevertheless, they fail to protect humans against all the harmful effects of the night. Many beings, surprised by the sudden darkness provoked by Lajmuchí, turn themselves into monsters (Fontaine 2008).</p>
            <p>Night, sleep, time schedule, ecological calendar, rituals, sexuality, metamorphoses, and correlated specific injunctions, behavioral as well as ritual, including the transmission of knowledge: many nocturnal themes are found here. Recounting such a myth, the narrator is reminding the listeners of their own ontology and therefore of their obligations as set down by the all-powerful beings of mythology which govern nocturnal activities: (1) The night must be spent at home, in relative safety. At night, all walks or pauses in the forest are to be avoided. (2) Meals are to be taken preferably at the start and the end of the night, enabling the rest of the time to be organized for other tasks. (3) Men must share coca and learn to stay awake as long as possible to protect their homes from any attack. (4) The transmission of knowledge (mythology, songs, shamanism) belongs exclusively to the night period, on condition of staying awake and sharing coca. (5) The shamans are chiefly responsible for ensuring protection. After midnight, when the others have gone to bed, they deliver long incantations to forestall dangers, treat their patients, and “reorder” the world.</p>
            <p>Such an organization of nocturnal activities protects the community against the supposed dangers of weak night vision while fully exploiting the other senses. (1) Taste and smell are given prominence in the meals served in the half-light, without forgetting the spiritual foods of men, coca and tobacco. (2) The sense of hearing is constantly tested, both through the importance attached to the spoken word and through moments of silence. The hearing of shamans is held to be so highly developed that there is no need for any speech: they can detect the slightest thought or “internal language.” (3) Touch is also stimulated because this sense makes it possible to identify objects and subjects. Tactile signals are extremely frequent when social relations take place in the darkness.</p>
            <p>While most people allow themselves to be dominated by the night—by falling asleep—the shamans control the darkness and exploit its effects to the maximum. It is believed that at night, nonhuman beings are willing, under certain conditions, to communicate with humans: the shamans can share specific sensibilities with these beings. Yukuna themselves connect by the emphasis laid on the senses, the metabolic and physiological transformations that occur during night and sleep to the alteration of sensation and perception in nocturnal experiences.</p>

            <title>Night Words</title>
            <p>Night words are categorized by the time of night when they occur. Many ethnographies describe the importance of night words.</p>
            <p>The first category is the recitation that is linked to a particular moment in time. In the song cycles of the Javari, for example, in important Amazonian intertribal ceremonials (Upper Xingu, Brazil), the ritual songs are strictly arranged according to the stars and the cries of the animals mentioned in the songs (Basso 1985; Monod Becquelin 1975): the songs of the night are performed according to when certain birds begin their songs. For narrations, the Inuit favor the time of the winter solstice, the darkest period of the year. The narrations' power was called on to overcome winter food shortages, to encourage the return of the sun, and to revive fertility.<sup>20</sup>
            </p>
            <p>In some cases, when a ritual or song is recited depends on the power attributed to the words: words are linked to the danger they represent when pronouncing names that attract outside beings, either summoned or uninvited. In northern Amerindian cultures, there are prohibitions linked to the efficacy of the mythic word (Graham 1995; Radin 1969).</p>
            <p>Words exchanged at night are not necessarily of an intimate nature. In Amazonia, in the communal house where 60–80 people live, although subtle arrangements such as the orientation of hammocks and the placing of each family's fire create private territories as effectively as walls might, the intimacy of sexual intercourse, for example, is much better respected in the plantation or during bathing than within a dark and enclosed space.</p>
            <p>But night words are also the ones referring to the night, not only recommendations to children or comments offered to ethnologists but also those that convey something of the night, be it experiences, visions, tales of dreams, or old-time myths.</p>
            <p>Among Amerindians, the dream reigns to such an extent that it is universally connected with power, but its force and effectiveness are largely derived from a rich nocturnal source: the dreams of great shamans, healers, and chiefs. There can be no question of exploring the actual contents of this world of dream words but only of pinpointing its imperious presence, expressed through its effects on daily life. Night, sleep, dream: this is the Amerindian trilogy of power and the sacred whose threads we must untangle.<sup>21</sup>
            </p>
            <p>The study of dream narrations shows singular features that belong only to this type of narration or to specifically related ones. For the Xavante, a Gê tribe from Brazil (Graham 1986, 1994, 1995), dream narration varies according to gender and stage in the life cycle (the old men combine these dream stories with myths). Dreams are often associated with myths, but they can also be combined with songs and dances, as among the Temiar of Malaysia (Roseman 1991). Do the three forms of dream narration found among the Sambia of Melanesia depend uniquely on the types of social situation indicated (Herdt 1987)? These communicative contexts during which the dreams are shared are indispensable for understanding the transition that is so delicate, even in enunciation, between the “science of day” and that of the night. The constraints imposed on Tzotzil narrations vary from the prescriptive and inevitable (Laughlin 1976) to the secret or unspeakable. The process of narration of nocturnal events generally makes considerable use of grammatical, rhetorical, lexical, and prosodic tools such as mediatives, assonances, homonymy, metaphors, images, and associations. It is significant to know whether the speaker is narrating, reciting, or chanting or whether dream segments are being “piled up,” as in the case of the Australian dream narration reported by Glowczeski (1999), where the text takes the form of a topographical description without order or chronology as is found in daily life. In Cuzco Quechua, dream and myth bring into play a particular temporal marker, the suffix -<italic>sqa</italic>, which connotes narrative events not directly experienced by the speaker in a normal state (Itier 2004). In Kagwahiv Parintintin, there is a specific tense for dream recital (Kracke 1979). The Quiché, on the contrary, employ transitive verbs to indicate—through use of the obligatory ergative with transitives—that the dreamer is acting within his dream; in addition, the use of the citative indicates a freed soul, detached from the individual subject experiencing the dream, unless the dream is very positive, in which case the citative is no longer used. The Zuni use verbal forms that make explicit the psychological and ontological orientations of the dream (Tedlock 1987<italic>b</italic>). It is clear from this that the status of truth and the epistemic judgment of knowledge—direct or indirect—cannot be disassociated from detailed research in relation to nocturnal realities. There are thus many examples of the variety of influences on the language exerted by night words or words referring to the night.</p>

         <title>The Shadows of the Mayan Night</title>
         <p>In the Mesoamerican and Andean areas, the violence of colonial history has confined indigenous knowledge and practices to the hidden recesses of the night, to the point where it has become the favored place for the expression of a dominated culture. The specificity of nocturnal practices among the Tzeltal of the Chiapas Highlands (Mexico) lies in the process of adaptation of the nocturnal experience not only with the worldview and the local conceptions of the person but also with the political transformations of the native communities.</p>
         <sec id="sc4.1">
            <title>Two Nocturnal Visions: Tenejapa and Bachajón</title>
            <p>Although the two villages from which the data are drawn, Tenejapa and Bachajón, belong to the same Maya-Tzeltal cultural area, they present significant differences in terms of geographical situation, colonial and postcolonial history, social organization, and even cosmological beliefs. In particular, night representations form two very different patterns in these two ethnically and linguistically homogeneous communities. For each village, we have focused on one of the subjects raised most spontaneously during interviews about the night with different interlocutors.</p>
            <p>In Tenejapa the observer notices the apparent ease with which both adults and children speak of the night, of dreams and of the dangers associated with them. In addition to dreams, the nocturnal experiences most often narrated are encounters with supernatural and malevolent beings. The archetype of these entities is the <italic>ijk'al</italic> or “black man,” a small, hairy, and aggressive being who steals women and goods from the men of the village.</p>
            <p>The stories of <italic>ijk'al</italic>, whether they are presented as recent, proven facts or as past events whose truth status remains ambiguous, all follow the same template. During the night, the wandering soul of the sleeper or of a conscious person is attacked by an <italic>ijk'al</italic>; the person loses consciousness and wakes up, if the victim is a man, in an isolated spot—most often a cave—robbed of all the goods he had with him, ill, and sometimes projected into another space-time. In the case of a woman, she is sexually assaulted and is held captive in the depths of the earth, where the <italic>ijk'al</italic> are believed to live. She manages to escape years after the abduction and returns to the village to tell of her misadventure. In both cases, the villagers organize punitive expeditions against the community of <italic>ijk'al</italic>.</p>
            <p>
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>L., a young woman, describes her grandfather's and his companion's unlucky encounter: “They saw something move, but they could not see what it was. It was dark and misty. They started walking again, but someone, or some animal, was following them. Then, at the next crossroads, they were attacked. The <italic>ijk'al</italic> stole my grandfather's and his companion's goods. My grandfather saw an <italic>ijk'al</italic>; it even spoke to him in Spanish. It was small: they can jump into trees. They ran off into the mountain. Then my grandfather fell ill.” (J. Roullet, personal communication)</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Unlike in the folk tales, the feeling of temporal and affective closeness (one of the protagonists being a member of the speaker's family) adds a new dimension: the character of the <italic>ijk'al</italic>, a nocturnal icon, is invested with great emotion. He is the object of all fears and provides not only a way to examine all the events of daily life (theft, loss, conflicts) but also a figure on which to unload one's distress.</p>
            <p>The <italic>Tenejapanecos</italic> conceive the night not only as a place of social activity and exchange, in which it appears that a whole set of problems specific to community life can be shaped and examined (social norms/magic vengeance/relations with the outside world), but also as a space for revitalizing collective memory.</p>
            <p>In Bachajón, apart from a few elders and ritual specialists, hardly anyone seems to share the same discourse on nocturnal events. To a far greater extent than among the Tenejapa, the night is associated with <italic>pukuj</italic>, that is to say, extremely violent emotions and acts that may be the consequence either of diurnal or nocturnal events (attacks, suspicious movements, or noises, a drunk wandering down the road, the threat of an attack by wild animals) or of the states they engender (sickness/death) and the practices of power associated with these states (witchcraft and shamanic healing). Here, we present the chain of events that followed the recital of a dream by one of the members of a family.</p>
            <p>
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>P. and X. are mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, respectively. Their relationship, of a hierarchical nature, is often conflictual.</p>
                  <p>One morning, P. turned up on the doorstep and told her daughter-in-law, with ceremony and emotion, that “she had seen her in a dream, dressed like a <italic>mestiza</italic> and wearing outrageous make-up.” In the dream, P. reproached X. for her appearance, but her stepdaughter laughed in her face.</p>
                  <p>P. returned to her house without further comment. Her daughter-in-law did not appear to be affected by what she had just heard: she offered her some tortillas, as she did every morning. During the morning, however, this dream was recounted to all the members of the family: they all mentioned the possible threat of a misfortune to come. X. appeared to become more and more worried and distracted. Her mother-in-law, P., seemed to be very affected, for she believed that the dream announced a serious problem for the family.</p>
                  <p>At the end of the day, emotions were running high: with the men home, this bad dream was once more evoked. P., feeling slightly dizzy, thought that she was suffering from a <italic>k'exlal</italic> (sickness of shame), following the recital of her dream, and asked her grandson to perform a ritual to appease it. The sequence of events quickly unfolded: one by one, her daughter-in-law, one of her granddaughters, and the wife of her grandson all felt the same symptoms and were in turn treated. Everyone went to bed feeling nervous. Noises in the coffee field next to the house in the middle of the night added extra weight to the anguished atmosphere: the young men went to check that no intruders, human or monster, had penetrated into the safe haven of the <italic>sitio</italic>. This tension persisted during several days and nights, affecting all the family members, whose dreams, nocturnal doings, and meetings were examined in greater detail than usual. (J. Roullet, fieldnote)</p>

            </p>
            <p>The night in Bachajón is a space-time whose specific characteristics affect diurnal organization, with unpredictable consequences. This possible incursion of the night and its dangers into the diurnal world is a source of great anxiety. The dream, which is basically, for the Tzeltal, a transcription of the nocturnal activities of certain spiritual components of the person and their exchanges with nonhuman entities, eludes human “control.” It should be noted that individuals suffer from “shame” after the occurrence of such an incident: does this mean that nocturnal events, in their apparent “chaos,” enable individuals to grasp, reflectively and under cover of nocturnal metamorphosis, a deeper problematic about the nature of the person and his or her place within a community? Are beings constantly subjected to cosmic forces? It is likely that the night will prove to be a favorable frame for exploring Tzeltal conceptions of the person and his relations with the world and surrounding individuals.</p>
            <p>Certainly, the Tenejapa night is worrying and often threatening. But it appears to be a relatively well-defined cultural item, enshrined in narratives that have become veritable references. The Bachajón example tends to highlight the interweaving into daily Tzeltal life of disturbing, intimate nocturnal events that often remain without answer and that have a significant impact both emotionally (distress, panic, illness) and socially (the undermining of shared values, threats of witchcraft, settling of old scores), giving impetus to a complex system of power struggles, not only between humans—on both an inter-ethnic and intra-individual level—but also between humans and nonhumans.</p>
            <p>In Tenejapa, the emphasis is put on stereotyped visions of nocturnal dangers. In Bachajón, the night is also culturally both very well-defined and invested, but little structure is imposed on narrations. “Nocturnity” changes the nature of events and endows them with a different function from that which they would have in normal diurnal life, according to the sociological context of the community.</p>
            <p>The example of the Otomi deepens the theme of nocturnity as a general frame that encompass all aspects of the native culture, as a basic reference for thought and action.</p>

         <title>The Otomi Night: “The House of Darkness”</title>
         <p>To the Mexican Otomi, the image of the night encapsulates all of the representations about the body, society, and the world. The sixteenth-century cosmographer Thevet remarked: “The Popoloca worship the sun as the Otomi worship the moon.”<sup>22</sup> Still today, the metaphor <italic>ngu besui</italic> (house of darkness) refers to a dark universe as an image of a house. Actually, night is the indispensable backdrop for examining questions pertinent to their ontology: Who am I? What is the difference between a human, an animal, and a plant? The reality of the “outside world” is a constant preoccupation of our interlocutors. Not one nighttime walk or pilgrimage goes by without this insistent question being asked: Who is there? Is it a table companion? An ancestor? A jaguar (species that disappeared two generations ago)? There could be no reply to this set of questions without the idea of intense activity during the night, between the evening twilight and the dawn twilight. Not only are the events that take place during this time recorded, obeying a scenario known to everyone, but their characteristics suffice to explain phenomena that are incomprehensible by day. Chief among these is the principle of metamorphosis, with all it implies: reversal of categories and genders, destruction and reconstruction, changes of scale, acoustic or cenesthesic modifications. The Otomi recognize two types of perception: that of the daytime, when they do not confuse a stone with an ancestor or a tree with a jaguar; and another, that of the night, whether they are awake, sleeping, or dreaming, when another type of consciousness and feeling takes over.<sup>23</sup> The key to the system is the <italic>nahual</italic>, which can be defined as both the animal double and the metamorphosed man. But this process of transformation requires the expenditure of a certain quantum of energy. For this reason, <italic>nzahki</italic> (force) plays a fundamental role at this moment.<sup>24</sup> The fact that the components of the psychic apparatus (considered a material element of the body) become extremely plastic and unstable at night explains the particular power of this physicalist doctrine: (1) The laws of nature apply to all living beings, whether they are animal, vegetable, or human. The <italic>ídolos</italic>, the anthropomorphic representations of nocturnal entities, cover all three kingdoms. (2) The boundaries of the body are not psychic boundaries but only “skins,” in other words, places where entities that have come from elsewhere mark their presence. The consequence of this association/dissociation is that the mind possesses the same property of ubiquity, whence also the instability of the effects during the night, swinging between moments of uncontrolled violence, passivity, and affliction. The subject immediately finds himself subordinated to external forces.<sup>25</sup> If one postulates the existence of a theory of nocturnal knowledge, this is very much a shared theory and not simply the knowledge of experts like the shaman. However, the shaman is clearly the only person who can cut out these figures that are so many agencies of the world of darkness and that must imperatively be thrown into the bush (Dow 1986<italic>a</italic>, 1986<italic>b</italic>). The representation of bodily mutilation is a particularly intriguing aspect of the iconography of nocturnal psychic life. A large number of the paper figures have bodies without heads, arms, or legs. These characteristics are the proof that all these entities have undergone a sacrificial process, bringing about a change in their status. Night is the indispensable setting for this transition. This nocturnal body serves to display, but upside-down and during the nighttime, all the characteristics of the human being. Thus, the Otomi reject a closed view of the individual, the subject simply transmitting knowledge from the night world, the world down below, “on the other side,” which the shamans can make explicit in their therapeutic practices. At night, the body is totally open to the world and can be dismembered, sacrificed, and put together again, in a word, totally ensnared in the feminine and maternal <italic>su</italic>, “that which terrifies” but which allows the birth of the living through an act of sacrifice, in the “Old Bag,” the place where individual representations disappear. It is also significant that Old Bag plays a part in the Carnival, in a human form that speaks in an obscene manner; from whence comes the idea of a sexual dimension to this nocturnal sacrifice.<sup>26</sup> 
            <italic>Tözâ</italic> is therefore the most spectacular expression of what may be an ethnic unconscious, encompassing men and nature. For the Otomi, we could sum up this doctrine in a chiasmus: either the world is a macro-human space or man is a universe in miniature (a belief strengthened by the fact that it is said of a pregnant woman's stomach that “it contains a village,” with its population of dwarfs). This idea brings us back to the maternal as nocturnal container and to the cultural model we evoked. In that way, Otomi offer us a system of thought based on a hierarchical ordering of levels of knowledge and cultural visibility. The nocturnal (lunar) metaphor encapsulates a set of features that mark all the processes of inversion and reconstitution of genders, of dissociation, of changes in scale, and of the polarization of opposites. The understanding of diurnal phenomena is literally deduced from what happens during the nocturnal space-time, in particular, the principle of the swallowing up of the masculine (diurnal) in the feminine (nocturnal).</p>

         <title>Darkness and Light of the Inuit Night</title>
         <p>Many Westerners, when the Inuit night, or night in the Arctic regions, is evoked, tend to think of the Arctic night, which is a seasonal and not a daily phenomenon. Although this phenomenon does exist and increases as the latitude rises, it has generated, such as it is, many stereotypes enclosed in a radically binary view of the high-latitude environment: the Arctic night versus the midnight sun, winter versus summer. As far as they are concerned, the Inuit experience a succession of states marked by the changes in astronomical, climatic, and biological conditions whose continuity they emphasize by strongly marking the natural and social cycles.</p>
         <sec id="sc6.1">
            <title>Winter Is Not a Long Night</title>
            <p>The Arctic night is astronomically a night, being the time between sunset and sunrise, but it lasts longer than 24 hours. Western representations commonly refer to it as a “long continuous night,” the obvious implication being that in the winter the inhabitants of the Arctic live permanently “in the night,” a night that is, moreover, supposed to be terrifying, pathogenic, and anxiogenic. The Inuit, however, have a different representation, and they say so. Beyond the facts of heavenly mechanics, the night does in fact return at each nychthemeron of the year, including north of the Arctic Circle. There is no “Arctic night” as such for the Inuit. There is in the winter, in the regions concerned, a period of darkness, referred to, in the northern part of Baffin Island, as <italic>tauvigjuaq</italic>, literally, “the long period of lightless days.”</p>
            <p>In spite of the real difficulties it entails for some aspects of daily life, the <italic>tauvigjuaq</italic> darkness eventually fades out and disappears; therefore, it must be endured, pending the return of light, as it is known that the perpetual darkness of primordial times is no more. Besides, the darkness is not uniform over night and day; it may even prove useful and even indispensable in some situations, as Ross (1835:268) observed in his days among the Natsilingmiut: “[That] which gave us pleasure [the Sun's return] had no such effect on the Esquimaux, to whom the night of this region is their day … since it is far more value to them in hunting the cunning and cautious seals. [They] always return home when the day broke, complaining of the light as their ennemy.”</p>

            <title>Dichotomy between Darkness and Night</title>
            <p>The Arctic setting of the Inuit territories constitutes a unique framework for the alternance of day (<italic>ulluq</italic>) and night (<italic>unnuaq</italic>), of light (<italic>qaumajuq</italic>) and darkness (<italic>taaq</italic>), and all the more so as the latitude rises. Thus night and darkness are dissociated, even though they fall into phase again at regular intervals in some regions or seasons. Sometimes darkness invades the day, sometimes the light floods the night: <italic>taarnirmik unnuangujjutiqanngimmat</italic> “the night does not have darkness as its cause,” and <italic>ulluujjutiqanngimmingmat qaumajutuinnarmik</italic> “the day does not have only light as cause,” says a speaker from Mittimatalik (Bordin 2005<italic>b</italic>).<sup>27</sup> The linguistic forms use the morpheme -<italic>jjuti</italic> (cause, grounds), expressing unequivocally that darkness and light are not (the only) indications of the arrival of the night or the day.</p>
            <p>In the southernmost regions, such as Nunavik (Arctic Quebec), the distinctive physical phenomena of the high latitudes do not exist, and every night contains a period of darkness, more or less long and deep, but always present; here, <italic>unnuaq</italic> denotes all nights. In the high latitudes, <italic>unnuaq</italic> is then used exclusively for the dark night. In the north of Baffin Island, there is a specific term, <italic>unnuattak</italic>, to designate the bright nights of spring (Bordin 2002): despite the sunlight, it is not the day, whence the use of the lexeme <italic>unnua</italic>-, showing that this is a nocturnal episode but that this is not the “ordinary” dark night, whence the correction by means of a morpheme, -<italic>ttak</italic>, “being like.” Hence, the night is not defined solely by darkness; it is characterized by a number of elements that pertain to more or less normative frames, whether physiological, social, or physical. The night is a knowledge acquired from infancy; it is denoted by a bodily sensation; it is bounded by a series of environmental markers; it is the time supposedly devoted to sleep.</p>

            <title>Night and Sleep</title>
            <p>In this study, one fundamental question concerns the relation between night and sleep. To understand this relation in this society, we cannot ignore what we might call a “theory” of sleep, on the one hand, and seasonal variations in individual and collective experience on the other, particularly above the Arctic Circle. On the whole, sleep is not valued by the Inuit, who have never really sought to enhance its status. Sleeping too long, for example, was and still is frowned upon because it is detrimental to the success of the hunt. Those who slept too long ran the risk of shortening their lives. Currently, the elders lament what they call their “baby sleepers,” their 20–40-year-old sons and daughters. In the context of today's partitioned homes, going to sleep means, for some, finding themselves alone in a bed, or even in a room, which is never appreciated, whence the practice of leaving the door open or the light on all night. Sleeping also brings the danger that the invisible component of the person might leave the body to go wandering and might not return to the body in time, with potentially disastrous consequences. Sleeping is also the fear of undergoing a form of sleep paralysis (<italic>aqtuqsinniq</italic>), a parasomnia common among the Inuit that is contemplated with genuine apprehension, especially by those who have no one by their side (Kolb and Law 2001). The bright nights of spring and summer are “extraordinary” (a specific word is used to denote them) and beneficial, for they enable people to do things that are difficult or impossible during dark nights: freedom of movement appears to be limitless, until tiredness brings on sleep. This night without darkness is even considered more favorable than the day. So sleep is often put off until the early hours.</p>
            <p>In winter, it is the dark days that are “abnormal” (and for which there is also a specific term). But unlike the nights of spring, these dark days are nonbeneficial, as they greatly limit outdoor activities. Traveling and hunting are difficult during this period, which is also the moment of the great celebrations and long nights of festivity. Once again, sleep is often put off until the early hours. Although we may be oversimplifying a little, it is as if sleep, which is little valued, is postponed during “abnormal” periods of the nychthemeron in order to take maximum advantage of the bright nights of spring and to suffer as little as possible from the dark days of midwinter. Since the dramatic changes of the nineteenth and especially the twentieth centuries (Christianization, habitation in more permanent settlement, introduction of the market economy, schooling), Inuit have adopted the general temporal framework of Western societies without abandoning their less restrictive conception of time (Bordin 2005<italic>a</italic>). Part-time contracts and seasonal jobs are numerous. While hunting game, these people lose all notion of time and practically forget sleep. The heart of the dark winter is another period of several weeks when time is “turned upside-down”; in Mittimatalik during the end-of-year festivities, hundreds of people congregate every night in the community festival hall to play and dance until the early hours. It is perhaps only during the time around the equinoxes, in other words, the periods when the alternations between day and night and between light and darkness concur, that there is any more significant correlation between sleep and the night.<sup>28</sup>

            <title>Night, a Subjective Reality</title>
            <p>Many Inuit, and not only the older ones, give little or no credit to excessive generalizations or to supposedly objective descriptions, regardless of the subject (see, e.g,. Collignon 2006). Discourse on the night is no exception, and it favors the use of “I” and “we,” for this is above all a matter of reporting personal or collective experiences that enrich the shared knowledge. When a group of Inuit talk about the night, calling on several criteria to define it, this is not under the pretext of objectivity but as a narrative basis for their own experience. Consequently, although every day is accompanied by a night, each person can only talk about his own night. It emerges as an intellectual exercise and a strongly individual experience not without repercussions on the management of time among a society that now lives, at least partly, with the constraints of the clock.</p>
            <p>Finally, we find it interesting that in Inuktitut, the term <italic>unnuijuq</italic> (from <italic>unnuaq</italic>, night) designates specifically seal hunting at their breathing holes at night. Here we observe the special role attributed to the intrusion of wakefulness—with its cynegetic, active, long-lasting, and voluntary connotations—into the heart of rest. The attribution of a “nocturnal” term to an identical and essential activity that is performed by day, seal hunting, is one of the results of the transformation produced by the position in the nychthemeral cycle.</p>

         <title>The Parisian Light: Transfiguration or Fake?</title>
         <p>We now explore the question of whether the set of actions on and by the dancers in Paris cabarets is intended to create a portion of day through the transfiguration of the night or to create a particular night. This piece of transfigured night/light—in terms of space, time, and activity—is achieved through the fabrication of “nocturnal” bodies, paradoxical in that they belong both to the day and the night, in other words, to neither one nor the other (Fourmaux 2001).<sup>29</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Canonically, cabaret shows are performed during the period outside the daytime. This time lag, which has been labeled “social asynchrony” (Lallemant 2003), is the feature most often focused on by sociologists of time and work organization, who include it among the new characteristics of work in Western societies (e.g., flexibility, job insecurity). But those who study performing arts professionals in France (Menger 1994) neglect the question of the night. With the exception of the works of Gwiazdzinski (2002, 2005), Delattre (2000), and Deleuil (1994), research into the urban world has only considered the night as a contextual variable with influence on social relations (Jarvin 1999 on juvenile festive sociability; Cauquelin 1977 on intimate interacquaintance and anonymity). Consequently, the question of the relations between the show and the social organization of sleep and wakefulness and between the show and the practices and representations of the night in the industrialized urban world remains open. Through the systematic evocation of emblematic tokens, the revue show presents itself as a compendium of stereotypes about the city. Is it also a discourse on the night?</p>
         <p>The different uses of light (shadow shows, projectors, colors) are not specific to variety shows. On the stage as in the city, they spotlight and enhance buildings and spaces; they establish a boundary (the footlights, the row of spots that light the performers) between the stage and the auditorium and between the stage and the backstage area; they mark and structure time through breaks and progressions; and they emphasize the rhythm of the music (stroboscopes). They set an emotionally expressive tone (through the use of colors). They dress the female body, which constitutes the central element of this type of show, the main thread running through this condensed night, by highlighting certain parts of it and amplifying movements.<sup>30</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Although night, nudity, and the erotic suggestiveness of the choreography may appear to be the expression of an intimate relationship particularly licensed at night, it is the contrary. It is through actions on the body that the social and cultural dimension of nocturnity appears to be produced and displayed, creating a “hyperdiurnal” nocturnal body, born from a nocturnal aesthetic of excess. These preparations take place in several stages: warming up, applying make-up, and putting on the costumes and finery.<sup>31</sup> The manager of the Crazy Horse explains: “My girls are dressed by the lighting.” Moreover, in the play of light that divides the bodies into exposed and hidden parts, the design of these different ornaments makes visible and emphasizes parts of the body that are usually hidden (breasts, buttocks) by concealing the other parts. The materials they use, feathers, sequins, lamé, and tulle, are luminous, sparkling, and light. Because of frequent absences among the dancers (for days off, but also for reasons of physical incapacity: accidents are frequent), replacements are common. As a consequence, each costume is numbered. The loss of personal name is accompanied by the use of the choreographer's name (“the Blue Bell girls”) or the name of the cabaret itself (“the girls of the Folies”). The dancers become anonymous beings, unrecognizable and all alike (“Even my boyfriend didn't recognize me the first few times he saw the show”). The creation and use of these specific bodies is therefore only conceivable, or at least practiced, within the circumscribed framework of an ephemeral repetition that is renewed every evening.</p>
         <p>The setting, this artificial niche, would appear to be a product of the Parisian night, a reproduction of it, a hyperbola, an enclave, and—a hypothesis that needs to be tested—it shows or reminds the audience that the “real” night, that which is outside, in the town, is only accessible under other conditions, for other individuals. At the same time, daylight is being reproduced, but in the form of a false image of daily life, a cruel and excessive imitation. The creation of hyperdiurnal objects torn from the surrounding night appears to have indistinctness as its objective: the young women are not identifiable by name, sight, voice, or touch. This is a paradoxical movement, contrary to the night—so much light, noise, heat, taste (because there is so much food)—yet creating the same atmosphere of nondifferentiation. In this construction, we can observe the play of opposition with the cultural markers of “good sleep” (moderation in all these aspects).<sup>32</sup> The exceeding of limits flouts the supposed specificity of the light of day, which makes everything visible and distinct; one can be dazzled by too much brightness, and the reality that therefore appears is much more indistinct than that in moonless nights.</p>

         <title>The Law: Thieves in the Night</title>
         <p>In our investigation, a variety of societies have been used as a background to elucidate the norms that frame and conduct nocturnal activities and events. The same concerns, however, are also found in the history of Western ideas, particularly in the philosophy of law; the following examples illustrate their developments since Roman times. In the Western world, the night has indeed drawn special attention on the part of the lawmakers, since it was recognized as a setting to which the rules provided for daytime did not apply.</p>
         <p>In ancient Roman law, a thief who was discovered after the act was sentenced to pay double damages. If he was caught red-handed, he lost his freedom. But if he was caught stealing in the night, he could be killed. What is the explanation for this rising scale of punishments, when the crime is the same in all three cases? What we have here is a refinement in the search for the proportionality of sentences.<sup>33</sup> In their attempts to do away with “draconian” laws, the creators of Roman law sought a more and more sophisticated scale, the highest aim of justice being to weigh merit and fault as accurately as possible and to reestablish the balance between merit and fault on the one side and reward or punishment on the other. How is this gradation of punishments from daytime theft to nocturnal theft justified? The sentence of double damages is understandable: first, the thief is obliged to return what he took, and second, he himself must pay damages to the victim for the harm caused by stealing his possessions—damages that are evaluated in a very arbitrary manner. But why should the thief in the night deserve death, even if he is unarmed and when he may have done no more than pilfer an apple from the orchard? Equally strange measures can be found in many traditional societies: the punishment is harsher when the offender is caught red-handed than when he is caught afterward (Diamond 1971:78). From this to being permitted to kill the night thief caught in the act there is just one step, a step that has doubtless been taken many times. These curiosities are generally explained in terms of psychological considerations: the thirst for vengeance of the victim or his family is blunted by the passage of time. Being caught red-handed, especially at night, exposes the thief to the victim's first impetuous feelings of anger. Apparently, therefore, it was the voice of the wronged party that dictated the provisions of ancient law (von Jhering 1880). There is a good deal of truth in these explanations, but we believe they overlook the essential dimension that gives what we might call the “nocturnal economy” all its specificity.</p>
         <p>There is no economy without a definition of property rights, which may be individual, domestic, tribal, or collective. Whether or not one can carry out a trade in things is secondary. One must first know whether these things belong to someone or to nobody (<italic>res nullius</italic> in Roman law) and, in the former case, who the owner is. Now the definition of property rights, far from being free, is itself costly, although this cost is generally hidden. The night brings this cost to light, if we can put it that way. From an economic point of view, the property right that applies to an asset of whatever kind is the capacity of the holder of this right to consume the services, the revenue, produced by this asset (e.g., the rent from a building) directly, or to consume them indirectly, by means of exchange. As an asset has several qualities, the property right applies to all of them, provided that they can be defined. This delimitation entails costs of description, measurement, and supervision: “enclosure costs,” one might call them, by analogy to a farmer enclosing his fields. These costs must be weighed against the advantages drawn from the operation of defining the property right. For an object of little value, few resources will be spent on its protection.</p>
         <p>In practice, as the perfect definition has a prohibitive cost, property rights are never perfectly delimited. The same is true for transactions. Because not all the qualities of a good can be measured economically, a transaction does not involve all its qualities, but only certain among them, especially those that can easily be measured. Kant expressed this idea well. To the question of how far the right of taking possession of the soil extends (although land is not the hardest thing to delimit), the philosopher replied, “So far as the ability to have it under one's power extends; that is, as far as he who wishes to appropriate it can defend it.” It is as if the soil were to say, “If you cannot protect me, neither can you defend me” (Kant 1993:141). This naturally leads us to raise another question: What would the soil say if it could speak at night? On this basis, it is true that the definition of property rights is more difficult and therefore more expensive at night and that there are goods that are not worth enough to be protected in the darkness—and for the purposes of discouraging thieves, sentences will be more severe for those who act at night. Not only do we have to spend more money to protect our goods because of the night, but we must also implement stricter sentences, which, if expressed in longer prison terms, increase still further the expenditure imposed on us by the night.</p>
         <p>Another particular element that needs to be considered is the cost of proof. This brings into play what we might call the presumption of ownership, which figures among the prolegomena to the presumption of innocence and is founded on the same reasoning. “I must return something that I have received from someone, because I presume that he is the genuine owner, and it is only in the event that I do not wish to give him back this object that I, myself, must prove the contrary.” This presumption is based not on moral principles but on purely practical considerations (just like the presumption of innocence). If each time I use an object belonging to me, anyone could challenge my right of ownership over that object, obliging me to demonstrate urbi et orbi that the object is indeed mine, then all activity would become impossible, whence the saying “possession is nine-tenths of the law” and all the regulations governing immovable goods. But at dusk, when the day is drawing to a close, the presumption of ownership is much less obvious, and the same is true for the presumption of innocence. In the case of theft, it is up to the victim to prove that the thief is a thief. The burden of proof lies with the person who has been robbed because the thief is presumed to be the owner of the object stolen, which amounts to saying that he is presumed innocent. But the burden of proof is necessarily costly. This clarifies the logic underlying the principle of in flagrante delicto. In this case, the burden of proof is reduced to zero, and one can apply without any qualms the most severe sentence of capital punishment. In a context of high costs of information, and therefore of proof, the more time goes by, the harder it is to find the proof. Reducing the severity of the sentence as time passes is a means of reducing, on average, the price paid by an innocent person in the event of an error of justice (Posner 1981:201). As for the night thief, if he is not arrested on the spot, the cost of proof quickly rises to such a prohibitive level that we very often resign ourselves to the idea of leaving him at large. He who is caught in the act pays with his life for those who get away scot-free.</p>
         <p>We could thus introduce an economics of the night that would start by listing not only the additional costs imposed by the disappearance of the sun every 24 hours but also the activities devoted to reducing these costs and the technological advances they continually generate. At the same time, we could shed light on the behavior of those who live by night, not only night thieves and other criminals, but also police officers on the night beat and manufacturers of house lights, street lights, alarms, night vision equipment, etc. This expenditure could be compared with what the night contributes: the darkness that facilitates our rest and that we have no need to produce; the reduction in activity that it imposes every day; other people becoming, as if by miracle, quiet—a spontaneous norm that one cannot transgress without being considered antisocial. Finally, this would lead us to study the economic necessity of restorative sleep and to see whether this represents a human invariant through the ages—sleep during which our vigilance necessarily slackens, with potentially dangerous consequences for us: even the most powerful of tyrants is obliged to share his power, if only with the person who guards his bedroom, the aptly named “bodyguard” who has the life of his lord in his hands and, at night, may dispose of it at his will.</p>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Our roundabout trip has strengthened a strong cultural component in the domain of the perception, understanding, activities, and representations of the nocturnal segment of the nychthemeron. The night contains all sorts of figures and movements that remain inexplicable when considered only from a daytime perspective.</p>
         <p>There remain two points that have not been covered in detail: the transition between the day and the night and the phenomenon of interference, deliberate or involuntary, of the night in the day or the day in the night.<sup>34</sup> Regarding the first point, it should be borne in mind that each society negotiates the twilight transitions to construct the thresholds enabling them to enter and exit what may seem to us to be obvious: “night” on the one hand and “day” on the other. Consequently, specific cultural constraints are imposed the world over to monitor the elasticity or porosity of these space-times, according to “a metaphysics of frontiers.” These include, in particular, the rituals involving the body and its rhythms (dance, song, trance) and the use of substances to delay the onset of sleep (psychoactive drugs), for reasons arising out of collective obligations (work, ritual activity, war, etc.) or individual constraints (creation, sexual relations, etc.). Then again, drugs also can be used to bring sleep.</p>
         <p>The varied interventions performed on this period of transition range from learning to stay awake and injunctions imposed on children to acts of a persecutory or military nature such as sleep deprivation as a means of torture and everything that comes within the domain of individual violence or that brings the night into play as one of the parameters of political action. Many societies invent the means—gestural, acoustic, pharmacological—to defer sleep during rituals. Among the Inuit, in spring/summer, it is common practice to go without sleep for up to 48 hours, while hunting game or because of circumstances that favor the continuation of activities; sleep may then be regarded as an obstacle (Bordin 2005<italic>a</italic>). The Indians of the Upper Xingu, who sing and dance all night long during the dry season, use techniques for resisting sleep such as the nocturnal narration of myths, the performing of songs and series of calls and shouts, and the use of tobacco (Basso 1985; Monod Becquelin 1975).</p>
         <p>The second point, on which we hardly touched, concerns the “intrusions” of the day into the night and vice versa. One example of this hold of the night over the day is provided by cultures in which the narration of dreams is obligatory and has serious repercussions on the events of the day. It is worth noting that among the Inuit, certain elders explain the gravity of the current social situation, especially the high suicide rate among young people, partly by the disappearance of the custom of sharing dreams (Bordin 2009; Laugrand 2001). Among the Tzotzil Maya, where “The dream is the measure of man,” and a man who does not dream is mad or stupid, Laughlin (1966) relates the consequences, in the form of several days, if not weeks, of collective work by the community, imposed by the interpretation of a little boy's dream. Here, manifestly, the day is the child of the night, and the collective tasks are the effects of an individual dream.</p>
         <p>Mothré (2006) shows, in the Maya Highlands, that demons, despite being canonical markers of the night, can also appear in the daytime. This signifies that the sun does not provide homogeneous protection in terms of either the duration of its presence in the sky or the extent of the territory on which it shines. How can the sun be physically present in the sky and yet absent from its protective function, and how can the nocturnal exist in broad daylight? If the case of the dark or “lost” days of the period of the year's renewal, often coinciding with the carnival, are well documented as an invasion of the forces of the night—of the “old times”—in the year, little analysis has been made of intromissions of night defined as the days “without name” or “which don't exist” (Bricker 1986; Guiteras-Holmes 1965; Villa Rojas 1968) into the day. Midnight and midday, although opposed, are both marked by the same danger. Midday for humans coincides with midnight for the <italic>pukuj</italic>: when the sun reaches its zenith, it traces a vertical axis that cuts through the horizontal layers of the universe and brings them into contact with each other.<sup>35</sup> So we are dealing with a double movement: the “diurnization” of the night and the “nocturnalization” of certain activities. To occupy the space-time of the night, certain rules must be applied, such as increasing the amount of lighting, intensifying activity, or singing to fill the dark sky with sounds and noises that do not copy the day but instead produce a different image of it, often overemphasizing its characteristics.</p>
         <p>In brief, this cross-disciplinary investigation has led us to reverse some of our presuppositions and to reconsider ethnographic materials from diverse perspectives. The object “night” was set down, right from the start, as one of the two great spatiotemporal frameworks of individual and social life, whatever the society under examination: there remains the paradox that the construction of the object is still more a question of emic than etic, of the observed and not of the observer. All the findings show the importance of cosmologic speculations, norms of action, and ethical concerns and of all those psychic defenses that demonstrate that, all over the planet, the night is indeed a legitimate object of investigation except in the anthropologists' community. This may be because the “anthropology of the night” can only be a multi- and cross-disciplinary study, which makes it all the more difficult to invent alternative methodologies. We have attempted simply to present a few lines of thought on the subject, while being quite aware of the limitations of our endeavor. To elaborate such methodologies, we need to take two constraints into account: we lack the field materials for developing a well-reasoned comparison, both in the laboratory and on the site, but at the same time, we also lack the general concepts, the tools, that could be ranked alongside those that constitute the key areas of anthropological analysis, such as “corporate groups,” “referential practice,” or “agency.” That is why we think it necessary to create new concepts, such as that of nocturnity, to designate, as a first step, spatiotemporal, physical, and psychic states proceeding from what each culture defines as “the night.” We are therefore obliged to proceed on both levels simultaneously: accumulation of data on one side, creation of concepts on the other. Generally speaking, postmodern societies appear to be silent on the subject of their cosmology, leading some observers to the hasty conclusion that they have been swept away by acculturation and globalization. We assume that nocturnal representations open the way to a “black box” that speaks of danger, sacrifice, exchange of substance, and rupture but also union and recomposition. Within the mute core of a ritual we will rediscover the origin of a fundamental dynamic: to bring about the birth and death of the day, the birth and death of the night. Finally, the cross-disciplinary perspective guiding our research into the night has brought to light the various constraints, on individual and collective levels, with which human societies are confronted and how they deal with them: in particular, specific organization of space, enabling the body, during sleep, to be placed in a stable, protected environment or, on the contrary, to be prepared for activities that cannot be performed during the diurnal segment of the nychthemeron. We have not sought to infer a mechanical order of causalities between the adjustment of biological rhythms and the cultural configuration of nocturnal time, either for phases of rest or for professional and ritualized activities. This would take us far beyond the scope of our investigation. Our primary goal has been to highlight the difficulties inherent in studying the object “night,” so that we may at last tackle “the other half of the world.”</p>
