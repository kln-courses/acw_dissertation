<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN STACHEL* THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS** One thing that everyone can agree on is that the subject of geometro- dynamics, whatever we interpret it as covering, is inseparably associated with the name of John Wheeler. To discuss the history and current status of geometrodynamics thus necessitates the discussion of the evolution of Wheeler's ideas on the subject. This is not meant to detract, in any way, from the fact that he has been ably assisted in his intellectual Odys- sey by a distinguished group of co-workers; most prominently by Charles Misner, whom we have been fortunate to hear today on the subject. Since Professor Wheeler has recently indicated his abandonment of major features of the original geometrodynamic program, as I shall dis- cuss later, I hope he will forgive me the rather dramatic title I have chosen for my talk. Geometrodynamics represents an attempt to develop a fundamental physical theory; an attempt which directs our attention to a number of the most important questions raised by the development of theoretical physics in this century, as well as presenting in new guise some of the perennial issues associated with the evolution of mathematics and phys- ics. These issues are of direct interest to philosophers of science, and I shall try to discuss geometrodynamics primarily with an eye to its pos- sible bearing on some of these issues (and vice versa), rather than with the attention to technical detail more appropriately reserved for an audi- ence primarily composed of physicists. This will no doubt lead me to present oversimplified, if not caricatured, versions of certain problems the geometrodynamicists have considered; I apologize in advance for this. Geometrodynamics arose from the study of classical field theories, more particularly from Maxwell's electrodynamics, which first brought the field concept into prominence in physics; and especially from Ein- stein's general theory of relativity, which extended the field concept to gravitation, the other fundamental interaction known to classical phys- ics.

Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht-Holland</page><page sequence="2">32 JOHN STACHEL compatible with the requirements of special relativity led to efforts to develop a special-relativistic field theory of gravitation, modelled on electrodynamics, which had been found to be a relativistically invariant theory. The peculiarities of the gravitational interaction, notably the equivalence principle, showed that an adequate special-relativistic gravi- tational theory was not possible, except locally in the neighborhood of a point of space-time; rather, the fixed metrical line element of special relativity, the Minkowski metric, had to be generalized to a variable Riemannian metric, which now played the role of gravitational poten- tials as well as spatio-temporal metric; and obeyed field equations that generalized Poisson's equation for the Newtonian gravitational poten- tial. Thus, for the first time in the history of physics, an element of the geometrical part of the specification of the total physical situation with- in a physical theory was not given a priori, but was subjected to certain dynamical laws. Earlier speculations, notably by Riemann and Clifford, after the discovery of non-Euclidean and particularly Riemannian ge- ometries, about a possible dynamic role for three-geometry only bore fruit after being united by Einstein with the four-dimensional geometric viewpoint that Minkowski introduced into the understanding of special relativity. The dynamically variable metric of space-time was used to explain the nature of gravitation, which was thus no longer to be looked upon as a 'force', but rather as an aspect of the geometrical structure of space-time. Loosely speaking, for the moment, we may say that gravita- tion had been geometrized. Einstein himself was not content with his creation of general relativity. He never believed that the general theory was any more than a way station in his search for a unified field theory, which would somehow enable the explanation of all the forces of nature in terms of the proper- ties of a single field structure on the space-time manifold - however com- plex that structure might prove to be. At the time Einstein started on his search for such a theory, the only known forces of nature were the electromagnetic and gravitational; and it seemed quite possible to him that a suitable unified theory of both might also explain the various quan- tum effects then being so rapidly discovered, and which he himself did so much to explore. The development of quantum mechanics, and the discovery of various intrinsically non-classical aspects of the microworld as its study progressed, never induced Einstein to give up the search for</page><page sequence="3">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 33 such an all-embracing field theory, which was also to explain the quan- tum riddle. Whether one should characterize Einstein's vision as a geo- metrization of physics, or a physicalization of geometry, is partly a matter of outlook, of course la. But the point to be emphasized is his faith in the search for a field model as the way towards fundamental progress in physics. Wheeler's approach to geometrodynamics, as he named his outlook, was based on an acceptance of much of Einstein's viewpoint at the clas- sical level. But from the beginning, this was coupled with an abandon- ment of all resistance to the acceptance of the quantum mechanics as something equally fundamental. Thus, from the outset of Wheeler's work in this field, there was a clear distinction made between classical geometrodynamics, which was to explain the classical aspects of the physical world; and quantum geometrodynamics, which was to result from the application of the quantum principle (i.e., the principles of some standard quantization technique) to the classical theory. Quantum geometrodynamics was hopefully to lead to an explanation of the pecu- liarities of the microworld, and in particular the existence and nature of the elementary particles. I said above that Wheeler accepted Einstein's viewpoint at the classical level. That is not really accurate. In the first place, as the very name 'geometrodynamics' implies, Wheeler has tended from the beginning of his work to place more em- phasis on the interpretation of Einstein's equations as governing the dynamical evolution of the three-dimensional geometry from surface to surface on a family of spacelike hypersurfaces into which spacetime is arbitrarily broken up. As he has faced the problems of quantization of general relativity, this emphasis on what has been called the 'three-plus- one' breakup of the field equations has deepened. We shall return later to the question of whether a vital element of Einstein's viewpoint may be lost in such a breakup. But now I shall discuss another aspect in which Wheeler's outlook differed from Einstein's. Indeed, Wheeler went rather further in his acceptance of general rela- tivity than Einstein was prepared to go. Einstein, as mentioned above, never regarded general relativity as more than a provisional attempt to apply the field point of view consistently to one field, the gravitational, the peculiarities of which enabled it to be treated successfully by showing</page><page sequence="4">34 JOHN STACHEL that it could be assimilated to the metrical structure of space-time, and in that sense was not a force field similar to others. The universal law of physical space must now be a generalization of the law just character- ized [i.e., "'field free' space in the special theory of relativivity."]. I now assume that there are two steps of generalization: (a) pure gravitational field (b) general field (in which quantities corresponding somehow to the electromagnetic field occur, too).lb It seemed hopeless to me at that time [i.e., the period between the development of special and of general relativity] to venture the attempt of representing the total field (b) and to ascertain field-laws for it. I preferred, therefore to set up a preliminary formal frame for the representation of the entire physical reality .... Not for a moment, of course, did I doubt that this formulation was merely a makeshift in order to give the general principle of relativity a preliminary closed expression. For it was essentially not anything more than a theory of the gravitational field, which was somehow artificially isolated from the total field of as yet unknown structure.2 He provisionally lumped all non-gravitational sources of the gravita- tional field into the stress-energy tensor, which is introduced phenom- enologically as an external source term ('right-hand side') into the field equations for gravitation (since the gravitational field equations are non- linear, the gravitational field may be said to act as its own source as well). His main aim in formulating a unified field theory was somehow to do away with this phenomenological source term in the field equations, which to him expressed our ignorance of the deeper nature of the non- gravitational interrelationships of nature. The right-hand side is a formal condensation of all things whose comprehension in the sense of field theory is still problematic.3 What sorts of things get lumped into that source term, the stress energy tensor T'j? Aside from the stress-energy tensor of Maxwell's electro- magnetic field, which at least was in field form, there was the stress- energy tensor for 'matter', in the sense in which physicists usually use the word: ordinary solid, liquid or gaseous matter. This may be described theoretically either as a continuum, with the aid of such concepts as pressures, mass densities, etc.; or as an assembly of particles, described by such concepts as masses, velocities, etc. Of course, today we regard all such matter as composed of particles - molecules, atoms, or what have you (it is of little importance what we call them if we confine our- selves to the classical level). Even if we treat it as a continuum, we regard</page><page sequence="5">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 35 the continuum properties as ultimately derivable from some sort of sta- tistical averaging over an ensemble of particles. Thus, when the physicist speaks of matter as opposed to fields, he usually means what (at least some) philosophers might think it wiser to describe as matter in its par- ticulate forms, as opposed to matter in its field form - even if the former is treated by continuum concepts. To adopt a purely or exclusively field point of view is to regard all particulate aspects of matter (in the philosophic usage of the term) as arising at some higher level as manifestations of more basic fields. Con- versely, a purely or exclusively particle point of view would have to show how fields, or seeming field-like effects arise from more basic interactions of particles. A dualistic point of view, of course, would accept both par- ticulate and field aspects of matter as ontologically similar in status. This was the standpoint adopted by Lorentz, for example, in his inter- pretation of Maxwell theory. The Maxwell field is regarded as being produced by certain sources, regions where the empty-space Maxwell equations break down and must be supplemented by (particulate) source terms describable by certain mechanical and electrical properties (masses, charges, etc.). The particles (Lorentz's 'electrons') in turn obey equations of motion which depend on the forces exerted on them by the field (Lorentz forces). If the particles are regarded as truly dimensionless points, the empty space-equations are valid right up to the points where the particles are located. The presence of the particle manifests itself as a singularity of the field; the motion of this field singularity is not deter- mined by the field equations alone, but must be additionally postulated. Einstein was a believer in the pure field concept, as noted above. From his viewpoint, the success of general relativity had shown that the ulti- mate unified field would have a metrical aspect or limit, defined over the manifold of space-time events, which could be identified with the gravi- tational field. No really successful unification of gravitation with any other field had been accomplished, as Einstein recognized; but the search for such a theory was based upon looking for some extension of the field concept going beyond but somehow embracing the purely metrical as- pect of general relativity, since gravitation seems to be a universal inter- action. One criterion which a successful pure field theory would have to obey would be that of having its field equations hold at all points of the manifold of variables over which the basic field was defined; this mani-</page><page sequence="6">36 JOHN STACHEL fold would have to include at least the space-time manifold, if general relativity were indeed a valid basis for future generalization. This crite- rion implies that any solutions to the basic field equations with singular- ities must be rejected, as they would involve places (the points of the manifold where the singularities occurred) at which the field equations break down and must be supplemented by some additional information (cf. the discussion of Lorentz's approach to electrodynamics above). For an incomplete or phenomenological theory this would be all right, of course, as a matter of practical application of the theory, as in the various standard applications of Maxwell theory or general relativity. But for a fundamental unified field theory it would be a disaster, if no non-singular solutions of the basic equations with appropriate physical interpretations were to exist. Speaking of the derivation of the equations of motion of gravitational sources in general relativity in which they are treated as singularities in the field, Einstein says: Now it would of course be possible to object: If singularities are permitted at the positions of the material points what justification is there for forbidding the occurrence of singular- ities in the rest of space? This objection would be justified if the equations of gravitation were to be considered as equations of the total field. [Since this is not the case], however, one will have to say that the field of a material particle may the less be viewed as a pure gravitational field the closer one comes to the position of the particle. If one had the field- equation of the total field, one would be compelled to demand that the particles themselves would everywhere be describable as singularity-free solutions of the completed field equations. Only then would the general theory of relativity be a complete theory.' Maxwell's theory of the electric field remained a torso, because it was unable to set up laws for the behavior of electric density, without which there can, of course, be no such thing as an electro-magnetic field. Analogously the general theory of relativity furnished then a field-theory of gravitation, but no theory of the field-creating masses. (These remarks pre- suppose it as self-evident that a field-theory may not contain any singularities, i.e., any positions or parts in space in which the field laws are not valid.)5 Wheeler suggested that general relativity itself might present us with such a unified field theory; which, if not complete, in the sense that it explained all aspects of the physical world, at least would provide a model for some classical aspects of the world which it could explain in a closed, adequate fashion. He treated both the pure gravitational case, and the coupled gravitational electromagnetic system (Einstein-Maxwell theory). He and others have tried to use similar methods to treat various non-classical fields, usually associated, in their quantized forms, with</page><page sequence="7">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 37 elementary particles as coupled to the gravitational field. But what sig- nificance is to be attached to a classical theory of fields, such as spinor fields for the neutrino, which seem not to have a classical limit as fields, is rather obscure; we shall return later to this problem. Classical geo- metrodynamics, at any rate, would seem to stand or fall on the success of its treatment of the electromagnetic and gravitational fields. Two possible ways were put forward by Wheeler by which general relativity might itself be regarded as a unified field theory: geons and topology. (1) The self coupling of the gravitational field manifested in the non- linearity of the Einstein field equations permits construction of non- singular (approximate) solutions to the (sourceless) equations which rep- resent concentrations of the gravitational field in limited spatial regions; far away from these regions of concentration, they appear to behave as if they possessed mass in the same sense as ordinary (phenomenological) sources of the gravitational field. Thus we have what Wheeler referred to as 'mass without mass'. But these configurations are not stable; they do not last indefinitely, but tend to dissipate with time. In addition, while classical general relativity permits such solutions on any scale of size. due to the absence of an inherent unit of length in pure gravitation theory, consideration of the limitations on the applicability of the classical treat- ment posed by a quantum treatment shows that a classical approach is valid only when the geons have such huge masses as to be of no use as models of even ordinary astrophysical objects, let alone elementary par- ticles. Since concentrations of electromagnetic field energy show mass but not charge properties, if one uses the coupled Einstein-Maxwell equations as the basis for building up such geons, they are still un- charged. Thus, charge could not be explained in this way. (2) Probably inspired by some speculations of Weyl, and the work by Einstein and Rosen on the 'bridge' interpretation of the Schwarzschild metric, Wheeler suggested a second way in which general relativity might be interpreted as an already unified field theory. The phenomenological source regions, or singularities of the field, needed as sources of electro- magnetic and gravitational fields in the usual treatments, might be elimi- nated by giving up the Euclidean topology usually assumed for the space- time manifold in the large. Since the fundamental equations of Einstein- Maxwell theory are partial differential equations, they only require Eu-</page><page sequence="8">38 JOHN STACHEL clidean topology in the small, i.e., in the neighborhood of each point of the space-time manifold. They are quite compatible with manifolds which globally have a topology which would appear quite strange from the traditional point of view, which took the global topological structure as something fixed and unproblematical. The question of whether any manifolds are compatible with physically interesting singularity-free solutions to the field equations; and more generally, what are the pos- sible topological extensions of a given small 'patch' of a solution to the field equations thus came to the fore. The emphasis Wheeler's work directed to such questions was undoubtedly one of the major stimuli to the recent rapid development of the long-neglected area of global space- time structure.6 The possibility of having 'charge without charge', as well as 'mass without mass', in the topological sense thus arose. There would be no place on the complete solution manifold where the field equations broke down; apparent regions of mass or charge concentration, when looked at more closely, would be seen to be merely regions where multiply- connected handles, or bridges to other sheets, of the space-time mani- fold were present. But here the singularity problem came back to haunt geometrodynamics. While one could find initial three-dimensional space- like hypersurfaces of space-time on which such a non-singular 'worm- hole' or bridge topology solution could be imposed, in the case of the Schwarzschild solution for example; the evolution of this metric in ac- cord with Einstein's equations (or 'geometrodynamics' in Wheeler's de- scriptive phrase for such evolution of three-space geometries in time) led inevitably to the development of a singularity in the metric - i.e., to a breakdown in the field equations, incompatible with the geometrody- namic view of the field as everything. Indeed, such singularities came to be viewed by Wheeler as the symp- toms of a major crisis in theoretical physics, as they showed up in more and more places in general relativity. It had been known for a long time that spherically symmetric closed models of the universe, or collapsing spherically symmetric dust clouds developed intrinsic singularities which could indeed be reached in a finite proper time by someone falling in- ward with the collapse. But it had been hoped that this was an accidental feature of the highly unrealistic abstraction of a perfectly spherically symmetric collapse, which would disappear in somewhat more complex</page><page sequence="9">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 39 models of collapsing universes or stars. The exact opposite has been shown to be the case. Under a very wide class of seemingly reasonable and harmless assumptions, the inevitable development of a singularity from an initially non-singular situation has been demonstrated by Hawk- ing, Penrose et al. in a remarkable series of 'singularity theorems'.6 The exact nature of the singularity is not yet fully analysed in all cases; but it is certainly connected with a breakdown in the applicability of the field equations in such regions. Wheeler speaks of 'the paradox of gravitational collapse'. Why paradox? Because Einstein's equation says 'this is the end' and physics says 'there is no end!'... Great as was the crisis of 1911 [when classical electrodynamics predicted the 'collapse' of the Rutherford atom, while the atom was known to be quite stable], today gravitational collapse confronts physics with its greatest crisis ever. At issue is the fate, not of matter alone, but of the universe itself.... Collapse, moreover, is not unique to the large- scale dynamics of the universe. A white dwarf star or a neutron star of more than critical mass is predicted to undergo gravitational collapse to a black hole.... For collapse to a black hole, the observer has his choice whether (1) to observe from a safe distance ... or (2) to follow the falling matter on in, in which case he sees the final stages of the collapse, not only of the matter itself, but of the geometry surrounding the matter, to indefinitely high compaction, but only at the cost of his own early demise.7 Consideration of such problems no doubt initially reinforced Wheeler's belief that only quantization of general relativity could provide a way forward for geometrodynamics. But there are a number of conceptual difficulties in such a program, even if we leave aside all the formidable technical problems which so far (and may indeed forever) prevent any- one from carrying out even a fully successful formal quantization of the exact non-linear theory. (1) Such a theory would presumably involve the three fundamental constants h, Planck's constant, G, Newton's gravitational constant, and c, the velocity of light. As Planck himself realized at the turn of the cen- tury, natural units of length, mass and time can be formed from these constants; these units should presumably play some important role in the resulting quantum theory of gravitation, yet they are not such as to be easily associated with any elementary particles or their properties. If a particle is of geometrodynamical origin, it is not a 'wormhole' in the geometry of space (10-33 cm) for its extension is enormous by comparison (10-13 cm). Moreover, its energy (10-27 g to 10-24 g) is negligible by comparison with the energy associated with a single 'wormhole' (the Planck mass-energy, (hc3/G)1/2 = 2.2 x 10-5 .g).... No possibility has ever presented itself for a quantum geometrodynamic interpretation of a particle but this: the</page><page sequence="10">40 JOHN STACHEL particle is not any individual 10- 33-cm fluctuation in the geometry of space; instead, it is a fantastically weak alteration in the pattern of these fluctuations....8 (2) Quantum geometrodynamics envisions the quantization of the space- time structure of the entire universe. This requires a new interpretation of the quantum mechanical formalism, totally at variance with the usual ones and most unpalatable to most physicists. This is the Everett many- universe or relative state interpretation, as developed by Wheeler and DeWitt notably. The usual interpretation, as developed by Bohr, re- quires a conceptual distinction between the microsystem under con- sideration, and the classically describable macroscopic setting with which it interacts. Quantum probability amplitudes allow us to derive the transition probability for a microsystem making a transition between a macroscopic preparation and registration as the result of some clas- sically describable interaction that it undergoes between its preparation and registration. Thus, quantum mechanics as usually interpreted, can only treat open microsystems, in interaction with classically describable apparatuses that allow intervention into the system in the form of prepa- ration of the microsystem and registration of the final result, both in- volving some irreversible change in the macro-apparatus. But quan- tizing the entire universe would clearly leave nothing on the outside, so that one is faced with the problem of giving an interpretation of the quantum formalism for a closed system. Wheeler was well aware of this problem, and that it forced a new interpretation of quantum mechanics on the quantum geometrodynamicist: To ask about the 'quantum state of the closed universe' is to displace the 'observer' from his usual position outside the system under study. He is inside. No one has found a way to deal rationally with this kind of situation except through Everett's 'relative state formula- tion' of quantum mechanics. It abandons the postulate that an observation starts the system off in a fresh quantum state. Instead, it envisages the wave function after an 'observation' as the sum of terms ('branches of history'), each the product of (i) a factor describing the nonobserver part of the system in one quantum state, and (ii) a factor describing the ob- server in a corresponding 'relative state.' All branches of the history are viewed as 'co- existing' in an ethereal sense, and only in an ethereal sense, a sense perhaps best described by William James. "Actualities," he wrote, "seem to float in a wider sea of possibilities from out of which they were chosen; and somewhere, indeterminism says, such possibilities exist, and form part of the truth."9 Hence the name 'many universe interpretation'. This interpretation is based upon the von Neumann approach to quantum mechanics, which (as opposed to Bohr's approach) attempts to treat the wave function as</page><page sequence="11">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 41 a property of the quantum mechanical system per se; and then to under- stand the preparation-interaction-registration cycle as the result of an interaction between the wave function of the system and a wave func- tion for the measuring apparatus, also treated as a quantum system. This leads straight to the famous 'measurement problem', the collapse of the wave packet, the consciousness of the observer as the ultimate col- lapser of wave packets, etc. This approach is not very attractive to me; it seems to be based upon an attempt to grasp the new features of whole- ness in interactions manifested by microsystems, which Bohr tried so forcefully to point out (quite apart from what one may think of the philosophical position he developed to understand it), on the basis of a return to the old metaphysics characterizing the classical type of expla- nation of interaction. This involved a distinction between the two sys- tems in interaction, each with its own properties, and the interaction between them. Unfortunately, many interesting and important physical problems, such as the quantum mechanics of systems with infinitely many degrees of freedom and how they may exhibit irreversible behavior - problems which indeed may lead to important advances in our under- standing of quantum theory - are currently often discussed in the con- text (may I call it a metaphysical one?) of the 'quantum theory of mea- surement' which obscures their significance. Be that as it may. What Everett, Wheeler and DeWitt propose to do is to accept the system, the apparatus ('observer'), the wave functions in Hilbert space, but get rid of the collapse of the wave function. Every time a measurement forces a system to make a choice, it makes all choices, so that indeed everything that can happen does happen. They demonstrate that for an observer moving through this constantly branch- ing universe (or, if you like, into one of the many universes) everything will seem to happen just as if only his branch (or universe) existed (at least, if we start off with a single unbranched wave function). The ad- vantage claimed for this interpretation is that we can now interpret the wave function realistically as representing unconditioned probabilities for branchings, so that no problem of interpreting the wave function arises. The most complete exposition of this viewpoint has been given by DeWitt (see, for example, his Varenna lectures,'0 from which the fol- lowing quotations are taken), so we shall base some comments on his</page><page sequence="12">42 JOHN STACHEL exposition. He presents the Everett, Wheeler, DeWitt approach as a return to 'naive realism'; for this approach "the symbols of quantum mechanics represent reality just as much as do those of classical mechan- ics." This is opposed to the conventional interpretations, in which we are given "a kind of ghostly world whose mathematical symbols repre- sent potentialities rather than reality." 10 It thus seems that Wheeler and DeWitt do not see eye to eye on the advantages of having 'potentialities' or 'possibilities' represented in a theory; nor is it clear what the view- point of 'naive realism' is on 'coexistence in the ethereal sense'. Indeed, another sort of 'naive realist' might want more details about the 'reality' of the Hilbert space in which our state vector is waving about - especially if, being the state vector of the universe, it is the only inhabitant of this whole space. But humor aside, the 'real' problems of this approach seem to me to be anterior to such questions. We are supposed to know ab initio what is a system and what is an apparatus, or observer. "Postulate of complexity. The world is decomposable into systems and apparata;"11 and which vector may be interpreted as describing a system and an ap- paratus is an uncorrelated state ("I shall simply assume that such a state can be produced upon demand" 12) in which they are to interact in the way called measurement in von Neumann's interpretation. Also, as usual, the wave function, which before the measurement interaction was a product of a system and an apparatus wave function, is afterwards as- sumed to take a form which can be written as a linear superposition of products of system and apparatus wave functions for each possible re- sult of the measurement. We are to accept that the universe splits in some sense ('ethereal' or not) in such a way that there is a universe (or branch) in which each of these terms occurs alone, with the appropriate proba- bility derived for each branch. That is, the universe splits upon each measurement interaction, but 'we' remain aware of only one branch (or universe) since each of 'us' splits similarly. Thus, Schroedinger's cat is alive in one universe and dead in another. What could be simpler, both for the cat and for Schroedinger, who is presumably still alive on some branch and pleased as punch now that it has all been explained to him? Of course, on another branch he may be alive and have convinced De Witt this is all rubbish, but (perhaps fortunately) 'we' do not live on either of these branches. The trouble is, of course, that given any wave function there is an</page><page sequence="13">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 43 infinity of different and inequivalent ways of splitting it into linear super- positions of other wave functions. It is assumed in this interpretation right from the beginning that we are, or rather the wave function is, supposed to know which splitting it should actually make to correspond to a measurement. Unfortunately, objects don't seem to come into the world bearing little labels: system or apparatus. Even if they did, initially, we could well imagine situations where a bit of system rubbed off onto a piece of apparatus, so that they got quite mixed up after a while. So this approach seems to beg the question - the concept of the distinction between microsystem and macroscopic background is really assumed to start with. Even given this distinction, it is hard to see why we should never see linear superpositions of macroscopic states of the same clas- sical macroscopic object, since such non-classical states of classical sys- tems are quite compatible with the quantum formalism. Another problem arises if we assume that the superposition principle continues to hold as we look back in time: we would see our branch (or universe) wave function splitting off from a (potentially infinite) branching process back and back through each past measurement inter- action. If we only knew our branch wave function at this time, say, this would not be enough to reconstruct the history even of our branch, since the splittings will depend on the previously unsplit wave functions, which are presumed to be unknown to us. If we are thus not to arrive at an infinite regress in which nothing is even in principle determined for any branch (not even probabilities), we thus seem forced to adopt the concept of an initial wave function for the universe. In addition to the possible embarrassment of having to specify what was a system and what an apparatus at the time of the first measurement in those hoary days of yore, one may feel somewhat embarrassed at getting tied down to a particular cosmological model as well as to an indefinite number of universes in order to explain the quantal features of one corner of our (single) universe at this time. Perhaps I have said enough to indicate why I do not find this an attractive ploy for giving an interpretation to the wave function in quantum geometrodynamics. Yet some interpretation is needed. (3) Leaving aside the question of the interpretation of the wave func- tion in quantized general relativity, we are still left with the question, function of what? On what variables shall the wave function depend?</page><page sequence="14">44 JOHN STACHEL Wheeler's answer to this question (not shared by all who concern them- selves with quantization of general relativity, I hasten to add) is that the wave function should be a functional of spacelike three-geometries, giving somehow a probability for the measurement of a particular three- geometry throughout all space on some space-like hypersurface. Thus, the space over which the wave function of geometrodynamics is defined is the space of all spacelike three-geometries, which Wheeler calls super- space. Now Wheeler has good formal motivation for this choice, into which I do not wish to enter here, as it would involve us in quite a bit of technical detail. However, I should like to emphasize that the price that is paid for these formal advantages is great. Indeed, by thus focussing at- tention on the geometry of three-dimensional spacelike hypersurfaces in general relativity, their evolution in time classically, (which gave us the word 'geometrodynamics'), and the probability of their occurrence in quantum geometrodynamics, we seem to be relinquishing what had al- ways been thought to be perhaps the greatest achievement of the Ein- stein-Minkowski point of view: the singling out of four-dimensional space-time as the fundamental arena of physics. From this latter point of view, the slicing up of a space-time into a family of spacelike hyper- surfaces seems somewhat artificial - not wrong, surely, merely rather arbitrary, since one slicing seems as good as another. It also focusses at- tention on a feature which at least some general relativistic space-times share with non-relativistic space-times: the existence of global Cauchy surfaces. These are spacelike surfaces on which data may be given suffi- cient to determine the past and future evolution of a field throughout the whole space-time. Now, while certain space-times have such global Cauchy surfaces, it is by no means a necessary requirement that must be imposed upon a space-time in general relativity. Even more disturbing is the fact that this whole approach seems to by- pass the most characteristic structure of a space-time in relativity, the causal structure associated with its null cones. These are intrinsically de- fined structures within the theory, which give rise to the characteristic separation of the neighborhood of each point of space-time into a future, a past, and an elsewhere. One could well imagine that this causal or null- cone structure might be the most important element to hold on to in any future generalizations of current physics; yet it seems to be completely lost in the superspace version of quantum geometrodynamics, and one</page><page sequence="15">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 45 would be hard put to see how to recover it in any fundamental way 12a. If the gains were great enough, of course, one would have to put up with such a loss; but since there is not a shred of hard evidence that applica- tion of an existing quantization scheme to existing general relativity theo- ry will be the way forward in physics, one is hesitant to give up lightly what seems such a precious achievement of theoretical physics in our century. Of course, part of the trouble is that the only completely successful quantum theories we have are the non-relativistic theories, with their picture of the wave function (or the operators; it doesn't matter at this level whether we use the Schroedinger or Heisenberg picture) evolving in (absolute) time. Thus, it is always a temptation to by-pass the still quite serious conceptual and formal difficulties in setting up even a completely adequate special-relativistic quantum theory, let alone a general rela- tivistic one, by trying to assimilate relativistic quantum theory to the pattern of non-relativistic quantum theory. Of course, it may eventually turn out that this is the only way forward; but at this point it again seems premature to reach a decision on this question. And of course, many other researchers, who believe in the possibility of quantization of general rela- tivity, are looking for a fully relativistic quantization procedure, perhaps based on the null-cone structure. (4) Perhaps the most serious problem from Wheeler's point of view, and the one that seems to have led him to the abandonment of his original program of the reduction of all of physics to metrical geometry, is the fact that half-integral spin particles could not be treated by quantum geometrodynamics. Quantum theory seems at first sight to alleviate, if not eliminate, the classical distinction between particles and fields by treating all such en- tities by the methods of second quantization and quantum field theory. However, the difference reappears on the level of the distinction between Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac 'particles', statistics and quantization schemes, involving as they do the distinction between the use of sym- metric versus anti-symmetric wave functions, of commutators versus anti-commutators for field operators, etc. These distinctions lead to an exclusion principle for a system of fermions, which forbids more than one such 'particle' (or excitation) from being in a given quantum state; while bosons, obeying no such principle, can build up coherent super-</page><page sequence="16">46 JOHN STACHEL positions of 'particles' (or excitations) with any arbitrary number present in a given state. This has the consequence that the classical limit of a quantized boson 'field' is a classical field; while the classical limit of a quantized fermion 'field' is a classical particle. It is thus no accident that photons were first discovered in the form of the classical electromagnetic field; while electrons were first discovered as seemingly classical particles. The classical matter-field dualism thus reasserts itself within quantum theory as the boson-fermion dualism, and we currently know of no way to eliminate this dualism. But quantum geometrodynamics seems to offer no way to handle the fermions. As Wheeler puts it: Attempts to find a natural place for spin - in Einstein's standard geometrodynamics ... founder because there is no natural way for a change in connectivity to take place within the context of classical differential geometry. After explaining why such a change of connectivity, or spin structure on a manifold would allow the possibility for spinor fields describing half integral spin particles, Wheeler summarizes the difficulty as follows: There is a central difficulty in this enterprise. It assumes and demands on physical grounds that the topology of the three-geometry shall be free to change from one connectivity to another. In contrast, classical differential geometry says, in effect, 'Once one topology, al- ways that topology',.... In other words, one cannot even get the enterprise 'on the road' for want of a natural mathematical way to describe the required change in topology. The idea is therefore abandoned here and now that three-geometry is 'the magic building material of the universe'.13 What is to take the place of geometrodynamics? Wheeler has been im- pressed by the arguments of Sakharov, that rather than trying to explain particles from geometry one should explain geometry by means of par- ticles. "Geometrodynamics is neither as important or as simple as it looks. Do not make it the point of departure in searching for underlying simplicity. Look deeper, at elementary particle physics." This is the tenor of interesting new considerations put forward by Sakharov .... In brief, as elasticity is to atomic physics, so - in Sakharov's view - gravitation is to elementary particle physics. The energy of an elastic deformation is nothing but energy put into the bonds between atom and atom by the deformation. The energy that it takes to curve space is nothing but perturbation in the vacuum energy of fields plus particles brought about by that curvature, according to Sakharov.... Think of a particle as built out of the geometry of space; think of a particle as a 'geometrodynamic exciton'? No model - it would seem to follow from Sakharov's assess-</page><page sequence="17">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 47 ment - could be less in harmony with nature, except to think of an atom as built out of elas- ticity! Elasticity does not explain atoms. Atoms explain elasticity. If likewise, particles fix [G] the [gravitational] constant in Einstein's geometrodynamic law (Sakharov), must it not be unreasonable to think of the geometrodynamic law as explaining particles?14 Thus Wheeler has renounced the fundamental geometrodynamical tenet, that everything must be built out of the metric tensor field; once an advocate of an absolute theory of space-time (not only is the space-time metric absolute, it is everything), he now recognizes the possibility of a relational theory of space-time, in which the metrical properties are de- duced from those of the particles. A number of references to Leibniz by Wheeler make it evident that he is aware of the historical antecedents of this position in the 'great debate' of the Age of Enlightenment between the proponents of absolute and relational theories of space. However, neither he nor Sakharov seem to be aware of the more recent specula- tions of van Dantzig. Starting in the 1930's, indeed, van Dantzig was working on a rather similar program, which he summarized (with refer- ences to his earlier work) in his paper at the Jubilee of Relativity Theory, held in Bern in 1955: ... one might be inclined to consider metrics as describing some 'normal' state of matter (inclusive radiation) and to give it a statistical interpretation as some kind of average of physical characteristics of surrounding events, instead of laying it at the base of the whole of physics. Also the fact that e.g. measurement of length required rigid bodies, i.e. large number of particles, points to a statistical interpretation. It is, however, not yet known how such a statistical interpretation of metric can be obtained. Such a statistical interpretation of metrics does not, of course, deny its physical reality (like in the case of temperature), which hardly will be denied by anyone who ever has been pricked by a needle, i.e. who has felt its rigidity and the smallness of its curvature.15 But Sakharov's approach, undeveloped as it is, leaves Wheeler unsatis- fied. He feels that something more basic must lie at the heart of the world than particles and their properties or geometry: Are electromagnetism and particle fields a manifestation of pure geometry? Or is geometry a mere bookkeeping for relations between particles? Or are particles and geometry both primordial? Or are both derived from something more primordial than either, call it pre- geometry or call it what one will?'6 Some principle uniquely right and uniquely simple must, when one knows it, be also so compelling that it is clear that the universe is built, and must be built, in such and such a way, and that it could not possibly be otherwise. But how can one discover that principle? If it was hopeless to learn atomic physics by studying work-hardening and dislocations, it may be equally hopeless to learn the basic operating principle of the universe, call it pre-</page><page sequence="18">48 JOHN STACHEL geometry or call it what one will, by any amount of work in general relativity and particle physics ... it would seem reasonable to expect primary guidance in the search for pre- geometry to come from a principle both philosophical and powerful, but one also perhaps not destined to be wholly clear in its contents or its implications until some later day."7 In his search for this 'something more primordial', Wheeler is led to ultimately consider the 'quantum principle' as perhaps the only element of physics which has survived, as one law after another of physics has had to be viewed as mutable. But what is this 'quantum principle' itself; what invariant element unites the many incarnations of the quantum concept in physics over the last 75 years? Wheeler suggests that it may be the non-classical calculus of propositions, known to us from the work of the quantum logicians, which may provide the clue: Nothing could seem so preposterous at first glance as the thought that nature is built on a foundation as ethereal as the calculus of propositions. Yet, beyond the push to look in this direction provided by the principle of simplicity, there are two pulls. First, bare-bones quantum mechanics lends itself in a marvelously natural way to formulation in the lan- guage of the calculus of propositions .... Second, the pursuit of reality seems always to take one away from reality .... Little astonishment there should be, therefore, if the description of nature carries one in the end to logic, the etherial eyrie at the center of mathematics. If, as one believes, all mathematics reduces to the mathematics of logic, and all physics reduces to mathematics, what alternative is there but for all of physics to reduce to the mathe- matics of logic? Logic is the only branch of mathematics that can 'think about itself'."8 And now we see revealed starkly the goal towards which Wheeler's thought has always been tending, the identification of thought and being, the logos which is the world. are we destined to return to the deep conception of Parmenides, precursor of Socrates and Plato, that 'what is..., is identical with the thought that recognizes it'? 19 It seems clear to me that it is no current need of theoretical physics that called forth this response from Wheeler; but rather these are his own deeply felt philosophical convictions, which he is trying to impose on current problems of physics. Without wishing to enter here into a detailed discussion of the issues raised by this latest metamorphosis of the geometrodynamic program, let me make a few comments. As I shall discuss in more detail elsewhere, I see no need to construe the mathematical lattice structure, whose impor- tance within quantum mechanics has been emphasized by the quantum logicians, as having a logical interpretation, in any strict sense of the word logic. While such interpretations are possible, as a modal logic for</page><page sequence="19">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 49 example, they add nothing to our understanding of the quantum theory. Thus, I fail to see any warrant, even if one should accept some version of the 'quantum principle' as the most secure insight we have today in theoretical physics, for giving it a logical interpretation. The distinctions between logic, mathematics and physics are subtle and delicate matters to discuss in any depth and detail; but they are important distinctions nonetheless. An equally important and not-so-subtle distinction that we must make, it seems to me, is that between the object-in-thought, which we build up by means of the conceptual structures forming our scientific theories, and the real object, which exists outside of and unaffected by our con- ceptual efforts to grasp it. While I share Wheeler's sense of the mutability of our physical con- cepts, I see no scientific motivation for the search for some underlying unalterable element or elements beyond or behind these changing struc- tures. I think here Wheeler is approaching a Hegelian outlook on the world, in which the Idea, as the ultimate source of all apparently muta- bility, provides the ultimate synthesis for all apparent contradictions. In contrast, I think we have to accept the idea that each of the sciences, as it develops, builds up a system of concepts to characterize its object; and that these conceptual systems will change and develop; on the one hand, as we build up a more and more adequate concept of the object of the science (i.e., an object-in-thought giving us a more and more pro- found knowledge of the.real object); and on the other as various sciences try to relate their objects to each other. The hope to arrive by some intel- lectual leap at an ultimate characterization of the world seems to me to be based on a blurring of this distinction between the real object and the object-in-thought. We have touched on a number of fundamental questions in the course of our Wheelerian Odyssey. We may recall them with the help of the fol- lowing list, which lists a number of polarities with which we have been confronted, either directly or indirectly: fields vs particles bosons vs fermions continuous vs discrete representations of matter infinite vs finite number of degrees of freedom macroscopic vs microscopic</page><page sequence="20">50 JOHN STACHEL classical vs quantum space-time vs matter (in philosophical sense) absolute vs relational theories of space and space-time fundamental vs phenomenological levels of theory I shall close this over-long discussion with some comments on just a few of the issues raised by this list, in no particularly logical sequence. The question of what is and what is not a geometrical aspect of a phys- ical theory is not always a clear and unambiguous one. First of all, we must bear in mind the various levels or aspects of geometrical structure that have entered into physical theories. The manifold level, with its as- sociated topological and differentiable structures; the conformal and projective levels; and the affine and metric levels represent successively richer geometrical structures which find application within existing physical theories. It is not at all clear (to me at least) where one should draw the line and say, here the geometrical aspects of the theory stop. Why is the introduction of a symmetric tensor field to represent the gravitational potentials as well as the chronogeometric properties of a manifold to be taken as an addition to the geometric structure; while the introduction of an antisymmetric tensor field (two-form) to represent the electromagnetic field, for example, into the same manifold is not? The point has been well put by van Dantzig: "It is not quite clear which logical or epistemological advantage there is in interpreting a part of a geometrical object as an electromagnetic field, say, and not vice versa." As he remarks, "Since olden times it has been assumed that the concepts and theories of geometry are prerequisite to those used in mathematical models of other parts of physics [reference omitted]. The reasons for this priority relation, however, seem to be of a historical and traditional rather than of a logical nature." 20 It has been known since Weyl and Cartan's work of the early twenties that Maxwell's equations, apart from the constitutive relations, could be formulated in a bare manifold by introducing two two-forms with appropriate properties; and van Dantzig, in developing his program discussed above, has given several examples of ways of reformulating some physical laws independently of all metrical reference. Are these to be taken as geometrical or non- geometrical elements of the theory? If non-geometrical, by what criterion for decision?</page><page sequence="21">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 51 Certainly the nature of this problem seems to shift radically, once one shifts from the three-dimensional to the four-dimensional point of view. The Newtonian law of inertia, for example, in its three-dimensional for- mulation was always taken as a physical element of the Newtonian theo- ry of mechanics (indeed, an indispensable one, since it singled out the inertial frames), as was Newton's theory of gravitation. Yet, with the four-dimensional formulation of Newtonian mechanics and gravita- tional theory by Cartan, it became clear that both the Newtonian laws of inertia and gravitation are equivalent to the postulation of a certain affine connection in Newtonian space-time; and we are accustomed to think of an affinity as part of the geometrical structure of space-time. Perhaps the distinction between geometrical and non-geometrical as- pects of a theory loses much of its importance with the shift from the three-dimensional to the four-dimensional viewpoint, on the one hand; and the necessity to admit dynamical properties for geometrical elements of the theory, on the other. Once the concept of geometrical aspects of a theory has been thus broadened, and perhaps relativized to a great extent, the question of absolute versus relational theories of geometry seems to take on a dif- ferent significance too. Would it not seem more sensible to talk about absolute and relational aspects of the geometrical structure within a given physical theory; and to recognize that generally a theory will con- tain both aspects? For example, the manifold structure of space-time seems to be an absolute geometrical aspect of all existing physical theo- ries. While geometrodynamics, as originally formulated, envisioned the metric as absolute, from Sakharov's viewpoint, as well as from at least some other interpretations of the formalism of general relativity, the metric is to be viewed as a relational aspect of the geometrical structure. It is not too clear from the comments of Sakharov and Wheeler, but at least one tenable interpretation of this program is that the mani- fold structure will still be taken as absolute, in the presumed derivation of the metric from the properties of various quantized matter fields. Leaving aside the very difficult question of whether one can indeed make sense of existing quantization methods in a situation where no metrical structure is available (which I shall comment on elsewhere), it seems possible to envisage a somewhat different program in which even the manifold structure would be derived in some approximation, at least,</page><page sequence="22">52 JOHN STACHEL from something more fundamental. Indeed, this seems to be part of what Wheeler has in mind in his discussion of pregeometry and the need to break the fixed character of the manifold topology if one is to intro- duce half-integral spin into geometrodynamics. Thus, the nature of an element of the geometrical structure as absolute or relational may be a changing one, depending on the level of theoretical depth at which the question is being considered. Penrose and others have also speculated on the possibility for deriving various geometrical struc- tures of present-day theories from some more basic structures, which, if we can reach a satisfactory definition of 'geometrical', we might agree to call non-geometrical. The reappearance of the classical field-particle polarity within quantum theory as the boson-fermion distinction seems to suggest that this repre- sents a polarity (dualism, if you will) that we shall have to live with for a long time in our theories of physics. All attempts to get rid of it within the quantum framework, such as de Broglie's neutrino theory of light, or Heisenberg's unified theory of elementary particles, both based upon the seductive idea of building bosons out of even numbers of fermions, have met with serious checks. Similarly all attempts to explain the classical level of physical theory exclusively in terms of the quantum level have met with similar checks. We have discussed the Everett interpretation in detail, and seen how it begs this question at the beginning by assuming a fundamental distinction between systems and apparata ('observers' in the usual language). Much recent work on the so-called quantum theory of measurement, when taken out of the particular metaphysical context in which it was placed by von Neumann's original formulation (hardly ever to escape, it seems - I have discussed this topic elsewhere"), bears on this problem. Most promising, in this respect, is the work on quantum systems with an in- finite number of degrees of freedom; with appropriate assumptions such systems do indeed seem to show such classical properties as irreversible behavior. Thus, there seems at least a possibility of relating, if not re- ducing, the classical non-classical polarity to the polarity of finite-infinite number of degrees of freedom. Perhaps the only fairly solid conclusion that I can draw from this discussion is that we have to learn to live with such conceptual polar- ities in our theories of nature, and accept the need to continue utilizing</page><page sequence="23">THE RISE AND FALL OF GEOMETRODYNAMICS 53 the theoretical tensions between them creatively in our future theorizing. The attempts to resolve such polarities, however much they may be motivated by the search for some ultimate unified theory, such as geometrodynamics, always seem to lead us to new polarities, if not to new avatars of the old ones.
