<plain_text><page sequence="1">ERIC WEIL Science in Modern Culture Or the Meaning of Meaninglessness I IF we want to discover the part science plays in our civilization, it will be useful, not to say necessary, to find out what part is at tributed to science by the people?i.e. all of us unless we consider ourselves specialists?who live in this civilization and according to its values. Now, what has common opinion to say about the nature and the impact of science? Science, it proclaims, has made our Ufe what it is, it has modeled and is constantly remodeling our civilization, it dominates our world. But if we ask a cultivated representative of this opinion whether that is the whole truth, he will readily admit that it is not. It is not just science that acts in this way, it is our particular form of science. Although the cultivated man may not give much thought to it, he knows that every cultural system, even the most primitive, transmits to its members knowledge, truth, true rules of practical, moral and technical content, and considers itself the bearer and distributor of "science." But that "science," our imagi nary interlocutor would continue, is not science in our meaning of the word. It does not analyze its objects, it classifies them according to their qualities into families, clans, and tribes; it is qualitative science and, applied, it becomes magic. And though magic may make magnificent promises, it is only we and our science that are able to keep them. We, not they, are able to fly through the air, to Uve under the waters, to hear the voice of the dead. And we have succeeded because our science is objective and does not look for anything but knowledge pure and disinterested, whereas they have failed because their goal was success. Up to this point, it would be difficult not to agree with popular opinion. It is a fact that we in our civilization have become, as Des cartes said, the owners and masters of nature. We have achieved 171</page><page sequence="2">ERIC WEIL this because we renounced "understanding" nature?attributing to her traits that belong only to us, qualities that depend on our phys iological and psychological constitution, intentions, ends, aver sions. We have tried to study her as she is and to read her great book in the language she used?the language of mathematics? instead of writing texts in our human language on pages we our selves fit in. We carried the day, not although, but because we were not pursuing victory. It would be erroneous and unjust to suppose that the common opinion has neglected this side of the facts, and that people look only at results. It is commonly known that men of science are, at least ideally, "disinterested," that research is "pure," that those who do research do not necessarily strive for results that would be inconceivable without their work. But it is precisely this split appreciation, this contradictory view that ought to preoccupy us. Science is good because it is useful and gives riches, power, and comfort; and at the same time it is the noblest of human pursuits. Science is the mainstay of our economic, social, and political life; and the man of science is the successor to the sages of old to whom popular opinion applies, often in a most touching manner, for an swers to questions that have nothing to do with his special compe tence, simply because he is considered objective, disinterested, un partisan, and wise. II The situation is paradoxical enough to justify a, necessarily sketchy, historical inquiry: it will not solve the problem, because history, correctly understood, does not even pretend to be able to do so, but it may help to bring it better into focus. The root of the matter is that our double-faced idea of science stems from two different origins. There was, to start with, a "disin terested" science, which was not conceived as an instrument to master and appropriate nature; it refused every intervention in the course of nature; it did not want to dominate, it was in pursuit of understanding. It even rejected experimentation, in our sense, i.e., the search of measurable, and thus mathematically describable, un derlying factors (though it knew of course experimentation in the form of trial and error). Its analysis was conceptual, in other words metaphysical; it did not subject nature, as Kant proclaimed modern classical physics does, to questioning under conditions forced upon her by the questioner in order that he may receive measurable indi 172</page><page sequence="3">Science in Modem Culture cations. So it is not surprising that the most respected figures in sci ence kept clear of technology. Archimedes, who was a great engi neer as weU as a great scientist, did not publicize his inventions, because he feared for his honor. Science was theoria, pure view, not praxis. It would be a mistake to believe that this attitude died with the aristocratic civilization that gave birth to it. It did not change much when modern science was born?or rather, reborn from Greek sources. Galilei's fame rested not on his remarkable engineering per formances, which brought him jobs and money, but on discoveries whose practical value in the eyes of his contemporaries was at first practically nil: in 1600 astronomy and the theory of free fall did not promise usefulness. Galilei built instruments for precise observation, not machines?it has been the great merit of A. Koyr? to have in sisted upon this fundamental and often neglected distinction. Leo nardo da Vinci's history is different: he was not shy of being an en gineer, but he was not a man of mathematical science. When Leonardo spoke of mechanics as the "noblest and the most useful of sciences," he was not in possession of a mathematical theory of me chanics nor did he seem to seek one. When he wrote, "Mechanics is the paradise of mathematical sciences, because with it we reach the fruit of mathematics," it is his reason that is important, not his ap preciation. Descartes and Newton built instruments, as did many other natural philosophers, but though some of their creations may have been of great technical utility, witness Huyghens' clocks, they were not conceived and executed with a view toward their extra scientific utility. But there was another strand at the dawn of modern science, which derived from the revolutionary discoveries of the Middle Ages. During that period of the eclipse of pure, theoretical science, men whose names will forever remain unknown had created things of decisive importance: ways to harness non-human energy, and methods of employing animal forces, with an efficiency antiquity had never attained. Transport had been transformed and industries were created that relied on sources of energy the Greeks and Ro mans had certainly known but had not learned to domesticate ef fectively. On the other hand during the later Middle Ages cities in the most developed parts of Europe had become autonomous in two senses: they had grown relatively independent of both central au thority and their powerful neighbors, and they had ceased to be im portant only as residences and capitals of princes and bishops. The 173</page><page sequence="4">ERIC WEIL new bourgeois society, which was throwing off the values of its nat ural enemy, feudal aristocracy, gave empirical engineering a chance to become respectable. These two tendencies began to act on one another at the time of the Renaissance.* Scientists took cognizance of inventions, even though they neither were nor wanted to be inventors, and engines became objects of study for them. It is no accident, for instance, that Galilei so often chooses the cannon as an example or that baUistics is one of the main subjects of early research. To the "modern" phi losophers, these new devices deserved scientific analysis quite as much as did natural objects. The situation remained the same for a long time: the steam engine had worked well for more than a gener ation before the corresponding mathematical theory was created. But as soon as that stage was reached, the two streams began to flow together. Practice began to act on theory by building what then be came problems for science, and science, by solving the problems so born, offered the engineer the possibility of calculating, before he built his machines, their effects and the conditions for their safe and remunerative operation. This fusion, which began during the XVIIth century in some fields, became a universal phenomenon toward the end of the XVIIIth century. Modern industry and the science that it both pre supposes and fosters have realized Descartes' dream?which was an old one even in his time. Here a new question arises: why did this fusion not happen earlier, since both technicians and scientists were present in the towns? A realistic answer is that if the inteUectual conditions were already in existence, the new relation between mathematical theory and empirical practice became an historically * Not to make complex things even more complicated, I have omitted inten tionally one other strand of the utmost importance, but which in the history of ideas has played its part mainly in furnishing justifications for new attitudes it would probably not have produced by itself. The Bible considers the world, natural and historical, as a cosmos, but as one that is not understandable di rectly, as it is for Greek theoria: it is consistent and meaningful as the result of divine planning, which planning is essentially hidden from human eyes and intellect. The world is meaningful, but only for a faith that believes in a mean ing it cannot discover in this earthly existence. On the other hand, Adam, while depending for his understanding on God, is the master, under God, of the whole creation. When the divine mediation between fact and meaning is negated or even doubted, the modern situation (which will be analyzed in the following pages) results quite naturally. The importance of these remarks for the present topic will appear later, although I shall not take them up again. They are put here to avoid the reproach of overlooking a decisive factor. 174</page><page sequence="5">Science in Modem Culture important factor because the political situation prevailing first in Italy, and later over all of Western Europe, was unique. Europe comprised a number of independent states, similar in wealth and power, each of which had as its paramount interest the defense of its frontiers and/or the aggrandizement of its territory. Now techni cal questions would play a decisive part in this uninterrupted strug gle among equals: communications, artillery, money flowing from in dustry and commerce, these were the factors upon which power came to depend even more than on territory and population. No wonder, then, that the first technical schools, all of them fostered by government, either turned out mining engineers, as in Germany, or were conceived as schools for future officers of artillery and technical troops, as in France. It is interesting to note that the first definition of engineer in the Concise OED still reads: "One who designs and constructs military engines or works." Technology, unlike empirical techniques, came into being because princes needed technicians and money?under Louis XIV Colbert's mercantilists system im ported whole industries?siege machines, roads, and canals. Princes wanted power, and they came to understand that knowledge pro cures it. Unlike the oriental despots who were free to exploit their subjects because the outer barbarians and conquered peoples had no possibility of going over to a better master, the western powers had need of experts and specialists to help them compete with powers equal to their own. The science that they used and depended on was, however, an existing science, and it is worthwhile to ask why this science had arisen in Europe during the XVIth and XVIIth centuries?this dis interested science, pure, mathematical, non-qualitative, non-explica tive. When Newton said that he did not invent hypotheses, he meant that he did not pretend to know what gravitation was in it self, which would have been the natural question for a metaphy sician; he wanted only to describe how it worked and to give an ad equate mathematical account of observed phenomena. The same attitude is present in the thinking of all the great creators of modern physics, although one can observe how difficult and even impossible it was for men like Kepler and Galilei to eliminate every trace of an thropocentrism or anthropomorphism from their thinking. Disinter ested or what Max Weber has called "value free" science became the idea and the ideal, in a sense?the difference is decisive?which was unknown to antiquity, for according to the philosophers science led to a world-view that satisfied the human needs of human 175</page><page sequence="6">ERIC WEIL beings, were it only by allowing them to accede to the beautiful, to the absolutely beautiful spectacle of the cosmos. The change is rev olutionary: how did it happen? It seems to have grown out of the changing attitude toward re ligion; at a time when religion was discredited in the eyes of many people or, through a reaction against this attitude, became the cen ter of theological and political strife, "value-free" science remained as the sole refuge for people with purely intellectual interests and no vocation for martyrdom?this science that had nothing to do with what had up to that moment been considered the fundamental values. It was a return to the Greek theoria of the cosmos, which Kepler among many others endeavored to maintain, but which the new "philosophy" of Bruno and the new "cosmology" of Descartes were to destroy replacing it with the silent infinity of homogenous unoriented space and innumerable interchangeable particles of matter. In Galilei's famous trial, behind aU the misunderstandings and worse, there may well have been on the part of his persecutors an unconscious fear, not of his particular cosmology, but of any science that eliminated aU values foreign to mathematical science. Such hypotheses have more than historical importance. They enable us to understand how our present situation originated, and how was born what we may caU the common attitudes of our day, with their contradictory, though historically complementary, as pects. Nothing, the common opinion holds, can be done without dis interested science, but what we are reaUy interested in is the results. The ideal of precision, which is often caUed rationalism, and that of helping men, nations, the whole of humanity, are fused, as they were already for Descartes, who saw clearly that "the fruits of the tree of science" could advance medical knowledge. Ill Physics has become the archetype of true science, f oUowed by all the sciences (and technologies). Precision through mathematical analysis may not yet prevail in aU of science, for the biological, so cial, and historical sciences have not yet overcome their methodo logical troubles, but they aU strive to become "exact," objective, value-free.* They aspire to objectivity because only in this way can they attain power, as physics has attained it in its field. But the * One of the first and always best analyses of this situation has been given by Max Weber in his famous lecture Wissenschaft als Beruf. 176</page><page sequence="7">Science in Modem Culture power they seek is the control of history; we are becoming progres sively better able to analyze economical, social, strategic situations and to predict results and discover the necessary conditions of suc cess, in a word, to direct events. Thus it is no wonder that popular opinion is struck by present and foreseeable results. Men of science may weU wonder whether the pubUc is not over-optimistic in its confidence that everything can be bettered, all evils eradicated, poverty vanquished, iUness over come, perhaps even death pushed out of the perfect world to come. But their skepticism should not persuade them that the great ma jority of humanity does not hold these views. The debates of the United Nations and their agencies on underdeveloped countries and ways to help them, to give only one illustration, may be consid ered largely propaganda by many self-styled realists, hard-headed in perhaps more than one sense; but this propaganda would fail if it did not appeal to deep and widespread attitudes, convictions, and even mythologies, and if it did not therefore command very real and serious reactions. Men of science may think that the explicit and im plicit promises of progress made by communism, for instance?and what it offers is just mastery over nature and over history?cannot be fulfilled in the near future and for the whole of humanity; but it can scarcely be denied that about half the population of the earth has accepted that system, be it only passively ( and that is open to doubt), and that another fraction may be ready to join them unless they receive from some other source what communism holds out to them. It may even be asked whether the skeptic does not contra dict himself. What he says is not that the enterprise is impossible; he maintains that it is extremely complex, that poor nations wiU not get rich overnight, that profound transformations will be required in their reUgious convictions, their family system, their social organiza tion. But he seems to forget that precisely by raising these objec tions he accepts the principle: there will be progress, he says, if the conditions enumerated by social science are fulfilled?which signi fies that, according to him, these prerequisites are known or can be elucidated and that, in principle, science can do the job // it is al lowed to direct the operation; he does not doubt of science, but rather of the intelligence of the people and their leaders. Pure objective value-free science and the idea of man's universal domination over nature and history have come together, and it is not probable that this aUiance will be broken. But it remains an al Uance, it has not become a unity of fundamental values and outlook. 177</page><page sequence="8">ERIC WEIL Science stays pure, while technology uses and very often inspires disinterested research but keeps its basic interest in results. The scientist is not an engineer, the engineer is not a scientist, although they collaborate; they have been brought together. And that is pre cisely the source of the problem: is our civilization rent by this du aUty of outlook and purpose, or is it unified by the interdependence that history has introduced? Is the rift between knowledge and power?if these two terms may be aUowed to designate the ideals of the two sides?equivalent to disruption, or is their coming together the fundamental unity of our culture? Was Plato right in afiBrming that only pure knowledge of eternal truth deserves to be pursued? Or was Saint-Simon s perspective the correct one when he wanted for humanity mastery over history through mastery over nature and through scientific organization? Or is it possible that the rift, if it is one, was characteristic of an earUer stage of our civilization and is gradually being bridged? It is said that there is more disinterested science in our day than there has ever been before; but it can be an swered that the proportion of pure to applied science has dropped constantly since the day when all science was disinterested. More money and time are being expended on fundamental research now than during any period of the known past; but those who allot the money and so give other people the leisure and means to do re search?the governments, business concerns, foundations?may simply have discovered that this kind of work leads, in a way that no one can foresee, to very profitable results, if input and output are compared. Disinterested science is paying dividends, as the Russians found when they learned that the A-bomb was built with the help of the "ideaUstic" physics which, judging from a meta physical viewpoint, they had looked upon as antithetical to "class in terest" and unforgivably "objectivistic." So it might seem that there was once a problem of opposition between knowledge and power, between pure science and technology: is the conflict stiU with us? Has the fusion between them already occurred, or has it at least be gun? Is science to become a tool, necessary and highly respected, for acquiring total mastery over nature and history? It would look as if it were to play exactly that part, and as if the philosophical in terpretations of science offered by pragmatism and instrumentalism were justified?if there did not remain a lingering doubt, though of quite another order. We can still ask whether our civilization is to grow more meaningful or whether, left to itself, it will become more schizophrenic if it goes the way that observed facts are indicating, 178</page><page sequence="9">Science in Modem Culture toward mastery for mastery's sake, with nothing to tell us with sci entific, value free objectivity which values are to guide us in the use of this mastery. The fears and the unrest of our day are there to show that this is not just an intellectual's empty problem. IV The preceding considerations and questions have shown at the very least that facts wiU not lead us any further. We are faced with a choice and a decision. And although only fools take their decisions without looking at the facts, nobody has ever made up his mind by looking at them exclusively unless he had made his choice uncon sciously like the pragmatist who knows in his bones that success, whatever that may be, is good and that the proof of the pudding is in the eating (which is quite true of puddings and pudding eaters, i.e., people who know that puddings are good). Modern science is objective and, considered in itself, pure the ory. It has thrown out anthropomorphism and anthropocentrism. It has inherited the Greek idea of scientific truth as a system of con sistent discourse, but with one important modification. It has not retained the idea that knowledge of the world leads man to knowl edge about himself by indicating the best way of life, because mod ern science does not admit of a meaningful world that can be under stood the way Plato and all the Greek philosophers thought they understood the cosmos. Nature for modern physics and "cosmology" is just what it is, or rather it is what science says it is, exactly as "hu man" sciences describe historical worlds whose factual structures can be discovered, without conveying any meaning valid for the his torian, the economist, or the social anthropologist in their own lives. Any meaning that these structures held for the participants is a mere fact to the social sciences. That is one aspect of modern sci ence. The other is that this science has rendered possible human action upon conditions that have never before been considered mod ifiable. Not that science sought this result?although many men of science had been looking for it. Science was not pursuing anything but pure knowledge. Nevertheless, the combination of certain peo ple and certain situations caused science to become "interesting"? as an instrument of power over nature, history, natural resources, and human beings. Probably it was no accident. When science renounces anthropocentrism, it is bound to be at the service of the most primitive interest, the acquisition of power. Our culture has 179</page><page sequence="10">ERIC WEIL developed a split personaUty, rent between its thirst for objective truth and its desire for power. And curiously enough, this schism results not through any fault of technology and applied social sci ence, but through the fact that the most disinterested and purest form of science refuses to pronounce on questions which by their very nature are not "objective" because they concern ways of life. V It is a problem of good and bad, of the desirable and its opposite. Facts cannot solve it, and science cannot even formulate it in its own language. So it will be necessary to go back to fundamentals and to introduce some classical philosophical distinctions. What does it mean when we say that science is value-free, disin terested? The expression is evidently unsatisfactory, for it is pre cisely the pure researcher who finds his work supremely interesting and of the greatest value. The underlying equivocation is easy to clear up: interest may be attached either to something valuable in itself, or to something useful toward attaining a valuable end. The difference is the old one between facts and values. To say that a thing is interesting or desirable in itself is a value judgment, but to say that some given factor is necessary in order to obtain a desir able end is a judgment of fact, or a judgment concerning the factual relations among facts. I cannot offer scientific proof of my value judgments, but I can and must do so when I speak of facts and their relations. Now, it has been common knowledge, at least since Hume's days, that there is no path from fact to value. Science is concerned with facts exclusively, and science alone is quahfied to distinguish what is a fact from what is not. Value judgments are not scientific nor can they become so. The theory has often been presented, and G. E. Moore has given it a particularly influential form with his criticism of the "naturalistic fallacy": According to Moore, from the fact that a thing is done, it does not follow logically (though it could easily follow pragmatically) that it ought to be done. But it may well be asked whether this purely negative statement is suf ficient to elucidate the relations between facts and values. It would be only an apparent objection to say that certain sci ences are concerned with values, for example, sociology and psy chology. For these sciences the values become objects of observa tion and enquiry, they are analyzed as facts and studied the way 180</page><page sequence="11">Science in Modem Culture constitutions are or the change in price of basic commodities or military techniques or rituals, though there may be specific difficul ties in finding out which values certain people at a given time regard as decisive and central to their way of life. In principle the science of value facts is value free. Mistaken though it is, the objection leads nevertheless to a point of positive importance. Values, it is said, are being studied as facts. True, but they interest us not in isolation but as value systems, as more or less consistent rules, sometimes explicit, sometimes to be discovered through long and complex analyses. The different values of a culture, or of a religion or a political party, cannot be unrelated among themselves. If these values are to offer direction and meaning to a group's life, they ought to permit not so much survival (for groups have sacrificed their lives at the feet of their values) as guidance, i.e. consistency: coordination between values is indis pensable to the formation of the decisions of the group and its members. Unrelated values lead not to justified but to arbitrary choices. Values form value systems, and that signifies that in each value field a logical, and thus decidable, discussion is possible and that rules can be elaborated for it (though there is no necessity for doing it). People who adhere to the same set of values may not only formulate problems concerning choices, they may even solve them, simply by pointing out that this or that action would be inconsistent with this or that part of the system, or that introducing new values would disrupt its consistency. Value systems in this way establish the possibility of rational discourse and discussion. But they do so only for those who accept the fundamental value axioms of a given civilization, or given morals or esthetics. There is no discussion between systems that have no common axioms. Thus science, even in its most formal definition as consistent discourse, cannot do the job of choosing between different sets. That is not all, for we are now bound to apply this result to ob jective science itself, and to its principal exigency, consistency. Dis interestedness, objectivity, and so forth are values; science has no way of proving that they ought to be values, because the very idea of proof?the appeal to consistency of discourse?presupposes that these values have been acknowledged beforehand. We shall have to say, since there is no other possibility, that these values are basic to our civilization. But that admission reverses, and completes, the the sis of absolute separation between facts and values in a highly sur prising manner. Facts depend upon science and on the questions 181</page><page sequence="12">ERIC WEIL asked by the scientist, because it is he who decides which facts are relevant, i.e., are scientific facts; thus facts depend upon the spirit in which these questions are formulated, on the scientist's axioms; and the choice of these axioms is actually a choice, in other words, a value judgment. It is certainly true that values do not follow from facts, but it now appears that facts become relevant only through values. No facts in our sense of the word exist where there is no ob jective, disinterested science. Every attempt to prove scientifically the value of science is nothing but a circulus in probando. It is tempting at this point to fall back on the idea of mastery over nature and history as a justification, though pragmatic, of the value of consistency. And that is actually what popular thought and instrumentalist philosophy are trying to do. It is to no avail, for two different and equally strong reasons. First, the idea of power on which such a demonstration would be founded could not lead to any result, unless power were already considered desirable. In this way power would constitute one of the basic, axiomatic values, the vaUdity of which is precisely the object of scrutiny. Secondly, if this justification presents itself as valid, it presupposes that the value of consistency, without which no valid proof can be conceived, has been acknowledged at the outset?and this is precisely the value to be justified. That does not imply that power cannot be accepted as a fundamental value, or that science can never be treated as in strumental. Examples of such a choice are abundant, even among philosophers. All we can say then is that consistency is a fundamental value in our civilization. It is not the fundamental value, for if it were, the present problem of possible disruption would not exist. But it is fundamental at least for every "reasonable" discussion of disruption, since without it decidable discussion becomes impossible. Never theless, and this also is a fact and therefore contingent, other people have made other choices and we too can always decide in favor of another option. Reason (or consistency) can be considered as a neg ative value: Nietzsche and Heidegger, not to mention older and greater men such as Luther, or more unpleasant ones like Hitler and his "thinkers," have done so. Here, however, we are thinking about our civilization in a consistent manner i.e. scientifically, or we are at least trying to do so. What we discover is that science and consist ency are unable to justify fundamental values, and particularly themselves, as necessary. Could that be the real reason for our en visaging science as a disruptive factor in our culture? One thing at 182</page><page sequence="13">Science in Modem Culture least is evident: no civilization could worry about its consistency and unity unless it adhered to the values of consistency and fact. Scien tifically (or, if the term is preferred, logically), we can show that there is no justification for values, that, as Dostoyevsky said, every thing is possible when no transcendental value is acknowledged as irrefutable and undisputable. And so, logically, scientific thought seems to have undermined its own basis. VI Max Weber, who has already been quoted, had the rare and ad mirable courage to accept the consequences of this analysis, and not much has been added to his declaration that values belong in the realm of preachers and prophets, not in that of science. His own op tion, he declared, was for science, because science gave him the possibility of being honest with himself (he referred, of course, to the social sciences and especially of his own pursuits, sociology and history). He thought he could explain what this option included as presuppositions on one hand, as exigencies on the other, but he con sidered quite illegitimate any attempt to prove that his choice was the only good one. Such intellectual honesty and courage?quaUties even rarer than his stupendous learning?certainly deserve respect. But even great men are fallible, and the problem is so serious that we must consider the possibiUty of his being in error. Weber had started by separating in the Kantian manner the fields of values ("freedom") and facts ("nature"), though actually he had taken over this distinction not from Kant himself, but from certain neo-Kantians. This is not just a pedantic point of learning: Kant himself, in his last writings, had insisted upon the moral neces sity (sollen) of a union or reunion of the two realms: life, ac tion, science itself, he had come to think, would be inconceivable if meaning, i.e. values, did not exist and if reality were value free, and therefore meaningless. The result of his complex, and often confus ing but probably never confused, thinking was that, since value free science i? a human pursuit, it is possible only in a structured and meaningful world, not a "world of values" but a real world, full of sense for man if he chooses to look for it. No choice would be imag inable in a magma of facts, nor could there be choice under condi tions of total value entropy. This is the point that Weber did not see, nor is it discerned by many scholars of philosophy, such as the positivists and most adher 183</page><page sequence="14">ERIC WEIL ents of linguistic analysis. We are born into a world, not into a dis connected multiplicity of facts and values. Only existing values may be rejected, transformed, or re-evaluated, because every action against old, and in favor of new, values starts from existing values (and those who fight given values are often more dominated by them than is the lax believer). Science, considered as human activ ity founded on certain values, does not give us a world, it originates in a world that has become what it is in history or, if more philo sophical language is preferred, through successive self-interpreta tions of men, which in their turn can be understood. Weber, great historian though he was, in his reflections on history had become a historicist, regarding all value systems as equivalent, and projecting all of them on the same plane. Consistent value systems ("ideal types") are indispensable for a consistent, and understanding, inter pretation of history and human attitudes.* But the human attitudes present in history are no more consistent than fall is free in nature, although real fall is understood by reference to "ideal" fall. We do not choose our values before we start living. The world is always un derstood before it becomes questionable; it can become dubious only if we start from an anterior orientation. Understanding pre cedes science. VII Let us sum up. Science is value-free, though it is based on values, among which, paradoxically enough, freedom from value judg ments is one of the first; and life is directed by values. Science has shaped our natural and social surroundings and goes on doing so; without disinterested science, mastery over nature and history would be impossible. And science has no means to tell us what we are to do with this mastery, nor whether it is good or bad in itself. If there were an answer, it would establish unity; but it would not be given by science. Popular opinion is wrong when it looks upon sci entists as the successors of the sages of old. To consider science as the universal measuring rod for values is an unscientific ideology: when a scientist answers a question in the field of values, he is speaking not as a man of science, but as an ordinary believer, citi zen, moral subject, although his schooling may?sometimes?help him to be more consistent and clearheaded than his neighbors. But refutations, as a rule, destroy neither ideologies nor the * The constitution of such pure value systems becomes in its turn a fact and a factor in history. 184</page><page sequence="15">Science in Modem Culture feelings that find expression in rationaUzations. The opposition be tween facts and values is itself a fact, and a very important one. Un til it is clearly and critically stated, it prevents us from asking the only questions that could possibly lead out of a situation in which power is no guide, science refuses to be one, and the important things in life?choices, decisions, in a word values?are considered completely arbitrary, since everything not arbitrary belongs to the realm of science, the scientifically arbitrary character of whose foun dations is conveniently forgotten. The fundamental attitude can be caUed scientism: only what can be established scientifically is true, objective, and valid everywhere and for everybody (madmen ex cepted), whereas the remainder of human discourse has nothing to do with truth, although this remainder is in fact the greater part and the more important one for human beings as such (scientists not excepted ). It is this scientism that leads to historicism, not chronolog ically since historicism is far older, but logically: values are contin gent facts in history, which is itself contingent since it cannot be deduced in the manner of a law of mathematical physics. The surpris ing thing is that science itself has no pretensions to directing choices and decisions, whereas scientism, before taking seriously what es sentially preoccupies man, exacts the kind of proof and justifica tion that, according to its own interpretation, science has no way of offering. In the terminology of psychoanalysis, scientism is fight ing a superego of its own creation, but which it considers as a domi nating reality, independent of us and our options. The answer, al ready outlined, is that science is a human activity in a world that man understands and understood before he tried to know it scien tifically, a world he has Uved in before, and while, creating sciences and methods. There are questions about this world, but our wonder (the first step toward science and universally valid knowledge, ac cording to Plato and Aristotle) begins only when, in a world that is famiUarly understood and trusted, something "goes wrong." We un derstand the world before we question it: understanding, in an anthropocentric manner, is older than science and more profound. It is an absurd wish to reduce understanding to science. Science as interpreted by scientism?and we have seen that this interpretation is no accident?has become a disruptive factor in our culture on a profound, probably the profoundest, level. If an illustra tion were needed, it could be found in that divorce of classical "hu manities" and "artistic" history from "science" which, in extreme though not rare cases, leads to distrust, contempt, and voluntary iso 185</page><page sequence="16">ERIC WEIL lation on both sides. Preaching is not serious, and research is in no way qualified to influence our lives, so run the feelings of the inter ested parties: of what good is poetry, art, history, philosophy, or a pure physics that culminates in A-bombs and theories understand able and satisfying only to specialists? This is not to imply that these convictions are universal, even less that they are justified; but they exist, and scientism, which is their ignored root, is unable to fight them even if among the proponents of scientism there are probably few who do not deplore the absence of more positive relations be tween the two fields. The underlying fact is that the exact natural and social sciences have everything to do with knowing, and nothing to do with understanding the world we live in, and thus they cannot give us the means to justify our fundamental decisions. These nat ural and social sciences, no doubt, are doing an admirable job of pointing out both the conditions for success and the consequences of possible decisions, but even this falls short of a solution of the real problem, since we might always be willing to accept the conse quences, however dire, or the prerequisites, however hard they may be to realize: consequences and conditions belong to the realm of facts, while options depend on values. This is not to recommend a return to old, and presumably better, times. Rousseau overlooked the fact that his ideal had meaning only in and for the world he opposed; and Thoreau withdrew to his (relative) wilderness because he was civilized. Science and its off spring, technology, have come to stay, and we shall have to Uve with them. The question is, first, how we are to do so without pro ducing more and more split personaUties, particularly among the best educated and most serious people, and, second, how we are to prevent those drunk with this new power from exercising in our name the acquired mastery over nature and history in order to dominate us for domination's sake. Not that power in itself is bad. Lord Acton in his famous saying saw only one side. Indeed, absolute power corrupts absolutely; but the slave's ethic of absolute impo tence is not healthier. VIII What then is required? The answer comes to this: we must think our world and our condition as human beings. We must relegate science and mastery to their proper place, which will always be an important place, or, to put it somewhat paradoxically, we must learn to consider the problem of science instead of thinking only in 186</page><page sequence="17">Science in Modem Culture the framework of science, and we must consider the problem of power, and not only think in the categories of power. From the time when Socrates brought philosophy from heaven down to earth, as the old saying goes, and, instead of studying as tronomy and Ionian physics, began to seek an understanding of human problems and relations, until Kant's and Hegel's days, that has been the work of philosophy. Plato admired science (he even fathered our idea of pure theory) and no one who ignored geometry was aUowed into his Academy?which signifies that mathematics and consistent thinking were in his eyes prerequisites to be acquired outside his school, where his students were to learn something very different from science in the narrow sense. For Plato the essential questions centered on values or rather (to avoid the current confu sion of values with things appreciated) on the question of good and evil. It was no secret for Plato that we make choices, that the world he lived in (and where we live as well) offers many "values"?ways of life, objects and situations that qualify as desirable or detestable? and that the choice is free if we are prepared to take the consequen ces. But he saw at the same time that this world in which we make choices is not just a sum of disconnected data of fact and value, nor even of isolated or isolable value systems. Men are fighting over val ues, but not in a meaningless struggle; they do so in a living and meaningful history. And if they have decided, not so much in favor of good against evil as such, but in favor of declaring this thing good and that bad, they may come to terms, provided they want to do so. There is no demonstration that Socrates can use against Callicles in the Gorgias: he can only teU a myth and explain that Callicles, if he persists in his ways, will destroy human relations as weU as all possi bility of understanding the world. Science was supremely impor tant in Plato's view, but only because it gave the individual the indis pensable schooling in consistent thinking, not because it was good in itself. What has happened is that modern science has become autono mous, a value in itself. The result is that we have a sort of bad meth odological conscience as soon as we are faced with questions con cerning the meaning of our lives. It is no longer a simple question of finding out which things are good or bad: good and bad have them selves become suspect or, if one prefers less old-fashioned words, meaningful and meaningless have suffered this destiny. If a feeling of insecurity is so visible when people leave their special field, and their unpreparedness so obvious when they dare to wander? 187</page><page sequence="18">ERIC WEIL which is a risk taken by the best?then the old task of philosophy ought, once again, to become urgent. Has it in fact done so? One may well doubt it. Philosophy, particularly in the English speaking world, has become scientific, whereas on the continent it prefers more and more to ignore science and the problems it has given birth to. "Serious" philosophers renounce the very idea of justifying values: at most, they are interested in the formal consis tency of existing value systems, among which they declare them selves unable to establish differences in value. It is a second-level activity, a reflection on differences in speech and meanings, when it is not turning into mathematical logic. That is not a smaU or negli gible enterprise: most of the things said here are being said by this philosophy, which has most effectively pursued the necessary work of eliminating ambiguous statements and, even more usefully, am biguous and meaningless questions and pseudo-problems. Every body who wants to think straight, and not waste time and energy on quests which a priori cannot succeed, owes that school a debt of deep gratitude. But it has bought its positive results at too high a price. It has become scientist itself, in accepting as its only criteria the formal ones of science. Life, fortunately or unfortunately, and choices and decisions are not always logicaUy consistent, nor can they always be. Analytical philosophy has thrown to the wolves of arbitrariness all that cannot be seized with the only method it con siders legitimate, although it admits that the remainder that lies outside scientific thought plays a very great role in life. It has taken up Max Weber's theses, but in quite another spirit, seeing liberation where Max Weber discovered reasons for, at best, hope against aU the motives for despair. It is able to throw out "metaphysical" ques tions and discover the structure of scientific discourse in the exact sciences and?in principle, though the work is far less advanced? in the historical, social and anthropological sciences, but it has not been able to discover or even to ask what it means to live, as we do after all, in a meaningful world, in a living and lived nature and history, and not in those consciously abstract worlds of the physicist and the professional historian and anthropologist. Above all, analyti cal philosophy is not able and does not desire to discover what we beings are who Uve in this world and in it have built sciences, tech nologies, and analytical or pragmatic philosophy. The evident objection will be that such a desire?some wiU caU it a dream, others a program?cannot be fulfilled without opening the door for every kind of arbitrariness and handing over philosophy to the very people we are aU afraid of, irresponsible announcers of 188</page><page sequence="19">Science in Modem Culture imaginary salvations and absurd panaceas. The danger is real. But that danger does not come from man's wish to understand himself and his world. It is always with us, and it has been with us more than ever since science renounced meaning and chose the ideal of exact knowledge. This choice is in itself unimpeachable, as long as its axioms are not applied in a field where they became inoperative. There they become even destructive, not because they ask for con sistency, but because their means are appropriate only to their particular field and produce inconsistency when civilization as a whole becomes the problem. The danger would not be greater, it would be less, if the question of meaning were put clearly and if its urgency were considered; it would be great indeed?and will al ways be so, as long as human beings are born violent, and may remain so?but it would be seen and not hidden as it is so often in present-day thought. There may even be hope for a more positive answer, if it is true that we live in a world, and not among a stream of electrons, and that we are beings with feelings and thoughts, and not just objects for psychology, physiology, economics, and social sciences. The an swer would not be scientific, if that means incontrovertible; it would have to be pursued?and to be found?in historical life where con sistency is never given nor presupposed but is only an end to be realized, where the different conceptions of man and world do not exist side by side, as historicism sees them, but are in constant inter action, interfere with one another, fight and become reconciled. It could be found in an analysis of the structure of world and man, or more precisely, in an analysis of man's actions and discourses which would reveal what is his world and what he is for himself. And it might be possible that such an analysis, an understanding analysis of understanding, would give us an opening toward the discovery of what is good for man. It is, I should like to repeat, a program, or at best a promise. But the program might itself be necessary, unless we are decided to give in to arbitrariness in the things that are the most important ones for us, not as scientists and technicians of nature and society, but for us in our lives. Of course, to choose such a program would again be an arbitrary option: no one can prove its necessity to those who reject consistency and understanding. But it would be an ultimate choice, between violence and reason, if such old-fashioned terms can be printed nowadays; and it would not be a negligible result if it were shown that there is an ultimate choice. 189</page></plain_text>
