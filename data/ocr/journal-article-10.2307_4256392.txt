WOUNAAN AND EMBERA USE AND MANAGEMENT OF THE FIBER PALM ASTROCARYUM STANDLEY- ANUM (ARECACEAE) FOR BASKETRY IN EASTERN PANAMA. Economic Botany 55(1):72-82, 2001. This study examines the use of Astrocaryum standleyanum for basketry by Wounaan and Emberd artisans in Panama. Fibers from the palm are a traditional source of material for baskets, which have become commercial art items within the lastfifteen years. Data on palm use were collected over two years, largely from Darien Province. Results indicate that the palm is destructively harvested, usually for a single spear leaf. Artisans remove the fibers from the pinnae and color them with dye plants. Astrocaryum standleyanum strands are sewn around a foundation of Carludovica palmata to make coiled baskets. Wounaan weavers are considered the better artisans, perhaps because of cultural traditions or a longer history with art vendors. The sale of A. standleyanum baskets is an important source of cash income, with both domestic and international sales. The destructive har- vesting of palms threatens the industry and suggestions are made for sustainable harvest. USO Y MANEJO DE LA PALMA DE FIBRA ASTROCARYUM STANDLEYANUM (ARECACEAE) PARA CESTERfA POR LOS WOUNAAN Y EMBERA EN EL ESTE DE PANAMA. Este estudio examina el uso de la palma Astrocaryum standleyanum para cesteria por artesanos Wounaan y Emberd en Panamd. Fibras de la palma son una fuente tradicional de material para canastas, las cuales han llegado a ser objetos de arte comercial en los liltimos quince anos. Se colectaron datos sobre el uso de la palma durante dos aios, por la mayor parte en la provincia de Darien. Resultados indican que la palma se cosecha destructivamente, normalmente solo para una linica hoja bandera. Artesanas remueven las fibras de las pinas y las tinien con plantas. Se cosen hilos de Astro- caryum standleyanum en vueltas alrededor una fundacion de Carludovica palmata para hacer canastas enrolladas. Tejedoras Wounaanes son reconocidas como las mejores artesanas, tal vez por sus tradiciones culturales o su historia larga con vendedoras de arte. La venta de canastas de A. standleyanum es una fuente importante de ingresos de efectivo, con ventas domesticas e internacionales. La cosecha destructiva de palmas amenaza la industria y se han propuesto sugerencias para la cosecha sostenible. Key Words: Astrocaryum standleyanum; Embera; Fiber; Palm Basketry; Panama; Wounaan. Astrocaryum standleyanum L.H. Bailey is one of many nontimber forest products used by Wou- naan and Embera indigenous artisans as the pri- mary material for their commercial ethnic art. Known locally in Spanish as chunga (Table 1) the palm is the source of fibers used in coiled basketry. Wounaan and Embera also have a number of secondary uses for chunga. Borgtoft Pedersen (1994) described the use of Astrocaryum standleyanum by mestizos in Ec- 1 Received 25 January 2000; accepted 14 July 2000. uador for both the export of raw fibers and for a domestic industry of hats, hammocks, mats, and furniture. In eastern Panama, the commer- cial use of chunga fibers is almost wholly re- stricted to basketry. The means of harvesting and processing also is distinct from that in Ec- uador. Chunga basketry is an important tradi- tional practice of Wounaan and Embera and it has become a valuable source of income over the last fifteen years. Here I report on the har- vesting, processing, products, and management of A. standleyanum in Panama.

SPECIES DESCRIPTION AND DISTRIBUTION Astrocaryum standleyanum is a solitary, sub- canopy palm reaching 15 m in height (Fig. 1). The palm is heavily armed, most notably on the stem, which has flattened spines that may reach 20 cm in length. The pinnate leaves may reach 4 m in length with irregularly arranged pinnae that lie in different planes. As with other mem- bers of the genus, the adaxial side of each pinna is glaucous. Flowering peaks during the rainy 4i , S~~~~.~. ' Fig. 1. Astrocaryum standleyanum. Note spines on stem. season (De Steven et al. 1987; Usma, Gallego, and Delgadillo 1996). Infructescences are pen- dulous with 3-5 cm long ovoid fruits that are deep orange at maturity. A number of animals and birds disperse the seeds (Gallego 1995; Hoch and Adler 1997; Smythe 1989). Seed ger- mination may be facilitated by scatter hoarding of agoutis (Smythe 1989), squirrels (Glanz et al. 1982; Glanz 1984), and spiny rats (Hoch and Adler 1997). Astrocaryum standleyanum is distributed from Costa Rica to Panama and along the Pacific slope of Colombia and Ecuador (Henderson, Galeano, and Bernal 1995). In both Panama and Ecuador chunga is common on terra firme forest of the coastal plain to 500 m in elevation (Borg- toft Pedersen 1994) and in Colombia it also is reported from periodically inundated forest (Galeano and Bernal 1987; Usma, Gallego, and Delgadillo 1996). STUDY AREA AND METHODS From January 1997 to December 1998, as well as short periods in 1999 and 2000, I observed the distribution and local uses of A. stand- leyanum in eastern Panama, mostly in Darien Province (Fig. 2). The Darien Province of Pana- ma is considered part of the Choco bioregion, which extends from eastern Panama into northern Ecuador (Dinerstein et al. 1995). The area is char- acterized by lowland tropical moist forest. In ad- dition to similar biogeography, Panama's Darien and Colombia's Choco are both home to Wou- naan and Emberi. Wounaan and Embera indigenous peoples, were historically considered one group, the Cho- co. In the late 1700s, Wounaan (also known as Waunana, Noanama, Nonama') and Embera (also known as Empera, Epera, or Empena) began moving from Colombia into Panama (Herlihy 1986). The groups speak mutually unintelligible languages (Wounmeu and Embera pedee, re-</page><page sequence="3">74 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 l|||l||@; 'it'... . . ....:.'

Anthropologists consider them to have a similar culture, cosmology, and material cul- ture (Harp, pers. comm.; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1962, 1960; Tayler 1996; Wassen 1935). Ap- proximately 3000 Wounaan and 15 000 Embera live in Panama (Herlihy 1997), mostly in Darien, the country's least populated province with less than two households per square kilometer (Di- reccion de Estadistica y Censo 1991). Information on harvest, processing, and art elaboration was obtained via participant obser- vation and informal interviews in the villages of La Chunga, Puerto Lara, and Mogue, with additional observations from the village of Ar- imae (Fig. 2). La Chunga and Mogue are large- ly composed of Embera, and Puerto Lara and Arimae are largely Wounaan. In each village informal interviews were conducted in Spanish with local assistants who interpreted into Em- bera pedee and Wounmeu as necessary.

Informal interviews also were conducted in Panama City with artisans, vendors, anthropol- ogists, and local experts. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The use of Astrocaryum standleyanum bas- ketry fibers by Wounaan and Embera is not new, but only recently have the fibers been described as from A. standleyanum. In the first half of the century, Nordenskiold in 1927 (in Wassen 1935) and Wassen (1935) both collected coiled baskets among the Wounaan in Colombia and Wassen described the coiled technique, as did Reichel- Dolmatoff (1960). In Panama, however, coiled baskets were not amongst early Smithsonian col- lections of Wounaan and Embera artifacts (Krie- ger 1926). Economic botanist Patifno (1977) rec- ognized that the fibers were extracted from As- trocaryum standleyanum, but only noted their use for hats in Colombian coastal areas. Pefia (1980), in a Wounaan book on basketry, and Forero Pinto (1980) identified the chunga palm as the source of fibers for high quality Wounaan baskets, as did a number of subsequent authors (Bernal 1992; Bustos 1994; Chaves Mendoza 1992; Delgadillo 1996; Gallego Castillo 1995; Proyecto 1992; Palacios Santamaria 1993; Usma Oveido 1996; Warner 1996). With the exception of an unpublished report from Colombia (Gal- lego Castillo 1995), none of these authors de- tailed the harvesting, processing, and production of Astrocaryum standleyanum. HARVESTING Astrocaryum standleyanum is destructively harvested, usually by men, who fell the palm because it is so heavily armed. As with all har- vests, Wounaan and Embera only gather chunga with the waning moon as they believe this en- sures the strength of the fibers (pers. obs.; Gal- lego Castillo 1995; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1960). Large juvenile and adult palms can be utilized, however, harvesters scout out palms with longer pinnae because these will yield longer fibers. In the three towns where harvesters were in- terviewed, the travel time necessary to harvest chunga palms varied (Table 2). The differences in time to find harvestable Astrocaryum stan- dleyanum is a result of forest cover in these sites. Both the villages of La Chunga and Mogue are located in more forested zones of southern Darien Province, whereas Puerto Lara is located relatively close to the Pan-American Highway and is being infringed upon by outsiders. In ad- dition, in Puerto Lara, 75% of artisans purchase recently cut chunga spear leaves because the palm is not available nearby or not available on their land whereas 18% of La Chunga weavers purchase chunga for the convenience of not hav- ing to fell the palm and remove the pinnae from the spear leaf. Artisans obtain basketry fibers only from the palm's newly emerging spear leaf and occasion- ally its first expanded leaf. Once the palm is felled, the spear leaf is removed, and if the first expanded leaf is still young and flexible it may be cut as well. Most weavers reported using only the spear leaf, particularly in areas where exten- sive tracts of forest remain nearby, such as the town of Mogue. The pinnae are removed from the rachis by pulling each towards the base of the leaf and are wrapped in other leaves for pro- tective transport to the house (Fig. 3A). A bun- dle of pinnae from a single spear leaf sells for US$ 1-3.</page><page sequence="5">76 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 bJlZlS~~~~~~~~~~~ Fig. 3. Preparation of chunga fibers. A.

Foreground, light green fibers from first expanded leaf; background, bleached fibers from spear leaf. PROCESSING Women process the chunga fibers. Sitting down, a weaver folds a pinna at the midrib, wraps the distal end of the pinna around her toe, and fully extends the pinna towards her with one hand (Fig. 3B). Then, with her other hand, she makes a clean cut to the proximal end of one side of a pinna and carefully peels away the up- per epidermis and mesophyll along the entire length of the lamina (Fig. 3C). She repeats this for the second side of the pinna. Once the fibers are removed from all of the spear leaf pinnae, she soaks them overnight in soapy water to lighten the color. Then she places them to dry and bleach further in the sun. The pinnae from the expanded leaf are not as flexible and they are more difficult to separate into fiber than the unopened spear leaf. Also, because fibers from the expanded leaf are darker and do not whiten, they are dyed or, rarely, used as light green fibers (Fig. 3D). Each fiber is the approximate width and length of a pinna and is divided into several thinner, weaving strands. A woman wraps a fiber around her toe and fully extends it towards her with one hand. With her other hand she uses a knife, needle, or fingernail to cut through the fiber and divides it along its length. She does this three to five times, dividing a single fiber into thinner, weaving strands. Some weavers prefer to divide the fiber when recently cut, rath- er than when dried, because the resulting weav- ing strands are less frayed. A weaver twists the strands so they are thinner and the frays do not show. The fibers of Astrocaryum chambira Bur- ret are prepared in a similar manner in Amazon- ia (Holm Jensen and Balslev 1995; Wheeler 1970). Wounaan and Embera possess a palette of nat- ural dyes (Table 3). Dyes are made from plants found in home gardens, swidden forest plots, secondary forest, forest, and nearby private plantations. Knowledge of dye plants differs among households within a community and among communities.</page><page sequence="6">20011 RUNK: USE OF FIBER PALM FOR BASKETRY IN EASTERN PANAMA 77 00 C) CO - - 40.

Artificial dyes also are used, such as mosquito coils, powdered drink mixes (pers. obs), and crepe paper (Binder pers. comm.; Penia 1980). However, artisans try to minimize the use of artificial dyes as they realize that purchasers prefer natural dyes. Wou- naan artisans in Colombia reportedly use only black, red, orange, and yellow natural dyes (Howe pers. comm.; Delgadillo 1996; Gallego Castillo 1995; Usma Oveido 1996). A weaver typically boils dye plants for one to two hours, then strains off the plant pieces. Next she places a wet skein of fibers into a dye pot. The fibers usually are boiled from fifteen min- utes to several hours, depending on the shade. To create certain colors, fibers may be redyed with ash or another dye plant, buried in river sediments, or washed with soap. No mordants are used to fix dye colors. A skein of bleached chunga fiber, the equivalent of a single leaf, sells for US$ 5 and a skein of dyed fibers sells for US$ 8-10. To weave chunga baskets artisans also harvest and prepare the foundation fibers from naguala (Carludovica palmate R. &amp; P.). Harvesting of naguala is done by weavers, as it is easy to har- vest with a machete and commonly grows in secondary forest and along forest trails. The har- vester cuts the emerging leaf from a plant and slices it open laterally. She cuts out the midvein and hangs the remaining leaf to dry and bleach. An artisan is careful that the naguala leaf does not get wet, as the fibers will turn brown. A processed leaf of Carludovica palmata sells for US$ 0.25. BASKETS Baskets are the main product of chunga fibers. To begin a basket, a weaver knots about five naguala fibers. Then she threads a needle with a chunga strand and sews it around the naguala knot. Once a small disk is made, the artisan cir- cles the five to ten fibers of naguala around it and wraps it with chunga, creating small coils. Additional naguala is added as necessary (Fig. 4A). The finest weavers use smaller amounts of naguala and weave each subsequent coil into half of the previous one, so that the weave is smoother (Fig. 4B). This also uses more chunga. Dyed chunga strands are added as necessary in</page><page sequence="7">78 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 IE di _w B C: Fig. 4. Chunga basketry. A. A partially-completed basket with zoomorphic designs.

One weaver estimated that a single, large basket about 25 cm in height used about four chunga leaves. Early ethnographic work among Wounaan in Colombia reported simple, coiled baskets with lids as items of material culture (Reichel-Dol- matoff 1960; Wassen 1935). Although this de- sign persists, woven plates or ovoid baskets are the most common styles (Fig. 4D). Masks and small animal figures also are made, mostly by Embera. Colombian baskets are columnar is shape. Plain baskets without colorful, woven de- signs are extremely rare, although they were available in the early 1970s (Binder pers. comm.). Geometric and anthropomorphic de- signs are found throughout Wounaan and Em- bera material culture and also in traditional body painting with jagua (Genipa americana L.) and achiote (Bixa orellana L.). Zoomorphic designs are recent innovations in weaving, attributed to novel designs by individual artisans that quickly became favorites among vendors and purchas- ers. Vendors and development specialists who work with Wounaan artisans in Colombia report that artisans there do not weave zoomorphic de- signs. Anthropomorphic designs are more com- mon in Colombia. Some artisans weave the same design into the bottom of their baskets as a signature. In Panama, Wounaan are widely considered as the finest indigenous weavers. Wounaan often use a tighter weave and more intricate designs than do Embera weavers. It is interesting to note that Wassen (1935) and Reichel-Dolmatoff (1960) originally collected coiled baskets only from Wounaan. In Panama, Wounaan weavers see chunga baskets as part of their heritage and not that of Embera, regardless of the similarities of their cultures. However, art vendors originally worked almost exclusively with Wounaan, large- ly because Wounaan have had greater contacts with missionaries who promoted their artisanry. Wounaan and Embera also have minor sec- ondary uses for Astrocaryum standleyanum. Spines are scraped from palm stems and the stems are used for house posts (Duke 1970; For- ero Pinto 1980; Patino 1977). The seeds are oc- casionally used to make jewelry (Patinlo 1977) and Duke (1970) reported that the seedlings are edible. Traditionally Wounaan and Embera used the palm wood for bows and arrows (Duke 1970). Strings of chunga fibers were tradition- ally used to tie loincloths (Harp pers. comm.). The strength of chunga is indicated in a myth, reported both from Embera and Wounaan, in which a demon is killed by a rising river when he is secured with a chunga string lasso (field notes 1998; Penla 1980; Wassen 1933). This is likely the source of tying pinnae, both with and without painted balsa figures, around house posts in shamanic rituals. MARKETING AND ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE Wounaan and Embera traditionally have used Astrocaryum standleyanum baskets within their</page><page sequence="8">2001] RUNK: USE OF FIBER PALM FOR BASKETRY IN EASTERN PANAMA 79 households for storing goods, but the market for high-quality artisanal baskets began about 15 years ago. In the three communities interviewed, chunga weavers were found in 95% to 100% of households and artisans began weaving com- mercially within the last 10 years (Table 2). Al- though the age of artisans did not differ between the sites, weavers in Puerto Lara have been prac- ticing their art longer than in the other towns. This may be because Puerto Lara is largely a Wounaan community and Wounaan have a lon- ger history of basketry, or it may be a result of the village's proximity to the Pan-American Highway and thus markets in Panama City. Al- though a number of master weavers are located in Panama City, most weavers remain in Darien communities, especially near the border with Colombia. A weaver may earn anywhere from US$ 15 to US$ 500 a month for basketry in an area where fulltime wage labor yields US$ 150 per month. Although the lower end of this range may not appear to be much income, art sales represent a significant source of cash income. In the three communities where artisans were in- terviewed, residents reported that art from non- timber forest products, including chunga bas- kets, represented approximately half of the household income (Table 2). Wounaan and Em- bera' women traditionally have worked outside the cash economy and cash from art sales thus represents a significant new source of revenue, a statement repeated by many women weavers. An indicator of the importance of chunga to the household economy is that men have begun to weave baskets as well. Several men indicated that they know how to weave, but that the work was too tedious. The domestic market for chunga baskets is al- most entirely in Panama City. Artisans, their family members, or friends often travel to Pan- ama City from Darien to sell baskets. However, in the last five years, the market has grown sub- stantially in size and level of competition so that vendors now travel to Darien communities to purchase baskets directly from artisans. A typi- cal domestic vendor will mark up a basket by 50%. Some vendors, particularly those who sell various arts and crafts, reported that their profit margin on baskets was too low and stopped sell- ing them. Most of the finest baskets are now purchased on an advance system, in which ven- dors give a weaver a partial payment for an ini- tiated basket. This means that the finest baskets are not often for sale in the country, as inter- national vendors have the cash on hand to secure a partially completed basket with a down pay- ment and pay higher prices. The majority of baskets entering the interna- tional market appear to be sold in the United States. An international vendor marks up a bas- ket about 100%. Many vendors supply to the market in the southwestern United States, where basket collectors search for baskets made by U.S. Native Americans. A vendor and several purchasers suggested that Wounaan and Embera geometric baskets might be sold in the U.S. as the work of U.S. Native Americans, earning vendors greater profit since U.S. Native Ameri- can baskets retail at a higher price than Wounaan baskets. Regardless, the international vendors that purchase baskets in Panama City typically are not the final seller, but rather, sell to a retailer who makes the final sale. This means a basket sold on the U.S. market often is marked up 200% or more from the price of the artisan. In 1998, vendors of Panama's chunga baskets believed that a market for fine basketry would always exist, particularly given the number of basket collectors. However, they worried about the market impacts of fading of the dyed fibers and increasing basket production by the Wou- naan population in Colombia. Furthermore, much of Panama's domestic market had been to U.S. military personnel stationed in Panama and their families and friends, and the departure of all U.S. troops by late 1999 may have had a negative impact on the market. By August of 1999, domestic vendors had already noted de- clining sales due to the departure of many U.S. troops. The Panamanian government has initi- ated a large tourism campaign to mitigate the loss of tourism spending by the departure of U.S. military personnel. EXTRACTION AND CONSERVATION Exploitation of Astrocaryum standleyanum in eastern Panama is based on naturally growing populations. Although chunga can be found readily in the protected forests of the canal area near Panama' City, it is noticeably scarcer in the forests of Darien. This is likely a result of de- structively harvesting palms for baskets and, perhaps, hunting pressure on animals that facil- itate seed germination by scatter hoarding seeds. In the town of Puerto Lara, chunga has been</page><page sequence="9">80 ECONOMIC BOTANY [VOL. 55 locally extirpated and weavers there must pur- chase the recently cut spear leaves from nonin- digenous vendors. A similar pattern of palm ex- tirpation was noted in Botswana with the change from subsistence to commercial exploitation of Hyphaene petersiana spear leaves (Cunningham and Milton 1987). It also is important to note that destructive harvest of chunga was likely sustainable not only at low use levels, but also when Eastern Panama' was more heavily forest- ed. The extension of the Pan American Highway to the region in the 1980s has altered the re- gion's land tenure and resource use. During a typical day, 450 baskets were seen for sale in Panama City. If each basket is made from a conservative average of three leaves and if one palm is destructively harvested for each leaf, this quantity of baskets represents 1350 harvested chunga palms. Assuming that basket inventory turns over every month on average and the quantity remains constant, then approx- imately 16 200 Astrocaryum standleyanum palms are being felled each year for the basket industry. This is a conservative estimate since not every store or individual that sells baskets was visited in the one-day survey. At the same time, the time it takes for inventory to turn over is not known, although vendors report that bas- kets are sold quickly. Astrocaryum standleyanum can be used as a sustainable extracted resource. In Ecuador, Borgtoft Pedersen (1994) found that extractors use a chisel mounted on a bamboo pole to har- vest the spear leaf of chunga for crafts. In Pan- ama's central province of Cocle, where chunga is used in weaving hats (Cordero 1999; Santana 1998), harvesters do not fell the palm, but rather, scrape the spines from the stem and nail small planks into the trunk to repeatedly climb the tree (Santana pers. comm.). In South America, the spear leaves of Astrocaryum chambira are re- peatedly cut with the use of bamboo poles (Holm Jensen and Balslev 1995) or another tree is leaned up against the palm to reach the spear leaf (Vormisto pers. comm.). In Colombia, a joint project of Fundacion Fondo de Educaci6n Superior and Artesanias de Colombia promoted the use of a simple half-moon blade mounted on a pole to cut the leaves of Astrocaryum stan- dleyanum without felling the palm (Bernal, pers. com.). To sustainably harvest Astrocaryum standley- anum, harvesters would need to maintain some of the annual leaf production. In Ecuador, col- lectors harvest every second new leaf, yielding an annual harvest of four leaves, which report- edly does not harm leaf production (Borgtoft Pedersen 1994). Other studies have found that A. standleyanum produces four (De Steven et al. 1987) to six (Usma Oveido 1996) new leaves annually in central Panama and Colombian Cho- co, respectively. For eastern Panama, therefore, a harvest of one to two leaves annually per palm might be sustainable. In conjunction with continued harvesting of palms, enrichment planting of palms may be useful given the heavy demand for fiber. In cen- tral Panama, Smythe (1989) found that germi- nation of buried A. standleyanum seeds was much higher than unburied seeds. However, in Darien, as in Ecuador (Bortoft Pedersen 1994), chunga seedlings were abundant in the forest. In the town of Puerto Lara, chunga artisans took the initiative to add Astrocaryum standleyanum palms to artisanal gardens of two other nontim- ber forest product plants, the tagua palm (Phy- telephas seemannii) and the legume tree coco- bolo (Dalbergia retusa). The women believed that they could better care for the palms in an artisanal garden, especially given their worry about injury from the spines. Their interest in transplanting chunga encouraged the dissemi- nation of a brochure on palm transplanting tech- niques (in Spanish, Wounmeu, and Embera pe- dee) by a local project, Proyecto Manejo de Ca- tivales y Productos No Maderables. The Puerto Lara garden will allow artisans to gauge how many years A. standleyanum requires before it is harvestable. Panama's National Environmen- tal Authority has expressed interest in establish- ing germination beds from which to distribute seedlings, both free and at cost, as a means to sustain the chunga industry. CONCLUSION The fiber palm Astrocaryum standleyanum has traditionally been used by Wounaan and Em- bera' for basketry. However it is only within the last 15 years that chunga baskets have become commercial art items. During this time, Pana- ma's Wounaan and Embera artisans have devel- oped a number of natural dyes for fibers, as well as new design motifs of baskets. The sale of baskets is an important source of cash for house- hold economies. However, the chunga basket in- dustry is threatened by the destructive harvest-</page><page sequence="10">2001] RUNK: USE OF FIBER PALM FOR BASKETRY IN EASTERN PANAMA 81 ing of A. standleyanum. Sustainable harvesting of spear leaves and, perhaps, enrichment plant- ing of palms need to be addressed to assure the continued success of the industry. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I appreciated the helpful support of the indigenous leadership of the Congreso General de Tierras Colectivas Embera-Wounaan and Congreso General Embera-Wounaan. I am indebted to the chunga harvesters and artisans of Dari6n and Panama provinces, especially those from the com- munities of La Chunga, Puerto Lara, Mogue, and Arimae, for sharing their knowledge and art with me. I also thank vendors and purchasers for their time explaining their involvement with chunga baskets. I am grateful for the assistance and interpretation of Floriselda Pefia, Sergio Achito, and Pinel Mepaquito. Thanks also to Carmen Galdames for plant identifications. Bill Harp and Ron Binder generously provided their un- published ethnographic observations and Jorge Ceballos kindly provided the unpublished reports from the Fundaci6n FES-Artesanfas de Colombia research. Cyber-Tech S.A. graciously gave me the map to illustrate this paper. Thanks also to Jim Dalling, Andrew Henderson, Charles Peters, John Tuxill, and two anonymous reviewers for their comments on the manuscript. I appreciated the help of Maria Runk and Andrew Mathews in editing the Spanish abstract. Initial research was carried out with the support of Proyecto Manejo de Cativales y Productos No Maderables con Comunidades Campesinos e Indigenas de Dari6n, a joint project of Pan- ama's National Environmental Authority and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute funded by the Intemational Tropical Timber Organi- zation. Subsequent research was carried out with a short-term fellowship from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute. LITERATURE CITED Bernal, R. G. 1992. Colombian palm products. Pages 158-172 in M.
