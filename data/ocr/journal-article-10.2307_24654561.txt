<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mourning Work and Play REBECCA COMAY University of Toronto "Dying, it's to be a mask" The so-called "Theses on the Philosophy of History" announce the double bind, really a double impossibility, inherent in any injunction to remember. On the one hand: any attempt to resuscitate, revive, or retrieve the past is susceptible to the empathie historicism which seeks legitimation in what it renders present. "Peu de gens devineront combien il a fallu être triste pour ressusciter Carthage. . . Underlying the triumphant zeal to resurrection ("the truth won't run away from us" [#5]) is the "despairing" (#7) conformism—Nietzschean pity—which consecrates the present as the ulti mate term and standard of thought as such. On the other hand: to interpret the irretrievability of the past as a simple immutability or completion (some thing to be jettisoned, therefore, as expendable) is equally to yield to the "whorish" (#16) seductions of the Es war einmal, historicism's best "narco tic" (V.578). Thus, simultaneously: (1) don't remember, (2) don't forget. This double prohibition expresses the impossibility either of reanimating or of neutralizing the past, whether as the site of hermeneutic fusion or as the inert object of contemplative detachment (that is, whether to be relived or to be safely buried). A form of memory emerges which neither recuperates nor cuts its losses, whether by spiritualizing or by letting bygones be bygones. Strictly speaking such a memory exceeds the very alternative of memory and forgetting insofar as it manages neither to resuscitate nor to lay to rest the past. "Historical materialism," in Benjamin's sense, displaces the antithesis between idealization and foreclosure—the double aestheticization of loss, whether as indirect gain or as simple absence—thereby disturbing every 105</page><page sequence="2">106 REBECCA COMAY economy of retention or inclusion, but so too equally, by the same token, its simple obverse. The very irrecuperability of the past precludes its ratification as a transcendent Jenseits. Historical materialism directs itself towards a past which is at once irretrievable and (indeed, for this very reason) incomplete. In other words: the dead are irremediably and yet not securely so. If, for the victims, remembrance necessarily comes too late to make good the losses, they are not for this reason immune or exempt from further risk. If the storm of progress prevents the angel from "lingering, awakening the dead, making whole what has been smashed" (#9), it is equally true that "not even the dead will be safe from the enemy if he wins" (#6). Benjamin adds that the enemy "has not ceased to be victorious" (#6). Neither resurrection nor proper burial, neither a spiritualization of death nor its securing as life's antithesis can now be thought. Death therefore neither terminates nor is redeemed by the life which it not only ends or "finishes" but in fact marks as radically "finite" and, as such, unfinished. Death's finality provides neither the stabil ity nor the consolation of eternal rest. The very possibility of death therefore marks its essential impossibility as closure or completion: in its irrécupérable pastness death is always already marked as partial, incomplete, unfinished. To die is essentially to fail to die, insofar as death's own finitude (the inherent finitude of finitude) implies its repetition in the perpetual purgatory of an afterlife (Uberleben) (IV. 1.1 Of.; ILL 71) marked by "over-ripeness [Uberreife] and decay" (1.1.355; OGT 179). History is just this purgatory. Every victim stands to suffer, not once, but the repeated torture of an injustice multiplied in being denied. Thus the dead, beyond awakening, nonetheless stand to die a second death in being forgotten. What has been improperly or unsafely buried comes back to haunt the living in the eternity of a recurrence which neither returns nor makes good the loss. Neither securely dead nor spiritually recuperable, the dead exert their uncanny pressure on the living who are in turn reduced to living dead. II Every mourning work would therefore be disrupted. The speculative econ omy of every labour—memory (Er-innerung) as the interiorization, "in psychation" (Einverseelung) (Nietzsche),2 or "intimation" (Derrida)3 of an exterior, restitution of an absence, consolidation of identity through the idealizing identification with or appropriation of the missing Other—the productive determination of loss as the determinate negativity of a "result" or product would be disturbed or rendered futile. It matters little for these purposes whether we target Hegel or Freud as our foil or straw man. (Let us for the sake of efficiency assume for now the familiar simplifications.) What would seem to present itself in both of these cases, whether culturally or</page><page sequence="3">MO URNING WORK AND Ρ LA Y 107 intrapsychically, according to a metabolic model of organic assimilation and exchange—whether a dialectical "devouring" of the collective past as "in organic nature"4 or an oral introjection of the idealized love-object5—what, according to such an identificatory model, is put to work in the service of the subject's own self-constitution is here, by contrast, rendered unassimilable to the self-identity of the self. Or more precisely: such identity is now exposed as self-contradictory. The impossibility of dying means equally the impossibility of rebirth or restitution, and thus, for the survivors, the impossibility of productive mourning. Melancholic immersion—what Benjamin calls Versunkenheit— deflates or "sinks" the subject's standing to the point where it assumes the tangible exteriority of the "thing" (1.1.334; OGT 157). In this respect Ben jamin's mourning begins to resemble Freud's melancholia. Ill For Freud, of course, melancholia functions as the pathological antithesis or obverse of successful or "normal" mourning. It opposes and even "blocks"6 the ego's pathway to health and "liberty" (GW 10:430; SE 18:245) in that it remains recalcitrant to the reality-principle and its insistence that the "abo lished" (vemichtete) object be relinquished and the corresponding cathexis thus released. Normal mourning extracts a "premium" or reward (Prarnie) for such a renunciation, compensates the survivor with the narcissistic satis faction of continued life (GW 10:445; SE 18:257). In other words: the com pensation for survival is precisely . . . survival. Melancholia refuses the tautology implicit in such compensation. It "overcomes" (iiberwindet) (GW 10:431; SE 18:246) the life-affirming tendency which would itself "overcome" (iiberwinden) (GW 10:442; SE 18:255) loss by moving on. It overcomes that overcoming (the Nietzschean resonance here is unavoidable) precisely because it refuses to determine or assess the inflicted loss. The loss remains irredeem able because "unknown" (GW 10:431; SE 18:245), incalculable, indetermin able within the calculus of the ego with its realist predilection for fixed identities and its rational economics of final gain. "Unknown loss" dissolves or erodes the very principle of subjectivity. The I becomes evacuated, "poor and empty" (GW 10:431; SE 18:246), self forsaken (verlassen) (SE 18:249), obsessing endlessly about its dwindling finances (Verarmung) (GW 10:434; SE 18:248)—a feature "torn out of context and transformed" from anal eroticism (GW 10:439; SE 18:252)—as if to register the utter impoverishment (Verarmung) at its core (GW 10:440; SE 18:253). Ambivalence renders the missing object undecidable (unidentifiable and as such irreplaceable): the adaptive process of libidinal transfer or displacement is interrupted. The "shadow" of the "forsaken" (verlassen)</page><page sequence="4">108 REBECCA CO MAY object henceforth "falls upon the ego" (GW 10:435; SE 18:249) which, under the impact of regression to the cannibalistic orality of early narcissism, turns its sadistic impulses towards the object upon itself. Sleepless, anorexic, the melancholic simultaneously confirms and overturns the infantile regime of need gratification, turning life-instincts against themselves in exposing the destructive kernel of all desire. To eat, as Hegel reminds us, is to negate the desired object: in "refusing nourishment" (GW 10:436; SE 18:250) the melancholic at once prolongs and dissimulates his sadistic fantasies towards the other insofar as he is now consumed by his own aggressions. Thus melancholia functions as an "open wound" (GW 10:439; SE 18:253) or "painful wound" (GW 10:446; SE 18:258)—the "festering wound" that, according to Nietzsche, characterizes the resentful hypermnesia of the ill or impotent ("one cannot get rid of anything, one cannot get over anything, one cannot repel anything—everything hurts"),7 manifested in the insomniac dyspepsia symptomatic of all asceticism. IV The complications of this story are by now familiar and can be quickly summarized. What presents itself in "Mourning and Melancholia" as a pathological deviation from the "prototype" (GW 10:428; SE 18:243) of successful mourning will soon enough (if indeed it has not already from the outset) appear to be both more "frequent" and more "typical"8 than the presumed norm. Due to the ambivalent nature of every object relation, melancholia threatens to erode every gratification offered as the compensa tory "premium" for survival. By the time of the Ego and the Id (1923), cannibalism appears to be an entirely "normal" and effective response to loss insofar as it is indispensable to the task of ego-formation. Identity presupposes the identification with the lost object who is internalized in idealized guise. But since every such idealization also conceals a secret hatred for its object, the very process of interiorization simultaneously negates, disfigures and indeed excludes what it would take in. Whether the internalized object functions as punitive agency or as abject victim—that is, whether the destructive identification effects a modification within the super-ego (Ego and Id) or within the ego proper (Group Psychology) (Freud's waverings suggest both possibilities) — the fact remains that the act of identification is tinged by a distortion threatening the very self-identity which is at stake. Every successful (Oedipal) introjec tion assumes the implicit fantasy of a prior (oral) incorporation of the maternal body—an incorporation which, as described by Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok, fails entirely to interiorize or comprehend, and thus eventually replace, what it has lost.9</page><page sequence="5">MOURNING WORK AND PLAY 109 Incorporation marks the limits of digestibility. The ingested object re mains unassimilable, uncontained, and therefore irreplaceable, sealed off or "encrypted" as an internal outsider or (to invoke Derrida's superbly efficient elaboration) fors.10 The crypt—as forum, fort, or tribunal {for), outside {forts) or excluded from the interiority to which it nonetheless apparently and essentially contributes—secretly inters (but thereby isolates and per petuates) the missing object as living dead. Buried alive within the interior fortress of a subjectivity fractured by the persistence of what cannot be discharged, absorbed, or otherwise metabolized, the lost object asserts its continued claim on those still alive. Melancholia articulates this claim. V It is not my purpose here to trace the twists and turns of Benjamin's rather ambivalent, if not indeed properly melancholic, relationship to Freud, whose text, incorporated or otherwise, in any case remains elusive but ineluctable within the fragmented remains of Benjamin's own corpus. Nor exactly do I need to underline the obvious: "Trauer" and "Melancholie" are used more or less interchangeably by Benjamin from the beginning. "Mourning and Melancholia" itself (the text) appears not to have been read. An investigation of the dossier would nonetheless no doubt yield an almost clinical picture of Freudian melancholia, no less striking for going unnamed as such. I am referring to the motifs of cannibalism, for example (I am thinking in particu lar of the Kraus essay),11 or ventriloquistic murder (similarly), or insomnia (see the remarks on Breton, Proust, Kafka, Kraus), fasting (Kafka), or poverty (see in particular "Erfahrung und Armut"), or to the theme of the complaint {Anklage) secretly animating every plaint {Klage) (the Kraus essay yet once again, more or less resuming Freud's earlier pun, which in turn of course recalls Nietzsche's own in Zarathustra) .'2 But I am referring equally to the persistent, if variegated, motif of the cadavre exquis as living corpse.13 Consider, for example, the dead bodies presented on the Baroque theatre stage, the walking statues of Baudelaire, the living dolls fossilized within the plush "casing" of the bourgeois intérieur, Poe's puppet-pedestrians, the gam blers, drunks, and factory-workers jerked along like automata through the hell of habit, or finally, the ghostlike victims of photography, already posthu mized in their own lifetime. And so on. If I refrain here from elaborating such a symptomatology in any detail (I have elsewhere pursued this in a different context)14 it is not simply to avoid tedium or psychologism or to evade the inevitable complications (most notably those posed by sexual difference), but in order to pursue the more originary question, so to speak, of loss as such. What is at stake is the movement from Trauerarbeit, as the productive putting-to-work of death within the restricted economy or teleology of life, to</page><page sequence="6">110 REBECCA CO MAY the "lugubrious game" of a melancholia destined to repeat itself without nostalgia or, therefore, hope of gain. If I invoke Bataille here, as I have already from the start been invoking Nietzsche, it is less that I am convinced of an ultimate kinship or affinity—Benjamin's own hesitations should at least be taken seriously—than that, at least formally, the economic considerations appear to coincide. Such a movement traces the limits of every labor. VI Melancholia simultaneously intensifies and displaces the work of mourning by declaring loss to be insurmountable, unworkable within any system of exchange or restitution, presentable only as the infinite ostentation— "insistent communicativeness" (aufdringliche Mitteilsamkeit)—of a subject whose only satisfaction now lies in "sheer exposure" (Blossstellung).15 In Beyond the Pleasure Principle Freud indicates the dramaturgical peculiarities of such exposure. The forlorn child dramatizes his mother's absence as the endless mise-en-scène of a Fort-Da play in which, as Freud himself points out, the "first act"—the child's "meaningful [bedeutungsvolles] 'o-o-o-o,'" fort, Fortsein, Fortgehen, "away," "gone," disappearance—is effectively all that is staged.16 A radical asymmetry disrupts the formal and phonemic binarity governing the Fort-Da sequence in its totality. The diacritical regulation of semiotic arbitrariness is thus deregulated.17 The child evidently flings away the bobbin with more persistence than when he retrieves it.18 Leaving aside for now the very practical and far from irrelevant question as to how exactly the child manages to stage (or how the spectator manages to view) dis appearance as a "game in itself" or self-contained spectacle—given that the bobbin has to be reeled in if only in order to be released again—the theatrical implications are in any case suggestive. Despite the "greater pleasure" associated "without a doubt" with the object's return from behind the "curtain" screening off the crib from its surroundings, the child evidently rehearses the first act—essentially an exit-scene—"far more frequently" than its consoling sequel. Under the impact of the repetition compulsion, the "first act" shifts from being a "preliminary" (Vorbedingung)—a mere prelude to the "pleasurable ending" constituted by the object's return or restitution—to being indeed the entire spectacle. The Aristotelian demand for dramatic closure is thus perverted. The beginning preempts the end—both simulates and inverts it—insofar as the initial scene is comprised in its entirety of a dramatic exit. In "skillfully" (mit Geschick)— in accordance with a certain destiny—throwing the spool behind the curtain, the child opens the play precisely by closing it off to future closure, dramatizes an end before the end and thus deflects all possible conclusion. The stage is thus effectively constituted as an empty one. The</page><page sequence="7">MOURNING WORK AND PLAY 111 pleasure principle's natural interest in reparation—an interest expressed aesthetically in the cathartic tendency to "rework" (bearbeiten) pain anamnes tically by representing it19—the interest in the disinterested contemplation of the beautiful (Kant and Freud should be read together here) is thus frustrated. The conciliatory harmonies of every Spieltrieb are repudiated. The dejected child refuses the consoling symmetries of the "complete game" of "disappearance-and-return," rejects every illusion of return as ideology, insists on dissonance or dissymmetry as the only adequate aesthetic response to originary loss. His truncated cry and motion have the gestic incompletion of a Brechtian Lehrstuck. His open mouth ("o-o-o-o") registers the abyss of the irreparable. The mouth bites what can be neither consumed nor expelled as such. Thus the dead [morts] become a bit or morsel [mors] in the mouth of the living, who themselves are morcellized or mortified beyond repair. "Mid-mourning" (Derrida) marks that mouthful.20 VII Perhaps the open-mouthed horror of the Angelus Novus. Medusa-faced, turned to stone before the frozen landscape (1.1.343; OGT 166) of a world turned to rubble, mortified by the very effort to revive the dead. "His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread . . ." (#9). VIII The bobbin returns without returning, comes back only so as to register the im possibility of all restitution and as such the radical Unheimlichkrit of every home. Kafka has named this bobbin. Odradek (a name of unknown origin, neither Czech nor German, unintelligible) is the strange creature (Gebilde) lurking in the recesses and liminal interstices of the domestic interior, a "star-shaped bobbin" continually reappearing in "attic, stairwell, corri dor and hall." Like a ghost or double (or like one of those little children's toys you keep tripping over on your way out of the house), it—or "he" (the object is personified approximately halfway through the narrative) — "always keeps on coming back to our house."21 This despite or because of the fact that it lacks any secure tether to guide or guarantee a safe return to the parental oikos. Its motley colored threads "trail behind" it, frayed and tangled, "broken off." The Hausvater fails to appropriate or assimilate the returning object within the patrimony of the household economy: "Odradek is extraordinarily nimble [beweglich] and can never be laid hold of [nicht zu fangen irf]." Although its bizarre shape suggests a determinate lack or fall from a prior</page><page sequence="8">112 REBECCA COMAY plenitude or Zweckmassigkeit ("one is tempted to believe that the creature once had some sort of purposive form [zweckmassige Form] and is now only a broken-down remnant"), its surface reveals no seam or rupture by which to assess the measure of any loss. "Nowhere is there an unfinished or broken surface. . . . the whole thing looks senseless enough but in its own way perfectly finished." If anything, the object's oddity stems less from a lack or deficiency than from the curious excess resulting from the supplementary prostheses appended at a double perpendicular to the "center" of its body, the two "small rods" which permit it to assume the anthropomorphic posi tion of an object "standing] upright, as if on two legs." The erect posture thus arises as a surplus masquerading as a privation or deficiency. Odradek (henceforth in the narrative, "he") is in this sense the simulacrum of a humanity no longer dignified by the autotelic sufficiency of Kantian purpo siveness or assured its moral destiny and elevation before the law. Personified, "he" both mimes and mocks the sufficiencies of human reason. Endowed with speech and with the essential attributes of the living, he nonetheless frustrates every hermeneutic attempt at dialogue, resists the idealization implicit in every act of prosopopoeia precisely by refusing to answer back. "Many a time when you go out of the door and he happens just to be leaning directly beneath you below the banisters you feel inclined to speak to him," but he deflects even the easiest questions with his peculiar laugh. '"Well, what's your name?' you ask him. 'Odradek,' he says. 'And where do you live?' 'No fixed abode,' he says and laughs; but it is only the kind of laughter that has no lungs behind it"—a laughter without breath or voice or spirituality—"like the rustling of fallen leaves." "And that," re marks Kafka, "is usually the end of the conversation." He then adds that "even these answers are not always forthcoming. Often [Odradek] stays mute for a long time, as wooden as his appearance." Odradek's personifica tion or prosopopoeia is thus rigorously allegorical—nonsymbolic, nonidealis tic, and nonhumanistic—insofar as it subverts the spiritual reciprocities assumed by every hermeneutic of Einfiihlung, indicates the limits of all resuscitation or animation, and thus the infinite persistence of the "world of things."22 Odradek is addressed, given speech only so as to assume a voice less voice bereft of breath or life or spiritus, animated only so as to approxi mate the whisper of dead leaves. Or, perhaps: the whisper of fallen pages [gefallenen Blàttern]. The returning Other thus receives a prosopon or "face" which resembles a death mask in its wooden reticence, acquires a voice which resembles writing in its papery eloquence, is brought (back) to a life devoid of sense. Despite being addressed, "he" acquires no fixed address or spiritual destination, returning to a house which remains indeterminate and undeterminable: "no fixed abode [unbestimmter Wohnsitz]·" Because such a creature appears to lack the natural purposiveness and</page><page sequence="9">MOURNING WORK AND PLAY 113 "activity" [Tàtigkeit] of the living—lacks even the lack or lacuna, Bruchstelle, which would indicate the original presence of a goal—Kaika's narrator asks ("in vain" or "to no purpose") whether it (or "he") might not equally lack the possibility of dying. "I ask myself, to no purpose, what is likely to happen to him. Can he possibly die? Anything that dies has had some kind of aim in life, some kind of activity, which has worn out, but that does not apply to Odradek." The impossibility of living implies essentially the impossibility of dying and thus the fatality of a recurrence without the consolation of resur rection or eternal life. The bobbin is to keep on coming back, rolling down the stairs dragging its tattered threads behind it, a Sisyphean burden for those who inherit the paternal home. Kafka's narrator continues: Am I to suppose, then, that he will always be rolling down the stairs, with ends of thread trailing after him, right before the feet of my children and my children's children? He does no harm to anyone that one can see; but the idea that he is likely to survive me [mich noch iiberleben] I find almost painful. The open mouth thus calls upon the dead. "O-o-o-o" is the "O" of an impossible apostrophe to the absent other, a broken vocative (" "), pure vocalization, at the very limits of the breath. Apostrophe (like the more general trope of prosopopoeia which subsumes it) is the idealizing trope par excellence—as such most suited to the work of mourning—insofar as it assumes, commands and ultimately promises to (retroactively) effect nothing less than the animation of the inanimate.23 I invoke the Other—dead, absent, inanimate, inhuman, or at the very least, momentarily or potentially speechless (that means, obviously, everyone, always)—and thereby consti tute or (re-) create it as another self. The Other acquires voice, consciousness, the anthropomorphic features of my own self-identity—in short, a "face," persona, prosopon, a theatrical mask or countenance—corresponding to my own dramatic, if not indeed melodramatic, sense of my own power. I invoke the Other so as to provoke a response from it, thus confirming, as Culler astutely argues, my own vocation and privilege as lyric "poet." In speaking to the dead or mute or inanimate, I grant myself nothing less than the power of transubstantiation, as the one to whom a hitherto silent Nature speaks. I breathe life into the inanimate and thus am inspired by what I inspire. In this way the gift returns to its origin. In speaking, I endow the dead with speech and thus confirm the creative potency of my own words. The circle closes. Breath, voice, personality: everything reverts to the source and re circulates within the restricted economy of a language seeking return in what it puts out. My address marks my own rebirth or revival as speaking subject.</page><page sequence="10">114 REBECCA CO MAY But the very return to sender at the same time exposes the original address as, in fact, an error. In reverting to me, my speech acquires the frozen inefficacy of a dead letter. The figurality of the address outstrips and occludes the actual address or destination, and thus my creative destiny is blocked by the very act which was to confirm it. My "O" becomes the empty cipher of a futile invocation which appeals ultimately only to the conventionality of received speech. Pure voice—"O" — thus collapses into the seriality of writing. Undifferentiated immediacy collapses into the endless mediacy of a subject forever feeding on, swallowing back, and ultimately choking on its own words. Every apostrophe in the end involves the contradiction of a speech act premised on a possibility which its very form precludes: the access to the Other is infinitely deferred by the figurality on which the speaking subject's mediated return-to-self relies. My act of speech assumes the possi bility of dialogical return, response, rejoinder, and thus hints of a reconcilia tion the possibility of which is undermined by the very fact of the address. In invoking the absent other as interlocutor I necessarily compound the very absence my speech would heal. The attempt at restitution necessarily cir cumvents itself in that the materiality of language impedes all sublation within the intersubjective totality of Geist. XI Hegel attributed to language a "divine nature" of "reversal" [verkehren] (PhG 92; PhS 66), exemplified in its universalizing or inclusive tendency to consti tute the "I" collectively as a "We" (PhG 145; PhS 110). In speech I realize my "spiritual" identity with the outside world. I animate what I address insofar as my speech "infects" or "contaminates" (Hegel speaks repeatedly of a "universal contagion" [Ansteckung]), or in other words, mimetically (re-) constitutes the Other, who in hearing or responding is thereby brought to life as my interlocutor. Language is said to be the very "existence of Spirit," in that it exemplifies the logic of determinate negativity—retention-in disappearance—constitutive of thought as such. As "utterance" or (self) externalization (Ausserung, Entàusserung), language essentially illustrates, facili tates, and, indeed makes possible the essential movement from the sensuous to the intelligible on which the entire labor of the negative is based. I open my mouth and am thus divested of my exclusive individuality or self-propriety, which is thereby transferred or "passed over" (ilbergegangen) to those who hear. "This vanishing is thus at once its abiding [Dies Verschwinden ist also selbst unmittelbar sein Bleiben]" (PhG 376; PhS 309). My loss becomes a gain for those I constitute as interlocutors—eventually, the universe itself as interlocutor— which comes to acquire and return back to me my relinquished subjectivity, now infinitely aggrandized because in idealized or conceptualized form.</page><page sequence="11">MOURNING WORK AND PLAY 115 Through language, existence as such takes on the structure of the self. In speaking, I come to "fuse" or "coalesce" [zusammenfliessen] with others in a cathartic and identificatory recognition scene whereby my interlocutor assumes the essential features of my existence (PhG 479; PhS 395). My subjectivity is in this way purified of its contingent particularity so as to achieve the concrete universality of Geist. (This drama of anagnorisis and purgation is in its own way rigorously Aristotelian in its logic.) Without language, the "I, as this pure I, does not exist," or more precisely, "is not there"—ist nicht da (emphasis Hegel's)—acquires no Dasein, no Da, no objective presence (to itself). It in this case would remain "immersed" or "sunk" [ versenkt] in, but equally withdrawn from, a world bereft of soul or life [entseelt] .24 Language is for this reason said to be indeed the very "existence of Spirit," das Dasein des Geistes—the Da or site of Spirit's own self recuperation— "existence which has become a self [zum Selbst gewordene Da sein]" (PhG 479; PhS 395). Language is thus to provide its own antidote to the self-loss which it simultaneously (as "infection") inaugurates. It counters every Fort—"disappearance," Verschwinden—with its consoling Da. Speech, for Hegel, is in this sense nothing other than the infinite pro sopopeia of a subject in perpetual mourning who thus finds eternal consola tion in a world endowed with subjectivity. "Language is the soul existing as soul" (PhG 518; PhS 430). The universal acquires a self—substance becomes subject, an sich becomes fiir sich—and as such redeems my personal loss. Death is put to work or recirculated within a language characterized by infinite "fluidity" (Fliissigkeit)25 (perhaps also in the sense of "liquid" cashflow), converted into disposable reserve. The reconciliation of subject and object is achieved in and by a language determined essentially as communication and according to a sacrificial logic of restitution: I talk myself to death—literally speak my death—in such a way that I survive (iiberleben) my own demise (PhG 375; PhS 308). In short: I address the Other as another self. This transferential economy culminates in a philosophical resurrection scene whereby in collective cere bration I infuse universal substance with self-consciousness. Both Spirit and I die and are reborn simultaneously in a double movement of loss and reparation in which an incarnate God dies, resurrects, and ascends to dis seminate its substance in the universal Pentecost of thought. The partial or one-sided (because abstractly individuated) prosopopoeias of natural consciousness are fulfilled or completed in absolute knowing. What appears at each immature stage of cognition as a literal projection or anthropomorphization on the part of individual consciousness—whether the creation of the absolute monarchy ("l'état, c'est moi"), for example, or the personification of natural forces in symbolic religion, whether the animation of the human statue in the athletic spectacles of art-religion, or for that</page><page sequence="12">116 REBECCA CO MAY matter, even the resuscitation of the God-man in revealed religion—what appears prior to redemption as a particularized, exclusive and in every way imaginary transfer or exchange of attributes is finally universalized and brought to symbolic closure. The talking heads, walking statues, and living corpses populating the puppet-stage or "picture gallery" (PhG 590; PhS 492) of Spirit's progress are, in the final scene of Hegel's drama of self-recognition, brought home to rest. Such a home would be purified of the uncanniness or Unheimlichkeit which necessarily characterizes every penultimate stage of consciousness. If natural consciousness operates on the mistaken assumptions (all re lated) that life and death, subject and object, man and God are antithetically opposed in their individuated self-identity, the only reconciliation imagin able prior to absolute knowing would be the eeriness of a life-death literalized as spectral return. (The literalization or reanimation of "dead" metaphor is part and parcel of an artificial resuscitation project which, according to Hegel, typically misconstrues, by reifying, its most essential terms.) Prema ture or prephilosophical animation—personification, projection, the arti ficial life-death of a walking abstraction—is inevitably followed by the mortification of a death which similarly fails to "work" insofar as it provides no final rest. Thus the "unrest" which characterizes natural consciousness. "It suffers this violence at its own hands. ... It can find no peace. If it wishes to remain in a state of unthinking inertia, then thought troubles its thought lessness, and its own unrest disturbs its thoughtlessness" (PhG 74f; PhS 51). Prephilosophical consciousness is precisely the parade of shadows, spooks, and statues of a "spirit realm" ( Geisterreich) or ghost world characterized by the terror and violence of a living death. The state which is personified or abstractly spiritualized in the living body of the sun-king is in turn decapitated in a death scene stripped of all spiritual significance or inner "filling"—a death as meaningless or unproductive (strictly speaking, as unnourishing) as "cutting off a head of cabbage or swallowing a mouthful of water" (PhG 436; PhS 360). Only the benighted empiricist, parched in the "desert" of sensuous immediacy (PhG 17; PhS 5), would mistake such a mouthful for the funereal feast of Spirit (PhG 590; PhS 492). The Greek god anthropomorphized as a human statue finds its beauti ful embodiment to be an excess or self-discrepancy, its intact body always already in a state of fragmentation or self-dismemberment, its "members" (Glieder) in their very "beauty and perfection" felt to be nothing but "super fluous appendages," its serenity (Heiterkeit) already burdened by the sorrow (Trauer) which mourns in advance its impending ruin (As 2:85; Aes 484). Prior to redemption, subjectivity is in each case simultaneously proferred and withdrawn in a series of abortive resurrection scenes in which the true rebirth of Spirit in absolute knowing is at once both anticipated and (thus) forestalled.</page><page sequence="13">MOURNING WORK AND PLAY 117 Absolute knowing is the prosopopoeia to end all prosopopoeia. Death as such—"the monstrous power of the negative"—becomes the ultimate inter locutor, personified precisely so as to be mastered by a subject which consoli dates itself by introjecting the "terrifying" power as its own. In a passage which begs to read alongside Kant's analytic of the dynamic sublime (but Milton's allegory of Death in Paradise Lost would no doubt be also pertinent here), Death is endowed with "name," face, subjectivity, addressed in a face-to-face encounter in which the subject overcomes its own fragmentation or Zenssenheit, aggrandizes itself as the power of resistance which draws its very energy from its antagonist, and thereby "magically" recuperates all loss. The activity of dissolution [Scheidens] is the power and work of the under standing, the most astonishing and mightiest of powers, or rather the absolute power . . . the monstrous power of the negative [ungeheuer Macht des Negativen] . . . the energy of thought, of the pure Ί.' Death, if this is what we want to name [nennen] this non-actuality, is of all things the most terrifying and to hold fast what is dead requires the greatest strength. Lacking strength, Beauty hates the Understanding for asking of her what she cannot do. But the life of Spirit is not the life that shrinks from death and keeps itself intact from devastation, but rather the life that endures it and maintains itself in it. It wins its truth only when, in utter dismember ment [Zerissenheit], it finds itself. It is this power, not as something positive, which closes its eyes to (or looks away from [wegsieht]) the negative, as when we say of something that it is nothing or it is false, and then, having done with it, turn away and pass on to something else; on the contrary, Spirit is this power only by looking the negative in the face and lingering with it. This lingering with the negative is the magical power that converts it into being [Dieses Verweilen ist die Zauberkraft, die es in das Sein umkehrt]. (.PhG 36; PhS 18f.) Thus Spirit repairs its narcissistic injuries. To look death in the face is precisely to endow it with face and in this very face-off already to have declared a victory before beginning. "Lingering"—the "slow" digestive process described in the last paragraph of the Phenomenology—would both create and presuppose the magical present of a thought eternally circling back on itself in the "conceptualized history" [begriffene Geschichte] of Spirit's truth {PhG 591; PhS 493). XII It is precisely such consolation which is, of course, at issue. What if the divine tendency of language to "reversal" or "conversion"—verkehren, umkehren— were, more precisely, a tendency to inversion or indeed perversion such that the principle of restitution foundered on the very medium which made it possi ble? What if such reversion culminated in the "absolute perversion" (absolute</page><page sequence="14">118 REBECCA CO MAY Verkehrung) characteristic of a consciousness irreparably split or ruptured (.zerissen) insofar as it is caught in the "self-dissolving play" and "confusion" of an empty garrulity or "shameless" "chatter"?26 If the very "fluidity" of language were as such the occasion of a "sinking" or "immersion"— Versenkung—on the part of an I condemned to a situation of radical heter ogeneity or self-discrepancy—"an imperfect existence in which there is always at once too much as too little," writes Hegel27—and thus to the impossibility of all compensatory exchange? If the "infection" thus out stripped the purification it would seek to render possible according to the homeopathic logic of double negativity? What if the magical power attributed to "lingering" proved rather to be the mythical phantasm of a world in which the "state of emergency" was not the rule but the exception (#8)? If such "lingering" were in fact the luxury of the leisured minority or the curse of the numerous unemployed? "The angel would like to linger \verweileri\, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from paradise. . ." (#9). The mouth would then gape open in an address destined to miss its destination— Ver-kehr thus more or less directly renders the essential devi ancy of apo-strophe as a turning aside, deflection, or diversion, the turning of a turning or trope of a trope, the trope of tropes, the very possibility of every trope—leaving only the endless lamentation of a subject (if it still is one) forever stripped of hope. XIII The open mouth marks the very limits of the beautiful. It defies the pleasure principle—the aesthetic mandate to convert pain into the plastic object of empathie scrutiny—and, by the same token, every economy of return. Laocoôn, caught among the serpents in the infinite bereavement which follows on useless prophesy, is forbidden to open his mouth wide. "Not because crying betrays an ignoble soul," explains Lessing, "but because it distorts the face [das Gesicht verstellen] in a disgusting [ekelhaft] manner."28 Nausea, Ekel, is the sign of a pain unmasterable within the economy of a subject recycling loss within the interiority of consciousness. It simulta neously signals the limits of intersubjectivity in the form of empathy: at the sight of a face distorted by such a grimace, Lessing continues, we as specta tors avert our "faces" or our gaze. The open mouth disturbs the apparent symmetry of every face-to-face encounter, challenges every theater of iden tification, effects a radical "curvature of intersubjective space."29 Only imagine Laocoôn's mouth forced wide open, and judge. Let him scream, and see. [The closed-mouthed statue had been] a form that inspired compassion [Mitleid] because it showed beauty and pain together; now it</page><page sequence="15">MOURNING WORK AND PLAY 119 has become an ugly, repulsive form, from which one gladly turns away one's face [sein Gesicht verwendet]. For the sight of pain excites unpleasure [Unlust\ without this unpleasure being transformed, through the beauty of the suffering being, into the sweet feeling of compassion. The wide opening of the mouth—apart from the fact that the other parts of the face are thereby distorted and twisted in a violent and disgusting fashion—is a blot in painting and a cavity in sculpture which has the most unpleasant possible effect. (Lessing, loc. cit.) XIV The angel's mouth opens as if to address what cannot be spoken of (or to). His gaze refuses to meet our own. In Klee's painting the angel has a divergent squint and unfocussed stare which gazes off the canvas at an angle to the spectator. We watch him watching what cannot be returned to us: the consoling circle snaps. In an unmistakable parody of Hegel's own drama turgy of reconciliation, Benjamin points out the irreconcilable divergence of the positions of viewing subject {fur uns) and object viewed (fiir es). "The angel's face is turned towards the past [Vergangenheit]. Where a chain of events appears before us [vor uns erscheint], there he sees [da sieht er] one single catastrophe, which ceaselessly piles ruins upon ruins and throws them before his feet" ([#9], italics are Benjamin's). Note the contrast between passive and active voices here, as well as the implicit suggestion that in our very haste to construct ladders, chains, or rosaries—as if to reel in the absolute like a missing bobbin—"we" only entangle ourselves within the logic of Vor-stellung. The angel's face is turned towards a Vergangenheit irrécupérable within the essentiality [Wesen\ of what has been completed or accomplished [Gewesenheit]. Such a past exceeds the triangulated intersubjectivity of sub jects recognizing each other in the mutual appropriation of a shared tradi tion, meeting each other's gaze in their simultaneous contemplation of a redeemed past. Just as the angel fails to resurrect the pile of rubble, so too "we" fail to catch his eye. Despite the synthetic power of a vision which evidently finds in the rubble "one single"—or more precisely, "a singular"—"catastrophe [eine einzige Katastrophe]," the angel neither totalizes nor (therefore) communicates his view.30 His gaze remains decentered despite or because of the radical Einzigkeit or singularity of the spectacle confronting him, eyes "wide open"—auf gerissen—perhaps ripped open, both distracted and askew. Hegel, in the Aesthetics, links "goggle-eyes" to the absentminded absorption (geistlose Versenkung) of one who is literally beside oneself (aus sich heraus), lacking inwardness and thus the animating intentionality of the concentrated gaze (At 2:39If.; Aes 734). Distracted by a spectacle which can be neither re deemed nor represented in the dialogical self-proximity of a subject, whether</page><page sequence="16">120 REBECCA CO MAY individual or universal, the angel is beside himself—"ecstatic," then, in every sense. The rubbish heap is untransfigured. The angel's face-to-face encounter with the past fails to spiritualize by animating a world "sunk in rigor mortis" [in Totenstarre versinkt] (1.2.682; CP #34), just as it in turn refuses dialogical appropriation on "our" part as living witnesses or survivors. Seized by the rigidity or petrification—what Benjamin elsewhere names "transfixed rest lessness" [erstarrte Unruhe] (V.410)—which indicates the most catastrophic moment of decision, the angel appears as an angel of death before and to a world already mortified: a memento mori or reminder of a danger no less pressing for having always already transpired. The memory of death is thus at once a future memory and memory of an as yet uncharted future. The present is just the ekstasis constituted by the radical imminence of what is bygone. "Even the dead are not safe from the enemy if he wins" (#6). The dead can die again: every act of resuscitation presupposes and reinforces a prior mortification which only escalates in being reversed. The hermeneutic fan tasy of fusion as an animation or voicing of an otherwise "dead" or mute material—whether Schleiermacher's Einfiihlung, Dilthey's Nacherlebnis, or even, mutatis mutandis (that is, despite every antimimetic, antipsychologis tic, and antirevivalist precaution), Gadamer's conversational model of inter pretation as a "reawakening" of frozen meaning31—the dream of empathy proves to be just the nightmare of a continuum of oppression. Empathie revival only inserts the victim within the "triumphal procession" of the victors, rehabilitates losers as winners according to the slave logic of the qui perd gagne (#7). The dead are brought back to the pantheon of the great men of history—immortal geniuses, "cultural treasures"—given voice only so as to chime in with the conformist melody which integrates whatever it takes in. The very act of resuscitation thus involves a repression of the very difference—difference as such—to which every "victor" by definition is most intolerant: a repression of the very history of repression which in fact constitutes human history to this day. To give voice to the voiceless is thus to redouble silence by submerging dissonance within the infinite tautology of a subject hearing-itself-speak. The dead are thus killed off again in being reanimated, re-silenced in being ventriloquized, reified in the very act of anthropomorphization by which the humanistic tradition ("family of man") constitutes itself as a continuous "chain" or whole. To revive is to remortify, to escalate repression in the very denial of it: a negation of the negation which entirely fails to redeem what it repeats. The angel's apostrophe or "citation" (#14) of the past elicits, in contrast, only the dissonance of a response inaudible within the living present. Any response would expose the angel (and in turn, "us" as spectators) to the very</page><page sequence="17">MOURNING WORK AND PLAY 121 mortification he (and we) would overcome. Or, more precisely: would expose him (and us) as always already mortified. The angel has the bulging eyes and snakelike tresses (compared by some readers to scrolls of writing)32 of a Medusa33 whose averted gaze warns precisely of the impossibility of dialogi cal encounter. But if this Gorgon warns against all specular appropriation, no mirror—not even (or especially not) Athena's mirror—would be sufficient protection from death or reification. Not even the mediated triangularity of a speculative encounter would guarantee immunity on any side. Medusa's frozen death-glare (starren) resists capture within the mirror-house of an Imaginary which posits harmonious integrity ("making whole what has been smashed") in compensation for what cannot ever, since it never in the first place existed, be restored. XV Absolute Spirit reminisced as it surveyed from its "throne" the "slaughter bench" (VPG 35; PhH 21) or Golgotha [Schadelstàtte] (PhG 591; PhS 493) of contingent history. From such a position of "actuality, truth, and certainty," the museal "picture gallery" of the living dead was transformed into the site of a philosophical transubstantiation scene in which Spirit ingested the past as food for thought. The "lifeless solitude" of bereavement was overcome in the communal feast or "Bacchanalian revel" in which the shattered body parts [Glieder] of the dead were re-membered and thus redeemed (PhG 46; PhS 27f.). Absolute Spirit opened its mouth in order to drink from the "chalice" of a spirit-realm which "foamed" forth so as to feed the infinite inwardness of self-thinking thought. Or, according to Hegel's own reworking (by memory) of Schiller's poem "Die Freundschaft" (the title is as significant as Hegel's own emendations): "From the chalice of this realm of spirits / Foams forth to [Spirit] its own infinity." The sacrificial cup overflowed; the victims were recalled so as to confirm the ultimate potency of the system which was to have devoured them; the "friendship" or affinity of "I" and "We" was consecrated in thought. The angel opens his mouth to invoke the dead who only return as vam pires. "Those who are alive at any time . . . are obliged to prepare a banquet for the past. The historian is the herald who invites those who are departed to the table" (V.603; TV 15, 2). Benjamin remarks, regarding the "dietetics" of such a project, that the spectre of the past inspires, for the materialist, not inertia or dejection ( Traungkeit) but a power inspired by the sense as to "just how long his own overwhelming misery has been in preparation." The consumerist sampling of the past as edible material yields only the "curiosité" (V.603; Ν 15, 3)—Heidegger's Neugier, the greed of Nietzsche's "spoiled idler" (cf. #12) — born of an acquiescent despondency before the facts. In</page><page sequence="18">122 REBECCA CO MAY setting the table, the angel in fact turns the table on those who would feast on the dead—or, more precisely, reveals this feast to be quite inedible—insofar as the incorporated victim only ends up devouring in turn the voracious self. The line between inside and outside thus becomes undecidable, as does the temporal or perspectival demarcation between present and past. Rather than taking up the dead as sacrifical victims on the altar of completed history, those in the present are enjoined to an infinite sacrifice to the past. Both the "hatred" and the "spirit of sacrifice" which fuel the class struggle are, according to Benjamin, themselves "nourished [sich nàhren] by the image of enslaved ancestors" (#12). Such an image —"flitting by," "flashing up" (#5), "unexpectedly showing up at a moment of danger" (#6)—offers no consolation or appeasement, such as, for example, that provided by the determinate "ideal of liberated grandchildren [Enkel]" (#12) to whom the angel [Engel] resolutely turns his back. As an image or Bild it remains indeterminable within the conceptual calculus of the subject, and in this sense elicits only the pure expenditure of a sacrifice without return. Else where Benjamin writes of the need to grasp the present "by the horns" if only so as to be able to "pose questions of' (that is, apostrophize and thereby reanimate) a past which would remain otherwise silent or inert. The present thus grasped becomes a sacrificial bull, he continues, "whose blood must fill the pit if the spirits of the departed are to appear at its edge" (III.259). The dead are summoned to a rallying which can no longer serve to legitimate the present. For in its radical self-divestment the latter is always already offering itself as repast to that which it would incorporate and thus necessarily fails to make good on, that is, re-collect, what it recollects. XVI Incipit Trauerspiel. The Reformation—Hegel's "all-enlightening Sun" ( VPG 491; PhH 412)—signalled not only the dawn of Enlightenment (eventually articulated in Kant's "Copernican turn" to subjectivity) but simultaneously its dark antithesis. Luther's renunciation of the venal externality of opera operata expresses not only the optimistic fantasy of human self-sufficiency or Innerlichkeit (Hegel), but equally (Benjamin) the melancholic perception of the world as an "empty" one (1.1.316; OGT139)—a "rubble heap of partial, inauthentic actions" (ibid.). According to Benjamin's own dialectic of the Englightenment, history is thus marked by the "total disappearance of eschatology" (1.1.259; OGT 81) or of immanent redemption, that is, by the loss of any "guaranteed economics of salvation" (1.1.340; OGT 216) which would maximize profit by setting work as such—the very condition of Adam's fallenness—to work. If every Trauerarbeit presupposes the primacy of exchange as the very principle of recuperation—every eschatology relies on</page><page sequence="19">MO URNING WORK AND Ρ LA Y 123 this—the Lutheran renunciation points precisely to the final inefficacy of every labor and thus to the sense of history as a mournful play or play of mourning (the oxymoronic compound is essential [1.1.260; OGT 81]), the staging of unredeemable loss. Secularized as "natural history," history is reduced to a nature which is itself stripped of all organicity or teleological fulfilment—already mortified as "torso," "ruin," "amorphous fragment" (1.1.352; OGT 176)—"seen not in bud and bloom but in the overripeness and decay of her creations" (1.1.355; OGT 179). Naturalized according to this utterly denaturalized or deorganicized model of an original fallen nature, history thus appears spa tialized as a "petrified primordial landscape" (erstarrte Urlandschaft): the "setting" for a Passion play whose importance "resides solely in the stations of its decline" (1.1.343; OGT 166). The "false appearance (falsche Schein] of totality" is thus "extinguished" (1.1.352; OGT 176). The "collapse ofbeauti ful nature" (ibid.) spells the end of the aesthetic "sheen" or "radiance" (iSchein) which forgives or consecrates the given by harmonizing it, and thus the impossibility of any transfiguration ( Verklàrung) (1.1.343; OGT 166) of a deadened life. "There is not the faintest glimmer of any spiritualization of the corporeal" (1.1.363; OGT 187). The lumen naturale of a resplendent physis is replaced by a "subterranean phosphorescence" (Leuchten) (1.1.403; OGT 229). The utter Scheinlosigkeit of an "all-too-earthly" nature-history implies precisely the theatricalization of history as "scene" or "setting" [Schauplatz] (I.1.353f; OGT 177f.) whose only "illumination" is now by the "stage light" [Rampenlicht] of a purely artificial apotheosis (1.1.356; OGT 180). History itself thus appears as a Trauerspiel (1.1.321; OGT 142)—play of mourning, play for the mournful (1.1.299; OGT 119)—in which "the original pain of creation resounds" (1.1.300; OGT 121).34 Such a play escapes the conciliations of every Spieltrieb. The organic harmonies of Kant and Schiller are suspended. The eclipse of aesthetic Schein spells the end of every phenomenological entelechy (i.e., the phainesthai of emergent physis) and thus the advent of a purely simulacral order. The Baroque determination of life as "game" or "puppet-play" (1.1.261; OGT 82) contests the autotelic sufficiency of Kantian purposiveness, together with its correlate, the self-sufficient self. If, under the melancholy gaze of the allegorist, history now appears as "scenic"—thus Benjamin remarks on the Baroque predilection for the "extravagant" (1.1.352; OGT 176) and "obtru sive display of pomp" (1.1.368; OGT 192) — this is by no means the "theatre of world-history" ( VPG 29; PhH 16) in which Absolute Spirit will have consoled itself by aestheticizing (that is, by narrating and thus internalizing) every loss. The lugubrious display of the corpse on the Baroque theatre stage refuses integration into the conceptualized order of plot. Thus the importance, for Benjamin's Baroque, of the dramatic "inter</page><page sequence="20">124 REBECCA CO MAY lude," or Zwischenspiel—Spiel essentially determining itself as "inter-play" — as a result of which "the acts do not follow rapidly from one another but are built up in the manner of terraces" (1.1.369; OGT 192). Dramatic time is spatialized by means of discontinuous interludes of pantomime (typically representing allegorical personifications), compared by Benjamin to "ex pressive statuary," and whose very existence points to the ultimate "connec tion between allegory and spectacle proper [eigentliche Schaustellung]" (1.1.367; OGT 191). Despite its inevitable neo-classical self-misconceptions (1.1.364; OGT 188f.), the Baroque thus resolutely defies the Aristotelian mimeto logical imperative, whereby opsis—"spectacle" ("more the province of the prop-man than of the playwright," remarks Aristotle)35—is marginalized or subordinated to the rationality of muthos. It thus resists the pressure of a pleasure-principle intent on maximizing its effect by emplotting what would otherwise remain unassimilated horror. The mimesis of an otherwise painful reality (Aristotle's example is "lower animals and corpses")36 becomes a source of tragic pleasure precisely in being adapted to a well-ordered story (which itself can therefore be communicated paraphrastically even in the absence of all performance).37 From Aristotle to Hegel the subsumption of Bild to BegriffimpYizs a dramaturgy of reflection or interiorization—a theater therefore overcoming itself as theater—whereby the visible performativity of what is presented is sublated or absorbed in thought. For Benjamin, the Baroque inaugurates the age of the world picture (so to speak) and as such the ultimate return of a repressed or banished opsis. Exhibitionality appears as the essential effect of secularization and thus as the sign, for both a bereaved humanity and a denatured nature, of deepest mourning. The metaphor of world as stage is just the rigorous expression of a world stripped of the consolation of intrinsic meaning and thus subject to the "arbitrary rule" (1.1.407; OGT 233) of the observer. The "connection between mourning and ostentation" (1.1.299; OGT 119)—expressed in the lavish funereal stage props of the Baroque—lies in the link between empti ness and exposure in that the evacuation of spirituality effectively implies a movement of sheer exteriorization without a center. Play becomes the repetitive dis-play of special effects and "heaped up" stereotypes (1.1.354; OGT 178) which thus require interpretation or allegorization to acquire any meaning. The travelling theater of the Baroque—derived from the proces sional trionfi of the Italian Renaissance—exemplifies the tendency to "pure ostentation" whereby a repeatable performance ruptures every unity of time and place. A "ruptured" (gerissen) stage undermines the idea of every "fixed" cosmic coordinate (localized in a cultic site or topos), and similarly of any unique (einmalige) temporal occasion. The Trauerspiel is in its very repetition constituted from the perspective of the onlooker [Beschauer], who thus ex</page><page sequence="21">MO URNING WORK AND PLA Y 125 periences the "obtrusive representation [aufdringliches Vorstellen]" of events stripped of all "relationship to the cosmos" (1.1.299; OGT 119).38 A fallen nature is "prevented by guilt from finding fulfilment of its mean ing in itself" (1.1.398; OGT 224) and thus depends on signification from the outside. Stripped of "cosmic" spirituality, the world is exposed to the "arbit rary rule" of the allegorist (1.1. 407; OGT 233). Under his gloomy gaze a mortified nature acquires a kind of meaning or expressiveness, as if to answer to the most unanswerable sense of loss. But since the allegorist is only "lending" (verleihen) (1.1. 359; OGT 184) a meaning which he is in any case poorly authorized to provide, let alone reclaim with interest, the loan only in fact compounds the guilty muteness it would redeem. Mourning thus be comes the infinite circularity of mortified awakenings and revived mortifica tions: a perpetual "pausing on the threshold of dying and becoming" (II.1.362; R 268). The very vulnerability to interpretion induces in the object only a mournful sense of dependency such that, once allegorized, the object becomes "henceforth" quite "incapable of emanating [ausstrahlen] any sig nificance or meaning of its own" (1.1.359; OGT 184). Allegorization thus "lends" a voice and gaze and vitality which are immediately retracted—or more precisely, the very offer retroactively constitutes its own retraction— in that the endowment effectively robs the recipient of every access to the speech it would impart. In this sense the charge of "extravagance" ( Verschwen dung)—literally, wastefulness—is, as Benjamin comments, entirely "justified" (1.1.360; OGT 184). XVII "Mourning is the state of mind in which feeling revives the empty world in the form of a mask" (1.1.318; OGT 139). Under the "downward gaze" (1.1.330; OGT 152) of melancholy, history acquires a "face" which itself is stripped of all anthropocentric spirituality so as to become a superficies of a radical exteriority or exposure—fades hippocratica. "Everything about history that, from the very beginning, has been untimely, sorrowful, unsuccessful, is expressed in a face—no, in a skull" (1.1.343; OGT 166). "—No": with such a caesura and dénégation, language corrects (but fails inevitably to erase) its inherent, if unappeasable, temptation to idealism. Allegory arrests the idealizing tendency of every trope towards anthromorphism by exposing the essential figurality of language as the simultaneous condition and limit of all reciprocity or communion. Thus prosopopoeia materializes itself by despir itualizing its own effect. The trope of return is (tropically) deflected. The "face of nature" is defaced or disfigured by the "characters of transi ence" which constitute the signature of "history" (1.1.353; OGT 177), which</page><page sequence="22">126 REBECCA CO MAY in turn is subordinated to a "frozen" or inorganic nature. "It is as something incomplete and imperfect that objects stare out [starren\ from the allegorical structure" (1.1.362; OGT 186). The gaze of allegory awakens only a stare which fails to return or make good on what has been invested. The Augenauf schlag or "return of the gaze"39 assumed by every humanism is in this sense both mimed and exposed as already frustrated. Face becomes mask; voice becomes writing which in turn is rendered "ostentatiously" hieroglyphic; dialogue becomes the "accumulation" and "debate" of disjointed and laconic fragments (I.1.382f; OGT 208f.). "Entire speeches sound as if they properly belong beneath an allegorical engraving" (1.1. 372; OGT 196). Dramatic dialogue becomes "no more than a caption" for a "monogram" (1.1.371; OGT 195) of balletic pantomimes or "dumb shows" (stille Vorstellungen) (1.1.369; OGT 192), which, as hieroglyphic, essen tially cannot be "voiced" (lautbar machen) (1.1.376; OGT 201). "Never has poetry been less winged" (1.1.376; OGT 200). Voice now approximates the "awkward heavy-handedness" (1.1.363; OGT 187) of the dead letter. For Benjamin's Baroque, "the spoken word ... is only a commentary on the images, spoken by the images" (1.1.371; OGT 195), and is thus compared to the scrolls of writing "hanging out of the mouths" of figures "in the old paintings" (1.1.373; OGT 197). All speech, at its limit, becomes a kind of electronic writing, an "electric pattern." Or, as the "brilliant" Ritter puts it: "the letter alone speaks" (1.1.388; OGT214). We are very far, as Benjamin reminds us, from the symbolic plenitude expressed in the "Ailes belebt" (ibid.) of every animism, as from the "fashionable tendency to reawaken the primal voice [Urlaut] of all creatures" (1.1.386; OGT 212). In the Baroque, indeed, the very trope of personification is mobilized precisely in a non-anthropocentric fashion so as to underline the mortified materiality of the "figure" which is thus stripped of all interiority or "soul." "Allegorical personification has always concealed the fact that its function is not the personification of things but rather to give the concrete a more imposing form by dressing it up [aufstaffieren] as a person." Benjamin quotes in this respect the "penetrating insight" of a Cysarz: "The Baroque . . . sees everything in terms of figures (not souls) [Figuren (nicht Seelen)]. . . . There is not the faintest glimmer of any spiritualization of the corporeal. The whole of nature is personalized [verpersonlicht], not to be made more inward, but, on the contrary—to be deprived of soul [entseelt]" (1.1.363; OGT 187). Per sonification in this way serves only to expose the "ornamental tendency" (1.1.368; OGT 192)—dress-up, Aufstaffierung—of a language whose very figurality as such becomes a matter of staging and presentation. If, according to at least one allegorical convention, "words, syllables, and letters" (1.1.361; OGT 186) themselves appear as personified characters (so to speak) on stage, this implies neither the vivification of the dead letter nor, therefore, the</page><page sequence="23">MO URN IN G WORK AND PLAY 127 redemptive spiritualization of a deadened life. The apparent animation of dead metaphor (whereby the "sharpness" of jealousy is literalized, for exam ple, by the dagger which thus becomes a dramatic character [1.1.311; OGT 133]) in no way restores to language a prelapsarian plenitude or animistic force. The very majuscules which promise to humanize every object in the universe (by dignifying all nouns with the potential "pomp" of a proper name)40 in fact only "fragment" and "rupture" language (1.1.382; OGT 208) to the point where it assumes the disjecta membra of a corpse (1.1.375; OGT 198). XVIII Allegory, therefore, "goes away empty-handed" (1.1.406; OGT 233). The melancholy gift proves to be a pure expenditure [ Verschwendung\ (1.1.360; OGT 184) without return. If the human body is "no exception" to the generalized "destruction of the organic" (1.1.390; OGT 216), no anthropo morphism could ever turn back or reverse the fragmentation which is at stake. If the "Midas touch" of allegory converts everything into significant material (1.1.403; OGT 229), it for this very reason frustrates every effort to consume the object, which remains now doubly inedible and inert. "Unfaith fulness to man" is in this sense "matched" by a "faithfulness to things," which, in the case of mourning, attaches itself to the "dead objects" (I.1.333f.; OGT 156f.) of an unredeemed world.

"Finally it must strike us that after all the melancholic does not behave in quite the same way as a person who is crushed by remorse and self-reproach in a normal fashion. Feelings of shame in front of other people, which would more than anything characterize this latter condition, are lacking in the melancholic, or at least they are not prominent in him. One might emphasize the presence in him of an almost opposite trait of insistent communicative ness which finds satisfaction in self-exposure [eine aufdringliche Mitteilsamkeit, die an der eigenen Blossstellung eine Befriedigungfindet]" (GW 10:433; SE 14:247). 16. "This, then, was the complete game—disappearance and return [ Verschwinden und Wieder kommen]. As a rule one only witnessed its first act, which was repeated untiringly as a game in itself [fiir sich allein als Spiel wiederholt], though there is no doubt that the greater pleasure was attached to the second act." A paragraph later, Freud writes of the "observed fact [Beobachtung] that the first act, that of departure, was staged as a game in itself [fiir sich allein als Spiel inszeniert], and indeed, more frequently than the episode in its entirely, with its pleasurable ending" (GW 13:126; SE 18:15f.). 17.

Freud's example of such a recollective reworking (the terms of the discussion more or less resume those set forth in "Remembering, Repeating and Working Through") is classical tragedy.

Cf. 1.1.401; OGT22T These remarks, as well as the remaining discussion, owe much to Paul de Man. See in particular "Autobiography as De-Facement" and "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," in The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984), 67-82 and 239-62 together with Derrida's comments in Mémoires: For Paul de Man, esp. 25-39.

The relevant passage reads as follows: "[Language] is the real existence [Dasein] of the pure self as self; in speech, self-consciousness, qua independent separate individuality, comes as such into existence, so that it exists for others. Otherwise the Ί,' this pare Ί,' is non-exsitent, is not there·, in every other expression it is immersed [versunken] in a reality, and is in a shape from which it can withdraw itself; it is reflected back into itself from its action, as well as from its physiognomic expression, and dissociates itself from such an imperfect existence, in which there is always at once too much as too little, letting it remain lifeless [entseelt\ behind. Language, however, contains it in its purity, it alone expresses the Ί,' the Ί' itself. This real existence [Dasein] of the Ί' is, qua real existence, an objectivity which has in it the true nature of the Ί.' The Ί' is this particular Ί' — but equally the universal Ί'; its manifesting is also at once the externalization and vanishing of this particular Ί,' and as a result the Ί' remains in its universality. The Ί' that utters itself is heard or perceived·, it is an infection which has immediately passed into unity with those for whom it is a real existence, and is a universal self-consciousness. That it is perceived or heard means that its real existence dies away [verhallt]; this its otherness has been taken back into itself; and its real existence is just this: that as a self-conscious Now, as a real existence, it is not a real existence, and through this vanishing it is a real existence. This vanishing is thus itself at once its abiding; it is its own knowing of itself, and its knowing itself as a self that has passed over into another self that has been perceived and is universal" (PhG 376; PhS 308f.). "Just as the individual self-consciousness is immediately present in language, so it is im mediately present as a universal infection; the complete separation into independent selves is at the same time the fluidity [Fliissigkeit] and the universally communicated unity of the many selves; language is the soul existing as soul" (PhG 518; PhS 430).

This reading of the ninth thesis differs from (though owes much to) those offered both by lan Balfour in "Reversal, Quotation (Benjamin's History)," MLN 106 (1991): esp. 639-41, and by Timothy Bahti, in Allegories of History (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1992), esp. 186-89.

In other texts, the angel's gender is explicitly indeterminate. See the two versions of "Agesilaus Santander" published in Gershom Scholem, On Jews and Judaism in Crisis, 204-8. The Baroque predilection for the Trauerspiel as a literary genre thus only conventionalizes by redoubling the theatricality which is already seen to be at work, or rather at play, in history as such. But since play itself tends towards a reflexive iteration or "miniaturizing" self reduplication (as in the mise-en-abyme of Romanticism) (I.1.261f.; OG7"82f.) such a conven tion would be "natural" enough at the advent of the modern age. Aristotle, On the Art of Poetry, chap. 6, in Aristotle/Horace/Longinus, Classical Literary Criticism, trans. T. S. Dorsch (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1965), 41. Ibid., chap. 4, p. 35 "The plot should be so ordered that even without seeing it performed anyone merely hearing about what is afoot will shudder with fear and pity as a result of what is happening—as indeed would be the experience of anyone hearing the story of Oedipus. To produce this effect by means of stage-spectacle is less artistic, and requires the cooperation of the producer" (ibid., chap. 14, p. 49). What is clearly at stake here is the eclipse of "cult value" by "exhibition value" as eventually elaborated in the famous essay of 1935. The "travelling stage" of the Baroque thus exemplifies what Benjamin will ultimately identify as the essential feature of modern cinema. On the connection between the "return of the gaze" and the aura, see "Some Motifs in Baudelaire" (1.2, 646Γ; ILL 188), together with my elaborations in "Framing Redemption: Aura, Origin, Technology in Benjamin and Heidegger," in Ethics and Danger: Essays on Heidegger and Continental Thought ed. Arleen Dallery and Charles Scott (Albany: SUNY, 1992), 139-67. In German only, of course. Benjamin remarks here that this convention in German orthography was introduced by the Baroque.</page></plain_text>
