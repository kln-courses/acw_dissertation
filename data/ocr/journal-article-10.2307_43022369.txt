Reviewed by Ben Quick Utah State University, Logan In Built for Speed : A Year in the Life of Pronghorn, John Byers narrates four seasons in the lives of the one hundred pronghorn antelope that roam the sagebrush steppe and forest edge of the National Bison Range in the Flathead Valley of northwestern Montana. Byers, a professional zoologist, has been studying pronghorns on the range since 1981, and his intimacy with the swift- footed ungulates makes for a compelling account of the cycles and rituals of pronghorn life. Occasionally crossing into the lyrical, Byers successfully negoti- ates the shaky ground where scientific credibility and literary merit mingle with an attention to craft too often missing from ecology-based writing. Woven into the pronghorn's story are narratives of other Bison Range wildlife, glimpses of the natural history of the region, and just enough of the personal to allow readers to identify with Byers without becoming distracted from the plight of the pronghorn. What Byers does particularly well throughout the book is to tie the turning of the seasons and the resultant changes in the rhythms of pronghorn activity to elements of the natural world rather than calendrical time. For instance, in the chapter "Spring and the Sounds of the</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 111 Snipe," the weeks critical for fawn survival begin with the noisy, aerial dis- plays of male snipes and end during the early summer serenade of the western meadowlark. But while Byers's language and descriptive clarity remain elevated and precise during these journeys into the non-pronghorn life and history of the refuge, the placement and dimensions of these forays lack consistency and completeness. For example, an entire chapter is devoted to the intricacies of the bison rut, while a scant few paragraphs are spent on the fascinating lifestyle of the prairie rattler. Both for its intrigue and its unfulfilled potential, one thread in this book stands out from the others. In the first chapter, Byers traces the evolutionary roots of pronghorn speed and endurance, which give the animals an unfair and - because of the sheer size of the discrepancy - largely unnecessary advan- tage over present-day North American predators. The biological characteristics that produce this swiftness and stamina were genetically selected during a time when lightning-fast, prehistoric cheetahs and lions pursued pronghorns across the plains of North America. The fearsome predators went extinct, leaving behind a prey species adapted to ghosts. The question this observation seems to beg, one that Byers fails to explore in any real depth, is larger than the pronghorn and twofold: How many other products of animal evolution are superfluous relics, and what are the consequences of this residue? In other words - so what? Despite its structural shortcomings and lack of organic movements from the realm of observation to conceptual questioning, this book is well worth reading - if for Byers's language alone. He illuminates the flow and tragic drama of pronghorn life in a manner that could only come from someone close to the creatures, and he captures the essence of the animal without becoming senti- mental or anthropomorphic - no small feat.</page></plain_text>
