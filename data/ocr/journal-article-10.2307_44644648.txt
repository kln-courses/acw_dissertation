Culver Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Ml Robert S. Levine Department of Orthopaedics, Wayne State University Detroit, Ml OVERVIEW Knee bolsters on the lower instrument panel have been proposed and used for occupant restraint during sudden deceleration. Theoretically, the function of the knee bolster is: 1) to control kine- matics, 2) to distribute impact loads, 3) to absorb occupant energy, and 4) to protect maximally against skin and soft tissue injury of the leg. In practice, all of these factors are expected to provide a signi- ficant benefit for the occupant in an automobile accident. Investigations were undertaken, however, to evaluate knee bolster impact biomechanics and to assess potential injuries which might be associated with the knee bolster. A heavy rigid moving mass, covered with bolster-type foam, was used to simulate a knee bolster impact. This construction is not represent- ative of current or past production applications but was chosen for its energy absorbing and load dis- tributing properties. Tibia and knee impact bio- mechanics and kinematics were investigated by various orientations of the knee bolster contact with the flexed leg in ten willed-human bodies and an -ABSTRACT - Knee bolsters on the lower instrument panel have been designed to control occupant kinematics during sudden deceleration. However, a wide variability in car occupant anthropometry and choice of seating posture indicates that lower-extremity contacts with the impingement bolster could predominantly load the flexed leg through the knee (acting through the femur) or through the tibia (acting through the knee joint). Potential injuries associated with these types of primary loading may vary significantly and an understanding of potential trauma mechanisms is important for proper occupant restraint. Impacts of the bolster panel against the knee or lower leg were simulated in 10 human cadaver and anthropomorphic dummy tests and the following aspects were assessed: 1) biomechanical response for lower-extremity im- pacts, 2) potential mechanisms of skeletal and ligamentous trauma, 3) differences between human cadavers and an anthropomorphic test dummy re- sponse, and 4) knee-joint ligament failure character- istics in isolated knee-joint tests. Knee impacts with a 55. 9 kg bolster covered mass at 6. 0 m/s resulted in frequent avulsion frac- tures of the posterior cruciate ligament at its osseous attachment to the tibia with peak contact loads of 7. 02 kN (7. 74 kN peak dummy femur load). In this study, analysis of high-speed movies and radiographs indicated that the bolster loaded a against the tibial tuberosity early in the event, trans- lated the tibia posteriorly and resulted in a stretching of the posterior cruciate ligament. Lower-leg im- pact produced tibial/fibular fractures or knee-joint ligament failures with peak bolster contact loads of 5. 15 kN (4. 21 kN peak dummy femur load). Isolated knee-joint tests indicated complete failure of the ligament after 2. 26 cm of relative posterior tibial subluxation and a resistive load of 2.48 kN. However, the absolute values of the maximally tolerated loads may be significantly influenced by the deficiencies of the cadaver model and cannot be directly extrap- olated for real-life situations. Since the lower extremity of the dummy cannot accomodate trans- latory motion at the knee joint and the skeletal mass of the dummy significantly exceeds that of the human, substantial kinematic and biomechanical response differences occurred between tested human cadavers and an anthropomorphic dummy. 3253 0096-736X/79/8704-3253$02. 50 Copyright © 1979 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">9 3254 D.C. VIANO, ET AL. anthropomorphic test dummy. Some tests represent- ed a low positioned bolster load against the tibia of the lower extremity, i.e. , impact below the knee joint. Others involved a bolster loading of the knee joint. Since serious injury to the skeleton and, more importantly, to the knee joint ligaments may result from a knee or lower leg contact with the bolster, isolated knee joint preparations were in- vestigated in anteroposterior subluxation (drawer motion) tests. In these tests posterior translation of the tibia across the fixed femur was simulated beyond complete ligamentous failure of the knee joint. The bolster impact data from the experiments of this study provide preliminary information on fundamental knee-joint biomechanics, impact kine- matics and injuries potentially associated with knee- bolster loads. METHODOLOGY Cadaver subjects* were obtained through the willed-body program administered by the School of Medicine of the University of Michigan and were tested under a collaborative program with the High- way Safety Research Institute of the University of Michigan. Prior to an experiment, the lower ex- tremities of the unembalmed specimens were care- fully examined by palpation of the knee-joint and by a series of radiographs, which included internal and external oblique, anterior- posterior, lateral, and tunnel views. This examination was performed to establish the pretest condition of the specimens' skeleton prior to lower-extremity impact experi- mentation. The cadaver specimens were generally from a population with considerably advanced age [averaging 65. 2 (+14. 8) years] and with varying de- grees of pathological and gerontological changes (particularly advanced degrees of osteoporosis and osteoarthrosis). In addition, it must be emphasized that the impact responses and injuries to the skeletal and ligamentous structures of the cadaver knee joint represent only a passive reaction of postmortem tissue with completely atonic musculature. Since the primary purpose of this program was to improve our understanding of the consequences of knee-bolster loadings on the lower extremity in automotive crashes, various modes of padded im- pact were investigated. In particular, a severe *The protocol for the use of cadavers in this study was approved by the Committee to review Grants for Clinical Research and investigation Involving Human Beings of the University of Michigan Med- ical Center and follows guidelines established by the U. S. Public Health Service and recommended by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council. lower-extremity impact was simulated by a heavy padded mass of 55.9 kg (123 lb) impinging on the knee or tibia at 5.8-6.4 m/s (13.0-14.3 mph). This range of contact velocity was selected as represent- ative of the knee contact velocity in a 13.4 m/s (30 mph) barrier crash simulation. Using a 6. 0 m/s (13.4 mph) impact velocity, the mass of the padded impactor was increased until a direct knee impact to an anthropomorphic test dummy (Hybrid III) resulted in a peak femur load of approximately 7. 60 kN (1700 lb). With the velocity of the lower- extremity impact held constant, three modes of bolster contact were investigated: 1) tibia impact (Fig. la) where the center of contact was 15 cm caudal to the approximate center of rotation of the knee joint for the leg flexed at 90°, 2) knee impact (Fig. lb) where the center Sf contact was directed at the approximate rotational pivot of the knee joint for the leg flexed at 90° , and 3) knee -tibia impact (Fig. lc) where the center of contact was directed at the center of rotation of the knee joint for a leg flexed at 45°. The padded contact area for the first Fig. 1 - Orientation of the bolster impact simulations conducted on the lower extremity of human cadavers and a Hybrid III dummy: a) lower leg impact, b) knee impact, and c) knee -tibia impact two test modes was a flat, square-faced (15 cm by 15 cm) piece of 5. 7 cm thickness foam material with a stiffness of 3. 2 kN/cm and density of 112 kg/nr*. The knee flexion of 90° was chosen to simulate the orientation of the lower extremity in contact with the knee bolster, based on a fixed heel- point and a horizontal H-point translation up to the full knee contact with a 50th percentile occupant in a midseat position (i. e. , with approximately 10 cm of knee-to-instrument panel clearance). The last test mode utilized an interface pad of 11. 5 cm thick- ness with a lower edge taper of 45° , which conformed with the orientation of the flexed leg. Since the inter- face padding was subject to plastic deformations in these test modes, a new bolster was attached to the rigid impactor mass for each experiment. Impactor kinetics were monitored by a load cell, which inter- faced the contact pad and impactor mass, and an</page><page sequence="3">BOLSTER IMPACTS 3255 acc ele rome ter, attached to the rigid impactor. Lateral high-speed movies at 1000 fps for the far- field response and 3000 fps for the near-field re- sponse recorded lower- extremity kinematics. The test subject was positioned (Fig. 2) in an upright seating posture on a low friction mock-up seat with the upper body restrained by a harness and overhead tethers. The foot was fitted with a rubber soled shoe, which rested on a plywood support. The Fig. 2 - Experimental setup for the axially guided impact mass of 55. 9 kg which contacted the lower extremity at approximately 6. 0 m/s impact was delivered by a 55. 9 kg (123 lb) mass which was axially guided. The impactor was accel- erated up to the full contact velocity by a free falling weight- matched pendulum, which transferred energy to the axial impactor. About 15 cm of impactor dis- placement against the lower extremity occurred be- fore the motion of the impacting mass was arrested. Varying amounts of energy were transferred during the impact, depending on the test mode and subject. The impact involved only one leg at a time and only one test was conducted per leg. The lower extremity was then reexamined by palpation of the knee-joint and by radiography. A necropsy was subsequently conducted to identify gross injuries to the knee-joint ligaments and/or lower-extremity skeleton. A GM Hybrid III anthropomorphic dummy [1]* was subjected to nominally the same velocity of lower-extremity impact for the three test orienta- tions. Four replicated tests were conducted for each environment and dummy femur loads were obtained in addition to the loads measured at the impactor. The test dummy was also equipped with a prototype instrumented lower leg, which measured the axial component of tibial compression and tibial bending at a location 15 cm and 25 cm below the knee joint pivot axis. The dummy mechanical and kinematic responses were compared with the cadaver data. Specifically, similarities and differences between both models were analysed, as they affect the correct assessment of occupant knee restraint interactions in anthropomorphic test devices. Isolated knee-joint tests were also conducted on cadaver tissues. The experiments involved a servo- controlled testing machine. Dynamic posterior drawer displacement at a constant loading rate of 1. 8 m/s (4 mph) was simulated by posteriorly trans- lating the tibia across the fixed femur for 5. 0 cm which was beyond total joint failure. In these tests both the mid- tibial and mid-femoral shafts were dissected, cleansed, potted in cylindrical sleeves and attached to the platen and actuator in the testing machine, respectively. The preparation further in- volved removal of the patella and tissue covering the knee joint. Caution was exercised, though, not to disrupt the joint capsule and the ligamentous struc- tures of the knee.

VIANO, ET AL. was applied completely below the knee joint so that y the resultant loads were transferred only by the ligamentous structures of the knee joint to the whole body mass. Evaluation of the impact kinematics (Fig. 3) for this test mode indicated a considerable posterior tibial subluxation. The translation repre- Fig. 3 - Impact kinematics for the lower leg bolster contact against a human cadaver (Test No. 77L003) and Hybrid III dummy sented an unusual level of passive joint laxity of the ligamentous links between the long skeletal bones in the cadavers. The peak bolster contact force aver- aged 5. 15 kN (1160 lb) and resulted in several modes of moderate (AIS 2) to serious (AIS 4) injury. All female subjects exhibited comminuted fractures of the tibia/fibula (Fig. 4); whereas, the male subjects exhibited tears and avulsions of the lateral or poste- rior cruciate ligament (Fig. 5) or no gross injury. It appears that the skeletal strength of the lower leg in the female subjects was not sufficient to withstand the tibial bending loads created by the loads trans - Fig. 4 - Skeletal fractures of the tibia and fibular (Test No. 77L003) for a lower leg impact Fig. 5 - Avulsion fracture of the posterior cruciate ligament and intercondylar eminence at the tibial plateau fer red through the knee and ankle joints at the prox- imal and distal ends of the tibia. This is in contrast to the male subjects, which displayed sufficiently strong lower- leg bones. In these tests the resistance to the bending and shear resulted in greater load transfer through the knee joint to the lower torso. In two cases, a major ligament of the knee joint was seriously injured by avulsion from its osseous attachment on the tibial plateau or fibular apex. In two other specimens, load transfer to the knee joint occurred without subsequent gross injury (AIS&gt; 2). Knee Impact - A series of eight additional knees were impacted (Table 2) to investigate the injury potential of a padded knee impact. The bolster con- tact was applied to the knee so that load was directly transferred by the femur to the more massive pelvis. Evaluation of the impact kinematics (Fig. 6) for these tests indicated a favorable dissipation of the impact energy. The peak bolster contact force averaged 7. 02 kN (1580 lb) but unexpectedly resulted in frequent knee joint injury. The most predominant mode of injury involved avulsion of the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) from the tibial plateau. The avulsion failures occurred via two different mechanisms. Either a small fragment of the spongy bone at the PCL insertion to the intercondylar eminence was pulled away from the plateau (Fig. 5), or the tibial plateau was fractured across the entire</page><page sequence="5">BOLSTER IMPACTS 3257 Table 2 Knee Impact Responses Experiment No. Cadaver Characteristics Impact Biomechanics Gross Injuries Peak Primary Peak Contact Sex Age Mass Height Velocity Acceleration Pulse Duration Force Specimen No. (M/F) (yr) ļķgļ (m) (m/s) (g) (ms) (kN) 77L010 20869/R F 79 60 1.50 6.42 10.8 17 5.91 Femoral condyles and shaft fracture 77L012 20881/L M 69 75 1.71 6.43 14.3 26 7.82 Posterior cruciate ligament central tear 77L016 20896/L M 58 73 1.73 6.43 10.5 30 5.91 No indicated damage 78L017 20901/L F 39 54 1.62 6.25 11.3 -- 6.38 Lateral tibial plateau avulsion fracture 78L018 20904/R F 82 64 1.55 6.31 13.4 31 7.57 Patella dislocated; posterior cruciate lig- ament avulsion 78L019 20904/L F 82 64 1.55 6.31 14.8 24 8.36 Patella dislocated; posterior cruciate lig- ament avulsion 78L032 20922/R F 55 64 1.69 6.32 11.0 27 6.88 Tibial plateau avulsion fracture 78L033 20922/L F 55 64 1.69 6.32 13.7 29 7.32 Tibial plateau avulsion fracture Averages 2/4 63.7 65.0 1.63 6.35 12.5 26.3 7.02 (Standard Deviation) ( ♦ 16.0) (-7.9) (*.09) (&gt;0.07) (-1.8) ('4.8) ( *0.90) Fig. 6 - Impact kinematics for the knee bolster con- tact against a human cadaver (Test No. 77L010) and Hybrid III dummy condylar plate (Fig. 7) and hinged from the anterior aspect of the plateau. In both cases, posterior trans- lation of the tibia appeared to put the PCL into ten- sion. The PCL tension, which resulted in local Fig. 7 - Plateau fracture of the tibia through exten- sion of the posterior cruciate ligament strain concentrations near the tibial insertion, can be explained by the geometry of the knee joint struc- ture. The injury occurs primarily at the weakest anatomical link. Since an advanced degree of osteo- porosis weakens the compact and spongy bone, it can predispose for an avulsion fracture rather than for a failure of the fibrous ligament [2], In several tests, skeletal fractures of the femoral condyles or patella occurred in the female subjects. The high frequency occurrence of serious knee joint trauma was not expected since the bolster load was applied against the knee in this test mode. Tibial impacts indicated that PCL failure might occur through posterior translation of the tibia with respect to the femur. PCL tension can result in central tears of the ligament or avulsion fractures at the tibial insertion into the plateau. Radiographic evaluation of the skeletal structure and orientation of the femur and tibia in the knee joint suggested why PCL injury can also occur in this direct knee impact. When the lower leg is flexed at 90° (Fig. 8), the anterior protuberance of the tibial plateau is well ahead of the femoral condyles. Even though the bolster contacts the knee joint, the lower edge of the bolster first loads the tibial protuberance. The early tibial loading causes posterior translation of the tibia with respect to the femur. The PCL can</page><page sequence="6">3258 D.C. VIANO, ET AL. Fig. 8 - Radiographie interpretation of the relative position of the femoral condyles and tibial plateau in the knee joint for various leg orientation angles be stretched prior to any substantial femoral involve- ment, and fail, as in the lower-leg impacts. General dissipation of impact energies may appear favorable from analysis of the subsequent kinematics, but when the leg is flexed at an angle of 90° , as used in this program, anatomic configuration of the tibia in the knee joint frequently led to posterior cruciate ligament failures via tearing or avulsion in the cadavers. An additional observation was apparent from the anatomic configuration of the femur and .tibia in the knee for a flexion angle of 110° (Fig. 8). Previous direct knee impact experiments [3-6], which utilized a flexion angle of 110°, did not result in apparent knee joint ligament damage. Unfortunately, only a few specimens were autopsied for potential knee joint trauma so that the actual frequency of knee joint in- jury in unembalmed cadavers is somewhat specula- tive in the previous impact experiments, but the relative orientation of the tibial plateau with respect to the femoral condyles is significantly different with a leg flexion angle of 110° (Fig. 9a). During a direct knee impact this bone configuration appears to en- hance compression of the soft tissue of the knee joint and deformation of the femur. The patella is in line with the femoral axis and as such, is more likely to be compressed rather than to ride up the condylar surface, as occurs with the 90° flexion. Little or no relative motion is created between the tibia and femur in the knee joint for a flexion angle of 110° , so that resulting tension in the PCL is minimal. As the load is primarily applied through the femur, skeletal injury to the condyles (via patella wedging or bending fracture), shaft (via AP bending of the long bone), or head/neck (via shearing and bending) predominate. Unfortunately, the characteristics of the knee impact simulations in the published cadaver experiments [3-8] were also substantially different from the protocol used in this study. A lightweight impactor (10-20 kg) was frequently accelerated to high velocities (8-12 m/s) in order to create a po- tential for femoral injury. The test conditions generally resulted in high contact forces (10. 0-20. 0 kN) of relatively short duration (4-12 ms). The actual contribution of these variations in impact conditions on resultant biomechanical and injury re- sponses is unknown, but it may be assumed that many factors are responsible for the differences observed between the present and previous studies. The test modes, applied in this program, were de- veloped to closely simulate expected knee impact velocities (4. 5-7.2 m/s) and lower extremity orien- tations that an occupant might experience in a 13.4 m/s (30 mph) barrier crash. Lower-leg impacts in this program induced posterior subluxation of the tibia (Fig. 9b) resulting in AP bending of the tibia/fibula and stretching of the posterior cruciate ligament, which is the pri- mary restraining ligament for this type of motion [9] . Skeletal fractures were regularly produced to the lower leg in osteoporotic cases as well as occasional knee joint trauma in the subjects with a well-miner- alized skeleton. Unexpectedly, direct knee impacts also created posterior translation of the tibia with respect to the femur (Fig. 9c). In this test mode, substantial joint displacements seem to have occurred before a significant portion of the load was transferred to the femur/pelvis system. Excessive posterior cruciate ligament tension frequently re- sulted in gross joint trauma. The injury was mani- fested by a central tearing of the PCL, or by an avulsion at its attachment to the tibia plateau. Again, frequent skeletal injury was observed in the osteo- porotic cases. Skeletal fractures were generally absent in the male subjects. For knee impacts, direct skeletal fractures were infrequent, but avul- sion fractures through PCL stretching were a regular consequence of the bolster contact for this test environment. The 90° leg flexion used in this phase of the investigation is more typical of the lower leg orientation at contact with a knee bolster than would be the 110° configuration used in many previous studies. Damage to the posterior cruciate ligaments was identified during autopsy of the knee joint. Palpation of the joint and radiographs taken of each tested joint were also regularly conducted but neither tech- nique diagnosed the posterior cruciate ligament damage. The data obtained in a few test subjects are obviously limited by the small size of the group and should not be considered as satisfactorily represent- ative of the normal driving population. In addition, the cadaver subjects used in this program were from a high age cohort, demonstrated signs of senescence and exhibited various degrees of osteoporosis. In this respect the cadaver subjects must be considered highly susceptible to skeletal injury in contrast with the general population. This factor may account, in</page><page sequence="7">BOLSTER IMPACTS 3259 Fig. 9 - Schematic representation of pertinent lower extremity impact kinematics and resultant injuries: a) knee loading with a 110° flexed lower leg [3-6], b) lower leg bolster loading with a 90° flexed lower leg, and c) knee bolster loading also with a 90° flexion angle part, for the frequent fracturing of bones rather than central ligament tears which might be expected in the middle-age healthy driving population. The experiments, however, indicate a new direction for improved effectiveness of knee bolster restraint design. Typical flexion of the lower leg and location of the knee joint at the time of contact with a knee bolster restraint seems to be a factor important for the mitigation of serious knee joint injury. It would be recommendable that the plane of the knee bolster face the knee joint in such a way that the primary load acts through the femur and not through the tibia or across the knee joint. Loading through the tibia or across the knee joint can pro- duce extreme and potentially injurious effects on the posterior cruciate ligament. It is interesting that most knee injuries in human cadavers were observed when the integrity of the foam interface was preserved during the impact. In contrast, no injuries were observed in cadaver tests where permanent damage to the foam was produced (Fig. 11). Generally speaking, the cadaver tests were significantly less destructive to the foam inter- face than the comparative dummy interaction. The difference between injurious and noninjurious cadav- er test foams seems to indicate that a bolster of lower structural stiffness would have been preferable for minimizing certain types of injuries to the cadavers. It appears that design of a knee restraint based primarily on dummy tests may lead to a bol- ster that is stiffer than recommendable for human restraint, because the dummy's rigid and massive knee penetrates more extensively into the bolster pad than the human cadaver's knee. Knee-Tibia Impact - A final series of four pendulum impact experiments were conducted (Table 3) to investigate the consequences of a tapered bolster contact against the knee and tibia of a 45° flexed lower leg. Evaluation of the impact kine- matics (Fig. 10) indicated that the joint underrode the tapered bolster while only part of the available impactor energy was transferred to the femur/pelvis system. Substantial transverse (superior-inferior) loads were also applied but not measured in the axially-controlled impact. In this test mode the leg extended by underriding the shaped bolster rather than gradually accelerating the lower part of the body forward. The peak bolster contact force aver- aged 3. 66 kN (820 lb) and resulted in no gross or apparent injury of the lower extremity. Comparative Hybrid III Dummy Impacts - A series of four dummy impact experiments (Table 4) were conducted for each of the three pendulum im- pact modes. In addition to the basic bio mechanical indices of the cadaver tests, a direct dummy femoral load was recorded as well as measures of tibial compression and betiding responses in an instrument- Table 3 Knee-Tibia Impact Responses Experiment No. Cadaver Characteristics Impact Biomechanics Gross Injuries ' Peak Primary Peak Contact Sex Age Mass Height Velocity Acceleration Pulse Duration Force Specimen No. (M/F) (yr) (kg) (m) (m/s) (g) (ms) ( kN) 77L002 20817/L M 41 55 1.70 5.90 4.2 33 2.30 No indicated damage 77L004 20823/R F 67 65 1.64 6.26 7.2 24 3.97 No indicated damage 77L006 20824/L F 85 59 1.51 6.37 7.5 19 4.10 No indicated damage 77L008 20827/L M 78 89 1.79 6.33 7.8 45 4.27 No indicated damage Averages 2/2 67.8 67.0 1.66 6.22 6.7 30.3 3.65 (Standard Deviation) (»19.0) ( - 1 5 . 2 ) ( ■ 0 . 1 2 ) (»0.21) («1.7) (-11. 4) (»0.91)</page><page sequence="8">3260 D.C.

The bolster contact loads were 50% to 120% higher in the dummy tests than in the cadaver impact of a comparable severity. Such inertial response differences are a consequence of the higher mass of the dummy skeleton and its pinned joints, as opposed to the lightweight skeleton and greater joint laxity of the cadaver knees. In addition, the rigid skeletal structure of the dummy produced significant tearing of the bolster interfaces in all test modes; whereas, only minor scuffs or tears were observed in the cadaver tests. A peak femur load of 4. 2 kN (950 lb was pro- duced in the lower leg dummy impacts (see Fig. 3). Due to the pinned dummy knee joint, no relative skeletal translations occurred so that more of the dummy1 s inertia is involved in the early phases of bolster contact.

Direct knee impact (see Fig. 6) resulted in 7. 74 kN (1740 lb) of peak femur load in the dummy. The knee-tibia impacts (see Fig. 10) produced the most dissimilar impact responses between the cadavers and test dummy. Again, the inertial and joint char- acteristic differences of the dummy constituted the major cause for biomechanical dissimilarities. As the dummy knee also underrode the bolster pad in the knee-tibia impacts and more substantially penetrated the foam material, a greater contact force developed due to an increased interaction with the impactor. The mean peak contact force and impactor acceleration differed significantly between the dummy and cadaver in all test modes when a t-test analysis was applied. Obviously, the anatomical features of the human knee joint are not replicated by the pinned metal knee of the dummy and, in part, lead to different kinematical and biomechanical responses for all types of bolster impact simulations. Tibial compression and bending responses observed in the Hybrid III dummy experiments (Table 4) are included for reference purposes only. An axial tibial compression force as well as AP bending were measured at two locations using an instrumented prototype dummy lower leg, but the immense struc- tural differences between the dummy and human lower extremity do not permit any judgement on the significance of the measured values. Isolated Knee Joint Tolerance Tests - Since posterior subluxation (drawer motion) of the tibia with respect to the femur was noted in the previous experiments, in vitro knee joint tolerance experiments simulating this motion were conducted on five prep- arations from cadavers previously tested but unin- jured (e.g., specimens from the knee-tibia impact experiments). The tolerance test involved transla- tion (subluxation) of the tibia across the femur in a 90° flexion until complete joint failure. In this test three general modes of joint failure were observed (Table 5): 1) mid-ligament rupture of the PCL (Fig. 13), 2) avulsion fracture of the PCL from its attachment at the tibial plateau (Figs. 5 and 7), and 3) tibial shaft fracture near the cylindrical potting sleeve of the test fixture. Interestingly, several of the joint force -displace ment curves (Fig. 12) showed a plateau in the response. Similar plateaus were noted in tolerance studies of the anterior cruciate ligament [10]. The plateau was interpreted as a partial ligament failure caused by localized rupture of collagen fibers. This plateau occurred at a joint load of 2.02 kN (450 lb) and relative tibial-femoral displacement of 1. 44 cm (0. 57 in. ). Although the validity of this interpretation is still unknown, it may be assumed that the PCL is permanently stretched through local failures of collagen fibers. Partial or complete failure of the PCL can lead to a permanent knee-joint dysfunction and osteoarthrosis [11, 12], Continued joint displacement resulted in increasing joint resistance until an ultimate collapse at a load of 2. 48 kN (560 lb) and relative displace- ment of 2. 26 cm (0. 80 in. ). Although the anterior and collateral ligaments and posterior capsule appeared grossly intact, the general joint resistance fails when these limits are exceeded. Based on a comparison of the results from the knee joint tolerance tests and the pendulum impact experiments, nearly 50% of the peak bolster contact load must be interpreted as associated with inertial displacements of bodty masses. The other half of the contact load is responsible for structural de- formations, such as stretching of the posterior cruciate ligament and bending of bony structures.

Fig. 13 - Central tear of the posterior cruciate liga- ment exhibiting a "mop end" rupture characteristic Certainly stretching of the PCL can lead to central or avulsion failure of the joint ligament. Since liga- mentous injuries have the further potential of developing an abnormal joint function with long-term consequences in the form of degenerative osteo- arthritic changes, these observations indicate the importance of the design alignment and character- ises of the knee restraint system. SUMMARY (1) Lower extremity impacts to human cadavers and an anthropomorphic dummy (Hybrid III) were conducted with a 55. 9 kg rigid mass interfaced with 5. 7 cm of bolster-type foam material. A contact velocity of approximately 6. 0 m/s was selected to simulate a realistic knee bolster impact. This im- pact velocity was sufficient to produce approximately 7. 60 kN (1700 lb) peak femur load in a knee impact to the test dummy. Three impact modes were in- vestigated in this phase of the experimental program: a. Lower leg impacts were directed against the tibia below the knee joint of a 90° flexed lower leg (see Figs, la and 3) in seven cadaver tests. The bolster impact produced 5. 15 kN peak contact force and resulted in multiple tibial-fibular fractures in three female cadavers, knee joint ligament fail- ures in two male cadavers and no gross injury in two other male subjects. The tibia-fibula was noted by kinematic analysis to posteriorly translate with respect to the femur/pelvis prior to substantial energy transfer to the torso. This relative dis- placement produced knee joint loads by stretching the posterior cruciate ligament. b. Knee impacts were directed against the knee of a 90° flexed lower leg (see Figs, lb and 6) in eight cadaver tests. The bol- ster impact produced 7. 02 kN peak contact force and resulted in failure of the osseous attachment at the tibial plateau or central portion of the posterior cruciate ligament in five female and one male cadaver. The femoral condyles in another female subject were fractured. Only one test did not re- sult in gross knee joint injury. The tibial plateau was noted to anteriorly protrude in the knee complex so that direct knee con- tact could result in posterior translation of the tibia prior to substantial femoral involve- ment. Relative joint displacements of this type caused posterior cruciate ligament tension, which resulted in regular liga- mentous damage. The avulsion mode of posterior cruciate ligament injury predom- inated because the cadaver specimens were aged and frequently weak-boned due to osteoporosis. c. Knee-tibia impacts were directed against the knee complex of a 45° flexed lower leg (see Figs, lc and 10) in four cadaver tests. The tappe red bolster impact produced 3. 66 kN peak contact force, which resulted in no apparent injury. In this test configuration, the leg extended by underriding the bolster. d. Comparative Hybrid III impacts were con- ducted for each cadaver test mode. For a lower leg impact, the dummy contact force was significantly greater, 8.46 kN (64% Hi), than in comparable cadaver tests. The peak femur load was 4. 21 kN for an impact, which correspondingly produced severe skeletal or ligamentous injury in five of seven cadavers. Several structural dis- similarities contributed to differences in the comparative dummy-to-human cadaver responses: 1) the pinned metal knee joint did not permit relative displacements be- tween the femur and tibia in the joint, 2) the heavy metal skeleton and pinned joints produced larger inertial responses and contact forces during impact, and 3) the rigid skeleton penetrated and damaged the bolster foam more extensively than in any cadaver test. For a knee impact, the dummy contact force was again significantly greater, 10.85 kN (55% Hi), than in the comparable cadaver tests. The peak femur load was 7. 74 kN for a padded knee impact, which produced severe posterior cruciate ligament and skeletal injury in seven or eight cadavers. Again, structural dis- similarities of the dummy's knee joint and</page><page sequence="11">BOLSTER IMPACTS 3 263 skeleton contributed to the response differ- ences. For a knee- tibia impact, the dummy contact force was proportionately higher, 8. 22 kN (125% Hi), than in the comparable cadaver tests. Both surrogates significantly underrode the tappe red bolster, but the dummy's knee penetration was markedly more pronounced. In this test environment, no cadaver injuries were noted at a com- parable peak femur load of 5. 61 kN. e. General observations: Due to the anterior position of the tibial plateau and protuber- ance in the knee joint for a 90° lower-leg flexion angle, the orientation and size of the bolster at contact with the knee seems crucial for minimizing the potential for knee-joint trauma. In this study, a verticle bolster orientation for the direct knee im- pacts produced injuries by inducing posterior translation of the tibia before substantial femur/hip complex involvement. It is possible that a bolster face orientation, which more concurrently loaded the femoral condyles and tibial plateau, or that a bolster of a different size, shape and stiffness would reduce the risk of injury to the poste- rior cruciate ligament and its osseous attachments in the knee joint. Damage to the posterior cruciate ligament was identi- fied at autopsy of the knee joint. Neither joint palpation or radiographic evaluation diagnosed the ligamentous damage. Although frequent injury was produced in both the lower leg and knee impact experiments, the aged cadavers generally exhibited patho- logical and gerontological changes, such as osteoporosis and osteoarthrosis. These conditions can significantly reduce the load carrying ability of the cadaveri skeleton. In addition, only a passive postmortal knee joint muscular state was realized in the cadaver preparations. The consequences of these effects are not well understood ex- cept that they can substantially lower the injury threshold in the cadaver. (2) Isolated knee joint preparations from five unembalmed cadavers were subjected to controlled posterior tibial subluxation across the femur. These dynamic tolerance tests indicated ultimate joint collapse at 2. 48 kN relative joint load after 2. 26 cm relative tibial displacement. Joint collapse occurred through failure of the posterior cruciate ligament, via a central ligamentous tear or avulsion fracture. Several force -displace ment responses exhibited a biphasic mode of failure. It is felt that partial liga- ment failure may occur by local rupture of collagen fibers at the first peak, which averaged 2.02 kN relative joint resistance at 1.44 cm posterior tibial displacement.
