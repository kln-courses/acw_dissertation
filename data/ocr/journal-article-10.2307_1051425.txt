<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SHEMA: SPIRITUALITY AND LAW IN JUDAISM. By Norman Lamm. Philadelphia and Jerusalem: The Jewish Publication Society of America 1998. Pp. 214. $20.96. ISBN: 0-827-60655-9. Many years ago, on the first day of a visit to Israel, I recall lying in bed very early in the morning, jet-lagged, and turning on the radio to Kol Yisrael, the Israel Broadcast Network. The very first voice that I heard was a deep baritone, reciting in impeccable Israeli Hebrew, the words that began the broadcast day. The words were Deuteronomy 6:5- 9, commonly known as the Shema, the opening Hebrew word of the passage. That the national radio network of this moder secular state should begin the broadcast day with a recitation of this biblical passage is itself worthy of a full-length treatise. But it also testifies to the enduring power of these verses in Jewish life. The first of these verses, conventionally (though not always, as this book amply demonstrates) translated as "Hear O Israel: the Lord is our God, the Lord is One," is arguably the single Hebrew passage that almost every Jew, however minimal his or her identification with Judaism, will recognize and even chant. It appears multiple times in the daily, Sabbath and Festival liturgies, and to this day, pious Jews hope to recite it with their last breath. An almost word-for-word exploration of the meaning of these verses is the topic of this book by Rabbi Norman Lamm, President of Yeshiva University, and the pre-eminent spokesperson for the "Modern" or "Centrist" (as opposed to the more right-wing) Orthodox branch of the Jewish religious community. The author provides us with a treasury of commentaries on this passage, ranging far and wide over two millennia, drawing upon traditional Jewish sources from the Talmud and midrashic literature, medieval and modem Jewish philosophy and biblical exegesis, mysticism, hasidism, and moder Hebrew literature, including the implications of the passage for moder psychology and the natural sciences. He poses fundamental questions relating to the meaning of the passage: Are we commanded to "hear"? Or to "listen"? Or to "listen to"? Or to "take heed"? Who is "Israel"? The people or the person? In what sense is God "one"? "One" but not two or more? Or "one" in the sense of "alone"? Or as connoting the integrity of God's personhood? 231</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF LA W &amp; RELIGION And how can we be commanded to love God? Lamm's commentary knits all of this material together. The result is an extended reflection on this central affirmation of Jewish faith. The author is firmly rooted both in Judaism's traditional sources and its religious perspective. He is also fully cognizant of the issues confronting the believer in the modem age. The book as a whole is, in effect, a deeply personal testimony, what a contemporary believing Jew reflects upon as he recites these words daily. The subtitle of the book is important. Though this passage originates in the Bible, it has for centuries served as the centerpiece of Jewish worship. Prayer is arguably the most complex form of religious expression, and Jewish prayer is particularly complex. What Lamm calls "spirituality" and "law" represent the two polarities with which every Jew must struggle during every moment of prayer, indeed during every moment of life. On one hand, prayer requires inner focus, total concentration, or, to use the Hebrew term, kavvanah. On the other hand, Jewish law structures the act of prayer as it structures every other form of human behavior: what words you say, when, how, where and in whose company you say them, are all subject to a rigorous legal analysis, as rigorous as any other issue in Jewish ritual or interpersonal activity. But how can inwardness be subject to this kind of discipline? The simple answer is that the worshiper must work at it. That tension is everywhere in Jewish prayer but nowhere more strikingly than in the opening verse of this passage which, alone among all the words of Jewish prayer, must be recited with kavvanah. To the credit of the author, his analysis of that tension does not overwhelm the book as a whole; the traditional legal strictures governing the recitation of the passage are relegated to an Appendix. Also to his credit is that he is not carried away by the more recent faddish interest in popular spirituality; there is nothing "New Age-ish" in his use of that term. He means, instead, nothing less than the core of the religious life, that rare moment when the soul soars and the world is left behind. He acknowledges that there is something "anarchic" about that moment, that it easily leads to antinomianism, a cardinal Jewish sin. That is why we also need the discipline of the law. For this reader, the most fascinating chapter in this entire book explores the implications of the verse, immediately following the Shema itself, that commands that we love God with all our heart, with all our soul and with all our might. "Does God need our love?" Lamm asks. He proceeds with a discussion of some classical opinions on the use of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic characterizations of God, both pro 232 [Vol. XVII</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEW and con, then to the claim that God is viewed in many classical sources as being "needy," as having feelings, then to the implication that God should not necessarily be viewed as representing total, unchanging and transcendent perfection, as having it "all-together," that God can be perceived as suffering, vulnerable, as needing humanity and as even lonely, as we are lonely. Lamm acknowledges that all of these are human projections, and that we should never take them "too literally." Yet he also acknowledges not only the inevitability of these metaphors but also their psychological value. "As we meet God, loneliness encounters loneliness; and as each of us offers his loneliness as a gift to the other, we experience relief, as it were, from cosmic loneliness." (121) Throughout, Lamm successfully navigates the narrow line separating the academic and the popular. The scholarship that underlies the choice of commentaries is impressive. The author is clearly a master of his sources which are rich, varied and exhaustive, but his translations are felicitous and his own writing is eminently accessible. Both the scholar and the ordinary worshiper will lear an enormous amount from his work, as did this reader. The comprehensive Index of themes and authors cited, indispensable for an anthology of this kind, make it even more useful. All in all, this book constitutes a notable contribution to the literature of contemporary religious thought. Neil Gillmant t Aaron Rabinowitz and Simon H.
