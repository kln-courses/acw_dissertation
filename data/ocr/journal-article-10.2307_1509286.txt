ROSENBLATT UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA 19104 ALTHOUGH the relationship between the Biblical figures Abraham and Adam underlies episodes in Books V, VIII, XI, and XII of Paradise Lost, only the significance of the parallels in the last two books has been explored fully. Barbara Kiefer Lewalski finds that the transition from vision to narration in Michael's presenta- tion of history, coinciding with the story of Abraham, symbolizes Adam's initial revelation through faith of a covenantal relation- ship with God.' Stressing the similarities between Abraham's departure from Ur and Adam's from Eden, Mother Mary Chris- topher Pecheux believes that this association "enriches and uni- versalizes Milton's theme, helps to emphasize the virtues of the Christian hero, and reinforces the paradox of the fortunate fall." 2 Moreover, the topic of Abraham's departure from his homeland affords Milton the opportunity of incorporating the epic-journey motif into his poem.3 The lack of any such extensive consideration of the Abraham- Adam parallel in Book VIII is understandable. Abraham's argu- ment with God on behalf of the Sodomites is not the only possible source of Adam's dialogue with Him on the subject of a fit mate. John E. Parish cites three Biblical episodes in which Abraham and Moses plead with God to mollify His anger and spare His people and relates them to the dialogue between the Father and Son in Book III as well as to that between God and Adam in Book VIII.4 Since the telescoping of these three Biblical episodes 1 Structure and the Symbolism of Vision in Michael's Prophecy, Paradise Lost, Books XI-XII, Philological Quarterly XLII (1963), 29-32. 2 Abraham, Adam, and the Theme of Exile in Paradise Lost, PMLA LXXX (1965), 370. 3 Ibid., 370f.

Such difficulties do not obtain in a consideration of Book V, for resemblances between the visit of the angels to Abraham at Mamre and Raphael's descent to Eden are singular and unmistakable. James H. Sims has noted numerous similarities of detail in the two events, including the noontime approach, the submissive host, the hospitality afforded the angelic visitants, the angels' promise of blessed issue, and a statement of God's judgment on the sinful.5 Although Sims assumes that Milton took his account of the epi- sode at Mamre from the Authorized Version of the Bible, the poetic rendition of Genesis i8:I suggests instead the poet's familiarity with the original Hebrew. Raphael has just set foot in Eden: Him through the spicy Forest onward come Adam discern'd, as in the door he sat Of his cool Bow'r, while now the mounted Sun Shot down direct his fervid Rays, to warm Earth's inmost womb, more warmth than Adam needs. (V, 298-302) 6 The relevant verse appears as follows in the Authorized Version: "And the Lord appeared unto him, in the plaines of Mamre: and he sate in the tent doore, in the heat of the day." I The Hebrew phrase X81= t ? does not mean "plaines of Mamre" but rather "oaks of Mamre." The omission of any reference to plains and the statement that Raphael is discerned walking in the "spicy Forest" suggest Milton's awareness of the correct Hebrew term. Moreover, none of the Bibles which Milton would have been ex- "JAMES H.

Such close attention to specific detail should prompt us to follow the poet's lead in considering this episode carefully. Additional evidence that Milton had the angels' visit to Abra- ham in mind is furnished by the controversial and unequivocal description of the paradisiac feast: "So down they sat, / And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly / The Angel, nor in mist, the com- mon gloss of Theologians" (V, 433-36). Bishop Newton, usually a perspicacious commentator on Milton (especially where the Bible is concerned), suggested that these lines are a reference to Tobit 12:19.9 His reference, however, is hardly relevant, for in that verse the angel states explicitly: "All these daies I did appeare unto you, but I did neither eat nor drinke, but you did see a vision." Doubtless, the verse which has generated the most controversy on the problem of angelic digestion is Genesis 18:8, which describes Abraham's preparation of food at Mamre: "And he tooke butter, and milke, and the calfe which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree: and they did eate." The mainstream of Biblical commentary on this verse focuses on the problem posed by the last phrase. An- drew Willet, who sides with Calvin in insisting that the angels did eat indeed, takes a brief account of the opposition: We neither thinke with Theodoret, that these angels seemed onely to have bodies, and so also seemed to eate, but neither in truth, nor with St. Thomas who thinketh that they assumed a true bodie, sed non vera fuit comestura, but it was no true eating.'0 s See, for example, the rendition of the verse in the following editions: Biblia sacra, sive Testamentum vetus, ab. Im. Tremellio et Fr. Iunio ex Hebraeo Latine redditum (London, i68o): "Apparuit porro i Jehova in planitie Mamrae"; The Holie Bible (Bishop's version) (London, 1572): "And the Lorde appeared unto hym in the plaine of Mamre"; The Holy Bible (Geneva version) (London, 1578): "Againe the Lord Appeared unto him in the plaine of Mamre"; Biblia Sacra Vulgatae Editionis, ed. P. Michael Hetzenauer (Ratisbonae et Romae, 1922): "Apparuit autem ei Dominus in convalle Mambre." Milton's use of the correct term suggests only that, confronted with a number of possible translations, he chose the correct one. * The Poetical Works of John Milton, vol.

Since the appearance of the angels was no prophetic vision but an actual visit, Calvin sees every reason for assuming that God provided at least temporary human form for the heavenly visitants." The extensive controversy on this verse makes Gervase Babington somewhat abrasive. He comments rather irritably: For their eating, wee know it was but the dispensation for the time, not for any necessity of nature. And if you aske what became of the meate which they did eate, the Schoolemen will readily answer you, that it did vanish in the chawing, as water doth in boyling. Wiser men aske no such questions, and therefore need no such answer. In the extraordinary dealings of God, what need we to sift his secrets, and to be wise above sobriety? 12 Since it appears that the influence of the Genesis account on Raphael's descent to Eden is strong and pervasive, the relationship might perhaps stand up to the sort of scrutiny which has been applied to the Abraham-Adam relationship in the final books of Paradise Lost. Mother Mary Christopher Pecheux readily ac- knowledges the essential validity of the Eden-Mamre compari- son,"3 though she does not concern herself with it. Though James H. Sims notes numerous similarities in detail between the two episodes, his whimsical discussion of the implications of the association is wide of the mark. Sims argues that Adam's simi- larities to Abraham help to make him more human and are there- fore dramatically effective: Without some such association, Adam might continue to be a per- fect superman physically, mentally, and spiritually, a character with whom it would be hard to sympathize and whose reality as a char- acter would be difficult to accept.14 nA Commentarie of John Calvine, upon the first booke of Moses called Genesis, translated by Thomas Tymme (London, 1578), 381.

Sims implies that the humanity which Adam derives from Abra- ham is compounded mostly of weakness and importunity. Thus, unfallen Adam is demonstrably superior to Abraham in his dia- logue with God: Adam's straightforwardness raises him, by contrast, above Abra- ham. Abraham repeats respectful introductory phrases as a means of gradually reducing the required number of righteous persons for the city to be spared instead of making known frankly his real wish: that Lot and his family be spared. Adam, on the other hand, is fully as respectful and reverent as Abraham in addressing himself to God, but, more straightforwardly, he makes one clear request: a human consort to partake of the pleasures of Paradise with him.'5 Sims also sees the Fall foreshadowed as a result of the associa- tion, since Adam "too readily hearkens to his wife as Abraham did when Ishmael was conceived." " Such notions as these come dangerously close to undercutting the paradox of felix culpa in the final book, which derives precisely from fallen Adam's eleva- tion through Divine Grace to the covenantal relationship which begins with Abraham and progresses to Christ. Sims's arguments are hardly defensible, and yet no one else has considered an alternative implication of the Abraham-Adam asso- ciation in Book V. The reason for this may be that where tradi- tional Christian Biblical commentary sheds a good deal of light on Abraham's departure from Ur, stressing the patriarch's obedi- ence, faith, patience, and fortitude, qualities necessary for Adam and for all Christian wayfarers, traditional exegesis of the initial verses of Genesis I8 is apparently irrelevant to Milton's account of Raphael's descent to Eden. The overwhelming majority of Christian Biblical exegetes focus their attention exclusively on the mystery of the Trinity which is foreshadowed by the visit of the angels to Abraham. Though some commentators believe Christ to be one of the three visitants, particularly since Abraham's address to a single figure " Ibid., 204. io Ibid., 203.</page><page sequence="6">416 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW (Genesis I8:3) suggests Christ's superiority to his two consorts,'7 the common consensus is that the visitors are angels who signify the mystery of the Trinity."s Martin Luther delivers the majority opinion when he states: "Something must be said about the mys- tery of the Trinity; for the ungodly Jews laugh at us because our fathers wanted to prove the Trinity from this passage, inasmuch as three men appear here, yet Abraham speaks to only one." "9 Luther concludes that the visit of the angels does not constitute proof of the doctrine of the Trinity; rather, the three angels addressed in the singular "are welcome vestiges of a doctrine which has already been proved with certainty and is well- known." 20 Rashi's Commentary, in understandably sharp contrast to tra- ditional Christian exegesis, yields no figurative interpretation of the episode; its concentration on particular details of the historical event is due primarily to the fact that for Rashi the single event is all in all, the sole reality, with neither allegorical nor typologi- cal significance. His Commentary on the initial verses of the chapter is important not only in providing a dictum which Milton seems to follow throughout Paradise Lost, but also for naming Raphael as the angel who visits Abraham at Mamre and for clearing up some of the obscurities surrounding the sociable spirit's mission: 17JOHN CALVIN, A Commentarie Upon Genesis, 378-80; JoHN DIODATI, Pious and Learned Annotations Upon the Holy Bible: Expounding the Most Difficult Places Thereof (London, 1648), 14: R.

You may know that this is so because throughout this section it [Scripture] mentions them in the plural - 'and they ate' (v. 8), 'and they said unto him' (v. 9) - whilst with regard to the overthrow of Sodom it says, 'For I cannot do anything' and that 'I will not overthrow the city.'

Andrew Willet takes time out from his extensive consideration of the figurative meaning of the verse to reject the Commentary summarily: Neither can it be certainly affirmed, that these three men were the three angels, Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, as some of the Hebrewes: the first, the messenger to Abraham, the other appointed for the destruction of Sddom, and Raphael for Lotts deliverance.23 Willet is hardly likely to have influenced Milton, since, aside from rejecting this interpretation, he confuses the function of each angel, failing to connect Raphael with Abraham.

He, like Luther, refers to the ridicule which comes from Jewish quarters: Aben-Ezra &amp; Hebraei alii Christianos rident, quod ex angelis faciant Deum cum mox sequatur capitulo decimo nono, duos A tertio abisse ad Lothum. Ipsi interim statuunt, fuisse tres angelos, tribus negociis expediendis simul missos: Unum Michaelem ad nunciddum Sarae partum futurum: Alterui Raphaelem ad sanandum Abrahamii A cir- cumcisionis vulnere, &amp; ad Lothum servandum: Tertium Gabrielem ad evertendam Sodomam. Sed unde ipsi commentum suum probabunt, cum duos pariter Lothum eduxisse, Sodomam vero non ab angelo, sed A Jehova coelitus fulmine sulphureo eversam esse historia do- ceat? 24 In this reference, which occupies only a fraction of the space devoted to the verse, Pareus rejects the Hebrew interpretation, arguing that Sodom was destroyed by the sulphurous lightning- bolt of heaven-dwelling Jehovah rather than by an angel. Pareus singles out Ibn Ezra's Commentary, though there the functions of the three angels, who remain unnamed, are different from those which appear in his reference: UTI81 tlft'm lz~m m4=111 mnv anW ? ttin fw Mn0v? .tl a . . Three angels: one came to inform Sarah, and two went to Sodom, one to destroy it and the second to rescue Lot. It seems reasonable to assume, then, that Rashi's Commentary is the source of Pareus' reference. Aside from naming Raphael as the angel who comes to heal Abraham, it states that one angel does not carry out two commissions, providing a cogent argu- ment for this opinion based solely on textual analysis. The latter dictum is less relevant to Book V than to XI (11. 221-23), where the angel Michael's action of dividing his heavenly entourage into two camps, one to "seize / Possession of the Garden; he alone, / To find where Adam shelter'd took his way," is evidence of the Princely Hierarch's attention to propriety.

The vividness of the poet's depiction of occur- rences which bear a great resemblance to those in the eighteenth chapter of Genesis is largely a matter of his having before him clear and distinct impressions of an event which most Christians would have recognized as significant figuratively, yet which en- joys an incontrovertible reality. Nevertheless, its importance as a thing in itself is rather minimal; in St. Augustine's commentary, for example, the actual visit of the three personages all but dis- solves in the signification of the mystery of the Trinity. Rashi's Commentary is useful for Milton precisely because the poet ex- ploits the literal account of Genesis I8:1-16 in order to equip himself with details. Most important, some of our inferences from Rashi's Com- mentary may shed light on an obscure area in Book V. Critics who find Milton's God stern and inflexible do not consider His response to Adam and Eve's hymn of praise and fidelity, which seems in excess of the facts - indeed, almost sentimental. It is true that Eve has been disturbed by her Satanically-induced dream, and her narration of the details of the dream does not please Adam; but she is after all "cheered" (1. I29); and fol- lowing the hymn the couple "firm peace recover'd soon and wonted calm" (1. 2 1o). God looks down on His children in their happy employment and is moved to pity them: "Them thus imploy'd beheld / With pity Heav'n's high King, and to him call'd / Raphael" (11. 219-21). Although God's response is doubtless due chiefly to His knowledge of imminent temptation, He sends Raphael on his mission not only to warn Adam of future danger but also to repair past harm caused by the dream, this despite the apparent recovery of the happy pair. God speaks to His messenger: Raphael, said hee, thou hear'st what stir on Earth Satan from Hell scap't through the darksome Gulf Hath rais'd in Paradise, and how disturb'd This night the human pair . .. (11. 224-27)</page><page sequence="10">420 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Indeed, God's choice of Raphael, whose name means "medicine of God" ("God's healing"), suggests that our first parents are not yet completely recovered from the night's disturbance. Eve has been the victim of an assault which, as H. V. S. Ogden notes, is "none the less real because it is mental not physical." 26 One must beware, however, of attaching a stigma to Eve on the basis of Satan's manipulation of "the Organs of her Fancie." The poet emphasizes the fact that Eve's psychic disturbance is the result of Satan's use of force; the "adversarie" desires to "taint / Th'animal spirits that from pure blood arise / Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure" (IV, 804-06). Now Satan is free to tempt Adam and Eve with "deceit and lies," just as they are free to resist his temptations (III, 98-99). God has, however, clearly stated to the Son (III, 80-92) what He now tells Raphael (V, 242-43), that the virtue and righteousness of our first parents does not depend on their successful resistance of Satan's force. In the Commentary of Rashi cited earlier, Raphael's function is seen to be the healing of Abraham's wound of circumcision. Although nothing significant can be gained from a comparison between a nightmare and a circumcision, a brief examination of the Commentary on Genesis 18:1 i, which touches upon the occa- sion for Raphael's visit to Abraham, reveals that a patient's distress is hardly evidence of his sinfulness. Speaking to the question of the immediate proximity of the episode at Mamre to the apparently irrelevant account of Abraham's circumcision (Genesis 17:24-27), Rashi states that Raphael comes three days after the circumcision to heal the wound of the ninety-nine year old patriarch: And the Lord appeared to him - to visit the sick. Rabbi Hamma the son of Hanina said: it was the third day after his circumcision and the Holy One, blessed be He, came and inquired after the state of his health.

OGDEN, The Crisis of PARADISE LOST Reconsidered, Philological Quarterly XXXVI (I957), IIf.</page><page sequence="11">CELESTIAL ENTERTAINMENT 421 Abraham's physical wound, to restore Eve's damaged spirits suggests that Eve's dream is not cogent proof of her susceptibility to Satan's flattery or of her already fallen nature. Abraham's physical discomfort certainly carries no stigma, and the spirit who entertains and heals the patriarch performs a similar func- tion for our first parents. Moreover, by keeping alive the memory of Eve's disturbing dream, the mission of the healing spirit is seen as a dramatically plausible occurrence rather than as a ran- dom intrusion. Millicent Bell maintains that Eve is fallen before she eats the forbidden fruit, and her search for a bridge between inno- cence and corruption in the poem takes her back to Eve's dream: Even a contemporary reader would have felt the ominousness of the incident. Eve sleeps 'with Tresses discompos'd, and glowing Cheek,' and wakes in a state of intense excitement. Adam tells her soothingly that 'evil into the mind of God or Man/May come and go, so unapprov'd and leave/No spot or blame behind' (V, I17-119). But we cannot believe it, knowing already the outcome of the story.27 Mrs. Bell's statement that Adam's consoling words are not be- lievable for us, since we know "already the outcome of the story," implies that Eve is already fallen because she will fall later. To maintain that Eve is originally guilty because she has been dis- turbed by Satan's assault is to read the dream as a dead meta- phor. The poet takes pains to discourage such a reading by making Raphael an agent of comfort and not of forgiveness. The mere presence of so illustrious a guest as Raphael constitutes the first formally festive event for Eve. Moreover, the angel as well as the poet are lavish in their blessings and emphasize Eve's virtue as well as her beauty. Even a critic who seems oblivious to the Abraham-Adam relationship and to the angel's possible role as a restorer of spirits observes that "Raphael leads Adam and Eve back to grandeur and responsibility toward the end of Book V," 28 though he offers no explanation for their elevation.

(388-91) It is quite possible that Milton chooses to transform certain details which appear in Rashi's Commentary regarding the angels' courtesy to Sarah. Rashi's entire comment may be read as an answer to the tacitly understood question of the angel's appar- ent ignorance of Sarah's whereabouts: "And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent" (Genesis 18:9). Rashi's Commentary states: x8'8 Ifti rnIrl 1=8r I mat? nvirl? 'f n 14 m wy-7... 14?8 Iftins And they said unto him - The ministering angels knew, indeed, where our mother Sarah was but they asked this question to call attention to her modesty and so to endear her all the more to her husband. R. Jose the son of Haninah stated that they inquired where she was in order to send her the wine-cup of blessing. A good deal of praise for Mother Sarah derives from Christian Biblical commentary on this verse as well as from Rashi, but only the Commentary sees the angels' speech as the source of praise. After all, Abraham's answer emphasizes rather more overtly Sarah's retiring disposition. Martin Luther, for example, draws from Abraham's answer a lesson for all women, contrasting the matriarch's saintliness with the inborn levity, garrulousness, and fidgetiness of most women.29 Henry Ainsworth, commenting on Abraham's answer, notes that "it is a vertue for women, to be keepers at home." 30 Gervase Babington avails himself of an ' LUTHER, Works, vol. 3, 2oof.

The first part of Rashi's Commentary is in perfect accord with Milton's conception of the ideal woman, whose submissiveness is the result of a nature formed "For softness and sweet attractive grace." The poet describes Eve standing before Raphael as "Virtue proof, no thought infirm / Alter'd her cheek" (V, 384- 85), and her appearance prompts Raphael to greet her as the angel of the Annunciation greeted "blest Mary, second Eve." In the Commentary as well as in Paradise Lost, the angel rather than the husband utters words of praise. The second part of the Commentary suggests the courtesy of the angels, who propose a sort of celestial toast to Sarah. Though Milton's image of cups crowned with wine may derive ultimately from Homer's Iliad or Virgil's Georgics, the Commentary may well account for its position in this scene which adumbrates the feast at Mamre: Meanwhile at Table Eve Minister'd naked, and thir flowing cups With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, Then had the Sons of God excuse to have been Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts Love unlibidinous reign'd. (443-49) This image of submissive Eve, clothed only in innocence, bring- ing wine to her husband and her guest, incorporates both aspects of Rashi's Commentary, though the poet may have laid more stress on the fact of her submissiveness. It is perhaps significant that his Eve is the dispenser rather than the receiver of the cup of blessing. Nevertheless, Eve's appearance at the feast does elicit a blessing - from the poet himself, who rejoices in her n BABIN;TON, Works, 56.</page><page sequence="14">424 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW innocence deserving of paradise and who finds her attractiveness so compelling that an angel could almost be excused his passion. The woman who demands nothing receives everything from this poet. To maintain an absolute critical position on a passage in Para- dise Lost usually proves to be indefensible, for the poem is strong enough to stand up to numerous divergent interpretations. Never- theless, ignorance of the Abraham-Adam relationship can lead to a rather serious misreading of Raphael's descent to Eden. In an intensive reading of this episode, Thomas Kranidas stresses its comedic aspect. A good deal of the humor derives from the dis- parity between Adam and Eve and their guest, and Kranidas im- plies that the relative pomposity and inefficiency of the former tinges our laughter with ridicule: Adam's first words in this 'scene' are 'Haste hither Eve' (1. 308). After the tremendous flight of Raphael, speed with dignity, these words are more than gently humorous. We are in the world of man's speech, man's limited imagination. Apart from the excessive urgency, there is understatement, too, and, at the end, a kind of bumbling in the sound of 'Morn/Ris'n on mid-noon.' 32 Kranidas suggests further that our first parents' excessive con- cern with the preparation of food (11. 313-37) elicits our smiles; we are made temporarily superior to these "newlyweds": Inadequate awe; a sense of exaggerated activity; the somewhat pompous generosity ("and by disburd'ning grows/More fruitful"); Eve's rustic but elegant Epicureanism; and the sententious and in- tense efficiency of the newlywed - all are here in remarkable comic variety and unity.33 One may infer from such a reading of the scene the author's unfamiliarity with the resemblance of Adam to Abraham. This excludes him - at least so far as this episode is concerned - from the rich ground of Christian and Jewish tradition which sees Abraham as an exemplar of hospitality, a tradition which re- inforces Scripture itself. On the occasion of the angels' visit, "Abraham hastened into the tent, unto Sarah, and said: Make 82 KRANIDAS, The Fierce Equation, 147. 88 Ibid., 148.</page><page sequence="15">CELESTIAL ENTERTAINMENT 425 ready quickly (lit. "hasten") three measures of fine meale, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth" (Genesis 18:6). In light of this verse, Adam's words, "Haste hither Eve," become rather less inappropriate than Kranidas suggests. Northrop Frye's study of Paradise Lost contains an observation on Raphael's visit to Eden which reads almost as self-parody. The great synthesizer remarks that The colloquy of Raphael and Adam is a Socratic dialogue without irony, a symposium with unfermented wine, a description of an ideal commonwealth ending with the expulsion of undesirables, and (for Adam is the king of men) a cyropaedia, or manual of royal disci- pline.34 Professor Frye might have added that the episode in Book V is an enchiridion on angelic entertainment, for which Milton would have found Abraham's behavior useful. Abraham is the embodiment of hospitality in Rashi's Commentary, which states that God brought out the sun (Genesis 18:1) in order that the patriarch not be bothered by company, though when He saw how Abraham was grieved that no travellers came He sent the three angels. Even more significant is the fact that in Christian tradition the Biblical verse advocating hospitality - "Bee not forgetfull to entertaine strangers, for thereby some have enter- tayned Angels unaware" (Epistle to the Hebrews 13:2) - is read as an allusion to Abraham's hospitality at Mamre.35 Adam's verbal echo of Abraham, then, is not to be read as a sort of generic satire on man - "man's speech, man's limited imagina- tion" -but rather as an indication of the superior hospitality and graciousness of our first parents. Moreover, when one considers the poet's emphasis on Adam's graciousness and hospitality in this episode, one cannot help re- membering the rather different reception which Satan received at the hands of his close relations earlier in the poem. The angelic visit, like the creation account and so many other episodes in Paradise Lost, has its own infernal parody.

The angel watches the world from the gate of heaven: From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, Star interpos'd, however small he sees, Not unconform to other shining Globes, Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crown'd Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes Imagin'd Lands and Regions in the Moon . . . Down thither prone in flight He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Sky Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing Now on the polar winds. (V, 257-69) Raphael's majesty is heightened by his singleness of purpose. His view of the world is clear and unobstructed, and his flight to Eden is steadfast and immediate. Satan, that "flying Fiend," makes an incontrovertibly formidable appearance, though his flight differs from Raphael's in at least one important respect: Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man, Satan with thoughts inflam'd of highest design, Puts on swift wings, and towards the gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight; sometimes He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left, Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soars Up to the fiery concave tow'ring high. (II, 629-35) One may assume that Satan's wavering, restless flight is an index of his spiritual error. Raphael is recognized immediately by all who see him and is welcomed accordingly: "Straight knew him all the Bands / Of Angels under watch; and to his state, / And to his message high in honor rise" (V, 287-89). Adam's first words to him reflect proper awe: Native of Heav'n, for other place None can than Heav'n such glorious shape contain; Since by descending from the Thrones above,</page><page sequence="17">CELESTIAL ENTERTAINMENT 427 Those happy places thou hast deign'd a while To want, and honor these, voutsafe with us Two only, who yet by sovran gift possess This spacious ground, in yonder shady Bow'r To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears To sit and taste, till this meridian heat Be over, and the Sun more cool decline. (V, 361-70) Satan's first moments in strange surroundings are rather less com- fortable than Raphael's. Adam sits at the door of his tent waiting for travellers; Sin waits as well: "Before the Gates there sat / On either side a formidable shape . . ." (II, 648-49). The first words which Satan hears are "full of wrath": "Art thou that Traitor Angel. ... Back to thy punishment, / False fugi- tive. .. ." (II, 688, 699). Misunderstanding attends Satan in these initial moments, exacerbating his condition. In virtually all of these details, the ironic disparity between the reception of angel and fiend depends greatly on the extent to which Adam's hospitality is recognized as virtuous. An understanding of the Abraham-Adam relationship in Book V goes far toward intensify- ing the irony of Book II. Finally, there is, as Kranidas suggests, a good deal of comedy in the "breakfast scene" in paradise, but its psychological source is not our feeling of superiority toward people being ridiculed but rather our sympathy with a genuinely beautiful and likeable human couple. Raphael is the agent of therapeutic humor, and his presence advances the recovery of Adam and Eve from the ill effects of the dream induced by Satan. I mentioned that Kranidas concludes his remarks on the scene by observing that "Raphael leads Adam and Eve back to grandeur and responsibility toward the end of Book V," 36 but he does not offer an explanation for this return. By connecting the breakfast scene with the dream that precedes it, however, one can understand that by the end of the book a complete cure has been effected. The grandeur of our first parents is a reliable sign of their recovery from psychic distress. 1 KRAANIDAS, The Fierce Equation, 154.</page></plain_text>
