IN THEAETETUM A re-examination of the anonymous Commentary on the Theaetetus,1 henceforth abbreviated K, is overdue. It may yet prove to be the most important document we possess for plotting the course of pre-Plotinian Platonism, and is by far the largest surviving portion of a pre-Plotinian commentary on a complete work of Plato. It offers us insights into the issues of the first century B.C. which are unparalleled in other extant Middle Platonist works, either because of the subject of the work and its consequent tendency to bring to mind the epistemological debates between Philo of Larissa, Antiochus of Ascalon, and Aenesidemus, or because the author, whom we may call A, is writing at a time comparatively close to those debates. Recent work in the field of Middle Platonism has found little place for K. John Dillon does not afford it a separate section in his general work The Middle Platonists,2 partly because he tries to identify A with Albinus (270-1, 289-90), partly because it is not easy to say where K belongs. John Glucker, who is well aware that the work has material of relevance to his discussion of Academici and Platonici, commits an unfortunate error in placing the work in the third century A.D.3 He believes that in doing so he is following Diels and Schubart,4 and that this date fits the school of Gaius.5 He is apparently unaware that the papyrus itself is generally agreed to belong to the second century, probably not too late in that century." The school of Gaius was active in the second quarter of the century, for the physician Galen heard an unknown pupil of Gaius in Pergamum in A.D. 143/4;' he also heard Gaius' well-known pupil Albinus during the fifties.8 The connection between the school of Gaius and K was made at a time when the Didascalicus ascribed to Alcinous and the De Platone of Apuleius were thought to be the products of that school.9 The former work was actually thought to be the work of Albinus.10 There are a number of unremarkable similarities between K, Didasc., and Apuleius, and it long seemed probable that all sprang from the same school.11 But we are now witnessing a change of heart, and Dillon has shown that Apuleius should not be connected with Gaius' circle even allowing for Didasc. being the work of Albinus,12 while John Whittaker has demonstrated that there is no good reason for SEd. H. Dibls and W. Schubart (Berliner Klassikertexte ii, 1905). 2 The Middle Platonists (London, 1977), hereafter cited as MP. 3 Antiochus and the late Academy (Hypomnemata Ivi, G6ttingen, 1978), hereafter cited as Ant., pp. 39, 219, 304. 4 But see intro. xxiv: 'Der vorliegende Kommentar zum Theitet muss, wie die Schrift lehrt, vor dem dritten nachchristlichen Jahrhundert entstanden sein.

TARRANT regarding Didasc. as Albinus' work.13 Hence it is clear that all we can reliably use as evidence for the 'School of Gaius' are a collection of fragments from the commentaries of Albinus (and possibly of Gaius himself), and a tiny six-paragraph work by Albinus known as the Prologue or Isagoge.14 There is no similarity between the Prologue and K which ought not to be regarded as commonplace. Both works are evidence of an approach to Plato through the Dialogues rather than through summaries of Platonic doctrine (contrast Didasc. and Apuleius), and both employ the traditional Middle Platonic rEhAo9 of 6tolotats 8OEw.15 Both employ the term cvawuLK0 vvota in the context of the Platonic theory of 'recollection'.1" But against this should be set the fact that the Prologue proposes Alc. I, Phd., and Tim. as a normal introductory programme of Platonic studies, an order which conflicts with that in which A wrote his commentaries;17" Albinus fails to men- tion Tht. (along with Phdr. and Critias) in his classification of Platonic Dialogues;is Gaius and Albinus are known to have seen two levels of dogmatism in Plato,19 while A sees in Plato some of the reticence of the New Academy, towards which he leans ;20 and Albinus knows that Meno 98 a reads alt'Ta AoytauC&amp;, while A's text appears to have read atre' AoytaCoi.V21 It is thus unlikely that either Gaius or Albinus wrote K 13 'Parisinus Graecus 1962 and the writings of Albinus', Phoenix 28 (1974), 320 ff. and 450 ff. 14 Platonis Opera, ed. C. Fr. Hermann (Teubner), vi. 147-51. Page references to Prol., to the Didascalicus, and to the anon. Prolegomena ad Platonis Philosophiam from this volume will be given with an H. 15 7. 14-20; cf. Didasc. 28 (p. 181. 16-182. 7 H) and Apul. De Plat. 23 (p. 126. 4 ff. Thomas) in addition to Albinus Prol. 5 (p. 150. 10 H), 6 (p. 151. 4 H). The doctrine is early enough to appear in Arius-Eudorus (Stob. Ecl. 2, p. 49. 8 Wachsmuth), ordinary enough to appear at D.L. 3. 78. 16 46. 43, 47. 44 ff.; cf. 23. 7, 47. 20; cf. Prol. 6 (p. 150. 21-3 H). 17 Before writing K, A had written on Tim. (35. 10-12) and Symp. (70. 10-12), and he promises a work on Phd. at 48. 7-11; the work is probably not yet written, though it may be that the student who reads Tht. is not yet expected to have read Phd. 1s Prol. 3 (p. 148 H). While there is a possibility that omissions have been caused by problems of transmission (see O. Schissel, Hermes 62 (1931), 215-26), Albinus may have deliberately passed over Phdr., for he adhered to the view that the rational soul alone is immortal (Proclus, In Tim. 3. 234. 9-18 Diehl), and it is very difficult to reconcile this view with the myth of Phdr. (245 c ff.). One doubts whether he saw the work as being spurious, for he quoted 237 bc at p. 147. 8 (though without naming the work); but it is possible that he regarded both Phdr. and Tht. as educationally unsound. Neither work would seem to have been prominent in the programme of education which he sketches at sections 5-6. 19 Proclus, In Tim. 1. 340. 23 ff. (Diehl). 20 His treatment of the Academics at 6. 29-7. 14, 54. 43-55. 7, and 70. 12-26 shows that he considered Academic 'scepticism' as a device for attacking Stoics, etc., which was used in a manner consistent with common sense and 4vipyIEa (70. 21-6). It did not lead to ro7To , nor preclude their having 66y?ara (in a weak sense, 54. 43-55. 7). Moreover, A shows genuine interest in Pyrrhonism (61. 10-63. 40). For A's use of Philo of Larissa's alleged criterion of vdapyea see 5. 34-6 (cf. Numenius fr. 8 Leemans = 28 des Places, Aenes. in Phot. cod. 212, 170a37-8, Cic. Ac. 2.34, K 70. 21-6, Glucker Ant. 72-4, and the author's 'Philo of Larissa on agreement and the self-evident', Dionysus 5 (1981), 66 ff.). A's brand of 'scepticism' is perhaps similar to that which he fathers on Plato, e.g. 58. 36-9: o0 , ydp cEral tot obr 0 EbE680s avyXwppiaat oUrT TaAlOEis &amp; avoaat, or 59. 12-21, where Plato is said to avoid open demonstration of his views, but to reveal his pleasure imperceptibly to the familiar reader. 21 This was originally held to make A's identification with Albinus difficult (Diels/Schubart, intro. xxxiii), but Dillon rightly does not think the point conclusive (MP, p. 271). The phrase appears wrongly in K 3. 2-3 and 15. 21-3, correctly at Prol. 6 (150. 27 H). If the Meno, and this passage especially, were not crucial to A's epistemology, one might dismiss the mistake as a slip of memory, but it is more likely that some deliberate 'emendation' is responsible. Another such alteration to the end of Meno (99e6) occurs at Clem. Strom. 5. 83. 4 (Stahlin), cf. 84. 1-2. Antiochus' theory that vois is the cause of all cognitive activity (Cic. Ac. 2. 30) may be behind both emendations, voiS being both the alr'a AoyaCoipo which converts right opinion to knowledge</page><page sequence="3">THE DATE OF ANON. IN THEAETETUM 163 and, in view of the failure of Albinus to mention Tht. in his classification, one doubts whether they would have commented on the work at all. A further point against associating K with the school of Gaius is that Galen, whose Platonism was learnt from pupils of Gaius, regards the descriptions 'Academic' and 'Platonic' as referring to two quite separate groups of philosophers, the former being close to the Sceptics, while the latter are dogmatists.2 He himself defends the dogmatist cause against Favorinus the 'Academic', and has a tendency to regard the Timaeus as a work of second-degree dogmatism, as Gaius and Albinus had done.23 It seems unlikely, then, that K is the product of the school of Gaius, and our next task is to inquire into the possibility that some other known Platonist of the second century A.D. wrote it. We may rule out Plutarch on grounds of style; there is no commentary on Tht. in the Lamprias Catalogue; and he gives a different, though perhaps related, view of Socratic 'midwifery' from that of K.24 We may add that Plutarch never, in extant works, refers to any philosopher as 'Platonic',25 though the term is part of A's working vocabulary. Platonic commentaries were written by Calvenus Taurus, head of a Platonic circle at Athens frequented by Aulus Gellius.2" It seems that he commented upon the Gorgias as well as the ever-popular Timaeus. I find nothing to indicate any interest in epistemology or Tht. in Taurus. His commentary on the Timaeus must have been a weightier affair than K,27 and there are difficulties in reconciling his ethics with those of K.28 Atticus, another Platonic commentator who worked on Phdr. as well as Tim.,29 is even less likely to be A. His floruit of A.D. 176-80 puts him rather late, especially if he worked outside Egypt.30 He shows no sign of interest in logic and epistemology such as one might expect from one who wrote on Tht.,31 and his anti-Aristotelian and the initial divine impulse towards right opinion and virtue. Though A seems to interpret Meno 98 ab correctly at col. 3, he may be using a text transmitted via Antiochus' school. 22 An. Morb. 92 clearly views the Academics as a different kind of philosopher from the Platonics, closer to the Sceptics (ibid. 60), as also in Opt. Doctr. (aimed at Favorinus). 23 He took the work's theories on the human body and its ailments seriously enough for both a commentary on the medical passages and a Plato-based attack on some self-styled Platonists (Scr. Min. ii. p. 64. 19 ff. Muiller). But where it suits him Galen will remind one that Plato did not think everything in Tim. to be certain, Plac. 9. 794-5. 24 Mor. 999c ff., on which see below p. 166. 25 See Glucker, Ant. p. 209, who points out that only the spurious De Mus. (1131 f.) refers to 'Platonics', who are in any case the immediate followers of Plato, not a later sect. 26 On Taurus see Dillon, MP, pp. 237-47, H. D6rrie, 'L. Kalbenos Tauros', Kairos 1-2 (1973), 24-35. We are given greater insight into Taurus as a person than as a philosopher in Gellius; for the commentary on Gor. see N.A. 7. 14. 5. 7 Compare Dillon's comments on its remains at MP, pp. 246-7 'fairly detailed exegesis' with those on K at 270: 'maintains a level of stupefying banality'. 28 Dillon, MP, pp. 240-2, makes much use of Gellius N. A. 12. 5. 7, where we see a rather Antiochian emphasis on olKdELaWg and rTt rpcrTa KaT '6atlv. But note that K rejects the former as a suitable basis for justice, cols. 6-7. 29 For some fragments see J. Baudry's collection (Paris, 1931); from passages in Proclus, In Tim., we learn of his exegesis of Tim. and Phdr. (the latter at 3. 277. 15 Diehl). 30 But there is no evidence for his presumed Athenian connections, and he has 'a rather curious name to be borne by an Athenian' (Dillon, MP, p. 248). I assume that brrotvw?5Lara were not designed for wide circulation, judging both from the word itself and from their uselessness to persons not possessing a text. Their obvious place was within the philosophical school, until such time as fame demanded their wider availability. 31 Extant remains of Middle Platonists have been partly shaped by the interests of Neo- platonists and Christians who preserve them. But Atticus' division of philosophy shows clearly that ethics and theology-directed metaphysics/physics were his main concerns, while logic was merely a tool (Eus. P.E. 509b = fr. 1 Baudry).</page><page sequence="4">164 H. TARRANT stance, religious motivation, and obsession with points of language count against identification with A.32 Harpocration's Commentary on Plato in 24 books could have contained an interpretation of Tht.,33 but we know nothing of any epistemological views which he may have had. His interests seem to have been centred on theology and psychology, and on Platonic works which discuss these subjects. As a pupil of Atticus he seems too late to have written K. In Severus we find a commentator who showed some interest in epistemology but significantly, his views on the subject are in conflict with Tht. He held that the soul had a single critical faculty, A6yos, which employed vr'aTls as well as aLaor0ots as its instruments.34 This seems difficult to reconcile with Tht. 184c-186e, where the mind apprehends non-sensibles direct, without the assistance of any organ analogous to the senses. The theory of Severus is inspired by the two-world ontology of the Timaeus, and just as he wants to place a single genus (Tr oT) over the sensible and intelligible obotat,35 so he wants to place a single cognitive faculty over sensation and intellection. But K's theory appears to be inspired almost exclusively by Tht. and Meno, where the two-world ontology is least in evidence, and where no attempt is made to subordinate epistemology to ontology. Severus' date is most unclear, though Dillon's guess would make him rather late to have written K.36 Finally, we must point out that Numenius differs very much from A in holding the view that the Academic sceptics had deserted Plato's teachings.37 There are irreconcilable differences between the two writers on ozbla, for Numenius could not possibly accept that obot'at could be in flux.38 Similar objections presumably apply in the case of Numenius' pupil Cronius.39 Of second-century Platonists not known to have commented on the Dialogues we may mention Maximus Tyrius, Nicostratus, and the author of Didasc. Maximus was a popular philosopher, not a scholar; no reader of his Orations would associate him with K. Nicostratus is known mainly for his pitiful attacks on Aristotle's Categories,40 and, though A generally treats other schools sensibly and sympathetically, I see no means of finally excluding his candidature. The author of Didasc., however, can be distinguished from A through an examination of their respective approaches to epistemology. The extensive chapter on epistemology at Didasc. 4 (pp. 154. 8-156. 20 Hermann) draws on material from a variety of Dialogues, as well as from non-Platonic sources; weight is given to Tim. 28a, Phil. 38b-40a, and the myth of Phdr.41 The wax-tablet 32 The anti-Aristotelian elements are patent, as is the religious motivation (cf. Dillon, MP, p. 253: 'the general tone is one of furor theologicus'). For his linguistic endeavours (Proclus In Tim. 1. 284. 13) and other features of his commentaries see Dillon, MP, p. 257. 33 See J. Dillon, 'Harpocration's Commentary on Plato: fragments of a Middle Platonic Commentary', Calif. Studs. in Class. Ant. 4 (1971), 125 ff. 34 Proclus In Tim. 1. 255. 5 ff. (Diehl). 35 ibid. 1. 227. 13 ff. (Diehl). 36 I know of no evidence that could assist us to fix a date. 37 He wrote a polemical work against the New Academy, partially preserved by Eusebius (P.E. 14. 727 a ff. = frr. 1-8 Lang = 24-8 des Places). 38 As can be seen from his whole approach to r o'yae6v, asking first rt T yv, then fiercely dismissing the claims of body and matter (frr. 11-13 Lang = 2-4a des Places). 39 Cronius seems to have followed Numenius closely; his scant remains follow those of Numenius in Lang's collection (Brussels, 1937). 40 Simpl.

IN THEAETETUM 165 section of Tht. 191c-195b is used at 154. 35-155. 12, interpreted with an eye on the Philebus passage. The view of the criterion St' oi at 154. 11-18 is not easily reconciled with Tht. 184c ff., particularly 185 de. Certainly Didasc. does not lead one to suppose that its author thought Tht. to be the major Platonic work on the criterion, as the majority of Platonics in A's time believed (see col. 2 and fr. 4). A himself had been prepared to admit that Tht. indulged in considerable discussion of the criterion (col. 2), and would not himself have ignored its contribution as Didasc. does at 154. 10-18; he uses the terms 'criterion St' o~' and 'criterion 0' (= t' oi5 ?)42 in a manner barely reminiscent of Didasc. More striking than the way in which Didasc. uses Tht. is its neglect of Meno, a work well known to A. Didasc. 4 fails to use the term avd iv'rats,43 and the binding of right opinion by a/lraq AoytcL6'S (98a) is not mentioned: this is particularly important, since A believed that this passage held the key to the question raised by Tht.44 Another significant difference is the use of the term E7Ttinr15 r7ThA-, 155. 28-9, which is identified here with the 'natural notions' and with latent 'memory' of the Ideas. A regards 'simple knowledge' as the subject of Tht., but he does not rush to identify it with either natural notions or recollected Ideas.45 It is possible, however, that he did so towards the end of the work or, more likely, that he regarded the memory of the Ideas as one category of 'simple knowledge'. I believe that these points will suffice to suggest that A did not write Didasc., though similarities also exist. The very occurrence of such terms as tatrL7tj~7 7TA79, KPt7r(ptov st' ov, and ovaLKal EvvoLaL might indeed indicate some relationship between them, but I should regard Didasc. 4 as more highly developed and more closely interfused with an ontology. It bears the stamp of that second-century interest in theology, metaphysics, and the soul's extra-bodily existence which is generally lacking in K. As one compares K with the remains of second-century Platonist literature one begins to realize that the work does not belong here. Though there were many minor Platonists from that century whose views cannot be discovered, many of our arguments against identifying A with particular Platonists will have some force when applied to second-century authors in general. It should be a primary consideration that Tht. does not seem to be an important work of Plato any longer, and that the school of Gaius can apparently afford to too ordinary to affirm as much. Phil. 38b ff. is the inspiration for 154. 35 ff. and 155. 12-15 and Soph. 263e for 155. 15-17. However, there are few signs of first-hand use of the dialogues in the composition of this work. 42 A's concept of the criterion St' o4 is not evident in col. 2, but it seems likely that it is to be identified with W' KptVO?4LEV T -7TpdyLarTa at 2. 26-8. When this latter is accurate the lasting rapabox-7 of things well judged becomes knowledge. It is natural to assume that A demanded accuracy of both senses and intellect; Tht. 184-6 would allow him to think of the latter as a kind of criterion Vt' o0, apprehending things 8t' abr7?g (185e 1). Tht. 184d4 (, 't -r70oTw...amg- Oavo~EOca), however, would sanction the view that we judge through the senses but with (dat.) the mind, and, as an Academic, A is much more likely to attribute accuracy to mind than to senses (cf. Diels, Dox. 396b 17-19). Thus A's criterion through which is either both senses and mind or only senses; but in Didasc. 4 (p. 154. 12-18H) it is only A6yos UaTLK69. 43 We meet v?75/t at 4 (155. 29 H), betraying the influence of Phdr. 249c-254b, where it occurs 6 times. The more usual term avavrlGLs 9 occurs in the context of arguments for immortality at 25 (177. 37 H). 44 3. 1-7: we know P when we know &amp;td 71 P. 45 Stoic theory of common/natural notions is assimilated to Platonic recollection theory as early as Cic. T.D. 1. 57, partly becuase Plato uses EvvoLa and EvoEiv in the relevant passage of Phd. (73c8, c9, 74a6, b6, c8, dl, d9, e2, 75al1, a6 x 2, all, 76a3). Now if recollected Ideas = simple knowledge, while simple knowledge is the subject of Tht., it is odd that discussion of recollection is deferred until A's work on Phd. (48. 7-11).</page><page sequence="6">166 H. TARRANT overlook it.46 That it had once been more important I shall endeavour to show shortly, but let us recall that in A's time the work was supposed to be concerned with the criterion (2. 11-17, 21-32, fr. 4), and criteriology had once been considered one of the two supreme parts of philosophy.47 As the mechanical theories of knowledge of the Hellenistic age became less fashionable among Platonists, so the relevance of Tht. became more limited: limited to such passages as those on Socratic midwifery (148e-151 d) and the flight to the higher world (176a--d).48 One doubts whether many Middle Platonists would have thought of commenting on Tht. before they tackled Phd., as A seems to have done.49 Next one should bear in mind that the second century was a time when philosophers might call themselves 'Academics' or 'Platonics',50 but that these descriptions were not interchangeable.51 One assumes, however, that A includes himself among the 'Platonics' (2. 11, fr. 4), while he obviously has sympathy for the Academic sceptics.52 If forced to choose between the two terms, then he would have elected to be called 'Academic'.53 We can only point to two second-century philosophers who would have welcomed such a description, Plutarch and Favorinus. Glucker properly allows that a few of their followers may have adopted such a name,54 and indeed there is much common ground between A and Plutarch.55 But if we assume a direct relationship between A and Plutarch, then I think that A must be placed first. Both tackle the reason why 'Socrates' is banned by the God from conceiving wisdom (Tht. 150c, Mor. 999c ff., K cols. 54-9), and both use Socrates' attribution of his infertility to God's intervention as a clear sign that he is not speaking with his customary irony. But A moves in a world where many believe this passage to be a case of irony, and he makes his point simply and forcibly as a result.56 Plutarch, however, is able to dismiss the 46 For its omission from Albinus' classification and programme of study see above, p. 162 and n. 18. D.L. 3. 62 speaks of teachers who had begun with Tht., but this could have been well before the time of D.L. (or his source). Tht. actually comes seventh in a list of eight works with which teachers of Plato had begun, so that teachers who used it first were either not recent or not important. Clearly semi-sceptics are more likely to have used it than dogmatists. 47 Antiochus at Ac. 2. 29; but others of his time surely agreed. 48 Socratic 'midwifery' is discussed by Plut. Mor. 999c ff. and Max. Tyr. Or. x. 4a-h; see also Philo Alex. Her. 247, Mut. 144, and the 'maieutic' type of dialogue at Albinus Prol. 3 (148. 36 H), 6 (150. 34 H). Lines 176a-d are well known from the time of Eudorus (Stob. Ecl. 2. 49. 8 Wachsmuth) and Philo Alex. Fug. 63, 82, etc. (see n. 15). The wax-tablet section is known to Philo Alex. (Deus 43, Her. 181, Mut. 212), and influences Plut. frr. 215 h, 217 j (Sandbach, Loeb), Didasc. 4 (154. 35-155. 12 H). Galen Plac. 7. 631 is influenced by 184 b-186 e. 49 See above, n. 17. 50 For these terms see Glucker Ant. pp. 206-25, with my review (Prudentia 12 (1980), 109-18). 51 See above, n. 22. 52 See above, n. 20. 53 This follows from (a) his sympathies (see n. 20), and (b) his One-Academy theory (55. 2-7): in supposing himself to follow Plato he must also suppose that he follows later Academics. 54 See Glucker, Ant. p. 292; on p. 293 he notes that Galen refers to no Academic sect late in life, giving the impression that it had died out. 55 One recalls the mild Academic attitude which Plut. adopts in Comm. Not., where he tries to show that it is not the Academics who overturn KOLVail EvvoLaL, 6t0oAoyla, and E.va'pyLta (on the connection between these terms see part 2 of my article cited in n. 20). Note Plutarch's distrust of 'private notions' (1062a, cf. K 46. 34). Both authors see 'recollection' as important, and both apparently discussed it in relation to Phd. (Plut. frr. 215-17 = Olymp. In Phd. p. 155. 24 ff. Norvin, cf. K 48. 7-11). Plutarch's view of Socratic midwifery is close enought to K to attract five references to K in H. Cherniss' notes to Q.P. i (Loeb, 1976). 56 K 58. 39-59. 2 uses Tht. 151 c7-d3 to refute those who detect ElpwvEla in the midwifery passage. The dogmatist view of Tht. was threatened by phrases such as 5yov6~ El L 00laS</page><page sequence="7">THE DATE OF ANON. IN THEAETETUM 167 irony theory more casually, adding a new aspect to the argument, but clouding the issue in the process.57 It seems to me that he is developing a point which has now been established. Then there is the absence from K of any sign of second-century obsession with theology or with the disembodied soul. Even the doctrine of recollection, which is found relevant to Tht. (cols. 47-8), does not receive a lengthy discussion; the question is deferred until a work on Phd.58 Nor is there any sign that the author was preoccupied with Platonic metaphysics. Thus his main concerns are no more second-century than Hellenistic. Fourthly, Khas failed to agree with second-century Platonist epistemology wherever we have been able to compare it. Above all it does not try to derive its theory of cognition from Tim., as do Severus and Didasc.,59 nor from Rep. 6-7.60 He is closest to Albinus Prol. 6, Maximus Or. 10, and Plutarch in 'Olympiodorus'.61 We proceed now from arguments against a second-century date to evidence for an earlier one. Here the background to K and the author's aims and tactics will be important. The work gives details of the normal ways of viewing Tht. as a whole, and A is constantly trying to establish his own view that the work is about 'simple and uncompounded knowledge'.62 Thrasyllus, writing in the first half of the first century A.D., was able to subtitle Tht. On Knowledge (D.L. 3. 58). Since his edition of the dialogues, in the famous tetralogies, was to become standard, one wonders whether any commentator after his time would have needed to spend time establishing that knowledge is the subject of Tht., particularly when this is so obviously the case. Admittedly A was trying to show that Tht. concerned a particular type of knowledge, but his principal opposition (ol 1TAEIovUSg 1-v HAraTWVLKJv, fr. 4) said that the work was on the criterion (cf. 2. 11-17); a second group of opponents thought that it concerned those things of which there was no knowledge, contrasting it with the Sophist, which was alleged to concern things of which there is knowledge (2. 32-9). There is no suggestion that anybody thought Tht. to be about a different kind of knowledge from that proposed by A. Accordingly one must assume that A writes before, or very shortly after, Thrasyllus. A pre-Thrasyllan date is also indicated by (150c4), which seemed to picture a sceptic 'Socrates'. The dogmatist resource was to appeal to Elpwvla, and K answers by showing that 'Socrates' makes no attempt to be modest in this passage, since he likens himself to a God (a) in respect of his EivoLa, and (b) in respect of his not accepting falsity nor hiding truth. Since A saw likeness to God as the foundation of virtue (7. 14-20), such a claim to likeness could show no modesty. Plutarch also sees use of God's name as a sign of arrogance rather than ElpwvELa, quoting 151 c5-d 3, the very passage used by K: as if he remembered that he had seen the passage used to refute the modesty theory. "5 Note 999c: o0 y&amp;p ElpwvEv6L Lv6O yE Kai rralwv ...Without Kai 7maiwv the passage would argue, like K, that to call upon God's support for one's practice is hardly a sign of modesty. But with these words it emphasizes instead that one does not call upon a God unless one is serious. 58 48. 7-11, and see n. 17 above. 59 Severus in Proc. In Tim. 1. 255. 5 ff.

Note here that my argument is unaffected by R. G. Hoerber's theory that the secondary titles of the dialogues antedate Thrasyllus. K seems unaware of the existence of any established tradition relating to a secondary title of Tht. In any case Hoerber can only produce evidence of the earliness of afew such titles, and even then they need not be official titles (see Hoerber, 'Thrasyllus' Platonic canon and the double titles', Phronesis 2 (1958), 10-20). Indeed K 48. 10 refers to Phd. by its long-established secondary title.</page><page sequence="8">168 H. TARRANT A's failure to attribute Tht. to a particular category of Platonic Dialogue during his introduction.63 If one asks the question 'When did Platonists regard Tht. as a discussion of the criterion?', one arrives at a similar conclusion. It seems clear that Tht. was not regarded as an authoritative Platonic essay on criteriology at Didasc. 4 or in Galen.64 Even Plutarch's extant works pay little attention to Tht. as a source for thoughts on the criterion. Criteriology was not itself a favourite Middle Platonic issue, so why should a Middle Platonist have defied the obvious and claimed that it was the subject of Tht.? Those who did so must have been especially concerned with the subject and with Plato's views upon it. A himself is concerned with it: the subject of knowledge necessarily involves consideration of the criterion (2. 21-3), and the insignificant words os yE vvvt kaLvE-raL (Tht. 151 e 2) give rise to an extended discussion of the Pyrrhonist rejection of all Hellenistic criteria in favour of the phenomenon. It is in fact a faithful picture of Aenesideman scepticism,65 and to judge from Sextus (PH. 1. 222) there may also be a reference to Aenesidemus' aporetic view of Plato at 54. 38-43.66 63 A's introduction is historical, and seems to deal chiefly with Protagoras. But to judge from Albinus' Prologos (and from D.L. 3. 49 ff.) Thrasyllus' activities had generated much interest in the arrangement and classification of dialogues. The anonymous author of P. Oxy. 3219 (ed. M. Haslam, XLV, pp. 29-39) shares interests with the source of D.L. 3. 52-6 (see Haslam's notes), and would presumably have been interested in classification, while Didasc. 6 (p. 158. 24 H) shows awareness of the classifications; anon. Prol. in Plat. Phil. 17 ff. shows interest. One suspects that A's phrase v rrais ?nr(TaaEUV (59. 7, 13) would have read Ev -rogs (rq-rrrTLKO9 8&amp;aA'6yOLt if it had post-dated Thrasyllus. 64 Galen's criterion is dafOrqai 7rE Kali v0rlats 9 vapy7'g (Plac. 9. 778 et saepe). 65 61. 15-46. For Aenesidemus' use of the OaLv6w vov see D.L. 9. 78, 106; also S.E. Math. 8. 215-16. The Pyrrhonist principle at 61. 12 (ovi&amp;v v 7L9 KaOoptLULKwS&amp; 8oy0arULot) occurs at D.L. 9. 71, and may be linked with Aenesidemus on the basis of D.L. 9. 106 (obEsv 6pitEL 8oyta7TLKwC9). oM3 Troiro 8oyta-r7ov7ros (61. 38-9) utilizes the Aenesideman phrase o&amp; 70roiro0 (see K. Janacek, Eirene 14 (1976), 99). Though the appearance of the moment is said to be Pyrrho's criterion, Aenesidemus' interest in maintaining Pyrrhonism's difference from dogmatic philosophies is reflected in the claim that Pyrrho did not try to show that the OaLv6/evov exists, because of equal arguments to the contrary (cf. Aenes. at D.L. 9. 106: 8&amp;d rLv avrLAoylav) and his treatment of all presentations as equal (cf. Aenes. in Phot. cod. 212, 169b40 ff.). Here the term for 'equally strong' arguments (uOKpat'7s) at 61. 26 suggests that Sextus' term (aoaoOEovir) was not yet standardized, while the verb ojoLQaELV (61. 28) sounds authentic (cf. avwjal~ a in Aenes., D.L. 9. 78) but is not Sextan. 63. 1 if., on the claim that all things are relative, leads to a discussion of avvOEwpolv4Eva (63. 11-20) and Kpivov as expected from Sextus' account of the eighth Aenesideman trope (PH. 1. 135-6). Material from tropes 1, 5 (S.E. = 7 D.L.), and 6 is also present. Aenesidemus' sensation-reason dichotomy (cf. Phot. cod. 212, 169b20, S.E. Math. 8. 40) also appears. 66 I think it is wrong to accept, with U. Burkhard, Die angebliche Heraklit-Nachfolge des Skeptikers Aenesidem (Bonn, 1973), the correction made by Natorp at PH. 1. 222 (Ka7rd (rosk) .Epl...) rather than that of Heintz (Kar7 (7aV) rTEpL Mqv608o7ro KQK AlvrqaI'r-qiov) at PH. 1. 222 for several reasons. (a) Sextus cites Timon as an authority on this point (223), and it would be remarkable that he should cite others, particularly in PH where much material is unoriginal but acknowledgement is only made in a striking case of debt (e.g. to Aenes. at 1. 180). Why mention Menodotus at all (hapax in Sextus), let alone use the periphrasis ol rrpl...? Because Sextus has a arda&amp;L in mind? But why use a arda7 s as an authority rather than its single authoritative leader? One corrects a araUiU9. (b) That Aenes. elsewhere (Phot. cod. 212) points to differences between Academics and Pyrrhonians proves nothing, for the Academics in question were Philo's school. Photius' conclusion that Aenes. also overthrows Plato (170b37-9) is based on Photius' dogmatic view of Plato, and is unrelated to criticism of the Philonian school. That school is criticized because it is the school of Tubero, to whom the work is addressed (169 b 32-5). (c) The extreme view of Plato as a sceptic does make him out to be almost Pyrrhonist: K 54. 38-43 shows us that he was seen as free from all doctrine, while Prol. in Plat. Phil. 10-11 (205. 2-207. 10 H) opposes those who used the term 0EKTLK6S9 (205. 3, 11, 207. 9, 12 H), asserting</page><page sequence="9">THE DATE OF ANON. IN THEAETETUM 169 Aenesidemus was himself the product of an age when leading Academics argued about the dogmatic or aporetic nature of Platonic teaching,67 and the issue could only be settled with recourse to clear statements on the nature of the criterion within the Dialogues. It was natural, then, that they should look to Tht. as being the work most likely to supply them with Plato's thought on the issue of the criterion: one of the two most important issues of the age (Cic. Ac. 2. 29). In particular the sceptic and semi-sceptic68 factions would have used Tht., and the extant parts of the commentary give us insights as to how they did so. The section on Socratic 'midwifery' was taken to show that Socrates, and hence his follower Plato,69 gave birth to no ideas, but merely questioned the ideas of others.70 The section on the views of Protagoras (152aff.) and on flux-doctrine (152dff.) had clearly received considerable attention, and were probably taken to show that Plato's clearly attested Heraclitism (as regards the physical world) went hand in hand with the view that all sensations are relative to the perceiver." Of particular importance would have been the section in which Socrates introduces the question of dreams, sickness, and madness (157e-158e), during which he remarks upon the difficulty of determining whether we are awake or dreaming."2 But what evidence is there outside K to show that Tht. was studied by members of the sceptical Academy? Glucker refers us to the anonymous Prolegomena to Plato's Philosophy,73 which, though late, offers good evidence of a time when some people tried to have Plato classed among ot ' EKTLKOi 7rE Ka' (...) 'AKa8Gqai0LKol. Glucker hopefully tries to relate the evidence to the Academy of Arcesilaus, but one must doubt (a) whether a late Neoplatonic author would have had access to Second Academic material on such matters, and (b) whether the author would have used the term that Plato TrrpEa/3EE QKarTaAlJ-Lav (205. 4, 14, 31 H). There are strong grounds for supposing that Prol. is replying to Aenes. in particular; see below, pp. 170 ff. (d) Aenesidemus lived when it was important to establish ancient authorities for one's views; D. L. 9. 71-3 gives a list of Pyrrhonist predecessors from Homer to Plato; Aenesidemus had himself made some kind of appeal to the thought of Heraclitus (PH. 1. 210-12), which was probably part of a wider appeal to ancient authority. (e) Sextus cannot be following Aenes. in refuting the view that Plato is Pyrrhonian, since nobody prior to Aenes. could have espoused that view; if Aenes. called Plato 'sceptic', then this may have been misunderstood by Sextus as being equivalent to 'Pyrrhonist', when it in fact meant only 'prepared to look at both sides of the issue'. 67 Cic. Ac. 1. 46, 2. 15, 74; S.E. Math. 7. 141-4 (from Antiochus' Canonica?). The dispute is attested by S.E. PH. 1. 221 and D.L. 3. 51. To judge from Ac. the debate was comparatively unsophisticated around 87 B.C., but one imagines that rival claims of Philo and Antiochus to be the true followers of Plato soon gave rise to detailed quarrels over interpretation, as found in K and anon. Prol. in Plat. Phil. 10-11. 6s The Fourth Academy, or such of its members as accepted the meaningfulness of aivpyELa as well as the impossibility of certainty, along with Cicero, Plutarch, A, etc. 69 54. 31-43, on Tht. 150c6: &amp; T ro U86v EXELV Tao6v.

Of K all that is extant here is fr. 2 (on 157e-8a). But Cic. Ac. 2. 47-53, 88-9, shows that the sensations of the dreamer, drunkard, and madman were much discussed, and serious study of Tht. would quickly bring Plato'S attitude to light, supporting the sceptic view that there is no obvious difference between these and healthy sensations. 73 Ant. pp. 38-9; he claims that the ultimate source cannot be Pyrrhonian, failing to see the importance of the term ephectic in anon. Prol. L. G. Westerink, in his note on Olymp. In Phd. 6. 14, also sees the arguments as stemming from the second Academy.</page><page sequence="10">170 H. TARRANT 'OEKTLKOL, either of his own accord or as a result of reading early Academic-sceptic literature. He had earlier distinguished the followers of the New Academy from 'ephectics' (p. 202. 23-7 Hermann), and the view of Plato which he tries to refute suits the 'ephectics' better: it sees Plato as an extreme sceptic, favouring complete aKa-A7rabTla (10, p. 205. 33-9 H), no 7poUtLopLUtLOs (10, p. 205. 10-12 H), no knowledge, no teaching, only rnopla (10, p. 206. 12-13). The picture is too extreme to emanate from the Fourth Academy of Philo of Larissa and Charmadas, if not from the Second and Third Academies,7" and I strongly suspect that we have instead some arguments from Aenesidemus, who had apparently been a leading light of one extreme view of Plato, almost certainly of the sceptic view.75 The lack of credibility in such an extreme picture would not have bothered Aenesidemus, whose aim would not have been to persuade the reader so much as to counterbalance the arguments used by others to create a dogmatist picture of Plato. Nor would he be trying to paint Plato exactly as a Pyrrhonist, but rather as an ancient authority to support Pyrrhonist doubts. In particular he was probably attempting to show that Plato was 'ephectic', i.e. that he sanctioned suspension of judgement; hence the author drops any reference to the New Academy after p. 205. 4, and thereafter tries to show that Plato does not belong to the 'ephectics' (205. 11, 207. 9, 12). 'Ephectic' was the standard late Neoplatonic term for Pyrrhonist-sceptic.76 Moreover we seem to have five' tropes' of showing Plato to have been 'ephectic', recalling the activities of Aenesidemus,77 and signs of Aenesideman language.78 Since Aenesidemus had connections with the Academy, and may possibly have studied with Heraclitus of Tyre, 79his view of Plato would still probably be based on arguments previously used by tke more extreme adherents of the Academy, among whom we may place this Heraclitus (Cic. Ac. 2. 11-12). Even though the Prolegomena may be attacking a Pyrrhonist picture of Plato, it must still be assumed that much of the material derives from Academic sources ultimately. It is therefore relevant that 74 I cannot here discuss how far suspension of judgement was an ideal of Arcesilaus, but surely he did not refrain from 7poCauopLCaL'6 (205. 10-12), nor did he wish to show Plato overturning number in Tht. (205. 20 H). That anon. is not refuting Carneadean probabilists is evident from the fact that no provision had been made for grading impressions. 75 Against me see Burkhard (above, n. 66, with my reply). He fails to discuss all evidence for the sceptic view of Plato. 76 The Ephectic sect is the Pyrrhonist sect in the introductions to the Categories-commentaries of [Ammonius], Olymp., Elias, and Philopon, and probably in the lectures of Ammonius which inspired these commentaries. But Ammonius was also the likely origin of comments on the ephectic view of Plato in the late Plato-commentaries, for see Olymp. In Phd. 8. 17 (Westerink) = 51. 1-12 (Norvin): he wrote a book against the ephectic claim that Plato doubted the immortality of the soul. 77 Besides the ten famous' tropes' (D.L. 9. 87 ff.) we have the eight 'tropes' against cause-theory (S.E. PH. 1. 180). The five ways of showing Plato to be ephectic are not referred to as 'tropes', but each is numbered, and one receives the impression of a very methodical exercise in forced interpretation. There is a similarity between the fourth 'trope' here and the way in which Aenes. counters the notion of truth in S.E. Math. 8. 40. 78 Compare pp. 205. 6-7H (mrrLpp7ard rTva T l ok A 7E KL 6aUTaLK'tK) with Aenes. in Photius 169 b 39-40 (rd /LV T7LevraTL '8LTorKTWS, 7dTa a'pOUULV dvazflAwSo), cf. 170a 29/32. Compare also p. 206. 26 (rb 8tarropELv 686's arT rrps 7Tr KaTaAaflZEv) with S.E.

At D.L. 9. 116 Aenes. is said to have studied under Heraclides, for which Pappenheim (AGP 1 (1888), 37 ff.) proposed to read Heraclitus. Since many mistakes in D.L. stem from abbreviations (see J. Meyer, Diogenes Laertius and his Hellenistic Background (Hermes Einzelschriften 40 (1978)), 25-7), this would seem plausible.</page><page sequence="11">THE DATE OF ANON. IN THEAETETUM 171 Tht. has supplied the bulk of the evidence. The third argument (10, p. 205. 18-21) dealt with Tht. only, claiming that Plato abolished all definition of knowledge there, and number as well.80 It appears that 197e2-3 was used to establish that the mind was, for Plato, empty at birth (p. 205. 22-3, 206. 20). The fifth argument was equally dependent upon Tht., for Plato is alleged to have said obS&amp;v oSfa, obtSE 8' 8' 8KW 7L, 3AA &amp;%TLa ropJ2 16vov (p. 206. 12-13). This is dependent upon the 'midwifery' section, and one might single out 150c8, 150d6-7, and 149a9 as of particular relevance to the three respective claims. It is not then surprising that K says of 150c4 (&amp;yov6s~ ElLL uooL'aS): EK TOLOVTWV A'6EWV TLVES OLOVTraL 'AKas8LqLaiK tv Tv hdI wva....(54. 38-42). It thus seems clear that Tht. was an important work for those who wanted to deny Plato's acceptance of any criterion of knowledge, and that it was studied by them in relation to the concept of such a criterion. They would naturally have seen its subject as the criterion, though Aenesidemus is unlikely to have been included among the 'Platonics' who did so. But how did the dogmatists view Tht.? Few clues are available, but we may suspect the influence of Tht. in the Antiochian account of Plato's philosophy at Cic. Ac. 1. 24 and 1. 31. The account of the two basic principles of nature, rnoooiv and rdaUXOV, which together produce physical objects and perceived qualities (Ac. 1. 24), may derive from the account of sensation at Tht. 156 a-c misinterpreted along Stoic lines and presumed to be Plato's own theory of the sensible world. The interdependence of active and passive principles may likewise have been deduced from Tht. 157a4-7. More important for our present purpose is the fact that Tht. may be behind the account of the flux and unknowable nature of the physical world at 1. 31, in particular the assertion that nothing is ever unum constans or even idem ;81 one should compare Tht. 152d2-4:&amp;"v Ltv6 abr KaO avbr6 obtsv ErTLV, ob' &amp;v r7 rTpOUEL7TOLS OP 9.... (cf. 153e4-5, 157a8, 182b3-4). It seems that Plato's adherence to the flux doctrine and his distrust of the physical world and of the senses were so well known that not even Antiochus could ignore them. Instead he countered by extracting a positive theory of the physical world from the flux-section of Tht., accepting that the work was primarily concerned with objects which were opinable rather than knowable according to Plato's theory (Ac. 1. 31-2). It is no surprise, then, that K mentions a second and smaller group of 'Platonics' who said that Tht. deals with non-knowables, whereas Soph. dealt with knowables (2. 32-9). The failure of Tht. to arrive at any explanation of knowledge could thus be attributed to its preoccupation with unsuitable objects rather than to Plato's rejection of the concept of knowledge. Obviously the view that Soph. deals with knowables must come either from dogmatist interpreters or from the mildest brand of Academic-sceptic, who no longer maintained that things were all aKadTA-rl7ra in their own right (S.E. PH. 1. 235). And it seems rather improbable that even Philo s0 In his edition of anon. Prol. (Amsterdam, 1962) L. G. Westerink refers to Tht. 147d-8b, 198a-c, and 204b-e, 'none of which is really pertinent'. One might also consider 195e-6c and 199b, where Plato fails to explain miscalculations, thus raising the question of the validity of arithmetic, and 152d2, etc., where nothing is allowed to be one; when combined with 204b-e, where the whole is just the sum of the parts, the absence of one abolishes arithmetic. Aenes. had an interest in the whole-part problem (S.E. Math. 9. 337), and at Math. 10. 216-17 numbers are regarded as mere multiples of a corporeal (hence flux-prone) unit. 81 I tend to reject the et which Halm adds between unum and constans, believing that the phrase may relate to the concept Ev air' Ka6' ab76 at Tht. 152d 2, etc. Manutius' reading ne idem seems obvious; cf. K 64. 1-2: ti77siv ETvaL I7TaLOV L7I qS "r a'rTo.</page><page sequence="12">172 H. TARRANT of Larissa82 would have been bold enough to talk of the 'knowables' of Soph., seeing that his attested views on KaaA7b/Ls make no distinction between classes of things, only between the senses in which they may be apprehensible.83 We must thus assume that it was the Antiochians, still to be distinguished from the majority of the 'Platonics', who regarded non-knowables as the subject of Tht. Thus discussions about the subject of Tht. mentioned by A in col. 2 are probably not the more advanced scholastic debates of the second century A.D., but livelier and more primitive quarrels belonging to the first half of the first century B.C., in which the protagonists were Philo, Antiochus, and Aenesidemus. The term 'Platonics' found at 2. 11 and fr. 4 is a device, perhaps a new device, for referring to all sects which claimed allegiance to Plato, or possibly to all scholars of Plato, but it is not yet the term for a particular school or for a particular dogmatic type of Platonist. The term 'Academic', however, plainly refers to a follower of the New Academic tradition (54. 40-55. 7, 70. 14), even though no scepticism, in our sense of the word, was required and doctrine was permitted. If we place K in the age of Augustus or Tiberius rather than later, then we can give it a more meaningful role in the development of Platonism. Dillon (op. cit. p. 270) feels that the work 'in general maintains a level of stupefying banality'. Plutarch, though not a philosopher of the highest order, has a great deal more of interest to say on matters of interpretation. One would assume the same of Taurus, Albinus, Severus, and Numenius. But let us ask ourselves what was required in the generation or two following the extravagant distortions of Plato's epistemology which the age of Antiochus had produced.84 The well-being of philosophy demanded that a straight- forward account of the main Platonic texts should be given, avoiding wild attempts to force Plato into agreement with the views of the interpreter. K is such a work, steering a careful course between the sceptic and dogmatic views of Plato: 'I say, then, that in his r/77'IcELgS he inquires and does not declare himself, so that he sets nothing down as true or false; but to those familiar with his method he reveals his pleasure without our being aware of it' (59. 12-21). In A's view, Plato's opinions (and opinions he certainly had, for he also had s86ypara, 47. 48-48. 8, 54. 38-55. 13) emerged not through the words, but almost in spite of them. To this extent one is reminded of the attractive refrain of Eudorus of Alexandria: 'Plato is of many voices, not of many opinions'.85 Eudorus is the only serious candidate for consideration as the author of K, but we must defer consideration of his claims at present, since the authorship is of less importance than the place of A within the history of Platonism. We have seen, very broadly, his relationship to past discussion of Tht., but not yet with what followed. Here it must be noted that his piety,86 his deep interest in moral questions,s7 his dissatisfaction with Stoicism,88ss and his very mild New Academic sympathies all point 82 Charmadas, however, was prepared to use the distinction between knowledge and right opinion (Cic. De Or. 1. 92). 83 S.E. PH. 1. 235; see my interpretation, loc. cit. (n. 20, above) sections 5-6. 84 Perhaps Antiochus' excesses were in the realm of physics (Ac. 1. 24-9), but see S.E. Math. 7. 141-4. The orthodox view of Plato at Ac. 1. 46 was fairly extreme, though not compared with the view refuted by anon. Prol. (see nn. 66, 75). 85 Stob.

IN THEAETETUM 173 directly towards Plutarch: towards the figure who is the first undisputed Middle Platonist. It is not improbable that Plutarch actually followed K at the beginning of his first Platonic Question.s9 Where we do find a positive epistemology in Plutarch,90 it is based firmly on the Meno as is K's. Plutarch shares a strong, if not overriding, interest in the mathematical element in Plato's works with A and with others of his age (and also with Eudorus, see Mor. 1019 e-1020c). Assuming that A made his name in Alexandria (an attractive conjecture, bearing in mind the interest shown in Aenesidemus and the fact that little attention is paid to Antiochus9g), one would naturally look to Plutarch's tutor Ammonius92 as a figure likely to have introduced him to A's work. Ammonius himself shared A's interest in flux-doctrine," his faith in providence,94 an emphasis on search rather than discovery,95 and a lip-service to values of the Fourth Academy.96 There are also elements of the Meno's epistemology at Mor. 385c, where Ammonius is speaker.97 With Ammonius one naturally compares Philo of Alexandria, who shares with him the view that God alone truly 'is',98 and who likewise combines with his strong religious conviction a wavering distrust of mortal knowledge.99 Philo is usually seen as a dogmatist,100 but one must ask in what sense (if any) this description might be valid. Dillon makes use of Cong. 140-4, where Philo employs Stoic definitions of irEXV- and Lurvca'rgT"lq. He claims (p. 145) that the definition of knowledge as KaT&amp;a'AqiLS acoaAl K Kai flgflaos, 'tLE'r7TrWTOO r O A6 OyoU 'presupposes the whole Stoic theory of knowledge'. But it is well known that the New Academy adopted Stoic definitions without having any intention of adopting the system as a whole. Here Philo is merely 89 See n. 56 above. 90 Olymp. In Phd. 155. 24 ff. and 216. 1-26 (Norvin); see n. 55 above. 91 Glucker Ant. pp. 90-7 challenges the notion that Antiochus could have influenced Alexandria directly though some influence may have come about through his pupils Dio and Aristo. I add that I find no evidence of A ignoring Antiochus, or failing to mention him where it was relevant to do so. 92 See Glucker, Ant. pp. 124-34, on the relationship of Ammonius to Plutarch. 93 Mor. 392a-393 a, cf. J. Whittaker,' Ammonius on the Delphic E', CQ n.s. 19 (1969), 185-92. For K see 63. 48 ff. 94 Mor. 393ef, 413ef, 435e; cf. K 58. 39-59. 2. 95 See Mor. 385cd. For him r rp-rEZv is the source of philosophy (cf. Meno 86bc), while the source of search is T O'avka'ELV and r a7nopEiv (cf. Meno 84bc). Note too Ammonius' approval of the  Ur?ITELS~ that have sprung from the Delphic maxims (385d). K too sees qT5r(aELgs as the essence of Platonism, 58. 23, 59. 7, 13. 96 Mor. 746b shows the semi-sceptic B35 of Xenophanes to be a favourite quotation of Ammonius; the Delphic maxims which he praises invite and receive (387 f., cf. 431 a: T , ayav T7 7TLTEWS) an Academic interpretation. As for self-awareness, Ammonius relates it to awareness of our mortal nature, including our inability to apprehend and the non-apprehensibility of things of this world (392a-e), concluding oEVEraL 7) a'aOcrlats yvola "roi vTros EtvaLt r kaLVt/LEvov.

For Ammonius see Mor. 393 a ff. 99 Philo's flux-doctrine and this-world scepticism occur most obviously at Jos. 125-47. Human life is compared with a dream (126), then Philo dwells on man's changes from birth to old age (127-9), recalling Ammonius' remarks at Mor. 392de; cf. A's comments on the growth-process, cols. 69-70, probably on 152e 1. At 142 we read of rT Ov 7roZ KaraA'JEUaLv dflla ov, and at 147 the flux/non-apprehension doctrine is applied specifically to earthly things, as opposed to heavenly things where both stability and cognition are to be found. Similar links between flux and non-apprehension are found in the Aenesideman passage at Ebr. 170, 172-4, 178-80. 100 e.g. Dillon MP, p. 144 n. 1, where he assumes that Philo must, as a dogmatist, be using Aenesidemus for his own dogmatic purpose.</page><page sequence="14">174 H. TARRANT taking over from his source a body of theory which may be adapted for his own purposes without feeling that it conflicts with any of his basic convictions. The passage has signs of Antiochian influence,101 and since the same definition of 7~-XVq as at Cong. 141 occurs also in Antiochus' pupil Aristo of Alexandria, who had become a Peripatetic,102 it is possible that Philo draws on Aristo. This isolated passage thus provides no evidence for contemporary Platonism. To support his reading of Cong. 140-4 Dillon also asserts that the Stoic theory of sense-perception is given at Immut. 41-4 and QG 3.3, but in neither passage is there much that is incompatible with a mild sceptical attitude. Thus virtually the whole case for a committed dogmatist epistemology in Philo's extensive work rests on one passage. If we were to take a different, much longer passage on which to base our assessment, Ebr. 166-205, we might conclude that Philo was a faithful, if rather incompetent follower of Pyrrhonism; but again only a few passages of harmless sceptical tendency could be used to support such a view.103 A sensible estimation of Philo's work must rely chiefly on the recurrent factors, not on passages which are striking but unique. One such factor is the recognition of the alO'cd0'cELs and the &amp;LivoLa or voi3s as KptL(qpLa:104 unremarkable in itself, but a criterion of the kind which A seems to recognize (S&amp;' oi, col. 2); the criterion KaO' 0, i.e. the Stoic Ka-raATr-rLKtK fav'rauaa, is not part of Philo's regular epistemology,105 a fact which points towards Fourth rather than Fifth Academic influence.106 The Aenesideman passage (Ebr. 166-205) contains several exhortations to suspend judgement,107 and though Philo would not normally idealize Eo7rox~, it features again in a more limited application at Fug. 135-6, 193, and 206. Here Philo is chiefly concerned that we should Xrr'XrELV on matters which are 8hAa (206) or without 7TrTELS (136). It was the tendency to make pronouncements on unclear issues, which was the principal mark of dogmatism in the eyes of the sceptics,108 but even the Stoic agreed on the need to suspend judgement on occasions,109 so that Philo's warnings here are no indication of genuine scepticism - only of recognition that caution was often a virtue. Antiochus' revived 'Platonic' dogmatism placed much emphasis on the reliability 101 Note the infallibility (in his field) of one who is wise, temperate, or philosophical (142), which is inspired by the Stoic concept of the sage (cf. Cic. Ac. 2. 23-4, etc.). We have an Antiochian view of the relationship of mind to senses at 143: it uses them as servants, and through them perceives more than they do alone (cf. Cic. Ac. 2. 30; S.E. Math. 7. 144, 226; Ph. L.A. i. 29). At 144 we learn that just as mind is a sensation of the sensations (cf. Cic. Ac. 2. 30) so E7TLaT7/CL7k is a T7XV- qTEXVWV (cf. Antiochus' 'ars quae vera a falsis possit distinguere', Ac. 2. 57). 102 Aristo Alexandrinus, fr. 5 (Mariotti): 'ars...collectio est ex perceptionibus et exercitati- onibus ad aliquem vitae finem pertinens, etc.'. Mariotti compares Olymp. In Gor. 63. 11 = SVF i. 22. 3 ff. Aristo's defection is recorded by Index Acad. 35. 14; Strabo (17. 1. 5) calls him a Peripatetic. 103 e.g. Conf. 125-7, Fug. 188-93, Jos. 125-47. 104 e.g. Ebr. 169, Conf. 127, Her. 246. 105 The adjective KaraArTTnLK6Sg occurs only at Her. 32 in the course of a totally unremarkable division of presentations. In the same passage and later at 209 he uses the pair aKardTr770roS and KaraAq7rrr?"9; the latter term occurs only 13 times in other treatises, often with a negative, never in such a way as to suggest strong Stoic influence. 106 Philo of Larissa seems to have recognized criteria (Stob. Ecl. 2. 40. 19 Wachsmuth), probably intellect and senses; K 2. 23-32 may follow, as does Plut. Mor. 1024e. Antiochus insists on the retention of the Stoic criterion. 107 Ebr. 169, 192, 200, 205. 108 See S.E.

Thus any attack on the knowability of the sensible world would constitute a threat to dogmatist epistemology in the Antiochian tradition.110 Apart from the Aenesideman passage, part of the De Josepho (125-47) likens our apprehension of this world of flux to mere dreams. The tone of the passage may best be understood as stemming from a revived Heraclitism within 'Academic' circles."' One may trace other passages too with Heraclitan overtones (e.g. Conf. 104-6) or with criticism of sensation (e.g. Fug. 188-93). A further notable passage (Spec. 1. 333-43) condemns both those who attach excessive importance to the powers of the senses and those who overrate man's mind, as if to remind us rather that wisdom is God-given. Prov. fr. 1 conveys a similar message about the fallibility of even the most outstanding man. Philo's language does not resolve the difficulties which one experiences in trying to place him on the scale of dogmatism and scepticism. Frequently enough he speaks of the KaTdiArI/LS of certain things as possible,"12 but that would not conflict with Fourth Academic principles as long as it was not the Stoic definition of Ka7ah-A~LS which was employed (S.E. PH. 1. 235); on the other hand there are a number of cases of the language of mildly sceptical Platonism: (a) rr'v T V OV AOEUlv v EtVovA0arrvaL'av O6v adVyKi7 to'vov ELS'vaL, Tr1v S' ELKOTL rT'roxaU/Lt) -TLOav7v Ka' LEAoyov EvaL SoKoiaav obK noKplr7Trrov.

(Jos. 143) It is not so much that Philo tries to steer a middle course between scepticism and dogmatism: rather he sees mild scepticism as the proper product of philosophic enquiry, which will end in mere 'reasonable' and 'probable' conclusions. Men are bound to judge by such criteria (Opif. 45), unless, like Moses (Sac. 12-13), they are able to reject these New Academic criteria and replace them by a higher truth from God. These criteria are second best (Spec. 1. 38), the criterion of the' Egyptian sophists' (Migr. 76, Som. 1. 220) whom Philo no doubt saw as the archetype of non-Jewish Alexandrian intellectuals. But traditional philosophy offers nothing more; qua philosopher, Philo retains a mild Academic scepticism, but no more.113 His mildness is evident at Her. 246, where he tries to take advantage of the disagreements among philosophers. Those who make man the measure are contrasted with those who confound the criteria of the mind and the senses; those who think that everything is non-apprehensible are then contrasted with those who think a very great deal to be apprehensible. One may associate the former sceptical group, whose activity is seen to be more destructive, with the Pyrrhonists (cf. K 63. 1-40), who would not 110 Note Cic. Ac. 2. 19-20, 30, making much of the cognitive power of the senses. 1"1 It is clear that flux-doctrine is most naturally at home in Platonism. The language of images and dreams suits Platonism (ava5wypdEtLw, avEolSwAo7TroLtv, 126), as does the eternal wake- fulness of the heavenly world (147). The phrase EtIKOL aUTOoXaa/ KaS EbA6yOLSot 7LtOavO7VTUL (143) combines Platonic and Academic terminology. Pyrrhonism did not recognize the concept of 7TLOaVor'TS , nor the distinction between vivra and k 6ivra (126). At 142 we seem to meet the notion that KaTrAr/LST can fall short of certainty, as in Philo of Larissa and [Galen] 14. 685 (Kiihn). For a reply to H. von Arnim's theory that the Heraclitism of Jos. comes from Aenes. (Quellenstudien zu Philon von Alexandria (Berlin, 1888), 79 ff.) see Burkhard, op. cit. (above, n. 66), pp. 175-82. 112 A striking case occurs early in Somn. I, where Philo argues that the fourth items in various series of four components are aKaTdAr77rTov while the rest are KaTraA7rrrd. But note that KaTa~r/Lst need not imply certainty in Philo, n. 111 above. 113 Usually UKE7TTLKOL' are just 'inquirers' in Philo (see K. Janacek in Listy Filologicke 102 (1979), 65-8), and for this meaning see Her. 247, 279, Ebr. 98, 202. The last-mentioned case of the non-sceptic sense is notable, as it comes at the end of the Aenesideman passage (preceded by aKE'OELS dOV'O-rlrot).</page><page sequence="16">176 H. TARRANT have asserted that things are non-apprehensible; the latter group, who do assert this, would appear to be the more radical adherents of the New Academy. Philo avoids associating himself with any of the groups mentioned, and attacks both' Investigators' (i.e. sceptics: see R. Marcus in the Loeb) and 'Academics' at QG 3. 33. Philo's anti-Pyrrhonist stance requires one to explain how it is that he is willing to follow eight of Aenesidemus' tropes at Ebr. 166-205. One assumes that he would have found Aenesidemus' writings dry and pointless, and I doubt whether it would have occurred to him to adapt such material for his own positive purposes. There are two main alternatives: (a) Philo's thought had gone through an early sceptic phase, and (b) he has inherited the ideas of Ebr. from a mild Academic source.114 Let us consider the case for such a source. There is no question that Philo must have had access to the work of his fellow-Alexandrian Aenesidemus, nor that he had the ability to adapt his ideas for his own purposes."5 The question is whether he would have been more likely to be influenced by an Academic adaptation of the original. The character of the adaptation is consistent with mild Academic doctrine, leaning towards Plato. There is a constant and positive message behind the passage, to the effect that man's powers of cognition are weak (166 etc.) and that things are shrouded in obscurity (167 etc.). This would have sounded suspiciously like dogma to Aenesidemus,116 and he would have taken objection to such language as 7rTartELS vapyE^g KaraTrllqaS (175) or -rv ... '~EyXOV Evapycw S&amp;aQuvlarraLw (185). The sceptic had to oppose proof (tor~Lts),117 and reject any classification of irihpressions such as is implied by the concept of EvdpyELa (see K 61. 35). He does not affirm &amp;Ka7raAqrll a, which is a New Academic principle.11s Also New Academic is the term Janapi6AAraKroS, which occurs only in this essay (90, 169) of all extant Philonian works; at 90 it was applied to identical twins, a standard Academic example.119 A Pyrrhonist could hardly speak of' our joint criteria, sensation and intelligence, fashioned by nature...' (169), nor even of a 'cause' (180).120 Little in the way of Aenesideman language can be found,"' and the third trope is missing.122 The passage lacks the direct and methodical approach which other sources lead us to associate with Aenesidemus. A Heraclitism is present (170, 172-4, 178-80), but even 114 Against this see Burkhard, op. cit. (n. 66), pp. 182-94. "I See Burkhard, op. cit. (n. 66), p. 193. 116 Ijudge from Phot. Cod. 212, 170a2-3, 5-6, 9-11, where Aenes. seems to be criticizing the dogmatic terminology of Academic Heraclitism: 'at one time such, at another such, for one man such, for another such', etc. At 17-22 he complains openly about dogma in the Academy, attacking such distinctions as virtue/vice, good/bad, true/false, probable/improbable, real/not-real. 117 Perhaps a sceptic's attack was directed against d7T&amp;SEt~LTs and at/ELa rather than TL'UTELS generally, but D.L. 9. 78, following mention of Aenes., says that sceptics abolish 7rUTLS concerning 7rpa,'ytaTa. Moreover Philo's rrTL'IE imply Tr m7TLOavOv, which Aenes. rejects (Photius 170a7, 20), just as A's account of Pyrrho involves rejection of the 4vapy(/ldpuvup6's distinction (61. 35).

Janacek (Eirene 14 (1976) 99), one is forced to consider also r 'rrapdrrav (186), but this term is common in Philo. 122 Since no attempt has been made to preserve the numbering of' tropes' this is not surprising. Also missing is the ninth mode (tenth in D.L. 9. 87), but then there were only nine modes in</page><page sequence="17">THE DATE OF ANON. IN THEAETETUM 177 if theories of a Heraclitism in Aenesidemus are correct, the basic flux-doctrine which we find here is not that of Aenesideman Heraclitism as portrayed at S.E. PH. 1. 210-12: there opposite properties are attributed to objects as a result of conflicting impressions, here it is rapid change of properties which explains those conflicting impressions.123 Heraclitism here resembles that which we find elsewhere in Philo, and that in turn resembles what we find in Ammonius and Plutarch, in Seneca's Ep. 58 (on Plato), and in Maximus Tyrius.124 The common source (if any) could not be Pyrrhonist. The total picture is Academic rather than Pyrrhonist in general tone and in detail, and has the added attraction of being in harmony with a great deal of what Plato said in Tht. about flux and the relativity of sensations (152a ff.). The picture of education as a mystery leading to a brief vision of reality at 168 seems highly Platonic. 125 So is the comparison of our waking world with our dreams at 180 (cf. Tht. 158b-d). K is witness to a brand of Platonism which saw deep connections between the revived Pyrrhonism of Aenesidemus and the Heraclitan flux-doctrine and Plato in Tht. A virtually accepts the Pyrrhonist claims of relativity in respect of the sensible world as well as the flux-doctrine. Undoubtedly he would have known the tropes ofAenesidemus, and he may well have used them (as Favorinus, another Academic, did later). The passage of Philo is far more literary and imaginative than anything which we meet in K, but then it presumably draws on a work of a literary genre rather than a basic commentary. On present knowledge it is possible that Philo follows some work of A, not only at Ebr. 166-205 but also at Jos. 125-47 and in other passages where Academic attitudes prevail. A's kind of Platonism is also Philo's kind of Platonism. They share a readiness to discuss and make use of a number of Stoic ethical ideas as well as an interest in scepticism. Neither would be classed as sceptics today, for they both teach confidently and with positive purpose, and both seem to have a religious faith which surmounts doubts about the details of this world. They also share an interest in Tht., from which Philo draws the longest of his Platonic quotations at Fug. 63 and 82.126 Though these are taken from the moral digression (176ab/176c), Philo's interests extend to the 'midwifery' section (Her. 181, Mut. 144) and the wax-tablet episode (Her. 181, Mut. 212). One cannot assert that A influenced Philo; one can suggest that somebody like A did so. Philo uses mild scepticism to lift our minds away from our thirst for earthly knowledge towards the non-material. Even in a passage which attaches importance to the sense (Mig. 187-97), we learn the need to escape their influence if we are to obtain higher knowledge. The message is indeed familiar from Plato's Middle Dialogues: Phd., Symp., Rep., and Phdr. Allusions to these works, as to Tim., Tht., and Laws, are common in Philo.127 The theme of the flight of the soul to a higher plane Aenes.' Hypotyposis (Aristocles in Eus. P.E. 14. 760b), so that the tenth must have been a late development. 123 See Burkhard op. cit. (above, n. 66), pp. 180-2 on the non-Aenesideman nature of the Heraclitism here. 124 See J. Whittaker, 'Ammonius on the Delphic E' CQ n.s. 19 (1969), 185-92, on the connections. 125 cf. Theon Smyrnaeus, Expos. 14. 17-16. 2 (Hiller); Albinus Prol. 6 (150. 15 ff. H). Perhaps also Cic. Ac. 2. 60, Plut. Mor. 391 de (an odd reference to the mysteries in a Platonic context). 126 See the note of F. H. Colson in the Loeb. The length of the quotation and the naming of the source of the earlier passage is remarkable in an author who usually only alludes to his Platonic sources. 127 My own collection of Platonic allusions agrees with Dillon's findings (MP, p. 140), gathered from the Cohn-Wendland's index, as to the important dialogues for Philo. Tim. far outstrips others, and Crat. might also have been mentioned.</page><page sequence="18">178 H. TARRANT did not emerge in extant later writings until Philo (e.g. Opif. 70-1, Her. 68-70) and its origin has been the subject of contention.128 But Tht. 176a5-dl is the most striking passage in Plato concerning such a flight; it is this which Philo quotes at Fug. 63 and 82; it is this which identifies the flight with the process of assimilation to God - with which it is also connected by Philo (Opif. 69). Above all, it is this passage which, in a work on knowledge, clearly associates aoola and &amp;yvoLa with that higher plane, pouring scorn on all other SEtv6o 7r7E and aoklatL (176c 4-d 1), making it the supreme authority for those who wished to combine mild scepticism of mortal matters with a belief in a higher wisdom, based on assimilation to God. Details of Platonic interpretation before the time of Philo of Alexandria are few indeed, but we can say with some confidence that one could expect a commentary on Tht., with emphasis on the moral digression, to have emerged during this period. A's interpretation of 176a 5-d 1 is lost together with all but the early part of K, but one can see from 7. 14-20 that the concept of assimilation to God was fundamental to A's ethics. Thus he must have discussed the passage at length, and, being about to write on Phd. (48. 7-11), he must have realized the importance to Plato of rising beyond what the senses offer, up to a purer world in which the intellect may triumph. When he promised that his account would show how Plato and the Academics (with very few exceptions) shared the most important dogmata (54. 43-55. 7) what could he have had in mind? I suggest (a) the doctrine of the flux and non-apprehensibility of the sensible world, (b) some basic points about the mind, memory and senses,129 (c) the impossibility of building up any compound knowledge without knowable elements (cf. Tht. 201 d if.), and (d) the ideal of becoming as like a God as possible in wisdom and morality.130 These considerations suggest that K belongs shortly before Philo of Alexandria, just as previous evidence (pp. 167 ff.) placed him before Philo's contemporary Thrasyllus. Thus we are able to narrow our search to a period before A.D. 30, probably considerably before that date. Indeed another factor suggests that we ought to select a B.C. date for K. The Augustan age saw the introduction of a new criterion of knowledge, the most accurate impression of the eclectic Potamo (known to us from D.L. 1. 21 and the Suda). Col. 61 mentions various Hellenistic criteria and various distinctions between types of impression, asserting that Pyrrho would have rejected them all, regarding all impressions as of a uniform nature. This would have provided A with an excellent opportunity to mention the new criterion and the corresponding '"8 See R. M. Jones, 'Posidonius and the flight of the Mind', CP 21 (1926), 97-113. '29 For an odd collection of Academic placita on the senses, of a basically Fourth Academic character, see Diels, Dox. 396b5-7, 17-19, 398b24, 403b8-11. 130 It is difficult to make out a case for 6pLoltwas having been the New Academic telos, yet A seems to be committed to the defence of such a claim, since the telos is one of two supreme issues (Ac. 2. 29). Glucker has shown (Ant. pp. 55-60) that Cic. was aware of a telos espoused by Plato (Ac. 2. 129), for his position was said to be close to that of Erillus (the good = knowledge) and to have something in common with the Megarics (the good is one/same/eternal). Eudorus (Stob. Ecl. 2. 55. 15-17, on which see H. D6rrie, Platonica Minora p. 303) was aware that some saw wisdom+pleasure (allegedly the second good of Phil. 66b 1-3) as the telos of human life, suggesting that he was seen to propose some more divine telos even before Eudorus. Indeed both Posidonius (cf. F 187 Kidd) and Antiochus (in Clem. Strom. 2. 131. 2-133. 3, see R. Hoyer, De Antiocho Ascalonita, Diss. (Bonn, 1883), 26 ff.) seem aware that 6toltouL~ gE&amp; served as a kind of telos in Plato, though Antiochus recognized that the problem was extremely complex. Ac. 2. 129 demonstrates that Antiochus' Academic opponents also recognized the complexity of the issue, but saw that wisdom was crucial; Eudorus saw pp6vrl'ac as the key to 6tolw'oUs (Stob. Ecl. 2. 49. 10), placing emphasis on Tht. 176c4 and b2 (ETrd&amp; qpovauEwsg). Note in particular that the wisdom of Tht. 176c4 is not merely a system of factual knowledge, and thus not entirely incompatible with Academic hopes.</page><page sequence="19">THE DATE OF ANON. IN THEAETETUM 179 distinction between accurate and inaccurate impression, if (a) Potamo had already begun to use them and (b) A was aware that he had done so. So that, if A lived in close enough contact with Alexandria to hear of Potamo's work (as is highly probable), he was probably writing before Potamo tried to establish his criterion. Since this was some time in the Augustan age, a B.C. date for K seems likely. If the author of K is a figure otherwise known to us as a Platonist, Academic, or scholar interested in Plato, and if he does not follow Thrasyllus and Philo of Alexandria, then there is little remaining doubt about his identity. Dio of Alexandria and Thrasyllus just qualify for consideration;131 but if it is neither of them, then Eudorus of Alexandria alone remains. We may examine the claims of Dio and Thrasyllus first. With Dio we encounter problems of deciding whether the Dio we meet in one context is identical with the Dio of another context. Dio was not an uncommon name, but it is perhaps not too ambitious to connect all references to a Dio from the Academy (where chronologically possible) with the man who appears as a respected pupil of Antiochus of Ascalon at Cic. Ac. 2. 12 and Index Acad. Herc. col. 35. Plutarch (Mor. 612 e) records that a Dio from the Academy had thought the events of symposia worth recording, Stobaeus tells of an 'Academic' who made a memorable remark when returning from a symposium (Flor. 19. 17, p. 537 H), and Athenaeus has material from a Dio from the Academy which looks as if it may well derive from a symposium-style work (1. 34b). Strabo tells us that it was an 'Academic' Dio who died leading an embassy to Rome in 57 B.C. (17. 1. 11), and we may assume that the writer of symposia was the same Alexandrian who ended his life in this way. Thus, if he had written K, he would have done so at a date even earlier than I should have proposed for it. The composition of symposia would certainly belong in the Platonic tradition, though it would offer equal attraction to the dogmatist and to the semi-sceptic. A positive message could easily be conveyed, but outright affirmation that P and -Q could certainly be avoided. That Dio belonged to Antiochus' circle at the time of the Sosus-crisis, and that he was highly regarded by Antiochus, are not sufficient evidence to assume that Dio was such a committed dogmatist. Antiochus had written respected works as an Academic-sceptic (Ac. 2. 69), and we do not know whether his own group of followers was already formed before he took his last strides towards dogmatism. If it had been, then it is unlikely that all his followers would have embraced the Stoic criterion of knowledge without reservations. An adherent might well have stayed with Antiochus because of the attraction of his moral philosophy rather than because of confidence in Stoic epistemology. But even so, it is very difficult to believe that any Antiochian would have had the same sympathy for the Pyrrhonians that A shows in cols. 61 and 63, or that he could have subscribed to an epistemology which showed (apparently) no sign of Stoicism whatever. We are better able to say what type of philosophy Thrasyllus adhered to. It was the Pythagorean wing of Platonism which attracted him,'13 together with mathematics, music, astronomy and astrology.'33 Though A took the mathematics of Tht. seriously, and regards Pythagoras as a forerunner of Platonic doctrine in at least one respect,134 one would be wary of attributing to him such strong Pythagorean sympathies as to 131 One might also mention Theomnestus, see below, p. 182. 132 Thrasyllus wrote on the first Principles of Pythagoreanism and Plato (Porph. Vit. Plot. 20), and believed that Democritus had been a follower of Pythagoras (D.L. 9. 38). 133 He is a major source of Theon's Expositio on Platonic mathematics; his astronomy features twice in Achilles Intr. ad Aratum (43. 9, 46. 30 Maass); musical work is mentioned by Porphyry (Ptol. Harm. 266); he became Tiberius' astrologer. 134 Pythagoras is alleged to have introduced the problem of growth (70. 5-9).</page><page sequence="20">180 H. TARRANT Thrasyllus. Thrasyllus had also taken unusual interest in the arrangement of Plato's writings into tetralogies, in their classification, and in their subtitles,135 while A seems not to have discussed the place of Tht. in a tetralogy or in a particular class of dialogue, for the scant remains of col. 1 suggest that the introductory words were about the historical background of Tht. A is thus unlikely to have arranged the books of Democritus either, as Thrasyllus did (D.L. 9. 45), nor does one expect him to have written Prolegomena to the Books of Democritus (cf. D.L. 9. 41). Moreover, if Thrasyllus had written K, then we should have expected a reference to Potamo's criterion (see above, p. 178). And finally, if A had subtitled Tht., he would surely have called it On simple Knowledge, not just On Knowledge (see above, p. 167). With Eudorus we at last meet a figure who is known to have commented upon a work of Plato, and to have had his comments read by Plutarch (Mor. 1013b, 1019 e-20 c), thus influencing second-century Platonism. It seems that he was influential enough in the age of Arius Didymus to warrant extensive use of his work, and hence a substantial passage from his work on the divisions of philosophy is used in Stobaeus (Ecl. 2. 42. 7 if. Wachsmuth). For present purposes I shall follow the example of Zeller, D6rrie, Theiler, and Dillon in assuming that strong Eudoran influence continues not merely to 2. 45. 6 but well beyond, perhaps extending up to 2. 57. 12.136 Since Stobaeus' immediate source, apparently Arius, was surely identical to that from which he derived the preceding division from Philo of Larissa (2. 39. 20 ff. Wachsmuth), and since both are praised and described as Academics, one suspects that there is some connection between Philo and Eudorus in the mind of Stobaeus' source. Eudorus has regularly been connected with the dogmatic 'Platonism' of Antiochus of Ascalon, not with Philo or his associates,'37 but there is no evidence to point towards such a connection.

Dillon appears to mean Eudorus' problhmata, which had made up his work on the divisions of philosophy (Ecl. 2. 42. 9), interpreting 2. 45. 7-10 to mean that Arius (?) presents some of these, but in revised order. He regards the material up to 55. 21 as Eudoran (p. 125), and 55. 22 ff. as Arius' summary. Though the arguments hitherto used for Eudoran influence after 2. 45. 7 are less than compelling, I am in broad agreement with the conclusion. Ecl. 2. 45. 11-57. 12 gives a Platonic-Academic view of ethics to balance the later Stoic (2. 57. 13 ff.) and Peripatetic (2. 116. 19 ff.) accounts, but the material is handled differently in so far as the emphasis falls on the problimata themselves, not on a single set of doctrines; Plato's answers are given prominence, but interest is shown in related thinkers, as might be expected of an Academic. Interpretation of Plato is rather detailed to have originated with Arius, a Stoic, and Eudorus would be Arius' natural source for Academic material when he has just been consulting Eudorus' book of problemata. Even if I am mistaken here, it must be noticed that the previous view of Eudorus has owed much to the same assumption. 137 Glucker (Ant. p. 97, n. 268) rightly questions the usual view (e.g. Dorrie, Hermes 79 (1944), 26) = Platonica Minora p. 298) that Eudorus must have studied with Antiochus. Dillon (MP, p. 115) suggests indirect influence via Dio. Nothing in extant fragments had to be learnt from Antiochus' school; indeed Eudorus' basic study may have been with that of Posidonius, for (a) he is the source of Posidonian and Diodoran material in Achilles, (b) he may be the source of Posidonian interpretation of Tim. at Plut. Mor. 1023 bc, (c) his view of the Platonic goal, deeply indebted to Tim. 90a-d (see n. 177), may derive from Posidonius' similarly inspired view that one must follow the daemon within one, as it is akin to that which governs the universe (Galen, Plac. 5. 469 = F 187 Kidd), and (d) Posidonian emphasis on controlling the 7rTiOr may account for the prominence which Eudorus gives to the philosophy of impulse as one of the three parts</page><page sequence="21">THE DATE OF ANON. IN THEAETETUM 181 the contrary, Plutarch discusses the merits of certain interpretations of the Timaeus with him employing deliberate New Academic terminology (Mor. 1013b): 6 tp~v EiSwpos o'SE-TEpovs atLOLpEEv oLE-Ta, TOb ELKOT'o70S" otS' OKO,UtL  H A'TWvo9 atoo'TIEpOL 8,atLapXLpVELV 8 6 E, EL Kav6v, r nOavJ.

Eudorus has acknowledged that there is some truth in the interpretations of both Xenocrates and Crantor concerning Plato's psychogony. No doubt he wishes to use elements of both interpretations in devising his own. In his tempered praise of these Academics he has suggested that both to some extent achieve To ELKOS. Now Philo of Alexandria (Opif. 72, Jos. 143) provides evidence of the tendency during this period to associate 7- ELIKOS with the Carneadean criterion of TLom0av6v. We cannot be sure that Eudorus was applying it in this way, for the status of Timaeus' monologue as an ELKWSS ALOS was well known; but Plato himself had identified ' rrtOav6v with To ELK0~ at Phdr. 272e 1, and explained the latter concept in terms of likeness to the truth (Phdr. 273 d). Hence Cicero's veri simile, being closely linked with his probabile (Ac. 2. 32 etc.), is probably an attempt to render To EKoKs, and he too must have seen that concept as being virtually identical with the New Academic criterion of judgement; his translation of Tim. 29 cd confirms as much: 'contentique esse debebitis si probabilia dicentur', and 'si probabilia dicentur ne quid ultra requiratis'. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that in Eudorus' day any attempt to judge by T0 IK6~s would be seen as use of the New Academic standard. Had Eudorus been an Antiochian Academic, then it is unlikely that he would have wished to be seen employing such a criterion. The quarrel between Eudorus and Plutarch arose not over which criterion should be used, nor over its identification with New Academic probability, but over how it should be applied in this case. Plutarch claims that we should ask 'What is it likely that Plato was trying to say?', not 'What is likely to be the case?'.a38 We must apply our criterion to the interpretation of Plato, not to solving the problem in our own fashion. He implies that Eudorus had tried to show that the ideas of Xenocrates and Crantor were reasonable enough in their own right. Next Plutarch tries to twist another aspect of Fourth Academic epistemology against Eudorus: the principle of 0'poAoyla, associated with EvaipyELa by Philo of Larissa (Numenius fr. 28 des Places = 8 Lang) and by Cicero's Academic 'Cotta' (ND 3. 9-11). This 'criterion' is employed by Plutarch himself at Mor. 1062e, where it is related to the dichotomy between 'common' and 'private notions'; his suspicion of 'private notions' may also be seen at Mor. 999f-1000c (cf. K 48. 34). The point made against Eudorus is that it is Plato's 'agreement' which we should be seeking when interpreting him; in such a case it is not 'private' as opposed to 'generally agreed doctrines' that one avoids, but private as opposed to non-Platonic. The existence of a quarrel between Plutarch and Eudorus concerning the application of the principles of probability and of 'agreement' strongly suggests that they are of ethics (Ecl. 2. 42. 13-24 and particularly 2. 44. 3-6). Just as Aristo and Cratippus could later describe themselves as 'Peripatetics', so a Posidonian who developed (a) doubts and (b) love of Plato might come to describe his philosophy as 'Academic' once the school itself had ceased to exist. 138 As H. Cherniss (Loeb) points out, Plut. commits himself to proceeding on the basis of TO EIKgS at 1014a; TO EIK6S is again coupled with TO rrnOav6v at 728 f.; and we have an example of Plut. insisting on the application of rd E EIK to Plato's own opinion at 430b: 7TPs 7' v EKELVOU &amp;taivoLav ELdTyELv T' EIKS69. I find no clear example of the application of these criteria in the remains of Eudorus.</page><page sequence="22">182 H. TARRANT Academics of similar persuasions engaging in an esoteric dispute. One might try to deny the existence of such a technical quarrel, but in that case one must offer another explanation of the apparently contrived technical language (EIK6~, Kavcv, nTLavov, t8a o)'/.LaTa, 6pLoAoyoV;'Evov). While this is not conclusive evidence that Eudorus adhered to the semi-sceptical Platonism of Plutarch, it is an important piece of evidence in the absence of contrary indications. No less important is the fact that Eudorus is consistently referred to as an 'Academic' without any qualification.'39 We can be sure that the normal application of this term by the mid first century A.D. indicated only Academic sceptics,'14 as is the case in Philo of Alexandria (QG 3. 33). Then we may point to the case of Philostratus the Egyptian, who, in the age leading up to Augustus' triumph over Antony, i.e. the age of Arius and Eudorus, tried to claim the authority of the Academy for his sophistic practices: ~7 rpoTarP)cKvTrws, according to Plutarch (Ant. 80). Plutarch's words suggest that Philostratus' pursuits were not in keeping with the aims of the Academy rather than that he lacked the authority to use the title: indeed it is difficult to imagine how any such authority could be required after the breakdown of the philosophical schools. Why should a sophist claim to be an Academic? Presumably to give respectability to the practice of arguing on both sides of a question, a traditional ploy of the sophists too, particularly those who had special powers of rhetorical delivery. Theomnestus of Naucratis was another philosopher reported by Philostratus (VS 1. 6) to have been considered a sophist because of his rhetorical skill, but one cannot see why he should have seemed a sophist unless he had engaged in rhetorical displays of his arguments, aimed at impressing rather than at teaching. Arguments for both sides of the question would be a natural part of such a display, and it is reasonable to suppose that this Theomnestus should be identified with the Academic who taught Brutus in Athens in 44 B.C. (Plut. Brutus 24).'41 The fact that Brutus was willing to give ear to him certainly does not indicate that this Theomnestus was an Antiochian 'Old' Academic, and he may well have been only a temporary visitor to Athens.142 It is more likely that he is part of a new Academic-sophist movement, which can account for Philo of Alexandria's association of sophistry with scepticism,'43 and which culminated in the activities of the 'Academic' Favorinus of Arelate.'44 The fact that a sophist like Philostratus the Egyptian could call himself an Academic is a strong pointer towards that title's continued sceptic associations in the days of Cleopatra and Antony; Plutarch's questioning of his credentials is probably not original, but a signal that the correct application of the term had been a matter for debate among Philostratus' contemporaries. All the same we can say that Philostratus would not have found it attractive if its normal use at that time had been to indicate philosophers of Antiochian persuasion, who taught openly and with conviction. a39 Stob. Ecl. 2. 42. 7 (Wachsmuth), Simpl. In Categ. p. 187. 10 (Kalbfleisch), anon. I Intr. ad Aratum (p. 97 Maass). The adjective is used, not the phrase 'from [the] Academy'. 140 Philo QG 3. 33, Sen. Ep. 88. 44, Tac.

IN THEAETETUM 183 Plutarch and other later authors seem to avoid describing Antiochus or his brother Aristus as 'Academics' without qualification,'45 indeed only Dio is regularly known as an 'Academic' of those known to have studied under Antiochus. Whether or not Dio remained committed to Antiochianism, he did not, in spite of his prominence at Alexandria, cause Academicism to be identified with Antiochianism there. Even if he would have liked that to happen, the nature of 'Academic' philosophy had probably been determined rather by Aenesidemus' picture of it as a weak form of scepticism which failed to apply its principles fully, for Aenesidemus too taught at Alexandria.146 And since there is a fair chance that it was Alexandrian scholarship that produced the 'Aetius' doxography, one must note that the Academics who appear four times in the b-column seem to belong to the mild Fourth Academic mould.'14 Thus an 'Academic' in Alexandria during the second half of the first century B.C. must be expected to have some slight leaning towards mild scepticism, and this agrees with the remaining evidence for Eudorus. Even though he seems to have been influential in the formation of Middle Platonist doctrine, there is no evidence that he was dogmatically committed to any of it. He reports the beliefs of Pythagoras and Plato as he understands them,148 he records the cosmological views of Posidonius and Diodorus,149 he approves Old Academic (and probably Posidonian) interpretation of the Timaeus,15o and he attacks the organization of Aristotle's Categories.151 We see what he approves of and what he does not, but the same can be said of Cicero and Plutarch, who remained loyal to the New Academy. He uses definitions (Stoic ones),152 and produces his own division of philosophy;153 but these are respectable practices for an Academic, designed to clarify our notions (8tapOpoviv rd'&amp;s vvolag in the language of K and probably of Eudorus),154 and to provide a basis for rational discussion. 145 Plut. Luc. 28. 7:' Antiochus the philosopher', 42. 2-3: 'not the allegedly "new" Academy'; no title is afforded to Antiochus or Aristus at Brut. 2. 1-2, Cic. 4. 1. Strabo talks similarly of 'Antiochus the philosopher' (16. 2. 29), while Carneades is still the archetypal Academic (17. 3. 22). 146 Eus. Praep. Evang. 14. 763d (from Aristocles). 147 See above, n. 129. Note that in contrast to Plato and other early thinkers, who are together credited with the view that the senses are 'false' in the preceding lines, the Academics are said to accept that they can be healthy, but not that they have sufficient accuracy. The 'Academic' position is thus depicted as being more reasonable than Plato's (though well short of Antiochus'). 148 Plato in Stob. Ecl. 2. 49. 8 ff., 2. 53. 1 f., 2. 54. 10 if.

Mor. 1013b: no doubt he is approving of (a) Xenocrates' use of the principles of number, and (b) Crantor's having constructed the soul out of the materials which it is meant to cognize. Posidonius' interpretation at 1023bc appears to preserve the element of number, probably by using the Same and the Different as vehicles for the One and the Dyad (as in Plut. at 1024d, probably from Eudorus); it certainly postulated that the soul was composed of an intelligible stuff and a sensible stuff, in conformity with the requirement that it should apprehend intelligibles and sensibles, and we know from S.E. Math. 7. 93 that Posidonius adhered to the like-by-like theory of cognition when interpreting Tim. 151 Simpl.

TARRANT The tendency to regard Eudorus as part of an eclectic 'Platonist' movement that began with Antiochus is mistaken. The latter is influenced by Plato (+ Old Academy), Aristotle (+ Theophrastus), and the Stoa; he does not acknowledge the differences between these schools to be great, but sees himself as the follower of a single philosophical tradition.'55 He cannot, therefore, have seen himself as an eclectic. It is agreement between schools which allows him to dogmatize, just as disagreement entitles Philo of Larissa to doubt.156 Eudorus sees Plato as having a coherent body of doctrine, sometimes presented in a Pythagorean manner, sometimes not.'15 He sees a greater affinity between Plato and Pythagoras than we should today,'15 but this makes it less likely that he would have seen Aristotle and the Stoa as a continuation of the Platonic tradition. Aristotle seems to be an enemy (see n. 151). The cosmology, and probably the ethics, of Posidonius and Diodorus are respected, but not in such a way as to equate Platonism with Stoicism.'59 Thus Eudorus, unlike Antiochus, might well have admitted taking material from disparate philosophical sources. Indeed, such a policy ought to come from one who takes what is probable where he finds it, as Cicero thought the Carneadean school did (Ac. 2. 7-9). It should not come from one who trusts in a single body of doctrine which can be apprehended with certainty, for such doctrine must be found in a single teacher (the sage), making a plurality of sources unnecessary. Eudorus unquestionably had doctrine, and some of his interpretations of Plato and Pythagoras show sufficient bias for one to regard the doctrines attributed to them as his own beliefs - in particular the doctrine of a single metaphysical first-principle, over and above two opposite principles. This may take the (Platonic) form of a One over and above Ideas and Matter,160 or the (Pythagorean) form of a higher One over a One and Dyad (these latter being the formal and material principles).161 Nor is there doubt that some of Eudorus' own beliefs emerge in his division of moral philosophy. 162 But there is no doubt that A held many doctrines, as did Philo of Alexandria and Plutarch, upon whom we suspect A's influence: doctrine rather than dogma (in our sense). Philo and Plutarch have a very fluid doctrine, built in various ways around a few key principles. In Eudorus' terms, they (like Plato) are woA'owvos without being woA6~oeosg (Stob. Ecl. 2. 49. 25, 2. 55. 6). Since Eudorus admired this quality in Plato, we must assume that he tried to imitate it himself, revealing his beliefs somewhat 155 e.g. Cic. Ac. 1. 18, 43, 2. 15. 156 If Cic. follows Philo at Ac. 2. 116-34. 157 Stob. Ecl. 2. 49. 18-23: this shows various ways, including the Pythagorean one, in which Plato has presented his doctrine of the telos. At 2. 50. 2-4 (Wachsmuth) the unity of the doctrine is stressed. 158 This may be typical of his age, for so do Posidonius (T95 Kidd on the tripartite soul; perhaps he too saw much of Tim. as Pythagorean, for see S.E. Math. 7. 93-4) and, one suspects, Thrasyllus. See also K 70. 5-9 and Achilles, Intr. ad Aratum 37. 29-38. 2 (Maass), both of which may be the work of Eudorus. Moderatus and Numenius continue the trend. Known examples in Eudorus are Stob. Ecl. 2. 49. 8, 18-21 (Wachsmuth) and Simpl. In Phys. 181. 10 ff. (Diels). The trend stems from a search for increasingly ancient authorities. 159 For cosmology see n. 149; to expect to find distinctive Posidonian ethics in Eudorus would be highly optimistic, though he certainly follows Posidonius in regarding the distinction between rational and non-rational parts of the soul as fundamental. 160 Seen in his' Correction' to the text of Arist. Meta. 988 a 7, recorded by Alex. Aphr. In Meta. 59. 1 f. 161 Simpl. In Phys. 181. 10 ff.

IN THEAETETUM 185 indirectly. In such circumstances it is unprofitable to attempt direct comparison between Eudorus' doctrines and those of others, since he gave no statement of doctrine. We must rather compare interests. Eudorus appears nine times in Simplicius' Commentary on the Categories.x63 He is numbered, along with his rival Aristo, Boethus, and Andronicus, among the wraAatoi f'rlyr7Lal. The title 7yrlrY'7 may not describe him accurately, as the fragments suggest that he approached the Categories as an Academic critic rather than as a devoted commentator. One also wonders whether he tackled the whole work, as surviving criticism concerns material from 6 a 36 ff. to 10 a I 1 ff. only, and his interests are clearly centred on the concepts wrp6s TL, IrOLOV, and rroaov. In K the first of these appears at 20. 30-7, 40. 8-11, 63. 1-40, 68. 1-7, and 68. 19-36. In the first two cases, where 70 rrp6S t is contrasted with Tb r' oartv and r' KaO' a7,r6 respectively, nothing in the text of Tht. calls for the introduction of these distinctions, and so their appearance must be credited to the author's interest. From the later passages it appears that A accepts the view that all things are rp6s rt as far as the physical world is concerned. Hence, if A is Eudorus, then we can explain the thrust of the first extant Eudoran criticism at In Categ. 174. 14 (Kalbfleisch): Aristotle, he claims, distinguished between ,aO' aK~6 and wrp6s 7t but fails to consider the former. As Eudorus had been mentioned as one commentator who failed to understand Aristotle's use of the term 7rps 7TL (159. 31-3 K), one might naturally assume that he had understood Aristotle according to his own later interpretation of wrp6s r, by which all aspects of the physical world would be regarded as relative. Aristotle is accused of failing to discuss anything which he, Eudorus, could consider KaO' abr6, a Platonist's jibe at Aristotle's rejection of Platonic Ideas.'64 If such a criticism seems futile when considered as a direct criticism of Aristotle, one must remember that Eudorus' immediate target was probably Aristo of Alexandria, who also seems to have used the term in a very broad sense when interpreting the Categories.165 One Eudoran criticism is directed against the order in which substance, quantity, and quality are tackled, and it is argued that the logical order would be substance- quality-quantity.166 This agrees with Ps.-Archytas.167 After these three Eudorus appears to have placed time/place, though we cannot assume that he took great interest in questions of orderfor their own sake; the criticism of the order quantity-quality is a criticism of Aristotle's methodology, like other Eudoran criticisms.168 If Eudorus was convinced of an inviolable order, then he is not A, for A mentions substance, quantity and quality in their Aristotelian order at 68. 1-15: otherwise this column seems to support Eudoran authorship. It comments upon Tht. 152d2-4: vv Ihv acdr KaO' aV 7TO OME'V Ea7T, O Wv L 7T0TWOUETOLW pO3OCS OVS OIOLOVOVV 7L... The rt is held to show substance, the Iv quantity, and the 'rotovoiVv Jt quality. The acir' KO' abr6 is interpreted as meaning that substance, quantity, and quality are all rp60s TL, never Kaa' a76, in this world of flux. While A mentions quantity before quality, it should be said (a) that Plato consistently does the same throughout 152d, and (b) that 163 See above, n. 151. 164 A similar tendency is found in Nicostratus, Simpl. In Categ. 73. 15 ff. (Kalbfleisch). 165 He is quite capable of arguing that the universe is rrp6s rt at Simpl. In Categ. 188. 31 ff. (Kalbfleisch). 166 ibid. 206. 10 ff. 167 ibid. I cannot here discuss the relationship of Ps.-Archytas to Eudorus, but tend to believe that 'Archytas' follows later. 168 Perhaps their general futility is a reaction against the solemnity with which Categ. was treated by Peripatetics.</page><page sequence="26">186 H. TARRANT there is no pretence of a methodical approach. A shares with Eudorus an interest in the group of three principal categories, an interest in reducing their status to the level of 'relative', and (perhaps) an interest in denying to Aristotle the credit for their introduction. A's comments here are much as one would expect from a Platonist with Eudorus' interest in the Categories. Other interests shared by A and Eudorus are easily found: E;vctLaL,'69 OLKEtoWag,170 Epw9s,17' all of which are given rather more attention by both authors than one might have expected. A also shows the tendency, well known in Eudorus but present in Posidonius also,72 to trace Platonic doctrine back to Pythagoras.'73 Such inconclusive points of contact do assist one to create a picture of similarity of interests. Likewise, though it is not remarkable that both see 6p1olowas OEw as the Platonic 7hEAo,174 it appears that both write early enough to want to demonstrate the concept's importance in Plato.175 Neither shows the later inclination to relate the concept to a secondary God.176 Eudorus, while detecting the doctrine at Rep. 613ab and seeing Tim. 90a-d as a passage of enormous importance,'77 still regards Tht. 176a-c as crucial.178 This passage gives the allegedly Pythagorean concept additional 8tippwaWLs,1'79 which is what vutraKc EVvoLaL need in K (46. 44); later, in Plutarch and Albinus, emphasis is placed rather upon the need to awaken them.'80 Although we have clear indications of the importance of AoyLt9a6s in Eudorus,'18 we know nothing of his epistemology proper. Likewise we know nothing of A's physics. Comparison is only possible on their approach to ethics and to the categories. Even in ethics too little is known to present much overlapping or conflicting material. Both seem to see a gulf between perfected virtue seen as a near-unity'82 and the non-rational contributions to a better life.8s3 Both claim that the ancients recognized ethical concepts that only later became prominent.'84 It would not require great powers of imagination to reconcile all that is known of Eudorus with all that is known of A. 169 Eudorus in Ecl. 2. 48. 1, 2. 43. 19; K 4. 31-5. 3, 9. 30-11. 40. 170 Eudorus in Ecl. 2. 47. 12 ff., etc.; K 5. 14-8. 6. 171 Eudorus in Ecl. 2. 43. 19-44. 1; K 8. 23-7. Note that Dio of Alexandria (Plut. Mor. 612e) also shares the interest of both these passages in symposia. 172 For Eudorus see n. 158; for Posidonius see T 91, T 95 (Kidd). 173 See K 70. 5-9. 174 K 7. 14 and Stob. Ecl. 2. 49. 8 ff. 175 K has SE(iop/EV (preceded by a brief lacuna), cf. Ecl. 2. 50. 6 ff. 176 As Didasc. 28 (181. 36H); hence at 2 (153. 4-7 H) we meet 6'potlwa q rpTs 7"% OEcov, a better description of the process described at Tim. 90a-d, cf. Albinus Prol. 5 (150. 8-12H). Note that Eudorus' comments on Pythagoras' directive 'follow God' do make it clear what kind of God he envisages man following: the intelligible principle of cosmic harmony (Stob. Ecl. 2. 49. 16-18 Wachsmuth), not an anthropomorphic one. Hence he has the same God in mind as Albinus and [Alcinous], but as yet there is no need to distinguish this God from a higher one. Presumably the mistake against which [Alcinous] reacts had not yet been made. 177 See Stob. Ecl. 2. 47. 6, 49. 19-21, 50. 7, 53. 1-4; Tim. also determines what kind of God we must follow, 49. 16-18. 178 Of Eudorus' source-passages this alone has the phrase which he sees as Plato's clarification of the concept: KaT- 7o ~uvaT-rv (Stob. Ecl. 2. 49. 10 Wachsmuth). 179 See above, nn. 154, 178. is0 Mor. 1000e; Prol. 6 (150. 21 H); cf. Didasc. 5 (158. 3 H). 181 Stob. Ecl. 2. 53. 7-17 (Wachsmuth), cf. 2. 42. 20. 182 K 9. 37-10. 3; Eudorus can talk of the virtues separately, Ecl. 2. 43. 12, but elsewhere tends to think of it as a single entity (e.g. Ecl. 2. 50. 4-6, 51. 1-2 Wachsmuth). ls3 K 9. 37-10. 3 allows the Euviatl to oppose one another, unlike the perfected virtues. Eudorus introduces his conception of the 7TroTcEAlS, which compensates for the remoteness of his 7~hAos (Stob. Ecl. 2. 47. 12 ff. Wachsmuth). 184 Eudorus on the v7roTcEAlS (Stob. Ecl. 2. 48. 3-5 Wachsmuth), and K 7. 20-5 on olKElWLqt in Socrates and the Sophists. Note that Eudorus associates oIKEEWotLt with the ~7rorEAlS at 2. 47. 12-18, so that their claims are almost identical.</page><page sequence="27">THE DATE OF ANON. IN THEAETETUM 187 Eudorus thus remains the principal contender for the credit of having written K. If positive evidence is thin, it must be noted that differences between A and most Middle Platonists were easily detected. Absence of conflicting approaches, attitudes, and doctrines is thus an important indication that Eudorus of Alexandria wrote K. He is the sole Academic-Platonist commentator known to have flourished during the probable period of K's composition.l85 University of Sydney H.
