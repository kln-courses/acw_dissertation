<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOHN CHIOLES War Friends Pyrrho couldn't recall the year he ran away. Only that it was all brought about by the dream that seemed to last for nights on end. But he was sure when he did make a clear break hardly anyone noticed. He stopped to catch his breath as he came to the steep rise at the edge of town. He leaned for a moment, half-sitting, against one of those road markers Arkadia sported on its high roads before the war, a slab of marble they used to call Herm?s* phallus. Then, he took a sweeping look at the horizon: at Michael and Gabriel's belfry on one side and at the hill of the Ascension on the other. He'd already waved goodbye to the village square, crowned with his family's burned-down house, without any special feeling or regret, having decided to defer all that. At the side of the mountain, to Pyrrho's left, a shepherd leaned peacefully on his crook, not chancing a climb further up for fear the communist cadres, very likely old friends of his still lurking deep in the forest, might give him away by calling attention to his sympathies. Up ahead, at each kilometer, more road markers, fragments of celebra tions to the lesser Panos, echoes of Hermes the innocent messenger from earlier times, or so our Ancient Religion teacher liked to say. Pyrrho had no idea where he was going. Since the night of the dream that made him take to the road a euphoria had taken hold inside him. He could not read his own thoughts, no less his actions. His brain and body ran ahead of what he felt or thought. Any reflection of his whereabouts seemed redundant since he was already there. The train to Kalamata came and went through the Tripolis station. Pyrrho did not board it, though he did pretend to be waiting for it, scuffing his boots against the rail to shake the dried mud off them. Just then, two figures appeared at the other end; everyone had vanished from the platform, there remained only the heart-stopping rhythm of silence when trains become passing dreams. The two stood immobile for a time, boy and girl, barely grownups in the manner of the times. Pyrrho froze in place, unbreathing. Their power was such that they forced him to break the spell first; the youth moved his head and breathed in the direction of the train's silence. Then he took the girl's hand in his, protectively, and they began to walk towards Pyrrho as if he were pulling them on a rope, slow as a weakened magnet, without anticipation, though with the curiosity of anything goes. The distance became history and took forever?a saying that had the feel of the 90 Harvard Review</page><page sequence="2">ancient sentence, the time when everybody laughed at him in his Gymnasium class, just before he ran away. He was mulling over his decision to go when he tripped on the translation. There had been many mistranslations during his schooldays. This one he liked best, and it came popping into his head just now: The distance became history and took forever?he almost blurted it out loud. Pyrrho had no idea what the correct version was, the teacher never told him, but he thought he would faint while waiting for the distance to stop time. Then he could meet these torn pieces of his skin, these two vagrants from the dream, unmistakable magi, so they might together become the inseparable three. He had yet some space between them before they reached him. He was no more scared here than in the dream, as if this were not happening to him but to someone else nearby, though he knew he would be paying the consequences. He might even be transformed into that infernal giant bird, or into the river below him, in some pure anthropomorphic slush. More than birds usually are, this one was uncommonly real, and he was of an indeterminate age. Perhaps it was an eagle or a falcon, though its beak was friendlier, its eyes less fierce, yet piercing and wise at the same time. Only the color was strange. Ashen, against a gray background that looked as if it might crumble. Watching it, the picture seemed at once comforting and familiar, yet it made him feel anxious and poised on the wing of motion as when we are about to take a trip and wonder if we've packed everything. The dream was not the sort you tell to your grandmother so she can give you a reading of it. First of all, Pyrrho didn't know how much of a dream it was and how much it belonged to the disorder they kept telling him that he had developed of late. And then it lasted for several days. Daytime days, he thought, not just nights. Towards the end the days were an annoyance; he rather looked forward to the nights with uncanny excitement as if his very breathing would melt the snow ahead of him, with that whooshing sound, while he rushed headlong into the dream. He walked around inside the picture, always the whooshing sound following his steps, erasing them. Ashes fell away as soon as he stepped on them. He reached the bird and began to pet its head. It pricked up its neck feathers, showing trust and comfort, emitting a soft wooing from its throat, while Pyrrho was mesmerized and shameless. An erotic feeling came over him, and he never wanted it to end. Until avoice, speaking through his own throat, though hardly his voice, said that together with Pyrrho in its giant claws, they would travel far and wide. "A single whistle signifies Pella, the start of our journey. Two JohnChioles 91</page><page sequence="3">whistles, the Khyber pass in Cashmere. Three, we fly to Alexandria. Then we'll have a different sign for the more vulgar cities: Rome and Paris, London and New York. If you say vogel however, well end up in Berlin; we should be careful there." Pyrrho had no idea how he came up with such sayings. If these were a catalogue of Alexander's conquests, he and the falcon had certainly missed a few. Guided by the bird, his voice rose as if out of the old myths, at least it seemed like it at the time. Other than its being in a dream he had no reason to think of it as unreal. There were certainly worse stories to be heard and lived through every day in these desperate times. The bird hushed Pyrrho's sounds of anxiety and made him turn to watch what it was seeing. In the distance, along an endless road, bodies of soldiers laying alongside burned out vehicles; in the meadow, near the road, piles of corpses, emaciated and dismembered, gave the terrain its only hillocks. The steep mountain to the other side was made of human skulls as far as the eye could see. Yet nothing seemed disturbing. The grey ash and white snow, the sparse shadows, carried no sorrow or lament. A moment passed and the smoke-filled sounds of some distant city engulfed them. A train platform began to move in their direction. It resembled the present platform in Tripolis, though it was much bigger, endless really, with soot hanging in the air, the platform of a great industrial city. In the far distance, two figures began to come toward them; the space, so endless, was filled with terror: he was sure they would never ever reach them. Even though the platform was in full motion, they kept walking. "They're coming," Pyrrho said in his new voice. "They killed their father to avenge their mother. He had bludgeoned their mother to death in their bedroom in the throes of violent lovemaking. That lurid story the newspapers carried for months. Now they come: the water flows yet the river remains; the sun is new each morning, yet it never transgresses its course. Those deformed by fire are the succeeding transitions between opposites you can touch; these ashes the earth is made of are transformed fire, the fire transformed earth, as the dead are only the living become material earth and ashes. The living are burning dirt reawakened to life. And so it is too with the eternal identity that unites everything underneath, the tautorx where the unseen harmony opens our horizons only through this and that, me bird and you boy, our warring natures, the great contradiction and that unending exchange back and forth, the exchange of fire for all things, and the conflagration of py ros tropas-that's what it's all about. " Pyrrho thought to mock the bird's solemnity, and he did giggle for a second 92 Harvard Review</page><page sequence="4">unobserved, then thought better of it. Its easy for you to say, whispered the boy to the falcon. It seemed as if it was reading from a book. It crossed Pyrrho's mind, something he'd heard along time ago, the refugees of Ionia carried with them the memory, spoke of a great bird that flew standing still, wide eyed, high above all fires and was heard to sound out words from ancient books. They said that wherever you go you cany with you the same sky. "They killed their father, they killed their father/ came the sound as they were forever approaching. And the bird urged him to read on, to unravel the arc of truth, to face reality head on, assuring him that no myth would intrude on what was real, that the sun was as young as he, as those who were coming after him; and the world was moving on its course in perfect measure and strife, injustice and peace. "The boy with his sister are from Volos. They escaped from a train that was attacked by a guerrilla band on the road to Kalamata. They walked across the mountains for a long time. Pyrrho found them run down and practically delirious near a cave, just inside the forest. He took them bread and olive oil daily, plenty of fruits he picked on the road, cheese and olives, so they could gain back their strength. It was difficult to take in their stoiy from the contradictions each of them would utter. "The two are looking for their younger brother who had killed their father last winter when he'd turned thirteen. Their father, who was a renowned state's attorney, had been abusing their mother regularly, until one time he beat her so badly while they were in bed, that she died. That was two years ago. The court case against him, as you'd expect, was a travesty of lies, stupid witnesses concocting stories of their mother whom they never knew. The Father had everything fixed. He got off on time served and an apology from the State, since he was found innocent of all charges but one: he did not report the death immediately. He had locked the door to the bedroom for two days and refused entry to the children or the maid on the pretext that their mother was ill and could not be disturbed. But the children and the maid had heard the beating and the screams during the night. And they knew it was not one of the normal beatings. Yet none would speak up in court. "Then the children, all five of them, had a secret family meeting in the attic, one of them keeping constant watch on the road, lest their father return unexpected. And there they decided to bring justice on their father's head. They actually conducted a mock trial, as he had taught them to do, where they convicted him and sentenced him to John Chioles 93</page><page sequence="5">death. The big dilemma: who would carry out the sentence? It had to be done with his own revolver. They took out of his desk each day and set it on the kitchen table after he left, staring at it, taking turns to hold it in their hands. After the anguish each of them felt in the face of the big question, they decided the best thing was to draw lots. In the first round the lot fell to the eight-year-old boy, but he could hardly hold the revolver straight, let alone shoot it; and though he wanted badly to try, the older ones dissuaded him. The second draw fell to the fourteen year-old girl?the one forever coming on the train platform?who, each time she took the revolver into her hands, would weep uncontrollably and call out, 'Mama, mama.' Finally, the second oldest boy drew the longest matchstick on the third try. The thirteen-year-old took matters into his own hands: with grownup feelings of committing a just and necessary act as his lot in life, he executed the father with a bullet to the head while he slept. Then the boy threw the revolver down and ran away never to be seen or heard from again, lost easily in the crowds of civil strife. "There was a simple truth never spoken among the children: not all, it seems, are by the same father; the one coming now in our direction is by a handsome gypsy Magyar who wondered through Volos, one of the girls..." The bird's rhythm begins to slow down. Its attention trails off as if it is losing the thread that holds its picture together. Momentarily, a freight train passes through on another track. Desperate screams are heard while it rumbles by, all of it drowned out by the dust it raises. The bird pretends not to hear and looks away, releasing its hold on Pyrrho, causing him indeterminate pain and fear. Now the dream is pleasure no more, but anxiety and loss. Unable to look at the bird any longer, Pyrrho skips across the moving platform so he might overcome the deadly wait, and there resurfaces amid the ashes as in a palimpsest. The approaching couple is in perpetual stillness, though in some mathematical world their motion is inevitable. The dream has left him. Playing and skipping through the pictures of his world Pyrrho recognizes the things that scream at him each time he tries to imitate them. They must be played and pictured and moved on a stage, dreamed and celebrated, all with his very own body wrenched at the center; the mind can trail behind, when it wishes, to soothe and mend the delirium. He has no particular direction that he's headed toward, as he stands at the train station in Tripolis after the last train has pulled out. That boy and his sister, the only ones left on the platform, seem to have been saying something to him, but he hasn't heard them. They all stand for a time looking at one another, then look past over the 94 Harvard Review</page><page sequence="6">other's shoulder, embarrassed at not having heard what the other said. The Magyar is dark and lithe in body and spirit, his large green eyes burning and full of danger. She has a light brown, chestnut counte nance, exuding a power so immediate it can never be negotiable or partake of any logic. Pyrrho is not faced with a bodily hunger alone, but with a deprivation that makes the spirit reach back and rest comfort ably at the primordial roots. There, violence and picture-making, ritual uprooting and playing with fire, reside side by side. "My sister is hungry." "Here," Pyrrho reaches in his satchel and hands him the small loaf of bread. He answers with his eyes, momentarily moist in disbelief, yet remaining hard as before. "Take," Pyrrho says. Swiftly the Magyar produces a penknife tied to his belt, and with expert movements he slices off an end piece. Then without looking Pyrrho in the eye and with a touch of pride he hands back the loaf. Pyrrho stands suspended, loaf in hand, while the Magyar breaks off tiny pieces and feeds them to his sister, taking none for himself. The girl munches and swallows, tears running down her face. A moment later she begins to laugh, which makes all three of them laugh together, though they have no idea why. Now they are friends. And it is obvious to the three of them they will never leave one another. JohnChioles 95</page></plain_text>
