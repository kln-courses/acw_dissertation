Positivism is a very widely accepted attitude among scientists. It means abstention from all metaphysics. Man thinks metaphysically as naturally as he breathes; consequently the positivistic attitude is difficult to maintain. Some 'positivists' erect a metaphysics of their own which finds reality in laws of nature; they regard the laws of nature as ontological realities. No doubt nature has a certain order, but we cannot regard the laws of nature as things in themselves. For example, the mathematical form of physical laws is founded on a mathematics which is the product of an historical develop- ment. Could there be laws without mathematics, i. e., purely qualitative laws? Even if this were possible it would not improve the ontological status of laws of nature. The sulphur, e. g., of the chemist, is never found pure, and is really an ideal substance. Other such ideal existences are the 'ideal gas,' the crystals as they are shown by crystalographic models, the mathematical lever. All this is thought, generalization, abstraction. As St. Thomas says, existential est singularium, scientia est de universalibus. A law is an ideal construction, which does not express what happens, but what would happen under certain ideal conditions. And one should remark that the law dis- appears not only by being absorbed in a higher law, but also by being sup- planted by a more accurate and precise expression. This tendency to take laws as real is not, however, true positivism. The latter, anti-metaphysical by nature, regards laws as rules governing our relations with the outer world, the collection of our sensations. To analyze this theory one must discover 'the immediate facts of consciousness,' a~s Bergson attempts to do. Can there be a science of sensations as such? Malebranche held that such a science was impossible and that science always involves a concept of a thing. 443</page><page sequence="2">444 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. Physics assumes a real objective world throughout and deals with this rather than with our sensations. Whatever is regarded as belonging to the subject is thought an error, an anthropomorphism. The scientist is so firmly of the belief that he is dealing with objective reality that he creates new things in the image of those he is familiar with. Scientists dealing with electricity believe very firmly in the objective reality of the electric current, and would laugh at any other idea. If science were really positivistic and phenomenal- istic it would not invent new things. Geometry is founded upon substan- tialistic conceptions; without solids which moved without modification it would be impossible, says Poincare. Science implies the persistence of bodies through time and space with constant qualities. It is, then, not conformable to the positivistic schema, it needs the thing, it seeks being, it is ontological. Simultaneously with the development of science there have arisen philo- sophical systems. There have been four great types of philosophical theory of reality that have attempted to solve the ontological problem which is always implicit in science. They are, mechanism or atomism, the energeticist theory, philosophical realism, and mathematical idealism. Many who claim to be positivists are really materialists. Mechanism offers many difficulties. Movement is easily represented; but what is it that moves? There are two suppositions, the corpuscular hypothesis, and the dynamic hypothesis. But how does the corpuscle act? How does it manifest the absolute elasticity implied by the theory? How do the parts of the atom adhere to each other? According to the dynamic theory each atom is a point surrounded by forces; but how could this nothing exert inertia? Neither of these theories can show how one atom can act on another; and that is the basis of mechanism. At present the electronic theory of matter is widely held. This theory reduces everything to electricity, of ,which nothing is known; it thus reduces every- thing to an unknown X. Atomism is not really a scientific theory, but is of philosophical origin. It is really an a priori construction. In the last century it has had biologists, not physicists, as protagonists. The biologist is not intimately acquainted with mechanism, but uses it as a general principle to guide him in his research which consists in finding a mechanical explanation for as much as possible. Energeticism has a scientific origin, its author being Ostwald. Energy is for him a genuinely ontological principle. Philosoph- ically it is on the same level as mechanism, which seeks to reduce everything to the displacements of something constant; here, of energy. Energeticism has been of little use scientifically. It is a doctrine of continuity in nature, whereas atomism is a doctrine of discontinuity; the latter view is now given support by the discovery of the absolute magnitude of the atoms. Ener- geticism belongs to the past. Philosophical, or transcendental realism, has been defended by Hartmann. According to Hartmann science sets out from common sense, but reduces the world to something different. Through all its work of destroying directly perceived reality, it preserves time and space, and so arrives at what Hartmann calls transcendental realism. These views are similar to those held by many scientists. Why is it that</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 445 scientists always tend to believe in the identity of the atoms? To answer this question we must turn to Descartes. He reduced matter to purely spatial terms. This tendency is widely spread at present. Everyone recognizes the tendency to reduce all to ether, which is nothing but hypostasized space. Everything is reduced to the atom, the atom dissolved in an indistinct whole of time and space, like the sphere of Parmenides. Such tendencies are forcing science towards mathematical idealism, 'panmathematicism.' This doctrine has been worked out by Cohen and the Marburg school, who find the essence of things in the truths of mathematical physics. It reduces everything to a purely ideal world of mathematical concepts. Mathematics possesses uni- versal necessity, and not mere probability. But in physics there is always a factual element present as well as the mathematical. There is always implied a donnge, an ultimate quality, which seems to offer an obstacle to our rationalization of reality. The absolute magnitudes of the molecules con- stitute such donnees. Such irrationals may be expected. Might it not be that each division of science is founded on such an irrational? Such irrationals may divide physics and chemistry and biology from each other and may ultimately prevent the reduction of life to mechanism. Human free-will seems to be such an absolute beginning. The mathematician and philosopher may lose sight of these considerations and attempt to reduce everything to terms of mathematics. Such is the panmathematicism of the Marburg school. Panmathematicism is not positivism, but is a more adequate expres- sion of the spirit of science. This tendency of science towards mathematical idealism is universal and appears where least expected, in spite of its illogical character. Science seems to be involved in a contradiction. It is held between two tendencies, it tends toward the abolition of reality, and it tends in the opposite dierction because of the diverse donnees. W. CURTIS SWABEY. Energie et Force. F. LE DANTEC. Rev. Ph., No. 493, pp. 2-36. Man, knowing the world around him through the medium of his sense- organs, is led to construct objects and bodies, and to regard these as existing and as entities. But physics, using instruments which infinitely extend our powers of observation, interprets the grosser movements studied by mechanics in terms of the movements of atoms or of the yet smaller electrons. The phenomena of electrical induction reveal unsuspected relations in the world, which break down our notion of separate bodies and independent phenomena. Wherever we have a number of bodies before our eyes we may be sure that any modification of one affects all the others. At any moment within the limited circle which forms my universe, there are solids, liquids, gases and living bodies, all changing constantly in distinct ways. In any given store of energy there will be as many kinds as there are kinds of work or of change. It would seem as if this store of energy would be ultimately exhausted. The resources of the earth are, however, a whole,'and not thus actually separated, and, further, they are replenished by the sun. But the earth manifests phe-</page><page sequence="4">446 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. nomena unlike those produced by solar energy, indicating that with the dissipation of energy a totally different kind of energy is often formed. This conception of the transformation of energy would appear to make the earth independent of the sun, supposing the former to be once furnished with an definite store of energy. The sun is necessary, however, to repair loss due to dissipation of energy into space. These considerations lead the physicist to reasoning on complete systems. The author uses as an illustration 'the circulus of water,'-the final restitution, through rainfall, of water lost from a reservoir. So we may regard the history of the world as an uninterrupted succession of changes. Is this order fatal or is it reversible? We know at least that heat is capable of producing movement and that movement produces heat, and it is this reciprocal relation which led to the formulation of the principle of the conservation of energy. This principle raises questions which demand exact observation of transformations and the discovery of a common measure for different kinds of energy. A reservoir of water represents an available fund of energy which can be expressed in terms of two independent variables, the extension, i. e., the amount of water available, and the intension, i. e., the degree of fall possible. Applying these terms to other forms of energy we can say that one temperature is higher than another when it manifests a tendency to pass from the first to the second, and in a similar way we can apply the terms higher and lower to different conductors of electricity. By using these terms in this sense a scale of intensities can be established. Carnot has done this for the problem of heat and M. L. Selme has shown that it is logical to apply this procedure to any form of energy. But in order to balance gain and loss in the transformation of one form of energy into another we need a common measure; this is provided by electricity, which can be produced from other forms of energy and turned back into them. When the science of mechanics began, everybody believed in the absolute existence of bodies; movements were interpreted in anthropological terms, men spoke of a 'cause' or of a 'force,' and every movement was regarded as an expression of an isolated force. These verbal explanations are necessary as long as we believe in a plurality of phenomena, but a thorough criticism of this notion of force inevitably leads us, in spite of the inherent pluralistic tendencies of language, to a universal monism. M. Selme has raised the principle of the conservation of energy to the rank of a theorem by giving it a rational demon- stration. Thus it is shown that the state of the world at any given moment is equivalent in terms of capacity for change to the state at the moment before. M. Selme has also demonstrated that Carnot's principle is a theorem and can be generalized to apply to the transformation of one form of energy into another; thus the old problem in regard to the degradation of energy is eliminated, for there is no degradation of energy. We must guard against taking for the whole universe our little world of human affairs confined within the thin veil of our terrestrial atmosphere. WM. E. BINGHAM.</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 447 Characteres generaux de la philosophic franfaise. V. DELBOS. Rev. de Met., XXIV, II, PP. I-I3. French philosophy is characterized by certain representative traits. The question is whether these national tendencies have necessarily hampered philosophy in its search for pure truth. One of the essential features of the French intellect is the striving for clearness in ideas and in relations between ideas. Clearness in scientific thought depends first on analysis, the ability to see the details; and secondly on synthesis, the power of seeing the whole. The true problem is to discover whether French philosophy has carried these two necessary processes of all philosophical thought to such a degree that they fail to keep in contact with reality. This, it seems, is not the case. Seen under a certain aspect, Cartesianism may appear the exaltation of the geomet- ric spirit, but Descartes is aware that thought is superior to geometry. French philosophers have realized that to penetrate to the heart of reality requires a singular application of certain faculties, not privileged or transcen- dental, but human faculties. Far from practicing the abstract formalism of which it is accused, French philosophy has constantly allied itself with the positive sciences; witness such men as Descartes, Malebranche, d' Alembert, etc. The tendency to view the intellect through its work in science is one of the decisive motives of our philosophical activity, a tendency which is closely connected with the study of the human mind. Descartes, Pascal, Male- branche, Maine de Biran among the philosophers have this faculty of pene- trating to the motives of the human soul. Through the fact that philosophy is so closely connected with the knowledge of human nature is explained the fact that it has never existed solely for contemplation but has always aimed to incite to action and has recognized legitimate human duties. If these are the characteristics of French philosophy one can truly say that it is without national prejudice. VIRGINIA BAKER. Kapitalistische Philosophie. FRIEDA WUNDERLICH. Ar. f. sys. Ph., XXII, 3, pp. 2I7-237. One of the phases of the materialism which has held a central position for the last fifty years in discussions of the history of philosophy is the theory, advocated by Marx, that the ethical, religious, and philosophical ideas of any period have their foundation and source in an underlying structure of economic conditions. This conception of history may be justified in part, and the method of investigation which it implies may be carried a step further, by showing how the capitalistic organization of the economic life of our own times expresses itself in modern theories of knowledge. The characteristic feature which differentiates present-day industry and business from that of all other periods is its fundamental aim to create the greatest possible surplus of profit for the producer. This aim expresses itself in intense competition between the owners of capital, and results in their attempt to reduce the price of labor to a minimum, and by means of the perfection of machinery to derive the</page><page sequence="6">448 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. greatest possible returns from the least expenditure of capital. Natural science and all the other achievements of the human mind are appropriated for the all-absorbing purpose of enlisting every power of nature in the service of mankind. Capital, money, and profit, which should be only the means of production, are made the whole end and aim of industry. Four modern philosophers seem to show the influence of this economic situation. The pragmatism of James denies the independent validity of theories, and asserts that their truth is determined by the practical consequences they have for life. For this philosophy, idealism and materialism, absolutism and relativism, determinism and indeterminism, are all alike except in so far as they affect the temperament, or private interests of the individual, and thus pragmatism expresses the individualism that dominates our economic life. Theories, which should be the end, are considered the means of thinking; and truth, which should be the highest value, is judged in terms of practical utility. Even religious ideas do not escape this philosophical anarchism. The belief in God is accepted when it can be made of use in the practical struggles of man, and is laid aside, like a machine in the economic world, when it no longer serves a purpose. Mach bases his theory of knowledge on the biological principle of adaptation and natural selection. Thought, as much as the other activities of life, is explained in terms of the struggle of the organism to adapt itself to the environment. In the earlier stages of evolution knowledge originates in the instinctive reactions of animals, and in the higher stages a more elaborate mechanism of adaptation is called forth by the greater com- plexity of the conditions of existence. Thus the starting point of knowledge is a biological necessity; its aim is the preservation of life; its means is economy. This principle of 'thought economy' is also emphasized by Aven- arius and Ostwald. The former holds that the necessity for thought is found in the desire to economize energy. It is obvious how the image, the representation, and the concept accomplish this purpose, and all science and philosophy are more comprehensive applications of the same principle. With Ostwald, however, the principle of 'thought economy' receives even more emphasis. According to him all human activity consists in the usurpation and transformation of energy to fulfill the purposes of mankind. Thought, the state, and all the economic and social institutions are expressions of this principle. Although these philosophies bear a striking resemblance to capital- ism, they also show the influence of natural science, particularly of Darwinism, and cannot, therefore, be described merely as the result of economic conditions. F. W. A. MILLER. The Fundamental Laws of Arithmetic: Psychological Logic. FREGE. Monist, XXVI, 2, pp. I82-I99. Logic and psychology are confused by logicians. Logical laws are fre- quently translated as psychological laws of belief. As psychological, they merely tell what happens in the psychological sphere. But laws of logic have an objective import which goes beyond psychological happenings. Benno</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 449 Erdmann is a type of modern logician who makes logic a description of what happens psychologically, and who conceives truth as the general agreement of those who judge. But truth is independent of belief, and logical laws are concerned with objective truth. Erdmann deals with notions (Vorstellungen), and his logic cannot contain anything objective, because he concerns himself with the way in which judgments and agreements are psychologically formed, rather than with how they ought to be formed. Laws of logic are laws of objective truth, not natural laws of human belief. It is necessary to admit the existence of an objective domain which is not a domain of actual things. The non-actual is not necessarily subjective. This is especially true of numbers, which have an objective reality although they are not actualities. D. T. HOWARD. Mr. Balfour's " Theism and Humanism." A. S. PRINGLE-PATTISON. Hibbert J., XIV, 2, 54, pp. 268-286. The central problem of Mr. Balfour's Theism and Humanism is the relation of 'origin' to 'value.' Mr. Balfour rightly assumes the truth of the working body of root-beliefs upon which we all act in scientific procedure and practical life; e. g., the belief in the uniformity of nature and the aesthetic and ethical judgments and sentiments of man. The task of philosophy is to discover what these beliefs presuppose or imply. A criticism of such common knowl- edge leads ultimately to theism. In this as in other of his writings Mr. Balfour attacks the dogmatic complacency and illogical procedure of naturalism and agnosticism. Naturalism leaves the emergence of our beliefs in rationality, goodness, and beauty, and the emotions which gather around them, in- explicable, and renders their persistence impossible. The source of morality and knowledge must itself be moral and rational. The facts of human experience are only intelligible in a theistic setting. God is the condition of the possibility of cognitive and ethical experience. Our beliefs about the world and our beliefs about God are interdependent. The categories most fitly expressing this point of view are providence and inspiration. Although from an analysis of knowledge we may infer that to found reason on unreason is intrinsically incoherent, and from an analysis of our aesthetic judgments and our ethical beliefs and practice we may infer that beauty and morality are not accidents, but are founded in the deepest nature of things, neverthe- less, according to Mr. Pringle-Pattison, this does not in itself suffice to settle such questions as the personality of God or establish popular religious beliefs. " Perhaps the most that can be accomplished by such philosophical prolegom- ena is, by ruling out the various forms of naturalistic theory, to provide a congruous setting for science, morality, and art, and also for the higher religious life in which these main tendencies of our nature attain their con- summation and consecration. And that is exactly how Mr. Balfour has consistently described the scope and purpose of ihis intervention in the philosophic debate." RAYMOND P. HAWES.</page><page sequence="8">450 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. Le probleme religieux et les sciences psychiques. E. BOIRAC. Rev. Ph., XL, 4, PP. 3I3-326. The psychical sciences, hypnotism, animal magnetism, telepathy, spiritual- ism, though still unable to cope successfully with many of the problems presented to them, yet, such as they are, offer a useful contribution to religious problems. The history of religion is full of strange phenomena, many of which seem to be just such phenomena as are taken account of by these new mental sciences. The stigmata of St. Francis, visions, religious ecstasies, divine inspiration, resemble hypnoidal phenomena. To magnetoidal phe- nomena correspond the imposition of hands, to which importance is attached by Christianity, and the miracle of the woman cured by touching Christ's garment. Telepathy would seem to be a key to the explanation of prophesies and the gift of language; while bilocation, apparitions and like phenomena belong to both the sciences of religion and the psychical sciences, and one may hope that the latter will aid the former in determining their true signifi- cance. But whatever progress these mental sciences may make, it seems impossible that they can ever solve the fundamental problems of religion; that they can ever account for the religious sentiment in man, or make known the nature of God. D. T. HOWARD. Ethics as Science and as Art. GEORGE CLARKE Cox. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., XIII, 8, pp. 204-2I9. With due recognition of the metaphysical nature of all scientific presupposi- tions, we may treat ethics as a science, in the sense of "an ordered knowledge of natural phenomena and of the relations between them." The most explicit program for such a treatment has been proposed by L. Levy-Bruhl. The problem is not so much to establish standards or norms as to discover how men come to have certain standards. The method of natural science is as applicable to the discovery of the growth of norms as it is to the discovery of laws, and is calculated to teach us, not how to conform to a certain set of ethical rules, but how to behave wisely in society. The author is preparing a Case Book in Ethics, which will use much of the material of sociology, law, etc., but which will have its own specific purpose, i. e., to contribute to the study of the rela- tions of men and groups of men, considered as organisms. Such a study of cases of conduct logically precedes other studies, such as biology, religious psychology, etc., contributory to an investigation of the problems of moral responsibility. Together with the theoretical part of ethical science should go a practical part, an art of ethics, including, for instance, directions as to the control of the will such as may be found in Edwin B. Holt's The Freudian Wish. MARION C. CARROLL. Die Freiheit und die gegenstdndliche Welt. FRITZ MEDICUS. Kant-Studien, XXI, I, pp. 26-4i. The article begins with a quotation from Eucken declaring that the truth of knowledge must have its deepest ground not in preoccupation with the</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.] SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 45I object but in spiritual creation, in the formation of character. What follows is largely an exposition of Eucken's point of view. The Kantian philosophy has given a new turn to the problem of freedom. Although it is not solved we can at least see now that we cannot solve it by proofs of the impossibility of freedom in the objective world. Nor can we speak of the freedom of the individual, meaning the de facto individual, taken as object. Man is free for himself, but only as a member of a community. Reality indeed does not originally consist of individual objects. Man is rather from the beginning a member of a universal life process. But the innermost essence of man and of the whole world is his freedom. This is not 'given,' but proposed (aufgegeben), in the sense that it lies with him either to live actively in and through the proc- ess of reality or be a passive fragment in its organization. Freedom is the task of a community. In the effort to lift the moral burdens of the com- munity, we must be guided not by abstract ideals of perfection, but by the possibilities of concrete reality. In the stress of the present war, the 'neutral,' being removed from the actual situation, tends to be lost in sentimental individualism, to look for the rational instead of the actual, for abstract humanity instead of nationality, and so may fail to realize the moral value of war. We must be men not in the abstract, but here and now, not in a changeless Absolute, but in our particular historical setting. But given our circumstances it is our responsibility to penetrate them with living spirit. It is indeed through meeting the objective world by an effort of the will that we get the content of our personality. The tasks which lie for us in things are what make them reality for us. We cease to think of 'things' as external to us as soon as we think of the 'I' not as shut up to itself but as the sharer in a common life. Each unconquered or unspiritualized 'thing' injures the life of the community. Each time a 'thing' is transmuted, grasped in its full reality, an enriching of the common life takes place. Every man has originally in himself much that ill qualifies him to be a free sharer in the tasks of the common life. He must put this phase of himself over against himself, and by conquering it bring it into the service of the community. Freedom and the validity of the objective world do not exclude each other. The overcoming of the objective world gives freedom all its substantiality. Objects certainly have their place in this life, but life consists not in them but in overcoming them, making them belong to the life of the spirit. MARION C. CARROLL. Die Begriindung einer idealen Weltanschauung. KARL SKOPEK. Ar. f. G. Ph., XXII, 3, pp. 235-256. The present paper deals with the origin, nature and evolution of religion, and with the meaning of Christianity for civilization. A previous paper has shown the idealistic tendency of philosophy and science; that the spiritual alone is real; and that there is a continuous, series of monads, each striving for greater perfection, which culminates in man as a self-conscious or personal being possessing religion, art, and science. The origin of religion is not to be</page><page sequence="10">452 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. found in man's impotence, or in priestcraft, but in his need for a causal explana- tion of everything in spiritual terms. Thus arose animism. Thales said that everything was full of gods; Plato held the same view. The idea of animism was strengthened by primitive man's experience of dreams, death, fainting, etc. Thus he came to believe in gods with whom he could identify himself in the mysteries. The Evangelists brought this idea into the Gospels; especially was this the case with Paul, who knew the Mithra-mysteries, in which the idea of Communion is found. Animism is the first stage of religion. The essence of religion consists in the belief in higher powers and in the feeling of dependence upon them. The decline of polytheism was followed by the belief that there must be one being higher than the old gods. Thus in India the unity of all existence was recognized in the Rigveda. The Upanishads take the position that this unity which lies at the foundation of everything is the Self, the Brahman-Atman, the Absolute. The ancient Greeks attained to monotheism through Xenophanes. Socrates believed in an all-wise, all- powerful God, who stood to the world as the soul to the body, and who directed all to the well-being of man. For Plato, God was the Idea of the Good, the source and light of the world, which he described as possessing aseity, and as eternal, immutable, etc. Plato's immortal service to religion consists in placing the center of gravity in morality: the unjust man is hated by God, the just loved. Aristotle's God was pure Form, immanent in the scale of existences in which Form is progressively realized, and yet, in principle, tran- scendent, and thus pure Thought of Thought, the motionless cause of motion. The ancient Israelites only gradually attained to monotheism. Jahve was at first only a tribal god among others. The prophets elevated this tribal god to the ethical level. But it was Jesus who first conceived God as the loving Father of all men. The modern tendency to emphasize this world, and the outcome of science estrange many from Christianity. We must lay aside the husk of formula and dogma surrounding Christianity, and recognize the precious treasure it contains. Our Christianity is colored by the Chris- tology of Paul, to whom Jesus became the Philonic Logos, pre-existent, present at creation, far above the old gods of Greece and Rome in conception, who appeared on earth to redeem man from the Adamic sin. This latter idea Paul borrowed from the Rabbinical theologians. These Pauline ideas were foreign to the doctrine of Jesus as expounded in the Synoptic Gospels. Jesus taught, primarily, ethical perfection, to be attained by Love. This ideal of Love is the highest ideal and will triumph over the ideal of the Superman. W. CURTIS SWABEY. Dreams as Psychical Explosions. J. C. GREGORY. Mind, N. S., No. 98, PP. I93-205. Dreams often, if not always, disturb our sense of the duration of time; this disturbance acts in the one direction of lengthening the apparent duration of the dream. The essential characteristic of dreams seems to be a rise of consciousness. Since the circumstances of the dream through awakening are usually those most completely known, it may be taken as a norm for com-</page><page sequence="11">No. 4.1 SUMMARIES OF ARTICLES. 453 parison. Such a dream shows an explosive rise of consciousness as the char- acter and condition of its origin; the mind pushes back all experiences except the impression made by the original stimulus. This principle, when applied to other dreams, suggests a satisfactory interpretation of their nature and origin. The intensity of the mind's activity exaggerates the sense of duration. In the dream, consciousness achieves a creation. Some dreams may be centrally initiated, but it seems certain that some peripheral stimulus is usually in operation. ELLEN B. ARMSTRONG. Das Gewissen. DR. FRIEDRICH BODEN. Ar. f. G. Ph., XXII, 2, pp. ii8-I33. There are two fundamentally different systems of ethics. The one depends for its moral precepts on the dictates of an inner voice or intuition called conscience, the other on the carefully thought out rules of the intellect. Conscience, since it does not recognize or base its judgments on fundamental principles, tends to rely upon free-will as opposed to the intellect. Its opposi- tion to conscious thought connects it with the sphere of inclination and instinct. That all other human characteristics become merely side issues when compared with it and that it is in his conscience that the real man is revealed, is an irrefut- able theory that claims a large number of adherents. On the other hand the adequacy of the conscience as a substitute for intellectual judgments is very widely denied. Upon such a theory a teacher, basing his actions entirely on the dictates of his conscience, can give no other reason for them. He cannot, therefore, prove his decisions to be better than those of the pupil with whom he disagrees. The only course open to him is an appeal to universal experience and if in addition to the decisions of the individual conscience, even though they be considered fundamental, certain universal principles are also accepted, the conscience-ethics is open to very little criticism. If the environment under which a conscience has been developed suffers a radical change there is danger that it, no longer recognizing itself, will become confused. An ethics which tends to evaluate the contents of the understanding will, then, produce better results. The man who neglects the practical side of his life for the sake of his conscience runs the risk of destroying his usefulness. "The statesman who consults his own conscience has little prospect of saving his people from external plots and internal difficulties." The conscience-ethics is a "morality for millionaires" and is impractical for the man who is engaged in the daily struggle for existence. CHARLES H. WRIGHT. Religion and Society: A Critique of Emile Durkheim's Theory of the Origin and Nature of Religion. A. A. GOLDENWEISER. J. of Ph., Psy., and Sci. Meth., XIV, 5, pp. II3-I24. According to Durkheim, the religious inspiration cannot come from nature nor can fundamental religious conceptions be derived from dreams or similar illusory experiences. The reality underlying religion is society itself. He regards Totemism as the primitive religion., He says that the ordinary life of the Australian is monotonous, but that under the excitement of certain ceremonial activities he is transformed. He feels himself carried away by</page><page sequence="12">454 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. a superior power. This experience is the basis of religion. Durkheim over- looks the fact that natural phenomena have always produced profound religious emotions. His derivation of religion from society is also open to objections. Many tribes do not possess this complex social organization and elaborate ceremonialism. How does Durkheim explain the origin of their religions? Durkheim believes that the 'religious thrill' arises from crowd- psychological situations. The emotions are intensified; the higher mental processes are paralyzed; and the instinctive and reflexive responses rise into prominence. But the specific emotion is not born of the crowd, and differs in different situations. The feeling may be joy, fear, hatred, or religious adoration. A crowd-psychological situation may intensify and even trans- form a religious thrill, but it cannot create one. The special religious expe- riences of many tribes, moreover, take place when the individual is in isolation. The great religious leaders often shun the crowd and live in solitude. These cases refute Durkheim's theory. MELVIN RIGG. The Formulas for State Action. A. K. ROGERS. Int. J. E., XXVI, 3, pp. 323-338. Three formulas for state action have been popular in recent times. (I) The laissez-faire doctrine wished to restrict governmental control (a) because of governmental abuses in the past; (b) because of the growth of industry and the consequent prominence of its competitive principles. (2) The 'general good' doctrine arose as a protest against definite evils resulting from the practice of (I). Both (I) and (2), however, are vague formulas, and ambiguous as to the limits of government. Furthermore, men emphasize 'the general good' when they are sacrificing themselves in social conflict rather than when they are working constructively according to individual bent. Collectivism tends to sink men in organizations. The 'good' must be ultimately the good of individuals. The real question for democracy is: what constitutes this good? (3) The 'equal opportunity' formula opposes a rigid definition of this good by a paternalistic system and recognizes the need for restriction, while calling for such positive state action as will facilitate individual development. Special or class legislation is admitted as tending directly to equalize conditions. But the aim should be to produce a world with the richest variety of human life, so that interference is called for only when a real incompatibility between ends can be demonstrated. The formula recognizes and would allow opportunity for differences in power. A theory which wishes to sacrifice the average man to the genius cannot easily convince the average man. On the other hand any tendency to level down the standards of living must be combatted. The principle of equal opportunity does not commit itself on the questions of money reward or of right to hold office, but definitely does not justify a 'right to power' of one man over others, except by consent, for practical purposes, or by rational persuasion, since its final emphasis is on the individual.
