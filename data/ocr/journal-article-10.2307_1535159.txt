The introduction by the editor explains that this book is "dedicated to a fresh look... by scholars who do not espouse standard views and answers" at the emergence of monotheism in the ancient Near East and its dating (p. 15). She notes the familiar point that "the text of the Hebrew Bible is the prod- uct of a long, editorial process" and that its "final shapers were monotheistic and they wanted the inherited traditions to reflect their own religious beliefs in a single creator deity, Yahweh, who had at his command various lesser divine beings who also populated heaven, the angels" (pp. 16-17). She sketches "a working hypothesis" that from c. 960 to 586 B.C. Judah "had a national pantheon headed by the divine couple, Yahweh and Asherah", and "Yahweh was king of a whole heavenly host that included lesser deities who did his bid- ding" (pp. 19-20). The Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires regarded Ashur and Marduk, respectively, as "the king of the gods", under whom were other gods of Assyria and Babylonia and the gods of defeated peoples. In con- trast, the Persian empire equated the gods of conquered peoples with Ahura Mazda under the title of 'elohe hassdmayim-a development described by T.L. Thompson as "inclusive monotheism". "The plural form of the word for god in this new title might well be a deliberate attempt to express the multiple specific manifestations that the abstract category of head of pantheon could take" (p. 22). Edelman even suggests that "the use of the designation 'Elohim' as an alternative to the deity name Yahweh in the biblical texts reflects the theology of inclusive monotheism and therefore, cannot predate the Persian period" (pp. 22-3-a bold claim). In the Hellenistic period, "inclusive mono- ? Koninklijke Brill, Leiden, 1997 393 Vetus Testamentum XLVII, 3</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS theism seems to have given way to forms of exclusive monotheism", which "rejected the existence of multiple manifestations of such a deity in favor of a single manifestation: Yahweh" (p. 23). This "seems to find full expression in the official religion endorsed by the Hasmonean state" (p. 23). She suggests the use of the following terms: "national" or "First Temple Yahwism" for Judah c. 960-587 B.C. (not 586, as on p. 19), "intertemple Yahwisms" 587- 515 B.C., "Second Temple Yahwism" 515-143 B.C., and "earlyJudaism" 143 B.C.-A.D. 70 (p. 24). L.K. Handy argues that polytheistic beliefs were usual in pre-exilic Judah and Israel, in the official cult no less than in popular religion. He suggests analogies with the religious beliefs of the Ugaritic texts, in which he finds a "four-tiered hierarchy": (1) El and Asherah, the "highest authority"; (2) the "major active deities", Baal, Anat, Shapshu, Mot, etc.; (3) the "craft deities"; and (4) the messengers (pp. 33-6). He maintains that a similar hierarchy existed in Israel: (1) Yahweh and Asherah; (2) "Baal, Shemesh, Yareah, Mot, and, perhaps Astarte", and also possibly Anat (p. 39); (3) Baal-zebub (though "not a deity of the Judahite or even Israelite pantheon") and Nehushtan (p. 41); and (4) the mal'dkfm. The 'elohim in Ps. lxxxii, etc., are "deities of the higher orders", not "angels" (p. 38). Handy notes that Y. Kaufmann and W.F. Albright have been followed by some in maintaining that Israelites "in the first half of the first millennium B.C.E. were essentially monotheists", but recognizes that not all scholars have held such a view; perhaps more could have been said about earlier scholars who saw monotheism as a later development. H. Niehr advances a working hypothesis about the development of Yahwism and sets out his methods. He distinguishes between primary and secondary sources, i.e., those contemporary with the events recorded, on the one hand, and those from a later time, on the other; and he regards the biblical evi- dence as at best a secondary source for the pre-exilic period. His view of the pre-exilic period is certainly radical. He dismisses "the concept of a Davidic- Solomonic empire", and thinks that "Judah became a state only during the 8th century", and that "historians must reckon with the existence of a modest Judahite chiefdom before that time, which was politically and economically dependent on Tyre" (p. 53). "Omri founded the state of Israel according to the standards of his Phoenician overlords" in the 9th century (p. 56). Niehr bases his reconstruction mainly on external evidence, especially inscriptions, and thinks that greater importance should be attached to first millennium sources than to the Ugaritic texts. He thinks that Yahweh's "origin can be traced back to the hill country of Midian/Edom, where he was venerated as a local weather god like Hadad or Baal", and that the way in which he came to be worshipped in Jerusalem and Samaria "can no longer be reconstructed" (p. 52). Yahweh came to be worshipped as yoJeb hakkribim (under Phoenician influence) in Jerusalem, and had Asherah as his paredra. In Samaria, he was also accompanied by Asherah and was worshipped as Baalshamem, also under 394</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS Phoenician influence. We should not, however, suppose that "YHWH in Jeru- salem was identical with YHWH in Samaria" (p. 52); such an identification "took place in Jerusalem only after the fall of Samaria in 723" (p. 59). Josiah's reformation was intended "to strengthen his authority over Judah by several administrative reforms", including "the concentration of all Yahwistic cults in the temple of Jerusalem" (p. 59), not to purify Yahwistic worship by remov- ing foreign elements. After the exile there was an "attempt to create a new religion in the wake of Josiah's administrative reforms" (p. 60), and it is that religion that predominates in the O.T. The previous paragraph gives only an outline of the working hypothesis which Niehr works out in greater detail. It is impossible to offer here an ade- quate discussion of his hypothesis, but it may be remarked that it is certainly hypothetical and contains elements that are speculative. One notes, for exam- ple, that Niehr is prepared to present a view of early Yahwistic religion despite his scepticism about the biblical sources. On p. 58, he thinks it "clear that YHWH's worship as Baalsamem in Samaria is... to be connected with his later designation as 'god of the heavens' in the Elephantine papyri". (Incidentally, this view is not the view expressed elsewhere in this book that the phrase "god of the heavens" was derived from the Persians.) Yet the phrase 'lh smy' at Elephantine (cp. 'elah smayyd' in the book of Ezra) is not identical with b'l smm, and it remains a controversial question whether the beliefs of those who described themselves as yhdy' at Elephantine in the 5th century B.C. can be identified with those of people from North Israel three centuries earlier. Niehr's reconstruction is open to serious doubt. Nevertheless, he draws attention to genuine problems that need solutions based on reliable evidence, and his essay may serve as a stimulus to further thought. B.B. Schmidt advances an interpretation of O.T. texts about images that he describes as "tentative" (p. 77). His discussion is based on the following definition of "aniconism": it "refers to the imposition of a ban against the use of anthropomorphic, theriomorphic, or physiomorphic images to represent or house the deity as an object of worship in ritual performance" (p. 77). Passages in the Pentateuch forbidding images are interpreted as prohibiting "concrete depiction of animals, humans, and the greater and lesser lights were elimi- nated as acceptable symbols and receptacles of YHWH", but "inanimate objects, floral forms, and part animal, part human composite images were not" (p. 96). Passages about "lifeless idols" in the O.T. reflect a monolatrous view of Yahweh and a belief that "his 'legitimate' form [of image] and its accompanying rituals of animation were... superior to... those of other cults" (p. 91). In Mesopo- tamia and Egypt, images needed such rituals before they became alive, and Schmidt thinks that two "biblical traditions are highly suggestive of acceptable traditions of ritual animation" in Israel (p. 91). The first is that of the veil worn by Moses, which Schmidt associates with the cloud that "descended on the tabernacle" and "the veil or mask" which "might have formerly functioned 395</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS as a divine image" (pp. 91, 93). The second is the cloud of incense in Lev. xvi 2, 13, which "may .. have served to compel the deity to take up resi- dence not just in the adytum where the ark was located but also in the image provided for that purpose" (p. 95). Readers will form their own judgements about the probability of these arguments. The second part of Schmidt's article defends the view that such an accept- able image may be discerned in a picture on a pithos from Kuntillet 'Ajrud that shows two standing figures, which are regarded by some scholars as rep- resentations of the Egyptian god Bes, but which Schmidt believes to represent "Yahweh and his Asherah" and not to be dissociated from the inscription: brkt 'tkm lyhwh smm wl'srth. In his argument for the identification of the standing figures, he says: "I draw upon redaction criticism as an appropriate analogy when I suggest that for the 'final redactor' of the scene on pithos A, the confluence of figures and inscription may have in fact conveyed a significant, unified field of meaning!" (p. 97). The argument seems to be that the person who added the inscription (whether or not he was the same person as the artist) "consciously sought to interpret the drawings as a depiction of Yahweh and his Asherah" (p. 98). The author of the inscription thus corresponds to the redactor of a biblical text in the argument. Since, however Schmidt is "Assuming that the parts comprising the final scene are to be related as a single unit" (p. 97), the argument seems to be no more than a statement of part of the initial assumption. As Judith M. Hadley points out (VT 37 [1987], p. 207), "the pithoi are covered with all sorts of inscriptions and drawings, which are evidently the work of many different people", and there is no pre- sumption that the inscription and drawing here are related. Schmidt gives reasons for his assumption of a connexion between the draw- ing and the inscription on pp. 98-102. While he acknowledges that there are characteristics of Bes in the standing figures, he does not regard the fact as evidence against his identification because of the "fluidity" in the imagery used "for representing distinct deities" (p. 99). The figure on the right is shown with breasts and he thinks that, although Bes figures sometimes have breasts, their absence from the figure on the left suggests a contrast between the two and argues that the one on the right is female. Further, there are analogies for the overlapping of an inscription and a picture when there is reason to believe that the two belong together. Schmidt's arguments are open to question. First, it would be strange if the characteristics of Bes were to appear on a major goddess like Asherah; and Schmidt may exaggerate the significance of the absence of breasts from one figure and their presence on the other, for even he recognizes that figures of Bes sometimes have breasts. If, as Pirhiya Beck argued, the figure on the left is a later addition (see Hadley, pp. 194, 207), then the significance of the differ- ence becomes even more questionable. On the other hand, Schmidt does not comment on the possibility that both standing figures have beards (Hadley, 396</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS p. 192). Second, if the drawing is related to the inscription, there is a dis- crepancy. As Hadley (p. 207) points out, "there are three figures [in the draw- ing], but only two are mentioned in the inscription", and Schmidt does not account for the lyre player. If the figure on the left is a later addition, then the original number of figures is reduced to two, but the later figure is the one identified by Schmidt with Yahweh. Third, the pronominal suffix on wl'srth tells against the view that Asherah here is a proper name (Hadley, p. 207; GK ? 125 h; cp. 33 c, 127 a). Schmidt (p. 97) seeks to counter this argument by making "the point that such suffixes occur on personal names in other Semitic languages". But this inscription is in Hebrew, not another Semitic language, and l'srth can be explained in accordance with Hebrew usage by understanding the Asherah here to be a wooden symbol, not the goddess her- self. The existence of a symbol may reasonably be regarded as evidence for belief in a goddess behind the symbol, but that is not the point. It is rash to postulate a construction found nowhere else in Hebrew when the inscription can be understood in a way compatible with attested Hebrew idiom. If the reference is to the symbol of the goddess, then the drawing does not match the inscription. T.L. Thompson's essay, "The Intellectual Matrix of Early Biblical Narrative: Inclusive Monotheism in Persian Period Palestine", begins by commending J. Van Seters's "rejection of any possible context for the pentateuchal tradition within the time periods reflected in Genesis-II Kings" but finds "circularity of argument" in his "assumption that there is a historical exilic period to which he assigns the tradition, but such a period is unknown apart from the tradi- tion" (p. 107). Thompson believes that we should "begin, not from theory, but from the foundation of what is known historically about the tradition" (p. 108). He notes that 2 Macc. ii 13-14 refers to "a collection of writings [made by Judas Maccabeus], understood as traditional,. . . that had survived the Macca- bean wars", and to "the library of Nehemiah that was lost in the distant past" (p. 109). This "suggests that the author knows of no earlier collection of writ- ten tradition that survived the Maccabean wars", and "offers a serious argu- ment against understanding the final redaction of the Hebrew Bible as a whole significantly prior to the second half of the 2nd century B.C." (p. 109). Thompson analyses the biblical traditions into three categories. First, there are "surviving fragments from the past... even as early as the Assyrian period" (p. 112). Second is the "world view of inclusive monotheism". He sees here similarities to Greek and oriental thought in the Persian period, and ideas that "were still very much alive in the middle of the Hellenistic period" and later (p. 114). (It is not clear why p. 115 refers to "the Yahu/Elohaya of Elephantine" and the "use of Elohaya Shamayim by the Persian administration" in the Ele- phantine papyri; the transliteration looks like what may be termed "Hebramaic".) Thompson seeks to relate various biblical passages to this world view. Third, the "world view of exclusive monotheism" is seen as an "ideology... apparent 397</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS in ancient texts from as early as the efforts by Xerxes to consolidate and cen- tralize the government's control over religious ideology by banning religious associations that were perceived to pose a threat to the centralizing thrust of imperially supported dogma" (p. 122). Thompson finds such a world view in "some biblical traditions, especially parts of Ezra" (p. 123), and in the Macca- bean rising. "The need to reject syncretism and the dominance of Greek culture in exclusive monotheistic terms created a need to affirm the indigenous tradition of inclusive monotheism in exclusivistic anti-hellenistic terms" (p. 124). T.M. Bolin discusses the significance of the phrase "the God of heaven" in the correspondence in the Elephantine papyri about the rebuilding of the temple of Yahu. Yedoniah's letter (A.E. Cowley, AP 30 and 31) seeks per- mission to rebuild the temple and writes of 'lh smy' (AP 30.2, 27-8; 31.2 [smy' restored]) who is identified with yhw in 30.26-7; cp. yhw mr' smy' (30.15), and yhw 'lh (30.6, 24, 26; 31.7, 24-5). In the reply by Bagohi and Delaiah the phrase 'lh smy' is used, but there is no mention ofyhw. Bolin relates the phrase "the God of heaven", here and in the book of Ezra, with "official Persian reli- gious policy during this time", which "was inclined towards an inclusive mono- theism (belief in a single god of spirit, with regional refractions) centered on Ahura Mazda" (p. 128). "In an effort to have a sympathetic ear for his appeal, Yedoniah ... equates the local god yhw with Ahura Mazda through use of the appellative 'Ih' nsy'... Persian imperial policy at the time named no other gods but Ahura Mazda in official texts and had ceased making such equations between regional deities and the high god"; it is therefore "Yedoniah's responsibility to make this equation for the Persians" (pp. 139-40). It is strange that, although the phrase 'Ih mny' is correctly quoted by Bolin on pp. 135, 136, 140, the anomalous form 'lh' mny' (for which 'Ih' smw' on p. 133 is presum- ably a mistake) is given on pp. 127, 133, 135, 140, 141. Presumably, too, the divine names given as btl and 'nt on p. 141 represent the forms byt'l and 'nt, respectively, which are the ones used in the papyri. P.R. Davies observes that "Judaism in the Second Temple period... is now frequently represented as a pluriform phenomenon" (p. 145), and that some prefer to write of Judaisms rather than of a single Judaism. But "The plural Judaisms' requires some definition of Judaism' in the singular, in order itself to have any meaning" (p. 151). He finds several suggestions unsatisfactory, but thinks that the proposition that Judaism is the culture of the people of "Judea" is "worth exploring", and that leads him to distinguish "between Jewish' and Judean"' (p. 151). He rejects the "notion that the Jewish scriptures provide an account of the earliest form of Judaism, or form its historical foundation" (p. 154), and also that the work of Ezra and Nehemiah is the "foundation of Judaism" (p. 157). Davies thinks that "Ezra... remained separate from Nehemiah until the end of the 2nd century B.C.E. at the earliest" (p. 158). He looks at the account of the Jews given by Hecataeus of Abdera (c. 300 B.C.), and also at Ben Sira, who "does not know the five books that constitute the Pentateuch in their now 398</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS canonical form" (p. 170). "The 'law which Moses commanded' is probably only Deuteronomy (in some form)" (p. 171). The "Maccabean revolt" was important "for the definitive transition from Juda-ism ... to Judaism" because "it took the form of a religous war ... Some apparently fundamental elements of Judaism emerge here as key issues in the religious struggle-circumcision diet, sabbath, holy books... These practices ... become dominant character- istics of Judaism in due course" (p. 173). From the time of the Hasmoneans "there are not only several 'Judaisms' but authorized and unauthorized Judaisms, central and peripheralJudaisms, priestly and non-priestly Judaisms, because of the identification of certain religious practice with the state" (p. 178). "The catalyst" for the development of "a set of competing and ever more religious definitions" of Jewish culture was "the religious character that the 'Maccabean revolt' was given" and the Hasmoneans' "adoption of a religious ideology in support of their bid for power" (p. 181). Finally, Diana Edelman discusses the minting of coins for the province of Judah from the Persian period to the end of the Hasmonean dynasty with ref- erence to the use or non-use of representations of gods, and to the relation of such coins to the prohibition of images in the Second Commandment. She notes that coins appeared with representations of Athena, and she sides with those who identify a figure on one coin with Yahweh. This coin "appears to have been minted under the governorship of Bagohi", and "the possibility that he issued the coin as a repressive measure cannot be ruled out" (p. 204). The presence of representations of Athena and her owl "is to be explained either in terms of the nonexistence of the Second Commandment at this time or as a nonchalant attitude by the local Yehudian elite or populace in general about the prohibition against representation of deities other than Yahweh" (p. 204). Or the other hand, the existence of some coins without Athena or her sym- bol suggests that there may have been "periods... during which some sort of aniconic pressure was being brought to bear by a faction within the commu- nity" (p. 204). After the end of the Persian period, it "is probably significant that the mint in Yehud/Judea removed the symbols of deification from the bust of Ptolemy I as well as his titles that bore divine overtones" (p. 209). Under the Seleucids, however, coins bore "a picture of Apollo"; and from Antiochus IV "the por- trait of the king gained symbols of divinity" and "the image of Apollo was replaced by one of the enthroned Zeus Nikephorus" (p. 210). Only Antiochus VI among later Seleucids "chose to portray himself as a god", but images of various gods continued to appear (p. 211). Before the Hasmonean state be- came independent, its coins did not bear images of gods, although the picture of Antiochus VIII had a radiated crown, which was "a symbol of divinity" (p. 213). After achieving complete independence, the Hasmonean rulers had no representations of gods. Edelman carefully sums up the way in which the evidence is best interpreted. The book ends with a bibliography, and indexes of biblical references and 399</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS of authors' names. This is a challenging book, and it is to be hoped that it will stimulate further discussion. The quality of the articles varies in quality, and not all achieve the lucid and objective presentation of the evidence in Edelman's essay, or her careful consideration of different ways of interpreting the mate- rial that she describes in a judicious way. Of course, not all aspects of the rise of monotheism can be fully discussed in a book of moderate length that already deals with so many questions, but there are some surprising omissions. For example, one would have expected a discussion of such passages as Isa. xli 21-4, xliii 10-12, xliv 6-8, xlv 18-21, which are commonly thought to reflect "exclusive monotheism" and which are dated by most scholars (though per- haps not by Thompson?) in the exilic period, long before the 2nd century B.C. Cambridge J.A. Emerton Armin Schmitt, Wende des Lebens: Untersuchungen zu einem Situations-Motiv der Bibel. BZAW 237. xii + 326 S. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin-New York, 1996. Mit dieser Arbeit greift A. Schmitt, ordentl. Professor an der Kath.- Theologischen Fakultat der Universitat Regensburg, ein Thema auf, auf das er bereits bei der Behandlung von Ps. lxxiii im Rahmen seiner Habilitations- schrift' gestossen war und das bei seiner Beschaftigung mit dem Abschnitt Weish. i 1-vi 212 erneut seine besondere Aufmerksamkeit erregt hatte. Es han- delt sich um das Phanomen eines tiefgreifenden Wandels, der sich zwischen den Positionen zweier kontrarer Gruppen vollzieht, um eine Umkehrung der Ereignisse (reversal of fortunes, renversement de la situation). Diese Thematik tritt in den protokanonischen wie auch in den deuterokanonischen Schriften des AT in der Form der Gegeniiberstellung von Guten und Bosen bzw. von Frommen und Frevlern auf. Beide Gruppen stehen dabei unter einem ganz verschiedenen Schicksal; wahrend die Frommen sich zunachst in einer ungliick- lichen, notvollen Lage befinden, geniessen die Frevler das Gliick und die Freu- den des Lebens. Die Situation jeder Gruppe erfaihrt jedoch, nachdem in der Verhaltensweise ein Hohe- und Wendepunkt (turning point) erreicht worden ist, einen totalen Wandel: Die einst unterdruckten, machtlosen Frommen gelan- gen zu Ansehen, einflussreicher Stellung und Belohnung durch Gott, wahrend die zuvor machtigen Frevler aus ihrer Stellung sturzen, ihren verfehlten Lebens- weg eingestehen und Strafe erleiden. Nach der Darstellung einiger Schriften wird dabei die ungerechte Verteilung von schlechtem Ergehen und gutem Befinden ohne eine nahere Begriindung als gegebene Situation vorgefuhrt bzw. eine unmittelbare Konfrontation der vom Gliick begiinstigten Frevler mit den von Unheil heimgesuchten Frommen vermieden (so ausser in Ps. lxxiii; Weish. i 1-vi 21 auch in Mal. iii 13-21; 1 Hen. xcii-cv).
