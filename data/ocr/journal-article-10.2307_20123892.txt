<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION* OMAR K. MOORE AND ALAN R. ANDERSON I An a regent paper [7] we introduced the notion of an autotelic folk-model and made some suggestions concerning applications of the idea. Our purpose here will be to spell these suggestions out in more detail. But in order to forestall a certain kind of criticism which we feel is irrelevant to our enterprise, we would like at the outset to mention some similarities between our heuristic position and certain systems of what we will call "synthetic" phi losophy (for example, Whitehead's metaphysics). One striking point of similarity is this: there is a sense in which we feel we do not know what we are talking about. By this we mean that our remarks to follow do not constitute a theory. And as evidence for this contention we cite the fact that we have no logically valid arguments to support what we say. To be sure, we believe ourselves to be in very good company in this respect, at least as far as the behavioral sciences and systems of synthetic philosophy are concerned?we do not believe others know what they are talking about either (in the technical sense defined above). Whitehead, for example, gives us very few arguments in favor of his metaphysics?he just tells us how the world looks to him. In this paper we will be presumptuous enough to try to tell you how the world looks to us. At worst the picture we want to draw will be misleading; at best it may suggest some experimental or formal problems of interest. * This paper was presented at a symposium on Small Group Sociology held at Stanford University, June 20-24, 1961, under the auspices of the Office of Naval Research, Group Psychology Branch. The proceedings of the symposium are to be published under the title, "Mathematical Methods in Small Group Processes," edited by Joan Criswell, Herbert Solomon, and Patrick Suppes (Stanford University Press, 1962).</page><page sequence="2">410 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON Having delivered this caveat, we now turn to our topic. We will begin by summarizing briefly the principal thesis of our earlier paper, which is in part founded on the following two observations. We note (1) that there are very few theories, with any mathematical depth at all, which have been found to have applica tions in the behavioral sciences. These are principally theories of games of chance ("probability theory"), and theories of games of strategy (after von Neumann). And we observe (2) that each of these theories grew directly out of the study of autotelic activi ties?that is, activities undertaken by human beings solely because of their intrinsic interest. Engaging in social games, playing with puzzles or aesthetic objects, simply being sociable, are examples of activities we call autotelic, i.e., activities which are, or should be, undertaken solely because they are enjoyable. As regards the second point: the close connection between game theory and probability theory on the one hand, and social games on the other, is not open to question. It is simply a fact of history that for both theories, the first models to be considered were ordinary social games. But one may wish to raise doubts about the claim that social games and the like are autotelic (espe cially if one belongs to one of the more austere schools of social psychology according to which it is not possible for anyone ever to do anything just for fun). To such critics we make the follow ing minor concession (perhaps putting the matter in a way which will satisfy even the most puritanical) : even if no one ever does enjoy anything, the rules of our society make it clear that people are under an obligation to enjoy some things, at least. There are severely sanctioned rules, for example, to the effect that one should take part in sports only because one wants to play. We are all supposed to give short shrift to grand-Standers, cheaters, and people who "let the side down" or otherwise exhibit "bad form." And the rules governing autotelic activity, which have the effect of keeping the activity autotelic, are remarkably pervasive. We may not do business at a party; we may not go to the opera in order to be seen there by the right people; we may not join the country club simply to meet the right people. Rather: we must go to the party because we enjoy being sociable; we must go to the opera because we love music; we must join the country club</page><page sequence="3">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 411 because we like golf.1 People break these rules, of course; but it seems clear that there are such rules to be broken, and also that some behavior is autotelic in the required sense (i.e., that some times these rules are consciously complied with) .2 1 Arnold Lunn [17], for example, writes: The essence of sport is the invention of an artificial problem for the fun of solving it. Nobody plays golf because some obscure need is satisfied or complex resolved by putting little white balls into round holes, for if this were so people who were afflicted by this complex would just go round a golf course at dawn dropping balls into the holes. Golf is an artificial problem invented for the amusement of man, the problem of propelling a ball in the minimum number of strokes round an eighteen hole golf course, (p. 22.) 2 As we have mentioned, a folk-model must be inexpensive, and most of them obviously are, in the sense that little of importance hangs on victory (unless we are soreheads, or gloaters, i.e., poor sports). And where substantial personal risks may be involved, as for example in moun taineering, delicate problems arise in an effort to keep the matter autotelic. We would classify mountaineering (as a sport) as a "team puzzle model," and as a sport it is just as artificial as crosswords. We cite Lunn [17] again: The essence of mountaineering as a sport is the contest between the spirit of man and inanimate matter, and the key to all developments of mountaineering is the attempt to preserve the reality of this contest by weighting the odds against man. A virgin peak is a problem, but once the peak has been climbed new complications must be introduced in order that a contest, which would lose interest if the outcome were certain, may be renewed with redoubled zest. The conquest of new routes on peaks no longer virgin, guideless climbing, winter moun taineering and ski mountaineering are all expressions of the same search for new problems. Artificial difficulties are invented in order that the game may continue, for a game in which victory is inevitable soon loses its attraction, (p. 22.) It is not necessarily easy to understand the point that "risky" sports, such as rock-climbing or auto racing, must be surrounded by rules which minimize the risk if the activity is to be kept autotelic. R. L. G. Irving [16] quotes with understandable annoyance the following definitions: Here is an expert Teutonic climber's attempt: 'Sport is any activity which manifests itself by measuring force against resistance, and the motives of which are the attainment of personal distinction.' This is how an Italian climber regards it: 'The essential object of sport is the development and direct recognition of force and quality under clearly defined conditions.' (p. 123.) And nothing could more annoy a mountaineering purist than the introduction of extraneous elements into the sport. Again Irving: International rivalry is a noxious element to introduce into the</page><page sequence="4">412 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON Now the striking fact that both these mathematical theories, probability theory and game theory, have models not only in the autotelic activities which led to their development, but also in the successful conduct of the more serious matters of survival and welfare, suggests the possibility that in acting autotelically we are "modeling" our own more serious behavior. This idea seems to be at the bottom of "formal sociology," in the sense of Simmel [27], who talks, for example, about sociability as the "play form" of sociation: at a party we engage playfully in competition, coopera tion, deceit, love, hostility, and the thousand and one other forms that social behavior may take?but we play at it, for no stakes. The upshot of our previous paper can then be put as follows: It might prove fruitful to look at autotelic cultural products (puzzles, games of chance, games of strategy, plays, novels, and the like) as models in the folk-culture, or folk-models, of the serious concerns of survival and human welfare?models with the help of which we come to understand and "be at home with" our natural and social environments. So put the thesis risks banality; what gives the thesis such teeth as it has, is the fact that social games and certain serious (say) economic problems are models of the same theory (regardless of the actual behavior of players, buyers, and sellers), and so may be said to have a formal similarity suffi cient to lend some credibility to our contention. atmosphere of the Matterhorn. Rivalry becomes an ugly thing in sport when it is more than an encouragement to men to do their best, (p. 215.) And Lunn: It is not only in mountaineering that the Nazis (and now the Russians) have tried to transform a great sport into a criterion of the merits not only of national but also of ideological competition. Before Hitler came to power the German skiers were primarily skiers, and then, as once again today, a friendly element in our ski-ing family, but we all felt during the Winter Olympic Games of 1936, which were held at Garmisch, that the Germans had been mobilised to demonstrate the invincibility of the Third Reich. Elsewhere I have described the tense atmosphere of those games and my reactions when invited after refereeing the slalom, to broadcast a few comments. All I could bring myself to say to the unseen audience was "Germans, let me tell you a little secret. There are still some people who ski for fun." (p. 241.)</page><page sequence="5">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 413 II For the purpose of this essay, at any rate, we will ask you to assume that puzzles, games, and the like, are inexpensive models, with the help of which we come to learn about the world in which we live. Having made this heuristic assumption as explicit as we can, we will now try to show that it has some bearing on the topic of this symposium. In order to elicit these considerations we will first enlarge a little on interactional models, especially games of strategy. It is characteristic of social interaction that I cannot maximize my own utility without "taking into account" (in some vague sense which we understand only darkly) what you are up to. I must have some theories or intuitions about how you are likely to behave, how you will respond to my actions, and the like. Worse than that, I must be aware that you are very likely doing the same thing in regard to me, and I have to take that possibility into account as well. But of course you may know that I am aware of this possibility, and you adjust your behavior accordingly. And so it goes?we are both involved in a tortuous labyrinth of relations, and though we act in this way quite easily and freely, it is better than even money that neither of us could even begin to give an explicit account of how we do it. (It is the complexity of this kind of behavior, together with our inability to explain it, which lends plausibility to the suggestion that we learn to behave in this way by playing games of strategy. This is exactly the kind of behavior hide-and-seek (say) requires?but in hide-and-seek, failure to win is relatively inexpensive.) The interactional models provided by games of strategy may be contrasted with the noninteractional models found in puzzles. It is of course true that we can regard puzzles as one-player games ?but it still seems clear that puzzles do not share the interactional features of games of strategy. Once the conditions of a puzzle are set, they do not change on us suddenly with a view to thwarting our efforts at a solution; indeed this is exactly how we distinguish between "puzzles" and "games": no social interaction takes place between the puzzle and the solver. Now if we are correct in our estimate of the importance of</page><page sequence="6">414 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON such folk-models as puzzles and games of strategy for the process which sociologists call "socialization," we should expect that their influence would be pervasive, and that their presence in the backs of our minds might, in subtle ways, not only intervene in much of our thinking, but even constitute the warp and woof of many of our thought patterns. Acting on this assumption, at any rate, we shall now try to develop some plausible considerations concerning the relations between these folk-models and scientific inquiry. We observe first that both natural and behavioral sciences are, among other things, social enterprises, undertaken in a societal context, and that they both presuppose social selves (in the sense of Mead [18]), capable of social interaction. Now our own informal observations lead us to believe that the principal problems faced by (and produced by) infants, at least as they begin to learn speech, are interactional in character : the problems faced have to do with certain social rules, as laid down, enforced by, or exemplified by, other human beings. There are many examples: talking in accord with linguistic conventions, eating, toilet-training, playing to gether peaceably, respecting seniors, etc. All of these activities are rule-ridden,3 and it seems plausible to suggest therefore that social games should be prior, both temporally and in order of importance, to puzzles, in the socialization process. Even non interactional folk-models, say puzzles, presuppose social interac tion, in the sense that they require a social context, and an ability to understand the restraints put on those artificial problems we call puzzles. Indeed we find some support for the notion that interactional models have a deep hold on us from the prevalence of animistic thinking in so-called "primitive" societies. In fact it is hard to eradicate even in "civilized" societies; many research scientists half-believe Finagle's Laws (which presuppose that inanimate objects are out to get us). In social interaction we recognize that our opposite number is potentially friendly, potentially hostile, potentially indifferent, to us and our concerns. It would moreover seem quite natural, espe 3 The importance of the concept following a rule, especially a linguistic rule, has probably been recognized more clearly by Wittgenstein [33] than by anyone else in the history of philosophy, sociology, or psychology.</page><page sequence="7">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 415 cially in a state of ignorance, to endow nature with these same attributes. This is in fact a sound conservative strategy and one we have all followed from time to time. A person finding an inert bat on his doorstep does well to treat it as if it were alive until he is pretty certain that it is not. If we know little of nature generally, it might do trivial harm, and considerable good, if we treat nature as if it might, suddenly, turn on us.4 Now it seems to us to require a vertiginous act of abstraction to remove the interactional elements from our view of nature. "De humanizing" an anthropomorphic nature ought to require a siz able wrench, as experience with civilizing primitive peoples indi cates. It is therefore not altogether surprising that it took millenia of human history before the natural sciences developed, especially if it is conceded that physics demands an abandonment of animism. It is central to the classical Newtonian view of natural phenomena that they be regarded as isolated systems, which run entirely by themselves, and are not influenced at all by us. Nature is, in short, assimilated to a puzzle.5 People (as opposed to bodies) have been eradicated from the picture as ruthlessly and as completely as may be, and we are left with a mindless mechanism which dominated, and still dominates, the attitude of many working natural scien tists. No one of course can maintain that as a heuristic principle, 4 We note that this fiction of a hostile, animistic nature lies behind Wald's treatment [31] of confidence levels in the behavorial sciences. For a similar idea see Moore [19]. 5 It might be objected that a conception of natural processes devoid of social interaction was known to several early Greek cosmologists, for example Democritus, and that consequently we are on shaky ground historically. In reply we explain that we do not mean to hold the position in such a sharp form. It must at least be conceded that Homer and Hesiod had a view of nature which was pervaded by social interaction?and all we wish to claim is that the latter kind of view is likely to come first. Even so, the classical views which pervaded western attempts at science up until the scientific Renaissance were those of Aristotle which, if not involving social interaction explicitly, at least embodied many anthropomorphic norms. Planets moved in circular orbits because (as Aristotle and his colleagues seemed to feel) circular motion was the most perfect form of non rectilinear motion. And an early critic of Galileo's claim to have found an eighth planet cited in opposition the facts that there were seven deadly sins, seven cardinal virtues, seven days of the week, seven apertures in the head ?it stands to reason that there are seven planets.</page><page sequence="8">416 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON mechanism has been unsuccessful in the natural sciences?our astonishing theoretical and technological progress would seem to indicate that this is precisely the right view to take, as regards physics. In view of the success of the puzzle model in the natural sciences, it is not at all surprising that those interested in the behavioral sciences should have tried equally to remove people from their considerations. The principal thesis of behaviorism, at least in its early and crude forms, was that a human organism is a black box, subject to certain inputs and outputs, which should be studied like any other physical system. Social and psychological processes were to be regarded as isolated phenomena of a mechanistic sort, to be studied in complete abstraction from the social, inter actional context in which they occur. Such an attitude is at least strongly suggested by the preoccupation in the first half of this century with rote-learning experiments and psycho-physical meas urements, and more recently by attempts to simulate various kinds of problem-solving on computers. * * * In this section we have thus far been concerned primarily to push the "folk-model thesis" to the following point: there are important differences between interactional models, such as games (exemplifying social interaction), and noninteractional models, such as puzzles. Theoretical and technological successes in the physical sciences have "depended," in some sense, on looking at nature from the point of view of a puzzle model, rather than a social-interactional model; we may say alternatively that the puzzle model is appropriate to physics in a way in which the interactional model is not. For the purpose of continuing the discussion, at any rate, we would like again to take this (vague) contention as a heuristic assumption. Before leaving this topic, however, we want to make one further observation (again on the supposition that the differ ences between interactional and noninteractional models are of importance). To wit: it seems quite clear that the most important and impressive applications of descriptive mathematics have been in those areas where puzzle models are most appropriate. Of course</page><page sequence="9">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 417 it is true that we have enjoyed almost three hundred years of applications of high-powered mathematical methods to solve prob lems in physics, and we have devoted barely thirty years to the elaboration of the same kinds of methods in the behavioral sciences. In the latter case one may even genuinely doubt that the signif icance of such empirical results as have been obtained justifies the sophistication of the mathematical methods employed. Surely no one would argue that anything remotely like celestial mechanics has resulted from the mathematical study of human behavior; and we would still advise a person interested in the human condition to read DurrelTs Alexandria Quartet [12], rather than an equal number of volumes of some professional journal in the behavioral sciences. There is of course no a priori reason why this should be so; it may well be that the paucity of impressive results arises directly from the youth of the enterprise. After all, social scientists have been trying to apply mathematical methods in the behavioral sci ences for only a fraction of the time the physicists have had; maybe we have not yet located our Archimedes. Such at least is a familiar line of defense; we have used it often enough ourselves to have feelings of great attachment for it. Still, we have been saying this kind of thing for a long time, and it may be that things are ripe for those of us on the side of the angels to scrutinize the devil's claims a little more carefully (to draw on one highly-touted drama turgical folk-model). Ill We will now try to offer some reasons for thinking that the attempt to apply the descriptive mathematical methods appropriate to the puzzle model in the social sciences is (in a certain sense we should like to get clear about) a mistake. There are principally three considerations which move us to this feeling, of which the first is rather minor, though not without interest on its own account. 1. The mechanistic ideal of nineteenth-century physics has, even in the natural sciences, been crumbling in this century. Noth ing could be more foreign to that ideal than the notion that the position or velocity of the observer could make a difference to the</page><page sequence="10">418 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON observations (as relativity theory indicates). The same anti-me chanistic idea is implicit also in the Heisenberg Uncertainty Prin ciple, namely, that even making a physical observation jiggles things a little bit?the "totally isolated" system is affected even by being observed. Even Church's theorem may be looked upon as a limitation on what we can do. In short, even in physics and mathematics, people (or at any rate scientific people) are creeping back into the picture in ways unimaginable to natural scientists of the last century. 2. Secondly, and more important, there is a difference be tween the relation of a natural scientist to his subject matter, and that of a behavioral scientist to his subject matter, which seems to us to have received insufficient attention in the literature. One sometimes gets the idea that behavioral scientists would like to predict human behavior in much the way that a weather man predicts the weather, and to contrive mathematical theories which will enable these predictions to be even more accurate. What seems frequently to be overlooked is that though the weather is unlikely to change its character because we have made a prediction about it, people, on the other hand, are quite likely to change their behavior because we have predicted that they will behave in such and such a way. There is a delightful tale, no doubt apocryphal, to the effect that a group of freshman interviewees at Yale (for a psychological study) decided that each member of the group would manage somehow, in the course of the interview, to mention white horses. The group of subjects was substantial, and so was the consternation of the interviewers when they compared notes. The tangle was finally unravelled, owing to what we regard as weakness of char acter on the part of one of the freshmen. He confessed. But the episode illustrates a point: subjects need have no serious purpose in confounding a study in the behavioral sciences?they may do it just as a practical joke. (A "practical" joke is, by our reckoning, a non-autotelic joke, at least for the victim.) More to the point, it seems plausible to suppose that if people are given a reasonably good theory, which enables them to cope conceptually with a broad class of problems, they will use it, and in that respect, at least, alter their (perhaps social) behavior.</page><page sequence="11">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 419 There can be no doubt, for example, that the theory of games of strategy has been used occasionally in formulating policy, and it would seem that the resulting behavior could be sensibly accounted for most economically by the assumption that the persons involved knew the theory and were using it. In short, a decent theory is likely to influence the behavior of those who know it. Which means that our predictions of human behavior might go wrong if we tell our subjects all we know, i.e., if we give them the techniques required to solve the problems we set. (And notice that if we deliberately conceal our theories, we violate one of the ideals of the scientific enterprise, namely, that scientific results should be public; in principle, in the behavioral sciences, the roles of investigator and investigatee are interchange able. This is not true in physics, chemistry, or mathematics.) 3. Thirdly, the distinction between those who have puzzle models and those who have interactional models (in the backs of their heads6) seems to us to shed some light on a factional dispute among intellectuals, which has been causing uneasiness in certain quarters recently. We have in mind the kind of situation con sidered by C. P. Snow [28]. It seems reasonable to suppose that people who are concerned with, and perceptive of, the nuances of social interaction, and who think of the world as a place inhabit ed by others who are also experiencing major or minor successes or frustrations in the course of living their lives?people with such interactional preoccupations are more likely to become literary intellectuals: novelists, or playwrights, or psychoanalysts, or his torians. From this standpoint it is not difficult to see that what the black-box enthusiasts are doing must seem monumentally ir relevant to the important aspects of social human behavior. "Who cares about 'tests of significance' which are not tests of signi ficance? What could be a more blandly inane way to approach or evaluate any important aspect of our lives with other people?" To the scientific intellectuals, on the other hand, at least those 6 Of course we do not mean to suggest that people have only one, or only the other, in mind; we have already argued that anyone, to the extent that he is human at all, must have some interactional models in mind. But it may well be that models of one sort or the other predominate; a fact (?) which might be suggestive of a typology for the organization of personalities.</page><page sequence="12">420 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON who see nature and society through the same polarized lenses, the work of the literati must seem so much idle vaporing. "The concepts are not clear, there is a lot of wild talk about Minds, and Intentions, and Emotions, and the like?not a shred of anything that looks even remotely as if it could be treated as a puzzle, or mathematized in any way at all. No insights of any interest can possibly be gained in this way about anything, much less about anything as complicated as human behavior?so let's leave all that to the dilettantes, and get back to the old drawing board." Of course we have drawn the split more fiercely than it de serves; still, it seems clear that some such divisiveness is in evi dence; and differences among the kinds of models we have been considering look to us relevant to the dispute. IV Such, then, is a rough general picture of the role we believe folk-models to play, and the influences we think they have. We will now try to show that, immediate appearances to the con trary not withstanding, the foregoing considerations are relevant to our assigned topic, which has to do with applications of mathe matics in small group research. In particular, we will consider, from the point of view we have been outlining, a recent application of mathematics to social interaction. In an interesting book of a year ago, Suppes and Atkinson [30] report some experiments concerning two-player games, the results of which are then analyzed from two points of view: their own variant of learning theory (black-box heuristics), and game theory (social-interaction heuristics). The design of the study has the elegance to be expected from any work of theirs, and we find their interpretations of their experimental results of particular interest, since they are so sharply at divergence with our own. They write as follows: . . . we have been concerned with the application of learning theory to situations involving social interaction. From this standpoint, we have ignored concepts like friendliness, cohesiveness, group pressure, and opinion discrepancy, which have been important in the recent investigations of many social psychologists, and have attempted instead to explain the detailed features of social interaction situations in terms</page><page sequence="13">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 421 of conditioning concepts. The exchange of information between players in a game, for instance, can be successfully analyzed in terms of an organism's ability to discriminate between stimuli, the important point being that this information may be treated in terms of the notion of stimulus in exactly the same way that perceptual stimuli in a one person situation are handled. The social situation, qua social, does not require the introduction of new concepts. We do not claim that our experiments on highly structured game situations justify the infer ence that no new fundamental concepts are required to explain any social behavior. But we think it is important to demonstrate in empirical detail and with quantitative accuracy that no new concepts are needed for a substantial class of social situations, (p. 3) We need not discuss their experimental situations at length in order to agree with them that the results show clearly that game theory is less effective in predicting behavior (in the experiments they consider) than is the learning theory they apply. But their ex periments have one feature which leads us to question their more general conclusions. In order to eliminate stimuli which are difficult to measure (facial expressions, nuances of voice, body movement, etc.), and to get some control over the situation, players are separated by a screen, and communicate only by lights and buttons (which are in addition under the experimenter's control). The plays of the game then consist of various ways of pushing buttons, observing lights, and receiving rewards. Indeed in some cases there was no communication at all between players after the play began. Now it seems to us that the fact that game theory is less effec tive in these situations than the authors' learning theory, might lead to one of two conclusions: . . . social behavior may be analyzed without remainder in terms of the concepts of stimulus, response, and reinforcement and the processes of stimulus sampling and conditioning, (op. cit. p. 256.) or 2) the abstractions required to make learning theory apply (i.e., the control of stimuli, leading to elimination of any effect even of players observing each other) have in effect eliminated social interaction as between the players. We immediately anticipate two misunderstandings. We are not arguing that game theory is somehow superior as a descriptive theory for the experiments considered; it seems</page><page sequence="14">422 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON to us that the evidence presented by Suppes and Atkinson is con clusive on this point. We are questioning rather the broader claim that "The social situation, qua social, does not require the introduc tion of new concepts." (See the extended quotation above.) Nor are we arguing that black-box heuristics have no place in psychology; people engaged in basic research have a legitimate right to be interested in whatever interests them; and learning experiments certainly have the stability and informativeness re quired of scientific theories, however irrelevant they may be to (say) problems of formulating public policy, or the problem of designing an experiment. Our question rather concerns the role of "social interaction" in the experiments performed. We think the experiments did not involve social interaction in the sense meant by most sociologists and social psychologists; in evidence we offer two considerations. In the first place, the experimental arrangement was such that the only way in which the subjects could tell whether social inter action was involved, was from the words of the experimenter. In fact, each of the experiments could have been carried out in such a way that the experimenter was in complete control?issuing rewards and punishments entirely at his own discretion, and with out regard for plays by opposing players. We do not mean to deny, of course, that some social interaction was involved. There was certainly social interaction between the experimenters and the subjects, and between the subjects and laboratory personnel before they entered the experimental situation. (On this point see Criswell [11].) Nor do we deny that in certain formal respects, social interaction was present in the experimental situation, at least in the sense that game-theoretical notions could be applied. Nor do we mean to deny that it is of interest to see whether subjects can treat a situation as interactional even when the usual clues are missing, and the subjects have to be told that the situation is interactional. (Notice, incidentally, that the subjects must already have an idea of what is involved in social interaction in order to interpret meaningfully the information the experimenters provided about the game-like character of the task.) Nor, finally, do we wish to deny that experimental sch?matisations of full-bodied interactional patterns are of interest; one of us has himself done experiments that were highly schematized.</page><page sequence="15">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 423 But we do submit that when "social interaction" (in the important sense that everyone finds so difficult to explain) is really present, the situation involved in the experiments does not obtain. People do not in general need to be told that they are in an inter actional situation?an interactional situation bears its interaction al character on its face. This is the first of our reasons for doubting that social inter action was involved in the experiment. The second is as follows: In the experiments under consideration, the subjects were in the position of having to learn what strategies were (realistically, in terms of pay-off) available at all?as opposed to using inter actional strategies already available. We acknowledge of course that interactional strategies must be learned?a matter which is perplexing enough in its own right. But learning good chess strat egies inductively is a different enterprise from employing such strategies in a play of the game. It is clear that one important aspect of the task set for subjects in the experiment was that of learning strategies for playing the game. This fact alone might (possibly) account for the fact that learning theory applied. But as "social interaction" is usually con ceived, we do not say that A is interacting (as opposed to learning to interact) with B, unless A has some conception of the structure of the social situation of which he is a part, i.e., unless he has some idea as to how his actions affect his "utilities." This amounts in effect to having some strategies already in mind, which are relevant to the interactional encounter, and among which the participant may choose. The contention that social interaction may be "reduced" to individual psychology becomes even more dubious if we consider the probable result of letting the subjects in on the secret. Surely if, in those experiments where the pay-off matrix was displayed, the subjects were loyal to the experiment, and were on top of game theory, their behavior would have approximated the latter much more closely. With this last point we close our case. Suppose we grant that the success of learning theory over game theory in making pre dictions supports the view that no peculiarly social concepts are required to explain social interaction. Then parity of reasoning would seem to require that if game theory had been more success</page><page sequence="16">424 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON ful, then characteristically "social" concepts would be required to explain social interaction. But it is not at all difficult to imagine a situation in which game theory would be more successful than learning theory: namely, a situation in which (1) the subjects knew game theory, (2) game theory was applicable, and (3) the subjects used it. * * We hope to have shown, at a minimum, that the claim that social interaction requires (as we shall put it) no extra-psychologi cal concepts, is a philosophical, or methodological, or heuristic thesis, rather than a scientific theory. (We hasten to add that nothing that Suppes and Atkinson [30] say would require them to deny this minimal claim. They have, characteristically, been careful to qualify what they say. E.g., they write: The experimental problem involves exact and clear identification of the stimuli. At present, we may not always be able to identify the relevant stimuli experimentally, for many of the nuances of social communica tion and activity depend on a long history of verbal usage and inter action. Nevertheless, we are convinced that ultimately such an analysis can be provided, [p. 265.]) We hope we have also made it clear that we have no objections to black-box heuristics; as we remarked (in effect) before, any heuristic orientation which produces interesting and elegant results is welcome. But we do feel that no one has shown that extra-psychological concepts are unnecessary in explaining social interaction. Nor, of course, have we shown that extra-psychological concepts are nec essary. It is like proofs of the existence of dryads. No one has done it to our satisfaction; and in our heart of hearts we know that it cannot be done. But we have no proof that it cannot. Similarly we have no proof that specifically social concepts are required to understand social interaction. But we would like to turn now to some considerations which might lead one to believe that such is the case. V Consider the following problem. Suppose you were to find yourself on a lifeless moon, with no possibility of returning to, or</page><page sequence="17">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 425 communicating with, the earth. Suppose also that you were in a frame of mind to do something bad. What would you do? In informal conversation, this question has elicited a wide variety of initial responses, but after a little thought the answer generally settles on the following point: the only way to do some thing bad in those circumstances is somehow to break some rule. It may be moot whether there are any rules to break in the quasi solipsistic universe we are considering; the examples we have heard (spitting, say, or offending God, or oneself, by committing suicide) have a farfetched ring to them. But note that even this kind of outrageous rule-breaking is doing something against some one or something: the idea of rule-breaking in which no one (or nothing) gets hurt in any way seems, or seems almost, self-con tradictory. (See, e.g., Anderson [1], [2], Prior [25], or Nowell Smith and Lemmon [24].) We have, in this essay, been trying (from time to time) to appear to be sane arguers, and also (from time to time) to say what we believe, even without the kind of evidence we would like to have. Here we come on one of the latter points. The "conclusion" seems to us inescapable that self-consciously acting in accordance with a rule (or formulating such rule) is one of the fundamental aspects of social interaction, and any experimental studies which neglect this point simply have nothing to do with that topic. Indeed this is implicit in our earlier claims that social games of strategy are models of social interaction; obedience to game rules must be self-conscious. The whole point is, as Hume [15] says in comparing games with other social interaction: In societies for play, there are laws required for the conduct of the game; and these laws are different in each game. The foundation, I own, of such societies is frivolous; and the laws are, in a great measure, though not altogether, capricious and arbitrary. . . . The comparison, therefore, in these respects, is very imperfect. We may only learn from it the necessity of rules, wherever man have any inter course with each other. ... It is impossible for men so much as to murder each other without statutes, and maxims. ... (p. 210.) VI We have been trying to "establish" two points: (1) The descriptive mathematics appropriate to puzzle models simply does</page><page sequence="18">426 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON not fit social interaction; and (2) one principal characteristic which distinguishes group sociology from individual psychology is the concept of self-consciously following and formulating social rules. Now if we are right on the first point, one might very reason ably demand that we suggest some alternatives. If social inter action does not have the puzzle-like features appropriate to de scriptive mathematical treatment, then what are those of us who are interested in the scientific study of social interaction to do? One might incorrectly draw from our remarks the conclusion that we take a dim view of applications of mathematical or logical techniques in the behavioral sciences; this is far from the truth. In our earlier paper [7] we tried to suggest some ways in which formal analyses could be brought to bear on problems concerning human behavior. It seems to us, however, that the most fruitful approach is likely to be indirect. It is a mathematical common place that a satisfactory theory requires simplifying assumptions, and in a sense we have been arguing that folk-models are based on the same principle. We can look at chess as a quasi-mathe matical abstraction from serious social interaction, and so viewed it is not quite so surprising that a mathematical treatment of games as cultural objects is possible. Of course the theory of games is not a mathematical theory of human behavior; it is rather a theory of cultural objects which people have invented and (or so we claim) used to help shape their behavior. But without intending to minimize in any way von Neumann's monumental achievement in formulating the theory of games, it still seems to us that only the barest beginning has been made in the formal analysis of auto telic cultural objects. For example, the whole domain of aesthetic objects is virtually untouched. Even a complete analysis of existing folk-models would, how ever, still leave us with major problems. If we are correct in hold ing that folk-models constitute the theoretical arm of a society's culture, it would seem that in relatively stable, static societies, the theoretical problems have in this sense been solved (i.e., stability is ensured, granted no major changes in population, size, tech nology, etc.). And in a slowly evolving society, one might expect gifted individuals to come up with new models reflecting the changes. By and large, few societies have failed to develop socializ ing techniques sufficient to produce members of the society in good</page><page sequence="19">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 427 standing; on the whole the record for stable societies in the past has not been one of consistent failure. But presently existing folk-models are not enough. They have evidently been produced on a hit-or-miss basis, and in societies which have been stable enough to tolerate many mistakes. But we, in common with many others,7 feel that modern industrial societies, especially in relation to populous underdeveloped areas, are in a state of unstable, dynamic disequilibrium; and it seems to us doubtful whether we can risk continuing to be so haphazard in our construction and dissemination of autotelic socializing models. Traditionally, of course, no one has thought of a social scien tist's job as that of creating folk-models. The task for social scientists has been thought of as similar to the task of any other scientist?namely, to learn to predict, and in some measure control, certain aspects of our environment (however one may wish to interpret these vague words). But when the objects we wish to make predictions about and to control are other people, the goals of prediction and control take on a faintly ominous ring. To take the notion of control first, there are obvious senses in which we wish to control the behavior of others; criminal codes are designed to do just that. So are civil methods for obtaining remedies and redress. But one of the principal tenets of what we like to think of as a democratic society is that the liberty of action for individuals shall be restricted or controlled as little as possible, consonant with the continued existence of the society. There have been behavioral scientists who take the attitude that what is re quired is a strong effort to produce a society like that of Brave New World. (For a frightening example see Halmos [13].) But 7 We cite, e.g., Whitehead [32]: Our sociological theories, our political philosophy, our practical maxims of business, our political economy, and our doctrines of educa tion, are derived from an unbroken tradition of great thinkers and of practical examples, from the age of Plato in the fifth century before Christ to the end of the last century. The whole of this tradition is warped by the vicious assumption that each generation will sub stantially live amid the conditions governing the lives of its fathers and will transmit those conditions to mould with equal force the lives of its children. We are living in the first period of human history for which this assumption is false, (p. 117.)</page><page sequence="20">428 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON the idea of exerting this kind of fierce control over our fellow-men may well worry others as much as it does us. The control we wish to exercise, at least from the ideological standpoint we espouse, should be minimal. Again, there are obvious senses in which we wish to be able to predict correctly the behavior of others. We like to feel con fident that a taxi driver will take us where we tell him; we are pretty certain that if a person is dropped from an airplane, he will go down (rather than up) ; and it may be of interest to know how fast people can (on the average) memorize nonsense. We might even be interested in trying to predict with accuracy and in detail how people will solve serious and difficult intellectual problems, such as that posed by the Michelson-Morley experiment. Under this head we have two remarks to make. In the first place, if we could have predicted that Einstein would have come up with the Special Theory of Relativity, we would have been in a position to solve the problem ourselves. "What were the inputs?" we would ask. "Well, with those inputs, and with that history, we get the following outputs," we would answer. Our theory of behavior would then simultaneously have an enormous impact on both physics and international pol itics. Surely no one seriously envisages anything of the kind. Even those of us who have conducted experiments designed to enable us to predict some rather trivial aspect of human behavior have taken some pride in the novelty and ingenuity of our experimental design. We couldn't have predicted, two years before, that we were going to do just that, and we know ourselves as intimately as anyone does. Secondly, there is, from an intellectual point of view, some thing disappointing about the possibility of predicting how people will solve problems. We may sometimes be able to do it, of course. If a person really wants to know the solutions to the equation 5 x2 + 3 x + 2 = 0, and if he knows enough algebra, it is not hard to guess what he will do. But we also have the feeling that such problems are trivial. If we give someone an algorithm for a class of problems, it is reasonably to be expected that he will use it to solve problems in that class. The interesting problems, whether</page><page sequence="21">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 429 of an interactional or puzzle character, are the difficult ones?the ones that neither we nor others know the answer to. This observation brings us back to the "major problems" of nine paragraphs ago. We have pointed out that in stable, relatively static societies, we might expect folk-wisdom (and available folk models) to suffice for the job of socializing the members of the society. Familiar problems get codified, and abstract, schematized folk-models may be explored autotelically, so that members of the society can learn about various aspects of their environment in an inexpensive way. We would like to suggest that in a dynamic society of the kind mentioned earlier, something new in the way of folk-models will be needed. If we can't tell what kinds of problems are likely to face us, we can even less predict the kinds of solutions they will require. In such a situation it becomes urgent to supply not only new folk-models, but also models which will enable people to cope with situations in which the rules are continually changing. We are all familiar with the anxiety produced in children when they don't know what is expected of them (not that they necessarily do what they are required to do?but even when they don't behave, they know they are being bad). The stresses involved in (say) "civilizing" a group of "primitives" point to the same moral. Auto telic activities in which the rules are constantly changing may pro vide one way of acclimating people to a world of constantly and rapidly shifting norms. We began this section with a promise to offer some alternatives to the standard view of behavioral science as a program for predict ing and controlling human behavior; obviously our remarks thus far have been abstract and programmatic. As inadequate examples of the kind of thing we have in mind, we will conclude by mention ing some formal and experimental work that has been suggested by the heuristic considerations we have been trying to expound in this paper. (1) One of us has been constructing a family of dynamic autotelic responsive environments,8 designed to elicit creative 8 Accounts of the matter may be found in Moore [20] and Moore and Anderson [21], [22], [23].</page><page sequence="22">430 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON behavior on the part of children. These responsive environments are exp?rimentai, in the sense that they require experimental equip ment (e.g., a special purpose computer to serve as companion to the "subjects"), and of course children for the environment. It is also experimental in the sense that detailed records of the chil dren's behavior are kept. (And also, finally, in the sense that "experiments" in the narrower sense can, and will, be run.) But the studies and the heuristic considerations which motivated them are not offered as a "theory of human behavior." The experimental techniques stem rather from an abstract analysis of the cultural objects to which the children are to be exposed, and a rough formal analysis of possible kinds of environments. The principal aim of this work is to produce novel, creative behavior, and new cultural objects, both inside and outside the artificial environment. Harking back to our previous remarks about predictability, one can easily see that we would be deeply disappointed if the children's behavior was predictable in any detail. As matters now stand there is at least one thing we feel that can be safely predicted?the children will return to interesting responsive environments with apparent pleasure, though the option of not coming is always available. That is, these are "experiments" in which it is not necessary to coerce, cajole, trick, or hire subjects. In fact they learn more from the situation than the experimenters do.9 What is sought is an environment in which "subjects" emerge as (if anything) superior in some abilities to the experimenter, and are prepared to undertake and solve problems which are beyond the abilities of the experimenter. Ideally they would become experimenters of the same sort, and be superseded by their own "subjects." Of course this is a cooperative undertaking, with (initially) junior and senior partners?but the relation between subject and experimenter in the behavioral sciences has always been necessarily cooperative, if success is to be achieved at all (cf. the white horses mentioned in section III). 9 Mention should also be made in this connection of some elegant work of Suppes [29]; our own brief experience with these materials con vinces us that children enjoy returning to these books, and that experience with them is in that sense autotelic.</page><page sequence="23">SOME PUZZLING ASPECTS OF SOCIAL INTERACTION 431 (2) Cooperating, or operating together on some task, re quires two things: some idea of a goal to be attained, and some structure of rules within which the operation of attaining the goal is to be carried on. A second "application" of the general heuristic scheme we have been describing is in the formal or mathematical analysis of the notion of a rule. Before 1920, there were scarcely any attempts to apply formal techniques to anything of a normative character. (One might want to count probability theory as a counter-example, especially if it is associated with "degree of rational belief"?but other counter-examples would be hard to find.) The advent of the theory of games, and more recently of deontic logic,10 seems to indicate that a broader range of cultural object is amenable to mathematical analysis. Again, these are not "theories of human behavior"; they are rather an analysis of what constitutes "strategically correct" play for one who wants to win, or "correct" inferences as to what is enjoined, permitted, or forbid den by a set of rules. After some ten years of investigation by a number of people, the topic is still in a rudimentary state, but some aspects of the matter are becoming clearer. Five years ago it was not at all obvious how the relevance of one proposition to another could be handled formally. We now have at any rate one explica tion of the notion that seems to suffice for certain purposes.11 * * * As we see matters, one of the principal activities of social scientists will be, or should be, to continue the work begun (for our civilization) by Homer and Hesiod; i.e., to continue the job of constructing folk-models for the instruction and diversion of our fellow-creatures. We have no reason to believe that a more scientific, and less haphazard, approach to the problem will ensure success or even survival. But here again we are in good company; Bishop Butler [9] had misgivings too: And though it is our business and our duty to endeavour, within the bounds of veracity and justice, to contribute to the ease, conveni 10 See e.g. Anderson [3] and [4], Anderson and Moore [8], Casta ?eda [10], Hintikka [14], Rescher [26], and von Wright [34]. 11 See Anderson and Belnap [5] and [6].</page><page sequence="24">432 OMAR K. MOORE; ALAN R. ANDERSON ence, and even cheerfulness, and diversion of our fellow-creatures: yet, from our short views, it is greatly uncertain, whether this endeavour will, in particular instances, produce an overbalance of happiness upon the whole; since so many and distant things must come into the account. And that which makes it our duty is that there is some appearance that it will, and no positive appearance sufficient to balance this on the contrary side; and also, that such benevolent endeavour is a cultivation of that most excellent of all virtuous principles, the active principle of benevolence.
