<plain_text><page sequence="1">a Stone Metaphor of Creation By Denise Schmandt-Besserat ASTONE STATUETTE FROM CAIN Ghazal, Jordan, depicts a nude figure whose gender is not immediately appar- ent (Kafafi n.d.). No genitalia are indicated, and the breasts are flat. Clues that the subject may be female include the absence of mus- culature, abdominal fat rolls, and voluminous upper arms and thighs. The figure's abdomen is the focal point of the composition. Its enormous size, the way it projects in pro- file, and the gesture of cradling it all draw attention to the location of a woman's womb and unequivocally suggest that the figure is pregnant.1 Who then is this female exulting in her pregnant state? Who is her child? What did the figure mean to the Neolithic villagers? These are questions that nei- ther the artifact nor the shreds of evidence found at CAin Ghazal can answer on their own. In this article, I seek to address these questions by analyzing the context, technol- ogy, and style of the statuette. A comparison of this statuette's iconographic vocabulary to that of CAin Ghazal's clay fig- urines, as well as other early Levantine stone sculptures, invites an exploration of the mythological construct in which these figures may have been situated. Subsequently, this com- parison leads to a consideration of the role of pregnancy in ancient Near Eastern creation myths. To anticipate my con- clusion, I believe that the collected data as well as the archaeological context in which the statuette was found suggest that she partook of a long tradition of women as CAin Ghazal's diminutive statuette stands a mere 14 cm high in its present state. Yet this small carving, dating from about 6000 to 5500 BCE, offers an intriguing look into the belief system of the Neolithic villagers. Photograph by Z. Kafafi. procreators of both cosmos and vege- tation. This concept was central to the figurine's function. The Context An American-Jordanian team directed by Gary O. Rollefson and Zeidan Kafafi excavated the statuette in 1994 at CAin Ghazal (Kafafi and Rollefson 1994). This well known Neolithic site, now located near Amman, Jordan, was one of the largest Near Eastern settlements of its time. The village was occupied for over 2,000 years-between ca. 7250-5000 BCE-and hosted two major phases of occupation. During its first period, known as Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), CAin Ghazal was a prosperous agricultural community. Its population produced an extraordinary array of symbolic objects including large anthropomorphic stat- ues, plastered human skulls, female and animal clay figurines, and tokens used as counters. The stone figurine came from a stratum within the later Pre-Pot- tery Neolithic C (PPNC) occupation, dating from 6000 to 5500 BCE. This sec- ond cultural phase has been characterized by population decreases and a reduc- tion in human and animal representations. These changes are generally understood to be the result of a process begun by overgrazing, overfarming, and defor- estation which led to environmental degradation and local climate change (Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1994:44). This eventually caused decreases in productivity, population pres- sures, and a shift to nomadic pastoralism which finally yielded an impoverishment of the material culture (Rollefson and Kbhler-Rollefson 1993:33-42). The figurine was found in a context located far above the wadi floor in an area which was presumably situated on the outskirts of the ancient village. It was found in situ, lying face-down at the end of an approximately two-meter-long stone path that consisted of about fifteen closely spaced slabs. This arrangement suggests that access to the female image was by way of this specially prepared stone pathway. With the exception of a thin stone wall running roughly parallel to the path (possibly a courtyard enclosure) no other features were identified in the vicinity. Since excavators detected no structural remains near the figurine, it is possible that the sculpture had been displayed on a small platform made of perishable material such as reeds or wood. If this were so, we could surmise that the statuette fell face down when the ephemeral edifice collapsed, either after a conflagra- tion or after the abandonment of that part of the site. Near Eastern Archaeology 61:2 (1998) 109</page><page sequence="2">The Technology Excavators found the statuette covered by a thick mineral-deposit coat. Conservators removed c a portion of this layer so that the figurine's pink, veined limestone (Munsell 7.5YR 7/4) is now visible on its front and left side. Broken in antiquity, the head, calves (and feet ?) are no longer extant. In its present state, the statuette is 14 cm high, 5 cm thick, 5.5 cm wide at the shoulders, and 7 cm wide at the hips. The figure is carved in the round and equal attention was given to all its sides. The sensitive modeling is especially successful in translating stone into the fleshy, articulated parts of the body, such as the waist and shoulders, and is a testimony to Neolithic stone carving technology and artistry. The level of mastery indi- cates that carving in stone, at least in this small format using a relatively soft limestone, presented no obstacle to the early sculptor. As we will discuss momentarily, the sophisticated composi- tion is based on the interplay of lines and curves, making it unlikely that the shape of the original stone block dictated its finished form, as is usually implied for prehistoric sculp- tures. Instead, the complex design suggests that the artist may have initially created a model in a softer material, perhaps tuber, wood, clay, dough, or wax, before turning to the stone. In the absence of lithic replication studies, we can only speculate about the carving techniques employed (Wilke and Quintero 1994:33-60). Prob- ably, the sculptor pecked and chipped the limestone block with a stone tool in order to achieve a rough form of the desired size. The stone artist then disengaged the finer details of the female body by grinding selected areas with gritty stones. The transitions between volumes are remarkably exe- cuted and therefore are noteworthy. For instance, the arms do not end abruptly at the wrist, rather the hands seem to melt into the mass of the abdomen. A pointed tool engraved the grooves outlining the breasts, thighs, and fat rolls and, finally, rubbing stones of decreased roughness smoothed the surface. Dark red speckles (Munsell 2.5YR 4/4 reddish brown) along the right side, from the upper arm to the thigh, reveal that the statuette was once painted. The Style Nothing in this statuette's design should be considered an accident or a mere imitation of nature. Instead, the artist sculpted the female body according to an elaborate geometric framework. The form is constructed around a vertical axis that begins between the breasts and continues along the thighs. Shoulders, arms, breasts, fatty rolls, thighs, and knees are symmetrically arranged around this central vertical line; only the womb bursts out in the center as the focal point of the figurine. On the horizontal axis, deep, clearly marked grooves divide the body into three parts, with the abdomen again occupying the center. As a counterpoint to these axes, a triple set of diagonal lines brackets the stomach. Grooves descending along the breasts widen towards the abdomen, drawing the eyes to it. In the opposite direction, the little arms form a double set of parallels that emphati- cally end at the center of attention just below the pregnant womb. The most masterful aspect of the composition is the successful blending of a rigorous interior axial design with the outline of curves cascading along the shoulders, waist, hips, and thighs. Moreover, lines and curves combine to cre- ate geometric patterns. The semi-circle of the shoulders mirrors that of the fat rolls, enclosing the torso in a full circle. Tri- angles are another leitmotif. Breasts, lower arms and thighs constituted three triangles set in varying orientations. Finally, the tip of the abdomen and the two upper arms form a final triangle superimposed over the body. The sculptor specifically manipulated the female form in 110 Near Eastern Archaeology 61:2 (1998)</page><page sequence="3">order to showcase the bulging belly and bring the preg- nant womb into focus. Some body parts were entirely eliminated. Among these are genitalia, navel, elbows, hands, fingers, armpits, and neck. The chest and limbs are minimized. The breasts are flat, linear, and have no nipples.The result of this streamlined composition draws attention to selected fleshy parts of the body: the upper arms, thighs, fat rolls, and the inflated stomach. Proportions also are skewed in order to emphasize the abdomen. The enormous arms taper to an unnatural thinness where they extend over the stomach. The torso lengthens to match the size of the legs with the result that the womb occupies the center of the figurine. Addi- tionally, body volumes are shifted. The inversion of mass between breasts and arms is perhaps most remarkable; while the breasts are flat the upper arms bulge, round and voluptuous. Finally, the buttocks are lifted to the level of the abdomen. As a result, the woman enshrines her womb with her head bent, her thighs raised, and her arms folded. Iconography: A Comparison with the CAin Ghazal Clay Figurines CAin Ghazal produced a collection of thirty-six human clay figurines (Rollefson et al. 1985:83-85). It would seem to be significant that the villagers created female rep- resentations in both stone and clay and that the two genres have little in common. An analy- sis of their similarities and differences may provide clues to their respective impor- tance. To begin with, the clay and stone figurines belong to different :- periods. The majority of the clay examples date to the PPNB, ca. 7250-6000 BCE, a time when CAin Ghazal was a prosperous agri- cultural community. The stone statuette derives from the sub- : . sequent PPNC period, which is characterized by economic and cultural decline (K6h- ler-Rollefson 1988:87-93). Both stone and clay fig- urines depict humans, but in different forms. The clay versions are usually curso- rily executed; the body is reduced to a mere cone that is simply pinched at the base to form two pointed legs. In con- trast, the stone figurine was executed with careful planning. It displays a mastery of aesthetic prin- ciples such as symmetry and geometry. In particular, the triangles and lozenges intrinsic to the composition of the statuette are completely absent in the clay examples. Both types of figurines feature child bearing but in markedly different ways. The three pregnant females made of clay have prominent breasts whereas the stone figure is flat-chested. A pattern of impressions covering the surface of the clay fig- ure suggests that it was entirely draped with a garment which covered the whole body. In contrast, the stone figure seems overtly to emphasize nudity (Rollefson et al. 1985:83-85; Rollefson and Simmons 1984:19-21). The archaeological context of the two figurine types indi- cates they may have had distinctly different functions. The clay figurines consistently are found within fill, in layers mixed with ashes, charcoal, and other refuse, implying that they were thrown away because they had no intrinsic value or enduring use. in contrast, the stone sculpture was recovered in what appears to have been a deliberately for- mal context. As mentioned above, the figure may have ben displayed in such a way that villagers might visit it by means of the specially prepared stone pathway. The discrepancy in the number of stone versus clay fig- urines is noteworthy. The solitary stone statuette compares to thirty-six clay figurines. Clay representations were com- mon, but those of stone, rare. The choice of clay over stone implies potentially different functional intentions. Clay is a Near Eastern Archaeology 61:2 (1998) 111</page><page sequence="4">common, ubiquitous material. Pinching tiny figures from lumps of clay can be done quickly by hand without recourse to any tool. It requires no prior training or competence. If unfired, clay artifacts are exceedingly fragile and therefore have a limited lifespan. In contrast, carving stone denotes a concern for durability; it demands a commitment of time, energy and skill, and requires knowledge of a craft and a specialized tool kit. Perhaps this material was chosen over clay because the flesh-colored stone was endowed with mys- tical qualities conferring special powers to the sculpture. The size of the figurines also underscores their relative importance. The stone statuette is fully hand-sized. The clay figurines are minuscule, measuring only 3-5 cm, a size which surely precluded public display. The postures of the fig- ures suggest that they may have been handled differently as well. The seated position of most of the clay fig- urines implies that they were stable, and were meant to sit without support. In contrast, the stone statuette can neither stand, nor sit, nor lie. It had to be displayed with the aid of a seat or throne which held it upright. It may be significant that the figurine fits perfectly in the hand; the buttocks nestle snugly in the palm and the side grooves provide a place for a firm grip. Therefore, it is conceivable that statuette was primarily designed to be used while held in the hand of an individ- ual who presented it to an audience. In summary, this analysis of the thirty- seven anthropomorphic figurines of CAin Ghazal shows that both the stone and clay specimens depict human forms and sometimes exhibit char- acteristics of pregnancy. Otherwise, the two genres differ in treatment, style, chronology, context, number, technology, size, and shape. The more numerous clay figurines were made of a common material that required little investment of time and energy, and they were discarded with other refuse. This suggests that they were subject to brief periods of domestic use, probably related to magic-making activities. In contrast, the stone stat- uette's more durable material, its more complex technology, special context, elaborate form, and aesthetic composition, as well as its emphatic symbolism denote a valued artifact, destined for a formal, public function (Kafafi 1991:12-14). It is likely that the (Ain Ghazal female is part of the long tra- dition of female stone statuary known from excavations to have been used in temples and shrines (Foster 1993:33). As soon as inscriptions on statues, royal texts, temple invento- ries and hymns become available in the early historical period, they leave no doubt that female stone effigies, as a rule, rep- resented deities. Following Durkheim (1976:30), I prefer the term "spiritual beings...conscious subjects gifted with pow- ers superior to those possessed by common men..." to epithets such as deity, divinity, god, or goddess. The main function of icons was to personify some of the supernatural forces, suggesting thereby that they resided in the community and could be propitiated by cultic ceremonies, offerings, and Located on a hillside north of Amman, CAin Ghazal was one of the largest Near Eastern Neolithic settlements.

This role of cultic statuary is not difficult to grasp because it is peculiar neither to the Near East nor to prehis- tory, but instead is quasi-universal (Beaulieu 1993:241). 112 Near Eastern Archaeology 61:2 (1998)</page><page sequence="5">The geometric composition.

Iconography: Early Levantine Stone Statuary Although the PPNB clay figurines predate the stone stat- uette, they did not serve as prototypes. Instead, the antecedents of the CAin Ghazal female may be sought in early Levantine stone statuary. The first anthropomorphic representations consist mostly of pebbles carved in the form of a phallus (Per- rot 1966:figs. 2-3 and photos 11-12), and appeared in Natufian assemblages ca. 10,000 BCE. This same culture is also tradi- tionally credited (Cauvin 1978:118-19) with a small calcite statuette depicting a couple in coitus, their two bodies tightly clutched together (Neuville 1933:558-60). It is noteworthy that the theme of the embraced couple is unique to neither the Natufians nor to the Levant. The motif of the copulating cou- ple recurs, for example, in Anatolian sculptures of the seventh millennium BCE at (atal Hiiyiik (Mellaart 1967:pl. 83). When individual figures began being carved in the Pre- pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) within the Khiamian culture ca. 8500-8000 BCE, most were sexually ambiguous or even dual- gendered representations (Bar-Yosef 1980:193-99, fig. 3-4). Examples at Salabiyeh, Nahal Oren, and Gilgal apparently depict the body of a woman with a head barely disen- gaged from the shoulders, with facial features reduced to the brows and a long nose, and with a trunk ending in two stumpy thighs. However, the figures can also be viewed as repre- sentations of male genitalia: the nose and brows become the foreskin, the body is the phallus, and the thighs represent the testicles (Gopher and Orelle 1996:255). The dual-gen- dered style was not confined to the PPNA culture but was still alive as late as the sixth millennium BCE. For instance, at Shaar Golan pebble figurines still fused the male sex with the female body (Stekelis 1972:25-27, pl. 50:1,51:1,52:1). In fact, dual-gender, far from being restricted to the Mediter- ranean coast, was celebrated in a statuette as late as ca. 4500 BCE and as far away as Tepe Yahya in southern Iran (Lamberg-Karlovsky and Meadow:1970:14). Female sculpture in the Levant coincided with the begin- ning of agriculture in the Khiamian culture, ca. 8500-8000 Clay figurines from CAin Ghazal. Excavators unearthed over thirty-six clay figurines compared to the single stone statuette, suggesting the special nature of the stone female. Photograph by YousefZobi. BCE. These few PPNA stone figurines from El-Khiam, and Mureybet II depict women in an unusual way, without breasts, navel, or genitalia. The buttocks are often emphasized, producing the characteristic arched posture. Stylization becomes even more extreme in the following millennia, as shown by figures of Mureybet III in the eighth millennium (Cauvin 1978:121, fig. 25:3), Tell Ramad II (de Contenson 1966:170, 173, pl. 2C) as well as Ras Shamra V in the seventh millennium (Schaeffer 1962:154, fig. 1A). Figures from these periods are reduced to torsos with stumpy legs; their head, arms, breasts, navel, and identifying sexual characteristics are omitted. Only a single specimen from Mureybet features a vulva. These statuettes also display the triangular profile characteristic of the PPNA prototypes. It was noted above that representations of intercourse and dual-gender were not restricted to the ancient province of Palestine; coital figurines are attested as far north as Turkey, and dual-gendered representations as far east as Iran. The same holds true for the flat-chested female stone stat- uettes. For example, level VI A at (atal Hiiytik, ca. 6000 BCE, produced a figurine which, although far more naturalistic, still retains the same characteristic triangular profile and has no breasts, navel, or vulva (Mellaart 1967:pl. 80). It is note- worthy, therefore, that at (atal Hiiyiik and also at Hacilar, pregnancy is translated into the more informal clay figurines and not into the more complex stone statuettes. The fact that the Levant shares themes and styles with other regions demonstrates that the Mediterranean coast was not isolated. The stone images belonged to a pan-Near Eastern Neolithic phenomenon. The foregoing discussion should make it clear that the Near Eastern Archaeology 61:2 (1998) 113</page><page sequence="6">A Stone statuette of an embracing couple from CAin Sakhri, ca. 10,000 BCE (?).

CAin Ghazal figure is similar to the earlier and contempo- raneous statuettes in its choice of stone, art form, size, and triangular profile. Like the other female images, a woman is depicted with flat breasts, and no navel or genitalia. How- ever, the CAin Ghazal figure departs from the former tradition in significant ways. It is far more naturalistic, and, except for the hands and nipples, includes each and every part of the human body. It is novel in its representation of obesity with its exaggeration of the upper arms and abdominal fat rolls. More importantly, it was first in glorifying preg- nancy. The posture of the figure's arms, holding her womb, has no known antecedents. Finally, the CAin Ghazal figure surpasses her Levantine sisters with a more sophisticated composition; the skillful use of symmetry, triangles, and lozenges, endows the figure with an unmatched mystical quality. The CAin Ghazal female also inherited the theme of prop- agation from earlier examples (Cauvin 1994). The same concern with sexuality or reproduction is shared with the early Natu- fian phallic images, the copulating pair, and the PPNA dual-gendered figures (Perrot 1966:fig. 21:1, 10, 13.). In the CAin Ghazal figurine it has a new interpretation. This statuette did not feature dual-gender or intercourse, but a woman ready to give birth. In other words, it did not picture conception, but pregnancy. 32asm Stone statuettes of Salabiyeh IX, Nahal Oren, El- Khiam, Gilgal, and Mureybet II.

Mythology Exalted in stone sculpture, intercourse, dual-gender, and pregnancy played an important role in ancient Near Eastern mythology. Cuneiform literature offers manifold examples of child-bearing being used as a metaphor to express the mys- teries of origins. For example, the beginning of the universe was conceived as a divine procreation. Nammu, the lone primeval deity, gave birth to An-Ki, sky and earth, with no male partner (Wiggerman 1992:289-93). In other words, some Mesopotamian cultures viewed the ultimate beginning of the universe as the fruit of asexual (dual-gender) repro- duction. An-Ki was the tightly embraced, inseparable pair who, in turn, begat the various components of nature: water, wind, sun, moon, and stars. The idea that all existing things were ultimately the result of sexual conception per- vaded the ancient Near East. The Egyptian creation myths echo those of Mesopotamia. In one account, their demi- urge Atum had a progeny without a female, by masturbation. Among his children, the brother and sister couple Geb and Nut, Earth and Sky, embraced each other intimately until being separated by Shu, personifying Air (Hart 1990:14). In Mesopotamian traditions, the bounty of nature renewed with each season was also conceived of as being the result of divine sexual intercourse. Ki, one of the early female Mesopotamian deities, was credited with generating earthly vegetation by sleeping with An (Black and Green 1992:112-13). An even more prevalent tradition from the Sumerian to the Baby- lonian period held that Inanna/Ishtar was responsible for the seasonal germination of plants and the propagation of the flocks in the spring through intercourse with Dumuzi. Can Near Eastern mythology give clues to the signifi- cance of the early sculptures we have been discussing? Could the dual-gendered figures evoke primeval deities like Nammu? Could the loving pairs represent inseparable godly couples, antecedents of An-Ki or Geb and Nut? And finally, could the CAin Ghazal statuette embody a mythical female engen- dering fertile crops? These questions are warranted first and foremost by the fact that the myths recorded in the cuneiform literature were not short-lived stories. On the contrary, it is commonly held that the mythological texts recorded on tablets had their roots deep in the past, probably as far back as the prehistoric oral tradition (Postgate 1994:176-80). They were the product of the accumulated experience of innumerable generations and therefore express a timeless Near Eastern cosmology. The hypothesis suggested by these questions gains plausiblity because people of innumerable societies have used the tangible experience of sexual conception and pregnancy to explain the mystery of life. Conclusion: The Significance If the woman cradling her womb is indeed a metaphor of creation carved in stone, the statuette gives important insights into the rituals and beliefs of PPNC cAin Ghazal. It provides evidence that its villagers used icons as vehicles through which reverence for deities could be expressed. More- over, the importance of these divine images parallels the time and energy invested in carving stone. The context in which Near Eastern Archaeology 61:2 (1998) 115</page><page sequence="8">(atal HOiyOk Hacilar F .: iMureybet .

The similarities of the statuette with earlier PPNA and PPNB sculptures suggest that the sculptures served the same purpose, in accord with a long established cultic tradition. In particular, the peculiar trian- gular profile implies that the icons were displayed in a similar way, possibly on a small throne or, since they fit the hand so perfectly, held by an individual during cultic ceremonies. The older statuettes also reveal that the early farmers' pantheon included supernatural beings in the shape of preg- nant women, who differed from earthy females by having flat breasts, no navel, and no genitalia. More importantly, the fact that PPNC CAin Ghazal's figurine makers departed from the flat chested female representation denotes an evolution in symbolism. The occurrence of pregnant, obese woman may therefore indicate that the climate change and a dete- rioration of the environment stimulated a change in the cosmology. Pressing concerns for plentiful harvests and herd reproduction inspired a new cult which centered on life-giv- ing females. Acknowledgements I am grateful to Gary O.
