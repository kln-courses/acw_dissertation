<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER CONTRIBUTIONS Hominid Promiscuity and the Sexual Life of Proto-Savages: Did Australopithecus Swing?' by RICHARD G. WHITTEN Anthropology Program, University of South Dakota, Vermil- lion, S.D. 57069, U.S.A. 18 III 81 The evolutionary history and significance of human sexuality hold a continuing interest for anthropologists and others. Among those who have made suggestions concerning the sexual life of our ancestors and its ramifications for humans today are Freud (1918), Morris (1967), Sherfey (1972), Spuhler (1979), and Symons (1979). Some of these writers are more serious than others (as might be expected from the nature of the topic, of Western reading habits, and of the Western economy). For every hypothesis offered at any level of rigor, however, there is a willing and able critic. Comments on past speculations include Kroeber's (1920) response to Freud and his horde and Geertz's (1980) response to Symons and his sociosexology. Unfortunately, there is little direct evidence to suggest the sexual behavior and sexual response of our hominid ancestors. It is very difficult to predict soft-tissue sexual response from fossilized skeletal material. Moreover, studies of human sexual response are in their infancy and culture-bound (Katchadorian 1979), while studies of nonhuman primate sexual response are few and usually confined to the laboratory (Mitchell 1979). Such problems are underlined in Lancaster's (1979) careful review of sexual behavior and human evolution. Most researchers, in any case, have ignored primate sexual response per se in favor of studying sexual relations. Studies of mating patterns and their ramifications for sexual dimorphism or demography are much more popular than are studies of response (Alexander et al. 1979, Martin 1980, Lovejoy 1981). Yet it is clear that the fundamental basis of mating behavior among primates is the individual's self-rewarding sexual re- sponse. Strictly speaking, copulation for procreation can be done simply, similarly, and with a minimum of fuss. The com- pletely unnecessary, yet very large, range of primate mount postures suggests that a certain amount of play, learning, and reward is involved in primate copulation (for a macaque Kama Sutra, see Chevalier-Skolnikoff 1974 or Hanby 1976; for a human version, see Comfort 1972). Recent laboratory studies of primate sexual response (reviewed by Lancaster 1979) are identifying the nature of this reward. Social and ecological factors mediate primate sexual behavior, but without some kind of sexual response by at least one of the parties involved there would be no primate mating behavior at any level worth discussion. It is possible that we have underestimated the importance of the orgasm as positive reinforcement for primate behavior. Our prejudice may have something to do with our unconscious Western attitudes toward sexual behavior in general. "M &amp; M's" are a good way to reinforce anthropoid behavior, but we should be aware that an orgasm is better and has been available a lot longer. Speculations on sexual response and human evolu- tion are important and useful because they can stimulate thought and discussion on a topic central to primate experience. Although the danger of public misunderstanding is real, letting the matter of "sex" rear its ugly head in anthropology is neces- sary if anthropologists would claim to study humans and human nature (Marshall and Suggs 1971). 1 1982 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, all rights reserved 0011-3204/82/2301-0006$01.00. Human males and females respond to sexual stimuli some- what differently, and this sex-specific variation is difficult to understand given the hominid tendency toward reduced sexual dimorphism in other physical traits (Mitchell 1979:21-24). I suggest that its origin may be best understood as a remnant of an ancestral mating pattern, the best analog for which is the chimpanzee "promiscuous" mating pattern. The difference between human male and female sexual re- sponses are minor but impressive. Most interesting is the female potential for multiple orgasms during a single response cycle. Males, by contrast, lose erection after a single orgasm and ejaculation; continued orgasm for the male is possible only after a period of varying length termed the "refractory phase" (Masters and Johnson 1966:210-17). Given the culturally and personally appropriate arousal cues, males and females excite with near equal alacrity. Lubrication of the vagina and penile erection are related to similar processes of vasocongestion. In the presence of continued stimulation, a plateau period of sexual arousal based upon heightened vasocongestion and myo- tonia (muscle contractions) is present in both sexes. Orgasm is the sudden release of tension and relaxation of muscles, and in the male it is quickly followed by ejaculation. Under appro- priate and continued stimulation, the female may return to the plateau condition and thereafter experience orgasm again (Masters and Johnson 1966:chaps. 14, 17). Female variation in this cycle is not limited to multiple orgasm. Masters and Johnson have also identified the status orgasm, an orgasm without an identifiable plateau, and the minor orgasm, a pro- longed plateau period which does not peak with an obvious, single orgasm (Masters and Johnson 1966:127-37). From this research, female sexual response appears to be differentiated from male sexual response in its potential variation and, within that variation, in the capacity of the female for con- tinuous recycling between plateau and peak. The question needs to be asked: Why should there be any difference at all? Masters and Johnson's results may be due to sampling error or misinterpretation. Certainly more cross- cultural research is necessary before they can be acclaimed a discovery in universal human nature. If they are correct, how- ever, they remain to be explained, and one valid mode of expla- nation is evolutionary. Can an evolutionary situation be posited to explain the larger range of the female's response and her superior orgasmic potential? A traditional source of analogs for early hominid behavior has been reports on the behavior of free-ranging primate relatives, particularly the macaque, the baboon, and the chimpanzee (e.g., Washburn 1961, Lancaster 1975). Studies of nonhuman primate mating patterns are becoming more common, but sug- gestions concerning sexual response are still very rare (Beach 1978, Lancaster 1979). Not long ago, it could be stated without much fear of contradiction that human females were unique among primates in their ability to achieve orgasm (Morris 1967). Of course, it was also not so long ago that Western science still debated the existence, whereabouts, and moral implications of the human female orgasm (Sherfey 1972). Evidence is mounting that other female primates do achieve orgasm and that our doubts about this are largely a matter of research goals (Zumpe and Micheal 1968, Saayman 1970, Micheal, Wilson, and Zumpe 1974). The female macaque sexual response, for example, closely resembles the female human response (Burton 1971). Usually these nonhuman responses are elicited with the aid of mechanical devices; how- ever, the alacrity with which nonhuman female primates take up with an artificial penis and the responses thereby recorded require a minimum of anthropomorphism and leave little to the imagination (Keller 1980). This response and interest on the part of the nonhuman female is usually obscured in the field by estrus behavio&gt;r. It is clear now, however, that female chimpanzees have sexual interests at times other than estrus (Lancaster 1979:57). Male, not female, receptivity appears to Vol. 23 * No. 1 * February 1982 99</page><page sequence="2">determine whether or not copulation will take place. Male receptivity to sexual approaches is in turn dependent upon whether the female is exhibiting estrus cues such as pheromones (Micheal and Saayman 1968, Micheal, Kaverne, and Bonsall 1971). Chimpanzee behavior as recorded in the laboratory or in the field is often used as an analog for early hominid behavior but rarely for early hominid sexual behavior. Chimpanzee mating is "promiscuous"; that is, one estrus female may mate with any number of males. The term and the behavior are less than noble, and therefore those who would idealize our ancestry shy away from them. In chimpanzee troops, presenting gestures and occasional intromission can occur at any time, but com- pleted acts of copulation are most common if the female is undergoing estrus (Goodall 1967, 1971). At ovulation, estrus cues are examined by males, who respond with sexual arousal, intromission, thrusting, and ejaculation. Male response is brief, estimated to take only 10-15 seconds (Goodall 1971:94). Any number of males may copulate serially with the same estrus female (see, e.g., Goodall 1971: chaps. 7, 14). Although the term "promiscuity" is most often used for this pattern, "serial mating" would be as apt and certainly less value-laden. Variation in and exceptions to serial mating are also being noted (Tutin 1975). Apparently consort behavior, although not obvious, is present among free-ranging chimpanzees. Partner selection in these' consorts has a low correlation with male dominance and appears to be specific to individual personality and preference (McGinnis 1979). Consort relations are limited to the period of time involved with female estrus cues. McGinnis describes this consort or escort behavior as mostly male- initiated and -maintained; for example, while two males fought over consort rights with an estrus female, the female, apparently less interested in full-time sexually exclusive rela- tionships than they were, copulated with three other males (pp. 436-37). The time involved for male chimpanzees' intromission, thrusting, and ejaculation is, as I have said, very brief. The willingness of the female to accept multiple intromissions sug- gests that her response either demands a lengthier span of stimulation than the male's or is in some way enhanced by continued stimulation. What the female chimpanzee experi- ences is uncertain; however, behavior has recently been identi- fied in the laboratory which suggests orgasmic-like responses (Keller 1980). The chimpanzee pattern is hauntingly similar to the human pattern of response. The male enjoys a single and comparatively brief response. (Has this been selected for because there are others waiting in line?) The female response must allow for, and may even call for, sequential and multiple intromissions. A prolonged plateau period or even multiple orgasms in the female would be of selective value for such a pattern. This set of responses is a complementary one and (apparently) satis- factory to all involved. The male consort relationship would limit the female to brief and occasional sexual stimulation, and therefore its comparative rarity can best be understood from the female chimpanzee's point of view. This pattern can aid in understanding human response-the human male's lack of variation and the human female's variation-if we posit a similar pattern for our hominid ancestors. It is still not certain, of course, that female nonhuman pri- mates do indeed experience anything similar to human orgasm. Beach (1978), for instance, is unconvinced by recent research results. Some theorists have suggested that the female orgasm is unique to humans simply because it acts to enhance bonding between the sexes and pair bonding is understood to be im- portant for human evolution (Symons 1979). It is very difficult to understand female orgasms as a strictly human phenomenon, however, given the range of nonhuman primate mount postures already noted and the increasing evidence from laboratory studies. It is also difficult to understand how female orgasms could act as pair-bonding reinforcement, since from the fe- male's viewpoint an orgasm is not dependent upon a specific male. Female orgasm is much easier to understand as especially well developed in but not limited to humans. Like tool making, communication skills, and carnivorous appetites, female orgasm is a phenomenon present among several primate groups but most obvious in humans. In proposing a relationship between chimpanzee serial mating, our hominid past, and contemporary human sexual response, I do not suggest that humans today would be more personally satisfied with a chimpanzee approach to sex and sexuality. Sexual behavior is learned behavior for the higher primates in general and for humans in particular (for examples of the range of human learned sexual behavior, see Malinowski 1929, Mead 1950, Ford and Beach 1951, Marshall and Suggs 1971, and Hollander 1973). Did Australopithecus swing? If human response today and its implications for hominid serial mating patterns in the past are any indication, matters now point in the direction of a rather promiscuous past.
