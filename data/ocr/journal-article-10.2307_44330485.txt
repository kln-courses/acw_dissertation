<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Statements Arts are actually anthropomorphic. Business is often bilaterally baleful. Causality is a considerable cow. Desires are delightful as well as desperate. Energy in everything is everlasting. Freedom is frequently fairly fallacious. Growing girls go gay with gallantry. History has some horrible hermits. Illness is injurious only to idiots. Jokes are jealous and jazz is jolly. Kitchens are kinetic like kisses and kiwis. Love is laudable and lately laundered. Matrimony is mainly merry and miserable. Names are numinous and never negligible. Officers often open their orifices. Palaeontology is particularly painful. Quails are queer but quiet and queenly. Restless rovers are rarely repentant. Soles slide sideways in silent seas. Terrible tornadoes torture the terrain. Under umbrellas the uncles take umbrage. Various virgins veer into vinegar. Weary wallflowers wait wetly for wisdom. Xylophones excel in extemporisation. Yelling in youth is yesterday's yawning. Zen is as zealous as zebras and zinc. 18</page></plain_text>
