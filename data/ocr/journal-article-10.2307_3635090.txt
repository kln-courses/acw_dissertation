<plain_text><page sequence="1">OTHER RECENT PUBLICATIONS Other Recent Publications GENERAL IN A SERIES called Makers of the American Tradition, which Bobbs- Merrill is issuing, the methods of the biographer and the anthologist are combined in the hope of achieving a more concise and exact pres- entation "of what the great leaders of the American people have thought, said, and stood for." Perry Miller, Roger Williams (1953. xviii + 273 PP. $3.00), I. Bernard Cohen, Benjamin Franklin (1953. xxiv + 320 pp. $3.00), and Harold C. Syrett, Andrew Jackson (1953- 298 pp. $3.00) are the first volumes issued. With due respect for the formidable character of Williams' theology and much of his prose, Miller wisely decided to be more author than editor. The point he stresses is that Williams not merely symbolized religious liberty but was insistent that society respect sincerely held opinions, which is a succinct definition of the essential freedom. Franklin is so famous for pithy and self-revealing writing that it was almost inevitable that he should be allowed to speak with only a minimum of commentary. Jackson's letters and especially his messages to Congress likewise require little supporting writing, though Syrett adeptly sets the stage with the observation that Jackson's principal con- tribution was to demonstrate that democracy could be made more effec- tive by giving it leadership that was at once strong and mindful of the will of the majority. A revised edition of Clifford L. and Elizabeth H. Lord, Historical Atlas of the United States has been issued by Henry Holt and Company (xv + 238 pp. $3.00 in paper; $3.75 in cloth). Original documents on the Spanish effort thirty-seven years before Jamestown to plant an outpost in Virginia are the main component in Clifford M. Lewis and Albert J. Loomie, The Spanish Jesuit Mission in Virginia, 1570-1572 (Virginia Historical Society, 1953. xviii + 294 pp. $7.50). As a concession to printing costs, or to the supposed aversion of the</page><page sequence="2">92 PACIFIC HISTORICAL REVIEW reading public to footnotes and citations, the publishers of James Thomas Flexner, The Traitor and the Spy: Benedict Arnold and John Andre' (Harcourt, Brace and Company, 1953. x+431 pp. $5-75) have separated most of the supporting references and offer them in a 25-page offprinted pamphlet which those who want to do so may tuck into the printed book. In quite different vein is the supplement offered by the publishers of Ralph Lord Roy, Apostles of Discord (Beacon Press, 1953- xii + 437 PP- $3.75), which includes in its frank appraisal a number of political-minded clergymen from the West. If substantive errors are proved to exist in this book a correction by pamphlet is promised. Glover Moore, The Missouri Controversy, 1819-1821 (University of Kentucky, 1953. ix + 383 pp. $6.oo) follows the great debate on statehood for Missouri. With its central issue of slavery extension and with all the related issues that were brought in, the struggle epitomized the entire sectional controversy of the next forty years. Moore regards the com- promise as practical and wise. Some may think that the bow is drawn too far in the contention that the line of 360 30' should have been extended to the Pacific and kept inviolate until the South of its own volition did away with slavery. William Gaylord Rector, Log Transportation in the Lake States Lumber Industry, 184o-91r8 (Arthur H. Clark Company, 1953. 352 Pp. $1o.oo) deals with only one phase, but in some respects the key phase, of lumbering as carried on in the Great Lakes area. The larger timber of the farther west required modification of log moving methods, but much of the description here set forth in great detail is applicable to other areas as well. Charles Hirschfeld, The Great Railroad Conspiracy (Michigan State College Press, 1953. vi + 128 pp. $2.50) is the tale of a vendetta between Jackson County farmers and the Michigan Central Railroad in the early 185o's. The background of resentment and violence, of spies and counterplots is sketched in. Then the evidence is sifted on the trial of a dozen farmers for depot burning, the verdict of guilty, but the convic- tion of the community that the trial had been a frame-up. The treat- ment could have been that of a detective story, but the choice instead was to stress the social history. One element of modernity in the Civil War was the key role of rail- roads in the conduct and the winning of the war. In Victory Rode the Rails (Bobbs-Merrill Company, 1953. 419 PP. $4.50), George Edgar</page><page sequence="3">OTHER RECENT PUBLICATIONS 93 Turner shows that at the outset neither side fully appreciated the rail lines or knew how to use them to best advantage, whereas four years later the superiority of railroads at the service of the North was closely correlated with victory for the Union. Readers of Richard O. Cummings' The American Ice Harvests will be interested to pursue the story further in Oscar Edward Anderson, Jr., Refrigeration in America (Princeton University Press, 1953. xiii + 344 pp. $6.oo). Anderson begins with the early use of natural ice but hastens on to manufactured ice, mechanical refrigeration, the various applica- tions in the home, on the farm, and in storage and transportation. By 1950, which is his terminal date, the impact was indeed far reaching. As a monumental aid to scholarship the New York Public Library has published an index of titles and contributors for the first 105 vol- umes of the Nation, 1865-1917 (2v., iv+577; iv+539 pp- $25.00). Daniel C. Haskell is the compiler. The first volume is a seriatim listing of unsigned articles, editorials, notes, and reviews with their authors now identified. The second volume is an alphabetical list of contribu- tors, with the signed and unsigned contributions of each listed in their order of appearance. Though in no sense a subject index, this work is valuable, particularly for the light it sheds on who wrote what. In The Diplomats, 1919g-939 (Princeton University Press, 1953- xi + 700 pp. $9.oo), edited by Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert, a score of contributors view various aspects of diplomacy as practiced in the interbella years. Practically all that they have to say relates to the European theater. Under the auspices of the Library of Congress Committee on Ameri- can civilization, Merle Curti was commissioned to undertake a volume on American Scholarship in the Twentieth Century (Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1953- ix + 252 PP. $4-50). An introductory essay on the general problems faced by the profession, and particularly that of academic freedom, is followed by essays on social science, history, literature, the classics, and philosophy. That on history, by W. Stull Holt, is an apt survey of the advance of the historical profession in the age of the mon- ograph, of the textbook as the avenue to reputation, of co Sperative works that disappoint, of the swing to relativism, and of vastly increased attention to American history and to social history, influenced mean- while by the theses of seapower, the frontier, economic interpretation, and urban determinism.</page><page sequence="4">94 PACIFIC HISTORICAL REVIEW Beatrice Reynolds, "Shifting Currents in Historical Criticism," Journal of the History of Ideas, October.

WESTERN LATIN AMERICA A new English version of The Annals of the Cakchiquels (University of Oklahoma Press, 1953. ix + 217 pp. $3-75) has been prepared by Adrian Recinos and Delia Goetz. To round out the volume the text of Title of the Lords of Totoniapdn is also included. Along with the Popul Vuh, these are the principal literary remains of the Maya. The Annals is attributed to two post-conquest Cakquiquels, who drew, how- ever, on tribal lore for part of their account. The other two works are anonymous and come from another Maya group, the Quich6. The</page><page sequence="5">OTHER RECENT PUBLICATIONS 95 Annals sheds some further light on the prehistory of the Maya area, but is most valuable for what it reveals about the interplay of Spanish and Maya culture. Joseph Winfield Fretz, Pilgrims in Paraguay (Herald Press, 1953. xv + 247 pp. $2.75) is a sociological report on the Mennonite refugee colonies established in Paraguay, Uruguay, and Brazil in the course of the past quarter century.

In recent months the Institute of Contemporary Art has had a collec- tion of paintings and drawings by Jose Clemente Orozco on tour to principal cities in the United States, Los Angeles excepted. MacKinley Helm, Man of Fire, J. C.

THE PLAINS AND THE ROCKIES Frank Raymond Secoy, Changing Military Patterns on the Great Plains (J. J. Augustin, 1953. viii + 112 pp. $2.75) is a circumstantial analysis of the immediate consequences of two great cultural acquisi- tions by the Plains Indians in the period from the early seventeenth to early nineteenth century. From the Spaniards on the south came the horse, and from the French and English on the east came the gun. Even- tually the horse frontier and the gun frontier intersected and overspread the entire area. Meanwhile, a whole series of adjustments occurred which have interest to the anthropologist and importance for the his- torian of this region. In 1937 Charles L. Camp performed a notable service by revising and expanding Henry R. Wagner's The Plains and the Rockies: A Bibliog- raphy of Original Narratives of Travel and Adventure, z8oo--865. That edition added some 75 titles to Wagner's 1921 listing. Comes now another expansion, made after another sixteen years, and adding 11 o entries. As might comfortably have been predicted, many of the new titles are of only incidental significance as compared to those earlier recorded. This new edition (Long's College Book Company, 1953. [vii] + 6o0 + [32] pp. $15.00) is not apt to rival the first printing of the first edition in rarity, and it cannot compete with the Grabhorn product of 1937 as an ornament to printing, yet its expanded notations, along with the added entries, move it to the head of the list for reference purposes. As sequel to an earlier volume in which he dealt with the medical history of Texas from 1528 to 1853, Pat Ireland Nixon, M.D., has writ- ten A History of the Texas Medical Association, 1853-1953 (University of Texas Press, 1953. xx + 476 pp. $6.00). In Greener Fields (Thomas Y. Crowell Company, 1953- 274 PP. $3-50) Alice Marriott reminisces informally about her experiences interview- ing Plains and Pueblo Indians. The tone of the book is suggested by the fact that three of the chapters appeared previously in the New Yorker.</page><page sequence="7">OTHER RECENT PUBLICATIONS 97 In its first incarnation, dated Chicago, 1929, J. Evetts Haley, The XIT Ranch of Texas acquired much fame but only very limited circu- lation. The current reprint (University of Oklahoma Press, 1953. xiv + 258 pp. $4.00), making available the narrative of this 3,o50,ooo-acre ranch in the Texas Panhandle, is highly welcome. Alice Marriott, Hell on Horses and Women (University of Oklahoma Press, 1953. viii + 290 pp. $4.50); Fred Gipson, Cowhand: The Story of a Working Cowboy (Harper and Brothers, 1953. vi + 2 16 pp. $2.75); and Ross Santee, Lost Pony Tracks (Charles Scribner's Sons, 1953. 303 PP- $3-95) supplement one another in explicit description of life in the cow country. Marriott's offers prevailingly cheerful anecdotes of the lot of the modern ranch wife; Gipson's an array of down-to-earth incidents drawn from or attached to the experiences of one of Texas' working cowboys; and Santee's with text and drawings reminiscences on his ex- perience in the Apache country of old Arizona. Fabulous Monument Valley in the Navajo country and the people who live there are described intimately and in detail in Richard E.

Accordingly a warm welcome can be counted on for Doris Marion Wright, A Guide to Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo Documentos para la Historia de California, 178o-i875 (University of California Press, 1953. 264 pp. $4.00), the first inventory of the sort to be issued by the Bancroft Library. The listings are alphabetical by author, with date and place and addressee indicated. In most instances the item is identified as letter, bill, receipt, or petition, but almost no other information is vouchsafed. As a guide, therefore, this calendar is exceedingly noncommital. Thus limited, it needed no index and has none. Yet for all its bareness, this calendar is an advisable reference for every researcher in the field of California history within the particular ninety-five year span. As volumes 13 and 16 in his Early California Travels series Glen Dawson has published Sketches in California, 1836, by W. S. W. Rus- chenberger, with introduction by John Haskell Kemble (xix + 25 pp. $5.oo), and Statement of My Captivity among the Californians, by Vassili Petrovitch Tarakanoff, written down by Ivan Shishkin and trans- lated from the Russian by Ivan Petroff, with notes by Arthur Woodward (v + 47 PP- $5.00). Ruschenberger saw Monterey in 1836 when the United States sloop-of-war Peacock dropped in for a week's visit. The account set down in his A Voyage round the World (Philadelphia, 1838) is here excerpted. Tarakanoff's account does full justice to the hardships of sea-otter hunting on the California coast and of his captivity in the approximate status of an Indian neophyte at a mission which Woodward identifies as San Fernando. Out of some 1,500 maps examined, Edward L. Chapin, Jr. included descriptions of some 624 in A Selected Bibliography of Southern Cali- fornia Maps (University of California Press, 1953. x + 124 PP. $3.00). Contemporary usefulness was the criterion rather than historical inter- est. The range is wide; from conventional topographic, transportation, and land use recordings to such as Number 331, which is a guide map for butterfly collecting in Los Angeles County. About 40 per cent of the maps, including many of the most informative, are unpublished. In the noble tradition established by Borica, Farnham, Hastings, Madden, and Nordhoff, John A. Crow, California as a Place to Live (Scribner's Sons, 1953. 246 pp. $3.95) boosts California to the skies.</page><page sequence="10">100 PACIFIC HISTORICAL REVIEW Along with sound analysis of the climate and geography there is prac- tical advice on the prospects for living and making a living. A few minor historical errors obtrude, such as using the reflexive to say that the Cali- fornia Indians used to "eat each other" (p. 14), crediting Cortes with applying the name California (p. 14), and dating Mexico's independence 1823 (p. 21). A more fundamental criticism is that, perhaps because of earlier residence in Texas, New York, and Florida, the author sees no imperfections in California. His theme is that the millions who have flocked to the state cannot be wrong. Cynics may challenge the guaranty that "all rush and tensions disappear as you relax and drink in the mild sweet air," but the Chamber of Commerce can hardly do less than reward the author of this ecstatic and beautifully illustrated book with an honorary degree. With Thos. J. Dimsdale, The Vigilantes of Montana (xii + 268 pp. $2.oo), the University of Oklahoma has launched its newest series, the Western Frontier Library. The format is all that could be desired; the price, equally attractive. The eminent American bibliophile E. De- Golyer supplies a brief introduction on Dimsdale. Then follows Dims- dale's text without necessity of further annotations. It is, of course, a much quoted, much copied, on-the-scene account of the retribution that befell Sheriff Henry Plummer and his band of road agents. It has the distinction of being the first book printed in Montana, and, unlike some such firsts, it has content as well as curiosity value. The Makah Indians (University of Minnesota Press, 1953. xvi + 308 PP. $4-75), by Elizabeth Colson, is a report on the traditions and the present modified culture of an Indian community on the Northwest Coast. It is based on a year's field work at Neah Bay, Washington. The words of homage which Justice William O. Douglas paid to his native state on the occasion of the centennial of its organization as a territory have been converted, with excellent taste and restraint, into a small book' entitled Washington and Manifest Destiny (Library of Congress, 1953- 35 PP. $1.75). In addition to crediting the material progress of his state, Douglas remarks on its cultural legacy, the vigor of its liberalism at the turn of the century, its present concern for power development in the public interest, and its manifest destiny "to help give direction to our new internationalism."</page><page sequence="11">OTHER RECENT PUBLICATIONS 101 Clement W.
