<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 INTRODUCTION Two general points have been emphasised in the last two intro- ductions to Archaeology in Greece. The first is that the volume of archaeological information that comes from Greece in any one year is almost overwhelming. The significance of these new finds is not often immediately clear, either to the excava- tors or to the compilers of Archaeology in Greece. A second, if related, point is that it is not the individual find, however glam- orous or eye-catching, that changes the archaeological and his- torical picture so much as the patterns that become evident in the accumulation of small pieces of evidence over several years, arranged in their chronological and spatial context. Nothing could, for example, be more striking than the pattern of EIA set- tlement coming to light on either side of the sea channel between Euboia and the mainland, at Skala Oropou, Eretria, Lefkandi, Kalapodi and now Mitrou. Last year's introduction was devoted to trends in Cretan and Macedonian archaeology, trends which are equally apparent in this year's report. A clearer picture this year emerges for the Peloponnese, central Greece, Thessaly and Epiros. Greece is still associated in many scholars' eyes particularly with its Classical remains. It may then come as something of a surprise that the regions of W Thessaly, W Macedonia, Epiros and the Mani have become something of a 'new frontier' in Palaeolithic archaeology and palaeoanthropology. Following the pioneering work of Eric Higgs in the 1960s, several projects are now devoted to finding the evidence for the earliest human settle- ment (homo antecessor and homo erectus in the Lower Pal and homo sapiens neanderthalis in theMPal) in Europe in these regions. This interest has in part been stimulated by new finds - in particular the volume of MPal tools that have come to light as a result of the construction of the Egnatia Odos, particularly in Epiros. The accumulation of small details, however, is always punc- tuated by major finds, finds which sometimes confirm and sometimes modify the existing picture. Readers of Archae- ology in Greece will notice that the volume of Mycenaean cemeteries excavated continues to increase, strikingly so in the regions of Eleia, Laconia and W Lokris. These cemeteries are now attracting the attention of physical anthropologists, who will eventually be able to shed light on what kinds of social, political or kinship groups these cemeteries represent. The Mycenaean practice of multiple and successive inhumations in chamber tombs has, in the past, been seen as an indication of a kind of political ethnicity, as a mark of 'belonging' to the Mycenaean koine, a view which recent finds seem (at first sight) to confirm. But the recently excavated and unplundered tholos tomb at Kazanaki near Volos (for which the Ephor of Volos, Dr V. Adrymi-Sismani, has kindly provided a special report) does modify the picture significantly. First, it appears to provide indirect confirmation that the nearby Myc settlement of Dimini may in fact be, if not a 'palace' on the Pylos/Tiryns model, then a seat of power with analogous functions. Second, if the excavator is correct in her interpretation of the marks on the long block above the relieving triangle of the tholos tomb (figs 110 and 111), then Linear B literacy took a markedly dif- ferent form in Thessaly than in Myc centres further to the South. Similar remarks could be made about major Ar poleis out- side of Athens. Excavations in Arta (anc. Ambrakia) seem to confirm that the city's plan took shape sometime around the mid-6th Ct BC. Houses with stone foundations of the central courtyard type, usually taken as being typical of C1 Greece, go back to this period. But courtyard houses are not to be found everywhere in Ar Greece. Even though the Archaic strata from Sparta have been obscured by the magnificent mosaics, villas and bathhouses of LRom times, there are hints that Spartan Ar housing might have been quite different. Though no house or floor levels can be identified clearly, the accumulation of large numbers of painted architectural terracottas and disk akroteria that have been found in recent years is surprising. Disc akrote- ria are usually associated with temples; only temples, and not houses, it is believed, were so elaborately roofed in the 6th Ct BC. But the sum total of these disc akroteria is now quite large, and suggests one of two interpretations. Either there are many more (and more magnificent) Spartan sanctuaries than Pausanias indicates, or these buildings are not from sanctuaries at all. Ar Spartan houses, or perhaps syssitia, were thus much more imposing structures than the (Athenian) myth of 'Spartan austerity' would suggest. Both these cases confirm that it is the accumulation of small examples that often changes the picture. But, as with our Myc examples, outstanding new finds can also have a big effect. Such finds have recently come to light in Thebes, for which the Ephor, Dr V. Aravantinos, has kindly provided a special report. Not only does the new kouros head (fig. 87) confirm Thebes' links with the sanctuary of Apollo on Mt Ptoion, the inscribed LAr kioniskos (fig. 86) provides a new, Theban perspective on the events surrounding the establishment of Kleisthenic demo- cracy in Athens. Roman Greece is another burgeoning field, where archae- ology has shed light on the Roman takeover of Greece, an early (and significant) example of 'Romanisation'. Romanisation could be a brutal process. There were no provinces in the Roman world more fiercely contested than those of Macedonia and Achaia in the 2nd and 1st Cts BC. Recent finds have shed light on two major battles of the 1st Ct BC. Near Orchomenos, one of Sulla's monuments celebrating his victory over Mithridates in 86 BC has recently been unearthed. At Nikopolis, steady progress has been made in the excavation of the vast monument of Octavian Augustus, built to commemo- rate his decisive naval victory at Actium. As a monument, it is surely every bit as important for our understanding of Augustus' peculiarly successful mix of art and propaganda in securing his rule as the great monuments in Rome itself, the theatre of Marcellus and the Ara Pacis (and has the unique distinction in Roman archaeology of being excavated by a pre- historian, the Ephor of Epiros, K. Zachos). But such discoveries are exceptional. What most impresses itself upon the compilers of Archaeology in Greece is the sheer volume of new discoveries. Most of these have been generated by rescue archaeology, particularly through the major building projects of recent years. It would be instructive to compare the 'linear samples' created by the widening of the National Road in S Thessaly with those created during the motorway (and rescue) boom in Britain during the 1960s and 1970s. Such a comparison would usefully complement the kind of detailed statistics on ancient demography and settlement that surface survey has been providing. These projects have not come to an end with the 2004 Olympic Games - far from it. Work on the Egnatia Odos (see above) continues, and soon construction of the Corinth-Patras extension of the fast railway line from Athens will begin. The railway line is almost certain to cut through part of the N cemeteries of Corinth and Sikyon, evi- dence which is of vital importance for our understanding of the massive expansion of the Greek world in the 8th and 7th Cts BC. The volume of finds has also forced other changes on the way Archaeology in Greece is compiled. In the previous two issues, I had tried to do most of the work myself. This however caused delays in meeting the very strict deadlines for the sub- mission of a typescript. This year too we have an unusually</page><page sequence="2">2 JAMES WHITLEY 1 LH IIIB hydria 2 (ice hroi/c horsc 3 Rhodian Geo plastic vase Objects in the National Museum, Athens large amount of information to synthesise. All three volumes of the Deltion (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998]) have appeared, as have the Ergon for 2004 and AEMTH 17 (2003). Greek newspapers continue to take a lively interest, not only in new finds but also in 'heritage management' issues, such as the controversy over the appropriation of land at the site of the temple of Artemis Agrotera in Athens. Greek and foreign archaeologists have continued to provide us with reports, such as those specifically requested from V. Aravantinos and V. Adrymi-Sismani. I have, reluctantly, decided that this information is simply too much for one individual to handle and synthesise. So, while the Prehistoric and Classical remains from Athens to Kerkyra have remained my responsibility, other sections have been written by archaeologists with particular expertise in certain regions and areas. Sophia Germanidou has continued with her contributions on the Byzantine period, and Eleni Hatzaki has again written the section on Crete. Dr Dusanka Urem-Kotsou and Anastasia Dimoula have contributed the section on Macedonia and Thrace, and Drs Irene Nikolakopoulou and Artemis Karnava the section on the Aegean Islands. All have produced excellent summaries. There have however inevitably been problems - not all the illustrations asked for have arrived, and some of the Byzantine contributions were lost in cyberspace (they will appear in the next Archaeology in Greece). This year's Archaeology in Greece would not have appeared at all without these co-authors, whose names appear on the cover. Nor would it have appeared without the constant help and support of staff here at the School. Helen Clark and Vicki Tzavara have always acceded to my requests, however unrea- sonable; Penny Wilson, our Librarian, has supplied the infor- mation on new publications; and Tania Gerousi, as well as translating the Greek contributions, has, in effect, acted as research assistant, arranging the contributions from foreign schools and other sources and arranging the archive of news- paper clippings. Sara Strack has translated the German, and Maria Elena Gorini the Italian and French contributions. Heinrich Hall has helped greatly with last minute editing. Finally I would like to thank again the Greek Archaeological Service, all the Greek Ephoreias, the Archaeological Society of Athens, all the foreign schools in Athens and individual contrib- utors.

Mankou (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 1-9) report on activities at the museum in 1998. In all departments the work of cataloguing and conservation continued. In the Department of Prehistoric Antiquities (E. Papazoglou-Manioudaki) the principal acquisi- tions were Myc finds illegally exported and seized at Monaco air- port. Finds include a LH IIIB hydria (Fig. 1) and parts of a gold necklace. In the Department of Sculpture (N. Kaltsas) acquisi- tions include two Rom heads, a LCI (4th Ct BC) votive relief, and parts of a head of Asklepios, the latter possibly from Tegea. Work in the Department of Egyptian and Asiatic Antiquities (E. Tourna) concentrated on the identification of finds from rescue and other excavations. In the Department of Bronzes (R. Pros- kynitopoulou) acquisitions include seizures from Brindisi (so presumably from Epiros; see AR 49 [2002-2003], 2) such as a LGeo bronze votive horse (Fig. 2), part ofa 9th Ct BC bronze ves- sel and a Rom figurine of a Lars Familiaris. In the Department of Vases and Small Objects (I. Zervoudaki), acquisitions included a rf kothon, a Cl plastic vase with the head of Dionysos and two Rhodian Geo (9th Ct BC) plastic vases (Fig. 3). Contrary to a report in Ta Nea (5/1/2005) referring to an April date, the Thera Frescoes had not re-opened by 10th June 2005. Numismatic Museum. I. Touratsoglou (ADelt,10-17) reports on work during 1998. Apart from conservation, cataloguing and study, acquisitions include purchases, gifts, finds from Ephoreia excavations and from seizures. These last include coins from the hoard seized at Brindisi comprising tetradrachms of Akanthos, Mende and Skione. Epigraphic Museum. Ch. Kritzas (ADelt, 18-19) reports on activities in 1998. With the exception of a Hebrew inscription from Larisa (Fig. 4), no major new acquisitions were made. Work concentrated on the re-assemblage and re-contextualiza- tion of fragments from two important inscriptions, in co-opera- tion with the 1st EPCA. These are: fragments of IG 13 435 (associated with the statue of Athena Promachos from the Acropolis) and IG 13 1 (the decree of the Salaminioi).</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 3 ATHENS ACROPOLIS AREA (1st EPCA; 1St EBA) Acropolis. Kathimerini (14/6/2004; 17/6/2004) and Ta Nea (17/6/2004) report that eight out of the fourteen sculptures from the W pediment of the Parthenon have been cleaned and are ready for display. To Vima (5/12/2004) notes a digital recon- struction of the Parthenon undertaken by the University of Southern California (http://www.debevec.org/Parthenon/ images).

Kathimerini (18/2/2005) and Ta Nea (10/6/2004) report that the restoration and re-construction of the Temple of Athena Nike will be completed in 2006. In the course of fur- ther conservation and restoration of the Propylaia, T. Tanoulas (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 30-36) notes fifteen of the vertical joints (yogxpot) and seven horizontal clamps bore the inscription AOE in Ar letters, which must signify either AOE[NA1 or AOE[NAIQN.The degree to which seismic activity has moved the blocks could also be precisely measured.

S of the Acropolis, Ta Nea (14/9/2004), To Vima (27/7/2004) and Kathimerini (1/9/2004) report on the restoration of 163m of the anc. peripatos, now open, which links the Asklepion with the Cave of Aglauros via the Choregic monument of Thrasyllos, which has now been restored (Ta Nea 4/3/2005). Ta Nea (28/9/2004) also notes plans to re-assemble over 2,500 archi- tectural fragments from the Asklepion, as well as others from the Stoa of Eumenes and the Theatre of Dionysos. Plaka. V. Vasilopoulou (ADelt, 25-30) reports on rescue exca- vations. Finds include Ot walls and a cistern from O. Polygnotou 5, a torso of a statue from O. Erechtheos 16, a rep- resentation of a funerary perideipnon at O. Mnesikleous 13, six- teen Rom architectural members from the Library of Hadrian at O. Areos 3-4, an inscribed Hel stele of the 2nd Ct BC from O. Thrasyboulou 17, and an inscribed (Cl/Hel/Rom?) funerary monument from the junction of O. Tholou 9 and 0. Klepsydras. Of great interest was the discovery of walls and a floor belong- ing to a LRom (4th-5th Ct AD) bathhouse at O. Kyrrestou 15. Amongst the re-used disiecta membra were earlier sculpture and several inscriptions. These include one inscribed LCl funerary lekythos of the 4th Ct BC, another (Cl/Hel?) funerary 4 Athens, Epigraphic Museum: Hebrew inscription from Larisa 5 Athens, Plaka: Rom copy of Hermes Propylaios by Alkamenes stele inscribed with the name and demotic O KYAA[OHNAIEY1, and another (undated) inscription of which seven lines survive: D / IZOYN[EY1 / OX]MEIAH[ZIOZ / --EMEIAHEI[Ol / -- ZZOHTIOX AI[ONYXIO / -rlA]INEEYE / -AI[ONYEIO1. The major find however was the discovery of a Rom copy/version of the C1 Hermes Propylaios of Alkamenes (Fig. 5). Library of Hadrian. I. Knithakis and I.

Sprestieri-Choremi (ADelt, 42-50) notes progress towards the 'unification of archaeological sites' between the Library of Hadrian and the Roman Agora. A new book on this unification is now published: A. Htixayce pyiou-Bvera'd, O A6flvaixc6; t cpinatog I ca to t~ooptic6 torio oAv AOivcv (Ed. Kapon, Athens, 2004). Anc. Agora. Professor John Camp (ASCSA) reports on work undertaken in 2004: 'All the work this year was concentrated in the NW comer of the agora, N of the Panathenaic Way. The material is pre- sented in stratigraphic order, from latest to earliest. In section BH we continued to expose the Byz remains, which lie behind the Painted Stoa. As usual, these consisted of rubble walls of field stone set in mud. Assorted walls were exposed, representing several buildings and phases, though the area is too small to have allowed us to recover the full plan of any one building. The unglazed, very coarse pottery indicates that the main period of habitation is similar to that found to the W, that is, around 1000 AD and slightly later. A single pithos was found, containing a fair amount of fragmentary pottery and several coins. The fact that it was the only one found, however, perhaps suggests that the character of the remains in this area is somewhat different from that found further W. That area, with</page><page sequence="4">4 JAMES WHITLEY 6 Athens, agora: terracotta figurines its numerous pithoi in almost every room, has a distinctive domestic feel to it, with provision for considerable storage, whereas the BH remains, with signs of extensive burning, chunks of slag and a crudely fashioned water channel, seem more industrial. Further work will be needed to determine if this is a real distinction in the use of the two areas or simply an illusion. As regards other traces of the people who may have lived and worked in the area at this time, Anne McCabe has pointed out that many of the funerary inscriptions carved on the columns of the nearby Theseion, converted to a church of St George, date to the 11th Ct AD. In section BZ - North the last of the Byz foundation walls were removed. Very often they follow - and are occasionally built right on top of - the lines of LRom walls. It would appear as though the area, lying outside the line of the post-Herulian fortification wall, was largely abandoned after the attack by the Slavs in 582/583 AD and was left in ruins and neglected in the succeeding two or three Cts. When the area was re-occupied, the builders could apparently see the stumps of earlier walls still exposed and in many cases simply re-used them. That the earlier remains were visible and available for re-use is also suggested by the fact that three LRom wells and at least one pithos in the area were cleaned out and re-used, with new raised well-heads or mouths added to function at the upper, Byz floor levels. Several threshold blocks give the approximate floor levels of the LRom remains, though here, too, the plan of the building is incomplete and its function unclear. A series of as many as four drains was found, each cut through the long W street wall, con- ducting water out of the building and into the street itself or, more probably, into a deep street drain not yet uncovered. The numerous drains, operating independently, perhaps suggest that several of the rooms functioned as independent units, each with direct access to the street. The LRom walls are themselves set into earlier fill, which seemed to be predominantly ERom in date, mostly 1st Ct BC/AD. Finds from this Rom fill included the usual array of terracotta figurines and moulds similar to others found earlier in this area (Fig. 6). Also recovered was a gold pendant in the form of an elongated wishbone, decorated with three six- petalled rosettes and two triangles of gold grains (Fig. 7). The technique, style, and somewhat worn appearance of the piece (petals broken and possibly enamel missing from the rosettes) suggest that the pendant may predate its archaeological context by a couple of Cts. In section BZ - South we continued to work in the N-S street and in the buildings along its W side. In the street, we stripped away assorted layers of the LRom period, many of them dating to the 5th and 6th Cts AD. Among the finds at these levels was a bronze beam from a steelyard or scale (Fig. 8); cleaning revealed a series of incised markings to indicate different weights (cf. G. Weinberg, Corinth Volume XII, The Minor Objects. Princeton [1952], 207-08, nos 1661-66, pl. 98). Along the eastern side of the street the surfaces were not well pre- served, dissolving into a series of almost contiguous pits. These disturbances can probably be accounted for by the extensive re- use and re-building of the LRom street walls along the E side of the street in the Byz period (1lth Ct AD), and/or repairs to a large, deep, LRom drain which is known from earlier excava- tions to the S, and which probably continued N under the E side of the street in this area, though we did not reach it this season. Two terracotta drains leading from the buildings at the W cross the full width of the street to its E side; presumably they will eventually be found to be heading for this large, deep, hypo- thetical drain. The street surfaces were better preserved in the middle and along the W side of the road. Along the W side a 8 Athens, agora: bronze beam from a scale</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 5 9 Athens, agora: gold solidus of Leo I 10 Athens, agora: rf stemless cups 11 Athens, agora: tondo of bf cup round terracotta pipeline for fresh water, broken by several later pits, was traced for much of the length of the excavated street. Further clearing in the buildings W of the street did little to clarify the situation, though the chronology is now better under- stood. Still enigmatic are the two courses of extensive con- glomerate foundations supporting several handsome limestone blocks. An anta block with narrow steps showing heavy footwear, found built into a late wall nearby, may also be associ- ated. It would appear that we have some good Cl architectural blocks re-used on an E Rom foundation, though the function of the structure is unclear. To the S, more of a layer of rubble and debris found last year was cleared and in its midst was recovered a gold solidus of Leo I (AD 457-474) (Fig. 9). This coin, the debris itself, and a hoard of some 431 bronze coins of the same date found less than 10m away should perhaps be associated with an attack on Athens by the Vandals in the 460s-470s (bronze coin hoard: Hesperia 66 [1997], 511-12). In section BE, final clearing of rooms 1 and 2 of the Cl Commercial Building was completed at last. Under the original floor in the NW comer of room 1 two handsome rf stemless cups were recovered in a small deposit of pottery dating to the 5th Ct BC (Fig. 10). We also took advantage of the drying out of the whole area as a result of the continuous pumping of the Eridanos river by the metro in Monastiraki Square. The general lowering of the water table allowed us to excavate more deeply than ever before into the lower levels of the road which passes by the W end of the Painted Stoa. Here, in a trial trench, we encountered several very hard-packed cobbled road surfaces of the Cl period. Beneath them, we hit a layer of densely com- pacted pottery of the 6th Ct BC, with many pieces clearly smashed in situ into tiny fragments. There were fragments of cups and kraters and several bf pieces, including a handsome cup tondo of a man on horseback (Fig. 11). Beneath this layer was another very hard, very worn cobbled road surface, clearly indicating that the road is one of the earliest and more important features of the urban landscape in this area, before it was devel- oped monumentally with the construction of the altar of Aphrodite (ca 500 BC) and the Painted Stoa (ca 470 BC). Why the road is so heavily travelled and what, if anything, it tells us about the elusive early fortification walls of Athens are ques- tions which remain to be answered. With EIA graves to the W of it and BA graves to the E, it may be supposed that the line of</page><page sequence="6">6 JAMES WHITLEY the road is very early, but if so it must have been a simple track as we encountered bedrock immediately beneath the cobbled surface. Further excavations in sections BH and BZ are planned for 2005, as well as the extension of work in section BH with the removal of several mod. houses overlying the area.'

CENTRAL ATHENS (3rd EPCA; 1st EBA) Excavation has revealed much more information about anc. activity outside of the anc. city walls, relating in particular to the SubMyc to Rom cemeteries that cluster around the roads leading out from Athens, the Cl-Rom workshops sometimes built over these cemeteries, evidence of sophisticated Hel-Rom water management (numerous cisterns but no aqueducts) and sections of the anc. city wall itself. Other notable features are the LRom bath complexes, and the large number of SubMyc (as compared to ProtoGeo or Geo) graves. Sites are listed in an arc from E to SW. Mets. Ta Nea (14/1/2005), To Vima (14/1/2005) and Elefthero- typia (13/1/2005) report, with a tone of barely suppressed incredulity, on a plan to construct on O. Ardittou a block of flats over the site of the Cl Temple of Artemis Agrotera (Stuart and Revett's Ionic temple by the Ilissos) and the ECh graves exca- vated by J. Travlos nearby. The land on which the temple is built has never been expropriated by the state (contrary to an earlier report in AR 50 [2003-2004], 5), despite successive (in 1964, 1972, 1993, 1995 and 2003) and unanimous decisions to that effect by the Central Archaeological Council (KAS). Kolonaki/Pankrati. E. Lynkouri-Tolia (ADelt, 61) reports on remains of a 2nd Ct BC Hel peribolos and the remains of two C1 structures at O. Vasileos Georgiou B 9. Syntagma. O. Zachariadou and G. Kavvadias (ADelt, 53-60) report on finds of SubMyc to LRom date (principally graves and workshops) in four locations close to Syntagma Square out- side the anc. city walls. At the beginning of Leophoros Vasilissis Sophias, remains of the Rom 'Valerian wall' and twelve Rom graves (three trench, two tile, six covered, one cist and one enchytrismos) were uncovered. Grave goods include glassware of the 1st-2nd Ct AD. Other Rom walls, floors, cis- terns and drains may be connected to the Hel-Rom workshops found opposite, at the Vouli ton Ellinon (Greek Parliament building). Excavations on all four sides of this building (origi- nally constructed in 1836 as the Palace of King Otho) have revealed finds and structures which date from the LH IIIC/SubMyc to LRom/EByz and later. Apart from LH IIIC and ProtoGeo sherds, the earliest finds are two SubMyc trench graves, one containing an amphoriskos. In all, 141 graves were found, two SubMyc, ten Cl, 40 Hel, 33 Rom and 56 undated. Cl graves include a limestone sarcophagus of the L 5th Ct, and many 4th Ct cremations, including a LCl example in a bronze urn with a kioniskos inscribed EOK2ONO1. Another Hel kioniskos is inscribed MYETA OEOFENOYZ from the deme of Amaxanti. Finds from Hel graves include perfume flasks, strigils and some gold jewellery. Three Hel/ERom complexes seem to be workshops. Of the two earlier LCl/EHel (L 4th-E 3rd Ct BC) complexes, one has finds associated with a fuller's shop or carding, and the second has one room with a pebble mosaic floor showing a deer (Fig. 12). The third ERom (1st-2nd Ct AD) workshop at Palataki appears to have been associated with the production of lamps of the Alpha Globule Type. Two rectangu- lar kilns, also used for the production of tiles, were found near- by. A winter torrent which drains into the Eridanos was replaced in ERom times by a covered drain. In LRom (3rd-5th Ct AD) times the character of the area changed, after the foundation of the 'City of Hadrian'. Large residential and public buildings (including the bathhouses men- tioned in AR 49 [2002-2003], 7) replaced the workshops and tombs. One such structure contained a large number of rooms (one apsidal) grouped around a cistern and seems to have been destroyed by fire in the 4th Ct AD. Finds include pots and bronze figurines, one of a satyr. The construction of a second large LRom structure can be dated by its rooftiles (of the work- shop of Herakleides) to the L 3rd-E 4th Ct AD. This structure seems to have been destroyed by an earthquake. The principal finds are two herms with portrait heads of the comic poet Eupolis (contemporary and rival to Aristophanes) and the philosopher Chrysippos (Fig. 13). The third structure is a LRom bathhouse, probably connected to others found along Leophoros Amalias (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 7; AR 50 [2003- 2004], 5). None of these LRom structures seem to have been in use after the 5th Ct AD. Later finds include one large Byz build- ing, drains and structures associated with the Ot hydraulic sys- tem of 1506 AD and later finds from Otho's palace. Nearby to the S on Leophoros Amalias 24 and 32-34, walls belonging to at least two structures, one certainly of LC1-EHel date, were found together with a well, 21 drains, an anc. road with LC1, Hel and ERom strata and four Ar graves (two crema- tions, two inhumations) mainly robbed. Grave 4 contained an Ar aryballos. Some 50m to the W, at O. Monis Asteriou 3, E. Lynkouri-Tolia reports (ADelt, 75-76) two substantial walls belonging to a large LRom structure. 12 Athens, Syntagma: LCl/EHel pebble mosaic</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 7 To Vima (3/6/2004) reports on plans to unite sites in the Zappeion area with those of the Olympeion, and Kathimerini (3/6/2004) notes that the Arch of Hadrian has now been fully cleaned. NW of Syntagma. At O. Amerikis 3, Th. Kyriakou- Zapheiropoulou (ADelt, 61-64) reports on the excavation of a substantial, mainly LAr-Cl cemetery (500 BC onwards) of 267 graves and one Cl stone drain. Adult grave types include trench, cist, tile, stone (limestone and marble) sarcophagi and cremations, some in urns. Two trench graves had traces of wooden coffins or klinai. Children were interred in clay or marble larnakes. Two such graves (T 194 and 197) contained a wealth of bf and wg lekythoi and clay figurines. Finds from other Cl graves include kantharoi, kylikes and 'Pheidian' cups. The few Hel graves were furnished with clay, and the few ERom graves with glass perfume flasks. The inscribed Cl grave stelae and LCl-Hel kioniskoi could not generally be associated with any grave. After the cemetery fell out of use, a substantial MRom (2nd-3rd Ct AD) structure was built over part of the cemetery. Finds suggest it was a workshop, and there are indi- cations of a (tile?) kiln nearby. Omonia. V. Orphanou, Th. Kyriakou-Zapheiropoulou and T. Kokkoliou (ADelt, 65-71) report on discoveries of a Geo-Hel cemetery along the 'Achamian way' and Hel-Rom workshops in four localities just to the N of the Themistoclean wall, and S of Omonia. Excavations continued at Plateia Kotzia. Discoveries include four anc. (Rom?) cisterns, four wells and four connecting water tunnels, a (Rom?) industrial complex 13 Athens, Syntagma: Rom heads of the comic poet Eupolis (left) and the philosopher Chrysippus (right) 14 Athens, Omonia: Rom workshop with a tile workshop, comprising a room with four circular depressions (Fig. 14), a cistern and four associated rectangular kilns. Finds include roof tiles stamped 1IOAYAEYKQ and KAAOKAIPO. More levels of the anc. road were investigated. A further 155 (107 inhumations, 45 cremations) out of a total of 498 graves were investigated. These were of all types (pyres, cremations in urns, tile, cist, larnakes, enchytrismoi) and of all dates, four Geo, three Ar, 24 LAr, 46 Cl, two Hel, ten Rom and four ECh (with 62 undated). Eleftherotypia (7/9/2004) reports on the full conservation of these remains. At the junction of Eupolidos and Apellou, further investigation of the 'Acharnian Way' revealed two (Cl?) grave stelae, one inscribed AIONY- XIO VIAOEENOY AXAIO. Other disiecta membra of the Cl- Hel cemetery along the road include eleven inscribed kioniskoi, a pilaster, three inscribed stelae, one tomb marker (oros) and part of a perirrhanterion. Other finds include a rectangular (Rom?) kiln, indications of workshop activity, walls of other structures and an anc. well. Nearby at the junction of Streit and Kratinou four CL-Rom levels of an anc. road were cut by walls, a well, a trench grave and several drains, one of which con- tained a re-used (Cl-Hel?) grave stele inscribed KPATHZION. To the W, at O. Sokratous seventeen parts of the Cl Themistoclean wall, the Cl proteichisma of Konon and seven graves of a Rom cemetery (2nd-6th Ct AD) were revealed. Kerameikos-Psyrri area. E.

Tsirigoti- Drakotou and Th. Kyriakou-Zapheiropoulou (ADelt, 76-77) report on investigations around the Sacred Way. Discoveries include a C1 cemetery at OTE Aigaleo of which only one 5th Ct trench grave was excavated; and a Cl funerary peribolos at Plateia Davaki with a stele inscribed IlOAY4ANH HFPOZ- FAATIOY. In the area of the Limni Koumoundourou 220m of the anc.

Katoula (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 84-86) reports on Cl structures, roads and tombs from this anc. deme. Anc. roads were identified both at the junction of Serifou and Thermopylon, along which a Cl structure with four large rooms with finds of bf and black- glazed pottery of the 5th Ct BC was investigated, and at Pigadakia (parallel to O. Spyrou Mela), a road dated by pottery to the 4th Ct BC. At the junction of Spyrou Mela and Athinon, a substantial Cl farmstead similar to the Vari house (Jones et al., BSA 68 [1973], 355-452) comprised a rectangular tower and two rooms linked by a wall. A destruction level containing 4th Ct pottery, 'Laconian' tiles and cws probably from beehives provides a taq for this building. Finds of L 5th-E 4th Ct BC pot- tery from another substantial Cl structure with sixteen rooms at the junction of Valtesiou and Vouliagmenis provide further evi- dence for the short 'life cycle' of many Cl structures in Attica. Two C1 enchytrismoi, one child's clay larnax, one tile grave and one (looted) stone sarcophagus at the junction of Thessalonikis and Igoumenitsis and one tile grave and five damaged crema- tions at the junction of Kazantzaki and Serron provide more evi- dence of the deme's cemetery.

At Demoliaki (Tsamali plot) another LC1 washery (12m by 7.2m) could be dated by pottery to the 4th Ct BC. At Merkati, at a point 100m from a further LCl washery (16m by 8.35m) a 4th Ct BC horos stone was inscribed: HOPO0 / YHEPHEAIO. At Thorikos (Mexa plot), further cleaning work of the cen- tral courtyard of the later phase of the building revealed three onomastic inscriptions on flat stones: KHPIl[EYX], DIAOK [PATHI] and FI[AOKPATHX. In another smaller courtyard near the andron a small well yielded evidence for silver work- ing.

ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF, KYTHERA, ANTIKYTHERA (once 2nd EPCA, now 26th EPCA; 1st EBA) Salamis Kanakia. Y. Lollos (University of Ioannina) reports on the 2004 season of excavation at this Myc complex: 'The most important result was the clearing of an impressive double megaron within the limits of building complex gamma. This complex, one of the two largest on the upper levels of the acropolis, comprising at least twenty rooms and at least 45m long, has yielded ample ceramic evidence for its final abandon- ment at the beginning of the LH IIIC-E phase. The double megaron, oriented E-W, consists of two contiguous elements, each one measuring 14m by 4m and comprising a large hall and a rear room, with an entrance on the E side. Traces of an addi- tional oblong room are also detectable along the N side of the hall of the upper megaron. Communication between the two autonomous elements was achieved only externally through a gently sloping staircase on a N-S axis. The plan of each megaron can be compared to that of the first LH IIIB megaron excavated on the lower terraces of the Cyclopean acropolis at Midea in the Argolid. The floors, and very probably the walls, of the two halls were covered with lime plaster, preserved in places in the N and especially in the S hall. A possible remnant of a permanent hearth, made of earth and covered with lime plaster and gravel, has been recognized in the N hall, while two low semicircular platforms, placed against the W wall in each hall, can possibly be interpreted as offerings tables. The bulk of the material present in the abandonment deposits in the double megaron is apparently associated with the final use of building gamma by new tenants (or squatters?), in the LH IIIC-E period (in J.B. Rutter's phase 1). This short re-occupa- tion phase, marked by the building of barrier walls and already documented in both the E and W parts of the complex, can be closely paralleled in megaron A at Dimini in Thessaly (see V. Adrymi-Sismani in AAA [1999-2001], 87-88). Finds, mostly associated with the abandonment deposits in the double megaron, included: a quantity of common household pottery comprising cooking pots, basins, amphorae, kylikes and deep bowls; dozens of stone implements, among them one of peculiar type; eleven spindle whorls/buttons; a few fragments of small clay figurines; a piece of rock crystal and several small objects. Mention must also be made of a large quantity of crushed murex shells present throughout the fills of the rooms of the two megara, apparently washed down from higher areas with industrial(?) installations. The presence of the twin megaron inside building gamma, in conjunction with the loca- tion, size and layout of this complex may be regarded as addi- tional evidence for the identification of the group of compounds on the Salaminian acropolis as the seat of the local ruling dynasty, well known from anc. tradition. Kanakia, as the plau- sible centre of one of the minor island states traceable in the Epics, is seen to exhibit a different level of production potential and socio-economic organization when compared to the major urban centres on the Gr mainland. The evidence revealed at the site offers important new perspectives on the issue of the man- ifestation and hierarchy of palatial power in Greece in the L13th and E12th Cts BC.' Aigina Aigina town. E. Papastavrou (ADelt, 91-92) notes a robbed Myc chamber tomb at O. Str. Petriti (Ang. Petriti plot).

In another room, a well contained Ar pots of the 7th Ct BC. Kolonna. F. Felten (Austrian Institute/University of Salzburg) reports on the 2004 season: 'The stratigraphic excavations in the S hill area, begun in 2002, were continued. The area lies S of the PH city, which was excavated by G. Welter from 1925 but remains unpublished. The aim of the study is to identify a stratigraphy spanning the entire MBA, which is to be expected in this location. Not only would such a stratigraphy present a possibility to classify the unstratified material excavated by G. Welter, and later by H. Walter, but a MBA stratigraphy is an urgent desideratum in the study of the S Gr BA. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that the structure partially excavated this season, the N part of which had been revealed in earlier excavations ('GroBsteinbau', large stone building), is a building of excep- tional size and importance; its dimensions and location suggest that it might have served as the seat of the local leader. The works in 2004 were concentrated in the squares Q3 and Q6. In particular, the examination of the BA kiln in Q3 was continued. As both the firing chamber and the access area were found to have a succession of floors, an extended period of use has to be assumed for the kiln. The construction date could be determined as the beginning of the LBA (LH I). The construc- tion of the kiln took place after the abandonment of the 'GroBsteinbau'. In the lower strata of Q3, structures and instal- lations preceding the 'GroBsteinbau' were found; these could be distinguished into two consecutive phases. According to the ceramic finds, they date to the transition from the EBA to the MBA, and to the end of the EBA (EH III). It is also to be noted that these structures consisted of curved parts of walls (possibly apsidal houses?), similar to those found in previous years in strata dating to the end of the EBA. Similarly in Q6, the EBA level was reached, also resulting in a continuous stratigraphy from the end of the EBA to the begin- ning of the LBA, identical with the stratigraphy in Q3. A pre- liminary study of the pottery showed that, below a deep stratum of mud-brick with pottery from a late phase of the MBA, there followed a voluminous layer of fill, containing large amounts of characteristic locally produced pottery, in addition to M imports, imitations of M pottery from local workshops and Minoanizing pottery from other production sites, as well as imports from the Cyclades, predominantly from Keos and Melos, and imports of as yet unidentified provenance. The M pottery is dated to MM IIB and MM IIIA. It is remarkable that this stratum contained hardly any matt-painted fine ware made on Aigina itself. Apparently, the technique was used predomi- nantly to decorate large closed vessels, whereas pottery of M type or imitations of M pottery were used for tableware. The number of M type conical cups made from local fabric and the lack of Grey Minyan pottery is surprising. A succession of floors followed under the deep fill stratum, dated to an E phase of the MBA and a L phase of EH III by the ceramic finds. Typical pieces of the MBA comprise Grey Minyan and red- painted ware. The latest pottery from EH III or the transitional phase from EH III to MH comprises previously unknown matt- painted pottery. Important new information is to be expected on this little studied transitional phase. With the EBA strata reached, a continuous stratigraphic sequence of floor horizons and fill strata dating to the MBA was identified for the first time since the beginning of the excavations at Aigina Kolonna. In absolute chronological terms, it spans from 1600 BC (LH I) to about 2000 BC (end of the EBA). Similar stratigraphic sequences are rarely known in the Gr mainland or on the Cyclades. Thus, the finds once again underline the significance of Aigina Kolonna for the central Aegean. Excavations of the structure (the W complex) at the W end of cape Kolonna were continued. The structure had already been partially revealed in excavations before the war. In the recent excavations, important new information could be gath- ered about the function, shape and building phases of the com- plex. Thus, a clear sequence of floors could be identified in the yard of the S building, which is dated to the LAr period by its solid orthostate architecture. An earlier building from the 1st half of the 6th Ct was identified by a floor on a lower level. The floor appears to be connected with pillar architecture. Immediately below, in the E part of the trench, was an occupa- tion layer of the beginning of the LBA (LH I/II), whereas in the W part, separated by a retaining wall, a deep Ar fill was found. In this area, an extended system of terraces has to be reckoned with, possibly constructed in pre-Ar times. On the E terrace, situated to the E of the S building, a large-scale structure was excavated (E building II), which is covered by an extensive Hel occupation layer. The orientation of E building II suggests that it was part of the W complex. Below and S of this structure, which is dated to the Cl period by the pottery found, another building featuring carefully constructed polygonal walls was excavated (E building I). A successor to the later structure, it is covered in its entirety by the floor of the latter and continues beyond the excavated trenches towards the S. The later build- ing will be studied in future seasons with regard to its function, dimensions and chronological position. However, it has already become apparent, through its orientation, that this predecessor is associated with the S building. Furthermore, the E and S building are connected by a street with numerous increases in level dating from the Ar to Hel period. Towards the N, the street ends in a small yard area, partially paved with stones, whereas in the S it meets a larger street with a central channel. Thus, first insights have been gained into the street and access systems within the overall top- ographical situation at the W end of the hill of cape Kolonna. An increasingly detailed picture is arising of the continuous use within the historical period for the entire area of the W com- plex. While in 2003 a stratum of the ProtoGeo to EGeo period was reached in the yard of the central building, this year an occupation phase, associated with stone architecture, of the E to MAr period was attested for the first time in the area, which apparently had been terraced at an E date. The following phase is represented by orthostat constructions of the LAr period, which were repaired and expanded in the Cl period. In this con- text it is noteworthy that substantial building activities dating throughout the Cl period, that is, after the conquest of Aigina by Athens, could be observed for the first time. The Hel period saw a fundamental reorganization, including the abandonment of E building II and the S building, as well as new installations within the central and the N building. These activities are clearly to be associated with the purchase of the island by the rulers of Pergamon and the remodelling of the Kolonna hill into the headquarters of a Pergamene garrison. Furthermore, the exca- vations showed that the entire W complex is of far more extend- ed dimensions and varied structure than previously thought. Also, the arrangement on terraces closely resembles the build- ing complex of the so-called priests' houses on the S slope. Regarding the use of the W complex, the ceramic finds (votive skyphoi and lekythoi, terracottas, kemoi, symposium and cooking wares) convey the impression ofa double function, with both ritual activities (probably a chthonic cult) and ban- quets taking place here. The ProtoGeo/EGeo structures exca- vated in 2003 suggest a continuity in use from the 10th-9th Ct to at least the 2nd Ct BC.</page><page sequence="12">12 JAMES WHITLEY 18 Aigina Kolonna: new access to the site 19 Aigina Kolonna: new room in museum Another activity was the reconstruction of the access on the S slope of the Kolonna hill (Fig. 18). A new path was con- structed as the access to the Kolonna hill, following the exca- vation of Byz structures in the former access area by Ch. Pennas (EBA). Visitors now proceed through the partially well-pre- served remains of Byz houses and the adjoining LAr to Cl occupation, situated on a lower level on the hill slope, with the aid of low ramps and several short flights of stairs. In this way, a much more complete picture of the duration of the use of the Kolonna hill is presented. The display area in the museum at Kolonna was also extended (Fig. 19). During the summer of 2004, the exhibition area in the museum at Kolonna was enlarged considerably. Thanks to the provision of three more rooms (with a total area of about 165m2) with fourteen large cases by the Greek Archaeological Service, it is now possible to display, in partic- ular, the large amounts of PH pottery. The finds are arranged chronologically, according to the stratified deposits published by H. Walter and F. Felten (Alt-A'gina III,1. Die vorgeschicht- liche Stadt [Mainz, 1981]). Finds datable by context from the recent excavation are displayed, older material lacking such contexts complements them, but is clearly indicated as such. The exhibition now presents, in chronological order, a wide spectrum of PH pottery production on Aigina, as well as M, Cyc and other imports and their local imitations. It also documents the most important architectural phases and the sequence of habitation on the Kolonna hill, with the aid of plans and reconstruction drawings, and a number of models (executed by G. Praschak).' Elsewhere on Aigina. E.

Berit Wells (Swedish School) reports on the 2004 season of excavation at the Sanctuary of Poseidon: 'The 2004 excavations concentrated on buildings C and D in the S part of the sanctuary. Both build- ings have been dated to the very end of the 4th Ct BC, when a major refurbishment and enlargement of the sanctuary took place (Fig. 20). This develop- ment seems to coincide with the independence of Kalauria from the neighbouring polis of Troizen in 323 BC. Most finds from the 2004 excavations were, however, from periods before or after the con- struction phase of the buildings. Outside the SW corner of building D a large deposit of broken pottery and food remains from the end of the first half of the 2nd Ct BC was located and partly excavated in 2003. The 2004 excavations showed that this one-time deposition was contained within a triangular enclosure with an entrance from the S. The building yielded no stratigraphy that can be related to the adjacent building D, indicating that the area was cleared to bedrock before the enclosure was built. To the N of the enclosure, finds from the Ar and EC1 periods were found associated with a succession of architectural fea- tures, datable to the 6th and possibly 7th Cts BC. These com- prise an altar, preserved to one course of rough blocks, and a wide E-W oriented wall, which was destroyed when a terrace wall of the second half of the 6th Ct BC was built further towards the S. The abundance of broken miniature vessels in the area, patches of ashy soils, and the fact that a clear majority of the identified pottery in the area are drinking vessels, suggest that sacrifice followed by feasting was always the main activity in this area. Two pits dug into the bedrock, possibly synchronous with the earliest Ar walls in the area, suggest even earlier cultic activity in the same area. The pits had been filled with frag- ments of drinking vessels and large-sized kraters and amphorae, all decorated in the rich LGeo style of the second half of the 8th Ct BC. Such amphorae and kraters are normally found in grave and cult contexts; in the latter they are invariably associated with the prestigious feasting of social elites.</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 13 C Buiding S _4 _ ·f.I .. ,":" r. In the same general area were found two plaster-lined Ar cis- terns. One of them was excavated to a d. of ca 2m (Fig. 21). In the fill, which is tentatively dated to the ERom period, were found thousands of murex shells, abundant Rom glass, and bones from animals such as dog, equids, pig, sheep, fox, birds and snakes. The second cistern remains unexcavated. In the SE part of building D, excavation against the south- ernmost wall of the building produced an entrance to the open courtyard of the building. From the entrance, a flight of stairs and a ramp seem to be leading towards the altar-like structure, found some years ago in this part of building D. The entrance is certainly part of the original 4th Ct BC design. The excavation in building C showed that it was erected across successive Ar terraces, datable to the 6th Ct BC. The investigations in C, now concluded, did not result in any new information as to the function of the building, but showed that the area was a vital part of the sanctuary already during this early period in its history. Also in 2004 a geophysical survey was conducted at the site in co-operation with the Institute for Mediterranean Studies in Rethymnon, Crete. In the area W of the sanctuary in front of the long stoa, interpreted as the bouleuterion, there are several features, perhaps statue bases, and a path or road leading towards building E, the so-called propylon building. In the E, outside building D, several rooms of a large building are easily recognizable. The results of the 2004 excavations in Kalauria should be seen as preliminary, since they are based on field data and a pre- liminary analysis of pottery and architectural features. The study of large categories of both organic and inorganic finds, such as animal and fish bones, seeds, charcoal, molluscs, slag and glass, which were collected both at the excavation and through the water flotation of soil samples, is pending.' Modi. Eleftherotypia (24/4/2004) reports on the discovery of five PH stone anchors and five pithoi of the 12th Ct BC from PH wrecks, recovered from a d. of 55m and 32m respectively near the coast of this small island off the coast of Poros, finds which must relate to the LH IIIC 'refuge settlement' here (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 13).

Koilakou (ADelt, 93) reports on the conservation of a clay basin and of several icons now exhibited at the museum. Noteworthy is the icon depicting the infant Christ being nurtured by the Theotokos (Galaktotrofousa type) of the Italian-Cretan style, dating to the 16th or 17th Ct. Kythera C. Broodbank (UCL/BSA) and E. Kiriatzi (Fitch Laboratory BSA) report on the 2004 study season of the Kythera Island Project (KIP): 'Kythera Island Project research in 2004 comprised a full study season on the pottery collected in the 1998-2001 intensive survey, plus geological fieldwork and apotheke-based analysis. The study season, involving Broodbank, Kiriatzi, Alan Johnston, Clare Pickersgill and Joanita Vroom, completed study of all the tract pottery, with some 9,335 sherds (dating from the Neo to the present) being individually recorded in terms of chronological, functional and technological criteria. Of this total, 1,340 are PH, 1,967 are Ar to Rom, and 5,497 Byz to recent, with only 415 (&lt;5%) sherds proving to be entirely undatable and a further small number remaining of uncertain attribution across two of these broad dating categories. In fact, 5,706 (61%) of the tract sherds can be much more precisely attributed to one of KIP's narrower dating periods, with the majority of the remainder dated within a confined range encom- passing several sequent periods. Of the 5,706 precisely dated sherds, the main temporal concentrations are EBII, Second Palace, Cl, Rom, Venetian and a very large amount of recent (Fig. 22). The KIP tract material provides a uniquely rich data- set for in-depth analysis of diachronic 'ceramic landscapes' and the human and erosional processes that created them; the sub- stantial representation of PH pottery, in particular, must ques- tion some of the recent negative assessments of the overall poor surface survival of such material in Aegean conditions. In addi- tion, progress was made with the pottery from several largely Rom sites, as well as other PH-Cl sites. Kiriatzi and Broodbank were able, by re-studying pottery from the 1960's Kastri exca- vations, to create the first firm cw typology for the First, Second and Third Palace period material. When applied to the survey material, this greatly refined ability to date within the Second Palace period clarified the nature of the Third Palace diagnos- tics, and shed light on the question of settlement continuity between these two periods. The extreme rarity of recognisable First Palace diagnostics was affirmed. The KIP geological research was conducted by Ruth Siddall, in cooperation with Kiriatzi and Nancy Krahtopoulou. The primary aims were to characterize the raw materials used in the ground and chipped stone recovered in the KIP survey, to identify local sources for such material (or affirm an off-island origin), and to clarify the identification of, and variation in, the clays and tempers used in the local pottery.'

Two rooms next to the one excavated in 1997 were cleared, and a rectangular kiln excavated. Isthmia. Professor E. Gebhard (ASCSA/University of Illinois, Chicago) reports on conservation and study towards publication in 2004 of finds from the Sanctuary of Poseidon: 'M. Risser continued work on LAr, Cl and EHel pottery. Some joining sherds link the debris of the Ar Temple that was left in situ with the repositories of temple refuse buried at the edges of the temenos. Significant in this group is a rfhydria (IP 350 and related fragments) with a scene of a striding maenad, swinging a thyrsos in one hand and an animal (hare?) in the other. The surface is heavily burned. Dionysiac iconography among Poseidon's dedications occurs also in a bronze dedica- tion depicting a dancing maenad. Both were found in the Ar Temple. A. Jackson (University of Manchester) continued his study of the Ar-ECI bronze armour and iron weapons. During study it became clear that ostentatious display and ornament counted as much as military practicality. More than 400 frag- ments of helmets dedicated at Isthmia bore pins on the rim that had no practical function but were purely decorative and in fact weakened the rim. The latest identifiable piece of the collection comes from a 'Thracian' or 'Phrygian' type of helmet belonging 22 Ktihcra Nur\cl pottcRr proportions byA date 7CC . -C t I " nnd abble : :,;·: 0] Byzanmtine-Recent SO-,.A .ArchicI-Rotnal " :I Nenfliihic- Rronze- Aver Databli e ndatsbl</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 15 to ca 470 BC or later. It supports the view that at Isthmia Gr dedications of arms and armour taken from other Grs declined after the Persian Wars and ended before the mid-5th Ct BC. Military dedications at Isthmia reach their peak in the second half of the 6th Ct BC. John Hayes continued work on the LHel and Rom pottery from the Palaimonion. The few paterae, perhaps as early as the time of Claudius, uncovered outside the sacrificial pits of the Palaimonion may belong to the earliest cult activity in the Rom period. The vessels and lamps from pits A-C begin ca AD 50 and end in the second quarter of the 3re Ct. The latest vessels in pit C, masses of one-handled mugs accompanied by a large lamp of ca 200 decorated with Cybele and Attis, suggest a change of emphasis in the final rituals. Possible signs of activity in the area of the cave above the theatre in the L4th and E5th Cts AD were noted. In the western chamber of the cave a moulded handle with ram's-head termi- nal belonging to a terracotta patera of Athenian manufacture (4th Ct AD, IP 2281) was found with five lamps of similar date. A slightly later but similar handle (IP 2280) came from the sur- face of the theatre below. Architectural and stratigraphic study of the W precinct of the Palaimonion by E. Gebhard and J. Stevens identified floors and associated deposits belonging to the 2nd Ct (phases III and V), which were related to the existing masonry. A sequence of walls in photographs of the 1956 excavations (B 108) may show that the large, ornamental gate at the N side of the Palaimonion was removed before the remodelling of phase V in ca AD 161-168 and construction of the S stoa. More indicative of the gate's removal is the difference of about Im between the stoa and the Palaimonion floor with no evidence of a stair. Study of the Cl stadium reservoir that was re-used as the adyton of the Rom Palaimon revealed that only the E section, entered through the E manhole, was accessible in the early peri- ods of the sanctuary to ca AD 161-168. Opening of the entire underground reservoir and its connection to a doorway in the second temple (phase V) may be an indication of changes in ritual. In connection with Joe Rife's study of burials at Isthmia, we examined the LRom grave carved from the podium of the sec- ond Temple of Palaimon (phase V). It appeared that the tomb was made after the superstructure and facing of the temple had been removed but before the final destruction of the Palaimonion in the L5th or early 6th Ct AD. The bare surface of the concrete podium probably would have been visible above ground and may have suggested itself as a suitable grave site.' Tim Gregory (University of Ohio/ASCSA) reports on the 2004 study season of excavations at the Roman baths of Isthmia: 'Study concentrated on lamps and the stratigraphic history of the building. Work on the conservation of the monochrome mosaic in room VI of the Rom baths was completed. Cleaning the edge of the S boundary of the excavated area continued. The Rom reservoir, whose NW comer was found in 2003, was completely cleared. This is a long, narrow structure (ca 5.5m by 0.80 m) that is ca 0.80-0.90m deep. It was constructed on the orientation of the Gr bath and its ends were apparently aligned with the SE comer and the main entrance to that build- ing. Understanding of the entrance to the Gr bath was signifi- cantly increased by the discovery of a third base, suggesting that the entrance opened along the S side of the building through a series of apparently open portals. A wall made of local dry stones was built along the sides of the excavated area.' Kenchreai. J.L. Rife (ASCSA/Macalester College) reports on the 2004 season of recording and study of the Koutsongila Rom cemetery along the Koutsongila ridge: 'The cemetery consists of 25 subterranean chamber tombs (hypogaea) and 25 individual graves (cists) cut into the bedrock along the E (seaward) face of the ridge over an area of ca 180m N-S by 60m E-W. Field research this season entailed work on a topographical plan of the site; close inspection of the natural terrain and all traces of construction, burial, and illicit excava- tion on the surface of the ridge; exploration of certain graves and tombs; and the study and conservation of wall painting. Chris Mundigler (University of Victoria) supervised work on a composite topographical plan of the site. Noteworthy among the structural remains are several traces of Byz structures at the S end of the site, probably domiciles; numerous sections of Rom brick masonry and fragments of mosaic similar to the remains of the villa on the N mole; an apsidal structure that might well belong to an ECh basilica; several ashlar blocks of monumental scale concentrated near the S end of the site prob- ably dating to the Ar-Cl period; and wheel-ruts indicating the presence of a carriage road running along the waterfront. These remains attest to the major phases of occupation at the site: pri- marily Rom Imperial through to L Antiquity, with secondary phases in the Ar-Cl and Byz eras. These remains also show that the cemetery was located on the N edge of the dense civic settle- ment, which was centred on the harbour some 100m to the S. In documenting traces of looting, we found that several illic- it operations had occurred since summer 2003, many focused on previously known burials and one opening a previously unknown grave. Our examination of the landscape of the Koutsongila ridge, led by Rick Dunn (University of East Anglia), shed light on the nature and evolution of the cemetery's physical setting. We found that several metres of the coastline had eroded since antiquity, removing large sections from the tombs located clos- est to the Saronic Gulf. We also found that all tombs had been cut into the bedrock in such a way that their roofs correspond- ed with a contact between two distinct calcareous strata, the upper one providing a more stable ceiling for the subterranean chambers. In other words, those building the tombs had a close knowledge of the local geology and exploited its properties for structural benefit. Our exploration of the graves and tombs continued in 2004. The team explored and documented two cist graves (7 and 24) and six chamber tombs (13, 14, 22, 23, 24 and 25). Close study of the tomb interiors, including the architecture, pottery and human remains found in situ, revealed important evidence for understanding Gr funerary rituals during the Rom Empire and ECh period. Corpses were interred in loculi along the base of the walls alone or in pairs, always in an extended and supine position, and sometimes in wooden coffins. Women were rich- ly adorned with jewellery and hairpins. Mourners often left glass or terracotta unguentaria as well as lamps with the corpses, presumably at the time of interment. Large deposits of cw kitchen utensils (plates, cups, pitchers), visible both inside and near the entrances to tombs, show that mourners also par- ticipated in funerary banquets, apparently in large numbers and over a long period. These rituals made use of stone installations inside the tombs, square and columnar stands and benches, that presumably served as altars in the funerary cult. In many respects these remains augment the rather vague picture of Gr funerary practices fumished by contemporary literary sources. We also recorded the presence of numerous graffiti carved by Christians in the walls of early Rom tombs, including crosses, brief invocations and a prayer. It seems that Christians conse- crated pagan burial sites of much earlier date in order to re-use</page><page sequence="16">16 JAMES WHITLEY Excavation Dump 2 . i. .

This secondary use in several tombs led to the accumulation of numerous corpses, generating the appearance of osteothekai. This practice seems to be a common phenomenon throughout the Corinthia, though it is one that has not been well documented. The third major component of research this season was the continuing study of the wall paintings under the direction of Alix Barbet (Ecole normale sup6riere, Paris). In their study of the painting in tomb 4, the most lavishly decorated tomb in the cemetery, they found enough fragments to reconstruct the entire decorative programme, which has now been fully drawn and photographed at a 1:1 scale. The distribution of garlands, faux architecture, birds and other creatures, such a hippocampus, and painted marble revetment followed a symmetrical program in which the N and S facing walls mirrored each other. Moreover, they discovered several new details, such as two incised medal- lions flanking the entrance that might have once contained por- traits, and bands of Egyptian blue framing the loculi, a costly imported mineral pigment that marked the deceased family as both affluent and sophisticated. The content and style of the paintings has several close parallels in L Pompeian painting, though the laxity of execution and pastiche of motifs is typical of provincial artists. On a stylistic basis, the painting can be dated to the first half of the 2nd Ct AD; this corroborates the chronology given by artefactual evidence. The overt connec- tion between the parietal decoration of this tomb and Italian tra- dition is noteworthy, considering the presence of a major Italian style monochrome mosaic in the baths at the nearby Isthmian Sanctuary and the prominence of the colonial aristocracy in Rom Corinth. The French team also conducted a programme of emergency conservation in tomb 4. In addition, Apostolos Sarris (Institute of Mediterranean Studies, FORTH, Rethymnon) conducted geophysical prospec- tion at the cemetery. To summarize his most important discov- ery, electromagnetic survey revealed what appears to a large rectangular building with a peribolos wall measuring roughly 40m on a side (a temple?). This is located at the S end of the site, roughly between the Rom villa on the N mole of the anc. harbour and the S extent of the cemetery. No trace is visible on the surface, but sev- eral massive ashlars in the area, including one monolithic foundation block measuring over 8m in 1., attest to the presence of a very impressive build- ing indeed. If this was a temple, the structure would have dominated the topography of the N side of the harbour.' Eastern Korinthia Survey. Tim Gregory (University of Ohio/ASCSA) and D. Pullen (ASCSA/University of Florida) report on the 2004 study season. A major focus was the rationalization of the project data, and preliminary attempts to iso- late areas of significant artefact densities in the areas previously surveyed. Anc. Corinth. P. Kasimi (ADelt, 136-38) reports on excavations in three locations. At the Yiannou plot, next to the 1997 excavations (AR 49 [2002-2003], 19) a small ERom (1st-2nd Ct AD) bath complex with three semicircular niches was investigated, with associated drains and wells and a possible kiln. A hoard of 60 ERom bronze coins found nearby could not be precisely dated. At the Biniari plot a rectilin- ear LCl house complex covered by tile collapse was built over first by an apsidal LRom structure with associated cisterns and then by a Byz workshop. At the Papada plot, 400m W of the main archaeological site, Cl- Rom stelae, pilasters and drains were revealed. Guy Sanders (ASCSA) reports on the 2004 season of exca- vation in the Panayia field SE of the forum (Fig. 23): 'In 2004 excavation concentrated on pre-Rom strata. The cut of a new early grave, 2004-4 (Fig. 24) was detected imme- diately to the N of the Geo graves excavated in 2002 and 2003. Its NW comer was cut by a still unexcavated well that was per- haps back-filled in the Hel period. Its NE comer and N side were cut by the foundations of Cl and Hel walls. Finally, the grave was almost exactly bisected on an E-W axis by the con- struction and subsequent robbing of the deep foundations of the N wall of the LRom domus room A 11. The outer cut is almost square measuring 2.60m by 2.38m and oriented N-S. It was dug to a d. of 1.5m below the anc. ground. Within the floor of the pit, leaving a horizontal ledge 0.4m to 0.7m around the edges, a smaller rectangular off-axis burial pit was cut measur- ing 1.75m by 1.4m by 0.47m. The burial pit had been almost completely destroyed by the construction and robbing of the Rom wall. No bones were preserved in the burial pit and no grave objects were found in the fill of either the inner or outer cut. An oval niche was cut into the middle of the S face of the outer cut at the level of the ledge. This contained four MGeo I vessels. The discovery of the niche, a feature known in two other Corinthian graves of the period in the same position, led us to re-examine the scarps of grave 2003-12. Despite its massive monolithic sarcophagus, this grave was originally found to have contained a small selection of relatively poor material, includ- ing two hand-made aryballoi, two bronze finger rings, an iron knife and an iron awl or pin, that could not be precisely dated (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 18; and now To Vima [7/10/2004]). The re-examination revealed a niche located in the W wall of the grave cut about 0.75m from the SW comer. The niche con- tained six oinochoai, three aryballoi, two skyphoi, two one- handled cups, a small egg-shaped pyxis and an iron spear point</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 17 0 1 5 10m 7 Panayia Field Geometric Burials GRAVE 2004-3 GRAVE 955N 2004-4 GRAVE / 2003-12' 950N GRAVE 2002-11 . 945N w u CN 24 Corinth, Panayia field: Geo graves (Fig. 25). The pottery dates to EGeo I at a stage perhaps slight- ly earlier than the pottery found in grave 2002-11. This lends weight to the suggestion made in 2003 that the larger and heav- ier sarcophagus, weighing 2.3 tonnes, found in 2003-13 is ear- lier than that in 2002-11. The N-S orientation of the graves suggests that they may have been oriented parallel with a road leading S from the E side of the Lechaion valley. The location of graves this far S is interesting in light of the EGeo and MGeo graves in the area under the Rom forum, and emphasizes the dispersed nature of burials of this general date before burial appears to have con- centrated in the plain to the N of the terraces on which Corinth stands. This pattern seems to be further reinforced by press announcements of the results of excavations in advance of the high-speed railway in the plain. The great size and very early date of the sarcophagi are of interest to those working on ECor architecture. It is now clear that technological advances in extraction, shaping and transportation of heavy limestone blocks took place about 200 years earlier than formerly thought. To the E of the trio of graves were several shallow contexts and a large rectangular pit that contained miniature vessels, pyxides, oinochoai, kotylai and figurines. The material sug- gests that the location of the graves was known and that some kind of activity engaged with the commemoration of ancestors started in the Ar period and continued well into the 6th Ct. It may be that the several fragments of 'hero' reliefs and a frag- ment of a Dioskouroi relief found in and near the Panayia field derived from similar commemorative activity. This respect for the dead apparently did not continue into the Hel period when 25 Corinth, Panayia field: grave niche with MGeo I vessels grave 2002-11 was rifled. Rather than hero cult or tomb cult this low level activity is more evocative of a mnemosynon accorded to the dead and their commemoration. With an exten- sive area of the lower slopes of Acrocorinth dedicated to dining, the possibility that Corinth resembled Sparta in that it consisted of several distinct obai separated by areas of non-domestic use is worth considering further. Hel remains are better preserved than those of the Ar and C1 periods. All the Hel architecture, however, was truncated below floor level by Rom building activity and only the foundations of walls, cellars and cisterns survive. The most substantial remains of the Hel period are those at the E side of the excavat- ed area and under the Rom road. Although the wall foundations do not yet add up to a plan of even a single room, three subter- ranean features are well preserved. The N end of the E wall originally formed the W wall of a trapezoidal 'cellar' that shared a common wall with cistern 2003-02 to its E excavated last year. This new cistern was damaged during the construc- tion of a sewer line in the middle of the Rom road when the road was laid out in the Llst Ct BC. Part of its filling was undis- turbed by the sewer line and contained mould-made 'Megarian' bowls of the mid-2nd Ct BC. The pottery from cistern 2003-02, e.g., the kantharos, (Fig. 26) has now been mended and studied. It proves to belong to ca 200 BC, showing that part of the com- plex was closed off and part continued in use for another 50 years. The Hel pottery from the Panayia field suggests that the published chronology for Corinth in this period has to be reviewed. lb ( c rinthti .

The road has provid- ed us with a long sequence of inflow water pipelines that gives a relative chronology of shapes and sizes over the course of about 0 to AD 300. It also gives us some idea of the lifespan of a pipeline in areas with highly calcareous water. The road had a central sewer of considerable size that continued in use well into the 6th Ct AD.'

Marchand (ASCSA) reports on survey work under- taken at this largely Myc site in 2004: 'The project consisted of four parts: an intensive survey over the core of the site (area 1); an extensive survey of the site perimeter (area 2); a geological survey of both areas; and the identification of significant locations for the geophysical survey planned in November 2004. In area 1 we intensively surveyed 69,000m2, centred on the plateau. Diagnostic material from area 1 was taken to the muse- um, washed, and a detailed reading of the material was com- pleted. Following this reading, up to 10% of the total material was kept for further study. The rest was returned to Dorati. This material is estimated at approximately 4,500 sherds and at least 100 other small artefacts. The extensive survey of area 2 sought to answer two ques- tions: the extent to which the quantity of material culture decreased relative to the core of the site; and if there were dif- ferences in the assemblage of material culture in outlying regions. We concluded that a significant drop-off in material culture was detected in most directions leading away from the core of the site. Geologist Ruth Siddall conducted a geological survey of the site. The aim was to produce a map of the unmodified pre- settlement geology and geomorphology, to assess the local geo- logical and hydrogeological resources in terms of their use as building materials, clays and water supply and to develop an idea of landscape change since the site was abandoned as a settlement. The geology is typical of the Corinthian coastal plain, representing a series of uplifted marine terraces with con- glomerate beds overlying marls and sandstones. Soils were limited to three main types: carbonate-rich soil; iron-oxide rich soil; and a type, called here 'brown soils', which were notably rich in artefacts and are interpreted as being soils associated with the period of settlement. Soil cover on the plateaus is probably less than 2m. Limited horizons within the marls and sandstones may have provided clays that were suitable for pottery production. Detailed chemical analysis would be required to assess this pos- sibility. No active springs were located on the site of Dorati and although a copious spring is situated lkm away at Agia Paraskevi, preliminary conclusions suggest that this spring was not available at this site in the past. A separate aspect of the geological survey examined the chipped and ground stone lithic tools from the archaeological survey. These were predominantly of types associated with domestic use and were made from materials that could feasibly be collected within a 50km radius of Dorati. These include andesites, probably derived from Aegina, and serpentinites, which may come from within the Corinthia and the Argolid as well as from further away. Other materials included sandstone pebbles, perhaps whetstones, and a small amount of chert chipped stone debitage that are available locally. From areas 1 and 2, a total of over 56,000 sherds were processed in the field. This material consists of pottery ranging in date from the Neo through all phases of the BA, with the LH most heavily represented. Within the Myc period, early pottery is rarer, while most of the pottery belongs to characteristic shapes of LH IIIB and LH IIIC, with the deep bowl most wide- ly represented. No Geo, Ar, Cl or Hel pottery was noted. One LRom cooking pot rim was identified, as well as small frag- ments of possibly Rom red wares. A handful of Emod. sherds was collected from across the site, and only one small area at the N end of the site produced a small quantity of pottery and roof tiles dating to periods later than the BA. Not only does the pottery date almost exclusively to the BA, but so do the other artefacts. These include LH III figurines, and steatite and ceramic whorls. At least 10 LMyc cooking pot bases with potters' marks were identified. Abundant murex shells, imported andesite grinding stones, chert cores and flakes, and the rim of a lead vessel lead us to believe that key aspects of Myc economy as we know it were practised on the site. The remarkable quantity and high quality of surface pot- tery is matched only by its remarkable state of preservation, a level more commonly expected of excavated material. In addition to the large walls protruding from the scarp on the SE end of the site and parallel to the slope on the W already noted before the survey, further evidence for construction was noted during the survey in the form of large, ashlar conglomer- ate blocks loose on the surface, possible retaining walls on the lower E slopes, and in the form of a previously unnoticed large wall of rough conglomerate stones and larger blocks below the plateau on the NE end of the site. The bulk of the surface pot- tery here also dates to the BA, but the presence of a small aban- doned sheepfold built above the wall fits with the presence of some Emod. pottery in this region. To the N and E of the large wall, however, are numerous piles of rubble and remnants of rough walls associated with roof tiles with red wash; such tiles are conspicuously absent over the rest of the site. The area at the bottom of the slope on the E side of the site contains discrete piles of rubble, and rubble-filled depressions, some of which are obscured by vegetation requiring water, and different from that found on the rest of the site. This area is also rich in surface pottery, but there is a distinct drop in the per- centage of surface pottery on the slope above, suggesting that this material did not simply drift down from the upper plateau, where surface material is again abundant. That there was activ- ity here in the BA is certain; the location and the nature of the rubble mounds suggest that this is a cemetery.'</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 19 Kleonai. T. Mattern (DAI) reports on the 2004 sea- son. Excavations under the direction of A. Mantis (once 4th, now 37th EPCA), J. Marchand and T. Mattern (DAI) revealed and clarified the construction phases of a sanctuary at the SE end of the so-called lower acropolis. The lower acropolis is an extensive elongated, flat area below the acropolis; the exposed location facilitates an unrestricted view into the sur- rounding landscape, as far as Acrocorinth. Also, the location is widely visible from the surrounding area. 'At the Sanctuary (so-called 'Temple of Athena') (phases I-III) the well-preserved remains of a remark- ably solid stone pavement (Fig. 27), measuring 14.5 x 14m are of importance for the history of the architec- ture. The pavement could be dated to the L6th Ct BC by construction method, masons' marks and the asso- ciated pottery. In the E, an altar probably extended over the entire w. of the area. The remainder of the stone slab pavement does not show any anc. cuttings or masons' marks, and is therefore taken to be a large open area in front of the altar. Contemporaneous with the pavement is the construction of a 12m by 3m stepped base for the erection of votive offerings. The base presents the NW end of the area. Another base (1.5m by at least 6m) is to be found in the SW and probably dates somewhat later. The existence of a large temple in the middle of the sacred precinct, i.e., in front of the pavement, can be dismissed. Thus, the term 'temple of Athena', which has been current in previous scholarship, is redundant. This term dates back to travellers of the 19th Ct and is based on Pausanias (2.15.1), who, however, mentions merely a 'sanctuary' of Athena. The sanctuary was said to con- tain a cult statue by Dipoinos and Skyllis, who were students of Daidalos. To date, the deity venerated here has not been identified, however, a pit with parts of the cult inventory has been found. The pit con- tained, in addition to pottery, numerous miniature vases. Further excavation in the near future may pro- vide information about the cult and the deity con- cerned. Below the LAr long foundations, a levelling stratum was found, containing pottery of the 7th and 6th Cts BC. Consequently, the sanctuary has at least one safely identified EAr phase. A three-aisled basilica with central apse was built over the anc. sanctuary at the turn from the 5th to the 6th Ct AD (phases IV-V). The lateral aisles of the building end, unusually, in conches (Fig. 28). For the construction, the builders used some spolia from buildings in the vicinity. Among the material from the basilica are plaques, decorated with relief of high quality, of an ambo or an altar barrier, which presumably are imports. The basilica was destroyed already in the 6th or 7th Ct, possibly, but not certainly, in connection with the Slavic invasion in 580 AD. Somewhat later, the area was re-organized, and a small chapel was built in the area of the apse, surrounded by at least seven cist tombs with twelve interments. According to the pottery and to finds from the graves, the chapel continued in use into the 14th Ct AD. Kleonai thus apparently continued as a sizeable settlement after the end of antiquity. After a gap, associated with a marked rise of ground level, three buildings were constructed in a U-shape over the area (phase VI). These represent the latest occupation. The build- ings might be agricultural constructions, or simple stables. The chronology is unclear (Emod.?). The anc. sanctuary is situated on an eminence immediately below the acropolis, with the sides sloping off steeply on three 27 Kleonai: pavement in Cl sanctuary o kILb Kleonai2002 - 04 - e aufmdere nAkmpos (S PhsenI is 3 undPhase4 28 Kleonai: plan of Ech basilica built over Cl temple sides. The significance of the structures is therefore not limited to their architecture, but extends to the interrelation of architec- ture and landscape, a phenomenon rarely observed in the LAr period. Numerous large building blocks, re-used in the construction of the basilica, cannot yet be ascribed to any known building. Building elements of the Doric order suggest the existence of a LCl or EHel stoa, whose axial dimensions can be reconstructed as a system with three metopes. Thus, further representative architecture is to be expected in the immediate vicinity of the sacred precinct. The lower acropolis is limited to the N by an oblong foundation (4.2m by 11.6m, cella?) with E-W orienta- tion. The proportions of the foundation indicate a pre-Cl struc- ture, but this has to be verified by cleaning and excavation. To the E of the foundation were found two parallel terracing walls, oriented SE-NW. Here, the natural terrain of the lower acropo- lis ended, and further construction towards the NW was only possible on artificially constructed terraces. The feature was thus termed 'terrace building'. In the course of the excavations of the sacred precinct, a large amount of pottery was recovered. The analysis of these finds will complement the pottery sequence of the NE Peloponnese and facilitate conclusions about regional rela- tions.'</page><page sequence="20">20 JAMES WHITLEY Ni Trt.'d: [,('ic 1 inmp&lt;&gt;riedLAttic m1111ph&lt;ra Anc.

Barakari-Gleni (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 133-34) notes more walls of a Rom villa already known from earlier excavations at the Karayianni plot. M.H. Wiencke (ASCSA) reports on study towards publica- tion of material from J.L. Caskey's excavations during 2004: 'Work by Elizabeth C. Banks on Lerna IV architecture and stratigraphy is virtually complete. Brice Erickson's work on the PostMyc material concentrated on the Ar and C1 pottery from wells, including Cor, Laconian, Argive and Attic figural and plain examples. Most of the fine ware appears to be of Argive manufacture, and this pottery from Lerna provides new insight into poorly understood developments of decoration and shape from the Oriental to LCl periods. In addition, other finds per- tain to the religious life of rural inhabitants. For instance, tri- dent marks scratched on a series of cups and bowls from Lerna point to a cult of Poseidon in the vicinity of the excavation zone. Work on material from Lema VI was carried out by Dr Lindblom and Erika Weinberg. This season's efforts were con- centrated on the pottery from shaft grave II (SG2), the miscel- laneous objects, the faunal remains from SG1 and SG2, and sherds from which neutron activation analysis samples were extracted years ago. Several broad categories of pottery, corresponding to the ini- tial classification by Caskey, were examined. The cooking pot- tery revealed two mineralogically discrete groups as well as a handful of previously undocumented potters' marks. A large number of bi-painted kraters and narrow-necked jars were also drawn and digitally photographed. In all, descriptions, line drawings and photographs of 272 vessels were inserted into the database. David Reese re-examined the miscellaneous objects made from organic material as well as the faunal material from SG1 and SG2. Among 104 Lerna V-VI sherds selected for neutron activa- tion analysis by Carol Zerner, Hans Mommsen and Joseph Maran in the mid 1990s, 30 Aeginetan imports are from SG1 and SG2. K.D. Vitelli (on area DE) and M.H. Wiencke also made con- siderable progress towards final publication.' Argos. Chr. Piteros, A. Banaka-Dimaki, E. Kolia, E. Pappi, E. Sarri and K. Barakari-Gleni (ADelt, 109-28) report on excava- tions in twelve locations in this anc. city. Of particular impor- tance is new information about the city's cemeteries in EIA to LRom times. In all 97 more graves have come to light (one SubMyc, twelve ProtoGeo, twenty Geo, four Ar, ten Cl, sixteen Hel and 36 LRom). Finds from two plots reveal significant links with Attica in the EIA (SubMyc-Geo). At O. Herakleous (Xentaropoulou plot) one SubMyc, seven Geo and twelve Hel graves were exca- vated beneath and around the junction of two anc. roads. The roads were 2.5-4m wide, and had two (Hel) construction phas- es. In the SW comer were the remains of a Hel workshop, near which were C1, Hel and Byz deposits. Of the graves, the SubMyc (gr.10) was a simple trench with an adult skeleton accompanied by an oinochoe and an amphoriskos. All the Geo graves were cists. Both the EGeo graves (3 and 19) were rich- ly furnished with painted and (in the case of gr. 3) local hand- made wares and (in gr.19) bronze pins and finger rings, and both have evidence for a funerary ritual similar to a perideip- non. Both cists contained adult inhumations, and both were marked above by amphorae whose mouths were closed by a skyphos. The EGeo belly-handled amphora from gr. 19 (Fig. 29) was imported from Attica. It is strikingly similar to the amphorae used to contain the ashes of important women from Kerameikos G41 and the 'Grave of a Rich Athenian Lady' from the Areopagus (all discussed fully by N. Kourou, 'An Attic Geo Amphora from Argos: The Legacy of the ProtoGeo Style', in KAAAIXTEYMA'MEteEg Hpog Ttiyrlv rlg OXyag Too~mo- AXeavipaq [Athens, 2001], 51-68). Of the later Geo graves, both graves 13 and 18 contained multiple adult inhumations, fine ware drinking vessels, a lekythos or aryballos and iron weapons (sword, spearhead), and gr.24 was marked by a krater. The twelve Hel graves comprised the usual types (three cist, thre tile, three trench), one cremation in a lead urn, one pithos and one kiln re-used as a grave. Grave goods included perfume flasks, lagynoi and gold earrings in gr.4. Nearby at O. Kophiniotou 27 (Petropoulou/Xambla plot) eleven ProtoGeo- Ar graves were excavated. The six ProtoGeo comprised three</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 21 ncck-hindlcd uica hmp tora adult inhumations (one trench, two cist), one child's inhumation and two 'trench-and-hole' cremations. Goods accompanying the inhumations include local painted and hand-made pottery. Finds in the two cremations include amphorae used as crema- tion urns, a neck-handled amphora in gr. 10 (Fig. 30) and anoth- er imported Attic belly-handled amphora in gr.11. Both also contained SubMyc perfume vessels, a stirrup jar (Fig. 31) in gr. 10 and a lekythos in gr. 11. The two Geo (MGeo) cist graves (1 and 9) both contained multiple adult inhumations and very small fine ware (chiefly drinking) vessels. Gr.9 contained bronze and iron pins and finger rings, and broken vessels around gr.1 I are probably connected to a funerary ritual. Of the four LGeo-Ar burial pithoi, two were badly damaged. Gr.2 contained LGeo drinking vessels and an oinochoe, and Ar gr.7 contained three inhumations. More of the S Cemetery of Argos, on the Lerna Road, has been revealed. At O. Tripoleos an anc. (LHel-LRom) road, 15m long and 4.5m wide, with four construction phases is associat- ed with four damaged Rom graves. Traces of an earlier Hel (2nd Ct BC) road were found, associated with remains of a possible tile workshop and another large wall. Beneath an alluvial layer were found two wells, one filled with LAr pots. Further on were four EIA cist graves, one ProtoGeo (gr.2) (Fig. 32) and three Geo, all containing adult inhumations. Finds include fine ware amphorae and drinking vessels, hand-made wares, iron and bronze pins and finger rings and (from gr.3) gold spirals. Nearby at O. Menandrou (Georgiou-Kasapi plot) a Cl funerary peribolos with five (adult?) cist graves and two children's graves in clay lamakes was investigated. Though 46 vessels, including bolsal skyphoi, kantharoi and stamnoid pyxides and fifteen terracotta figurines came from gr.2, the other graves were sparsely furnished. Nearby at O. Menandrou (Giannou plot) more Hel-Rom graves were excavated. Of the four Hel graves (two cists, one trench) only the cremation in a lead urn had numerous finds of strigils, perfume flasks, pottery and lamps. A LRom funerary structure (7.45m by 4.2m) contained two chambers each containing ten cist graves running along the walls. Grave goods were mainly glass perfume flasks. A further 31 .Ar-or : SLlb l\C 1t ITLIr J . r sixteen LRom graves comprised enchytrismoi in amphorae, tile graves, trenches and one cist. Elsewhere in the city, the picture is less clear. At O. Papaiokonomou (Kotsoyianni plot) a LCl cist grave contained Argive, Attic and Cor pottery of the 4th Ct BC. At O. Voreiou Ipeirou (Bereveskou plot) a section of an anc. (LRom) road was revealed. At O. Kallergi (Vlogiari plot) a large Byz deposit containing tiles and coins covered ProtoGeo-Rom remains, including part of an anc. kiln and EIA-Cl graves. These include three ProtoGeo (cists?), seven Geo (five cists, two pithos buri- als), whose finds include 'Argive mono' hand-made wares, one Ar and four Cl (two cist, one trench and one pithos). At O. Papalexopoulou (Kleiasou plot) four rooms and the central courtyard of a substantial Hel house were investigated. Finds include a black-glazed rhyton with decoration and the incised name of a god or hero and a hoard of 349 bronze coins. Excavation also revealed re-deposited Myc and SubMyc pot- tery and three EIA graves, one trench inhumation without grave goods, and two ProtoGeo cist graves. Finds include bronze pins and fine ware amphorae. At O. Aristophani (Zamparelou-Velini plot) two successive rectilinear structures were revealed. Walls and floors of the later (LHel-MRom, 1st Ct BC - 3rd Ct AD) structure survived. Three walls of the earlier (LC1-EHel, 4th-3rd Ct BC) did not yield a clear plan, but the finds of columns, pilasters, and clay simas and painted anthemia and its proximity 32 Argos: ProtoGeo cist grave</page><page sequence="22">22 JAMES WHITLEY 33 Argos: Geo-Rom female figurines with necklaces to the agora perhaps indicate it was a public building. At O. Archaias Voulis (formerly Messenias-Arkadias) an E-MRom (1st-2nd Ct AD) structure of opus mixtum with an apse was investigated, close to where earlier excavations had revealed a Hel Doric temple. At O. Papanikolaou (Rembelou plot), near to where earlier excavations had revealed numerous Ar finds and graves of Geo to Rom date, a rectangular open-air ('hypaethral'), probably ritual, structure (3m by 3m) was associated with an Ar apothetis containing kraters and skyphoi of the 6th Ct BC. The area was covered with layers of burnt organic material and bird bones, mixed with anthropomorphic figurines, female figures with necklaces (Fig. 33) and terracottas resembling stars. Other walls with finds of Geo-Ar pottery, and two graves of animals (a goat and a cow) may be associated with this probable sanc- tuary. Four LRom-ECh tile burials and one amphora burial, and the remains of a ECh lamp workshop provide a taq for this cult. Agora of Argos. M. Pierart (EFA) reports on work undertaken in the agora: 'At the angle of the hypostyle room and the extension of the porch (AW-AY/70-72 sector) the walls (essentially made of re- used material from houses built in this area after the agora was abandoned at the beginning of the 6th Ct AD) were flush with the ground. This is why they did not weather the floods of the winter of 1998-1999. The collapse of the E and S walls of a square room situated in AX/71 a revealed the foundations of the Hel terrace (B) which overhung the commercial part of the Hel agora. After the cleaning of the whole sector (AW-AY/70-72) we completed the disassembly of these walls, an operation which began in 1999 (cf. BCH 124 [2000], 489-95). These operations allowed us to restart the excavations conducted in the sector recently (cf. BCH 105 [1981], 904) and to understand better the configuration of this crucial sector of the topography of the agora, as well as the nature of successive structures added here. An area reserved for commercial activities was arranged or re-arranged during the 2nd Ct BC in front of the W wing of the porch (cf. BCH 124 [2000], 489-95). To counter the significant subsidence (± 1.20m) between the floor level around the hypostyle room (SH) and the area below, a terrace was built, probably at the same time, to the S of SH and at the same level. We found a comer stone and the remains of a gutter (cf. BCH 105 [1981], 904). Since the Cl period, access was through a passage bordering the S wall of SH. There may also be evi- dence of a Cl or Hel staircase. The west extension of the large porch (PR) was disassem- bled and covered at the time of the construction of the extension of the porch, at the end of the 2nd or at the beginning of the 3rd Ct AD. After that period, the terrace was extended toward the E, reaching to the W wall of the Rom construction, which sup- ported it. The Rom extension of the large porch gave access to bou- tiques or shops. The water necessary for their operation was provided in part by a secondary water tower whose remains, brought to the light in 1972 (cf. BCH 97 [1973], 482, fig. 12), are still visible. It was supplied by a pipe which crossed the S part of the hypostyle room. The porch was probably accessed from the W through a staircase of which there are no remains. The rear and the side wall of the porch (PR) were destroyed during the 4th Ct, probably at the time of the installation of the aqueduct (AR) which bordered the S wall of the hypostyle room and which used the stylobate of the big porch. A system of walls of large pebbles and small blocks constructed inside the extension of the porch, 4m from its W extremity must be asso- ciated with AR. The remains of the destroyed walls were then buried in a thick fill. At a later date, houses in the area were built directly on that fill. The sector has been partially closed in order to protect the freestanding structures and the foundations of the hypostyle room. The foundations of building M cut a gutter of poros blocks. The gutter, parallel to the racetrack from the the E imperial peri- od, was a little N of the racetrack and may have served as a bor- der in an earlier phase of the dromos. A trench of 4m by 4m in AW.AX 87, dug in 2000 (cf. BCH 125 [2001], 565), revealed remains of a further gutter in poros blocks. Remains of this had already been marked to the W of building D, as well as near the E sewers. The cleaning of this sector of building D permitted us to trace the gutter under the S wall of the Rom building. The sounding was extended in AW 86, clearing the gutter on a 1. of 7 m. The sector has been closed. Other work included the architectural study of the large porch, the completion of the topographic catalogue of blocks on the site and the collation of a detailed catalogue of photos. Argos, the Aspis. Anna Ph. Touchais and G. Touchais (EFA) report on limited excavation of the Aspis undertaken in 2004, as part of a programme of consolidation and restoration: 'In the SE sector, consolidation of the N and W partitions of square BD 41 was completed.

We completed the registration of all fragments of matt-painted open vases totalling ca 400. N. Sigalas completed the drawings of matt-painted ceramics from the SE and N sectors. Thus, we practically covered the whole typology of the vases of this category (PM) which will be included in the final publication. Furthermore, this year the ceramic study focused more specif- ically on two groups. Firstly, the cws constitute about a quarter of the collected ceramic material (constant proportion in the three levels of MH settlement) and is sub-divided in two tech- nological classes. The first one and more numerous of these is presumed local while the other presents all characteristics of the Aeginetan production. Secondly, the matt-painted ceramics originate from Aegina (gold mica inclusions?). Their frequen- cy is distinctly higher during the first phase of occupation (MH I-II). We suppose that this pottery, whose repertoire is relative- ly restricted, corresponds to a specialized use and that its grad- ual diminution must be interpreted in socio-economic terms.</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 23 Within the context of the research programme on MH Argolis, which aims to conduct a study of the socio-politic evo- lution of Argolis during the MH period, and which is directed by S. Voutsaki (National Centre of Research of the Netherlands/University of Groningen), we re-examined finds from the tombs of the Aspis. More precisely, E. Milkas worked in the Museum of Argos, gathering all data about the tombs excavated on the Aspis (architecture, location and dating of the tombs, position and treatment of the deceased, funeral habits). S. Triantaphyllou and E. Milkas took four bone, five tooth and ten isotope samples from the skeletons of the Aspis graves for the purpose of analysis by A. Nieboer (bones), S.

Pariente (EFA) reports on fur- ther excavation at the plot in 2004: 'Whilst directed toward the purpose of clearing and enhanc- ing the structures of the anc. agora, the excavation allowed us to unearth, in the N part of the plot, and detect the continuation of the long krepis in limestone which crosses the nearby Karmoyannis plot. This monumental krepis has yet to be dated precisely (roughly LCl/EHel); it is joined with poros founda- tions identified as those of a colonnade (of which no further fea- tures survive). It constitutes a major structural element of the site. The second remarkable monument in the N sector of the site, and contemporary with the krepis, is the great orchestra. It cen- tres on a basis re-suing the blocks of an altar with low triglyphs, from the M5th Ct BC. The N part of this basis, at the junction with the krepis, has been subjected, probably in the ECh era, to various rearrangements, which were in turn disturbed by sever- al small graves of the same period. There was an enormous fill (including fragments of tiles and baked bricks, an abundance of cw pottery and a considerable quantity of animal bones, pre- dominantly sheep, cattle and pig) which was set down on anoth- er fill composed of pebbles and destroyed fragments of archi- tectural elements datable to the L Empire (unfluted or fluted columns, Corinthian capitals, moulded bases etc). Two re-used blocks of limestone, belonging to a honorary basis, similar to those constituting its western face, have partially been unearthed inside the central basis. They form, with their pred- ecessors, the E limit of a structure inpi. At the point of its junction with this central basis, the krepis has also been altered: the poros blocks of the colonnade were replaced by smaller blocks, the arrangement of which has not yet been fully studied. A surface horizon (a street level) repre- sents 6th Ct AD activity. In the area N of the poros foundation blocks, we identified a compact strip of worked limestone chip- pings mixed together with poros, which had been already noted further W on the Karmoyannis plot and could indicate a destruction phase of the building to which the krepis belonged. The route of the present day O. Theatrou at the borders of this plot hinders further study of the sector. The trenches opened in the N half of the Nannopoulos plot revealed several phases of LByz and/or Ot occupation: gravel and rubble floors, the supporting level of a street (oriented ENE-WSW), low walls of pebbles and small blocks without mortar. A brown, fine and homogeneous earth layer, almost Im thick, was cut by two funerary pits, associated with the vast 34 Argos: child skeleton necropolis (of indeterminate chronology) which is clearly pres- ent on the Karmoyannis plot and, to a lesser degree, across most of the agora. The five skeletons found this year, in three pits, were buried, as usual in this necropolis, without any offerings (with the exception of a handful of charred grains of wheat in one case). One of the skeletons was discovered with a bronze belt buckle around its waist. The presence of several iron nails and wooden remains in two tombs, indicates the existence of boards or coffins. The first remarks made by the chief anthro- pologist, allow us to state that the tombs contained the follow- ing bodies: a child, four to six years old, whose decomposition took place in open space (Fig. 34); a teenager buried in a pit covered with a wooden board, whose burial had been cut by that of an aged woman(?), buried directly in earth; a child, five to nine years old, whose burial, in an empty space, was disrupted by the subsequent burial of an infant, one to two years old, buried in earth. The presence of a few rare animal bones in the pit fill remains to be explained. M.F. Billot continued work on the architectural terracottas from this area. Argos, Larisa. Chr.

French (former BSA director) reports on further study of earlier BSA excavations: 'Two distinct types of work were carried out during 2004: checking of details for publications already well advanced and secondary or new studies of material, particularly that of the PostPalatial and historic periods of the site. Dr Rudolph continued his study of the PostMyc pottery. He worked on the overlying material from all years of the Citadel House excavations (1953-1969) and made a detailed study of the material from earlier years kept as samples of the wares present on the site from these later periods. His work consisted of identification followed by computerized description accom- panied by drawing and digital photography. Dr French's work consisted of re-study, often with re-draw- ing, of several of the LH IIIC pots, which she will publish in the Well Built Mycenae series, fascicules 16 and 17, particularly some of the large very elaborately decorated kraters where pre- vious reconstructions of the designs had proved inaccurate or infelicitous. She also undertook a complete re-study of all the preserved materials found in the granary by A.J.B.Wace in 1920 in the light of the additional provenance details available in the original excavation register. Dr Phillips, in addition to drawing for Dr French, continued her study of the Egyptian and Egyptianising material from the British and AS excavations. She checked various details notably on the faience plaques of Amenhotep III. Dr Ekroth carried out the first part of a study of the Geo and Ar pottery found in 1950 during the reconstruction of the dro- mos of the Tomb of Clytemnestra. She catalogued, drew and photographed digitally a large proportion of the material.' To Vima (5/9/2004; 21/9/2004) and Ethnos (13/4/2004) comment on recent steps taken to preserve the site by covering the pathways in concrete (perhaps excessively, see comments by V. Petrakos, Ergon, 23). Ta Nea (22/7/2004) speculates on the results of DNA analysis from the bones from Grave Circle B. Prosymna. E. Sarri (ADelt, 134-36) notes excavation in two locations at Asprochoma. At the Dema field, close to the Rom baths, a well-preserved rectilinear Rom kiln, probably for tiles, was excavated. At the Karyki field a Cl trench grave contained a double inhumation, the earliest interment being dated by imported Cor pottery to the 5th Ct BC. Other finds include an iron strigil. Apogevmantini (23/6/2004; 21/10/2004) notes the excava- tion, by a Greek-Polish team, of a small LPal cave at Kleisoura. Finds include tools and animal bones, and over 70 hearths, dat- ing to between 34,000 and 23,000 BR Limnes. Chr. Piteros (ADelt, 141) notes the handing over of three LRom-ECh (5th-6th Ct AD) vessels, possibly from a tomb. Heraion. Chr. Piteros (ADelt, 140) notes that cleaning of the retaining wall W of the Cl temple has revealed three onomastic inscriptions, two of a certain KAEOMAXOL, the other of EHI[--, this cut in letters of the 5th Ct BC. On the Cl temple itself, another inscription, in Ar letters, reads NI (N-oKorpoctog?). Midea. Anna Louise Schallin (Swedish Institute) reports on the Swedish side of the joint Greek-Swedish excavations during 2004: 'The clearing of the ramp outside the E gate was completed. The NW face of the ramp is now visible down to what we assume is the Myc level. Inside the citadel area close to the E gate the work in trench 11 continued. The purpose of excavation was to gain a clearer picture of how the access to the inner passageway of the E gate appeared and functioned at the time of its construction. Already in 2003 the remains of a stone packing of uncertain function were recorded. The flat surface of most of these stones, as well as the fact that they are tightly packed, suggests that they once formed a paved surface. This interpretation was confirmed. Similar stones were found in front of the citadel wall. There seems to have been an earlier surface level below this stone- paving. This consists of compact soil with small stones and pebbles. It appears not to have been a surface but rather a fill for the stone paving. This year's excavation has given us a totally new idea of how the inner E gate area appeared during the BA. The area was once entirely or partly covered by stone paving. In an ear- lier phase there may either have been a filling or a scrappier sur- face layer consisting of small stones and pebbles. A diagonal retaining wall in the S demarcated the steep slope. It could be seen as the S boundary for the stone paving. In the N, at least the earliest phase of the surface extended towards the inner citadel wall. It is possible that this part was also paved but falling stones from the citadel wall had destroyed the surface. Preliminary observations of the sherds discovered in connection with the stone paving and the retaining wall indicate that it was constructed in LH IIIB2. However, some LRom sherds are either intrusive or suggest that this surface was used also in PostMyc times. E of the E gate trenches E and F, excavated in the 1980s under the direction of Paul Astr6m, were cleaned of eroded soil and debris, and the baulk between the two old trenches was removed. Surprisingly rich deposits of ceramics and animal bones were collected from the baulk and also from a few unex- cavated pockets within the trenches. The baulk concealed sev- eral surprises, the first one being a substantial cross wall built of large boulders (Fig. 35). Between the cross wall and the citadel wall is an opening ca 1.50m wide. The face of the end of the cross wall is neatly built, but the opening contained sev- eral loose boulders whose original position could not be deter- mined, which were removed. Work was resumed in trench 9, partly excavated in 2002. The area is of particular interest since it is not known how the part comprised of a row of buildings attached to the citadel wall was organized. During earlier work, the N part of the trench had been investigated; now the S part was taken down to the same level. The whole trench contained small stones; those 35 Midea: cross wall east of east gate</page><page sequence="25">37 Midca: Mlc fl tgurines 36 Midea: Mye pictorial pottery fragment clearly identified as rubble were removed. Some fragmentary figurines were found scattered about the trench, as were many pieces of coarse pottery. Bedrock penetrates the western part and only in the NE comer is a small area more or less free from stones. Here, the soil is dark grey and scorched. Much pottery was concentrated in this burnt area, including several large frag- ments of Myc kylikes. A Myc pictorial pottery fragment also came from this context (Fig. 36). Small carbonized seeds were plentiful and ca 20 figs were encountered, but most of them were too fragile to be removed complete. The baulk between trenches 3 and 9 was taken down. Fragments of pithoi and large vessels were common and one worked bone artefact was found. It is a flat pin with the design of a pointed body and head, perhaps used as a writing tool. Below the dark topsoil were numerous small to medium sized stones, so densely packed that it is difficult to determine whether they are rubble or belong to a structure.' K. Demakopoulou reports on the Greek part of the joint excavations at Midea: 'The Greek-Swedish excavations on the Myc acropolis of Midea continued in 2004 under the direction of Katie Demakopoulou with the collaboration of the Director of the Swedish Institute Ann-Louise Schallin and of Nicoletta Divari- Valakou. The Greek excavations were conducted on the SW slope and outside the W gate of the lower acropolis, and on the NW ter- race of the upper acropolis. The investigation of the Cyclopean ramp outside the E gate, identified in previous seasons, contin- ued as a joint effort by the Greek and Swedish teams and was concluded. Apart from the excavations, the major project planned by the Greek Ministry of Culture, for the thorough cleaning and arrangement of the whole area of the acropolis, which started in 2003, continued. The continuation of the excavation of the ramp leading to the E gate, by both the Greek and Swedish teams, uncovered the foundation of the ramp consisting of boulders and a stone pack- ing filling out the spaces between the bedrock outcroppings and creating a level ground. This level was covered by a packing of smaller stones mixed with a layer of pebbles and soil constitut- ing a pavement, which could have reached a proper height to make the threshold of the gate accessible. This upper stone packing may have covered a large area in front of the gate but much of this has been eroded. The line of the ramp is now clear and extends from the boulders joining the face of the fortifica- tion wall, gently curving in a NE direction. The huge face of the ramp is preserved at a h. of 2-3m and its 1. is about 12m. At a lower level along the line of the ramp is a stone pavement, forming a substructure. The accumulated deposits which cov- ered the ramp and the stone substructure contained Myc pottery mixed with Rom and LRom sherds and terracotta roof tiles. A Rom coin of the 1st Ct AD was also found. The pottery, how- ever, recovered from the fill among the boulders and the stones of the ramp, was pure Myc of LH II-IIIB date. The presence of Group A deep bowls show that the construction of the ramp is dated to the LH IIIB period, as is the fortification wall. On an extensive plateau on the SW slope excavation contin- ued in the SW of a complex of buildings uncovered in previous campaigns. Under a thick layer of soil the floors of rooms VII and VIII were uncovered. The floor deposit contained distort- ed mud-bricks and pottery of LH IIIB2 date, which includes some fragmentary vases, such as a globular stirrup jar, a jug with linear decoration and two plain carinated kylikes. Fragments of pithoi and of other storage and cooking vessels were also found. Other finds include an arrowhead and flakes of obsidian, pieces of mother-of-pearl, ochre and carbonized figs. Excavation continued in room XI, next to rooms VII and VIII, and was extended in a new room, room XIV, adjacent to room XI. Both rooms are nearly square and rather spacious, but most of their walls are rather ruined. In the W comer of room XI there is a niche with a triangular built bench in front of it. The floor deposit consisted of many large and small stones with pebbles and hard soil. The floor was completely destroyed by the fallen stones. Abundant LH IIIB2 pottery was found in the floor deposit. Common shapes are deep bowls of Group A and B, rosette bowls and stemmed bowls, mugs, kraters, dippers, jugs, stirrup jars and many fragments of transport stirrup jars. One of them has an incised potter's mark on top of one of its handles. Worthy of mention are some sherds from jugs with pictorial decoration showing elegant birds. The plain pottery includes kylikes, angular bowls and dippers; there are also many fragments of storage and cooking vessels. A significant find from room XI is a group of clay fragmentary human figurines of Psi type (Fig. 37) and two fragments of animal fig- urines. They might have been associated with the bench because some of them were found on it and some fallen in front of it. This find suggests that room XI is likely to have been a household shrine. Other finds include many fresco fragments,</page><page sequence="26">26 JAMES WHITLEY 38 Midea: LH III A2 stirrup jar which indicate that the walls of the room must have been cov- ered with painted plaster. Glass beads, steatite spindle-whorls, stone tools, including a large millstone, and carbonized figs were also recovered. Room XIV had likewise a thick floor deposit containing a considerable amount of LH IIIB2 pottery, with all shapes typi- cal of this period. Worthy of mention is a large fragment of a collar-necked jar with well-preserved decoration. Abundant cw pottery was also recovered including a large part of a bathtub decorated with fingerprints on the handle. Excavation was extended to the SE of rooms VII, VIII, XI and XIV. The accu- mulated deposits in this area contained pottery of LH IIIB2 including a rosette bowl. Of the other finds a whetstone must be mentioned, as well as some more figurines of Psi type and a miniature lead knife, possibly votive. On the upper SW terraces a new trench was opened below a mod. rubble wall which divides the upper from the lower acropolis. Bedrock was uncovered in the entire area of the trench under a thick accumulated deposit. Below the mod. wall, part of an earlier wall built of large stones was found, that might belong to a Myc retaining wall between the upper and the lower acropolis. The accumulated deposit of this trench contained Myc pottery of LH II-IIIB date, mixed with EH and MH sherds. An almost intact vase (Fig. 38) was found in front of the Myc retaining wall. It is a squat stirrup jar dated to LH IIIA2 and decorated with voluted flowers on the shoulder. On the NW terrace of the upper acropolis another trench was opened with the aim of investigating this area, where thick deposits have been preserved in contrast to the rocky and com- pletely eroded summit of the hill. Bedrock outcroppings and piles of stones were uncovered, as well as part of a strong wall, which most probably was a terrace wall. Under piles of stones large fragments of two pithoid jars with painted linear decora- tion were found. They may date to EH III or MH I. One of them has been partly restored and also has a plastic decoration of rings on both sides of the shoulder. A few small bones recov- ered among the fragments indicate that the jars might have been used for burials. In addition to the jars, some MH pottery was also found including fragments of minyan, matt-painted and cw vessels. From all deposits of the trench, abundant Neo and EH frag- mentary pottery was also recovered. Some sherds from vases with polychrome decoration of LNeo were found, as well as from burnished bowls of LNeo or Final Neo. A fragmentary clay anthropomorphic figurine might belong to the LNeo or Final Neo. A large quantity of the pottery found belongs to the EH period with many sherds of the typical ceramic categories ofEH II, such as dark-painted or Urfirnis sauceboats and bowls. To the same phase are assigned a fragmentary plain spoon and a rim from a clay hearth with impressed zig-zag decoration. An intact marble spool is dated also to EH II. To the next EH III phase belong some pithos fragments with plastic decoration and sherds of fine vases with painted linear decoration. These finds from the upper acropolis, which can be paral- leled to those from other major Argive sites, such as Tiryns and Lerna, show that Midea was inhabited from LNeo and Final Neo and became a substantial settlement in the following EH and MH periods. Outside the W gate of the acropolis thick accumulated deposits were removed for the cleaning of the area SW of the bastion, which protected the gate, and of the small ramp, which led to the gateway. The W face of the ramp was uncovered, supported by a low retaining wall with an opening forming a drain. Both ramp and bastion were founded directly on bedrock, which had been roughly cut to form foundation trenches for their construction. The bastion followed the steep incline of the rocky area. The pottery recovered from the drain and the accumulated deposits that covered the rocky area and the face of the ramp ranges from LH II-IIIB date and was mixed with MH, Rom and Byz sherds. The LH IIIB sherds, including a sherd from a Group B deep bowl, date the construction of the bastion and the ramp to the 13th Ct BC, as for the fortification wall and the E gate.' Dendra (below Midea). Eleftherotypia (14/9/2004) and To Vima (14/9/2004) note the burial of a Myc yoked pair of horses and a soros containing the bones of three or four others discov- ered during test trenches in the area. The finds are thought to be contemporary with the major phase of use of the Dendra cemetery in Myc times (i.e. circa 1500 BC), and bring the total of horse burials from the cemetery up to nine or ten, the largest anywhere.

Epidauros (town). Chr. Piteros notes excavations (ADelt, 130-33) and chance finds (ADelt, 142-43) in five locations. At O. Ippokratous (Kyriaki plot), two Myc chamber tombs were investigated. Tomb 1 contains LH IIIA-B pottery, including a three-handled jar and alabastron (Fig. 39), as well as later (6th- 5th Ct BC) pottery, indicating either disturbance or cult activity. Tomb 2 contained at least one adult inhumation, LH IIIA pot- tery (including an alabastron and stirrup jar) and a steatite button. At Verdeli plot (Glystra) more walls belonging to a Rom bathhouse were revealed.

Zavvou (ADelt, 149-70) report on rescue excavations in twenty locations within the anc. city. As before, the most spectacular finds are LRom houses and bath complexes, often built directly over Hel houses, but widespread indications of LAr-CI settlement were also found in several places. At the junction of O. Platanista, Thermopylon 177 and Tyndareo (O.T. 7, Dimitropoulou plot) another LRom court- yard house had stone drains and rooms with doors to the court (Fig. 40). Two of these rooms had mosaic floors, one with anti- thetical leaf patterns, the other with Geo decoration and a figure of Aphrodite. Datable Rom finds include bronze coins of Sikyon and Sparta (43-31 BC) and one of Severus II (306-307 AD). The Rom house was built over Hel remains, and re-used Hel material (principally black-glazed cups, krateriskoi etc) were found throughout the excavation. To the E was an anc. road, ca 4m wide, and beneath the house was a Hel cist grave containing a child's inhumation, covered with a re-used inscribed Ar stele. Finds include Hel terracotta figurines.</page><page sequence="28">28 JAMES WHITLEY 40 Sparta: LRom complex with mosaic floor 41 Spatrta: u .lcglatlrn ho\\ I At O. Thermopylon 94 (O.T. 122, Photopoulou plot) the LRom (AR 48 [2001-2002], 34; ADelt B Chron 51 [1996], 116- 18) was found to rest on Hel foundations. Removal of the LRom mosaic floor in room delta revealed a Hel black-and-white peb- ble mosaic floor with depictions of a lion and a maeander cut by Rom drains. Hel remains underlay the Rom mosaic in room B. Hel finds here include Megarian bowls (Fig. 41), bowls with inscriptions in relief from the workshop of Ot[ko08to- and pyramidal loom weights, some inscribed. Other finds include a disk of a Rom lamp and re-deposited rf pots. At O. Agiou Dimitriou (O.T. 141, Dounia plot) two rooms have two phases, an earlier LHel (finds including coins of Sikyon and Sparta of 48-31 BC, pyramidal loom weights and black-glazed pots) and a later Rom phase, associated with a coin of Gallienus. At the junction of O. Kyprou, Vrasidou and Voreiou Ipeirou (O.T. 148, Dimitrakopoulou and Zachariadi plot) an anc. road with two phases covered a pit with Hel pottery and four graves, the best preserved of which (gr.2) was an adult cist with no dat- able finds. The earliest grave was a ProtoGeo trench inhuma- tion with two iron dress pins, the latest a Rom trench with a per- fume flask. At the junction of O. Platanista, Vrasidou and Ananiou (O.T. 4, Koulougeorgiou and Tsiapa plot) three rooms of a LRom structure of opus mixtum were associated with LRom red, black and plain wares. Along the Sparta-Gytheion road (O.T. 267, Petroulia plot) a (peribolos?) wall overlay a LAr-ECI destruction level con- taining tiles, part of a disk acroterion (Fig. 42), a bf lekythos, a lip of a krater, a 'grotesque' terracotta figurine and a fragment of a relief amphora (Fig. 43) decorated with figures of animals and horses. The underlying walls and stone cairns could not be associated with any structure. Elsewhere in the vicinity remains were sparser: walls and coins at O. Kyprou 56 (O.T. 140, Nikolarou plot); EByz walls and a floor at the junction of O. Gortsologou, Herakleidon and Saketta (O.T. 120, Stathopoulou and Argeiti plot); terracottas and a Rom lamp at O. Oraias Elenis (O.T. 111, Georganta plot); and Rom glassware with relief decoration at O. Orthias Artemidos (O.T. 91, Arphani plot) (see also AR 48 [2001-2002], 34; ADelt B Chron 51 [1996], 118-20). More substantial Rom and Hel structures are to be found at O. Alkmanos (O.T. 130, Kanellopoulou plot), where four phas- es from Hel to ECh can be defined. The earliest phase is repre- sented by substantial LHel walls on a rectilinear plan. Associated finds include Megarian bowls, black-glazed pottery, a marble female torso, Spartan bronze coins of 43-31 BC and residual rf and Ar sherds. The second major phase is represent- ed by a substantial MRom bath complex of the 2nd Ct AD, with drains and evidence of a hypocaust. Associated finds include pyramidal loom weights and plain pottery. The third, LRom phase (3rd-4th Ct AD) is represented by a substantial structure with triple apses, if not a bathhouse then an associated building, with a monumental entranceway with bases for two marble columns (Fig. 44). Associated finds include glassware, a lamp and a coin of Alexander Severus. The final phase is represent- ed by eleven ECh/EByz trench inhumations without grave goods. 42 Sparta-Gytheion road: Ar disk akroterion 43 Sparta-Gytheion road: fragment of Ar relief amphora</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 29 44 Sparta: LRom complex At O. Pitanis (O.T. 6, Georgane plot) several rooms and walls belong to two Rom structures. Two rooms to the S, some with traces of fire, probably belong to the Rom bath com- plex from the neighbouring Kotsoni plot. To the N are two rooms of a MRom (2nd-3rd Ct AD) house, one with a mosaic floor with geometric decoration. This house was built on the foundations of an earlier Hel structure. Finds include substan- tial Hel and Rom pottery, pyramidal loom weights, lamps dat- ing from Hel to ECh times, an antefix with a draped female and Spartan bronze coins of 42-31 BC. Excavation at O. Triakosion 83 (O.T. 120, Souchleri plot) (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 29) continued, revealing a destruction horizon containing tiles and a coin of Caracalla covering drains (to the W) and (to the E) house remains with three architectur- al phases, the first Hel, the second LHel-ERom, and the last LRom (3rd-4th Ct AD), this having a room with a mosaic floor and an associated well. Finds include Hel-EByz pottery, some residual Ar sherds and an antefix with a representation of an eagle. Further excavation at neighbouring Parodos Saketta (O.T. 120, Vergadou plot) (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 29) revealed two architectural phases. The later (Rom?) phase comprises two rooms opening on to an open area; the earlier comprises two earlier walls between which was Ar pottery and two Ar plaques, one with a representation of a bearded man. Finds include Ar- LRom pottery, Hel lamps and Rom lamps of N African type, black-glazed wares, glassware, figurines, coins of Hadrian and Numerian and a bronze tintinabullum (Fig. 45). Less substan- tial are the walls and Rom plain wares from O. Konstantinou Palaiologou 101 (O.T. 36, Routsaki plot), the marble columns, capitals, vessels and coins of 976-1035 AD from the Byz well at O. Alkmanos (O.T. 125, Barbayianni plot) and even the mar- ble (Rom?) torso of Herakles from O. Thermopylon 205 (Karvouniari plot). More significant is further evidence at O. Herakleidon 54-60 (O.T. 137) of the substantial Rom bath complex already known from the Kokkonou plot (see ADelt 29 [1973-1974], 283-85). At least six hypocausts of this structure are known, as well as more tegullae mammatae for making hollow walls to transfer the heat and a mosaic floor from the Mitrakou plot. Less sig- nificant are the walls from various phases at O. Triakosion 71- 7 (O.T. 119) and the anc. road with four phases (surfaces) from O. Diinekous 10-14 (O.T. 17). C. Pickersgill (BSA) reports on the final (of seven) study season of Rom (1st Ct BC - 6th Ct AD) pottery from the acropolis excavations of Wilkes and Waywell. Records, drawings and photographs of over 1,400 objects were made, and a macroscopic fabric series completed. Environs of Sparta, Menelaion (anc. Therapne). R. Catling (BSA) reports on the 2004 study season. The catalogue of the Geo, Ar, Cl and Hel pottery (now totalling about 2,250 items) was completed, and additional drawings (more than 180 items) and photographs (about 200 items) made. Further work was also done on the study of the fabric groups rep- resented in this large assemblage, resulting in the identification of diagnostic characteristics which may allow many Laconian products to be identified by visual means. At Magoula, A. Themos (ADelt, 170-72) reports on further excavation of the LRom complex at the Panagakou plot (see ADelt 49 [1994], 183). The structure appears to be a house, equipped with drains and cistern, and with evidence of two earlier phases, one dated to the 1st-2nd Ct AD. Finds include glassware and bronze coins, some of Sikyon (146-132 BC) and one of Marcus Aurelius. W.G. Cavanagh (BSA/University of Nottingham), C. Mee (BSA/University of Liverpool) and J. Renard (EFA/University of Clermont-Ferrand) report on the 2004 study season at Kouphovouno: 'The main objective for this season was to complete the study of areas A, D, E and F. Of the pottery, particular points of interest, taken chronologically, include the complete MNeo vessels found in the deepest contexts in area F (0515-0520), together with patterned, scribble-burnished and monochrome Urfirnis. The few LNeo contexts in these areas have black ware, grey ware and some matt-painted pottery. Area D also has the best Final Neo contexts. The pottery is typically heavy, not particularly well made and inconsistently fired, so that the surface colour is very variable. A0004, the stone-filled pit in area A, contained a large quantity of pottery which appears to be consistently EH IIE and should help to define this period ceramically in Laconia. The fine ware vessels consist of sauce- boats, bowls and jars but it is in the cws that we see local char- acteristics, such as large bowls with plain diagonal cordons. Chipped stone artefacts from areas A, D, E and F were studied 45 Sparta: Rom tintinabullum</page><page sequence="30">30 JAMES WHITLEY by Anna Karabotsoli. One hundred and thirty four were recov- ered: 73% were of obsidian. Armelle Gardeisen had already studied the animal bones from the 2001 excavation season, and this year examined con- texts from areas B, C, E, F and G. So far some 2,784 fragments have been examined of which only about one third (918) could be identified, due to the notable fragmentation of the bones and the deposit of mineral concretions on the surface. In general the main domesticates are represented and wild animals are not common, though boar and deer are attested. The samples from contexts of historical date (areas E and F) were too small for analysis. In the PH periods there are not, at the moment, marked differences from one period to another. Amyklai. E. Zavvou and A. Themos (ADelt, 172-73) report finds in three locations. Continuing excavation at the Konidari plot (see AR 48 [2001-2002], 30; ADelt 51 [1996], 129-31) revealed more probably damaged Cl cist graves with black- glazed pottery and one trench (grave? Apothetis?) containing Ar pottery, tiles, bones and figurines. To the N, Ar walls were cov- ered by an Ar destruction horizon of painted and unpainted tiles and pithoi. This horizon also covered a small apothetis con- taining tiles and complete black-glazed vessels (skyphos, ary- ballos, lekythos). Other finds include a stone grinder (tripter), miniature vessels (mikkyla angeia) and Ar mixed with ProtoGeo sherds. At the Sakellarakou plot near the church of Agia Paraskevi another apothetis belonging to the Sanctuary of Alexandra-Kassandra and Zeus-Agamemnon was excavat- ed. The largely Ar finds include spherical aryballoi, bf cups, clay votive plaques, figurines and miniatures, an inscribed tile, lead wreaths and lead figurines of the 'mistress of animals' type. One sherd was inscribed AFAMEMN[ONI on the lip. At Spilakia final cleaning of Myc chamber tomb 5 revealed a LH IIIC lekythos. Riviotissa Spartis.

Zavvou (ADelt, 182) note a female figurine, Hel pottery and obsidian from here. Geraki (anc. Geronthrai). J. Crouwel and M. Prent (University of Amsterdam/Netherlands Institute) report on the 2004 excavation season: 'Systematic excavations con- tinued in the NW part of the summit of the acropolis. New areas were opened and tests were conducted in areas excavated previously. More was found of the double fortification wall dating to EH II. The eroding mud-brick from its upper structure yielded a very small, finely carved vase of a ser- pentinite, probably an import from pre-palatial Crete (Fig. 46) (Inv. 7039/SF 1). If correctly identified, this would be the earli- est Minoan stone vessel so far found in mainland Greece. Evidence for MH occupation increased significantly. In the area of the earlier, EH II enceinte 46 Geraki: BA serpentinite vessel a shallow pit with the skeleton of a dog was discovered. Unfortunately, the animal had lost its skull when a later MH cist grave was built. This contained a largely intact human skeleton in contracted position. An incomplete bone pin, found near the eroded NW end of the tomb, may have been the sole burial gift. (Three such graves were found somewhere on the acropolis of Geraki during the British trial excavations of 1905. Only one of these contained burial gifts: two small pots and a decorated bronze pin, exhibited in Sparta Museum.) Elsewhere, MH wall remains and fills containing much coarse MH pottery and bone came to light. As to the historical period, much more was revealed of the lay-out of the Hel buildings, their number now standing at five, and two parallel streets, especially in the central and E areas of the excavation. Of particular importance is the discovery, in an open area N of the central area, of a series of drains: the earli- est and largest is probably to be associated with the LAr or ECl fortification wall, a second and perhaps much smaller drain with the later Hel fortification wall. Also of note is a large Hel room in the SE, which contained several cooking installations, both in the paved area in its NE comer which is provided with a drain to one of the streets, and in the larger area to the S, where the remnants of two possible ovens were found. There was also a stone bench and a concentration of loom weights against the S wall.' Peristeri Skalas. Eleftherotypia (23/11/2004) and Kathimerini (23/11/2004) note an unplundered Myc chamber tomb contain- ing ten burials (one child). LH IIIB/C finds include steatite but- tons, pottery and a sealstone. Elaia Molaon. E. Zavvou (ADelt, 174) reports that test exca- vation on the hill just S of Pyrgos Elaias (Dimitrakopoulou plot) revealed a retaining wall and possible house remains associated with Myc kylikes and one animal figurine. EH sherds and sea- shells were mixed with the Myc material. Molaoi. A. Themos and E. Zavvou (ADelt, 182) note a Rom cistern at the health centre and an underground Rom tomb (columbarium) at Loutro. Sykia Molaon. I. Efstathiou (ADelt, 174-76) reports on the excavation of two more tombs from this Myc chamber tomb cemetery (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 33), both indicating use from LH IIIA-LH IIIC early. Tomb 3, though partly looted, still con- tained four trench graves with eight burials (five adults, three children). Sparse finds include faience beads, an LH IIIA gob- let, a bronze knife and several jugs. Tomb 4 was unlooted. In the chamber above the four trenches were the remains of a female inhumation, a trefoil amphoriskos, a trefoil oinochoe, a cylindrical alabastron and a stirrup jar (Fig. 47). The trenches contained the remains of nine adults and three children. Zarax (anc. lerax). A. Themos and E.

Ethnos (23/3/2005) notes geophysical prospection in the heavily alluviated area of the Geo-Cl Sanctuary of Poseidon. Thouria. E. Greco (Italian School) reports on survey during 2004: 'The structures already mentioned by Valmin (Etudes topographiques sur la Messinie ancienne [Lund, 1930]), have been partially located thanks to a preliminary survey which took place in the plain which extends in a N-S direction over the mod. settlements of Antheia and Aipeia. Traces of the Hel city wall were observed. The best-preserved parts (up to six cours- es over the foundation trench) are those on the N spur of the plain, as well as those on its N-W slope, at a slightly lower level. In the N there are traces of a tower. The NW comer contains other protruding structures, perhaps indicating another tower, or a gate. The masonry is perfectly isodomic, with headers in alternating rows, corresponding with the projections (lugs) which bond the wall into the adjacent ter- races. The courses are 65cm high; the courses of blocks, which 47 Sykia lolkaon: 11Vc stirrup jar are laid completely flat, are 130cm in h.; the projections are regularly distributed with a distance of 260cm; the headers measure 48.5cm in size. At the lowest level, on the W slope, the walls are preserved for no more than five courses. In this area, a change of the wall's course is visible; and dog's tooth masonry may suggest a tower. Further to the S, the facing of the walls has collapsed, revealing among much vegetation the remains of two lugs still bonded into the earth of the adjacent terrace. The plain also fea- tures many terrace walls, in no recognisable order. Some of them, in opus quadratum, are of the highest quality. In particu- lar, on the W side of a terrace which is immediately upstream from the mod. path and near the great rock-cut cistem, we found a wall of smoothed isodomic masonry, which could be followed for ca 60m. In the centre of the plain it is also possible to observe a number of structures in situ. In the middle of a ter- race, near a small, apparently in situ, column, we observed a comer formed by orthostath-built foundation walls, which has been named NW comer. Around the cistern and visible imme- diately downstream of the mod. path, on the W slopes of the plain, are structures made of blocks and covered with Rom or Byz structures. A number of them form part of a mod. agricul- tural building. As is often the case, small mod. rural structures are built by re-using, as foundations, more anc. structures. Antheia, Ellinika. G. Chatzi-Spiliopoulou (ADelt, 235-36) notes one more tomb (tomb 13) from this Myc chamber tomb cemetery (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 34) at the plot. The tomb had both a central chamber (with a trench) and a side chamber. No finds are recorded. 0. Vikatou (ADelt, 241) notes two Cl coins from the vicinity. Anc. Messene. P. Themelis (ASA) continued his programme of conservation and survey (Ergon, 24-32) (Fig. 48). In the the- atre area several Hel and Rom houses were investigated, some LRom examples having mosaic floors (Fig. 49). In the agora, 25m of the NE comer of the N Stoa was thor- oughly investigated. At 186m 1., this Hel stoa is 70m longer than the Stoa of Attalos in Athens, but (at 18m) 4m narrower. Its three rows of columns (Doric on the exterior, and two rows of Cor sandstone columns inside) probably supported a first storey, but there is no sign of the 'shops' as on the Stoa of Attalus. Instead there are rectangular niches for statues. To the S, investigation of a Doric temple within the agora uncovered several Hel (3rd Ct BC) inscribed stelae. Further to the S, but still within the agora, investigation of a well revealed numerous bones of dogs and human infants, accompanied by amphorae lacking their upper parts, suggesting these are secondary burials. Significant Hel parallels can be found in the Athenian agora and on Astypalaia. Nearby, a statue base bears 206 lines of a Hel inscription of the 2nd Ct BC containing two arbitrations, the first by Andania on a border dispute between Messene and Megalo- polis, the second concerning itself with the produce from the disputed territory. This last identifies the base as the base of the horses, on which statues of the Diokouroi may have stood. Further investigation of the narthex of the ECh theatre basilica revealed more Fr graves and coins. Finds from anoth- er basilica in the Asklepeion include glassware. In the Sanctuary of the Hero rooms of the 4th Ct BC and later peri- ods were investigated. Kephalovryso. G. Chatzi-Spiliopoulou (ADelt, 233-35) reports on the excavation of a new Myc tholos tomb at Paliomylos. The tomb is small (chamber 3.2m di.), and the dromos short (ca 2m).

Cosmopoulos (ASA) continued his survey of a 4km2 area to the S and W of Ano Englianos (Ergon, 32-34). Among three new Myc sites that can be identified through sur- face pottery, the probable settlement at Myrsinochori can prob- ably be associated with the Myc cemetery at Routsi. Ano Englianos (anc. Pylos, the 'Palace of Nestor'). X. Arapoyianni (ADelt, 242) notes Myc sherds and pithoi from the Kalogeropoulou plot given to the Chora museum. J.L.Davis (University of Cincinnatti) and S. Stocker report on the 2004 season of re-study of material from Blegen's exca- vations at the Palace of Nestor and study of finds from the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project (PRAP): 'Basic examination of the human remains from tombs exca- vated by Blegen was completed in 2003 by L. Schepartz and S. Miller-Antonio. It is now clear that few Pylians lived beyond age 35, and, as result, there is limited evidence of osteoarthritis or other age-related pathologies. Some individuals display dipl6e expansion and marked limb shaft cortical thickening that may have a genetic or stress-response basis. When dental pathology (caries, premortem tooth loss, hypoplasia) is assessed, the grave circle individuals differ from the later buri- als. The overall frequency of dental pathology is greater in later Myc burials. Females have the highest rates of dental decay and tooth loss, potentially linked to gender specific dietary stresses or the depletion of resources during reproduction. A re- examination of the archaeological contexts of human remains has been initiated by J. Murphy. Examination of faunal remains by P. Halstead and V. Isaakidou is nearing completion, as is study of the contexts of these finds by S. Stocker and J. Davis. Study of painted plaster made great progress under the direc- tion of H. Brecoulaki. Every single fragment of the wall paint- ing corpus of the palace is now marked with an inventory num- ber and properly stored in newly built drawers. Systematic dig- ital recording continues. These improvements facilitate conser- vation of fragments and their re-examination both from an art historical and scientific perspective. Faded black lines of the eye and eyebrow of the so-called White Goddess (49a H nws) are now more visible, and it is clear that there were pink high- lights on the nose and cheek of her face; the artist was con- cerned with rendering plastic effects. PIXE-ALPHA measure- ments taken on eleven fragments of Egyptian blue from differ- ent parts of the palace confirm that lighter tones contain less copper. Of great interest is the detection of murex purple on two samples taken from the NW wall of the throne room, sug- gesting that the choice of this colour for the most important room of the palace may have had symbolic and ritual meaning, in addition to aesthetic value. Characterization of the binding materials used in the frescoes from the Palace of Nestor, per- formed by means of GC/MS, HLPC and FTIR, confirmed in the case of almost all samples the use of organic binders, and, there- fore, that a tempera technique had been employed. A new join was found to the so-called 'archer fragment' (AR 50 [2003-2004], 31), confirming that the female figure repre- sented holds a bow, and that the fresco was originally located in room 27. Green fronds and flowers, rendered in a naturalistic rather than a stylized manner, have been recognized in the throne room for the first time. A small human head was docu- mented below the scene of 'Two Men at Table' on fragment 44a H 6. The most significant new discovery consisted of a group on unpublished fragments from hall 64 that depict naval themes, and include ships, oars, and perhaps fish.' 49 Messene: mosaic and LRom houses</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 33 50 Phygaleia: Cl perirrhanterion base Pyrgaki Triphylias.

Then the original but very damaged capital was restored in artificial stone, the rough mould finished in tradi- tional stone masons' technique and added to the column with the aid of a crane. Olympia has received a new landmark, wide- ly visible with its h. of 10.52m (Fig. 53) (see also Eleftherotypia 16/7/2004 ). At the same time, the reconstruction of the Philippeion con- tinued. By the summer, a total of 65 blocks of the krepis had been set into place, on which the column bases and the lower drums of the three columns intended for complete reconstruc- tion, could be erected. Thus, visitors were presented with a first impression of the planned partial reconstruction of this impor- tant building (Fig. 54). Three trial excavations, planned over a long period of time, were conducted in October and November. The aim of the sounding at Treasury IV was to clarify the construction of its foundations and to obtain a stratigraphy of the levelling of the terrace (Fig. 55). Underneath the two visible tiers of large foun- dation blocks, a fill of boulders was found which to the S has a d. exceeding 2m, and which in its lower part cuts through a Geo stratum. Fifteen well-preserved bronze animal figures and a few further bronze small finds were recovered from this undis- 54 Olympia: restored base of Phillippeion 55 Olympia: treasury IV foundations turbed context. No strata which would facilitate a dating of the treasury could be identified. However, additional fragments of well-made, white limestone architectural elements were recov- ered from the fill of the old excavations. These support the identification of the foundations with the Treasury of Epidamnos. Within the Gr baths, an incompletely excavated well was cleared to the bottom. In 1939, the well had not been dug in its entirety due to its poor preservation. While an extended period of use until the LRom Imperial period is documented by a num- ber of finds, including a small gold ring, the date of construc- tion could not be verified through stratigraphy. However, con- struction marks on the terracotta rings (of which originally there were nine) and the shape of the letters on the lead clamps indi- cate a Hel date. Consequently, the well cannot be associated with the baths of the 5th Ct BC, as previously thought.</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 35 The third excavation area is situated W of the Kladeos, where a row of columns, belonging to a previously unknown stoa, had been discovered in 1999 in the vicinity of the Gymnasium. The examinations resulted in indications of intensive use during the E Imperial period, and suggested an orientation of the stoa towards the W. Remains of the back wall, expected towards the E, could not be recovered, due to the nearby deeply cut river embankment. Thus, no further infor- mation could be gained about the nature of the quarters of the athletes, mentioned by Pausanias (VI.21.2), with which the stoa was probably associated.'

Alexopoulou (ADelt, 269-74) report on excavations in six loca- tions. At Palaiomylos (junction of O. Aristainetou and 0. Achaikis Sympoliteias, Piperi plot) two rooms of a LHel-ERom complex, perhaps a workshop, were investigated. Finds include coins of Patras of the 1st Ct BC and of Augustus. At O. Aristotelous (Leivada plot) three kilns belonging to an ERom workshop complex were investigated. The workshop's prod- ucts include tiles (some stamped with Latin characters), terra- cotta architectural pieces and terracotta plaques of the 'Campana' type. The stamp MOSCHI (ON) in Latin characters dates the workshop to the end of the 1st Ct BC. At the School complex three pits (apothetis) and two wells contained some Ar and Cl pottery. At the Dimopoulou field some walls and Hel pottery, at O. Agiou Ioannou 10 parts of a large Hel structure and at the Haralambidi plot more Hel walls were revealed. Tsoukaleika, Anemomylos. M. Petropoulos (ADelt, 268) notes walls and an EHel tile destruction, dated by pottery of 4th-3rd Ct BC and a coin of the Achaean League to around 251 BC. Ano Alissos. A.

Petropoulos (ADelt, 267) notes finds in two locations: at the Papaconstantinou plot a LCl-EHel structure and at Agios Konstantinos a further chamber tomb from this known Myc cemetery were investigated. Though plundered, some burials were still intact. LH IIIC finds include stirrup jars, amphoriskoi and a bronze knife. Environs of Patras. M. Stavropoulou-Gatsi (ADelt, 264-67) reports on finds in two locations. At Vounteni, Ano Sychaina road, two Cl farm complexes were investigated. Complex A had rooms of 8.9m by 6m, and was covered by a collapse layer of both Cor and Laconian tiles. Finds include loom weights, a pithos, stone grinders and sparse Geo and Ar finds (perhaps associated with an apsidal wall to the S). Complex B was also covered by a collapse layer of Cor tiles. Finds include a pithos, LAr, Cl, Hel and ERom pottery and 100 pyramidal loom weights, 40 of which were stamped (Fig. 59). At Riganokampos a rich deposit of Rom pottery and lamps unfortunately had no useful context. Patras. M. Petropoulos, M. Stavropoulou-Gatsi, A. Vasilo- gambrou, E.I. Kolia, G. Alexopoulou and L. Papakosta (ADelt, 249-64) report on investigations of largely Rom but also Hel and Byz remains in 83 locations within the mod. city and Rom colonia. Of these, only around 30 produced significant finds. At O. Aretha 52 further cleaning of the foundations of the Rom bridge produced a metrical Rom inscription honouring 58 Teichos Dymaion: general view 59 Vounteni: stamped pyramidal loomweights one Artemios, responsible for the construction of the older bridge in the 2nd or 3rd Ct AD. At O. Votsari 27 Rom walls of opus reticulatum and opus testaceum, at O. 12ou Syntagmatos 82a LRom/Byz walls, at O. Dionysiou 66, Samakia LHel and Rom pottery and structural remains, at O. Adramyttiou 4 two more rooms of a Rom complex with signs of earlier Hel occu- pation, and at the junction of O. Damiri 27 and Robertou Koch several ECh tile graves were investigated. At the junction of O. Lontou 93 and Karatza a 14.5m stretch of a Rom road, 4.2m wide, and accompanying drains abutted to the W two rooms of a Rom structure with mosaic floors with evidence of two earlier phases. Scantier remains were found to the E. At Zarouchleika (OEK plot) the base of a Rom memorial/funerary structure, 12.7m by 12.2m and 2.5-3.4m high, partly constructed of opus caementicum was built over a destruction layer containing the lids of two sarcophagi, one of Attic marble (Fig. 60). Nearby were two Rom tile graves. At O. III Oreivatikou, Parodos D6 anc. walls and Hel pottery, at O. Vasileos Roufou 92 Hel and Rom walls and at O. Erenstrole 56-62 a more substantial architectural complex with Hel to EByz phases were investigated. Nine rooms belonging to the two Rom phases were identified. Nearby was a small kiln for the production of loom weights. At O. Papadiamantopoulou 2 LRom walls, one of opus testaceum and at O. Votsari 29 three rooms of a Rom house, one with a mosaic floor (Fig. 61), were investigated. At O. Boukaouri 101 a Rom bathhouse with an apsidal room, hypocaust, cisterns and drains, at O. Lontou 32 a wall of opus incertum and at the junction of O. Syntagmatar- chou Zisi and Leophoros Arois a LRom cistern were investi- gated. Elsewhere, parts of a Byz structure at O. 6ou Syntagmatos 10, a Rom nymphaeum with a niche in opus reticulatum at O. Boukaouri 82, parts of two LRom houses at O. Gounari 153, a Rom house at O. G.

Orpheos and an anc. road at Englykada, O. Lochagou Menounou 37 were noted. Further evidence of the SW and S cemeteries of the city were uncovered at the junction O. Koumanioti and Asimaki Photila, where 49 Rom tile graves contained both adults and children, often apparently in wooden coffins, bronze coins, glassware and a gold danake, and at O. Koumanioti 29-31, where four cist graves and one tile grave seem to be grouped in a funerary peribolos. Further evidence of the city's Rom ceme- teries were uncovered in the form of two tile graves at the junc- tion of O. Notara and G. Chortatzi, two more at O.K. Satha, one more at O. Panepistemiou, a cist grave of opus testaceum at the junction of O. Ippokratous and Pesonton Astynomikon, and a cist grave belonging to a funerary peribolos at the junction of O. Kalavryton and Phokaias. Trial trenches in 32 locations only revealed sparse remains at Plateia Georgiou (Rom walls), and Byz walls at the junction of 60 Patras: Rom sarcophagus in Attic marble 61 Patras: Rom mosaic floor O.

Petropoulos (ADelt, 274) notes six damaged LGeo pithoi, five containing inhumations and one cremation. Finds include seven LGeo-SubGeo drink- ing cups (Fig. 62) and two bronze sphekoteres. ECh graves had earlier been noted at Agios Nikolaos. Lousoi (in anc. Arkadia). V. Mitsopoulou-Leon and G. Ladstaitter (Austrian Institute) report on a further excavation season (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 33-34) in 2004: 'A sounding in the SE comer of the LAr peripteral temple helped to ascertain the 1. of the building. Underneath a deep mod. fill, the foundations of the comer column were found, together with the foundations of the adjoining pillars of the E front and of the S room of the peristasis. The foundations, made from ashlars, and a superimposed oval limestone slab (max. 1.06m) for the comer column, are well preserved (Fig. 63). The structures, corresponding to the already known column founda- tions with regards to construction technique and level, indicate a peripteral temple with a peristasis of 6 x 15 columns (15.8m by 42.35m). A limestone slab (1.24m by 1.10m) with E-W orientation over ashlar foundation, found in the same sounding, indicates the S anta of the E front of the sekos. The foundations of the columns in antis, which have not yet been excavated, are to be reconstructed. In the W, however, the sekos is provided with a closed wall over a continuous foundation. The peristasis can therefore be concluded to contain an oblong sekos (9.7m by 34.5m), with, from E to W, a pronaos, an oblong cella, a further oblong room, and another oblong room at right angles. The lack of stone architectural elements suggests the foun- dations supported columns and superstructures of wood. At the time of writing, it cannot be excluded that the peristasis remained unfinished after the construction of the column foun- dations. The sekos, on the other hand, was certainly finished with mud-brick walls. A large ridge-tile found in 2004, together 62 Trechlo Kalavryton: LGeo/SubGeo drinking cups</page><page sequence="38">38 JAMES WHITLEY 63 Lousoi: column foundations in shrine with finds from previous years, proves the existence of a Laconian terracotta roof. According to analyses conducted so far, the peripteral tem- ple was planned at the turn from the 6th to the 5th Ct BC, and probably also constructed at that date. In the Hel period, the floor of the cella was renovated. The building was abandoned at the latest in the E Imperial period. In two soundings 25m W of the peripteral temple, the occu- pation of terrace I was investigated for the first time. The foundations and wall socle of an oblong building (8.1m by 12.2m) were found to be preserved; the building was aligned with the temple. The central structure, entered from the E, con- sisted of a rectangular (4.8m by 4.8m) and an oblong room (2.9m by 4.8m). At a later date, two symmetrical wing rooms Xwere added. to the N and S (02m by 8l 1 m) Nont commluniot ing with the central building, these were entered from the E. In the interior of the central building was found a 0.2m deep stratum of greenish clay, which served as substructure for the floor. This stratum contained predominantly Hel finds. An ensemble, found in secondary context, of four complete bal- samaria and three lamps dating to the 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC is worthy of note. Together with this ensemble was found a Geo bronze horse with flat base, made in an Argive workshop around the middle of the 8th Ct BC. A fragmented glass cup from the same fill points towards the construction of the central building in the 2nd half of the 1st Ct AD. The findings so far point to a construction of the central building in the E Imperial period, with the two wing rooms being added at a later date. An earlier wall suggests the existence of a predecessor with identi- cal orientation. The function of the building is still unclear. Should its date after the middle of the 1st Ct AD be correct, it would have been constructed after the peripteral temple and a neighbouring Hel stoa had been abandoned. The alignment with the temple might be derived from the preceding building. Excavations in the area of the Hel stoa, which is situated about 80m W of the peripteral temple and marks the centre of the town of Lousoi, were concentrated on workshop installa- tions found to the E of the stoa. First of all, the excavation of the oblong working area (4.3m by 4m), already known, was completed. The shallow pit was carefully lined with broken tiles. Immediately towards the E there is a circular pit (di. 1.6m) which was also lined with broken tiles at the bottom. This pit had been filled in with remarkably fine clay. In all probability, these installations surrounding a working space were connected with a workshop producing clay objects, in use for a short period of time after the abandonment of the stoa. The Geo to Ar bronze finds from the sanctuary of Artemis and the Ar to Hel architectural terracottas from the sanctuary of Artemis and from the settlement were studied in preparation for publication, as was the Hel pottery, with particular attention to material with relief decoration.'

Vordos (ADelt, 274-78) notes excava- tions of largely Hel and Rom, but also PH and Cl, structures and graves in six locations. At the junction of O. N. Plastira 49 and Mavrokordatou (Vergopoulou plot) five Hel graves (two cist, two sarcophagi and one tile) were investigated. All graves, apart from one (a double inhumation of adults in a stone sarcophagus) were single inhumations. Finds include strigils, amphorae, per- fume flasks, a Cor pyxis and a bronze mirror handle. At the junc- tion of O. Aigialeos and Pharazouli (Alexandropoulou plot) two Rom drains and one Rom cistern, probably connected to a near- by bath complex, had cut Hel walls; at the junction of O. M. Botsari 22 and Aigialeos (Konstantinopoulou plot) walls belong- ing to a substantial Hel structure lay next to a Hel cist grave containing four individuals. At O. Dodekanisou 6 (Diamanto- poulou plot) the only clear architectural elements in a complex of fourteen walls with (non-associated) sherds of all periods from Neo to Byz were a Myc wall and a Rom structure. At O. Elikis 12 (Razi plot) two (Hel and Rom) architectural phases could be identified. At O. Sarantaporou 14 (Rigopoulou plot) a structure (house) with substantial rectilinear Cl and Hel phases was fully investigated. The find of a rf krater fragment of the L5th/E4th Ct BC provides a tpq for the earlier Cl phase. The LHel (3rd Ct BC) structure was more substantial. Other finds inlude po nttery architectulral fragmentc an 1317 coins. EPARCHIA AIGALEIAS Rizomylos Aigiou (area of anc. Elike). At the Mitropoulou plot M.

Ladstlitter (Austrian Institute) reports on a limited season in 2004: Excavations continued in the Ar-C1 city on the so-called Terrace of Solon, immediately N of the acropolis (cf. AR 50 [2003-2004], 32-33; AR 48 [2001-2002], 34, fig. 64). Three sections were excavated in the vicinity of the public banquet- house, located in the SE comrner of the excavation area. The banquet-house, dating from the mid-4th Ct BC, was remodelled</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 39 64 Aigeira: Cl basin room into a private house at the turn of the 3rd to the 2nd Ct BC. The excavations revealed the foundations and stone socles of a sys- tem of walls, corresponding to the orthogonal plan of the exca- vated building. Differing depths of the foundations and numer- ous instances of abutting walls indicate a number of building phases. Their sequence is as follows. In the E of the service annexe, which included a well and a cistern, and to the S of the rooms intended for public use, was found a pavement of river pebbles which is contemporaneous with the banqueting house. The pavement, as an open-air area, suggests the existence of a back yard or a street. Subsequently, but still contemporaneous with the banquet- house, a building was erected in this location, of which a U- shaped wall (6.20m 1.) is preserved. The deviating axes of the N-S running walls prove the building to be a structure inde- pendent of the banquet-house. This is further borne out by the lack of connection to the service annexe in the W, with a utili- tarian space with large boulders situated in between. The next building phase is a systematic enlargement of the banquet-house to the S and E, following the partial demolition of existing walls. New walls, erected in one coherent phase and corresponding exactly with the N-S axis of the previous ban- queting house, have been found to define five new rooms, extending the house by two rooms to the S and one room to the E. The use level of these rooms is 0.85m higher than that of the banquet-house, following the natural terrain. A partially exca- vated room in the SE comer features a water-proof floor, made from river pebbles laid in mortar. In the SW corner of this room was found a circular basin (di. 0.30m, d. 0.37m), sunk into the floor (Fig. 64). A door leading to the S, later walled up, sug- gests a further room in this direction. In the W there is a notably spacious room (6.50m by 4.50m), with two smaller rooms join- ing towards the S (w. 2.70m and 3.20m). A wall discernible at the surface 7m further to the S, aligned with the axes of the ban- quet-house, suggests that this group of rooms extended from the banquet-house towards the S for up to 14m. The extension thus comprises an area about 170m2. Even though, with the excep- tion of the 'wet room', no function can as yet be assigned to these rooms, the varying sizes of the rooms illustrate a room programme differentiated by function in the wider context of domestic architecture. Four well-preserved dishes were found in a levelling stra- tum, abutting the walls, where a wall of the earlier building had been removed. These finds date the extension to the turn of the 3rd to the 2nd Ct BC. The date of the abandonment of the part of the building excavated in 2004 is indicated by finds from a fill introduced after the demolition and removal of the walls. The ensemble consists of a complete amphora, a grey dish and an oil flask, dating the fill to the end of the 1st Ct BC. The 2004 excavations helped to illuminate the history of the building and illustrated the remodelling of the public banquet- house into a private house. A recent finding is that a structure to the S, independent from the banquet-house, had been removed for this alteration. It also became apparent that the later private house was much larger than had originally been estimated. Sigrid Jalkotzy and Eva Alram, together with collaborators (Mykenische Komission der Osterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Vienna), continued the study of PH material in the museum of Aigio, in preparation for the final publication.

Characteristic for the area is a fine yellow soil, known locally as latipi, the result of the weathering of the soft lime- stone. Eighty tracts surveyed over two three-week seasons have yielded cultural material; twenty PH to Med pottery. Overall the periods represented are Neo (lithics only), EH II, MH, LH III, Cl, Hel, Rom, Med, Byz, Emod. The identification of actu- al sites and considerations of site size and function must await systematic gridding and geomorphological assessment. Low artefact densities are characteristic of the landscape, while PostMed landscape changes, such as extensive terracing, soil instability, quarrying and probably tectonic activity have caused significant landscape alterations. BA pottery (EBA-LBA) has so far been identified at four locations only. The terraces above and below the 'Black cave' at Kangelisses, below the summit where Kavvadias excavated MBA cist graves and Myc tholos tombs (PAE 1912) produced Myc, and PH pottery and lithics, some pre-dating the tombs and suggesting that this evocative landscape had a long history of use. MBA pottery found in two locations in 2004, 2-3km S of Kangelisses, is the first evidence of this date in the area. A sig- nificant concentration of artefacts was recovered from fields to the SW of the site of Kokkolata-Mylones sampled in 2001 (AR 49 [2002-2003], 42). They include the identification of a pos- sible Rom farmstead, where part of the rims of two different large pithoi/dolia (Fig. 66) and a Rom imperial sestertius were collected. At the edge of a tract immediately to the S, an Ar stele with the inscription &lt;D&gt;AMIADA (Fig. 67) was found with hewn blocks and a mod. olive press pan, a group possibly intended for the nearby lime kilns. A re-used column drum and other architectural elements were incorporated into the nearby PostMed chapel of Archangeloi, now in ruins. With only small numbers of diagnostic sherds, the Byz period remains elusive, while mod. pottery is the best represented in most sectors. The frequency of large wine jugs, mostly 17th- 18th Ct, with charac- 67 Livatho Valley: Ar inscription teristic mustard and green coloured glaze, reflects the local land use during the Venetian period, namely the monocaliergia of the vine for currants, which was superceded in the 19th Ct by the expansion of olive cultivation. Apart from the study of the post Byz pottery, to be undertaken by Tainia Rigakou, the project has also located and recorded the surviving vernacular architecture and agricultural installations, such as oil and wine presses, windmills and cisterns, to be studied primarily by Regina Razi of the Office of Modem Monuments on Kephallenia.

Playia Survey. The DAI reports on the 2004 season of the Playia Survey, conducted under the direction of Lazaros Kolonas (Greek Archaeological Service), Franziska Lang (Humboldt-Universitdit, Berlin), Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner and Peter Funke (Universittit Miinster): 'The areas examined in 2004 were the W coast along the channel of Leukas and the NW of the Playia peninsula sur- rounding the church of Ag. Athanasios and the village of Peratia. In the centre of the peninsula, the range of hills of Kastri, Pastas and the surroundings of the church of Ag. Nikolaos were studied. The area around the village of Sten6 and the urban area of the anc. city of Palairos in the E half of the peninsula were surveyed. The topographical situation was varied and included coastal and beach areas, plains, hills and mountains. Numerous previously unknown sites, ranging from the EBA to the E20th Ct AD, were also discovered. In the area surrounding the anc. city of Palairos, the S ceme- tery and surroundings were surveyed. The finds were plentiful, despite the severe destruction of the cemetery by bulldozing. The remains of stone cist tombs, bases of stelae, some inscribed tomb stones and plenty of fragmented vessels and tiles docu- ment the use of the area from the Ar to the Rom period. S of the cemetery numerous remains of a previously unknown set- tlement were identified. The material found dates from antiq- uity to the Middle Ages. Anc. stones were re-used in later hous- es. To the NW of Palairos, examinations included a previously known sanctuary, associated with Artemis. The sanctuary is situated along the road leading towards the Voulkaria lake below Palairos. Cuttings in the bedrock, isolated wall remains, pottery and tiles can be recognized underneath the dense mac- chia-type vegetation. A known statue base with inscription was found to be still in place (Fig. 68). Fragments of terracottas are further indications of a sanctuary. The finds can be dated to the Cl to Hel periods. The systematic survey of the Profitis Elias mountain to the W of Palairos resulted in new information about the phases of occupation. In addition to the mod. church and a Byz church built from spolia, an anc. temple of Doric order and a monu- mental altar have been known to exist for a long time. Also,</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 41 foundations of several buildings of anc. and Byz date can be recognized on the plateau and on the E slope. The widely dis- persed architectural fragments, such as capitals, columns and architectural terracottas, belong to the temple and suggest a date in the LCl period. In this year's systematic examination of the plateau, in addition to a large number of stone and clay archi- tectural fragments of the temple and the altar, fragments of an Ar terracotta roof were also found associated with the temple. This surprising find (Fig. 69) testifies to a temple built in the Ar period and subsequently reconstructed a number of times until the Hel period. A plentiful collection of fragments of terracot- tas, pottery and tiles on the S slope can be explained as a dump for artefacts that were no longer in use. A Byz settlement and the remains of a hitherto unknown grave tumulus were discovered in the area surrounding the vil- lage of Stend, in addition to isolated traces of hamlets of vari- ous periods. The tumulus, encircled with a row of stones, could be seen to contain five tombs of as yet unknown date. Some of the pottery found in the area can be dated to the EBA and might suggest a date for the grave tumulus. The survey of the anc. fortification of Trikorpho, measur- ing about 20m by 20m, yielded no finds except a few Cl and Hel fragments. The fortification was documented. As the structure had never been built over, the scarcity of finds suggests a planned abandonment. In the W of the peninsula, along the channel of Leukas, a markedly larger predecessor to the mod. church of Ag. Georgios and the remains of a multi-phase fortification, all situated on the hill of Paliochalia, were documented. The for- tification had apparently been used by the Venetians as a main- land base for securing the island of Leukas. It can be added to a line of similar fortifications, such as Ag. Georgios in Nea- Playia and Ag. Mavra near Leukas, designed to secure the straits from N to S. The installation at Paliochalia is situated at the narrowest point of the straits and thus had important securi- ty functions. It was redesigned in the Ot period and continued in use. In the 19th Ct the structure housed a customs station, attested by various buildings and moles. The foundations of several brick kilns are preserved towards the N along the coast- line; finds from the area suggest a date in the L19th Ct. At the site of Rouga, stone slabs can be seen in the water, leading far out into the sea. The slabs are part of an anc. street leading onto a bridge. In anc. times, the bridge spanned the channel of Leukas, and in the E20th Ct Dbrpfeld could still see remains of supports standing in the channel. In the NW of the peninsula, in the vicinity of the church of Ag. Athanasios, remains of a Med fortification commanding a good view over the straits of Leukas and the central parts of the Playia peninsula were found. To the SE of this fortification there were concentrations of stone chips, possibly indicating a PH stone tool manufacturing area. 68 Playia Survey: Cl-EHel statue base with inscription 69 Playia Survey: Ar terracotta roof fragments An E mod. village with low density of occupation was found to stretch over a hill in the vicinity of the village of Peratia. In the centre of the peninsula, and in particular on the hill of Kastri, mod. anthropogenic activity is so severe that architec- tural remains reported by Dbrpfeld are no longer visible. In some places, remains of anc. graves (Cl to Hel and Rom) are visible in the cuttings for mod. road works; these graves pre- sumably belong to cemeteries in the vicinity. Overall, sites dating to the Rom period, according to first estimates, are concentrated in the W of the Playia peninsula, whereas pre-Rom sites were dominant in the surveyed areas around, and to the S of, the anc. city of Palairos.

Soren Dietz (Danish Institute) and loannis Moschos (36th EPCA) report on further excavations in 2004: 'Excavations were carried out in the lower part of the anc. town inside the W gate and restoration work was completed on the acropolis. In addition, geomagnetic surveys were continued 72 Kalydon: Hel kiln inside the fortification wall in order to get a more detailed pic- ture of the city plan. In the lower town, work continued in the large building inside the W gate where a stone built staircase, parts of a col- umn base and a cult room containing several marble objects, tiles and pottery were found during the 2003 campaign. In 2004 fieldwork in the large building concentrated in the area between the cult room in the NW comer and the staircase (Fig. 71). In the room E of the cult room (slightly less than 5m by 6m) a square grey limestone base for a bronze statue was situated in the centre of the room, straight in front of the doorway between the two rooms. The doorway itself has an elaborate threshold, likewise of grey limestone. An inscription on the base informs us that the statue had been dedicated to the town and the Gods by a certain Sosikles and that it was made by Alexarchos from Sikyon. Plaster, sometimes painted, was preserved on the walls, and parts of a painted sima and well-preserved antefixes were found on top of the floor made of broken stones in con- crete. The plinth for the columns in the central part of the building was further excavated, confirming it (provisionally) as part of a central peristyle. A deep well cut into the bedrock was found in the NW comer of the room. It has been excavated to Ar levels of the 6th Ct BC. Studies of the pottery indicate the use of many thymiateria and lamps in the cult room and that activity in the building itself continued from the 3rd Ct BC to the mid-Ist Ct AD. Further up in the lower town, on the W side of the main road leading from the W gate towards the acropolis, a Hel tile and pottery kiln, the excavation of which started in 2003, was finally uncovered (Fig. 72). It was unusually well preserved, revealing many details of its construction and use. Geomagnetic surveys continued from the previous years, especially in the E part of the town, around the E gate. Preliminary results seem to indicate that the anc. agora was sit- uated near the E gate and that this gate (not the W one as previ- ously suggested) had actually been the main entrance to the town.</page><page sequence="43">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 43 EPARCHIA OF NAFPAKTOS Kato Vasiliki (anc.

At Agia Triada more Hel houses were investi- gated, and on the W slope finds of Neo to Byz date came to light. Of particular significance was the EMyc (MH III-LH I) wall and strata of the 7th and 6th Cts BC. At the Panayio- topoulou plot only one of two LCl-EHel (4th-3rd Ct BC) cist graves contained a burial with Hel pottery (including 'Cor' skyphoi) and a silver ring.

At Langadoula (Loukka plot), Hel walls, at the junction of O. Botsari and Messenion (Chatzi- Kalpakiori plot) part of the anc. fortification wall and at Leophoros Antirrhiou a Hel circular kiln for the production of tiles and pithoi were investigated. More significant is the Hel tomb of Macedonian type investigated at the junction of O. Thermou and Athanasopoulou (Kotsopoulou plot). The lime- stone structure, 7.1m by 6.52m, consists of three 'rooms', two outer and smaller and one larger (Fig. 73). In the W smaller room were two burials. Finds, including fragments of marble doorways, iron nails from the wooden biers, and perfume flasks date the structure to the 2nd Ct BC.

Four phases of structures and tombs, dating from MH to Rom, could be defined. Walls of the earliest MH II-III phase were associat- ed with matt-painted pottery and 725 drop-shaped terracotta beads in grey fabric similar to those found at Eutresis. Walls of the next, LH IIIA2, phase were associated with pottery (strirrup jars, one-handled cups, kylikes), animal and female Phi, Psi and Tau terracotta figurines, stone buttons, loom weights and frag- ments of polychrome painted wall plaster. To the subsequent Hel phase belongs a large (sacred?) structure with a central peri- style court, with one room containing a pebble floor with a cen- tral mosaic in opus tesselatum. Finds include Hel pottery, coins (the earliest are 4th Ct BC) and the lower part of a statue of Atalanta. The final phase is represented by one tile, one trench and two cist graves, one containing four child burials. Orchomenos-Pyrgos road, Kydonia. Kathimerini (8/12/2004) and To Vima (8/12/2004) report the discovery of the Rom mon- ument (trophy) commemorating Sulla's victory over Mithridates of Pontus in 86 BC, one of two such monuments mentioned by Plutarch (Sulla 17-21). Fragments of limestone sculpture and the stone base with an inscription clearly bearing the names of Sulla and Mithridates in Gr letters survive. Kokkino. H. Koilakou (ADelt, 95) reports on the conservation of the murals of the church of Agios Nikolaos, attributed to the Theban painters of the Kontaris family. The works were limit- ed to the depiction of St Dimitrios on horseback. Akraiphnio (anc. Akraiphia). E. Vlachoyianni (ADelt, 339- 49) reports on further excavations as a result of widening of the national Athens-Lamia highway. More Geo-Hel structures and deposits and more of the Ar-C1 cemetery were revealed in several locations. On the N side a LCl burial was found inside earlier Cl walls. Nearby, in two locations, a thick burnt stratum containing over 25 Cl and one Ar female terracotta figurines, male and animal figurines, Cl pottery (some burnt, chiefly drinking vessels), three lead weights, bronze and burnt antlers and animal bone are probably to be associated with a Sanctuary of Athena. On the S side a section of an anc. paved road leading to Thebes and 159 further graves (103 inhumations, 56 crema- tions) of the chiefly Ar-Cl S cemetery were excavated. Of the inhumations, 78 were of adults and 25 of children, and com- prised the usual types (46 trench, 33 tile, seven cist, three pit) with distinctive treatment for children (eight larnakes, five enchytrismoi). Finds in the trench graves include pottery, fig- urines, strigils and faience beads. The bronze jewellery includes a LAr diadem from T.410 showing Theseus and the Minotaur in repouss6, and a Cl bronze mirror with a caryatid handle (Fig. 75) from T.440. This grave also contained an unusual rf lekythos with a plastic attachment of a winged Eros (Fig. 76). Other distinctive LAr trench graves include T.450, containing 46 pots and nineteen figurines, and T.439 containing 43 pots, two figurines and an iron sword held in the skeleton's right hand. The covers of the tile graves were Laconian; the chronological range (LAr-Hel, 6th-3rd Ct BC) was wider, even if the grave goods were poorer. The LCl-EHel (4th-3rd Ct BC) cist graves sometimes contained up to nine multiple inhumations. Finds include cups, perfume flasks, oinochoai and lamps, though the richest deposit was from an associated trench '3 :\kriiphliti:c, ('1 broitic'</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 45 76 Akraiphnio: Cl rf lekythos with plastic attachment of an eros, front and rear (Opferrinne?) containing 40 vessels, sixteen figurines and a bronze ladle. The Hel pit graves contained single burials, cups and perfume flasks of the 3rd Ct BC. Finds from the lamakes include faience beads and numerous figurines, largely of the 5th Ct BC. Animal figurines (chiefly horses) and bronze finds date the enchytrismoi in amphorae to the 6th Ct BC. Finds from the cremations (drinking vessels, figurines, bronze arm rings and strigils) are no more numerous than from the inhumations. Elsewhere the picture is less clear. At X.0 103,300, two Rom graves (one cist, one tile) seem unconnected to two near- by LCl-Hel structures or their underlying LGeo strata, which may relate to some nearby Geo walls. At road 3 Geo apsidal or oval structures (perhaps a sanctuary?) do relate to a cenotaph with a Geo amphora closed by another Geo vessel (Fig. 77). Nearby are more LCl-Hel structures. In the SE extension two large retaining walls seem designed to prevent the nearby Cl structures and well from periodic flooding by lake Copais.

The complex appears to supply a bath complex immediately to the E, of which the hypocaust was partially explored. Finds indicate both a Rom and a LRom/ECh phase to this complex, though the cistern itself may have been established as early as the L4th Ct (post 335) BC. Nearby (ADelt, 356) a grey limestone Hel grave stele is inscribed KA [ ..] AIETA. H. Koilakou (ADelt, 96) reports a study made for the removal of 19th Ct murals, to expose decorations dating to 1632 at the Church ofAgia Triada. Thebes. V. Aravantinos and E. Kountouri (ADelt, 323-36) report on excavations in nine locations. At the Museum site further exploration of the EH apsidal house and stone platforms (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 44) revealed many more EH walls and deposits, but no overlying MH or LH strata. Pottery was largely EH II, with characteristic T- rim lekanes and tankards. Other finds include cooking ware, obsidian tools and animal bone. An earlier burial was found cut into bedrock directly under the W apse of the EH house. Elsewhere, three other probably EH burials, and two further undated child burials (one cist, one trench), all without grave goods, were explored. The two MH cist graves, one containing a Minyan cup and bronze ring, bring the total of MH graves to ten. At O. Oplarchigou Vogli 3 (Spyridon-Vlachos, supermarket Dia plot) a deposit of 703 complete Ar (6th Ct BC) vessels, chiefly kantharoi and some kraters, has been interpreted as the product of a nearby workshop. At Pyri, near the railway line, where Hel complexes had earlier been found, an apothetis containing abundant LGeo-SubGeo pottery (kantharoi, kemoi, cups etc), figurines and metal objects of the L8th-E7th Ct BC was found beneath a rectangular (Hel?) structure with three rooms. The finds (some of which are as late as the 5th Ct BC) suggest the structure may have been a small sanctuary built over an earli- er Ar one whose foundations could not be located. Twenty metres to the E, a Hel house with several rooms, one with a floor of opus pseudospicatum, was covered with a thick destruction deposit of loom weights, faience beads, coins, fig- urines and Hel pottery underneath a collapse stratum of roof tiles and stones. At Polygra along the stream of Agios Yiannis two Hel structures were investigated. The first, with several small rooms, had a destruction layer of tiles. Finds beneath include figurines (one of Pan), iron tools, loom weights and lead weights. Pottery of the 2nd Ct BC included perfume flasks, skyphoi with relief decoration and cooking wares. Coins of 244-190 BC provide a tpq.

Fifteen lines of the central part of the inscription survive (the spacing is not exact): OAHM / UNATONA / AIOOIETO / OYKAITAT / YKHNION / QAFAAMA / KTQNIAIQN / TAEKTQNI / XHIANTA / TAKIAPXH / IIPEYB / ITAY. Professor V. Aravantinos, Ephor of Thebes, has provided the following special report on recent discoveries, particularly of the Myc and Ar periods, which have changed the picture of the city's history considerably: 'At E. Madi plot the rescue excavation in the suburbs of Thebes, Pyri (October 2000-June 2001), brought to light a built, rectangular 'theke' (or stone cist), 3.18m 1. and 2.18m w. (Fig. 78). It was cut in the natural soil of the area (pouro) and was built according to the isodomic system, with big well- dressed limestone blocks (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 38). The upper part of the 'theke' content was already disturbed in anc. times, while the strata close to the floor remained intact. From the deeper strata the finds that were collected included part of a marble perrhiranterion, four Ar bronze plaques, inscribed on both sides (Fig. 79), a bone point, an iron arrow- head and a bronze dagger. In the upper, disturbed strata two edge tiles with floral decoration, two bronze phiales, an inscribed kioniskos, part of an inscribed pithos rim, a stone base and fragments of a statue were found. The content of the kioniskos inscription (see AR 49 [2002- 2003], 44) is only partially preserved (Fig. 80) and is directly connected to events in 506 BC, to which Herodotus refers in detail (Herodotus V.77). The Spartans, in collaboration with the Thebans and the Chalcidians, tried to overrule the newly estab- lished Athenian democracy by invading Attika at the same time, but did not achieve their aim. The Spartans withdrew, after occupying Eleusis, while the Boiotians and the Chalcidians were beaten by the Athenians. For this victory of the Athenians we have information not only from anc. records (Herodotus V.77, Pausanias 1.28.2), but also from inscription fragments from the acropolis. The recent find from Thebes gives us, for the first time, the Boiotians' point of view on the same event. The inscription reads: ...]o; FOtv6a ' c Kt CAx / ...]se6vte; ic(ct) EXaoivoc /...]at XacKiid XmodXtcvot / ....]p)t gcvF0ctXv It is obvious then, that their limited success or considerations of propaganda compelled the Thebans to advertise their victory, and furthermore to give offerings to the gods or their local heroes (Kadmos?). The fragmentary inscription on the pithos rim appears to be of analogous anathematic content: ...]ot ave06[... The study of the inscribed plaques, three of which bear text on both sides, has not yet been completed. We have to note that, as far as the preliminary study shows, they relate to financial matters (land disposition, agreements between poleis over argu- ments for land possession, etc). Similar plaques have been found in Argos (see AR 50 [2003-204], 19-20). The function of the 'theke' and the origin of its content are not yet clarified. We know from Pausanias (Pausanias IX.23.1- 3) that there were sanctuaries, shrines and war memorials in this area of the polis. Based upon this information, but also on the character of the finds and the content of the inscriptions, we can hypothesize that the 'theke' was in fact the apothetis (the pit to discard useless material) of a neighbouring sanctuary. During the construction of the OSE underpass for the Thebes-Mourikiou road, 2km NE of the centre of the mod. town of Thebes, the bulk of one of the most important ceme- teries of Thebes was revealed (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 44; 50 [2003-2004], 39). This area was extra muros, in the plain stretching N of the town (Aonion Pedion). The excavation peri- od lasted almost two years and employed many specialists.</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 47 S1 klhcbc. ()SL undclrpass: hlcad of Ar kouro, In an area of 3400m2 (300m by 14m) more than 800 tombs of various types (pit, tile, cist, larnakes, enchytrismoi, crema- tions) and dates, and also funerary periboloi, were excavated. The area already contained a cemetery in the Final Neo period. From the LGeo until the Rom period (end 8th Ct BC-3rd Ct AD) it was also used for that purpose. The excavation produced more than 100 tomb stelae, 7,000 vases and many small finds. The tombs' construction, their position in the cemetery and the number and quality of the finds within a tomb, give us useful information about the art, econo- my, everyday life and mores of the Thebans for most of their history, including moving detail, like the couple buried together or animals honoured by their masters as if they were humans. Prominent among the numerous finds is the head of an Ar kouros (Fig. 81), found in secondary use in the SE comer of a Hel cist tomb (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 39). It is probably the only kouros from Thebes and dates to the last decade of the 6th Ct BC. Its discard, not many years after its erection, as indicat- ed by its extremely good preservation, was probably the result of the destructions caused by the unified and victorious army of Panellines invading the Theban countryside and blockading the town after the battle of Plataia. Another very important find is the LGeo amphora (Fig. 82) used as an enchytrismos. Found complete and with its lid, it is decorated with geometric, ani- mal and floral motifs. From the same cemetery is a stone inscription in secondary use in a later tomb. It bears two texts of exactly the same content. The second text, on the lower part, is later and is a later copy of the first one, perhaps because the former had become illegible. It appears that the first text was inscribed in memory of the dead of a war at the end of the 6th Ct BC and the copying took place in the 4th Ct. Besides the burials, an anc. road of considerable width made of hard, compact soil and gravel was detected in the cemetery. It is probably the odos (leophoros) leading to the Boiotian coasts of the S Euboean Gulf and Chalkis and described by Pausanias (IX. 19-22). 82 Thebes.

There were also found fragments of stone statuettes and perirrhanteria, bronze ophthalmotes phiales, bronze inscribed plates, bronze statuettes (Fig. 84), the upper part of the torso of a daidalic kore of limestone, pottery and stone bases. The cult here was con- nected to the family of Heracles and is mentioned by Pindar (Isthm. IV.61 ff) and Pausanias (IX. 11.1-2). In the E part of the plot a thick stratum of succes- sive burnings was found, mixed with large quantities of animal bone and Geo and Ar pottery. It is proba- bly the ash altar of Apollo Spodius seen by Pausanias (IX.11.7-12, 2) in front of the Electron Gates, or the so-called house of Amphitryon (Pausanias IX.11.1-2.1). The h. of the ashes was 2.5m and in the Ar period there had been an attempt to demarcate its volume by low walls. This construc- tion of ashes continues to the E, below the paving of O. Polyneikous. The excavation of this 'altar' revealed a large number of complete vases (and many assignable fragments), bronze ornaments, figurines and a seal. To the N of the ' altar' we found decorated archi- tectural members from the superstructure of an Ar building (tiles with plastic decoration, anthropomor- phic rainspouts, etc) and inscribed bronze vases, one of them in honour of Ismenios Apollo (see also Kathimerini [11/11/2004]).' For Byz Thebes H. Koilakou (ADelt, 95) reports on the conservation of three mosaic floors at O. Kevitou, O. Pindarou 29 (N. Koropouli plot) (Fig. 85) and 0. Epameinondas 60 (P. Meletiou plot). The lat- ter depicts animals and marine life. H. Koilakou (ADelt, 98) reports on the discovery of the W side of a tower on the W side of the Cadmian acropolis (E. Koropouli plot), built of large rectangular stones and bricks in secondary use, 1. 5.20 m. It belonged to the Byz phase of the citadel. H. Koilakou (ADelt, 98, 100) reports soundings that revealed traces of the semicircular apse of a new church at the SE end of the plot of the Church of Agios Gregory the Theologian (Fig. 86). Judging from the ceramics found, it was built on a destruction layer, dated probably to ECh times. Below that layer, a circular construction, identified as a kiln, was revealed. Tombs were also excavated at the S side and inside the church. H. Koilakou (ADelt, 101) reports on the springs of the river Isminos, located S of city, where a 12th Ct church (still extant at the beginning of the 19th Ct) was situated. It was dedicated by the Thebans to the memory of their benefactor, Metropolitan loannis Kaloktenis. The excavation did not reveal any traces of this church, but a conduit that supplied water to the city's water- mills was found. H. Koilakou reports (ADelt, 101-03) on a hoard of Byz coins and ceramics, as well as tombs and architectural members, found at O. Katsina (Karabitsakou plot). The finds belonged to a short lived 12th-13th Ct settlement. Below the Byz settlement, conduits and ceramics of C1 period were found. For O. Osios Klimentas, parodos Anastaseos, he (ADelt, 103, 105) reports on a large number of badly built MByz tombs. One of them bore traces of frescos, for 0. Anapauseos on traces of ECh walls, for 0. Loxis Falagas on the excavation of some tombs accompanied by jewellery, and for 0. Alamanas (region of Pyriou) on trenches that revealed 12th Ct tombs and coins (ADelt, 105). Tanagra. A.

Sylvian Fachard (Swiss School) reports on topographical survey of two forti- fied sites in the Chora of Eretria undertaken in 2004: 'The goal of the project was to draw plans of each site, collect pottery and extensively survey their sur- roundings. The large rubble enceinte at Myrtia, enclosing an area of more than six hectares was discovered in 2002. Apart from the well-built rubble wall, the main feature of the site is the density of buildings found inside, con- centrated in the centre and to the N. Although the first occupation of the site is PH (obsidian blades), the pot- tery and black-/red-glazed tiles tend to show that the site was mainly occupied during the Cl and Hel peri- ods. The Rom quarries of the NW and SE slopes have destroyed part of the wall, thus establishing a taq for its construction. Based upon its strategic situation con- trolling the main N-S Euboean road and its panoramic view over both sides of the island, Myrtia was inter- preted as an Eretrian military fort, eventually the phrourion mentioned by Plutarch (see AKunst 46 [2003], 96-97). The reality is more complex as the identity of the site remains unclear: it might be a forti- fied settlement. However, the absence of a nearby water source and the rocky surface argue against a civilian character. The fortified settlement of Tsakaioi is situated on a rocky promontory overlooking one of the very rare beaches of the Aegean coast of Euboia. The poorly conserved E tower protects the summit (73m asl), while the gate (Fig. 87) was defended by the N tower made of polygonal to trapezoidal masonry (L5th-E4th Ct). Access to the promontory is denied from the N by a rubble terrace-wall, while the cliffs to the S make any wall unnecessary. Heavy vegetation impedes survey, but several terrace walls structured the internal space, and building remains suggest that the area was densely occupied. A. Sampson, who discovered the site (see AAA 3 [1988-1989], 172), found some LNeo II pottery. Surface finds include Cl and Hel fine ware pottery (5th-3rd Ct BC) as well as a bronze coin from Eretria. The site was probably a deme centre in the 4th Ct (Histiaia), important enough to be fortified. Its position controlled one of the rare anchorages of the coast and thus played a role in the ter- ritory's defence.' 87 Southern Euboia Survey: Cl gate of Tsakaioi</page><page sequence="50">50 JAMES WHITLEY S I ctf;lldfdi-Nc~ropt) liN: 7;1 Eretria. St. Katakis (ADelt, 358-59) reports on the cleaning of the anc. theatre. Clearing of the cavea (whose stone seats sur- vive as far as the eighth rank) and the entranceways to the orchestra yielded few finds, though a coin of the second half of the 3rd Ct BC might suggest for the re-furbishment of this Hel theatre a date after the Rom capture of the city in 197 BC. A. Psalti (ADelt, 359-63) reports on further investigations at O. Glaukippou Dionysiou (Alexandri plot) in the area of the anc. agora (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 47). W of an anc. (Ar-Hel, 6th 1 st Ct BC) road, a C1 complex, with three architectural phas- es of the 5th-4th Ct BC, comprised three rooms. The earliest 5th Ct phase was marked by a (Persian?) destruction horizon con- taining burnt and fallen roof tiles. Nearby were two wells. Among the finds were re-deposited BA obsidian and pottery. Finds from a second Cl (5th Ct BC) two-room complex to the E included five glass 'eye' beads. To the S a LCl-Hel house had plastered walls. Less sense could be made of Cl and Hel walls further to the E, where finds included LAr, Cl and Hel pottery (especially lekythoi), lamps, moulds for terracottas and metal objects. Underneath the road, finds from three LGeo cremations in trenches dating to the first half of the 8th Ct BC underline Eretria's connections with the wider Mediterranean world dur- ing this crucial period. Finds include a gold band (diadem) with figures in repouss6, a faience scarab and four imported Attic pyxides. The pot shapes (skyphoi and kraters) are clearly sym- potic, the kraters bearing atticising decoration (one shows two horses) although they are likely to be the products of a local workshop.

Lemos (BSA/University of Oxford) reports on the 2004 excavation season at Xeropolis: 'The main focus of the second season was in region I which was investigated in 2003. Excavation in this area took place on the E-W axis and to the N between the E and W sectors of the 2003 excavation. It comprises areas K, L and M and covers twelve grid squares. Immediately adjoining these areas to the W, work was continued in area H of 2003: a further five squares were involved. Finally in two areas (N and P: another two squares), investigation of the earlier excavations of M.R. Popham and H. Sackett was renewed. The aim was to define the northern limits of the LGeo II apsidal building and under- stand better its plan. Area P is an area to the SW that had been left untouched then and which produced interesting results. Region II is located some 150m to the W. A series of individ- ual trenches (four sampled) was investigated here. In all during the second season, a score of 5m by 5m trenches (500m2 in total) was excavated: a figure comparable to the achievements of 2003 (Fig. 88). In region I (Fig. 89) ,it would appear that, in keeping with all the discoveries made by earlier excavations and the 2003 sea- son, the LH IIIC phase houses (Lefkandi phases 1 and 2) are to be found below the IA soils almost everywhere. It is also clear that these houses are in the orderly layout identified already by Popham and on the known orientation (i.e., skewed clockwise a little from the present grid of the excavation). It seems, however, that at the end of the LBA the part of the set- tlement located in areas K, L and M underwent an interesting change. Our excavation has shown that the structures built dur- ing that stage, at least in the areas so far examined, had their axes shifted to lie roughly on our excavation gridlines. The so-called SubMyc phase is mostly represented by ceramic material found in various fills; it is similar across the site. Interestingly, area P, located within the 'old excavation', has floor levels and walls, as well as some earthy deposits in local depressions of some magnitude, that may yield the first tangible, if fragmented, evidence for structures of this date. The EIA is represented by buildings and fills dated to the ProtoGeo and SubProtoGeo stages. In area P up to four archi- tectural phases span and give continuity between SubMyc and ProtoGeo proper. In Area N, below Popham's apsidal building, a substantial deposit of earth is associated with a series of post- holes. To the E in area L, at 1E one wall (82), probably indicates an edifice of domestic character. The most impressive piece of evidence of this period, how- ever, is a N-S passage that divides areas M and H. Originating at the end of the BA, perhaps as part of a re-organization of this sector of the settlement, it was extensively reworked in the EIA. This was a flat-based channel, some 1.50m wide, with a bank at each side, topped by a stone wall and presumable mud-brick superstructures above the walls 65, 66 and 67. The wall is of more than the usual proportions and built with large slabs and stones. Someone walking along this path would have been overlooked. Further work is required to determine whether it turned to run E or W within the settlement, or perhaps descend- ed the slope to the N to a putative harbour area below. Whatever its function, it might have been one of the entrances into this part of the settlement. The so-called 'Sunken Way' remained in use until sometime at the start of the LGeo period. At that time a decision was taken to infill it deliberately. LGeo structures are also found in the excavated areas H and M whose character changed after the partial and deliberate infilling of the 'Sunken Way'. Some of the dumped material comprised a loose mass of stone, bone and sherds with little soil. The ceramics associated with these soils are mostly SubProtoGeo and LGeo. Further investigation in the area of the LGeo apsidal building (wall 45) suggests that it possibly con-</page><page sequence="51">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 51 89 Lefkandi-Xeropolis: region I plan tained an internal cross wall (wall 75), a candidate for a post- base and a potential threshold (wall 46). Two other structural areas of LGeo date were investigated this year. The first is the LGeo structure excavated by Popham (now area N). We resumed research to the N of the limits set by Popham. A few more finds were recovered and some refinements to the earlier plans made (walls 79, 80 and 81). The second LGeo structure lies in the NW part of area M: arguably part of another apsidal structure (wall 87), but now too close to the N tell edge and on the slope. In region II, four trial trenches were placed on a N-S axis in two adjacent pairs separated by some 10m: one pair extends down the rather gentle slope of the hillside here, the other towards its roughly flat top. They offer different and apparent- ly contradictory stories. In one of the S pair of trenches under topsoil slightly deeper than usual, excavation revealed part of a regular Myc house. The northern pair produced some 1.75m of topsoil before reaching stone dumps, soil spreads of EIA date with some interesting LH IIIC ceramics and figurines. This curious juxtaposition means that within 10m a drop of at least 2.50-3m exists, with Myc placed far higher up to the S. This suggests extensive terracing in this part of the site. As in 2003, a large amount of pottery from all the periods mentioned so far was found. A number of sherds with pictorial scenes dated to LH IIIC middle (Lefkandi, stage 2) are among the most interesting pieces dated to this stage. They are decorat- ed with warrior scenes: two of them have scenes with warriors on ships (Fig. 90). Extremely important for the transitional period from the LBA to the EIA is the SubMyc and EProtoGeo pottery found in various areas. Some good quality SubProtoGeo and LGeo pottery was also found in connection with structures and walls of these periods. An almost complete MGeo II triple skyphos imported from Athens is one of the more noteworthy pieces of the 2004 excavation (Fig. 91). Among the small finds a number of figurines is notable. The most important is a frag- mentary piece of a centaur(?) (Fig. 92). Other finds include a LGeo seal made of steatite and bronze and iron tools, among them a copper alloy blade with traces of cloth preserved on it. During the 2004 excavation more than 100 bulk samples were taken from various floor layers exposed during the 2003 excavation season. Contexts included a house floor, road- ways, alleyways and courtyards.

PHTHIOTIS AND EAST LOKRIS (14 EPCA; 7 EBA) Mitrou (near Malesina). E. Zahou (14 EPCA) and A. Van de Moortel (ASCSA/University of Tennessee) report on the first season of excavation at this largely LBA/EIA settlement in 2004: 'An electrical resistivity survey carried out by Gregorios Tsokas of the University of Thessaloniki in September 2003 suggested the existence, in the NE part of the islet, of a walled organized town (ca 140m by 60m) with a large apsidal megaron (ca 16m by 10m), its structures located at a shallow d. of less than l m below the present surface. These results gen- erally agreed with the evidence of a surface survey carried out in 1988-1989 by a team of the Cornell Halai East Lokris Project, which showed that the pottery and finds in the N part of the islet are generally of better quality than those in the S part. The 2004 excavation focused on the area of the putative apsidal megaron and its immediately surrounding area, that is, on the S parts of plots 9 and 10, and the W half of plot 12 of the islet. We opened six complete trenches of 4m by 4m, leaving Im baulks usually on the N and E sides, and three partial trenches (Fig. 93). In all, we exposed an area of about 124m. Since the surface of this particular area had not been surveyed in 1988- 1989, we conducted a close-grained pick-up vacuum survey in 2.5m by 2.5m squares prior to excavating each trench. Below the plough zone, which usually was not more than 0.3m thick, we came upon well-preserved strata of the LBA and EIA. Excavation in most places was stopped at these levels, and did not exceed 0.7m to 0.8m below the surface - from ca +5.5m asl in the N, upslope, part of the excavation area to +5m in the downslope part. Excavation went deeper in only two areas: a sounding along the N edge of trench LL786, which reached a LH I stratum ca 1.3m below the surface (+4.92), and a deep cist tomb (no. 4) in trench LL785 located 1.2m below the surface (+4.6). The 2004 excavation expanded the number of pottery phases attested at the site, yielding pottery fragments dating to the ENeo, LNeo, EH I, SubMyc, and possibly the Cl or Hel periods. It now is clear that Mitrou has an almost uninterrupted sequence of human presence in the PH period stretching from the ENeo through the Geo period. Only the Final Neo phase (also called Chal or LNeo II) has so far not been attested. Such a full sequence of occupation in a site of moderate size is highly unusual in S and central Greece, and underscores Mitrou's potential importance in the study of Gr prehistory. Excavation uncovered 21 walls, all made of field stones, and nearly all associated with earthen floors. Walls and floors range in date from LH I or earlier to at least the MProtoGeo phase. All follow a NNE-SSW or WNW-ESE orientation. The longevity of this orientation is truly remarkable and indicates a degree of continuity in land use at the transition from the LBA to the EIA. Panagiotis Karkanas took micromorphology sam- ples of all important surfaces. The largest BA pottery deposit was a group of 26 mostly intact and mendable ELH IIIA2 vases found together with a</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 53 bone button, a biconical spindle whorl, and two pounding stones on top of a disturbed sandy layer in trenches LL785 and LL784, in the W part of the excavated area. This pottery group consists of four small drinking vessels (a conical cup, high-han- dled cup, two-handled cup and small kylix), four large kylikes, a large goblet, a krater, two dippers, two painted piriform jars, two painted angular alabastra, two medium-coarse cooking pots, a brazier, and a miniature cup and stirrup jug. Five kylix feet had been cut to serve as lids. Remarkable is a three-han- dled unpainted kylix in a local fabric (LL785-016-021). Nearly all the vases were lying on their sides. Many had been broken into many fragments. About half of the vases were burned to various degrees. This deposit obviously was not lying in situ. It may represent the inventory of a building that burned early in the LH IIIA2 phase and was re-deposited here in the ProtoGeo period when cist graves were dug in this area. One of the largest structures found this season was building B, dating to the LH IIIC phase. Building B is oriented NNE- SSW and was partially uncovered over a stretch of 9m in the SE part of the excavated area (trenches LN784, LN783 and L0783). We exposed parts of its W wall (wall 3) and two cross walls (walls 4 and 5) as well as two superimposed empty earth- en floors at ca +5.3 and ca + 5.45 in the rectangular room to the N of wall 5. No floor deposit was identified. With a w. of 0.7m-0.8m the walls of building B are the most substantial walls excavated in 2004. The W faqade of building 93 Mitrou: plan of trenches B was not identified. Either the W wall had been built against a rough LH IIICE cobble pavement to its W, or else it had been robbed out before that pavement had been laid, in which case it would originally have been even wider. It is possible that the S room of building B had two rows of three large rectangular col- umn bases placed parallel to the building's long axis. These column bases protrude above the floor of the later ProtoGeo building A, and were obviously used by this building, but their large size suggests that they originally belonged to LH IIIC building B. The NNE-SSW orientation and large size of build- ing B indicate that this is the putative megaron detected by the 2003 geophysical survey. Because of its size, larger than any other structure found by the geophysical survey, it is likely that this structure was an elite building. Without further excavation we cannot be certain about its shape. The LH IIIC construction date of building B is secured by the latest pottery fragments found on an earthen floor that was situated at ca +5.2, about 0.8m below the bottom elevation of its W wall. A burned antler was found on this floor as well. Building B appears to have undergone two phases of construc- tion. Cross wall 6, which is less deep than W wall 3 and stops 0.8m short of it, appears to have been put in place some time after the building's initial construction. The pottery fragments found below its floor provide a date of LH IIICM or L for the second building phase. The latest pottery fragments on top of this same floor also date to the LH IIICL sub-phase, indicating that building B went out of use some time at the very end of the BA. In the northernmost excavated part of LH IIIC build- ing B, N of a partially destroyed wall (wall 6) a small group of five complete vases was uncovered, consist- ing of a wheel-thrown cooking jug that contained bones of a quadruped, as well as four miniature hand- made vases imitating LH IIICM-L shapes. These vases have excellent comparanda in SubMyc horizon 7 at Kalapodi, a site located about 20km W of Mitrou. Because of the small size of the exposed area it is impossible to say at this point whether these vases rep- resent the last phase of use of the building or belong to a later grave dug into the LH IIIC building. If it is a grave, it would confirm that the large building went out of use during the LH IIICL sub-phase (Kalapodi horizon 6). This area needs to be excavated further. The contents of the cooking jug were left inside so that they can be removed in 2005 by zooarchaeologist Valasia Isaakidou. To the SE of this area, the plough zone over the ProtoGeo apsidal building yielded the top of a SubMyc painted stirrup jar (L0783-007-014). This vase fragment is similar in shape and decoration to Attic SubMyc stirrup jars, and probably represents an import from that area. The most important ProtoGeo structure found in 2004 was large apsidal building A. It was construct- ed inside the southernmost excavated room of LH IIIC building B, and was oriented WNW-ESE, at a 90 degree angle to this building. To judge by the results of the geophysical survey, building A is the largest ProtoGeo structure of the settlement, and thus likely to be an elite building. Its location inside LH IIIC build- ing B and its re-use of building B's walls and perhaps its column bases represents a remarkable example of LBA-EIA continuity at Mitrou. Parts of building A have been excavated in trench- es LN783, LN784 and L0783. The structure seems to extend further to the ESE, but it remains to be seen</page><page sequence="54">54 JAMES WHITLEY 94 Mitrou, apsidal building: ProtoGeo pottery 95 Mitrou apsidal building: ProtoGeo krater (?) how much of it has been destroyed by the spade harrow. The apsidal building was constructed with low rubble walls, ca 0.6m wide, and a mud-brick superstructure which had disinte- grated and covered the building as well as the area surrounding it. The apse of the building (wall 1) had been placed inside the S room of building B. On the N and S flanks of building A the ProtoGeo builders re-used part of building B's cross walls 4 and 5. The apse was separated from the rest of building A by two rows of three roughly cut rectangular stone column bases, which also may be re-used parts of building B. The W row of bases had a fourth, smaller, column base at its S end, adjacent to the wall, which was slightly elevated above the floor level, and must be a ProtoGeo addition. E of the column bases was a partially destroyed cross wall (wall 2) with a 1.7m wide central entrance. The area E of cross wall 2 was very disturbed and dif- ficult to interpret. The excavated area of building A W of cross wall 2 has a simple floor of beaten earth at ca +5.15. N of the entrance in cross wall 2 is an oval hearth built with fieldstones. The con- struction date of building A is not yet known. A small sounding of Im by 1,5m down to a d. of 0.07m below the earthen floor revealed the presence of a lower earthen floor at ca +5.08 but the few pottery fragments recovered from this floor were too undiagnostic to provide a date. The presence of the two rows of column bases across the apse suggests that building A had a second floor or at least a loft. The nature of this upper storey is uncertain. A dense layer of over 1,000 fist-sized stones was found covering the earthen floor and its floor deposit. It is possible that they represent the fallen upper floor itself, embedded in a clay matrix, but this would have made for an improbably heavy second storey. A number of burned clay building fragments found inside and around building A at Mitrou have impressions of reeds and wooden beams and show beyond a doubt that apsidal building A had a reed roof. A large number of clay vases were found on the earthen floor of the apsidal building. This deposit has only partially been excavated and studied. It includes pedestalled cups, jugs, kraters and pithoi. The pottery dates to the MProtoGeo phase, giving a solid date for the building's demise. Many of the vases are closely comparable with the pottery from the contemporary so-called Heroon at Lefkandi, some 65km SE of Mitrou, and possibly imported from there (Figs 94, 95). The bell shape of one of the kraters as well as its large size and the high-quality of its painted decoration are closely paralleled in the large pat- tem-painted krater recovered from the fill of the Lefkandi Heroon, and suggest a high status for the inhabitants of build- ing A at Mitrou, even though building A is only half as wide as the Lefkandi Heroon. Other finds include a stone spindle whorl, a perforated circular sherd possibly used as a spindle whorl and a stone loom weight found near the built hearth in the area E of the column bases. In the apsidal room W of the col- umn bases a fragmentary animal skull with part of a horn, a blue stone bead, a loom weight and stone tools were found with the broken pottery on the floor. In the sediments above the floor, a bronze ring as well as two spindle whorls, four perforated pot- tery fragments, two stone tools, a grinding stone, a crucible, a stone plaque and part of a terracotta figurine were found. The large number of objects crushed in place on the floor of the apsidal building suggests that this structure met a violent end, but it is not clear whether it was through natural causes or human agency. To the N of apsidal building A, a number of walls are strati- fied above the LH IIIC walls and may date to the ProtoGeo period (trench LM786). One has a rectangular column base stuck against it (wall 10). In the NE part of the trench, a col- umn base of unbaked yellow clay, about 0. 18m in di. and 0.2m high (bottom elevation at ca +5.72), was sitting on top of the comer formed by ProtoGeo walls 8 and 9. Its top surface, which appears to be original, reached into the plough zone. Because of its stratigraphic position it may post-date the ProtoGeo period. In the EProtoGeo and MProtoGeo phases, the area to the N and NW of the apsidal building was used as a cemetery. Five cist tombs have been excavated by physical anthropologist Sue Frankenberg of the University of Tennessee. They either con- tained child inhumations or were empty. The tops of five more cist tombs were partially exposed but not excavated because they were sitting deeply in the baulks. A disturbed cist grave (cist 5) belonging to a four to seven year old child was partially excavated against the W baulk of trench LL786. It contained a clay cup datable to the very end of the LH IIIC phase or the EProtoGeo phase. Some 5m to the E, cist 2 was sitting on top of two ProtoGeo walls, not far from the clay column base. It had been disturbed by the plough and was found empty. A few meters to the E of it, cists 1 and 3 were found on top of one another in the N baulk of trench LM786. The upper tomb (cist 1) had roughly the same elevation as cist 2 and contained the bones of a very young child. An intact unpainted clay cup datable to the MProtoGeo phase was found outside this tomb, and may have belonged to it. The lower tomb (cist 3) contained three successive child burials separated by pebble layers. The first and lowest burial was that of a six to nine year old child, buried with an iron dress pin with bronze globe, a polished stone and four complete clay vases (a one- handled pedestalled cup, a bowl and two jugs) datable to the MProtoGeo phase. The pin was found in the left thigh area, and may have held a burial shroud. The second burial was that of a toddler, and the topmost burial that of an infant. A fourth bur- ial consisting of a foetal cranium had been placed in a pit dug from the surface of the cist all the way into the lowest burial, disturbing the upper burials in the process. To the SW of this area, about 4m S of EProtoGeo cist 5, cist 4 was uncovered to the N of wall 17, just W of a cobblestone</page><page sequence="55">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 55 pavement. It had been dug below the level of this wall and pavement. Cist 4 contained the poorly preserved bones of an infant lying on a layer of pebbles. The child was accompanied by an intact painted MProtoGeo cup. Lastly, some baby skull fragments were found out of context, mixed with disintegrated building material just below the plough zone in the centre of trench LN786. The latest date of the pottery of this layer was LH IIIC. With its well-preserved remains, Mitrou has proven to be a promising site for the study of the BA to IA transition in the Euboean Gulf, which formed a maritime as well as a terrestrial passage between N and S Greece.'

Oileos and Androutsou near a ceramic drainpipe and a cistern an apothetis contained Hel to Rom finds, including loom weights stamped M; and at O. Perdika Byz walls. Livanates. Ph. Dakoronia (ADelt, 395) notes LByz floor levels at Ovria. Kalapodi. Ph. Dakoronia and S. Dimaki (ADelt, 394-95) report on the excavation of four Myc chamber tombs NW of the vil- lage (Daliani-Bakandritsou plot). Three of the tombs (II, III and IV) had a square chamber and tomb I had a circular chamber. Tomb II had been looted, but the other three yielded artefacts of LH IIA-LH IIIC date. Rich finds included alabastra, pithos- amphorae, kylikes, bronze weapons (arrowheads, spearheads), a bronze sword with a hilt inlaid with ivory, a bronze mirror, cornelian beads and sealstones, sealstones of rock crystal(?), gold beads, several decorated gold finger rings, one with a rep- resentation of an animal (Fig. 96), another with a pos- sible representation of cult activity, two gold neck- laces, gold rosettes and numerous other finds in bronze. W.-D. Niemeier (DAI Athens) reports on work at the anc. Sanctuary of Artemis and Apollo at Hyampolis): 'After an interruption of 22 years, excavations in the sanctuary at Kalapodi (on the earlier excavations see lastly AR [1982-1983], 32-34; BCH 107 [1983], 774-79; AA [1987], 1-99) were resumed in 2004 by the DAI under the directorship of W.-D. Niemeier in collaboration with R. Felsch. The new excavation project centres upon the S temple (Fig. 97), which was discovered in 1978 and only partly explored by the end of the first period of excavations in 1982, as well as on its predecessors. In a sounding down to bedrock under the Cl cult shaft and the adyton of the predeces- sor of the MAr temple a sequence of four clay floors and at the bottom a probable LMyc fill with a circular basin (BCH 107 [1983], 778, fig. 62) were found in 1982. Thus there appears to be a good chance that a sequence of cult buildings from the LMyc to the Ar periods, so far unique in the Gr mainland, can be exca- vated here, and that information about the origins and development of the Gr temple, as well as on a possi- ble cult continuity through the 'Dark Ages', may be gained at this site. The results of the 2004 season are described here in reverse chronological order. 90 Kilitpodi. r ccric n ccmlictc\ :,old rin1 Rom: The so-called Byz building, the preserved opus cae- mentitium foundations of which are preserved in I/K 24/25 (see plan AA [ 1987], 5, fig. 3 for grid references) and overly the east- ern part of the S temple is not Byz, but Rom. From the con- struction trench of the W wall come fragments of wall paintings and pottery sherds of the 1st Ct AD. Therefore the building appears to have been a temple of the Rom Imperial period. Cl: To the W of the cella of the MAr S temple in I/K 21/22 an accumulation of twelve column bases, a capital and a block of the stylobate of the second phase of the Cl N temple was found. The pieces were brought here in L Antiquity, probably to be transported elsewhere for secondary use. After further excavation here they will add to our picture of this important building. Ar: Of the parts of the MAr S temple excavated in 2004 the N peristasis between the fifth and the seventh columns was the most interesting. Next to the preserved orthostates of the N wall of the cella the level of the Persian destruction of 480 BC was well preserved. Between the fallen roof tiles and burnt mud-bricks, which had been covered by lime plaster with paint- ed and incised decorations, carbonized wooden beams and columns were distinguishable. Next to the positions of the three wooden columns, the iron remnants of chariots were found: at 97 Kalapodi: general view of S temple</page><page sequence="56">56 JAMES WHITLEY 98 Kalapodi: Ar iron chariot wheels column 5 two iron bindings of the hub of a wheel and two iron bindings of the axle of a chariot, at column 6 similar pieces together with the tyre of a wheel made in sections, at column 7 the iron parts of two more wheels (Fig. 98). The wheels appar- ently were votives and fixed to the wooden columns. Parts of wheels have been found in several Gr sanctuaries, but mostly in secondary contexts. The closest parallel to the find context of the Kalapodi wheels is the iron fragments of a chariot wheel found in the cella of the Ar Temple of Poseidon at Isthmia (I.K. Raubitschek, Isthmia VII [1998], 105, no. 336, pl. 56) with other votives, jewellery, weapons, tools (E.R. Gebhard in R. Higg (ed.), Ancient Greek Cult Practice from the Archaeological Evidence [Stockholm, 1998], 91-115). Several Apulian rf vases show wheels, together with helmets and shields, attached to temples as votives. Geo: Except its E end, the LGeo-EAr predecessor of the MAr S temple and the older buildings underneath it will be excavated by stratum. In the E, the foundation of the W wall of the Rom temple cuts through the Ar and Geo levels and to the E of it the latest floor, dated to ca 700 BC, of the predecessor of the MAr S temple was already reached by the earlier excava- tions. Therefore a 'pioneer' trench for investigating the stratig- raphy of the earlier levels was started here. Until the end of the season, two earlier burnt clay floors of the LGeo-EAr temple, lying almost directly above each other, were excavated. On the lower, near the E entrance, a hearth with grey ash and an iron knife were found. Next to it a Geo iron Griffzungenschwert (flange-hilted sword) came to light (Fig. 99). A little further to the N an iron sauroter (butt-spike) was lying on the same floor. In the fill under it more interesting iron finds were unearthed: the fragment of another Griffzungenschwert and an adze. Myc: Myc levels were not reached in the 2004 season. Myc sherds were, however, found in later levels. Some of them are of LH IIIA2-B date, a time in which the surrounding area was densely inhabited (see C. Morgan, Early Greek States beyond the Polis [London, 2003], 114-15). The sanctuary was probably older than LH IIIC, which has so far been consid- ered to be the period of the sanctuary's origin. For topographic reasons the sanctuary of Kalapodi was identified as that of Artemis Elaphebolos and Apollo of Hyampolis mentioned briefly by Pausanias (X.35.7). From the sanctuary there are, however, votive inscriptions only to Apollo, none to Artemis, as yet. After the identification of the Rom temple, the sanctuary of Kalapodi corresponds well with Pausanias' description (X.35.1-4) of the Manteion of Apollo of Abai which suffered several destructions and in which Emperor Hadrian built a temple next to the ruins of the great temple (which may be the Cl N temple of Kalapodi). Tithoreas. Ph. Dakoronia (ADelt, 400) notes the acquisition of two Hel marble grave stelae, one inscribed KAEOKPITA. Molos. Ph. Dakoronia (ADelt, 395-96) notes a large LRom rectangular cist grave, with a central inhuma- tion at the base, and several niches serving as ossuaries. Mt Oite area. M.Ph. Papaconstantinou (ADelt, 396) notes a looted cist grave at Dyo Vouna and another Hel cist grave with pottery and lamps of the 3 Ct BC on the Ypati-Ladikou road. In the Ypati area, a mor- tar was found at Alepochori, and a marble statue at Xeria Ypatis (ADelt, 400). Lamia. Ph. Dakoronia, M.Ph. Papakonstantinou, P. Dougia and A. Stamoudi (ADelt, 376-85) report on excavations, principally of Hel to Rom graves and Hel structures, at fourteen locations within this anc. and Med city. At O. Panourgia 23 (Deligianni plot) fourteen more LCI-Hel graves (ten cist, four tile) of the SE cemetery yielded black-glazed pottery, figurines, lamps, a bronze ring and other bronze finds of the 4 and 3 Cts BC. Noteworthy finds include a bronze trumpet (salpinx) (Fig. 100) and a black-glazed lamp with lid (Fig. 101). 99 Kalapodi: Griffzungenschwert in situ</page><page sequence="57">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 57 1((I l(i)mi) : l t l bI )cl ll/c tlrullpcl I1 ilamial: i lblack la/c lainlp \\ ith lid At Parodos Amphiktyonon a MHel (2 Ct BC) tile grave, which had disturbed an earlier Hel burial, yielded a bronze mir- ror and pottery. At O. Ekklision (church of Ayioi Theodoroi) two rooms of a Hel structure, partly disturbed by three Byz graves, yielded loom weights, iron objects, bronze coins, Hel drinking vessels and a lekanis lid with 'W Slope' decoration. At O. Ekklision 91 and 42 more anc. (Hel?) walls, at O. Levaditou 13 a rectangular (Rom?) cistern and at O. Ippokratous a clay water pipe were revealed. At O. Amalias one room and several walls of a substantial (Hel?) structure yielded Cl, Hel and Byz pottery, bronze coins and loomweights. More evidence of the city's (Hel?) cemetery was uncovered in seven other locations: at O. Athanasiou Diakou 30-32 one cist and one tile grave; at the junction of O. Plataion and Tanagras a tile grave. At the junction of O. Achaion and Poseidonos four tile graves and one trench grave, and at the junction of O. Dorieon and Nephelis a tile grave each yielded perfume flasks and black-glazed pottery. More substantial finds of the L4 to 3 Ct BC came from the five (two cist, one tile, one sarcophagus and one damaged) graves at O. Anthilis (Miga plot). Apart from the usual black-glazed pots, perfume flasks, terracotta figurines, and an amphora of 'Macedonian' type from the graves, these include a Howland type 30B lamp and the first Hel grave stele known from Lamia, inscribed in three lines in letters of the 3 Ct BC: HOAEMAPXO 1-IOAYETPATO, AIlXPA. At O. Poseidonos 45 (Skarla plot) a Hel tile grave yielded figurines and an amphoriskos of the 3 Ct BC, and at O. Argyrokastrou 8 (Skarla plot) six damaged Hel graves (five trench and one rock-cut chamber) yielded a strigil, glassware, perfume flasks and three lagynoi, all of the 2 and 1 Cts BC. Environs of Lamia. Ph. Dakoronia and A. Stamoudi (ADelt, 385-88) report that a trench grave from the sports grounds of Agia Paraskevi yielded a Geo trefoil lipped oinochoe. At Sanidi, on the Lamia-Domokos road, near the site of a known Rom bathhouse, a Hel house complex with several rooms, some with distinct floor levels, could be dated by coins of the Thessalian and Aitolian Leagues to the 2 and 1 Cts BC. Some terra sigillata may suggest use into the 1 Ct AD. Though there are some slight indications of re-use in the 3 Ct AD, the next major phase is a LRom re-building, dated by lamps and coins of Gratian, Constantius II and Julian to the 4 Ct AD, and incorpo- rating re-used earlier material. In this LRom phase the complex seemed to function as a villa, lasting into the 5 Ct. The final phase is represented by 19 LRom-EByz graves of the L5 to E7 Ct AD. Finds include bronze fibulae, jewellery and finger rings. Domokos and environs. Ph. Dakoronia and M.Ph. Papacon- stantinou (ADelt, 391) note house remains dating from Hel to LRom and a LByz cistern at the church of Agia Paraskevi, and another rectangular cistern at Philiadona Domokou, Tsiphlikia. Melitaia. Ph. Dakorinia (ADelt, 395) notes a (Hel?-Rom) tile grave on the Melitaia-Makrolivado road, and a clay larnax with black-glazed pottery of the 4 Ct BC at Agios Georgios. A Hel marble grave stele was found in the church of Agioi Theodoroi (ADelt, 400). Limogardi (anc. Narthakion). P. Bouga (ADelt, 397-400) reports on prospection and excavation on this anc. city. Surface finds include a stone shield, of a type found on Macedonian memorials of the 4-2 Ct BC. Two enclosures were excavated. Enclosure I appears to be a Hel house complex. Beneath a col- lapse layer of Laconian tiles, finds included a marble statue of a boy, loom weights, lamps, bronzes and pottery (perfume flasks, etc) of the 4 and 3 Cts BC. Enclosure II, built over an earlier Myc stratum, was another Hel house complex, whose earliest finds (black-glazed lamps and lekanis) are of the L4-E3 Ct BC. Installations appear to include two hearths. The com- plex was covered by a collapse layer of tile and pottery, dated by a coin of the Thessalian League to the E2 Ct BC. Nearby was a robbed double Hel cist burial, whose finds (figurines, lag- ynoi, and Howland type 27D lamps) are of the L3-E2 Ct BC. Stylida. M.Ph. Papaconstantinou (ADelt, 391) notes anc. walls at the junction of O. Dioletti and Karyas. Karavomylos. A. Stamoudi (ADelt, 396-97) notes several destroyed or damaged Cl tile graves SW of the village. Finds of the L5-4 Ct BC include black-glazed cup kantharoi and figurines. Achinos. M.Ph. Papaconstantinou (ADelt, 388-89) notes a (Cl? Hel?) cist grave at the Papadimitriou plot and (Cl? Hel?) walls, probably from a house complex, at O. Achilleos (Syngouni plot). Pelasgia. A. Stamoudi and M.Ph. Papaconstantinou (ADelt, 391-94) report on excavations in two locations. At Agios Konstantinos a complex of two C1 courtyard houses of the 'pastas' type contained identifiable hearths, though room func- tions could not be assigned. Finds sealed by a collapse layer of tiles include plain (lekanes, amphorae) and black-glazed (cups, kylikes, kantharoi, olpes, pyxides, etc) pottery, loom weights, bronze fish-hooks, lead net weights, iron tools, bronze jewellery (fibulae, pins, etc), stone mortars and coins. The most notable find is an attic rf krater of the mid 5 Ct BC from the workshop of the Niobid painter, repaired in antiquity, with scenes of the Apollonian trinity/triad (on one side) and of Theoxenia of the Dioskouroi (on the other). Several LHel-ERom tile and cist graves cut into the C1 levels contained lamps, lagynoi, bronze jewellery, iron spearheads and arrowheads, a sealstone and coins. The final use of the site is represented by an ECh cist grave with niche and apse. At Koumouli (Stavrou plot), a PH (probably MH) tumulus (tymvos), 7m in di., ca 2.64-3.56m high, was investigated. Two later (Rom? Byz?) burials had been dug into the top, and trenches around the edge yielded Minyan and hand-made pot- tery. The central area will be investigated in future seasons.</page><page sequence="58">58 JAMES WHITLEY THESSALY (with NORTHERN SPORADES) NOMos OF MAGNESIA (13 EPCA; 7 EBA) Achilleio Pteleou. Z. Malakasioti (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 422) notes nine probably LRom-ECh trench graves (with few if any grave goods) at Lychouda/Lychoudes/Lychoures. Sourpi, Pontika. V. Rontiri (ADelt, 434-36) reports on the excavation of a MHel-ERom farmstead, with several rooms arranged around a central court. A tile collapse layer could not be dated precisely, but finds of pyramidal and circular loom weights (some stamped), bronze and iron tools, faience beads, glasswares, some black-glazed pottery, terra sigillata and coins of Trajan broadly date its period of use. Anavra/Goura. Z. Malakasioti (ADelt, 423) reports on the excavation of two disturbed EIA tholos tombs at Charamolongos/Koumarorachi. Both tombs were small (2.25- 2.6m di.), and tomb I contained an internal trench. The inhumed bones and teeth of both adults and children were accompanied by an iron sword, bronze finger rings and larger rings (for arms or ears?), of the 10-9 Ct BC. No pottery was found, but coins indicate later (Rom?) re-use. National road, Agios Theodoros-Almyros section. V. Rontiri and E. Nikolaou (ADelt, 426-33) report on the results of rescue excavations undertaken in advance of widening the national road. Going from S to N, the following sites were investigated. Mesorrachi. Finds of E-MBA pottery, flint, obsidian, quernstones, loom weights and some bronze, but without any architectural context, probably indicate PH settlement on a nearby hill. Palaiopigada. Tile collapse from a LHel-MRom structure, probably a farmstead, covered several rooms and a hearth. Finds include pottery, glassware, iron tools, bronze jewellery and some residual flint, largely of the 1-3 Ct AD. Pontika. A cairnm covered probably Rom cremations. Finds include bronze coins, and residual flint tools. Drymon, Kamara. Two phases of a substantial Neo settle- ment with post-hole 'wattle and daub' structures were revealed. Finds include mono, burnished and painted pottery, including 'Linear Style', 'Solid Style', 'Flame Pattern' and 'bor'. The variety of chipped stone (both flint and obsidian) and ground stone types was enormous. Other finds include 25 terracotta figurines, bone tools, animal bones (cattle and sheep/goat) and sea shells, some worked into necklaces. Velanidia Sourpis. A Rom terracotta drain pipe was found. Anc. Halos. A comer section (200m W section, 50m E sec- tion) of the Hel fortification wall of this anc. city was revealed. The wall, 2.9-3.1m thick, had two square towers (6.7m by 6.55m). Traces of an earthquake destruction (mid 3 Ct BC) were found inside. Other finds outside the walls include Geo infant burials, LRom adult burials, Geo to Rom sherds, a schist plaque from an interior wall inscribed HATPOKAEAX, and a Geo apsidal house containing five pithoi. Almyros. V. Adrymi-Sismani (ADelt, 407) notes the opening of a new archaeological museum in 1998. National road, Almyros-Aerino section. V. Adrymi-Sismani (ADelt, 424-26) notes the following (numbered) sites recovered during rescue excavation. X.O.296.500. A Hel farmstead with columns. X.O.296.000. Four Hel trench inhumations with coins of the Thessalian League. X.O.296.800. A Hel cist grave with two inhumations and a Rom trench grave yielded glassware, bronze coins, and loom weights. X.O.297.200. A Hel farmstead yielded loom weights, coins of the Thessalian League and pottery of the 3 Ct BC. X.O.299.500. Several paved roads could not be dated pre- cisely. X.O.296.550. A Final Neo-EBA settlement yielded a few surface finds, with signs of LRom disturbance, some hand- made pottery, animal bones, flint, loom weights, terracotta beads and indications of wattle and daub structures. X.O.297.060. A (Rom?) drain with hydraulic cement. X.O.296.820. Two rooms of a LRom farmstead. Dimitriada. A. Batziou-Efstathiou (ADelt, 414) reports on excavations conducted while constructing the fence around the site of the palace, which yielded first evidence of a building with foundations on bedrock and also a small Hel apothetis con- taining stamped Thasian amphorae. P. Triandaphyllou and A. Batziou-Efstathiou (ADelt, 414-19) report on excavations at nine locations in the town. At O. Lemesou (Papachatzi plot) substantial LCl-Rom house remains were revealed, with several architectural phases. The first 4 Ct phase, with rectilinear rooms, is dated by pottery and coins of Larisa and Corinth. Two Hel (3 and 2 Cts BC) phases are fol- lowed by two Rom (1-2 Ct AD), one associated with a mosaic floor. The Rom house seems to have continued in use until the L3-E4 Ct AD. Another Rom structure with a square room at Aivalotika (Makri plot) was cut by three LRom child graves. Outside the town, a Hel farmstead at O. Terpsichoris (Mavrou field) yielded only plain pottery. More substantial evidence of the city's Cl-Rom cemetery was revealed in six locations, at the junction of O. Panos 1 and Panakeias, at O. Prophiti Ilia, at O. Doulkeroglou-Glaukou, at the junction of O. Archilochou and G. Sterianou, at O. Argyrokastrou 11 and at O. Terpsichoris 28. The cemetery comprised 22 graves in total, thirteen cist (four LCI, three Hel, six Rom), four tile (one Hel, two Rom), two child's enchytrismoi (one Hel, one Rom), one (undated) crema- tion, the rest undated. Sparse finds were mainly Rom, chiefly glassware and Hel perfume flasks. National road, Aerino-Velestino (Megalo Monastiri) section. A. Douleri-Intzesiloglou (ADelt, 433-34) reports on excava- tions effectively on the outskirts of anc. Pherai. A large LC1- Hel farm complex with a central courtyard had three architec- tural phases beginning in the 4 Ct BC. Finds of note include numerous coins and Laconian roof tiles stamped KAEOAHMOY. A much smaller three-roomed Hel agricultural farmstead near- by was also roofed with Laconian tiles, and also yielded lamps, bronze coins, lead loom weights and Hel pottery with relief decoration. Two Cl-Hel graves (one tile, two trench) yielded few finds except evidence (in a trench grave) that a body had been burned on a bier. Velestino (anc. Pherai). A. Douleri-Inzesiloglou (ADelt, 436- 38) reports on excavations in ten locations within the anc. city. The most characteristic finds were LC1-Hel house remains, evi- dence for which was uncovered at O. Rega Pheraiou (both at the Paschou plot and the central market), at the Plateia Ypereias Krinis, O. Pheron (Apostolina plot) and at five other locations. MBA, Myc and Geo strata were also encountered at O. Pheron (Apostolina plot), and two probable BA (MH?) cist graves (with- out grave goods) were found at O. Rega Pheraiou (central mar- ket plot). Investigation of the Ypereia Krini revealed that this public fountain began as a LCl-Hel spring house, in which coins of all periods from the 4 Ct BC to the present had been thrown.</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 59 102 Volos Museum: reconstruction of Neo house at Dimini Sesklo. V. Adrymi-Sismani (ADelt, 410-11) reports on small soundings where several mixed strata of Neo and MBA pottery were excavated at the base of the new guards' house. Conservation work on the Neo acropolis (Sesklo B) to the W also continued (ADelt, 451-52). Dimini. V. Adrymi-Sismani (ADelt, 411-14) reports on further exploration of the Myc settlement. Geophysical prospection in an area of 10,000m was accompanied by excavation of a large structure with two wings. The N wing consisted of three large rooms, the largest being room 7 (8m by 8m), two of which (7 and 6) were connected by a long corridor (19m by 1.4m). The rooms had clay floors. Parallels of LH IIIA-IIIB date can be found at Mycenae, Argos and Eutresis. The S wing comprised ten smaller rooms, which may have served as workshops or ancillary rooms. Room 4 appears to be a 'pantry', containing drinking vessels (cups, skyphoi, kylikes), vessels for containing liquids (lekanides, hydrias) cooking wares and possible quern- stones. The 40 monochrome kylikes (Furumark shape 267 and 274) have good parallels both at Mycenae (see E. French BSA 62 [1967], 176, fig. 17 for comparanda from the House of the Sphinx) and at Pylos. This complex, not yet fully explored, seems to have been abandoned in LH IIICE. Further conservation work was also undertaken at the Neo acropolis (ADelt, 452-53). Nea Ionia. Z. Malakasioti (ADelt, 419-21) reports on the exca- vation of eleven ProtoGeo-EHel graves at Oikopnevma, O. Kolokotroni. The graves were of the usual types (eight cist, two trench and one tholos tomb) and contained both adults and chil- dren, but rarely dateable grave goods. ProtoGeo cist graves 2 and 5 and trench grave 9 contained drinking vessels, one krater, hand-made vessels, one weapon and bronze jewellery (fibulae). Cist grave 1 contained a (Hel?) strigil, and cist grave 6 an Attic wg lekythos of the 5 Ct BC. The small tholos tomb (3.76m di.) contained iron weapons, bronze jewellery (arm rings and fibu- lae) and whole pots of the ProtoGeo through to the E5 Ct BC, including an Attic bf cup. Volos. V. Adrymi-Sismani (ADelt, 407-09) reports on work in the Volos Museum, comprising various educational pro- grammes, including a reconstruction of a Neo house at Dimini (Fig. 102). V. Adrymi-Sismani, Ephor of Volos, also provides the fol- lowing report, especially for AR, on the recent discovery of an unplundered Myc tholos tomb at Kazanaki (see AR 50 [2003- 2004], 41): 'In the N outskirts of Volos town, at Kazanaki, during works for a water drain system in January 2004, a tholos tomb was revealed. The digging machine had already removed a fill of undressed stones, Im in h., before removing the keystone of the 103 Volos: Kazanaki dromos and entrance to Myc tholos tomb tholos. To the N and to the E of the tholos tomb five more adult burials were found (one built Myc, two trench, one trench with- out covering tiles, one tile). In the same area Theocharis had excavated, in 1963, a number of Geo cist tombs (I. OEoxprINg, N. Iwvia (BOXov), ADelt B Chron 18 [1963], 140-41). The tholos tomb was almost intact. The digging machine had only removed the keystone of the tholos, without destroy- ing the rest of the monument. The round chamber is 6.7m in di. and 6.4m in h. from the stomion; and 3.85m in 1. and 1.5 in w. from the dromos. The dromos is 8m in 1.; the rest will be inves- tigated in the future (the area where it extends is not yet expro- priated). From the hyperthyron and downwards, the dromos sides bore successive layers of clay coatings. The tholos tomb was built on an alluvial conglomerate mate- rial brought by the river Xerias, while the fill was also of light coloured soil mixed with gravel from the river. During the excavation we found that the fill of the tholos tomb was almost 3-3.5m in h. above the ground. The entrance of the tomb, 2.5m in h. and 1.4m in w., was blocked by a stone 1.5m thick which has not yet been removed (Fig. 103). Above the entrance there is a relieving triangle 3.85m in 1., 0.9-1.2m in w. and 2.5m in h., which is laid out on its lower part by a solid slab 2.5m in 1., 0.6m in h. and 0.15m in d. A stone beam placed above it removes all the static loads of the rest of the facing of the entrance fagade, as it extends into the fill for 0.7m on both sides. On this beam seven symbols were found inscribed in Linear B, interrupted by three shallow hollows that are marked with the symbol Ka (Fig. 104). These symbols are not of a decorative character, but they state the 104 Volos, Kazanaki tholos 7: Linear B symbols</page><page sequence="60">60 JAMES WHITLEY 105 Volos, Kazanaki tholos: LH IIIA piriform jar number of the buried. There are four big and three small sym- bols, for the four adults and the three children that have been buried in the tomb (the identification was made by the palaeoanthropologist A. Papathanasiou, who is studying the bone material from the tomb). The faqade was completed above the beam by the placement of a monolithic slab, 2.5m in 1., 0.7m in w. and 0.2m in d., which bore inscribed rosettes and volutes. Above this slab the facade continued up to 6.4m in h. as a low wall, 0.8m h., on which two stone slabs were placed (G. Soteriadis, AvaowacKi' Mapao0'va Praktika tis en Athinais Archaiologikis Etaireias [1933], 31-40, pl. 21). The excavation inside the tomb was conducted through the relieving triangle, in order not to remove the stone that blocks the entrance. On the floor of the relieving triangle were found the bones of an adult and a child, two seal rings, glass and gold beads from a necklace, a small tripod chytra (FS 320) (A. Furumark, Mycenean Pottery. Analysis and Classification [Stockholm, 1941], fig. 21), pithamphorae, and a LH IIIAl pithamphora (FS 19, FM 57) (P.A. Mountjoy, Regional Mycenaean Decorated Pottery I [Berlin, 1999], 105, fig. 19, no 98 and A.

The sherds of the LH IIIA1 pithamphora were found both inside the relieving triangle and outside it, exactly in front of the open- ing of the hyperthyron, together with sherds of a LH IIIC hydria (FS 58) (W.C. Blegen, M. Rawson, The Palace of Nestor at Pylos in Western Messenia II [Princeton, 1966], fig. 369, no 544). The investigation of the hyperthyron has not yet been completed. The excavation continued on the inside of the chamber. In the chamber's floor four trench tombs were opened. The buri- als were covered in a thin layer of clay, earth and sand, which had drifted to the centre of the chamber due to floods of the river Xerias. Such floods left clear marks on the walls of the tholos. The surface of the chamber's floor was covered by a thick layer of ashes (7-8cm), which contained small pieces of carbon and carbonized wood, as well as fragments of burnt and unburned human bone, and fragments of the burnt objects that accompanied the dead. In this regard the situation recalls the Lamiospito tholos tomb in Dimini (H.G. Lolling, P. Wolters, Das Kuppelgrab bei Dimini, AM 12 [1887], 136-38), Menidi (H.G. Lolling, P. Wolters, Das Kuppelgrab bei Dimini, AM 11 [1886], 438), Tragana Messenias (Sp. Marinatos, Avaoccail Ev 1IAXho. Tpacydvac. Ai6o OoXWooi t&amp;pot, Praktika tis en Athinais Archaiologikis Etaireias [1955], 252-53) and the chamber tomb in Agrapidochori (L. Parlama, Oalayoettil;g c&amp;Pog t; AypaxntioXpt HXefacc, AE [1971], 52-60). Inside the stomion, on the floor, big pieces of carbonized worked wood were found, while the traces of burning on the stone walls of the stomion are very intense. Traces of smaller fires in other parts of the chamber can be detected on the floor and the walls of the tholos. What remained after the burning, regardless of the actual number of the dead, was swept into three trench tombs. These were covered with stone slabs and sealed carefully with clay. Part of the burnt debris was scattered on the floor and on top of the slabs, while another part of it was put in shallow pits around the chamber. The only exception was the big trench tomb in the centre, which was found completely empty. The chiselled and rounded limestone slab that covered it, a big burial sema in secondary use, 4m in i., 0.65m in w. and 0.2m in d., had been removed. The investigation showed that the bones of seven dead with the objects that accompanied them were burnt in a secondary burning (at a temperature higher than 3000C) inside the cham- ber. The cremated remains were swept into the trench tombs together with burnt objects. Undecorated pottery was used for this ceremony. The secondary burning was incomplete and this is why some of the bones were swept unburned to the sides of the tholos, and why a skull without any trace of burning was found next to the stone that blocks the entrance. The bones found on the hyperthyron are also unburnt, but the sherds found with them bear traces of intense burning. It is interesting that sherds of the same pots have been found both inside the three trench tombs and outside them, in shallow pits. This is the rea- son why we consider it is impossible to establish a chronologi- cal sequence for the construction and use of these tombs. The pottery found inside and outside these trench tombs yielded 30 vases, decorated and undecorated, dating from LH IIIA 1-IIIA2 (Fig. 105), the period to which we assign the seven burials. The five/six undecorated lekanidia (FS 295) and skyphidia (FS 204) that were used during the burning ceremo- ny, like the decorated hydria outside the relieving triangle, belong to LH IIIC. The rest of the objects, mostly glass and faience jewellery, except the golden beads of the necklaces and the golden bands of the clothing, had been severely burnt. The investigation of the tholos tomb at Kazanaki indicates that we are dealing with a tholos tomb with an exceptionally well-built fagade, constructed in LH IIIA for the burial of an eminent member of the local society, whose burial took place in the central trench tomb. Later, by the end of LH IIIA2 multiple burials took place in the pit tombs 1-3. In total, seven burials took place: four adults (a woman 40-50 years old, two men 25 and 30 years old, one of unidentified sex twenty years old) and three children (five, eight and eleven years old), probably members of the same family. In</page><page sequence="61">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 61 LH IIIC and right after the destruction of the Myc palaces, according to the excavation data, a buming of the already decayed bodies of the tholos tomb took place, but no proper burial followed. The reasons for this action are unknown to us, but it seems that the aim was not the purification of the tomb, since no burial took place thereafter. This practice seems to be familiar in the area of anc. Iolkos. In the Lamiospitio tholos tomb in Dimini (H.G. Lolling, P. Wolters, Das Kuppelgrab bei Dimini, AM 12 [1887], 136-38), a similar layer of ashes on the chamber floor, 5cm thick, con- tained half-burnt human bones. The few sherds date the first burial to LH IIIA2. In 1996, when this tholos tomb was recon- structed and the relieving triangle was revealed, part of a human skeleton was found on its floor together with sherds of LH IIIC. We believe that the same practice took place in the tholos tomb in Tragana Messenias and in the tholos tomb in Agrapidochori, where the initial burial dates to LH IIIA and the secondary burn- ing to LH IIIC. Although cremation was already known in the Aegean from the M14 Ct BC, its origin usually attributed to the E and seen as a result of frequent contacts between the Mycs and the Asiatic coast, it appears that in this case we are dealing with a different burial ceremony. This concems the secondary burning of decayed bodies, many years after the initial burial, apparently in LH IIIC, after the fall of the palaces. If it is not a coincidence that the initial burial took place in LH IIIA and the secondary burning in LH IIIC, then the only explanation we can give is that the buming aimed to unburden those performing it from the dead, who in life were the main representatives of the Myc domination. The dead were not only burned, but also put in trenches sealed carefully with slabs and clay.' Kanalia. V.

In the Karali field, further excavation of the Rom house (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 54) yielded walls, loom weights, tiles, glassware, lamps, terracottas, iron and bronze tools and a bronze statue of Hermes Kedroos. Nearby was a LRom cist grave. Another Hel-Rom house, with similar finds, was identified in the Kissa field. More Hel-Rom graves (two plain burials, two cist, one tile and one clay lamax) came to light along the banks of the Pamisos river, and a looted (Hel? Rom?) cist grave was found at Chaliades. Nearby at Porti, Paliokastro three more LHel (2- 1 Ct BC) tile graves came to light. Finds include perfume flasks, an iron spearhead, and a coin of the Thessalian League. Argithea. L. Chatziangelakis (ADelt, 450-51) reports on rescue excavation conducted in advance of the installation of large electric pylons near the anc. site of Argithea, Ellinika. At pylon 134 three Hel cist graves had finds (lamps, coins) of the 2-1 Ct BC. At pylon 135 trial trenches revealed several walls and finds from Hel-Rom structures. Agnadero. L. Chatziangelakis (ADelt, 445-48) reports on excavation of LBA and Hel graves and a previously unknown Chalcolithic-LBA settlement at Chatzi-Mylo/Leivadi. Finds from damaged LBA graves include LH IIB-IIIB 1 pottery (stir- rup jars, pithos, amphorae, etc). The four undamaged LBA cist inhumations yielded few finds, including a LH IIIB alabastron, and faience and amber beads. The two undamaged Hel graves were sparsely furnished with pottery (e.g., an oinochoe) and 109 Agnadero, Chatzi-Mylo: E-MBA obsidian flakes bronze coins.

Other finds include spindle whorls, bone tools (Fig. 108) and tools of flint and obsidian (Fig. 109). NOMOS OF LARISA (15 EPCA; 7 EBA) Larisa. A. Tziaphalias, E. Melliou and A. Zaouri (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 455-57) report on excavations in three loca- tions. Clearing of the levels above the anc. theatre uncovered 400 or so marble statues, incorporated into later houses. Further evidence of the city's S cemetery was revealed; first at O. Seferi and Vyzantiou (Tsitsiouri plot) where twenty Hel graves (eleven tile, five simple trench and two enchytrismoi of infants) yielded pottery of the L3 and 2 Cts BC, including a Macedonian skyphos and 'W slope' ware; and at O. Poumariou, where two Rom cist graves (one with three skeletons) yielded glass beads, some from a necklace. Several Cl-Hel grave stelae (presumably from the vicinity) were acquired by the museum. These include one inscribed AFEAAOX, AYKEIOX in letters of the 4 Ct BC, another inscribed YEOPAXQ2: HPOQ XAIPE, and another inscribed NEIKH OPAXYAOXOY AHEAEYOEPA HPQIX XPH[Z]TH XAIPE. Kallithea, Kastro (anc. Peuma). A. Tziaphalias, Margriet J. Haagsma (University of Alberta), Sophia Karapanou, Sean Gouglas report on the first (2004) season of intensive survey on the acropolis (kastro), a joint project between the Canadian Institute and the 15 EPCA: 'The kastro at the village of Kallithea is an anc. urban centre located in Achaia Phthiotis. This site might be identified with the anc. city of Peuma, known only from a number of inscrip- tions. The city is a fortified citadel situated on a 600m high hill that closes off the coastal plain of Almyros on its W side. The river Enipeus encircles the site on its E side at a distance of ca 1km. The hill on which the site is located has two summits with a saddle in the centre. The visible archaeological remains consist of fortifications and wall foundations of public buildings and houses. The W summit of the hill functioned as an acropolis, which was demarcated by a large circular fortification wall. The external enceinte runs around the two hilltops and provided</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 63 00,, rAr 110 Kastro Kallithea survey: aerial view entrance to the city by way of two major gates. The surface area of the city, measured in relation to its defensive walls, is ca 34 hectares (Fig. 110). Friedrich Stdihlin, who researched the site in the E20 Ct tentatively dated the site to the 3 to 1 Ct BC. The goals of the archaeological survey of the Kastro are to establish the history and dates of occupation of the site, to explore the spatial layout of the city, and to analyse the distri- bution of artefacts and architecture on the site. In addition, the defensive structures of the site are being studied in order to compare them to those of the other new foundations in the region. This will be followed by a comparative analysis of the survey results within the broader context of previously studied C1 and Hel sites in the region. Our research this year consisted of four tasks: to set out a survey grid and to measure digitally the terrain and the visible remains; to study the individual architectural remains; to con- duct an archaeological survey aimed at collecting artefacts in relation to the grid; and to clear areas of the site of pournari where necessary. A relatively complete digital 2D and 3D map could be pro- duced of the natural elevation of the terrain. Laying out a sur- vey grid of units of 20m by 20m proved to be a challenge because of the large differences in elevation across the site; entailing a difference exceeding 70m. The team also measured the complete external enceinte, the acropolis fortification wall and some of the buildings and streets in the centre of the site. The architectural survey team's research focused in particu- lar on a number of specific features: the acropolis W gate; a small sanctuary within the acropolis; a large, probable public building in the saddle of the site; the main W gate in the exter- nal enceinte and certain sections of the enceinte. The archaeo- logical survey team surveyed ca 60 units of 20m by 20m, fol- lowing the Nemea Valley Survey Project in mainly collecting grab samples and unit mid samples (Fig. 111). At the request of the 15 EPCA, we located and mapped four tholos graves in the vicinity of the kastro that were described in 1964 by Dimitris Theocharis. The graves had been looted before 1964, but Theocharis dated them to the EIA, based on a description of the finds by the local population. In addition, one looted cist grave at the foot of the S slope of our site was mapped. The circular acropolis enceinte was constructed in several phases. Both of the acropolis gates have been enlarged at a later date and we found evidence of the usage of spolia and mortar construction in the walls of the W acropolis gate. Within the 5200 5100 4600 9800 9900 10000 10100 1020 10300 1040 1000 -1000 ~~1O6OO 111 Kastro Kallithea survey: plan of survey area acropolis, a severely damaged square structure appeared to be a small temple. Other structures within the acropolis consisted of an apsidal or round building (situated partly under the W gate) and a rectangular structure consisting of three rooms. It is dif- ficult to date the acropolis wall on the basis of architectural con- struction techniques alone, but it certainly precedes the phase that is represented by the majority of the buildings at the site, the EHel period (L4 Ct BC). The latest architectural phase (mortar) might indicate a Rom or PostRom date. The large building in the saddle of the hill was 5 1m in 1. and only 8m in w. Walls were preserved in some parts to a h. of ca 1.5m. Within the building we discovered one column base and one base for a stele. Based on its location and form and the way it opens up to a large open area, this building could very well be a stoa bordering an agora. The building has at least two dif- ferent construction phases, the first EHel (L4 Ct BC), the sec- ond phase of unknown date. The main W gate of the city is an integral part of the exter- nal enceinte. It is a fine example of a courtyard gate; a well- known Hel defensive structure. The archaeological survey yielded few diagnostic finds, almost all of them pottery sherds. Because of the diversity of activity areas on the site and various site formation processes, a significant difference in the number of artefacts per unit could be observed. Also, the different sampling strategies yielded dif- ferent results, analysis of which is still in progress. The date- able finds all point to the EHel period. Thus, the diversity in dates that we observe in the architectural remains is not (yet) reflected in the other archaeological material. Based on architectural evidence, we tentatively conclude that we are dealing with at least four or five different occupa- tion phases on the site. The first phase is represented by the EIA tholos graves that can be located in the vicinity of the later city. The acropolis wall was first built in a period before the EHel occupation. The EHel phase is represented by the major- ity of the architectural remains and the city layout as a whole as well as the diagnostic survey finds. In places, buildings of this phase appear to have been built over or repaired at a later stage, probably the Rom or PostRom period. The measurements taken of some of the housing blocks and streets indicate a city with a regular layout with houses, an agora, public buildings, wells and extensive defensive struc- tures.'</page><page sequence="64">64 JAMES WHITLEY NOMOS OF TRIKALA (15 EPCA; 7 EBA) Atrax.

A 5.5m, 2.8m wide stretch of anc road, in use from the 4 to the 2 Ct BC, at O. Pente Pigadon 250 (Geladiri plot) was flanked by a Cl-Hel house with three architectural phases (5, 4 and 3 Cts BC). Finds include 45 bronze coins of Ambrakia, the Epirot League, a Rom silver coin, terracotta fig- urines, a terracotta column capital and a small male glass head of 'Phoenician type'. Further exploration of the four Ar-Hel courtyard houses flanking an anc. street at O. Melaneos 136 (Thanou plot) yielded evidence of continuous habitation from the mid 6 Ct BC onwards. At least three architectural phases, the latest L3-E 2 Ct BC, a 5 Ct phase and an Ar one, can be dis- tinguished. The walls of each phase, in general, faithfully fol- low the lines (and thus the plans) of earlier houses. The houses continued in use until the 1 Ct BC, and in the Hel phase were roofed with Cor tiles. Finds include stamped tiles, bronze coins of Ambrakia and 6 Ct BC pottery. At neighbouring O. Irakleitou 222 (Lambrou plot) parts of two more houses were explored. The N house had three phases, one EC1, one MHel (3 Ct BC) and one LHel (2-1 Ct BC). Finds include pottery, bronze coins and terracotta figurines. Exploration of structure A at O. Tzavella 229 (Dova plot) yielded evidence of at least two architectural phases (Cl-Hel). Exploration of structure F began. Finds include residual Ar, as well as Cl and Hel pottery, terracotta figurines and 61 coins of Ambrakia. Two large rooms of another Ar-Hel house came to light at O.

Finds of LCl-Hel (4, 3 and 2 Cts BC) pottery (including a skyphos inscribed HPA), bronze and silver coins, terracotta figurines and stamped tiles provide the only dating evidence. Five Byz and PostByz graves were also found. Two further stretches of wall came to light at O. Vasileos Konstantinou. SW Cemetery. Of fourteen LCl-MHel graves (ten trench, four cist and two tile) at O. Kommenou 166 (Theodorou plot) some contained multiple inhumations and one a secondary cre- mation.

Further excavation of the funerary peribolos at O. Kommenou 242 (Dimou plot) yielded seven C1-Hel graves (two cist, five trench) and two funerary chests (or cenotaphs). Rich finds from cist grave 1 include 17 perfume flasks, 26 other ves- sels, five gold danakes, a bronze strigil, an iron spearhead and terracotta figurines.

Rescue excavation took place in three locations (ADelt, 538- 40). On the SE lower slopes of the Limnari hill, a badly dam- aged (Hel?) house was found; another similar structure was found on the SW slopes. At 200m NE of Agia Paraskevi, a small Hel rural shrine (ca 6m by 4m) yielded terracotta fig- urines of the 4-1 Ct BC, miniature vases (mikkyla angeia), bronze rivets, an iron dagger, an iron ring and a gold earring. Among the bronze coins were examples from Elea (4 Ct BC), the Epirot Alliance (end of 4 Ct BC), from Ambrakia (238-168 BC); among the silver were coins of Corinth (L4-E3 Ct) and a tetradrachm of Alexander the Great.

Surface finds indicate probably Pal tool pro- duction at Rogka and Arenda (ADelt, 545). Thasos. Large quantities of pottery and walls with concrete on the Igoumenitsa-Paramythia road indicate the probable site of the Rom colony of Photike (ADelt, 545). Egnatia Odos, Psilorachi/Agios Nikolaos-Krystallopigi section. Surface survey in advance of the construction of the Egnatia Odos has revealed nine principally MPal sites in the terra rossa, most close to the village of Eleftherochori, which have been excavated (ADelt, 542-45). Site 1 alone yielded ca 20,000 MPal, and Site 7 around 35,000 MPal flint cores, tools, flakes and debitage, many clearly Levalloisian. A similar pic- ture emerges from the other seven sites investigated. Egnatia Odos, Grika/Mesovouni section. Another MPal site found in the section between the Grika and Mesovouni tun- nels (ADelt, 542) yielded 509 flint objects. To the E, a Hel structure (farmstead?) at Grika, Litharia Monovyzas has been partially investigated (ADelt, 541-42). Demos Syvotton, Polyneri-Koutsi. Investigation of a probable funerary peribolos at Barda (Tsodolou field) yielded two com- plete (Hel?) vessels, a bronze coin and iron dagger (ADelt, 537). Demos Igoumenitsas, Ladochori Igoumenitsas. Excavations in seven locations have revealed more of this principally LRom-ECh settlement (ADelt, 527-37). Further excavation in the Barkaba plot revealed two complexes with several small rooms on either side of an alley/road. One has a cistern and possible circular bath. A destruction horizon yielded 140 bronze coins and two Rom lamps. At the Prokopi plot, border- ing the two Zoi plots (investigated in 1997), more rooms of the courtyard house were excavated, including a LRom mosaic in room 4. Several small rooms of a house in the Anastasiou plot yielded evidence of four hearths. Finds include glassware, plain (but large) pots, six bronze coins, a bronze ring and an iron dagger. Three small parallel rooms bordering a road came to light in the Revi plot. Finds include LRom and ECh pottery. Excavation of several more rooms of the structure in the Nanousi plot yielded (from room 1) transport amphorae, cook- ing wares, a marble lekanis and several tegulae mammatae. Finally a LRom bath complex was investigated in the Pappa plot. Structures include several semi-circular rooms with tegu- lae mammatae and a hypocaust, and finds include glassware and plain wares for storing liquids (amphorae etc). A marble column capital with a cross may indicate that this bath complex later became a church. Egnatia Odos, Graikochori. Five Rom tile graves were investigated at Amygdaleonas (ADelt, 542).

In Garitsa (area of anc. necropolis), at O. Theodorou Desylla 151 (Moraiti plot) nineteen Cl-Hel graves (five simple trench, seven tile, four tile/cist [including some cremations], two cremations and one clay structure) yielded a bronze mirror. Nearby was an Ar circular funerary peribolos, not yet fully investigated. At Parodos Alkinoou 15 (Georgara plot) three stratified levels indicating anc. harbour works were investigated, the second stratum yielding LCl-Hel (4-3 Ct BC) pottery. At Anemomylos, O. Emmanouel Theotoki (Arion hotel plot) investigation of a major Rom structure began. At Kanoni at the Argyrou plot, a Cl-Hel structure yielded black-glazed pottery, Corcyrean amphorae of the 5-3 Ct BC, a 5 Ct BC terracotta of a satyr, a bronze 'Illyrian' pin, bronze spearheads, transport amphora of Corcyrean type of the 5-3 Ct BC and coins of Corcyra and of Demetrios Poliorketes of the L4-E3 Ct. At O. Nausikas (Chalkiopoulou plot) a large struc- ture with several architectural phases, beginning in Ar times, was sealed by a destruction/collapse layer of the 1 Ct BC. Finds from this stratum include Laconian and Cor tiles, lamps, trans- port amphorae, and painted and plain pottery. Ar finds from the lowest stratum include pottery and a 'daedalic' female terracot- ta figurine. Other finds include 4-3 Ct BC coins of Kerkyra, Epiros and Kephallenia. At O.

Grevena, Pindos. N. Efstratiou, P. Biagi, P. Elefanti and M. Spataro (AEMTH 17 [2003], 581-89) discuss an intensive sur- vey in the mountainous area of Grevena in Pindos, aiming at investigation of the human presence in such an environment. In the area above 1.600m asl 27 mainly open-air PH sites were located, all near natural resources (e.g., lakes and flint sources). The sites date to the M-LPal and ENeo periods, according to the lithic artefacts. Kastri, Grevena. S. Drougou and C. Kallini (AEMTH 17 [2003], 591-96) report on the excavation in the anc. city, which revealed parts of a sanctuary (W naos, Doric stoa and main building), together with the surrounding wall of the acropolis and the city wall (2.70m w.). The latter had an impressive mon- umental NW gate. The name of the anc. city and the sanctuary remains unknown. Grevena Prefecture. G.A.

Mapping of roads and sites with var- ious defensive structures was undertaken. Investigation of the main routes in the area S and SW of the Grevena Prefecture located two important fortified settlements: Petra Ziani at Monahiti and Katafiyi Kallitheas. The Grevena Paleolithic Survey. Katerina Harvati (ASCSA/New York University/Max-Planck-Institut) and Eleni Panagopoulou (EPS) report on the 2004 season: 'The first of three seasons, in 2004, aimed to locate new Pal and palaeoanthropological/palaeontological sites. The purpose of this project is to help test hypotheses about the earliest colo- nization of the European continent by adding evidence from SE Europe. Greece lies on the hypothesized dispersal corridor from Africa through the Near East into Europe and is the gateway into the continent through which migrant populations have repeatedly passed. The region's fossil human and Pal records are therefore critical in addressing the earliest human forays into Europe. Nonetheless, Gr Pal archaeology and paleoan- thropology remain largely unexplored. The Grevena area holds exceptional promise for Pal and paleoanthro-pological research. Although it has not been systematically surveyed for this time period, the region has previously yielded Pal artefacts, includ- ing one of the two Lower Pal bifacial stone tools known from the country, and rich Pleistocene fauna. The present survey focuses on the terraces of the river Aliakmon, which preserve Upper Pliocene to Pleistocene fluvial sediments and a rich Pliocene and Pleistocene fauna. The team's geologists, Panagiotis Karkanas and Athanassios Athanassiou engaged on a geological survey to date more precisely these terraces and fau- nal remains locally, and in the wider Grevena-Kastoria basin. This ongoing work produces hypotheses on the geological his- tory of the area, and informs the survey proper in choosing its selection areas. Two fieldwalking teams systematically examined the longi- tudinal profiles of the terraces along the main course of the Aliakmon River, searching for lithic artefacts or fossil remains, concentrating on terrace slopes, gullies and tributary channels. The cultivated terrace surfaces received less attention, due to their low visibility. All finds were logged, recorded on GPS, photographed, etc. The area delimited W of Palaiokasto, E of Amygdalea, N of Grevena and along the river Aliakmon was the focus of the survey. Reconnaissance was also conducted in the wider Grevena-Kastoria basin during the preliminary geo- logical assessment, which located additional promising locali- ties. Our observations generally confirmed the existence of the system of five terraces at the levels proposed in the past, with small differences in elevation at local level. However, it became apparent that the dating of the individual terraces is much more complicated that originally proposed, due to the fact that most terraces are not depositional in nature but are instead erosional (strath terraces). Fortunately, isolated patches of Pleistocene fossiliferous depositional terraces are indeed pre- served in between the main erosional system. Two examples of such depositional terraces are the areas of Tsakoni (N of Tsakoni village) and of Kostarazi (Locality Lagoura, Neo Kostarazi,. The Tsakoni locality (30m terrace) yielded an elephant tusk of LPleistocene age. The Kostarazi locality (50m terrace) was known to have previously yielded a cervid metapodial, possibly Megaloceros, from unpublished data (report submitted to the EPS in 1999). During our survey this locality was found to be one of the most promising for future investigation. Several fossil remains were located, including proboscideans, an artiodactyle tibia and basicranium, possibly also Megaloceros, remains of equids and bovids, as well as a lithic artefact of MPal technology. A possible date of E to M Pleistocene was indicated. The sedimentary nature of most localities investigated showed long sequences of cross stratified pebble-rich layers and sandstone banks (probably bars and channels deposits) grading to a series of brownish or grey paleosols. While some of these localities appeared to be rela- tively rich in fossil specimens and lithics, many seemed sterile even after hours of thorough surveying. No dense accumula- tions of fossil or lithic material were noted. This is probably the result of the braided nature of the paleo-Aliakmon river, which indicates rapid and large fluctuations in river discharge and a non constant river channel, resulting in erratic deposition of material. Poor visibility due to very dense vegetation in the localities searched probably further complicated the recovery of additional specimens. Forty eight fossil specimens and 22 lithic artefacts were col- lected, both in situ and from the surface. A preliminary faunal list includes equids, bovids, cervids, proboscideans, rhinocerotids and canids, indicating for the most part a LPliocene-EPleistocene age. A precise assessment of the age of</page><page sequence="69">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 69 each locality has not been possible so far. The lithics collected were for the most part of LPleistocene age (MPal and LPal tech- nology), with a few possible earlier pieces. It should be noted that the coarse-grained nature of the raw material and the absence of comparative collections from Gr make the assess- ment of the technical features of these pieces quite difficult. We also had the opportunity to examine briefly unidentified faunal and lithic material kept at local museums or even village schools. Among these were elephant remains from Trapezitsa, a series of large bifacial tools curated at the Folk Museum of Kozani, some of which may represent Lower Pal artefacts, an unpublished Lower Pal biface curated at the Archaeological Museum ofAiani, and the handaxe collected and published by Higgs, now curated at the Archeological Museum of Kozani. Considerable effort was made to establish the provenance of these finds, sometimes collected decades ago, as well as possi- ble sources for their raw materials. Activities in the next few years will include the analysis of fos- sil fauna, more terrace survey, paleomagnetic study of sediments and study of material from the Kozani and Aiani museums.

Karamitrou-Mendessidi (ADelt, 666-67) reports on the excavation of ten burials. Apart from the bronze objects (jewellery and weapons), and two amber beads, grave goods include hand-made pottery, burnished and local matt-painted wares, with kantharoi as the most common vessel type, and four Myc vessels, two of which are local imitations. Building remains presumably belonging to a small-scale settlement were also located, dated by the pottery to the LH IIIA and B. Polymylos. G. Karamitrou-Mendessidi (ADelt, 667-71) notes rescue excavations which revealed remains dating from PH to the MByz period. In the N section of the excavated area, poor- ly preserved architectural remains (fragmentary walls, post- holes and floor relics) were revealed, dated by pottery to the MBA and LBA. Three LBA circular tombs with single or mul- tiple burials and hand-made vessels as offerings were also investigated. Just to the S, two Hel graves were excavated, accompanied by clay vessels. In the same area a funerary inscribed stele (AsEtpio) / Avrty6voi / ~lpcot) was found, dating to the 2 Ct BC. To the SE, three LHel/ERom rectangular pot- tery kilns, used in firing building materials, were investigated. In the S section two buildings were excavated, dated by coins and pottery to the 3-4 Ct AD. A funerary stele of a slave found built into a wall bore the inscription [too O]pjavvt, with the name Apiiiorv. Xirolimni, Porta. G. Karamitrou-Mendessidi (ADelt, 671-73) reports on the excavation of a PH settlement. A destruction layer of E-LNeo and E-MNeo post-framed dwellings suggests that the settlement was destroyed by fire. Burials and scattered human bones indicate the use of this area as a burial place in the LNeo. Deposits contained characteristic LNeo pottery: black- surfaced vessels and painted wares similar to the LNeo Servia ones. Other finds include, ground, polished and chipped stone tools, bone tools, clay bobbins, loom weights and spindle whorls, figurines and jewellery. A tomb with three burials was also investigated, one of them accompanied by an EBA vessel. Mesiani, Faragi. A. Chondrogianni (ADelt, 673-75) reports on the rescue excavation in the PH settlement, situated on the N coast of the Polifitos artificial lake. A series of storage and refuse pits, along with storage pithoid constructions (pits with plastered walls), were investigated. Pits contained LNeo, Final Neo and EBA pottery, animal bones, building material and var- ious small finds. An EBA pit burial was also investigated. Koilada, Toumba Kremastis-Koiladas. A. Chondrogianni (ADelt, 675-77) reports on the rescue excavation in the flat LNeo settlement extending around the LNeo mound investigat- ed in 1996. Two phases were identified. The first includes a series of circular refuse pits and part of a ditch, containing a large amount of pottery, animal and human bones, building material and small finds. The second phase is characterized by cremation burials in small vessels. Kitrini Limni-Koilada, Xeropigado. Ch. Ziota (ADelt, 677- 79) reports on further excavation in the PH cemetery where 42 undisturbed BA burials were investigated: periboloi with pit graves, cist graves and one enchytrismos in pithoid vessels. One or two vessels were usually placed by the head of the deceased. Other finds include jewels (two silver earrings and a perforated shell), spindle whorls and stone tools. The cemetery dates to the second half of the 3 mill. BC and was used for approximately 500 years. Study of human bones suggests that both sexes and all age groups, including children, participated in agricultural activities. The diet of the population appeared to be mainly protein based. N of the PH settlement a farmstead, along with a group of sixteen pit graves was excavated, dating to L5 or E6 Ct AD. Prefecture of Kozani. G. Karamitrou-Mendessidi (AEMTH 17 [2003], 553-69) reports on the excavations in the Perfecture of Kozani. In Servia four graves, dating to the 8-7 Ct BC were investigated, one of which yielded bronze jewellery and a ceramic kantharos as grave goods. In Rymnio an Ar burial was excavated, yielding seven clay vessels, a bronze phiale and an iron-shank fibula. In Metamorfossi, in the area of the Ar ceme- tery, fifteen burial pits were uncovered, already looted in antiq- uity, yielding a small number of sherds of Attic vessels dating to the second quarter of the 6 Ct BC. In Analipsi, a group of Hel pit graves was investigated. In Karyohori (Eordaia), two undisturbed graves of the 3 Ct BC were excavated in the anc. cemetery.

NOMos OF PELLA (17 EPCA; 11 EBA) Pella. M. Lilibaki-Akamati (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 640-41) reports on excavation in the area of the new entrance to the archaeological site. A public bath and a workshop area with pottery kilns and storage rooms (large pithoi in situ) were uncovered. The remains have three constructional phases, the latest of which dates to the second half of the 2 Ct BC (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 59). P. Chrysostomou reports (ADelt, 640-48) on excavations in the buildings I, III, V, VIa and VIb of the palace. In building I, two rooms and the propylon were investigated, along with deposits to the W and E containing architectural features and large quantities of Hel pottery. In the courtyard the foundations of a semi-circular stand and the foundation of the stylobate of the E stoa were revealed. In building V, the well of the S stoa of the palaistra was investigated (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 59). The latter was connected with another well through a tunnel. In building III, room F with a destruction layer of Cor tiles was excavated, along with corridor L3, which appears to have a drainage conduit. In building VIa, nine rooms and the corridor were investigated (rooms Al, A2, B-H). The type and the posi- tion of this building, next to the palaistra, lead to the assump- tion that it served as a dormitory (4evdov) for the 'royal youth'. In building VIb were five rooms (Al, A2, B-D) with floors cov- ered with destruction layers containing Cor tiles. N of building VIb, part of the wall was uncovered, along with a rectangular tower. Between the wall and the baths seven rooms were uncovered; probably apartments of the palace guard (stratonas). G. Akamatis (AEMTH 17 [2003], 485-96) reports on inves- tigation in the NE wing of the anc. agora. The foundation of the NE comer of the N stoa was revealed. Two constructional phases of the stoa were identified in the interior of double rooms, one dated to the 4 and the other to the 2 Ct BC. Other finds in the area suggest the existence of an earlier cemetery. In the area N of the NE access to the agora an entrance and a drainage tiled conduit ending in a small rectangular stone well were investigated. The destruction layer of the double rooms of the E stoa was also excavated, yielding a large number of finds including figurines and moulds. Further excavation of the road on the S boundary of the agora brought to light a variety of finds dated to the 3-1 Ct BC: 250 stamped amphora handles from dif- ferent parts of the Aegean, ivory, bone and bronze objects, gold jewellery, faience and glass pendants, glass vessels, relief plaques, numerous figurines, ceramic vessels (e.g,. sherds of rf craters, lids of lekanis, a panathenaic amphora) and fragmented statues (figure sitting on a rock, torso of a female figure). M. Lilibaki-Akamati [AEMTH 17 [2003], 465-84) reports on a rescue excavation in the area of Facos, which was in antiqui- ty an islet in the lagoon. According to anc. sources the islet was linked to the city by a timber bridge. LNeo, BA and IA build- ings, dated by pottery, were uncovered. Also, a building of the 4 Ct BC and workshops dated to the L2 and first half of the 1 Cts BC were found. Pottery of the 5 Ct BC suggests that the area was inhabited in the Cl period. Among the most interest- ing finds is a cylindrical marble pedestal with the inscription AYAOX FIKTQPIOY FAIOY, O EHIKAAOYENOX, AAEEAN- APOB EPMEI, AFOPAII XAPIETHPION, dated to the L2-E1 Ct BC, which represents the earliest epigraphical evidence of the cult of Hermes Agoraos at Pella. Archontiko Giannitson. P. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 648-50) refers to the Heroon of Archondiko, a tomb with a stone cir- cular krepis (50m d.) dated to the EHel period (285-281 BC). In the upper part of the krepis was a relief of Macedonian shields. A. Chrysostomou and P. Chrysostomou (AEMTH 17 [2003 ] 505-16) report on rescue excavations in the W necropolis of the anc. settlement (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 59; AR 50 [2003- 2004], 44), where 70 mostly plundered graves were investigat- ed. The fourteen IA pit and cist graves were poorly furnished. Cl and EHel burials (32) mainly pit and tile graves, were accompanied by bronze coins, silver, bronze and iron jewellery, weaponry and vessels, along with ceramic vessels and terracot- ta figurines. A group of Ar noble family pit graves was also investigated: eleven male, eight female and two unidentified burials, all rich in offerings (see also Kathimerini, 13/2/2005). Noticeable is the grave of a female (T 262), dating to 510-500 BC, with exceptionally rich offerings (jewellery and metal objects). The head of the deceased was decorated with gold, glass and amber beads, the forehead with a gold diadem, the face was covered with a gold mask, the neck with a gold neck- lace, the hand with a gold bracelet and the area of the chest with three pairs of gold and silver pins. Clothes and shoes were dec- orated with gold bands. Other finds include iron knives, bronze vessels (a lekanis, an oinochoe, two lebes, ten phialae), two ceramic vessels (Cor exaleiptron, droop type kylix), six female figurines, a bronze miniature vessel and an iron model of a car- riage. Three monumental warrior burials were also investigat- ed. Rich in offerings was T 279, dating to the second half of the 6 Ct BC, where iron weapons (sword, spears and knives), a bronze Illyrian helmet decorated with gold bands, a bronze shield of 'Argeitian' type, a gold mask, gold bracelets, pins and cloth decorative bands, a silver phiale, eleven bronze sympo- sium vessels (a Cor lebes, an oinochoe, a strainer, an exaleip- tron and seven phialae), four ceramic vessels (a black-glazed lekythos, a Cor exaleiptron, an attic plemochoe and an attic bf Siana kyliks depicting a battle), terracotta figurines, models of a carriage and of furniture, and various utensils were found.

Agrosykia, Protomagia. P. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 651-53) notes the rescue excavation of a twin cist grave, covered by a low mound. The inner walls of the graves were decorated with coloured plaster. Grave A was looted and only some traces of a gold wreath were found. In grave B pieces of gold wreaths were found scattered, but in the middle of the grave an iron nail, a stater and an intact myrtle wreath indicate that they were prob- ably placed with the charred bones in a wooden cist. The graves date to the third quarter of the 4 Ct BC. Pentaplatanos. P. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 653-54) reports on rescue excavations in a defensive ditch (3m w., 35m 1.), dated to the EHel period. Remains of a mud-brick wall were found in the ditch, along with BA, IA, Ar, C1 and Hel pottery.</page><page sequence="71">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 71 Giannitsa B. P. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 654-55) reports on res- cue excavations in the area of the PH settlement (Parisi plot) (see AR 50 [2003-04], 43). Under the LNeo, ENeo deposits with three distinctive construction phases were investigated. In the latest, the floors of two dwellings, along with the foundation ditches of their walls were uncovered. In the second phase, dated by the pottery to 6300-6200 BC, a post-framed dwelling with three additional rooms, its floor covered with a destruction layer, was investigated. In the interior of the dwelling, various structures were found. Apart from pottery, the finds include 120 clay sling bullets, stone and bone tools, ceramic and stone beads and an intact female figurine. Outside the building two infant burials were placed in a shallow pit. The floor of a similar dwelling from the earliest ENeo phase was investigated. C14 dates place this phase in the M7 mill. BC. Agras, Edessa. A. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 655) notes rescue excavations in the area of the primary school. Part of the IA cemetery with 50 cist graves was investigated. Vessels, spindle whorls and beads, metal jewellery and weapons accompanied the burials. Drosia. A. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 656-57) reports on rescue excavations in A. Kehagioglou plot, where PH deposits (possi- bly part of the Neo settlement), a PH tomb and part of a cobbled road were investigated. In the NW of the plot remains of a Rom building were uncovered. Skydra. A. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 657) notes the rescue exca- vations in a building plot of the council estate (Epyact EKg KarotlKFg), where a Hel temple (28.5m byl0.5m) was built on BA deposits. Konstantia. A. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 658) notes the investi- gation of a rectangular stone grave (tomb 17) during cleaning works in the cemetery. The offerings include ceramic vessels and jewellery. To the E there was a dromos leading to the entrance of the tomb. NoMos OF IMATHIA (18 EPCA; 11 EBA) Veroia. L. Stefani (ADelt, 659) and Agelioforos (23/1/2005) note that during the rescue excavations in O. Venizelou part of a paved Rom road, one of the two main roads of the Rom city, was investigated. In O. Akatamahitou, part of a Rom street was uncovered. M. Apostolou reports (ADelt, 659-61) on the excavations of three Hel graves in O. Alamanas. Grave I had two chambers and was found plundered. Grave II was a single vaulted cham- ber. Pieces of decorated plaster suggest that the whole surface of the grave was decorated. Grave goods include ceramic ves- sels (pyxis, lebes, pinakia, skyphoi), a bronze phiale and bracelet. In grave III, also a single vaulted chamber, four buri- als (three on klinai and one in the corridor) were accompanied by rich offerings: ceramic vessels (pyxis, oinochoae, skyphoi, amphorae, olpe, inkpot, arytenae), lamps and terracotta fig- urines, metal vessels and jewellery (bronze clasp, gold ear- rings), iron strigils and coins. In O. Stadiou 39 a Hel grave with a single vaulted chamber was investigated. It had three klinai, and contained ceramic vessels (perfume flasks, pyxis, inkpot, skyphoi), terracotta figurines and lumps, iron nails, bronze coins, a glass bead and a small glass amphora. In O. Epirou and Abderon four graves (two tile and two cist) of the LRom peri- od were investigated. Five inscribed marble funerary stelae were collected. Vergina. A. Kottaridou reports (ADelt, 661-62) on the rescue excavations in the anc. necropolis. Pit and tile graves, dating to the Hel and EImperial periods, were excavated at the S and W ends of the necropolis, and in the area of the Bella tomb. Also, 31 pit graves were investigated in the area S of the royal tombs of the great mound. Most of them date to the L5-E4 Ct BC, and only two to the reign of Phillip II. Inhumations predominate, with two cases of cremations. Offerings include ceramic ves- sels (attic black-glazed and rf skyphoi, oinochoe, lekythia, alabasters, askoi), metal vessels (kylix, lekanis, phialae), silver, bronze and gold jewellery (earrings, bracelets, rings, clasps, pins, beads). Between the Bella and the Heuzey tomb, LHel tumuli (2-1 Ct BC) contained burial pyrai and cists with urns. N of the Heuzey tomb a poorly furnished Imperial cist grave with six inhumations was investigated. It was built with mate- rial from the earliest graves. S. Drougou (AEMTH 17 [2003], 533-38) discusses the study of pottery from the great mound. A new volume on Vergina is published: X. tr'G67ov- hXata6~Xi, Bepyivx, o tzdqog o; o tuh nou -1 r otoioypOcpi 9e to I(cvilyt, (Archaeological Society at Athens, Athens, 2004). Makedonis municipality. A. Kottaridou (Ethnos 21/9/2004) discusses the excavation of 22 burials in the Ar cemetery. The graves were rich in offerings: jewellery, metal and ceramic ves- sels (local and Attic). An Attic krater, depicting a battle, is dated to 540-530 BC. There is an ongoing discussion concerning the identification of the site of Vergina as anc. Aiges and the grave of 'Phillip II'. P. Faklaris and 0. Pallagia believe that it is later and therefore does not belong to Phillip II. P. Faklaris also suggests that Vergina is not the capital of the Macedonian kingdom and places Aiges in the area of mount Vermion (To Vima, Ethnos, Eleutherotypia 9/2/2005, Ta Nea 28/3/2005, H Apofasi 29/3/2005). A. Kottaridou, on the basis of the evidence from the recent excavation in Vergina, supports the opposite (To Vima, Ethnos, Eleutherotypia 9/2/2005). Naousa, Kopanos. M. Apostolou (ADelt, 663) notes the rescue excavation of three cist graves. One of them contained a twin burial, accompanied by bronze jewellery and ceramic vessels. Leukadia. L. Stefani (ADelt, 663-64) reports on restoration work and investigations undertaken in the grave known as &lt;&lt;Tmqpo;g trig PocOa;&gt;&gt;. The grave anteroom deposit contained human (four adults and a child) and animal bones along with a few Rom sherds. Pieces of plaster with characteristic deep blue and red colour suggest that the grave had painted decoration. Also, a fragmentary marble inscription with information on the economic and administrative organization of the anc. city was recovered. The bottom of the grave yielded a series of finds: a group of iron weapons (four spearheads), ivory decorative pieces belonging to a kline and of a wooden box, gold threads and pieces of a wreath, a large spear of a sarisa, iron sheets with leather and gold remains, probably pieces of a shield, as well as a Thasian amphora with a stamped handle which dates the grave to 300 BC. Near the &lt;&lt;Tdqog ring xpieor;&gt;&gt; another Macedonian grave (L4E3 Ct BC) was investigated. It has a double chamber with vaulted roof, and a facade with Ionic architectural features. It was looted. The few remaining finds (ceramic vessels, a jewel case decorated with shells, gold beads of a necklace) indicate a female burial (To Vima 12/2/2005). Toumba Angelohoriou. L.

On the top of the mound a destruction horizon cover- ing floors of unidentified buildings was investigated. The destruction layer was rich in charcoal and yielded large quanti- ties of pottery: matt-painted and incised table ware, and large storage vessels. Other finds include stone and bone tools, loom weights and spindle whorls. Toumba Polyplatanou. L. Stefani reports (ADelt, 665) on fur- ther excavation in the PH settlement (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 61). Large buildings with several constructional phases and other architectural features (pits, clay walls) were investigated. All are dated by Dimini ware to the last phase of the LNeo. Other finds include bone and stone tools, loom weights and spindle whorls, figurines, sling bullets, bobbins, stone beads and perforated shells, along with large quantities of pottery. The most characteristic decorated types of pottery were Dimini and 'black on red' painted ware. Kipseli, Alexandria. M. Apostolou reports (ADelt, 664-65) on the excavation in the area of the Hel city (P. Triantafyllidi plot). Buildings with two constructional phases, dating to the 4 and 2 Cts BC were revealed. Finds include vessels, figurines, stamped handles, coins, and bronze and iron objects. CENTRAL MACEDONIA NOMOS OF KILKIS (16 EPCA; 9 EBA) Europos. Th. Savvopoulou (ADelt, 586) reports on the exca- vation in the area of the vaulted chamber graves, where 100 poorly furnished pit and tile graves were investigated. Grave goods include a small number of vessels, while metal jewellery was rare. In Doulkeridis plot a vaulted chamber grave with five adult and two child burials was excavated. The entrance to the grave was sealed with a Rom funerary stele. Grave goods included four clay lumps and a pointed pithos. The area seems to have been inhabited in LPH, as suggested by IA pottery. Kilkis. D. Igantiadou, E. Dotsika, A. Kouras, Y. Maniatis (AEMTH 17 [2003], 311-12) report on their research concern- ing Nitrum Chalestricum, the natron of Macedonia. Scientific analysis of the samples from Pikrolimni lake confirmed the assumption that this lake was the source of anc. natron. NOMOS OF THESSALONIKE (16 EPCA; 9 EBA) Thessalonike. N. Fintikakis et al. (AEMTH 17 [2003], 255- 62), X. Giannakis and I. Niaouris (AEMTH 17 [2003], 265-73) report on the renovation of the Archaeological Museum. D. Grammenos (AEMTH 17 [2003], 263-64) notes a series of new exhibitions to be open by autumn 2005. One of these, 'The Gold of Macedon', already open in the building's renovated part, focuses on the technology, the use and the role of golden objects in anc. Macedonian burial customs. Among the exhibits are the famous Derveni krater (330-320 BC) and Derveni papyrus (350-320 BC), the oldest papyrus in Gr (Eleftherotypia 22/7/2004). A publication on the history of the museum by D. Grammenos is now available: To ApXxtohoytK6 MotxEsio OEJoahoviKc1 (Olkos, Athens, 2004). Kathimerini (3/12/2004) comments on the book and notes the new exhibitions in the ren- ovated museum. Exhibits of the museum, and of the other Macedonian museums (Vergina, Dion, Pella, etc.), enriched the exhibition on the 'World of Alexander the Great' in the Onasseion Cultural Centre, New York (Ethnos 4/1/2005). Western environs of Thessalonike Nea Eukarpia. E. Labrothanasi (ADelt, 577) notes the rescue excavation in O. Themeli and 28 October, where 81 IA pit graves were investigated.

Nea Philadelpheia. V. Misailidou-Despotidou (ADelt, 577- 80) reports on rescue excavation in the IA settlement and ceme- tery. The area E and SE of the large four-room building was investigated. A thick wall, stone structures and an oven used for outdoor food preparation were revealed, along with a midden. The remains of an earlier building were also recovered. In the cemetery 1,101 burials were investigated: pit and cist graves, enchytrismoi in pithoi and cremations in urns. Offerings include ceramic vessels (cups, phialae, prohoi), bronze and iron jewellery (clasps, pins, pendants, beads, bracelets, rings) and tools (iron knives, clay loom weights and spindle whorls). One cist grave contained three burials: an inhumation and two cre- mations (one in an urn and the other in a decorated wooden cist). Grave goods include a gold female head pendant on a gold chain and a gold earring in the shape of Eros. Thessalonike (centre) Ancient agora. P. Adam-Veleni reports (ADelt, 549-54) on fur- ther excavations in the agora. In the area of the Valaneio, the rec- tangular room interpreted as a 'tavern' was further excavated. The destruction layer of the second storey was rich in organic material and Rom pottery, along with fragments of decorated plastered walls, while the mosaic floor of the ground floor was rich in everyday vessels used for preparing meals. Other finds were similar in both layers: clay lumps in various shapes and sizes with relief decoration, glass vessels, cooking pots, pans, ladles and plates, skyphoi, lekanides, oinochoe, amphorae, ter- racotta figurines and theatrical masks, along with considerable amounts of animal bones and shells. Investigation of the earli- er layers suggests that the Valaneion was placed upon an EHel phase destroyed by fire. In the area S of the agora, a Hel destruction layer of the 2 and 1 Cts BC with pits, postholes and ditches was investigated. In the area of the 'Rom road' (section L), a Hel floor with two walls was found above a pit containing burnt debris with good quality pottery ('W slope' skyphoi and kantharoi, black- glazed skyphoi, roulleting pinakia, kantharoi with fluted deco- ration and an inkpot), dating to the L4-3 and E2 Ct BC. Excavation in the area of the 'commercial road' revealed water conduits, while in the area of the 'square' investigation focused on the workshop pits and post-framed structures dated to LHel- ERom times. The pits contained pottery, coinage, lumps, fig- urines, metal objects, animal bones and shells. An amber cameo depicting a libation scene was also recovered. In the W side of the Agora, a 2 Ct AD spring house was recovered, built with material of a 3 Ct BC Macedonian tomb (Eleutherotypia, To Vima, 12/2/2005).</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 73 Palace of Galerius. M. Karaberi reports (AEMTH 17 [2003], 227-32; ADelt, 554-55) on the excavation of the exten- sive Hel coastal commercial centre found beneath the Galerius palace complex, dated to the 4 Ct BC-i Ct AD. LHel work- shops have been excavated under the Galerian mosaics in the N stoa of the palace (a metallurgy workshop and a kiln for pro- ducing moulds for casting metal objects); workshops for the pottery, metallurgy and dye-work in the area between the Octagon and the Nymphaion, and a pottery kiln adjacent to the S stoa of the palace above which the mosaic floor of a Rom villa was found. All the workshops were in use from the 2 Ct BC to the 1 Ct AD. Finds, such as pottery ('W slope' ware and stamped Rhodian, Knidian and Thasian amphorae) and coins, indicate an earlier habitation phase dating to the 4-2 Ct BC. In the 1 Ct AD the workshop area was converted into a residential one as the remains of luxurious Rom villas suggests. Parts of these villas (marble-incrusted floors, mosaics, frescoes) have also been uncovered under the Galerian mosaics in the S stoa of the palace. This Rom phase was destroyed by fire in the mid-3 Ct AD. E. Trakosopoulou (ADelt, 555-56) notes the excavation of 408 graves in the broader area of the Hel-Rom E cemetery of Thessalonike (International Fair of Thessalonike, N entrance), dated to the E3 Ct BC-4 Ct AD. Cist and tile graves with inhu- mations are common, while cremation is quite rare. A small number of pit graves belong to the Hel period (E3 Ct BC to the Elmperial period). Several graves were covered with stone altars, often with libation conduits. Two LRom vaulted graves were also investigated, one of which had a mosaic floor. Another funeral monument of the L2-E3 Ct AD sheltered a tile grave and two urns. Grave goods include red-painted vessels, perfume flasks, cups, oinochoe, skyphoi, clay lumps, glass ves- sels, jewellery and bronze coins. In the same area the excava- tion also revealed an EHel road and workshop with numerous identical animal figurines, dated to the 1 Ct AD. M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti (ADelt, 556-58) reports on rescue excavation in the broader area of the E cemetery of Thessalonike (0. Melenikou 22, M), where 114 graves were investigated, dating to L1-L2 Ct AD. Pit, tile, cist graves and enchytrismoi, containing mainly cremations, but also inhuma- tions, were accompanied by a few offerings such as perfume flasks, clay lumps and figurines, iron and bronze jewellery, bone pins, glass vessels and bronze coins. Some graves were covered with stone altars, often with libation conduits. Noteworthy is a hoard of 44 coins dating to the Imperial period. M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti and A. Kaiafa (AEMTH 17 [2003], 233-44) report on the rescue excavation (at O. Melenikou 20) in a plot just inside the E wall of anc. Thessalonike, in the broad- er area of the E cemetery. Burials (78) of various types were investigated, mostly tile and cist graves, dating to the 1 and 2 Cts AD. Only a few of them contained offerings. A lead coffin (Fig. 120) was uncovered, the second of this type found in the cemeteries of Thessalonike. There were also six cases of 'plas- ter burials': pieces of gypsum with traces of cloth on them implied that the deceased were buried wrapped in shrouds and covered by this material, probably in an attempt to preserve their bodies. M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti (ADelt, 558) notes the excavation of 12 pit and tile graves at O. Agiou Dimitriou 198, dated to the LC1-EHel period. Byzantine Thessalonike A.

An extensive destruction layer, dated by coins to the M3 Ct AD, covered the rooms, two of which were associated with food pro- cessing and storage (pointed amphorae and pithoi were found in situ). A stone structure with traces of fire in a semi-roofed room was interpreted as a kiln. The main construction phase of the house dates to the first half of the 3 Ct AD. Apart from the large quantity of every-day pottery, a small number of sherds of red- painted vessels and lumps were found. Other finds include bone spoons, needles, pins and pens, clay loom weights and bobbins, metal bells, beads and one key. K. Soueref reports (AEMTH 17 [2003], 245-54) on rescue excavations in O.

Another room, with a quern, was associated with food preparation, and a stor- age room with pithoi and amphorae was also identified. Two further rooms of unidentified function contained two hoards buried in small pits: the first had three silver coins of Phillip II and the second four unidentified bronze coins. In the Alana of Toumba 111 graves were investigated, dat- ing to the L6-E3 Ct BC. Most of them were pit burials, with the exception of one sarcophagus and one grave constructed with plinths (Xtv0O6K'TctTg ¶cuqpog) containing traces of a wooden kline. Many graves were rich in offerings. The 6 Ct BC buri- als are accompanied by Cor vessels.

In the excavated area, there was a consider- able quantity of local and imported pottery spanning from the 9- 5 Ct BC, with the majority dating to the Ar period. S. Valamoti (AEMTH 17 [2003], 201-04) reports on the study of archaeobotanical remains. Grape pips and rape sug- gest the production of wine in the settlement. D. Tsiafaki (AEMTH 17 [2003], 205-12) reports on the data- base for the processing of the excavation material, designed in collaboration with the Institute for Cultural and Educational Technology in Xanthe. Gona. E. Skarlatidou and E. Konstantinidou (AEMTH 17 [2003], 213-26) discuss the rescue excavation in the flat (trapeza) settlement, which developed around the BA mound. Traces of the first inhabitation on trapeza date at least as early as the 9 Ct BC. The settlement was inhabited until the Rom period. The pottery of the earliest phases (9-first half of 7 Ct BC) include a large amount of local hand-made wares, a small number of wheel-made painted and imported (mainly from Euboea) vessels and local painted wares imitating the imported ones. In the second half of the 7 and E6 Cts local painted ware with Ionian influence predominates. The later phases were rep- resented by black-glazed sherds and other pottery of the 4 Ct BC and the EHel period, while terra sigillata wares belong to the Rom period. Thermi. E. Skarlatidou (ADelt, 567-73) reports on rescue excavations in plots in the broader area of the anc. cemetery. In O. Th. Litsa 26 LIA-Ar (6 Ct BC) graves were investigated; mainly pit graves and some enchytrismoi in pithoi. There were two pit graves in O. Pontou. In O. Makedonias and Irinis 170 Ar, C1 and Rom graves were investigated. The burial practices include inhumations and cremations in pit and cist graves. In O. M. Alexandrou inhumations in three pit graves and one cist grave were investigated. The latter included a female burial accompanied by black-painted and red-painted vessels and a bronze bracelet, dating to the 4 Ct BC. In two pit graves the deceased had wreaths with gilt bronze leaves and clay fruits, dated by coins to the L4-E 3 Ct BC. In O. Seferi nine graves were excavated: Ar cist graves, enchytrismoi in pithoi and pit graves. One of the pit graves contained a male burial, accom- panied by bronze and gold jewellery, glass and ceramic vessels, dating to the E3 Ct BC. In O. Karaoli-Dimitriou and Iasonidou two pit graves and an enchytrismos in a pithos were investigat- ed. In O. Makriyanni an enchytrismos in a pithos, included a L6 Ct BC female burial, accompanied by local phialae, a bronze and an amber bead. In O. Papanastasiou four graves were investigated: one LAr sarcophagus with a male burial contained attic bf vessels and iron weaponry. The other LAr sarcophagus had a female burial, accompanied by bronze and silver jew- ellery and an Attic rf skyphos. The cist grave contained a male burial, accompanied by an iron sword, while the pit grave had a female burial, accompanied by an iron knife. Byz Thermi. E. Doulkeri (ADelt, 627) reports on the inves- tigation of a cistern of the Byz period, found full of ceramics, most of them glazed. She also records (ADelt, 627-28) the route of the water-conduits system which is dated LRom-ECh. V. Allamani (ADelt, 571-73) reports on a rescue excavation in O. Heroon Polytehneiou where 67 graves were investigated. The 7 Ct BC burials are characterized by pit graves, usually accompanied by vessels, iron weaponry and bronze jewellery. The Ar burials were in pit and cist graves and sarcophagi and are accompanied by Attic and Cor vessels, along with local imi- tations. The same types of graves were in use in the 5 and 4 Cts BC, when imported Attic vessels predominate. The L4-E3 Ct .C burials were in pit graves, accompanied by black-glazed Attic pottery and bronze coinage. Plagiari - Fener Toumba. K. Soueref (ADelt, 574) notes a rescue excavation in Filotheou plot. Part of the LBA-EIA settle- ment was investigated by trial trenches, and two pit graves were thoroughly investigated. Offerings include bronze jewellery (beads, a necklace, a bracelet, earrings) and pottery fragments. Mesimeri. V. Misailidou-Despotidou (ADelt, 574) reports on the rescue excavation in P. Avramidou plot, where three</page><page sequence="76">76 JAMES WHITLEY looted graves (two pit graves and a cist grave) were found. In I. Avramidi-E. Marmaridou plot, six looted Ar-ECl cist graves were excavated. Finds include a gold pendant, a silver ring and two iron knives with bone handles. In I. Vasileiadi plot, three walls of a rectangular building were recovered with a deposit containing Hel and later pottery. Western suburbs of Thessalonike Polichni. A. Lioutas (ADelt, 575) notes the rescue excavation in O. Navarinou, E of the EIA-LCl Lembet settlement (trapeza). There were 67 Ar-Cl graves: pit and cist graves, enchytrismoi and sarcophagi. Most of the grave goods were pottery (black-glazed skyphoi, aryballoid lekythia, kantharoi, pyxides, kyathia, oinochoe, kylikes, lekythoi and Cor exaleip- tra), but also a female protome preserving some paint, animal and human figurines, bronze, silver and gold jewellery, weaponry (spearheads, knives, helmets) and coinage. Stavroupoli. A. Lioutas (ADelt, 575) reports on rescue excavations in O. Velissariou in the broader area of the IA cemetery. Pit and cist IA graves, 26 in all, were investigated, with ceramic vessels and bronze jewellery. Three Hel crema- tions in cist graves were also excavated: one had remains of kline with gilt clay decoration, gilt bronze wreaths, a lead pyxis, glass pessoi of a toy, bronze tube beads, nails and strigils. D. Grammenos and S. Kotsos (ADelt, 576) report on the res- cue excavations in three plots in the area of the Neo settlement. In O. Dagli 12 five pits were investigated. Two of them were dwellings, as clay floor and hearth remains suggest. The other two were probably refuse pits. Remains of two more hearths were recovered in the plot: one was post-framed, while the other was not sheltered. LNeo pottery is represented by cw, black and brown polished wares, red-surfaced and black-sur- faced vessels, rippled, barbotine and black on red ware. Other finds include chipped and polished stone tools, bone tools, spin- dle whorls, loom weights, figurines, etc. In O. Oraiokastrou 104 three phases of the settlement were investigated. The ear- lier phase is represented by a pit and the remains of a hearth, the second by another pit with remains of a floor and a hearth, the third phase by a ditch. Finds are similar to those from the above-mentioned plot. In O. Oraiokastrou 122 small and shal- low pits, probably used as refuse pits, were found. A second volume on the rescue excavations at the M-LNeo settlement of Stavroupoli is now available: D. Grammenos and S. Kotsos, (cootrlK AvaoKacxp;g oo NeoXt0t:6c OtCtop6 zatopo1nrtoXrlg OooEXoviK;, pgpog II (1998-2003) (Publications of the Archaeological Institute of Northern Greece 6, Thessalonike, 2004). A. Lioutas (H Kathimerini 16/2/2005) notes the rich fur- nished 4 Ct BC cist grave in O. Langada. The grave belonged to a 10-15 year old girl, apparently a member of a rich family. Grave goods include toys (26 bone astragaloi), three Attic ves- sels, a gold necklace, earrings and a ring, leaves of a gilt bronze wreath, beads of a gilt terracotta necklace and bronze coins. A. Lioutas, M. Mandaki and E. Iliopoulou (AEMTH 17 [2003], 299-310) report on rescue excavations in the area of the 6-L4 Ct BC cemetery related to the settlement (trapeza) of Lembet. In total 335 graves were investigated: most of them pit graves, but also cist graves and sarcophagi. Offerings include large number of vessels (Attic black-glazed skyphoi, kantharoi and aryballoid lykethia), terracotta figurines, lamps, spindle whorls, loom weights, metal objects (bronze, iron, sil- ver and gold jewellery, weaponry, coinage) and bone, glass and stone objects. A hoard of 88 coins of Kassander (316-306 BC) was found in one pit grave. Langadas basin Liti, Derveni. K. Tzanavari (ADelt, 580) discusses the excava- tion of a monumental grave, lkm NE of the well-known cist graves of Derveni. The funeral monument, comprised of a dro- mos, rectangular anteroom and circular room decorated with painted plaster, was looted and destroyed. A limestone epistep- sis, decorated with relief and painted floral motifs, is the only feature from the upper part of the structure. Within the monu- ment, a stone cist containing an urn was found, with a few ceramic vessels and terracotta female protomes. The grave is dated by a coin of Kassander to the E3 Ct BC. K. Tzanavari and K. Filis (AEMTH 17 [2003], 155-72) report on the excavation in the anc. city of Liti, where a mid- den, dated to the 5 Ct BC by pointed amphorae (mainly from Mende and Corinth), was excavated. Remains of Hel houses were also investigated: rooms, storage areas and a small pottery kiln. From the same period is part of the fortification wall found at the N end of the city, constructed with large stones. Building material (lime mortar) found in the excavated area suggests that in Rom times the city extended to this area as well. To the Rom period belong several cisterns and many circular pits for collecting water, along with a built pipe and a kiln. That the area was inhabited continuously from the 3 Ct BC to the 6 Ct AD is also confirmed by investigations in the city's cemetery. Assiros. M. Newton, K.A. Wardle and P.I. Kuniholm (AEMTH 17 [2003], 173-90) discuss dendrochronology and radiocarbon determinations of the beginning of the ProtoGeo in Assiros. Kalamoto, anc. Kalindoia. K. Sismanidis (AEMTH 17 [2003], 143-54) reports on the excavation of a Rom public building, with four rectangular stone bases (Fig. 124) and a 10m long pedestal constructed of huge marble slabs on which statues must had been placed. This is supported by the marble pedestal of a bronze statue bearing the inscription AYTOKPATOPA OEON OEOY YION TPAIANON/ XEBAXTON H HOAIX, and by a large number of fragments of marble statues of emperors and a very fine head of Athena-Minerva (Fig. 125) with a Cor hel- met (see also AR 50 [2003-2004], 51). These finds suggest that the building was a Sebasteion or temple, dating between the L1 Ct BC and the M3 Ct AD. Approximately 500 fragments of architectural features, stat- ues and inscriptions were found destroyed in an adjacent Byz lime kiln. Among them were the intact head and parts of the body of a more than life-sized statue of Octavianus Augustus, presumably originally placed on a pedestal in the middle of the temple. There was also a female marble head, identified by an inscription as Flavia Mista, dating to 86 AD. The text of the inscription informs us that Flavia and her son Eisidoros erected the temple for their fellow-citizens (Makedonia 7/8/2005, H Kathimerini 8/2/2005, 10/2/2005). Drymos. A. Keramaris (ADelt, 580) notes the rescue exca- vation in E. Tzoutzouri-G. Touridi plot, where two cist and three pit graves of the 5-4 Ct BC were investigated. Modios, anc. Arethousa. S. Lioutas (ADelt, 581) reports on the rescue excavation in the Hel-Rom cemetery of the anc. city, where fifteen tile graves were investigated, accompanied by perfume flasks, figurines, protomes, a bronze ring and a strigil, and bronze and silver coins. Stefanina. P. Adam-Veleni and I. Zografou (AEMTH 17 [2003], 127-38) report on the investigation of two large build- ings of the MImperial period, found above Hel deposits. The first complex represents a bath (thermae) dated to the 2 Ct AD, with caldarium (possibly only for dry heat), a praefurnium, a tepidarium (two large rooms) and a frigidarium (one room) with a marble basin in the centre. There were two piscinas next to the frigidarium. Above the remains of the bath a new building</page><page sequence="77">124 Kalamoto: Rom marble statue bases ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 77 of unidentified function was erected in the 3 Ct AD. Numismatic evidence suggests that it was destroyed in the 4 Ct. Both buildings belong to a walled settlement that flourished in the 2 and 3 Cts AD. K. Vouvalidis, G. Syrides and K. Albanakis (AEMTH 17 [2003], 313-22) report on the geological changes in the area of the Gulf of Thessalonike, due to the Holocene sea level rise in the last 10,000 years. NOMos OF PIERIA (16 EPCA; 9 EBA) Dion. D. Pantermalis (AEMTH 17 [2003], 417-24) reports on the discovery and investigation of the Sanctuary of Zeus Ipsistos (Jupiter Optimus Maximus) by the riverbank of the Vafiras. The temple of Zeus, oriented to the S, dominates the area. It had a stylobate on three sides and a single-room cella paved with mosaics. One of the most impressive finds is a mar- ble statue of Zeus dating to the Imperial period (Fig. 126): the god is sitting on a throne holding a sceptre in his raised left hand and a thunderbolt in his right. Various architectural features, some of them decorated with relief eagles, several marble inscriptions, vessels used in sacrifices and a bucranium were found. Two marble inscriptions are noteworthy. The first, dated to 251/252 AD, cites the names of the people responsible for the temple (each name corresponds to one month of the Macedonian calendar) (see also AR 50 [2003-2004], 53), while the second contains the list of worshipers and refers to land belonging to the sanctuary. The altar of the sanctuary is located outside the temple. Next to the temple a water cistern was found, suggesting the important role of water in rituals. The sanctuary was enclosed by a stoa with rooms of various functions. 125 Kalamoto: Rom marble head of Athena-Minerva 126 Dion: Rom marble statue of Zeus Ipsistos</page><page sequence="78">78 JAMES WHITLEY S. Pingiatoglou (AEMTH 17 [2003], 425-34) notes further work in the E and S sections of the Sanctuary of Demeter. Part of the stylobate of the stoa enclosing the sanctuary was uncovered at the E end. In the S section a building with three construction phases was excavated. The first phase is repre- sented by a stoa of the EIlmperial period. The other two phases, dating to the second half of the 2 and the E3 Cts AD, are repre- sented by auxiliary rooms, possibly for processing and storing cereals, along with a public latrine. Furthermore, a conduit, which carried water from the Temple of Asklepios to the pub- lic latrine, was investigated, supporting the assumption that the two sanctuaries (and cults in a broader sense) were associated. G. Karadedos (Eleutherotypia 9/2/2005) discusses the evi- dence that demonstrates the workings of the mechanisms used in the Hel theatre. D. Pantermalis (H Kathimerini 11/2/2005) discusses the excavation of a two-storey building (probably a luxurious shop), dated to the 3 Ct AD. In the cellar, which had many shelves, numerous vessels were recovered (e.g., a bronze oinochoe and glass kylikes), along with 130 bronze coins, dating to 210-250 AD. The coins depict Rom emperors, but in many cases there is only their name along with the head of Alexander the Great. Other finds include a bronze set of scales, a bronze disk, deco- rative bone plaques, tools and every-day vessels. Makrygialos. M. Pappa (ADelt, 586-88) reports on further excavation in the earlier levels of the LNeo settlement (Makrygialos I), dated to the L6 mill. BC. Parts of ditch A, which encircled the settlement, and of ditch F in the middle of the settlement were investigated. Each ditch appeared to have two distinctive construction phases, the earlier being comprised of a series of pits. Stone walls probably reinforced, at least in some parts, both ditches. Finds include large quantities of pot- tery (black- and brown-polished, black-surfaced and cw), ani- mal bones and shells, ground and polished stone tools, bone tools and antlers, along with charred organic remains. In the NW side of the excavated area pit-dwellings were investigated, yielding large quantities of pottery. M. Besios (ADelt, 588) notes a rescue excavation in plot 951. There were 194 graves dated to the EIA, Cl and EHel peri- ods. Pit graves predominate. Tile graves, enchytrismoi in pointed amphorae, a cist grave and a stone sarcophagus also occurred. The most usual burial practice is inhumation. Only two graves contain cremations. In one case charred bones were placed in a bronze lebes, while in the other case they were sim- ply placed in a pit. In the Agiasma and Aerogefira plots, Hel and Rom burials were investigated. Louloudies, Kitros, episcopical complex. E. Marki (ADelt, 602-09) reports on the partial restoration of the complex. Paliambela. P. Halstead (BSA/University of Sheffield) and K. Kotsakis (University of Thessaloniki) report on the 2004 season of excavation at this Neo settlement. The location of a series of pits at the N of the tell provide the first firm evidence of the ENeo occupation. The pits contained pottery, chipped stone and bone tools, and other small finds. Three or four closely-set rectangular buildings of the MNeo, separated by cobbled alleys or yards, were revealed in the centre of the tell. At the NW of the tell the excavation reached bedrock revealing a complex sequence of LNeo and MNeo cuttings above the massive ditch datable to an early stage of the MNeo. North Pieria. M. Bessios, F. Adaktylou, A. Athanasiadou, E. Gerofoka, K. Gagali and M. Christakou-Tolia (AEMTH 17 [2003], 434-41) discuss the rescue excavations conducted in the area. In Korinos, Revenia, an ENeo settlement was located just S of a stream. Surface data suggest that it covered 4 hectares, of which 750m was investigated. The architectural features included pits, circular or rectangular, which, according to their size, served as subterranean dwellings or storage pits. They contained large quantities of pottery, animal bones and shells. In some pits only animal bones or chipped stone tools were found. Postholes were also located, but only in one case did they form the shape of a rectangular building. Five burials, mainly placed in pits, were also found. Finds include abundant pottery, bone tools, ground, polished and chipped stone tools, clay sling bullets and bobbins, stone beads, stone and bone pen- dants, terracotta and marble figurines and clay seals. At Kitros, Hassan Vryssi, excavation took place in an EBA settlement. Foundation channels and postholes indicate rectangular struc- tures apparently destroyed by fire. Several storage or refuse pits rich in finds (pottery, animal bones, shells and small finds) were thoroughly investigated. There is firm evidence that bronze was processed locally. At Aiginio, Kapsovatis, part of a LBA settlement was excavated: the basement of a house, stor- age rooms with pits where pithoi were placed. Two pit graves yielded imported Myc pottery. At Katerini, along the Athens- Thessaloniki motorway, LCl and EHel dwellings were located. The most important find was a group of well-preserved pottery kilns (two rectangular kilns for firing large objects and a small round kiln for small objects). All were abandoned in the first quarter of the 3 Ct BC. M. Bessios, A. Athanasiadou, K. Noulas and M. Christakou- Tolia (AEMTH 17 [2003], 451-57) discuss the research con- ducted on the occasion of the construction of the aqueduct. A considerable number of sites were located, mainly PH but also from historical periods. In addition, one BA cemetery and eight cemeteries belonging to the historical periods were found. The excavation at Ritini revealed part of a dwelling, a large pit and parts of three ditches, dating from E to LNeo. At Palia Hrani building remains and pits, dating from the EBA to LBA, were recovered, along with two M-LBA pit burials. The site also yielded evidence of continuous habitation from the E5 Ct BC to mod. times. At Kastania B, graves of the second half of the 4 and the 3 Cts BC were investigated, accompanied by ceramic symposium vessels (rf kraters and pelikes). All the male burials contain an iron spearhead, and in one case, a life-size terracotta head of a sleeping youth (probably a replica of the deceased). At Kastania A, the foundation ditches of a fortification wall were located, dating to the period of the Macedonian wars. Methone. M. Bessios (AEMTH 17 [2003], 443-50) reports on the rescue excavation in a plot on the E hill of the anc. settle- ment. There is evidence of continuous habitation from the LNeo to the Ar period. On the W slope, under a deep fill creat- ed by erosion, an EIA embankment and well-preserved monu- mental Ar walls have been located. Krania, Neos Panteleimonas. E. Poulaki-Pantermali (ADelt, 588) notes the rescue excavation in the settlement identified as anc. Herakleion (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 53). The deposits, containing remains of several periods, were considerably dis- turbed by later activities. An apsidal building with two circular hearths in the interior belongs to the L8 and E7 Cts BC. The 5 and 4 Ct BC phase includes remains of buildings (probably workshops). Notable is the presence of a large number of wine amphorae. Heraklion was destroyed by the Romans, which explains the extensive destruction layer of the 2 Ct BC. There is also a destruction layer of the 3 Ct BC, which may be related to Scopa's invasion in Pieria. K. Lomverdou-Tsigarida (ADelt, 630-32) reports on tombs and kilns, probably of ECh date, at Krania.</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 79 Platamon castle. B. Xanthos, K.

A vari- ety of items came to light, noteworthy, however, are a construc- tion identified as a kiln for bread and foundations of a church. They also report (ADelt, 629-30) on small-scale excavations at the cemetery and the remains of buildings around church A. Of special interest are the glazed bowls of the 14 Ct and the foun- dations of kilns. Other constructions and tombs around church B were also excavated and yielded ECh ceramics. Pigi Athenas, Olympos. E. Poulaki-Pantermali (AEMTH 17 [2003], 459-63) reports on a rescue excavation in the area, which revealed remains that testify an active use of space over a long period of time. The earliest layers contain remains of LNeo occupation. Burials dated to the Myc, L MBA and E LBA were found. Also, a Cl-Hel farm with a pit containing large quantities of pottery and building material was excavated. Finally, a Rom farmstead dated to the 1-4 Ct AD was investi- gated, yielding numerous ceramic and glass vessels, loom weights and iron tools. NoMos OF CHALKIDIKE (16 EPCA; 10 EBA) Nea Kallikrateia. A. Bilouka and I. Graikos report (AEMTH 17 [2003], 379-89) on the rescue excavation in the area with public buildings, near the port of the anc. city. Part of a defen- sive wall (2.9m w., 1.15m h. and 7.5m 1.) was revealed, con- structed of successive rectangular mud courses, which run par- allel to the defensive coastal stone wall. Near the wall a struc- ture with a stone foundation and mud-brick superstructure was found. It probably served as a rampart. S of the wall two floors of an unidentified building were also investigated. One dates to the L5 Ct BC (according to the attic black-glazed and rf pottery) and the other to the first half of the 4 Ct B. (Attic black-glazed pottery was predominant). Other finds include bronze spear- heads (L5 Ct BC), stamped loom weights, terracotta figurines, Phoenician glass vessels and coins (Macedonian kingdom, but mostly Chalkidikian coinage) dated to the M5-M4 Ct BC. Potidaia. N. Kousoulakou (ADelt, 581) reports on a rescue excavation in Kalogirou plot where parts of walls, traces of a floor covered by destruction debris rich in tile fragments and a crude mosaic floor were revealed. All dated to LHel and ERom periods. A. Bilouka reports (ADelt, 581) on the rescue excavation in Karagianni plot. Part of a building and the foundations of Hel and ERom structures were recovered. Two pits were also inves- tigated (one of them plastered with clay), along with nineteen graves (eighteen pit graves and one tile grave) from L Antiquity, accompanied by some bronze jewellery. Athytos (anc. Aphytis). V. Misailidou-Despotidou (ADelt, 581-82) notes a rescue excavation in the area of the anc. ceme- tery. Eleven pit graves and two cist graves, all of the 5 Ct BC, were investigated. The grave goods include pottery (bf and rf lekythoi, bf and black-glazed kylikes, black-painted skyphoi, an amphora and a lekanis with painted decoration) and metal jew- ellery (earrings, rings and a clasp). She also reports (AEMTH 17 [2003], 323-33) on the rescue excavations in anc. Aphytis and the cemetery. Several buildings were partially excavated. One of them was most probably a house, of which two rooms with stone walls were investigated. One of the rooms might have been the andron, as rf symposium vessels suggests. The house was destroyed in the L4 Ct BC. Above the house a building of unidentified function was found. 11 7Atht1o 1: ( 1 fl uurinlc of aI femialec flute placr Two buildings were partially investigated in the Pilianidi plot. Both seemed to be shops: one providing pointed amphorae; the other clay pipes. Both buildings are dated by a coin of AEPOHIOX to the E4 Ct BC. They were destroyed in the L4 Ct BC by an earthquake, like many other buildings of the same period (including the house mentioned above). Further excavations in anc. Aphytis cemetery reinforce the assumption that inhumations in pit graves were characteristic for the Ar and ECl periods, while cremations were common for the second half of the 5 and the 4 Cts BC. Among the note- worthy finds from the cemetery is a terracotta figurine repre- senting a female flute player (Fig. 127), a type known from Olynthos. Kallithea. E. Tsigarida and S. Vasileiou (AEMTH 17 [2003], 335-42) report on rescue excavations in plots along the coast of the settlement, N of the Sanctuary of Ammon Zeus. Deposits from various periods were investigated. Above the earliest deposits with EIA pottery, a long building (34m 1.) of the sec- ond half of the 4 Ct BC was found. The building had a series of door openings in the N side and has been interpreted as a stoa, related to the sanctuary mentioned above. In the interior of the building, a rectangular base was found, probably part of the column supporting the roof. The latter was covered with Cor tiles, often with painted decoration. The latest deposit dat- ing to the 1 and 2 Cts AD, contained remains of four unidenti- fied buildings, along with a bath and a pottery kiln. In Byz times the area was used as a cemetery. Siviris. Ch. Augeros, I. Mavroidi and E. Tsigarida report (AEMTH 17 [2003], 359-68) on the rescue excavations on the hill of Vagia in Sibiri (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 54). In the N sector buildings and open spaces with structures related to food preparation activities were revealed. These are dated by pottery</page><page sequence="80">80 JAMES WHITLEY to the L EBA. In the S sector parts of walls were found. One of the walls, according to its distinctive dimensions (5m 1. and Im w.) probably served as a retaining wall. Pottery, including Minyan ware, dates this phase to the MBA. Also abundant were ground stone tools (pestles and mortars) and loom weights, while polished stone, chipped stone and bone tools were less in number. Nea Skioni. E. Tsigarida and D. Mantazi (AEMTH 17 [2003], 367-77) report on the rescue excavation in a plot at 'Panagia' site, lkm N of anc. Skioni. In the NW area of the plot part of a PH cemetery, comprised of stone periboloi, was investigated. The tombs held either cremations in urns or burials in pithoi. Only pithos burials had as offerings a loom weight, a cup and a bronze ornament. The burials date to the EBA according to the pottery. Part of a rectangular building was also investigated: the walls had stone foundations and mud-brick superstructures. Apart from a large amount of potsherds, the destruction layer of this building contained intact cups and one pithos in situ. The function and chronology of the building remain unknown. In the SE area of the plot part of the Ar cemetery, with pit and cist graves and burials in vessels (pithoi or amphorae of local workshops), was investigated. The walls of the cist graves were coated with clay slabs. In all cases infant burials with rich offerings were found. Attic bf vases (lekythoi, kylikes, skyphoi, amphorae) are predominant, along with Cor vessels (aryballoi) and local ones (amphorae). Other finds include terracotta human and animal figurines, glass Phoenician alabasters, silver bracelets and a bronze strigil. Olynthos-Ag. Mamas. B.

The cists contained clay urns with cremated bones. All the urns are hand-made vessels (amphorae, hydrias) covered with small vessels (phialae, cups), while small cups were used as offerings. The graves date to the EBA. Anc. Stageira. K. Sismanidis (ADelt, 584) notes the excava- tion in the anc. city, on the occasion of restoration works. The area of the Cl stoa and parts of two Ar stone walls were inves- tigated. Just to the W, outside the Cl fortification, a stone-paved road (30m 1. and 4m w.) was found, probably leading to the city through an adjacent gate. lerissos (anc. Akanthos). E.

Cl graves (162) were investigated; mainly pit graves and enchrytrismoi, but also tile graves and an inhuma- tion in a pithos. Adult burials predominate, accompanied by clay vessels, coinage, metal jewellery and figurines. In the anc. settlement, restoration work has been conducted along with excavation, when necessary. C1 and Hel remains were found, beneath which traces of an earlier habitation were encountered (parts of stone walls and a storage vessel in situ). Along the stream bank, adjacent to the archaeological site, a rectangular room of a Cl building was located. Gomati, Kalogerika. E. Trakosopoulou (ADelt, 585-86) notes a brief excavation in the cemetery, where circular grave periboloi of the M4 Ct BC were revealed (see AR 48 [2001-2002], 74). Anc. Sani. E. Tsigarida and S. Tsolakis discuss (Ethnos 10/02/05) the excavation of part of the anc. city. Impressive is the preservation of the walls of the houses (up to 2m h.) dated by Akanthian coins to the first half of the 4 Ct BC. Floor deposits yielded vessels representing Chalkidikian, Attic, Thasian and Ionic workshops. The city was abandoned in the M4 Ct BC, probably due to economic reasons, and the inhabi- tants moved to Akanthos. The Persian War Shipwreck Survey. S. Wachsmann (Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&amp;M University), reports on The Persian War Shipwreck Survey, a collaborative project of the Canadian Archaeological Institute at Athens (CAIA), the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities (EEA), directed by K. Delaporta, and the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR), directed by Chris Smith. The project aims to locate, map and record shipwrecks, their cargoes and related artefacts in areas where historical sources indicate that large fleets sank due to weather or battles during the Persian War. 'The second (2004) cruise continued the work of 2003 in the waters off Mt Athos. Work was carried out on the R/V Aegaeo, HCMR's 62m research vessel. HCMR's submersible, Thetis, which is rated to a d. of 600m, and its MaxRover class remote operated vehicle (ROV) permitted visual inspection of suspect locations. According to Herodotus, in or around 492 BC a gale destroyed nearly 300 ships of Darius's invasion fleet as it tried to round the Athos peninsula. In spite of certain doubts regard- ing numbers, the fact that Darius's son, Xerxes, later dug a canal across the Athos isthmus to allow his fleet to circumvent the peninsula indicates the effect that the sinking of this fleet had on the Persians. In 2003 we had carried out an extensive sidescan sonar sur- vey in the waters to the E and S of the peninsula. This survey covered approximately 170km of seabed. We also visually examined the SW area, near Cape Phonias, where two fisher- men in 1999 had raised two bronze Cl helmets in their nets. Examining the seabed in this area with an ROV, we located ajar at 96m into which a resident octopus had sequestered a pointed object. When raised this proved to be a bronze spear-butt spike (Gk. sauroter) with remains of the wooden shaft still within the socket. Cleaning revealed that it had a series of bands decorat- ing its socket: similar examples, dedicated as ex-votos, have been found at Olympia. During the 2004 season the team continued the examination of sidescan sonar anomalies along the E coast of the Athos peninsula. None of them proved to be of archaeological signif- icance. In some cases they seemed biogenic in origin, but over- all their identities remain unclear. The localization of two helmets and the sauroter in a rela- tively well-defined area of seabed led the team to focus its attention during the 2004 season on the SW shores of the Athos peninsula, in the hope of finding more such material. Additionally, the discovery of these items, as well as ceramic artefacts, indicates that in this region the rate of sedimentation has been such that we might expect to discover anc. artefacts by visual inspection. We relocated and raised the jar that had held the sauroter: it contained no other artefacts. At present the date of this ceramic vessel remains unclear. It may be of relatively recent date. If so, this might explain why it sat fully exposed on the seabed, although it lay within a few meters of an amphora half buried in the sediment. Alternatively, the jar's relatively exposed condition may be the result of it having been displaced from its original resting place by a net in more recent times. Discoveries include two groups of amphorae located by the MaxRover. The first, found directly below the location of the</page><page sequence="81">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 81 128 C1 Mendean amphora sauroter jar and at a d. of 130m, is a tight group of six amphorae. The find location of this amphora cluster, as well as its d., coincide well with the information supplied by the fish- erman regarding the location and d. from where he estimated that his net had raised the two helmets. From this group Thetis raised one amphora, which Mark Lawall (University of Manitoba) identified as Mendean (Fig. 128) and dated to the second quarter of the 4 Ct BC. At present it remains to deter- mine whether the amphorae and the weaponry derive from the same ship, or from different vessels. A second group of amphorae found in the same region but in shallower water dates to the Byz period. In addition, one mod. cargo was also identified: a collection of salt-glazed pottery, which possibly dates to the 18 or 19 Ct. These discoveries clearly indicate that the S coast of Mt Athos has been a hazard to shipping for millennia and thus constitutes a rich underwater archaeological zone.' EASTERN MACEDONIA NOMOS OF SERRES (18 EPCA; 12 EBA) Promachonas-Topolnica. H. Koukouli-Chrysanthaki, I. Aslanis, I. Vaisov and M. Valla (AEMTH 17 [2003], 91-110) summarize the joint Greek-Bulgarian research on the LNeo set- tlement that expands across the Gr-Bulgarian border. Three phases of habitation have been identified, dated to the end of the 6 to the second half of the 5 mill. BC (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 55). The earliest phase (I) is represented by semi-subterranean dwellings, constructed with wattle and daub walls. Part of an unusually large pit with several successive floors has been inves- tigated. Deposits of this pit were rich in storage, drinking and rit- ual vessels, figurines, tools, quern stones and animal bones. The presence of intact bucrania together with ritual vessels and two clay models of houses points to ritual activities and suggests a possible communal character of this building (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 730). Dwellings in phase II were not semi-subterranean, but free-standing, built on the ground. They are rectangular, with wattle and daub walls and floors of compacted soil. There is evi- dence of metallurgical activities: a clay crucible was recovered in association with pits filled with ashes and burnt soil (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 729). Phase III deposits have been severely damaged by ploughing and only traces of pits with scarce archae- ological material were found. C14 dates place this phase in 4500-4300 BC. The site yielded a wide variety of pottery. Painted pottery of Acropotamos type, multicoloured painted ves- sels, black-surfaced, red-surfaced and bitumen-painted pottery were found in deposits of phases I and II. In phase III graphite, incised and black on red pottery is present. Figurines are often found in phases I and II (ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 730). Byz Serres. K.

Valla (AEMTH 17 [2003], 111-25), reports on rescue excavations in four plots, on the outskirts of the anc. city, which has recently been identified as anc. Berge. Two plots, in the N part of the settlement, yielded exclusively inhumation and jar burials of infants, all dated to the 4 Ct BC. Also, deposits rich in pottery, mainly Hel, but also with Ar examples, were found in this area. The excavations in the third plot (to the NE of the settlement) revealed burials of the Ar, Hel and Rom periods. In the fourth plot, placed at some distance from the settlement, burials of the 6 and E5 Cts BC were found. Ag. Christophoros. M.

Malamidou (ADelt, 730-31) reports on the rescue excavations of a Macedonian tomb (tumulus) in Alepotripa Mesolakkias. In the SE side of the tumulus a cist grave, a pithos burial and a cremation were investigated, all dated to the last quarter of the 4 Ct BC. In the E side an Ar cist grave was excavated. Finds include gold leaves, a Cor exaleip- tron and an iron belt. The grave was covered by a low mound, surrounded by a stone enclosure. An adjacent hearth yielded remains of offerings from funerary ceremonies, including large quantities of animal bones and charred cereals. In the area of the EHel cemetery (ADelt, 731) seventeen graves of the 4 Ct BC were investigated. These were mainly cist graves, but there was also a cremation and one cylindrical cist grave with two urns (a rf hydria and a Kerch pelike), accompanied by a bronze mirror, a gilt bronze wreath and a gold ring. The richest in finds was a male burial in a cist grave; it yielded rf and black-glazed vessels, iron and bronze strigils, rings and Amphipolis coinage. A female burial contained terra- cotta figurines, astragaloi, a gilt clay necklace, a bronze bracelet, a silver Amphipolis ovolos and three aryballoid lekythia. In the area of the Hel cemetery of Kastrolakka (ADelt, 731) four graves of the L4 Ct BC were investigated: a tile grave, a cremation, a cist grave and a stone sarcophagus. The latter had rich offerings including a gold olive wreath, two gilt bronze wreaths, gold earrings and bands for decorating clothes, four iron strigils, vessels and terracotta figurines. A limestone quar- ry, from which most of the material used for the funerary mon- uments in the Hel necropolis of Amphipolis was derived, was located in the vicinity of the graves. Byz Amphipolis. N.

Argilos. Z. Bonias (ADelt, 727), reports on the excavation in the S section of the anc. city, where houses A, B and C were investigated (see also AR 48 [2001-2002], 83). In house A the NW part was revealed and the existence of an upper floor was confirmed. In house B room B 1 was uncovered, along with the whole ground plan of the house, which appears to have three constructional phases. In the first phase (L6-E5 Ct BC) the house had two rooms. In the second phase (second half of the 5 Ct BC) the ground plan remains unclear. In the third phase (first quarter of the 4 Ct BC) the house had only one room. House C appears to have had two phases: the main phase is con- temp6rary with the second phase of house B, while the last phase was of short duration. All three houses were destroyed in the M4 Ct BC. J. Perreault (Canadian Institute) reports on work conducted in the SE and national road sectors of the anc. city at Argilos. In the SE sector, activities were confined to building G in the SW, in order to clear the NE comer of the structure. Continuing along the E side, another, earlier wall adjoining the E wall was found, suggesting that both walls of building G (both nearly Im w.) supported an imposing structure yet to be found. In the national road sector, deposits with burnt debris contained pot- tery and other finds, dating from the first half of the 6 Ct. Pottery includes cooking vessels (probably local), pottery from Thrace and Chalkidike, local and regional Gr wares, some from distant production centres (E Greece, the Cyclades, Corinth, Athens, etc.).

All the phases investigated belong to L Antiquity. In room C3, in the zone of hypocausts, the praefurnium was uncovered (Fig. 130), adjacent to the pillar bases. In room C4 three major building phases were investigated. The earlier phase of the building included well- preserved opus signinum. The next phase was represented by a thick destruction layer. On top of this layer a series of installa- tions, such as a hearth, associated with a pebbled floor, was found, allowing the identification of the room as a kitchen. In room C7 two closely connected occupation layers, represented by pebble floors, are preceded by a destruction phase contain- ing building material and mosaic fragments. The destruction of this floor was most likely due to re-building works, which mod- ified the plan of the room. An open-air channel (hydraulic installation) of about 1.50m 1. represents the only remains of the first building phase in the series of rooms of the E facade. In the W half of room C9 a channel constructed of re-used materi- als rested on a layer rich in ash and poor in material. In room C11 a pillar of bricks was found, which had collapsed en masse.</page><page sequence="83">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 83 130 Phillippi, 'Maison des Fauves': hypocaust, room C3 There is strong evidence that the pillar, as well as the octagon and the basilica in Pavlidis plot, were destroyed by an earth- quake at the beginning of the 7 Ct. Bellow the remains men- tioned above in rooms C9 and C11, two narrow 'basins' were found. The function of this double room C9-Cll1 remains unclear (perhaps large latrines, or a washing area). The deposits of room C9 were rich in finds. Worth mentioning are one vase re-used as a funerary urn and 134 coins (of all periods), scat- tered all over the room. T his remarkable amount of coins could be partially explained by the existence of a hoard, hidden in an organic container, at some height (on the first floor?) and scat- tered at the time of the destruction by a fire. S of room C11, a narrow (1.10m) passageway (C12) was found leading to room C11 and to the small latrine (Fig. 131). Also, room C13 was investigated revealing a stucco relief decoration (Fig. 132).

Parts of walls and the stylobate of a stoa, dated by coins (Pella, Amphipolis and Thessaloniki) to the E2 Ct BC, belong to the first phase. The second phase, characterized by a large workshop complex relat- ed to iron working, is dated to the first half of the 3 Ct AD. In the third phase (4 Ct AD) small changes are noted in the archi- tecture of the workshop complex, which was abandoned by the end of the 4 Ct AD. Ofrynio. P.

Marc reports on the 2004 study season: The opus sectile decoration of the macellum, along with cw and imported pottery of the Imperial period were studied, while three-dimensional recon- structions were developed. There has been progress in the completion of the architectural plan and its reconstruction. 'The foun- dations of the stylobates of the macellum courtyard and the re-used blocks of the stylobates have been drawn, indicating the existence of a colonnade on at least three sides (SE, SW and NW). The fourth side, along the wall behind the porch, remains unknown and although a colonnade is not evident, as is the case with the front of the rooms of the other sides, it is not improbable. One of the blocks of the stylo- bates shows traces of positioning of bases for two columns. The colonnade was of Ionic order, as one would expect from a building of this period. It is possible that the two fragments of denticulate cor- nices, discovered by F. Salviat in 1962, could belong to its frieze, since the dimensions correspond. The reconstruction of the colonnade of the court- yard of the hundred flagstones (Fig. 133) was undertaken, confirming my hypothesis that an entab- lature (interrupted by an arch, in front of the great entrance of the macellum through the Court of 100 Flagstones) and a vaulted corridor between the Court of the 100 Flagstones and the macellum existed. Re-study of old excavation journals has led us to suggest the existence of an important building locat- ed less than 20m from the Court of 100 Flagstones. The sketches indicate the vestiges of baths (hypocaust pipes, floor paved in terracotta slabs). Apart from doubling the number of known bath complexes, this discovery could be related to the statues found earlier in this area. Investigation of this complex is now being considered.' The decoration in opus sectile was also studied, permitting some remarks: 'The first point concerns the relative variety of the marbles employed: Thasos marble, obviously, was employed but also Fior di pesco, Carrara, Portasanta, etc. The investigation of polychromy in this type of wall decoration explains the appeal of marbles of different provenance: it is, however, still surprising to find in an island like Thasos, which is famous for its crustae of white marble, slabs from Carrara. This research also allowed the reconstruction of a decoration which used not only slabs but also relief decorations: we have definitely identified bases and capitals of pillars. The final sur- prise was the discovery that the panels could have been deco- rated with very fine geometrical motifs, and not only with large slabs representing an opus quadratum.' The macellum is revealed to be a very elaborate building, whose decoration made it quite luxurious. It seems that it was used as a commercial gallery and not as a food market in the imperial period.' Northern surroundings of the Artemision. M. Sgourou, F. Blonde, A. Muller, N. Beaudry, M. Kohl and T. Kozelj (EFA) report on the DOM5 complex and its E surroundings: 'The results of the 2004 excavation allowed important gen- eral conclusions to be drawn. It is now certain that the whole surface, delimited by the street of the acropolis and the place called Theoroi to the S, the Dionysion street to the W and the theatre street to the E, represents a single complex. This complex</page><page sequence="85">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 85 is ca 26m E-W and 45m N-S (the N boundary is still to be deter- mined) and extends mostly through the Delcos plot, the Valma plot and along the W side of the Kokkinos plot. To this com- plex (spatial entity DOM5) belong the rooms, the baths and the service courtyard discovered in the Valma plot (excavations 1979-1984), three rooms (one of them with a mosaic) of the Delcos plot (trench 1971), as well as the rooms which have been identified this year in the Kokkinos plot. The preservation of the walls of these rooms, protected by the W terrace-wall, is excellent. It is tempting to suppose a distribution of these rooms around a central court (perhaps with a peristyle). We collected several fragments of columns. Only general spatial organiza- tion of the E wing, partially excavated this year, could be made out: it seems dominated by a large oblong single-storey room, closed in its E part by a horseshoe-shaped apsis. At the S and the N side of this area, there were oblong rooms (4m by 6.50m). In the S wing (Valma plot) rectangular rooms were excavated. The N wing appears larger than the S wing.' There is strong evidence that this complex was a large and luxurious residence, the largest civil building yet to be found on Thasos. The results of the excavations (1971, 1979-1984 and 2004) allowed the reconstruction of the main phases of this complex. It was constructed at the beginning of the 5 Ct AD. Later, it was transformed and the baths were added, afterwards it was pro- longed through the addition of a service courtyard against the S wing. Its first destruction dates to 560-570 and the last to just after 620, perhaps in Slavic raids. Finds include inscriptions (funerary inscription: PTOLE- MAIS MAGADATOU found in the destruction layer of ESP13), a large fragment of a Rom honorary decree, in honour of a Thasian couple, sculptures including a fragment of the bor- der plate of a gate which represents Daniel in the lions' den (now partially in the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul, with other fragements found near the Artemision in 1985), as well as various architectural members. Thasos, rampart. Y. Grandjean and F. Salviat (EFA) report on the 2004 study season, which aimed to achieve a better under- standing of stratigraphical relations between the circuit wall and the nearby temple situated in the vicinity of the Thesmophorion (SE of Evraiokastro). 'In 2003, a trench (of 0.80m) was opened between the tem- ple and the rampart. This trench has been extended to the S in 2004. The excavation reached the bedrock. The stratigraphy showed that the rampart collapsed twice, in the Imperial period and the EChr period. A wall, connecting the circuit wall to the E comer of the temple along the extension line of the NE wall of the temple, was constructed at the same time as the rampart. This wall was founded, like the temple, on the bedrock. It was associated with midden deposits, contemporary with the con- struction of the circuit. These deposits were poor in finds (sherds of cw, but also fragments of Ar tiles) which cannot be dated securely. One floor (associated with the rampart, the tem- ple and the wall which connected them) separated the destruc- tion layers from the building with the circuit wall. The destruc- tion layers did not provide evidence for its dating. However, on top of it fragments of stamped tiles of the 3 Ct BC were found.' Thasos excavations. J. Foumier reports on the study of the 957 Imperial coins discovered during the Thasos excavations, which aimed to associate this corpus with that of the foreign and Thasian coins of the Imperial period. The study is part of the project on coin circulation in Thasos during this period. She also reports on the study of the votive material from the Artemision, excavated in 1980-1982: 'These finds do not alter our general understanding of the corpus of votive material from the sanctuary, which now numbers over 1,000 objects, includ- ing some interesting pieces like an omphalos of opaline. Astris, Theologos. S. Papadopoulos (ADelt, 721-22) notes the rescue excavations in the Z. S. Morali plot. Part of a LRom farmstead was investigated. Under the paved floor of one room a family burial of the 2 Ct AD containing five adult skeletons was found. It was probably an isolated grave, belonging to an earlier farmstead. Agios loannis Loukas. S. Papadopoulos (ADelt, 722-25) reports on the excavation of the building, three rooms and a storage structure, dating to the L6 Ct BC. A large press and a mill, along with vessels related to the storage of oil, indicate the existence of an oil workshop. Intensive survey in the area located evidence of PH and Ar habitation, remains of a tower, a well, LRom remains and two seasonal farming sites (ADelt, 725). In the PH habitation area four trenches were opened, revealing deposits dating to the Final Neo and EBA. Clay floors, hearths, refuse pits and other features were investigated. Also, Laconian tiles, black-painted and bf Thasian pottery, bronze jewellery and weapons, dating to the L6 Ct BC, were found in the same area, suggesting a con- siderable disturbance of the deposits. Trapezia Prinou. S. Papadopoulos (ADelt, 725-27) reports that an installation with an enclosure was investigated. Walls appear to divide the interior space.

Behtsi (AEMTH 17 [2003], 63-64) report that excavations continued in undisturbed EBA layers, yielding rubble walls and a heating structure (with a clay floor and three sub-strata comprised of sherds, pebbles and slab stones). Other finds included fishing and loom weights, stone axes, pottery decorated with sgraffito and impressed motifs, as well as objects related to the processing of metal. Theologos. S. Papadopoulos and A. Behtsi (AEMTH 17 [2003], 64-66) note that three LBA and EIA sites were investigated in the mountains near Theologos. At Koukoudia (possibly a pastoral settlement), a circular structure with pits containing animal bones, shells, a large amount of quartz and hand-made cw pottery was excavated. At Ai Lias part of a wall that apparently sur- rounded the acropolis was investigated. At Popinas Mandra an enclosure, identical to the previous one, was located. All three sites were probably occasional habitations associated with for- tified refuges (Ai Lias) or settlements (Kastri). F.

Remains of a monumental Rom building (8.90m w., 45m 1., 2m h.), dated to the L2-E3 Ct AD were revealed. Ten square pil- lars, presumably supporting the roof, were found in the interior of the building. Just to the N a similar structure was found, probably part of the same building complex . This complex seemed to have had a public-commercial character (e.g., store- room for cereals), related to the port. Maroneia was a large commercial centre in Rom times. N of this complex, part of a paved road constructed with large marble slabs, along with an underground water conduit, was revealed. The road seemed to be related to the building complex and to the Propylon of Hadrian (uncovered in 1973), suggesting that it led from the propylon to the agora. The excavated area was rich in finds: architectural features, statues, reliefs, red-painted and terra sig- illata pottery, clay lumps, figurines, metal and bone small finds, jewellery and 550 bronze coins. Maroneia-Kampana. A. Tsoka and C. Karadima (Eleutherotypia 14/2/2005) note the excavation of a Hel private building, located SW of the anc. theatre of Maroneia. The building had five rooms, organized around a yard. Part of a mosaic floor was revealed, along with finds (coins, pottery, fig- urines) coming from Thasos, Chalkidike and SE Aegean. The building was abandoned in the first quarter of the 2 Ct AD. Anc Stryme. D. Terzopoulou (ADelt, 739-40) reports on the geophysical survey carried out by 19 EPCA and the Institute of Mediterranean Studies in Crete. Based on the survey results, five trenches were chosen for excavation. Wall foundations were revealed, along with abundant pottery (pointed amphorae, every-day and black-glazed ware, dating to the second half of the 4 Ct BC) and coins. All the coins come from Maroneia and date 398/7-386 or 377-365 BC. NoMos OF EVROS (19 EPCA; 12 EBA) Mikri Doxipara-Zoni. D. Triantafyllos and D.

Four cre- mation burials, five carts and two horse burials (Fig. 134) were thoroughly investigated, along with several areas with remains of offerings, two hearth pits and two four-sided brick structures that were used as altars. The five carts, together with the hors- es, had been placed in shallow pits. All carts preserve the axles, iron wheel rims and other functional and decorative elements, slightly differing in each case. Four cremation burials were located at different places in the mound, two of which were exceptionally rich in grave goods, including a large number of metal, glass, clay, stone and wooden objects.

Geomorphological-geological, underwater and coastal research, test drilling study of the stratigraphy and geophysical investiga- tion were undertaken. Sanctuary of the Great Gods. James McCredie (New York University/ASCSA) reports on the 2004 study season: 'On the E hill, the architectural remains of the theatral circle, a dedication of Philip III and Alexander IV, the Ionic porch attached to it, the monument platforms, and outer grandstand, and the sacred way were studied for publication. The restored section drawing through the E hill and restored plans demon- strating the area's architectural development and individual fea- tures were completed. Context pottery, metal and glass finds and coins were examined, catalogued and prepared for publica- tion. Conservation to protect the surface of the inscribed epistyle blocks from the dedication of Philip III and Alexander IV continues. Under the direction of Demitris Matsas, repairs and small conservation measures on the site discussed last season were carried out. In the central area of the sanctuary, the culvert in front of the altar court was repaired. On the E hill, the NE sec- tion of the orchestra of the theatral circle was stabilized with an under-girding of fieldstones, and stones which had fallen out of the S rubble wall of the building beneath the dedication of Philip III and Alexander IV were set back into place. NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS (20th EPCA; 3rd EBA) Lemnos Surface investigations indicated architectural remains of the LRom-ECh period at Agios Ermolaos Atsikis, and the remains of a Byz fortress with square towers and graves of the same period near the village of Plaka. Myrina. L. Acheilara (ADelt, 780-82) reports on two exca- vations, which revealed evidence of occupation from the Hel to the Rom period. At O. Kyda (Tsinopoulou plot) excavation revealed walls only of recent date, whereas the movable finds include stamped handles, a clay hypocaust, a fragment of a figurine mould, figurines, a loom weight, a whorl and column capitals, all of which date to the Hel and Rom peri- ods. At Tourkikos Yialos, O. Parisidi-Dionysou (Kamamis plot) a habitation area with three building phases of the Rom period was investigated. The architectural elements include ashlar as well as stone-built plastered walls, an open court, a well, two built drains with clay floors; the finds include a bronze herm, an Ionic capital, the base of a small column, a Doric capital and the upper part of a panel. Hephaisteia. E.

In the S part of the trench an imposing wall, oriented E-W, pre- served to a maximum h. of 1.55m, a 1. of 2.20m and a max- imum w. of 0.44m was discovered. The wall (Fig. 137) was constructed with large pseudo-polygonal blocks, interposed with smaller stones without mortar, and is preserved in three courses. It is dated by the pottery to the Ar period. In this part of the trench excavation terminated at a layer containing traces of burnt material. This layer was characterized either by the presence of pebbles and stones, especially in the E part of the trench, or by the rarity of Ar pottery.' Lesbos Mytilini. L. Acheilara and P. Avgerinou (ADelt, 766-71) report on five excavations, which revealed evidence of occupation from the EBA to the Ot period. At the area of Mitropoli, O. Ermou-Isauron (Psarellis plot) a wall of the LRom period, on which walls, paved floors and a well of the Ot period were founded; at O. Ermou 196-198 (Anastasakos plot) Ot architec- tural remains, probably of a house in three building phases, were found. At Synoikismos, O. Krinis (Girgetsou plot) a Hel wall was detected. At the pier, 0. Kountouriotou (Vostaneion Hospital plot) a Hel shipyard came to light, as well as part of a pier dating to the Rom period. At Sourada, O. El. Venizelou (Chatzakis-Pavlakellis plot) excavation continued and two EBA buildings and an intramural burial were excavated; abundant pottery corresponds to Thermi III-IV periods. The construction of a central sewage system offered the opportunity for thirteen excavations in various streets of the city with finds dating from the Hel to the Ot period, but mostly of the Rom period, on which L. Acheilara (ADelt, 771-76) reports: Epano Skala. At O. Lesbonaktos, part of a Rom bath was revealed, along with part of the Ot cemetery; a further two rooms contained pottery dating from the Ar to the Rom period. At O. Navmachias Ellis-Lesbonaktos excavations took place in the area of the Hel stoa, known since 1929 to be near the N port and the agora of the anc. city; the N, W and S walls of the stoa were revealed, its founding in the L4th Ct was established, and two walls dating to the Rom period point to a second building phase and the end of its use. At O. Navmachias Ellis disturbed Ot graves and a Hel wall were excavated; finds include mostly amphora sherds, bs and red-slipped sherds, a lamp, a loom weight, a stone column and a female figurine. At the area of Kourtzi, O.

Among these two grave ste- lae were collected, one bearing the inscription KAEOHATPA ANTONIAX XPHXTH XAIPE; the burials date to the Rom period. Also, Hel architectural remains in two building phas- es were investigated to the W of the graves. At Chryssomaloussa at the junction of O. Theophilopoulou with an alley, part of a Rom road came to light. At O. Chryssomaloussas-Yakinthou part of a Rom stone-built drain was excavated, probably part of a watering system for gardens in the area. At O.

Neomartyros Theodorou a stone-built drain, as well as an open drain, and part of a colos- sal marble statue preserved from the middle of the waist down to the beginning of the thighs were found. At O. Karkavitsa architectural remains of the Rom period were excavated (walls, the bottom of a sarcophagus, a paved road). At Pyrgelia, O. Milou, a cist grave with two burials and the comer of a burial monument were excavated. During works for the road from Mytilini to Thermi, exca- vations revealed part of a cemetery, which probably extended along the anc. road. L. Acheilara and A. Dova (ADelt, 776-77) report on 77 Hel graves opposite ENA Ltd (former Goggolidis establishments) (56 cist graves, three sarcophagi, two chests, three rock-cut graves, three simple pits), remains of two burial periboloi and a well; eleven cist graves, three chests and a sim- ple pit, all dating to the Hel period, as well as part of a paved road opposite the military camp of EYP; ten graves (six cist graves, a shaft grave, a rectangular chest and a jar with the con- tents of a cremation) opposite the military camp of EYP, near Katsakoulis and Vassiniotis plot; 25 graves (thirteen cist graves, four rectangular chests, five simple burials and two cremations) near the ware-houses of ENA Ltd (former Goggolidis establish- ments).

At Agios Georgios (Kounellis field) a Hel cist grave was excavated, containing sherds of a bs perfume flask and fragments of an iron scraper. At Tsiliki (Kolyvas and Chatzigiannou-Kolyva field) the exca- vation near the Sanctuary of Artemis Thermia revealed archi- tectural remains in two building phases dating to the Rom and LRom periods. Pyrgoi Thermis. L. Acheilara (ADelt, 778) reports on an excavation in Nianiou plot revealing walls and paved floors of the LRom period. Finds include roof tiles and plain pottery. Apothika. L. Acheilara (ADelt, 778-79) reports on an exca- vation in Mnimoria (Maggeros field), which revealed walls of the Rom period, two kilns, an alum stone workshop for the pro- duction of alum in two building phases, and four storerooms in the shape of a truncated cone containing the raw material (con- clusion reached after sampling of the soil for IGME). The study of the sample by M. Varti-Mataraga suggests a local prove- nance, and the proximity of the site to an anc. city suggests that the material was traded through the city's port. Mythimna. L. Acheilara and A. Dova (ADelt, 779-780) report on excavations in three locations revealing evidence of occupation from the Ar to the Hel period. At the provincial road from Molyvos to Eftalou (to the E of Mygias plot, where an apsidal Ar building and Hel graves had been excavated) fur- ther excavations revealed 5 cist graves, one rock-cut and a sim- ple burial, all dating to the Hel period. The graves were dispersed among Ar architectural remains with walls built in the Lesbian masonry; finds include miniature kantharoi, miniature amphorae, miniature kylix, arytiras, miniature pots, figurines, eight glass beads. At the junction of O. Goutou-Kepetzi walls, drains and floors of the EHel period came to light; an animal, probably dog, burial was accompanied by a plain globular perfume flask, a lead object, a bronze object and a clay loom-weight. At Tsipouri, a partly destroyed Hel cist grave was excavated, and was found to contain a gold ring, silver coins, a bronze mirror, clay pots, an iron ring, an iron scraper, a bronze coin.

At Vounaki, O. Kaloudi-Gymnasiarchou Anastasiadi (Municipality of Chios plot), rectangular rooms with entrances (I-IV), which belonged to an EAr building were excavated. Room IV contained three large pithoid jars, which date to the Rom period; a stone-built open drain was also found. Finds include pottery and sherds, stone tools, loom weights, fig- urines, lamps, a fragment of a marble object, whorls, a small ball, marble weights, a stone grinder and coins. At Vounaki, O. Agion Apostolwn (Dimitriou plot) a LCI (4th Ct BC) rubbish pit in the form of an ovoid pit dug in the rock was excavated. It contained mostly transport amphorae, loom weights (one stamped), fragments of roof tiles with ionic cyma and rf sherds. At Evangelistria, O. Kountouriotou (Alexopoulou plot), exca- vation revealed a built apsidal drain, two rectangular struc- tures, an oblong structure destroyed in its S side by a well, which subsequently functioned as a rubbish pit (it contained abundant LHel/ERom sherds and fragments of figurines) to the E part of the plot and various walls to its W side (finds from the latter include an undecorated pot, a bs lamp, a stone object, a loom weight of ovoid shape and a coin dated to the Rom peri- od). At Agia Anna Kapela, O. Chaviara (Margouni plot), the continuation of the LHel-ERom drainage system with stone- built drains was revealed. Underneath lay a building of the C1 period, used until the LHel period, a rubbish pit of the same period which contained a variety of finds (mostly identified as workshop discards) and another rubbish pit with Ar period objects. Finds include figurines, a fragment of a relief-decorat- ed plaque, a relief fragment, clay moulds, sherds, pot fragments, a miniature wheel-made lamp and bronze Chian coins.

Viglaki (ADelt, 796-801) report on excavations in three different locations revealing evi- dence of occupation from the Ar to the LByz period. Ancient Samos-Ano Poli. Two cisterns, a well and an imposing luxurious building, initially thought of as a 'mansion' but subsequently seen as a 'palatial type building' have been excavated. In the building two mosaic floors of the 2 Ct BC were discovered in the two main rooms, one of which is speci- fied as a male residence area (andron), and a third room with a white mosaic floor were discovered; the rooms were also deco- rated with wall-paintings. A monumental Ar fountain was also located (4m h.). The foundations of an Ar votive base, so com- mon in the Heraion, make the two monumental constructions the first Ar remains to be discovered in the upper part of the town. A concentration of clay drains lead to the discovery of the stomion of a built rectangular well of the 6 Ct BC, which opens to a tunnel dug into the rock. It thus appears that the fountain, the well and the tunnel belong to the intramural section of Eupalinos' tunnel, and that a central irrigation system was built for the city of Samos by the tyrant Polycrates, much like the one that was built for Athens by Peisistratos. It is possible that an earlier Ar wall is located near the fountain. At the Andreadakis plot in the area of the anc. agora, part of a paved Rom road, remains of a public building and of a drain, as well as a Byz grave were found. At Kasdaglis-Belekoukias plot (O.T. 55) walls, a marble threshold and two open drains, probably belong- ing to a big public building dated at the latest to the Hel period, were uncovered. Finds date from the Hel to the LByz period and include plain pottery, bs and red-slipped sherds, iron nails, a few bronze coins, fragments of glass vessels and marble fragments. Eupalinos' tunnel.

Televantou (ADelt, 789-91) reports on the first season of excavation in a settlement that appears to date to a L phase of the LNeo period (Final Neo or Chal). Surface sur- vey, based on finds such as obsidian artefacts, stone tools and pottery, indicated that the plateau in the W part of the island, between Palaiopolis and Zagora, is the location of an extended (3 hectares) LNeo settlement. Architectural remains are pre- served to a relatively low h., and are covered by piles of stones, amassed by farmers during field clearance. The excavation of a rectangular building, founded on the bedrock, revealed numerous objects. Pottery includes cw with cylindrical necks and vertical strap handles, some with rope decoration, with par- allels from Kefala and Alepotrypa; fineware, such as a cup with a pierced raised strap handle, with parallels from Saliagos, Kefala and Emporio in Chios; a small closed krater-like vessel, although Neo in shape, recalls ECyc craters; open vessels, such as bowls in various shapes and sizes, with strap or pierced hor- izontal cylindrical handles, incised handles, double handles or with ears in the shape of an elephant's head, with parallels in Kea and the agora of Athens. Surface treatments of these ves- sels include brownish-reddish to black burnish, and besides the rope pattern, incisions and red-burnished linear motifs appear, characteristic of Kefala, Zas, Agora, Aigina and Skoteini Tharounion in Euboeia. The numerous stone tools include pes- tles made of big pebbles split in half, 30 whole pebbles used as grinders, three leaf-shaped obsidian arrowheads (a rarity in the LNeo Cyclades), obsidian blades, obsidian fragments and an obsidian core. Further finds include numerous animal bones and shells, some of which were chipped, a small piece of cop- per, two small pieces of raw rock crystal and a gold bead, which indicates relations with the Balkans. The finds correspond in general with the Attica-Aigina-Kefala culture, and particularly with neighbouring Kea. Byz Andros, Mesaria. A.

The cleaning confirmed the plan of the building originally drawn in 1957 (Fig. 138) and will permit the production of a new one. Features that were cleaned include the flagstone pavement in front of the floors of the oikoi of the E courtyard (oikoi 2, 3, 4 and 5), elements of the S extremity of the W wall of oikos 5 and the comer of the E and S walls of oikos 3, as well as the chan- nel which crossed the sanctuary from E to W. The translation and study of inscriptions, which refer to repairs in the sanctuary and the vases offered every year to Aphrodite, as well as two series of inventories from the Athenian period, continued from last year.

The sectors to the E and S of the apsidal monument (GD 39) were investigated in order to explain a hiatus in the plan between the E of GD 39 and the sacred way. To the E of GD 39 two foundations of monu- ment bases (F100 and 101) were discovered. The first was made of granite blocks, flanked to the N by horizontal gneiss slabs, probably corresponding to a floor; low walls (E-W, N-S) held a fill above it which consisted of mortared rubble, and which continues under the limestone slabs flanking the E wall of the stoa of the Artemision (F 200). This fill had to end in the W against the wall of the apsidal monument and against the peribolos wall of temple G (the rock is visible in various places). These structures are surely contemporary with the pavement of the sacred way, for which the soil level was raised. Two building phases can be distinguished: first, the construc- tion of base F100 and a pavement, second, the construction of the sacred way as well as the small monuments surrounding it. A long foundation (F 101), made of blocks of different sizes and materials (poros limestone, granite and gneiss), belongs to this second phase. Thirty foundations between the propylon and the apsidal monument to the S of GD 39 were catalogued, interpreted and marked on the plan (except Fl 12). Their study will permit us to establish a chronology, even a history, of the sacred way. A study of the space between the propylon and the paved area to the S of GD 49, is also projected; it should change, and clarify, the reconstruction of various monuments and their orientations, including the equestrian statue of king Massinissa. G. Finkieljsztejn studied the stamped amphorae from the recent excavations at the Agora of the Italians. The presence of Rhodian and Knidian 2-El Ct BC material dates the construc- tion of the agora to the beginning of the 1 rather than the end of the 2 Ct BC (GD 52).'

Microscopic study at variable magnifications (25-175 times) recorded digitally, continued. Minute traces of paint and gild- ing have thus been discovered on surfaces that exhibited no apparent traces of colour. Subsequently, 96 sample points on statues, picked out by the video-microscope, were analysed (X fluorescence method) in order to clarify the nature of the anc. materials (pigments, loads and undercoats, gilding). It became evident that micro-sanding and other methods of scouring surfaces should be avoided by conserva- tors until verification that traces of colour/gilding are absent. Results include gilding and leaf white (used as fine undercoat) traced on the body of Apollo (Delos, A 4135), a pale and cold yellow of vanadinite, a rare pig- ment, on the Artemis from the Maison des Cinq Statues (Delos, A 4126), gold leaf applied on the entire surface of the Diadoumenos of Polykletos (NMA 1826), including the supporting tree trunk. The exami- nation of the Petite Herculanaise (NMA 1827) demon- strates the extreme care which the craftsman showed for the circumlitio, the process of colouring details mentioned by Pliny the Elder; that of the group of Aphrodite, Eros and Pan (NMA 3335) demonstrates the role of colours in enriching the effect of sculpture, e.g., with red trickles on the tree-trunk. In agreement with P. Chatzidakis, sampling will be carried out in 2006 in order to identify the character- istics of the pink, mauve and violet colours, derived from an organic colorant. Pending permission from the Ephorate, a BCH publication of the results co- authored by A. Karydas and H. Brekoulaki is envis- aged. Sampling regarding the micro-stratigraphy of pictorial layers as well as the application technique of gold leaves on marble is also planned.' Sarapeion C. H. Siard reports on the 2004 excavation and study season: 'N. Badoud (Bordeaux III and Neuchaitel, Switzerland) continued the study of amphora stamps discovered in recent campaigns. Five new trenches (IX-XIII) were opened (Fig. 141). Trench IX corresponds to the entire cella, except its previously excavated NW comer. Under mod. concrete lay 0.37m of soil left from the 1910 excavations, beneath which there was a fill of rubble and fragments of large worked granite blocks originally belonging to the peripheral walls of the building. This fill has a d. of 2.63m and became muddier towards the bottom, due to proximity to the water level. The walls were built directly on bedrock, and then the granite was cut for the digging of a well. Apart from a few fragments of amphorae, mostly plain pottery was found, mainly along the walls; a significant quantity of tiles and pieces of hydraulic mortar was also collected. A trench in the vestibule (bedrock to the E at 36.40m asl) followed. Several fills connected with the building were found. We have been able to verify that the partition wall was continuous for the entire w. of the building. In the vestibule, this wall served as a foundation, not meant to be visible. The vestibule and the cella appear to be contemporaneous: the foundations of the partition wall are connected to those of the walls to the E and W of the pronaos. We were able to con- firm the chronological indications provided by trenches V and VII in 2001 and 2002: the ceramic material associated with the construction of the building dates it to the second half of the 2 Ct BC. The pottery from the pronaos appears to belong to the same period. The absence of traces of a roof and the poor state of the walls prevent a hypothetical reconstruction. The walls preserve no openings but it is necessary to suppose that there was a door, or 141 Delos, Serapeion: general plan</page><page sequence="94">94 JAMES WHITLEY that the wall was relatively low, in order to allow the water to/from the vestibule to the N. The numerous tiles found indi- cate that at least part of this well was covered (maybe only the vestibule), and the abundance of big granite blocks suggests that the walls reached a considerable h. Inscriptions, and comparison with the two small Sarapieia A and B, had already indicated that hydraulic works existed in Sarapieion C. It is now clear that 'temple C', should actually be regarded as a vast well built and drilled into the bedrock (sup- plied by the water-table). This well was preceded by a proba- bly covered vestibule. Among the lists of subscriptors, dated to the beginning of the 1 Ct, some concern the construction of a hydreion (a water reservoir). The mention of building material (litheia) (ID 2620) indicates that this hydreion was a building, possibly to be identified with the well in 'temple C'. In Sarapieion C two dedications mention a god Hydreios/Hydreion. In one dedication, he is termed Epekoos ('who listens'). The other dedication mentioning him is that from the alley of the sphinxes (ID 2087, 2088), dedicated by a melanephoros to Sarapis, Isis, Anubis, Harpocrates and Hydreios. As the alley of the sphinxes runs towards 'temple C', this, and the fact that both structures have 1 Ct BC dates, fur- ther supports the identification of the hydreion. Trench X. A second trench was opened in the area between the E wall of the alley of the sphinxes and the E terrace. A vis- ible alignment of small blocks (W wall), suggested by R. Vallois to be the remains of the Escharon of the sanctuary of the Great Mother (mentioned in the Accounts of Independence and in the Athenian Inventories) turned out to rest on soil without a proper foundation. The excavation, down to bedrock, revealed 2 Ct material, as well as the possible foundation of a levelled wall to the E. The badly built irregular walls found do not indi- cate a substantial structure; thus, Vallois' suggestion can be dis- missed. Trench XI, S extension, and trench XII. Two trenches were opened in the E counter-alley of the alley of the sphinxes, near a levelled construction, the N and E walls of which were par- tially visible before excavation: the N wall perpendicular to the counter-alley; the E wall lay under the foundations of the ter- race, to the E of the counter-alley (XI: in the angle formed by these two walls; XII: against the N face of the perpendicular wall). The discovered remains can be dated to a period before the present organization of the S terrace of the Sarapieion: the excavated building witnessed at least two phases before aban- donment. During its first phase the building had a rectangular plan (4.70m 1., 3m w., wall w. 0.45m-0.50m), but it is not known whether it was roofed or not; also, its use remains unclear. The E half of the walls was founded on the granite bedrock, where- as the W half rests on a fill. One metre from its NW comer, the W wall was very low, probably indicating a door. In the E half of the building, bedrock was found at 37.40m asl. The internal face of the N wall was decorated, and thus intended to be visi- ble, while the small blocks of its external face are irregular, interpreted here as a foundation. Pottery from underneath the foundation, notably on the W side, dates the first building phase to the 4 or the 3 Ct BC, preceding the 1 Ct BC alley of the sphinxes and possibly Sarapieion C. In a second phase, two other walls were constructed against the internal faces of the S and W walls, reducing the internal space in size . Surviving in one to two courses, they rest directly on bedrock in the E half of the trench, but in the W half sit on a fill providing a tpq (2 Ct BC) for the restructuring, the reasons for which remain unclear. The first phase cannot be clearly dated. A layer of ashes, associated with the walls of the second ments of vegetable charcoals, seeds and fruits. The material appears comparable with that from the altar excavated in 2001/2002 in the S of the terrace. Pending further study, we suggest the structure is a hollow altar, an eschara. We also suppose, without decisive proof, that the altar belonged to the Isiac deities. It was already possible to suppose the existence of sacrificial practises from a quote in the Athenian inventories (ID 1417, A, II, 36-37). Hel material and bronze coins are associated with the con- struction of the altar, which must predate the last phase of Sarapieion C, since the foundations of the wall of the alley of the sphinxes leaned against its W wall and the wall of the E ter- race passes above its E wall. Its abandonment appears to be connected with the construction of the alley of the sphinxes and/or the construction of the E terrace since the fills covering it were associated with those structures. Thus, we suggest for this altar a date between the E2 Ct BC, the date of the founda- tion of the Serapieion, and the El Ct BC, the date of the dedi- cation of the alley of the sphinxes. Trench XI also offered the opportunity to examine the foun- dations of the E wall of the alley of the sphinxes and to confirm the observations, to the S of the alley, of the site of a trench probably dug in 1910. Trench XIII. A long trench was opened to the E of the Sarapieion, behind the E peribolos wall which exhibits, at its N extremity, and for a 1. of 4m, a gap in the masonry attesting to the existence of a large opening; this aperture was also includ- ed in the Sv. Risom plan. It had been replaced by a narrower opening (ca 1.50m) with a gneiss doorstep still in situ. Prior to the beginning of the excavation we observed, parallel to the E wall of the Sarapieion, the crests of two walls: the first (median wall) is 4.40m from the wall of the Sarapieion; the second is 8m to the E. In the E half of the trench under the arable soil at a 45.40m asl we encountered a compact layer, with sherds laid flat, sug- gesting a street of packed earth and bordering the terrace of the foreign gods to the E. Its fill contained mostly cw sherds. Excavation then concentrated in the W half of the trench, between the median wall and the wall of the Sarapieion. Under the arable layer we encountered a destruction layer (0.60m d.) containing small blocks apparently fallen from the median wall. We collected at level 44.85m asl many fragments of a mosaic made of marble tesserae, mixed with loose earth and many stones. Only the mosaic undercoat, of mortar, had remained in situ at 44.40m asl. The fill between the mortar layer and the bedrock contained bones and abundant pottery. These results suggest that the limits of Sarapieion C need to be reconsidered. The large opening behind chapel H did not, as suggested by Roussel, open directly onto the street, but led to a mosaic floored room of the sanctuary, which may have been damaged after the opening of the large door, but continued in use. The inclusion of this room, bordering the peribolos wall to the N and E, increases the temenos by 4.4m to the E. The room's S limit, and whether it had an E access remains unclear; tile fragments indicate that it was roofed (a supplementary chamber of the Serapieion?). In general, several corrections can now be made to the older (Sv. Risom) plans of Sarapieion C. The complex took its pres- ent shape, at the earliest, in the second half of the 2 Ct, when the construction of the S terrace, the S and W retaining walls of the esplanade, the propylon, the shops opening on the W street below the terrace, the alley of the sphinxes and 'temple C' occurred. However, there is evidence that more anc. construc- tions possibly preceded it, indicating an early spread of the Delian sanctuary to the S. The earlier structures are all located</page><page sequence="95">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 95 where it was possible to build directly onto the granite, before any retaining element existed to the W. Results derived from these trenches have also forced us to alter radically our attitude towards texts concerning the Sarapieion, in particular the Accounts of Independence and the Athenian Inventories. These texts, frequently used as guides to identify the discovered remains, have all been proven to be of a later date; archaeological evidence does not allow us to identi- fy them in texts earlier than the mid-2 Ct BC. It is, therefore, necessary to examine the testimony of other documents, such as the dedications and subscription lists (building accounts), most- ly dated to the end of the 2-E 1 Ct BC. It will be always possi- ble to recognize isolated buildings through the texts (temple F probably is the temple of Sarapis mentioned by the administra- tors, since there is no evidence to suggest a construction date prior to the beginning of the 2 Ct), but for the purposes of gen- eral topography they should not be trusted. F. Muller completed the drawing of rooms situated to the W, below the N court of the sanctuary. These rooms were thought by Roussel to be underground rooms belonging to the Sarapieion, which now seems doubtful. Some of them were back-filled, at the time of the construction of the L-shaped porch, and integrated into that building. A schematic plan showing their architectural evolution has been completed. Our work also represented an opportunity to reconsider and to con- clude the study of the L-shaped porch. We also studied the con- structions situated to the E of the N court, and other parts of the Isis chapel. Its facade has been drawn. The plan of all the structures situated on this terrace has been completed.' M.-Fr. Billot continued, in 2004, his studies of the architectural terracottas in the Museum and on site (Fig. 142): 'In the museum, varied material from the insula of the House of the Comedians was studied and classified. Two sets of ante- fixes and multiple fragments of simas were studied for joins, position and polychromy. The origin of the moulds of the simas and antefix decoration, as well as the manufacture is incon- testably Athenian (identical decorations in the Keramikos of Athens). It appears that the insulae of the Bronzes and that of the Jewels were roofed similarly to that of the House of the Comedians. On site, a few new deposits of tiles have been found and sorted, e.g., over 3,000 fragments from the House of the Seals. J.-C1. Moretti (Centre National de Recherches Scientifiques) reports on the Atlas, the drafting of a detailed and up-to-date general topographical plan of Delos, the two Rhevmatiaris and of the anc. and mod. structures on the island, based on digitized plans, GPS and photogrammetry.

Meyza (Polish Academy of Sciences): 'Work focused on technical aspects of the production of E Sigillata A type pottery produced in Syria-Palestine. Technical observations and the stamps should allow the establishment of relations between pottery from the same workshops. Of the 335 vases and fragments inventoried in the House of the Jewels, only one ESA type vase (shape 29) is of the Augustean period. All others belong to the LHel period, and a predominance of plates in relation to bowls is observed. The closed shapes are very rare. The same chronology is also valid for the Pergamenian material, but the variety of the shapes is greater.' - - - 142 Delos: architectural terracottas Sanctuary of the Archegesion. F.

Sarian (University of So Paulo, Brazil) reports on the 2004 study season: 'The study of the Cyc pottery (73 items) found in the votive deposit of the Heraion by P. Roussel in 1911 and published by Ch. Dugas in 1928 was completed. As regards this material, eighteen items belong to the Geo Cyc category, 55 pieces are of the Cyc orientalising group (originally of Naxos, Paros and, probably, Thera and Crete). Additionally, the material from the trenches excavated by P. Bernard in 1953 and 1958 (166 pieces) was washed, catalogued, photographed and studied. This unpublished material includes a high proportion of Geo and ori- entalising sherds (from the Cyclades and E Greece) and some Cor and Attic fragments. The material from the trench dug by J. Ducat in 1964 (160 sherds), also unpublished, belongs more or less to the same categories. My own trenches of 2002 yielded, among other results, a great deal of Hel pottery suggesting a continuity of cult until the Hel period, a point previously only indicated by some inscrip- tions from Delos. From a total of 900 numbered fragments, 168 characteristic pieces have been analysed and studied.' Paros Paroikia. G. Kouragios and S. Detoratou (ADelt, 791-95) report on excavations and restoration in five different locations revealing evidence of occupation from the Ar to the PostByz period. At Chardavellas plot, situated outside the anc. city walls, two Rom cist graves were excavated, one containing three burials, the other five. Finds include glass perfume flasks, bronze coins, iron nails and a golden earring with added glass. At Agios Panteleimon (Alifieris plot, next to Orphanidis plot, where a public building or open sanctuary is found), where LHel-Rom graves had been located, excavation continued and revealed five cist graves and a rock-cut grave dating to the Rom period; marble architectural elements from Ar and Cl buildings were also used for their construction. Finds include perfume flasks, clay vessels, a bone spoon, bone pins, a bronze mirror, bone spherical pierced objects, gold earrings, gold straps, a silver pendant, bronze coins, an iron scraper, the frag- ment of a lamp, iron nails and a clay plate. Also retrieved was a fragment of a large marble relief plaque of the C1 period</page><page sequence="96">96 JAMES WHITLEY showing a standing female figure, probably part of the decora- tion of a large temple. Finally, a circular monument resem- bling the Ar burial monument of Theagenis in Thasos was excavated near the graves. The walls were founded on the bedrock and the foundations are associated with quantities of Ar pottery. There are associated inscriptions, such as KANQN and AHAOA, along with sketches of phallic symbols, miniature houses and footprints. The finds include a clay PostByz drain, which probably brought water from the mountain of Agios Anargyros to the city of Paroikia. At the Sanctuary of Asklepios and Apollo Pythios cleaning and restoration of the 4 Ct sanctuary took place. During the works, part of a marble ashlar block was retrieved with a sculpted seated female figure on one side, and a standing female figure on another, probably a representation of Artemis. The figures date either to the first or second quarter of the 6 Ct. At Krios the LRom apsidal building located at the beach opposite Paroikia was also cleaned and restored. The outline of the building is revealed, but the interior is not excavated; its interpretation is open to dis- cussion.

More than 1,800 enchytris- moi of infants have been uncovered, dating from LGeo to Rom times. The varied provenance of the burial jars and the sheer number of infant burials add to the significance of the site, which is cautiously interpreted by archaeologists as a sanctu- ary of Artemis Locheia or a famous obstetrician's practice. The skeletal material is studied by S. Hillson and his team (University College London). Chora. E.

Karatzali and Ch. Stratou (ADelt, 942-44) report the following. At O. Michail Petridi (Manousou plot) nine LHel rock-cut tombs were inves- tigated (eight rectangular shaft graves and one chamber tomb, dimensions vary: 2-2.60m 1., 0.80-1.30m w.). Most tombs were plundered and empty, with the exception of tomb 7, which con- tained bones of a skeleton and grave goods (four plates, nine conical bowls and one bs perfume flask. At O. Kamirou (Diakogeorgiou plot) nine tombs were identified. Two were of rectangular shape, partly built and partly rock-cut, one pre- served the cover slabs and contained multiple burials and one perfume flask (1 Ct BC-1 Ct AD) and one was a rectangular built chest which contained an inscribed urn with remains of a cremation and a Rhodian type glass bowl (first half of 1 Ct BC- first half of 1 Ct AD). The rest of the tombs were found almost empty, disturbed and backfilled. At O. Parthenopis (Tsimpidakis plot) nine rectangular rock-cut shaft graves and two rock-cut chests were investigated (dimensions vary: 1.40- 2.70m 1., 0.40-1.34m w.). Bones and grave goods were found disturbed, as the tombs were plundered. Grave goods include fourteen LHel perfume vases, fragments of transport amphorae, two plates, ten bowls, lamps (3 Ct BC), a bs 'guttus type' askos (3 Ct BC), a female figurine, a burial kalpis with lid, a Rhodian pyxis, fragments of a bronze pin and lead sheet. Two fragments of stelae were also found during the excavation of the plot. Central cemetery. E. Kaninia, E. Karatzali and P. Triandaphyllidis (ADelt, 944-46) report the following. At the junction of K. Hydraiou and Mytilinis (Toutsi-Zervou plot) in the E sector thirteen LCl shaft tombs and seven chests with remains of burial urns were investigated. In the W sector the excavation uncovered six rock-cut and partly built LC1 shaft tombs, two similar tombs and five chests (one rock-cut and four built) dating to the second half of the 3 Ct BC. Tomb 16 con- tained a female(?) skeleton and a variety of grave goods (L4 Ct- M3 Ct BC): two small transport jars, an iron dagger blade, a bronze mirror, a bs lamp, a small lead pyxis with lid, bone and glass beads and a silver coin found near the mouth. In tomb 15 three clay leaf-shaped objects were found (components of a game, a tool or a loom?). At O. K. Hydraiou (loannidou plot) 45 rectangular rock-cut shaft tombs were investigated. Four tombs preserved the cover slabs. The cemetery was used dur- ing two periods: L4 Ct-E3 Ct BC and L3 Ct-E2 Ct BC. The tombs had been disturbed. Among the earlier period finds there are bs kalyx cups, bs kylikes and hydria, Rhodian pyxides and fragments of kraters. Later period finds include transport jars, bowls, plates, perfume flasks and jugs. Moreover, special men- tion is made to two stone alabastra, a bull figurine, fragments of human figurines and a few bronze grave goods. During works at the Rhodes-Lindos road a built cist grave was investigated. On the white plastered floor a 3 Ct BC miniature hydria was found. E cemetery. E. Karatzali and Ch. Phantaoutsaki (ADelt, 946-50) report that at O. Filerimou (Nikolidakis plot) two groups of Hel rock-cut rectangular tombs, placed between three rock-cut spaces, were investigated. At the N sector four plun- dered twin rock-cut rectangular tombs were found. Tomb 6 contained two fragmentary bowls and an urn, a hydria, with cre- mated bones and an iron ring. In the S sector a group of four series of twin and triple shaft graves were found. Sparse grave goods date to the end of 3 Ct-2 Ct BC. At the E sector a later wall was traced and fourteen perfume flasks were found, possi- bly originally belonging to the plundered tombs. Special refer- ence is made to a fragment of a grave stele with relief decora- tion of two men, the upper part of an inscribed stele (AIOKAHX AAIKAPNA1EEYI), a fragment of another inscribed grave stele (MATPOAMPOX EBEXIOL) and other sparse architectural parts. At Korakonerou plot a group of LHel rock-cut rectangu- lar chests was excavated. The intact chests contained osteothekes with cremations. One contained three inscribed osteothekes and a kalpis with cremations, and a small ellipsoid lamax with the burial of an infant. Special mention is made to the identification of a red substance traced on the cremated bones in two urns. This is probably what remains from a red cloth, while in one case the cloth must have been bichrome, red and white, as remains of a thin white cloth were preserved on the surface of the bones. Other important finds include two stone alabastra, two silver bowls, a bronze mirror and bone and clay gold-plated beads. A group of the chests was probably covered by a large built rectangular structure. At the southern sector of the plot four funerary hydriae with cremations were found, and nearby a simple inhumation was excavated. N.

The visible part of the W fagade of the building is estimated to be 16.20m in 1., while the maximum visible perimeter of the building is estimated to be 57m in 1. The interior of the building is divided in to eight areas, includ- ing a polythyron structure with a slabbed floor dating to the ulti- mate building phase of LLM IA, a room with two doors and a storage area with three fragmentary pithoi. It is noted that the earlier building extends to the S and W of the ashlar building; a destruction layer was identified, containing pottery and frag- ments of wall paintings of ELM IA date. At the area to the W of the ashlar building more building remains of E and LLM IA phases were uncovered. The removal of the tephra layer under the LM IB/LH IIA-IIIA walls revealed a MBA deposit of large pebbles and pottery fragments.

An inter- national team of specialists included I. Bradfer-Burdet, T.F. Cunningham, J.M. Driessen, S.A. Hemingway, C.J. Knappett, C.F. Macdonald, J.A. MacGillivray, L.H. Sackett and I. Schoep.

First, the early stages of the NeoPalatial period have been more thoroughly analysed than before by Knappett and Cunningham. For three rich deposits they present the full range of cw and plain wares, in addition to the superficially more diagnostic (but also mislead- ing) fine painted wares, and as a result have been able to distin- guish clearly between MM IIIB and LM IA products and deposits. Second, building 1 (like buildings 3 and 7) has pro- duced evidence for LM II activity, and one LM II floor deposit has been identified there. It now remains to relate these to the burnt destruction deposits in the adjacent building 4, which are of LM IB character but contain LM II fine ware imported from central Crete, and perhaps the beginnings of the local LM II styles as well. One chronological implication is that there was a time lag between LM IB destructions in central and E Crete, a conclusion already formed at other sites, like Mochlos. This might suggest a time-lag sufficient for some local LM II char- acteristics to have already developed. Third, the study of build- ing l's LM IIIB shrine complex is of special interest, because of the rarity of LM IIIB material at Palaikastro (in the past rated as 'absent'). The shrine complex includes out-buildings (for workshops and perhaps animal husbandry), which in some cases extend outside the original limits of the NeoPalatial build- ing. A similar situation exists at building 3, where study in 2003-2004 concentrated on the quite widely spread LM IIIB material. This extends outside the original building's S fagade, and a question arises as to its relationship with the central shrine of building 1. The building 1 shrine is 'central' to areas of con- temporary activity, which extend to the N (workshops), to the S (building 3 and beyond) and to the W by connecting stone steps to a L shrine over building 4, rooms 13-14. Possibly further structures, now lost, also existed over the eroded NeoPalatial rooms at the E. Zakros. S. Chrysoulaki (Ministry of Culture) reports (ADelt 53[1998], 882) on the 1998 study season for the guard house at Choiromandres. The last phase of systematic occupation of the building dates to LM IB, whereas earlier levels contained 149 Zakros, Choiromandres, pottery: LM IA (left) and LM IB (right) MM II and MM III-LM IA pottery. There is no evidence to support the theory that the building was suddenly destroyed, instead abandonment and gradual decay seems to have taken place in LM IB (Fig. 149). She also reports (ADelt 53 [1998], 882-83) on the survey conducted at the small plato of Ambeles Kato Zakrou. In addi- tion to the known megalithic structure, a smaller building was located nearby. A system of peribolos walls was located asso- ciated with Old Palace period pottery. Finally a small limestone quarry and traces of a M road were located. L. Platon (University of Athens, Archaeological Society of Athens) reports (Ergon [2004], 58-59) on the 2004 study season which concentrated on the conservation of all the ceramic mate- rial from house B located on the NW part of the hill surround- ing the palace. Cleaning work continued at the so-called 'Old Palace period building'; it was confirmed that the entrance to room B marked on the older plan does not exist. DEMOS SITEIAS Siteia. V. Apostolakou (24 EPCA) reports (ADelt 53 [1998], 877) on work conducted at Siteia Museum. The newspaper Ethnos (28/8/2004) reports the discovery of a 1.5m 1. tusk of a PH elephant; excavation work was super- vised by geologist C. Fasoulas of the Museum of Natural History. Praisos. J. Whitley (Director, BSA) reports on the 2004 study season, principally devoted to drawing: 'Although the principal objective was to complete the draw- ings, re-examination of a number of finds forced us to modify conclusions reached in earlier seasons. The fine ware pottery from site 46 seems to be slightly earlier than previously thought (MM Ib-MM IIa). One cup (346.6.38) with white-on-dark dec- oration has a petalloid loop with a red/orange dot. This pro- vides a firm terminus for the resumption of settlement in the area in the Old Palace period. There are also more signs of NeoPalatial occupation. Two MM III-LM Ib white-on-dark fine ware sherds were identified from two locations either close to (site 52) or on Praisos itself. These finds in turn prompt a re- consideration of our dating of sites through tripod leg typology. Comparanda from Mochlos and Palaikastro suggest that Betancourt's 'Kommos sequence' of tripod legs, where 'thin ovals (MM I-MM III) are followed by 'thick ovals' (MM III- LM I) and then round tripod legs, also applies to the Siteia peninsula in general and our survey area in particular. Our 'thick ovals' are thus likely to be NeoPalatial in date, which implies that NeoPalatial occupation/activity was more extensive than we had earlier suggested. Comparanda from Palaikastro, Roussolakkos also suggests that the incised 'herringbone' style of decorated cws is already well established by LM IIIB, if not</page><page sequence="102">102 JAMES WHITLEY 150 Mochlos, building B2: tin ingot and bronze trident in situ earlier. Re-occupation of site 40 (the refuge settlement at Kypia above Kalamafki) may then be earlier than we thought. Drawing encourages close inspection of objects, and renewed study of the votive terracottas from the sanctuaries also brought some new observations. For one thing, the CI-Hel nude youth seems to have a 'contraposto' pose, and examples of this type are found at the 'Spring at Vavelloi' as well as the votive deposit on the I acropolis. Second, more of the types described by Forster and Halbherr were identified (an Ar griffin from the 'Spring at Vavelloi', a CI-Hel draped female figure from T843). Third, much of the material appears to be stylisti- cally much later than the 'daedalic' period in Crete and fits comfortably into the 6 Ct. This is in accord with Brice Erickson's dating of our cup bases from site 14 (Prophitis Ilias) and Praisos itself. Our sequence of cup bases is likely to be continuous. There is no 'Archaic gap' at Praisos. Mochlos. The following volume has been published: J.S. Soles et al., Mochlos IC: Period III. NeoPalatial Settlement on the Coast: the Artisan's Quarter and the Farmhouse at Chalinomouri. the Small Finds (Philadelphia, INSTAP Academic Press, 2004). J. Soles (ASCSA) and K. Davaras (24 EPCA and University of Athens) report (ADelt 53 [1998], 887) on the 1998 study sea- son already reported in AR 45 (1999), 120. They also report on the resumed excavations at Mochlos for 2004: 'The current excavation has two main goals. One is to com- plete the excavation of LM I buildings that were incompletely excavated in the 1989-1994 seasons, and the other is to dig to bedrock in all parts of the BA settlement in order to document the sequence of occupation on the site more fully and expose as much of the PrePalatial settlement as possible. We made con- siderable progress toward these goals in the summer of 2004 and also made some sensational discoveries. One of the buildings needing further excavation was the ceremonial centre, building B.2. We had not uncovered its W facade completely or dug through all of its floor deposits. An LM III house, house F, sits on top of its NW side. We thought we had completed the excavation of this house in the earlier excavations, but to our surprise, as we dug along the W side of B.2, we found that it crosses the old M street that ran along this side of the building and extends farther to the W and S. It caused considerable damage to the old M building, and we may never fully understand how the M building looked in this area. We also dug in the SW wing of building B.2. Six large bronze basins were found here in 1994, and this part of the building appears to have been used for a drinking ceremony. Digging in a storeroom opposite the room where the basins were found, we uncovered three pithoi which had been buried beneath the floor level, probably to keep their contents cool. Only the rims and shoulders of the pithoi rose above the floor. An LM IB jug lay inside the innermost of these pithoi which had been filled with rocks. A tin ingot with a bronze trident (Fig. 150) placed over one comer of the ingot lay beneath this pithos at the bottom of the pit that had been dug out of the room when the pithoi were put in place. It had been largely trans- formed to a powdery, non-metallic tin (gray tin) by a complex change in its crystalline structure, and it was only recognized as tin after testing by laser induced breakdown spectrometry at INSTAPEC. The same conversion would also have rendered it shapeless had it not been surrounded by the earth that was used to re-bury the pithoi above it; it lay at the bottom of the pit and formed a pocket of powdery material that preserved the original shape of the ingot. After the removal of the tin, a plaster cast was made of this pocket which reproduces the original shape of the ingot. With two straight sides, joining at a right angle, and an irregular line opposite, it bears a remarkable resemblance to a tin ingot found on the Uluburun shipwreck. The trident also resembles one from the Uluburun ship, but unlike that trident which was being used to fish, the Mochlos trident was intact and served as a symbol of power. Both trident and tin ingot probably came to Mochlos from a ship very like the Uluburun ship that set out from the Syrian coast and made its way to Crete without mishap some 200 years earlier. We also continued excavating the floor deposit in the SW pillar crypt of the ceremonial building. In previous seasons, we had found only pithoi here and conical cups. We continued to find many more conical cups this summer, but also a whole, intact ox-hide ingot. It lay on the floor directly beneath the win- dow in the E faqade of the pillar crypt and must have been illu- minated by this window and visible to passers by on the street outside. A conical cup was placed upside down on top of the ingot. Mochlos joins Hagia Triadha and Zakros as one of the only sites in Crete to preserve a complete ingot. Beneath house C.3, which lies directly across the street from the main entrance to the ceremonial building, we had found the remains of a ProtoPalatial house in the earlier exca- vation. We hoped to find more of this MM house beneath an adjacent room of the LM I house, but instead came upon a pit that had been dug beneath the LM IB floor. It was located against the S wall of the room, which appears to have been an ordinary living room within the house, and extended ca 0.50m below the floor. It was designed to hold a large hoard of bronze objects, and was partially lined with stones and plaster and capped with a stone quern. The hoard resembles three other hoards found at Mochlos in the earlier excavations, including one in the same house, in that it held a mix of copper ingots and bronze objects, but differs from these in that most of the objects appear to have been still in use. Beneath the quern at the top of the pit lay half an ox-hide ingot weighing exactly 15kg. It was</page><page sequence="103">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 103 incised with a mark that also appears on a round bun ingot from the Uluburun ship, which the excavators of the Uluburun ship have identified as a ship's rudder. The mark is thought to have been incised on the ingot at the point of its receipt and export to the W and probably identifies ownership. It suggests that the Mochlos ingot came from the same location as the Uluburun ingot even though it predates it by many years. Ingots from Hagia Triadha also bear some of the same signs found on the Uluburun ingots, and if our interpretation of these marks is cor- rect, the same merchant families who were shipping ingots to Crete in 1300 BC were already established in 1500 BC. The ingot was placed at an angle against the adjacent wall and sheltered a bronze sistrum that lay immediately beneath it (Fig. 151). The sistrum belongs to a variety with a simple looped frame that was attached to a U-shaped support at the top of a handle. The frame was pierced at two points on each side to support two cross pins, the upper of which was provided with three small disks, the lower with two. When the instrument was shaken, these disks struck each other and the sides of the frame, and the cross pins also moved back and forth in the frame. It is said to have imitated the sound of the wind blowing through a papyrus grove. The sistrum was imported from Egypt, proba- bly on the same ship that brought the copper ingots to Mochlos, where it was a very old type of musical instrument, dating back to the Old Kingdom, and was used in the worship of the god- dess Hathor, whose head often appears at the top of the handle. Until now only seven other examples have been found in Crete, all clay models found in tombs at Archanes and Hagios Charalambos. They are likely to be M copies of bronze origi- nals which were also circulating in Crete, one of which is shown on the Hagia Triadha harvester's vase with exactly the same U-shaped handle attachment as the Mochlos example. The project continued to carry out an extensive water flota- tion programme in order to recover as large a sample of eco- factual material as possible. As in the earlier excavation, a 10% soil sample of all floor deposits and a 100% sample of many features such as hearths, dumps or pottery contents were set aside for water flotation. The programme yielded impressive results this summer and produced a large amount of floral and faunal material in addition to what was collected by hand. We were also able to begin a systematic organic residue analysis programme this summer. The earlier excavation had done some work along these lines using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry for the analysis of lipids preserved in LM I lamps and discovered that beeswax was used as fuel in these lamps. That study was conducted sometime after the excavation of the lamps, whereas our new programme is carried out during the course of the excavation on objects as soon as they are unearthed in order to assure that the organic residues that may have been preserved are not lost during the course of post-exca- vation exposure and handling. All finds are examined and sam- pled before going to conservation. As a result, we were able to make an exciting find in building C.7. This building, which we are still in the process of excavating, was a large complex used for manufacturing and agricultural production. In one room we found a LM I vat sitting in situ on a comer platform, resembling in this respect similar vats from Gournia and Vathypetro. Inspecting this vat for organic remains, we discovered a large number of small grape pips and skins still adhering to the bot- tom of the vat. Neither mineralized nor carbonized, they were preserved in an acidic potassium salt of tartaric acid. This acid forms naturally during the fermentation of grape juice into wine and crystallizes in wine casks. While the discoveries in the LM IB settlement were plenti- ful, they did not prevent us from proceeding with our second goal, namely the exploration of lower levels of occupation on 15 1 \1ochloS. houSc ('3 bronll/c Flgptitla istuIm the site. We were able to excavate to bedrock in several loca- tions and made a number of discoveries in the course of this work. One is that many of the LM IB houses appear to have been constructed only in the LM IA period. We were surprised by this finding since we had believed that they dated to an ear- lier phase of the NeoPalatial period. A second discovery was no surprise, however, and simply confirmed what we already knew. Most of the NeoPalatial houses suffered considerable damage at the end of the LM IA period and were reconstructed at the beginning of the LM IB period when ashlar sandstone masonry was introduced to the site. Perhaps the most dramatic evidence of this reconstruction was found in the same room as the bronze hoard in house C.3 where Santorini tephra, including a conical cup full of tephra, was found associated with the IA destruction debris. Only a little MM III and ProtoPalatial mate- rial was found in the excavations that we were able to carry out below the LM I houses. We did find some: part of a ProtoPalatial road beneath house C.3; a ProtoPalatial founda- tion deposit beneath C.7; and a MM III kitchen, rich in organic remains, beneath house D.5. For the most part, however, wher- ever we dug below LM I levels, we came directly upon PrePalatial remains of the 3 mill. BC. We had already exposed parts of three PrePalatial houses in the earlier excavation, PrePalatial house 1, which lies beneath house C.1, PrePalatial house 2, which lies beneath the ceremonial building, and PrePalatial house 3, which lies beneath the S side of building C.7. This summer we found a fourth, PrePalatial house 4, directly beneath the LM I floor deposits of house C.2, which is probably part of one that Seager excavated beneath the same house. All of these houses are extensive and may have formed a large closed settlement of the sort found at Myrtos, Fournou Koriphi. The picture of this settlement is by no means clear, however, and we hope to expose a lot more of it in the summer of 2005. Most of the floor deposits belonged to the EM IIB period and contained some examples of Vasilike ware. Only in the case of PrePalatial house 3 did we find much evidence for</page><page sequence="104">104 JAMES WHITLEY EM III, including walls of this date overlying earlier PrePalatial walls. The most exciting PrePalatial finds were made in house 2, beneath the SW wing of the ceremonial building, not far from the area where we found an intact EM II goblet in earlier exca- vations. A large deposit of intact, clay objects lay in a stone- lined bin at the NW comer of one room. Many of the objects were found in pairs; so, for example, there were two large tankards, two large plates, two tall pyxides, two jugs, two bowls and two clay boats. None of the objects were decorated, but a Vasilike ware sherd found with them suggests that they should be dated to the EM IIB phase. Why they were all placed togeth- er and what they mean is less clear. A secondary goal of the current project is to investigate his- torical PostBA remains on the island further in order to under- stand what was happening at Mochlos in these periods. To this end six new trenches were opened along the fortification wall that runs on the summit of the island. This wall is believed to date to the 4 Ct BC and to have been re-used in the Byz period. We discovered, however, that it cuts through walls of the 7 and 6 Cts BC, and a small settlement appears to have been located on the top of the island at this time. Pseira. The following volume has been published: P.P. Betancourt, C. Davaras, R. Hope Simpson (eds), Pseira VIII: The Pseira Island Survey Pt. 1 (Philadelphia, INSTAP Academic Press, 2004). DEMOS IERAPETRAS Chrysokamino. P. Betancourt (ASCSA) reports (ADelt 53 [1998], 888) on the 1998 excavation season already reported in AR 45 (1998-1999), 119. Kavousi. G.

Mook (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Iowa State University, ASCSA) report on the 2004 excavation season: 'The primary target areas of excavation were the W and S slopes of the S acropolis (areas A, B and D). The purpose of fieldwork was to finish excavating the rooms of the andreion complex on the upper W slope in order to elucidate the plan and function of the building and its associated structures; to contin- ue exploring the SW terraces where two buildings had come to light in 2003, where there were indications of preserved Final Neo and EIA remains, and where excavation had revealed details of the Ar (7 Ct BC) renovation and transformation of the EIA settlement; and finally to begin exploring the wide flat ter- race immediately S of the S slope houses which had seemed to be the likely location of the settlement's agora. After three seasons of work it is clear that the S acropolis was the E city's civic centre (6to E5 Ct BC), occupied exclu- sively by public buildings which are linked by concentric spine walls and ring roads converging in the wide S terrace. Work in 2004 has now established the essential form of the andreion, a series of rooms that extends across two terraces on the W slope: storage and food processing on the lower level in A1200, A1400, A1600 and A600, and ceremonial consumption on the upper level in A800, A1900 and A2000. The porch and vestibule (A1900) connect kitchen and dining areas and also appear to have separated and differentiated areas of consumption. The large open dining hall in A2000 was accessible directly from the porch, and both porch and vestibule were found to be littered with food and pottery debris, including fragments of small fen- estrated stands and various types of drinking vessels and kraters, evidently swept from adjacent halls during periodic cleaning of the building. Finds from the A2000 dining hall (studied and restored in 2003-2004) include a small pithos, as well as parts of several fine cups, kraters, table amphorae, an exaleiptron and a krater stand. This room appears to have been capable of seating a large number of people, functioning as a general dining room that served the routines of the syssitia, accommodating guests and agelai as well as formal members. The rooms to the N are accessible only through the vestibule via a narrow bedrock ramp. Between and connecting the vestibule and the room with the terracotta krater stands (A800, excavated in 2002), another room was recovered in the N area of A1900. Its special function is indicated by the presence of pavers in the centre of the room, and stone-built bases or plat- forms along the E side. Although the function of these plat- forms remains uncertain (possibly used to support stands or benches), the room has a more restricted access and specialized function than A2000, suggesting a segregation of participants in various activities of dining, drinking and libation. On the lower level of the andreion complex, excavation in trench A1600, initially begun in 2002, was completed down to floor level. A built bin with a pithos was found in the SE cor- ner, next to a smoothed round limestone work platform embed- ded in the floor. Around the work platform were found two quems, a large hand stone and a triton's trumpet shell, while on the N side of the room there were more querns, hand stones, shells, a kalathos with elbow-shaped handles and an E5 Ct lekythos, an Attic import, decorated in Six's technique, likely from the workshop of the Diosphos painter. The figures, a satyr pursuing a maenad, are executed in added white over a bs back- ground and interior details are done with incision; here the scene is framed by red bands. Other finds from the room include a considerable amount of food debris, a cylindrical ter- racotta krater stand (like the ones found in the adjoining store- rooms and dining halls), high-necked cups, skyphoi, a fine jug, chytrai (Fig. 152) and numerous small finds: a piece of embossed sheet bronze, a bronze finger ring, an iron ring, a number of spindle whorls and loom weights, an iron blade and a bronze pin. On the S slope of the S acropolis, the E branch of a wide N- S street was followed into the agora, where it runs along the E side of a monumental building. This two-room structure has a large main room (12 x 5.0m) with a rectangular cut-bedrock 152 Azoria, andreion kitchen: cup, skyphos, jug and chytrai</page><page sequence="105">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 105 platform in the centre, a wide hard-packed clay platform against the N wall and parts of stone built benches on the E and W sides. S of the bedrock platform in the middle of the room, a stone-lined pit supported a large upright terracotta amphora with an evenly broken bottom forming a rhyton-like installa- tion. The imported amphora (probably Cyc), preserved to its shoulder, protruded well above the level of the floor. Goat bones were found in the fill within the vessel, three lower legs and feet and cranial fragments of a single butchered animal of prime meat age. While there was no evidence of burning on the bones, the assemblage (the non-meaty lower legs, feet and cra- nial elements) is not inconsistent with remains of sacrifice. Save for this modified amphora, there were few finds that could indicate the function of this building. A fragmentary terracotta votive plaque, however, was recovered in the NW area, illus- trating a male figure with a club or sword, facing the arched back of another figure, perhaps an animal. The building remains a mystery, owing principally to its poor state of preser- vation, but the evidence so far suggests a heroon. Excavation continued in areas along the SW terrace, W of the agora, where in 2003 a large kitchen (B 1500) and storeroom (B700) had come to light. It now seems that these rooms form not part of a house, as originally reported, but of a series of con- nected and centralized food preparation and storage areas. In 2004, an interesting bone deposit came to light at the S edge of this complex in B 1700. The mandibles of at least twenty goats (prime meat age animals) were found placed in a small, restrict- ed area bordered by a rough two-course retaining wall built on a dirt surface. This deposit is unusual in that it consisted of only disarticulated, but unmodified left and right mandibles. No other goat bones, cranial or post-cranial, or other food debris was found in the area. In addition, they lay in the same hori- zontal plane, clustered in a small area on the ground surface, indicating that they had been deposited in a single event; care- fully removed from the carcasses, collected and deposited. A possible explanation is that these elements were used formally to prove age, number and condition of animals supplied for din- ing in the nearby public buildings. Excavation N of B1500, followed a doorway and steps which were found to lead N into another spacious kitchen with a large rectangular stone lined hearth in the centre (B2200- 2300). The room's E wall curves NW with the natural contours of the hill, creating an oddly shaped narrowed N end. A pithos and part of a transport amphora were recovered in the SE cor- ner of the room E of the doorway. Among the other finds there was a lekane, iron spit socket, a quern, two whetstones, two schist pot lids, a bar-handled kalathos, a number of pecked and abraded pebbles and pieces of pumice, three spindle whorls and some sixteen perforated metacarpals and metatarsals (that is, the lower leg bones of sheep or goat) which may have func- tioned as loom weights or bobbins (gaitania), implements prob- ably used in braiding straps or decorations for textiles. The loom weights, whorls and bobbins were found clustered along the S side of the room, several very near the S wall, perhaps indicating the presence of a loom. On the N side of the room were several joining fragments of a large fenestrated terracotta krater stand and on the W, part of a bronze tripod (Fig. 153). The bronze piece has one leg pre- served, a lion's paw, and the rim is decorated with a row of incised pendent arcaded tongues below a band of convex ele- ments (half barrels). Above the leg there is a register with a row of incised chevrons between two circle bands above yet another series of arcaded tongues. The leg is hollow and an aperture in the base above the leg may have been a fitting or socket for an attachment of some kind. The fenestrated stands and bronze tri- pod indicate ceremonial and elite drinking equipment. These two connected kitchens, each with a large central rectilinear hearth and adjoining storerooms, might be evidence of central- ized and large-scale food processing and meal preparation asso- ciated with the civic installations to the N in D300 and D500. Adjacent to the kitchens on the N, excavations revealed a large storeroom (unexcavated), a small olive-press room (D300) and a monumental structure (D500) that has a S wall extending for some 8m from W-E where it forms a comer, turn- ing N for about 20m. A narrow test trench was excavated at the S end of this enormous building, exposing a section of floor. The building's interior has an even and hard-packed clay sur- face and a double row of dressed limestone steps running along the base of both S and E walls. The narrow trench revealed a deep layer of burned ceiling debris which contained large amounts of ash and carbon, evidently remains of fallen roof beams and other elements of the building's flat-roof superstruc- ture. On the floor itself were found a deep plain coarse bucket (situla), a fine painted lekane, a large number of burnt animal bones, including meat bones of pigs, rabbit, sheep and goat, cow, and top shells. Although the function of this building remains uncertain, the size (at least 180m2), internal refine- ments such as the interior rows of ashlars forming stepped seats, the use of megalithic construction (large boulders) in the S wall, the dense food debris and serving vessels, and the building's proximity to the kitchens and storerooms on the SW terrace all point to a formal civic function associated with public dining. Excavation in a series of sondages along the SW terrace exposed Final Neo walls forming parts of three separate build- ings. The northernmost Final Neo structure (building 1) has, on the outside, two dolomite cobble paved surfaces forming rec- tangular (ca 0.7m by 0.9m) platforms. Above the platforms, a terracotta anthropomorphic bird-headed figurine was recov- ered. E of the wall, within interior space, there was a pit con- taining a fragmentary pot full of pig bones. Neither the bones nor the pot appear to have been burned, but around the vessel was dark ashy soil and carbon, suggesting to the excavator the location of a pit hearth. The bones found in the pot indicate a single, juvenile animal, between twelve and 24 months in age. The presence of a number of articulated limb elements, plus vertebrae, suggests that a whole animal was butchered, then placed in the pot, with some of the meaty elements removed fol- lowing cooking. The Final Neo remains so far excavated on the SW terrace indicate three separate structures: building 1 on the N with the kitchen and platforms; building 2 on the S, separated from the N building by an alley, and containing two small rooms; and building 3 on the W, represented by a single wall, presumably the E edge of a room yet unexcavated. The form of the settle- ment indicates distinct architectural units in an open settlement I 53 /.\oritt: broln/ ctripod tfrtglmlcnt</page><page sequence="106">106 JAMES WHITLEY plan: individual buildings separated by alleys and courtyards instead of the agglomerative arrangement typical of BA spatial organization.

In fact, the SE angle of the building was never discovered and represented some- thing of a hiatus. Cleaning operations took place starting at the highest layers of soil which covered the crest of the walls and, in this way, dismantling the broken stones and rubble left by previous excavations. Many fragments of stone (millstones, ironworks, floats) have been discovered on the surface and inventoried; pottery finds were not significant. The plan, how- ever, reveals an interesting configuration: we have not discov- ered any angular blocks, although the departing of a perpendi- cular wall seemed to appear in the E wall. It seems, therefore, that the limits of the Epsilon Alpha house were further to the E. Inside the building, the discovered walls form two rectangular rooms; their function cannot be established without a more exhaustive excavation.' Epsilon Beta house. V. Stiirmer (Humboldt University of Berlin) reports on the 2004 study season: 'The Epsilon Beta house represents, at the moment, an opportunity to understand a ProtoPalatial building, i.e., a contemporary of the Mu area, and as well preserved. In fact, even though this house has been only partially explored, the structures which have been brought to light (like the light-well associated with a separate paving of red [mosaiko] coating, which represents red rectangles on a white ground, or a staircase coated and painted in red) testify to the existence of other structures with elaborate architecture in Malia in this period. The publication will include the architec- tural survey, the study of both the pottery and the ProtoPalatial stone vases and a presentation of the two floors which have been discovered.' Area N E of the palace. P. Darcque and M. Schmid report on the 2004 study season at the area NE of the palace where one MM II and three NeoPalatial phases were discovered. Malia Archaeological Survey. R. Laffineur and S. Miiller Celka report on the 2004 study season: 'Study of the Rom pot- tery (A. Kelly) is almost finished, materials from the sites of the plain from the PrePalatial (Y. Papadatos), NeoPalatial (D. Puglisi) and PostPalatial (J. Zurbach) have been examined, with the exclusion of material from archaeological zone A. B. Moulin carried out the verification of the drawings of stone tools and focused his attention on a problematic category of tools (decorated with negative prints of cylindrical abductions or 'carottes') in green stone. Surveys of the sandstone quarries were carried out. Thanks to this campaign we were able to com- plete the survey, started in 2002, of two whole areas; the 'Potamos' quarry (site 93.1), on the beach of the mill; and the 'Pyrgos' quarry (site 99), between the archaeological site and the mod. village. Some structures which had been cut into the massif of ammouda, situated to the W end of the beach of the mill, turned out not to belong to an anc. Quarry, but to be, in all probability, a Med installation containing a wheel mill which would have preceded the windmill built on the top of the mound afterwards. The violent wind storms which swept the beaches during the winter of 2003-2004 disturbed the sand to such an extent that the massifs of ammouda, situated about 20m behind the beach, which were hardly visible at surface last year, could be seen clearly for the first time. These massifs, little or not at all exposed to marine erosion, have retained traces of exploita- tion which are of an astonishing freshness. Their position makes them more susceptible to having been exploited at a more recent date than the half-immersed massifs. Works car- ried out during this campaign confirmed the existence of two significant categories of traces of working, corresponding, in all probability, to two distinct phases of anc. exploitation. The first category of marks, mainly visible in quarry 99, con- sists of narrow grooves which follow an orthogonal network and indicate the removal of oblong blocks of quite a regular shape. These grooves actually correspond to the preparation work of the blocks to be detached, which means the delimita- tion of their upper face, once the upper layer was taken away. Several zones of quarry 99 show, in addition, traces which seem to be associated with the process of the detachment of the removed blocks. They are particularly visible on the S part of the massif of ammouda of quarry 99. Quarry 99 shows mainly the moment when a row of blocks had been removed and when the blocks of the following row or bed were only marked around</page><page sequence="108">108 JAMES WHITLEY 156 Malia: mason's mark in situ by grooves of little depth, whose digging had to continue in all probability. There are no remains of the quarry face, only the NW part of the quarry, towards the sea, keeps a low terracing of blocks on two to three levels. However, the series of marks, which was associated with the blocks removed from the extinct exploitation bed, allow us, for the first time in Malia, to propose a reconstruction of the process. The cleanest traces have been moulded. At the S part of quarry 99, at the bottom of some grooves, in several places at the quarry, some nails made of iron are still in situ (driven home); a point which would suggest, evi- dently, that this part of the quarry was not exploited in M times. These nails were driven in vertically, their heads show at the bottom of the grooves. Only one specimen was driven in at an oblique angle in the vertical partition of the groove, perhaps corresponding to the fish-bone-style scorings mentioned above. However, it is necessary to underline that the few sherds found in the anfractuosities of the massif of unexploited ammouda, which is immediately to the W and to the S of quarry 99, all belong to the M period, predominantly to the ProtoPalatial phase (MM II). The second extraction technique is quite different and is pre- dominantly evidenced in quarries 93.1 and 93.2. The modules of the blocks are, here, far more disparate, their shapes are rarely oblong, often trapezoidal or even comer-shaped and the grooves between the blocks are more often larger than those of quarry 99. The comer cuts are sometimes close to each other and create the impression, in some zones of the quarry, of a fan shape (previously observed in 2002). We do not here, it seems, have marks which are specifically connected to the detachment of the blocks by the use of levers. The cuts of trapezoidal blocks are especially visible in the S sector of quarry 93.1, not far from the mound of the mill. It is also necessary to mention the discovery of a circular basin, about 80cm in d. and 130cm in w., situated in an unexplored ammouda massif immediately to the E of quarry 93.1. A basin of the same type exists in quar- ry 80 (Hotel Malia Beach) and in that of Christ's islet (site 87), in reduced dimensions. The function of these structures is not yet clear but it is possible that they are related to fishing struc- tures which are subsequent to the exploitation of the quarries. We could also interpret several oblong racks dug in a bed of ammouda, today immersed, of quarry 93.1, as fishponds. Some sherds which have been found against the partitions of the grooves in the sectors damaged by wind during the winter of 2003-2004 allow us to date the use of the quarries of the beach of the mill to MM but some sherds could be dated to LM I. The date for the M exploitation of the quarry seems to be confirmed by the unexpected discovery of a masons's mark (Fig. 156), on the upper surface of an attached trapezoidal block, whose regular shape and straightforward engraving appear to have been made on purpose, even though the sign does not correspond to the 'quarry marks' of Malia catalogued by J.-P. Olivier ('Catalogue of the quarry marks', The Palace of Malia Vol. 2 [EtCret XXV], 175). The squared shape evokes the marks 'en rameau', but it lacks the usual median stem and it has only two oblique branches, whereas the 'rameaux' always have at least four branches. If this is in fact a quarry mark, it is the first to have been found in situ in a quarry. It offers the first confirmation that these marks are closely connected with quar- ry work, and that they were not the marks of masons or archi- tects or of the function of buildings into which they were incor- porated. The structures which have been surveyed on the W end of the mill beach have obviously nothing to do with the exploita- tion of the quarries, and, besides, are clearly subsequent to antiquity. They could be connected with a vault of dry stones which emerges from the sand a few meters SW, and which could possibly constitute a bridge on an anc. bed of the tributary of the swamp. They include a square washer provided with a slotted lateral flap, on the SE flank of the mound of the wind- mill, of a type still used in the old village of Malia: two half- immersed straight 'channels', built in the ammouda, perpendi- cular to each other, whose lateral partitions are provided with notches placed facing each other (Fig. 157); a big pit, placed in the angles of the two channels, whose shape, like that of a tub, could have housed the lower half of a large paddle wheel. In the channel oriented E-W, two of the notches still contain the remains of wood pickets of oblong section. The 'channels' could correspond to a system of water circulation in relation to a water mill whose type goes back to the Rom period.' Quartier Mu. J.-C. Poursat, in collaboration with T. Cover, C. Knappett, and H. Prokopiou, reports on the 2004 study sea- son devoted to publication: 'A systematic re-examination of the terracotta tools (about 1,000 objects) relating to every-day activities (lamps, braziers, supports for heating and cooking, loom weights) was undertaken. The catalogue of these finds was also planned.' 157 Malia, Ammouda: half submerged stone quarry</page><page sequence="109">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 109 Palace. J.-C. Poursat reports on the 2004 study season devot- ed to publication: 'The study of the architecture as well as of the building processes within the Palatial building has been carried out by E. Andersen. M. Seferiades continued the study of 2,000 pieces of obsidian from the recent excavations of the palace.' Quartier Delta. I. Bradfer-Burdet reports on the 2004 cleaning season: 'This campaign aimed to clean the two build- ings of the Delta quarter, Ap and Ay, and the surrounding streets in order to clarify some points left unclear by the publication of the earlier excavations of 1931-1932. The resumption of the works in this part of the site, near both the palace and the Mu sector, was desirable from a scientific perspective but was also motivated by the need to arrange a circuit which could be visit- ed by the public. Buildings and streets were, until now, covered with earth and plants, a fact which made it impossible to under- stand them. Works were only concerned with the N half of the buildings, the rest having being buried under embankments, fol- lowing excavation, which had subsequently been converted into the garden of the excavation house. Nevertheless, the cleaning operations did provide us with a general view of the district and have allowed us to verify, and sometimes to modify, the previ- ously available data. The streets are very well preserved but parts of the walls (in particular the mud-brick ones in AP) have either collapsed since the excavations or are in immediate dan- ger of doing so: some restoration work should be considered. But, in a general sense, the stone walls and the floors are quite well preserved. Because the former plans were not very pre- cise, new plans of the buildings and streets have been drawn. The cleaning operations first showed that the traffic inside the houses as well as that between the houses and the road network may have not always been that proposed in the publication. Several occupation phases have also been revealed in the two buildings and in the streets, although it has not been possible to connect them with a precise period. Finally, the cleaning of the 'small square' to the SE revealed the presence of buildings not noticed at the time of the original excavations, which has led us to question the general organization of the district. The cam- paign allowed us to note that Ay and, even more so, AP, which cover a non-negligible surface and which are carefully built, represented important buildings in the city of Malia. The clear- ing of these buildings and of the adjoining streets brings new information on the NeoPalatial urbanization of Malia, providing us especially with a better understanding of the water drainage system. It remains to clean the E part of the area, which includes house Ky and the E section of the 'street of the sea', which leads toward the W esplanade of the palace, in order to have a global view of the central part of the NeoPalatial city. These works should be carried on in parallel with the study of the pottery of Ky, and should end with the publication of this building and its material. Lastly, the most interesting perspec- tive is that of the excavation of a new building in the Delta dis- trict, to the N of the 'street of the sea': some further excavations, while also completing the data on the settlement as well as on the urbanism of Malia, would allow us to clarify the stratigraphy of this area, for which we have, at present, too little data.' DEMOS OROPEDIOU LASITHIOU Psychro. V. Apostolakou (24th EPCA) reports (ADelt 53 [1998], 881) on conservation work conducted at the archaeological site. Hagios Charalambos cave. P. Betancourt (ASCSA) reports on the 2004 study season: 'This was the fourth year of work with the material from the Lasithi in E Crete. Excavations began in 2002 and were com- pleted in 2003 as a collaboration between P. Betancourt, C. Davaras and (in 2003) E. Stravopodi. The project is investigat- ing a cave used as an ossuary for bones and burial goods rang- ing in date from Neo to MM IIB. Most of the objects were deposited within a short period during MM IIB. Good progress was made on the pottery study this season. Sherds were joined together to form vases, which were sent to the Archaeological Museum in Hagios Nikolaos. Important conclusions this year involve the recognition of several of the regional styles repre- sented in the ceramics and characterization of the representa- tives of those styles that are present at Hagios Charalambos. Much of the pottery belongs to the local Lasithi-Pediada stylis- tic class. Imported pottery is in the minority, but it provides insights into the relations within Crete in the EM and MM peri- ods. Imported classes include Vasiliki ware from the Mirabello bay region, sherds from Knossos and the Messara, and vases from Malia, Kastelli, and Galatas. P. McGeorge continued work with the human bones from the site. The database of stud- ied bone continues to grow. Among the more interesting dis- coveries are examples of several pathologies. The most impor- tant work is the characterization of individuals, so that a picture of the population as a whole continues to improve as more data is added. The plan is to make this collection and its accompa- nying database an archive for future research after our project is complete, and discussion is under way on how best to imple- ment this goal. H.M.C. Diercks studied the stone tools. The site has a small but interesting corpus of stone tools. The stone tool assemblage consists of a few ground stone tools and many pieces of obsidian. Of particular note is the large corpus of BA microliths, a little known class of M obsidian tool. The site has the largest corpus of this class known from Crete. D.C. Reese studied the shells and animal bones found at the site. Among the interesting discoveries were several species of wild animals (including badger and hare) and three nerita shells (an Indo- Pacific shell whose closest source is the Red Sea). The nerita shells were all used as ornaments. The marine shells from the cave are particularly interesting because the site is so far from the sea. The research corrected a misidentification made previ- ously, noting that the previously identified 'ostrich eggshell' is indeed eggshell, but not ostrich. CENTRAL CRETE (Prefecture of Herakleion) (23rd EPCA; 13th EBA) DEMOS KASTELLIOU Smari, Acropolis. D. Chatzi-Valiannou (Archaeological Institute of Crete) gives a detailed report (ADelt 53 [1998], 913-19) on the conservation work and small-scale excavation conducted at this important BA-EIA site. MM and LM III pottery was collected from various sectors. In corridor E (S side of the acropolis) MM IB-II levels were revealed, associated with conical cups, and other small to medium size vessels, some of which were burned, whereas others had typical light-on-dark decoration.

Sherd scatters date to the M NeoPalatial and Med periods.</page><page sequence="110">110 JAMES WHITLEY DEMOS THRAPSANOU Galatas. G. Rethemiotakis (23rd EPKA) reports on the 2004 excavation season: 'Excavation was conducted along the E side of the monu- mental exterior N wall of the N wing of the palace bringing to light both the inner spaces of the wing and the massive con- structions and configurations of the hillside northwards. Its E section was much destroyed, by erosion and stone robbing, even below the floor level, and only the foundations going down to bedrock were preserved. These are massive and widen gradually downwards (i.e,. exterior wall 2.20m w.), recalling the footing system of mod. buildings. The foundations were designed to sustain the loads of a very heavy upper structure. The E section of the N wing, projecting considerably to the N and E, is its most significant section as it includes the M hall and its appendages. It would have had the appearance of a tower dominating the landscape from afar, particularly the W part of central Pediada by being visible from the M settlement at Kastelli. Its dominance would be further enhanced by the exploitation of the marked inclination of the hill which provid- ed possibilities for increasing and projecting the height and the monumentality of the building. The elevation of this section of the N facade was achieved by filling in the space between the foundation walls, which in effect raised the floor level up to 2m above the step of the lowest course of the E fagade. A strati- graphic trench under the floors and into the fill dates the con- struction to MM IIIA. The fill is actually composed of building material of the first phase of the palace (the foundation walls include many re-used ashlar blocks deriving from dismantled walls of the same phase), fragments of wall plasters with bright colours (red, light and dark blue) and much pottery of charac- teristic Knossian fabric. Fragments of an ostrich egg and a clay figurine of a male adorant were also found. EM sherds were collected from artificial cavities in the bedrock. This part of the N wing includes the M hall (7m by 4.60m) and its surroundings, for which the E faqade of the wing serves as its back wall. Positioning the M hall at this side of the building was not ran- dom. The magnificent view from this elevated position towards Pediada plain and the Lasithi range would please those living in or visiting the domestic quarter and the official apartments of the palace. The lay-out of a lustral basin is traceable at the N side of the M hall. Its interior would be visible from the side of the hall, over a dividing wall, possibly the base of a balustrade. Direct access from the hall is provided through a corridor and a staircase, as happens in similar cases, while another staircase starting from the same corridor leads to the upper floors. An important parameter in evaluating the function of the N wing is the configuration of the exterior area towards the N. This area (including building 3) was shaped by means of successive mas- sive retaining walls supporting large terraces, apparently used for the gathering of large crowds. Four successive terraces were traced and excavated, each corresponding to a projecting section of the exterior wall of the N wing. A peripheral way running along the exterior walls of the palace provides access from various directions and channels circulation to the N side of the palace, especially on the large upper terrace in front of the tripartite fagade with the niche and the probable flagstaffs. The N section of the processional way, excavated this year, follows the contour of the fagade wall leading to the upper terrace link- ing simultaneously the other three. It is shaped by successive retaining walls running uphill supporting packed earth and stone-made steps at intervals. The whole system of terraces, access ways, platforms and fixed constructions is extremely complex and sophisticated suggesting intensive, large-scale religious activity on the spot. Building 2. Tests were made in partly excavated areas. It has now become clear that building 2 has two phases, the first dating to LM IB and the second to LM IIIA2-B. Household activities attributed to the first phase include storage in pithoi and jars, grinding grain, food processing and weaving. Ritual activity combined with a display of objects is suggested by some cup-rhytons and richly decorated vases. Room 2 revealed pottery with characteristic LM IB decoration, along with a seal of serpentine with the representation of a running ibex. In LM IIIA2 the central section of the building was re-built taking the form of a large oblong space, possibly a magazine attached to the W wall of the LM IIIA2-B building 4.'

Madalaki (23rd EPCA) reports (ADelt 53 [1998], 849-51) on the rescue excavation at the Britzolaki- Galanaki plot which revealed an important 200-250m2 M build- ing of the NeoPalatial period located at the peak of a low hill. Building material and sherd scatters in the immediate vicinity suggest that it was surrounded by a contemporary settlement. The entire building was excavated in order to protect the site which until recently was used as a quarry for building material and has also been subjected to illegal excavation. Despite these setbacks, the ground plan is clear and includes five rooms for storage, where a total of 685 vessels (predominantly conical cups) were discovered, a monumental propylum leading to the upper floor (Fig. 159) and a central court measuring 7m by 7.50m.

The building was abandoned before it was destroyed by fire. A large fragment of burned wood belonging to one of the building's interior doors was preserved. A detailed description of each room and the associated artefacts is provid- ed. Two architectural phases are present, the second phase associated with the addition of room 1 and adjacent rooms for storage. Pottery is dated to LM IB. According to the excava- tor, the large number of conical cups, the careful storage of ves- sels in categories, in association with the large open space at the centre of the building, implies that this farmstead was not the residence of one family but served the local community and was the centre of specific rituals associated with libations. Tsoutsouros (anc. Inatos). A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) reports (ADelt 53 [1998], 847-49) on excavation at various plots. At the Halabalaki plot eight rooms of a well-preserved ECh building were uncovered, associated with ceramic vessels suitable for storage and domestic use. Cist tombs, containing primary buri- als were discovered, plus evidence for secondary burial inside a stone built cist. At the Kephallaki-Pitarokoili plot a total of 23 Rom tombs were discovered at about lm below the present sur- face. Finds include bronze coins placed on the deceased's mouth, glass vessels, bone pins, an iron ring and a pair of bone dice. At the Apostolaki plot four badly preserved tombs were discovered. At the Christaki-Pantelaki plot, which is located E of the cave of Elytheia, traces of ECh building remains were revealed. In the NW comer of the trench that was opened a layer of black sand and ash, which contained small stones and a few sherds, was significant. A concentration of eight LCl vessels and two bronze coins was discovered (Fig. 162). DEMOS HERAKLEIOU DAIDALOS programme. D.

Kinigotafkos (i.e., the chasm of the hunter) is the name of the deepest and most impressive chasm of Psiloritis, an immense natural well with perpendicular walls (ca 20m di. and 70m d.); apparently the reason for its selection as a cult place. Over the chasm at the crest of the precipice, around a rocky outcrop and mostly in the rock cracks, many votive objects had been dense- ly mounted. The site resembles natural features of M open-air sanctuaries, especially Jouktas where the chasm functioned as a huge receptacle of offerings. At Kinigitafkos the deposit com- prises of animal clay figurines (small and medium size bovids) and pottery. The animal figurines belong to two types: mould- made naturalistic, with fine modelling of the details, and solid schematic recalling earlier types of the Geo-Ar period. No less than 60 figurines were mended, but there are fragments of hun- dreds. This material is valuable for suggesting the continuation of offering bull and cow figurines in an open-air mountainous shrine, a practice which has deep roots in the M past. The pot- tery which accompanies the figurines is mostly cups and kan- tharoi and, in smaller numbers, basins, bowls and amphorae, for liquids and food to be offered to the anonymous divinity or to be consumed in feasting ceremonies. The disposition of the offerings suggests that ritual activity was concentrated around the rock, but the focus of ritual was undoubtedly the chasm, where liquids and religious objects probably ended up. The bottom of the chasm, according to information provided by the Mountaineering Club, is filled in by fallen rocks and garbage, so nothing beyond debris is visible. A find of exceptional sig- nificance is a clay replica of an Idaean type circular bronze shield (3 1cm di.). It has finely executed relief decoration com- prising of three concentric zones around a central rosette with foliate band and running spiral in between, which clearly imi- tates decoration of the repous6 technique. Its out-turned rim with two suspension holes recalls similar features on bronze shields. This important find proves the survival of the practice of dedicating shields (or replicas of them) down to the Hel peri- od. It also indicates that the small rural shrine of Kinigotafkos must have had some relation to the Idaean cave, the main reli- gious centre of Psiloritis, an assumption further supported by the proximity of its location along the route which links N cen- tral Crete to the Ida plateau, through the Krousonas valley.' Gournos. G. Rethemiotakis (23rd EPCA) reports on the res- cue excavation: 'A M peak sanctuary, unfortunately heavily looted, was excavated at the site of 'Korfi tou Tarou' of the summit Gournos, located at the S side of the Krousonas gorge. Gournos is the highest precipitous peak dominating the entrance of the gorge and the route to Zominthos and the Idaean cave. At the Rizoplages site, located at the foot of the peak, remains of a M settlement are still visible. A substantial LM IA building, with LM IIIC re-occupation, was excavated by N. Dimopoulou (ADelt 40 [1985], 297). The sanctuary is located on the rocky and rugged peak at an altitude of 1,300m. Remains of cult activity are observed in and around two rocky outcrops lying 100m apart. Most finds, namely animal and a few human clay figurines, a dozen miniature amphorae and some fragments of double axes of thin sheet-bronze, turned up from the N outcrop, mostly from rock crevices that had escaped looting. Associated pottery dates to MM III, specifically MM IIIA, as may be deduced from sherds of cylindrical cups with grooved-ribbed surfaces, a type well documented in assemblages from Knossos, Poros and Galatas. Several clay fragments belong to a circular house model, which recalls in shape the so-called hut urns of the PostPalatial period. It has a cylindrical form (with a door) end- ing up in a conical roof with a circular opening (chimney?). Traces of decoration render architectural features. The religious function of the hut is supported by the attachment of a pair of clay horns of consecration at the edge of the roof above the door. The hut's circular form is not attested in actual M architecture. It is, however, depicted in a group of talismanic seals considered by Evans to represent a real circular construction. The model of Gournos confirms their existence, and demonstrates that this is a construction of religious use located on mountain tops, proba- bly made of perishable materials. Such huts could have provid- ed a temporary shelter for the goddess figure or pilgrims. MM III pottery and some figurines were recovered from the S out- crop. Along the same area, blackened soil (probably the remains of a bonfire) containing fragmentary Hel cups covered a natural feature in the shape of a roughly circular configuration. These later finds suggest a cult revival in the Hel period.' DEMOS AGIAS VARVARAS Prinias. G.

Sculptures excavated between 1983-1996 were studied and a new plan of some rooms of the entire area of the Byz houses was completed. Structures (with their stratigraphical relations) of the trenches (1996-19977) in the agora area were studied and analysed. Six new trenches were opened in the odeion, in response to a request by the 23rd EPCA, as part of a project of study and restoration of the building co-ordinated by the Ephoreia with EU financing. Finds from the 1996-1997 excavations at the odeion were studied, including those from the area of the altar dedicated to the supreme god. Ceramic finds from the agora, including Byz and Venetian wares from the trenches in the area E of the odeion, the stoa on the W side of the odeion and from trench 3 were studied.'</page><page sequence="113">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 113 Byz quarter of the Pythion. D. Manacorda and E. Zanini (University of Siena, SAIA) report on the 2004 excavation campaign: 'We concentrated on the area of the so called Byz quarter, between the temple of Apollo Pythios and the Praetorium. Areas partly excavated in 2002-2003 were further investigated, in order to gain a better understanding of the topography from the 5th-8th Ct AD. Work included the enlarge- ment of the investigation area on the W street; a better analysis of the plan of the great building situated in the central part of the excavation; and the enlargement (in depth) of the trial trench in the E area of the excavation, whose purpose was to establish information about the city of Gortys in this area in the Gr and Rom periods. In the W part of the excavation area a pebbled road (of almost 20m in 1.) was discovered. This was first laid in the LRom period and experienced a second phase, one of con- solidation, in the Justinianic period. This road began in the area of the Praetorium and continued SW, in the direction of the Pythion theatre and the Mavropapas and Mitropolis quarters. A great, rectangular building of the Justinianic period (partially investigated in previous campaigns) followed the re-settling of the city plan which is marked by this important urban road. The great building was a two-storey structure, the ground floor was divided into (at least) five covered rooms which were flanked on the N, W and E sides by courtyards and open spaces. Excavation focused on the great room, paved in tiled (laterizio) slabs, which was connected on the N side to the previously known series of rooms. It was marked by a peculiar structure (a long, narrow longitudinal tub/basin, whose function remains as yet unclear). In a later phase, probably around the mid 7th Ct AD, this room was substantially transformed: the second floor was lost and it was provided with a new roof (we found it, col- lapsed, in its original position). In a following phase, the room was further transformed into a very modest residence, charac- terized by the presence of a stall (we found the carcasses of at least three animals crushed by the collapse of the roof) and of a habitation zone with simple, functional, pieces of furniture: a pithos for water and, probably, a pallet at a higher elevation, which was made of wood and plaster. In the E part of the exca- vation area we found consistent remains of wall alignments of (probably) the Rom period, which seem to indicate the presence in this area of a building of quite considerable dimensions, which is characterized by a regular distribution of the spaces. Other remains of walls, floors and channels (which came to light all over the area after we emptied a number of trenches of the mod. period) allow us an initial idea of the development of the city in this area and to gather a first image of the transfor- mation of the urban space between earlier periods and the L Antique and Byz periods.' Pythion theatre. F. Ghedini and J. Bonetto (University of Padova, SAIA) report on the 2004 campaign in the area of the Theatre of the temple of Apollo: 'This year's programme included three distinct phases of action: the survey of the build- ing, of its collapses and of the adjacent areas; the stratigraphi- cal excavation of the archaeological layers; and the analysis of the structures of the theatre, with special emphasis on architec- ture. The architectural and topographical survey was conduct- ed according to different instrumental methodologies so as to produce an exhaustive, graphical, 2D and 3D documentation of the monumental collapses discovered in 2003, which were meant to be removed in 2004. To fulfil this end, we scanned, with a laser scanner at the highest resolution, all of the struc- tures in the photographs taken from low height by a kite. Furthermore, we carried out a mobile spar GPS Trimble survey of the entire urban area in which the theatre is located, and we created a digital model. This year's season initially employed machines with which we removed the impressive parts of walls which had collapsed in all of the sections of the scenic building. Once the rubble had been removed it was possible to recognize, near the E entrance of the theatre, a functional transformation of the building, via the creation of a stall, in which we found two carcasses of horses which had been crushed by the collapse of the building in the second half of the 4th Ct AD. In a deeper layer we also found the stripping of the floors of the theatre and its foundation trench, which produced enough data to advance a first hypothesis of the date of the complex to, at the latest, the second half of the 2nd Ct AD. The excavation also reached the levels of the stage, which was paved in great slabs of grey lime- stone, but which had been partially looted. In the cavea area, the removal of the collapsed hoards, and related disordered material, allowed us to discover a consistent part of the archi- tectural structure of this area. We brought to light seven rows of seats (Fig. 163) of the first flight of steps (which are in pink sandstone), two stairways which gave access to the rows of seats (Fig. 164), the curvilinear corridor, with its (partially col- lapsed) vaulted soffit (in bricks and blocks of sandstone) and a vaulted passage which connected the corridor itself with the orchestra. An area of the seats had been pillaged in the 8th Ct AD before the transformation of the area into a dump for build- ing materials, whereas another section of the seats is still pre- served, with their decoration patterns as well as being in their mouldings. The extraordinary quantity of the hoard made it impossible to reach the anc. standing level (piano di calpestio) of the orchestra. Thanks to these works it has been possible to advance a more exhaustive interpretation of the architecture and the function of the theatre. In the area of the skene building we can now recognize, with a degree of precision, the N closing wall of the entire complex (a wall which is internally buttressed by brick pillars), the rooms which were gathered behind the front of the scaena and the corridor of the E entrance to the the- atre. Through this corridor, it was possible to have access to the curvilinear corridor of the sub-structure, and therefore to reach the different parts of the low section of the cavea. The access corridor was separated from the stage by a double door. The stage was 2.5m deep, and set against the retaining wall of the low section of the cavea. The low section of the cavea was composed originally of ten or eleven steps, the internal di. of the orchestra should have been between 10m and 1 lm.' Area S of the so-called Praetorium. G. Bejor (University of Milan, SAIA) reports on the 2004 excavation season which focused on the area S of the so-called Praetorium, between the palaistra of the gymnasium and the Byz aqueduct: 'In 2003 excavation had revealed a great building, probably constructed in the 4th Ct AD, which had collapsed and which was later partially re-used during the 7th and perhaps the 8th Cts AD. It 163 Gortys, Pythion theatre: general view</page><page sequence="114">114 JAMES WHITLEY 164 Gortys, Pythion theatre: detail of steps rested against a pre-existing great polygonal basin with an apsi- dal room, which, following the excavations of 2004, turned out to be a bathroom. Three steps allowed access from a great vaulted room which also included, towards the S, a huge nata- tio (swimming pool) with an entrance indicated by two columns; a frigidarium of a previously unknown bath complex, of which we have been able also to recognize traces of the perimeter. The floor was of limestone slabs interposed by tiles of slate. A number of fragments of opus sectile, possibly from the walls, had been thrown (together with stems of columns and other rubble) inside the filling of the basins. The creation of the polygonal cistern, resulting from the transformation of a previ- ous nymphaeum, seems to be related to the construction of the frigidarium A series of trial trenches confirmed the continuity of the baths eastwards: the trenches incorporated the already known praefurnium, which exploited the slope of the stadium, abandoned at the end of the 3rd Ct AD. An impermeable floor- ing, sited in the SE corner of the complex, at a higher level (almost 2m), seems to be always connected with the baths: it may be an over-elevated basin, the probable castellum aquae. The entire building was perfectly aligned with the gymnasium of the so called Praetorium, from which it would have been divided by a street, while, in the S area, it would have faced towards an open area, which remains to be investigated.' Mitropolis basilica. R. Farioli (University of Bologna, SAIA) reports on the 2004 excavation season which took place in collaboration with the 13th EBA: 'Work concerned with the completion of the 2002 excavations of the two minor N aisles of the Mitropolis basilica. It has been possible to reveal the monumental collapse that occurred in this area characterized by many fragments of marble columns and capitals. The collapse covered the floor, made from great rectangular limestone slabs, where we found interesting finds of fragments of architectural elements as well as of decorated plutei (marble and limestone). The cleaning of the two small S aisles was also begun. The narthex area (1 lm N-S) has been cleared up to the door (which is endowed with a marble threshold) of the first minor S aisle. The flooring was set in great slabs which, in some areas, had been plundered. The fagade wall of the narthex, on which we found a door (US 637) with a marble threshold, is in better con- dition. The door which had been found further to the S, in 2002, lay in front of the central aisle. The layers investigated during the excavation of the narthex produced results similar to those gathered during the last campaign; apart from marble fragments of architectural materials (some inscribed), a block carrying an inscription which had been re-used in the front wall of the narthex and many fragments of opus sectile from the walls. A second area of excavation, which was established in order to verify in the future the possible typology of the narthex with extended arms (Gr narthex), focused on a new sector which is located S of the S wall of the narthex and is extended, in a W direction, up to the inclusion of the possible area of the S porch of the atrium, which remains under collapsed structures. We found the N part of the room leaning from the S side of the narthex bordered on the E and W sides with walls which are not united with their respective structures. The W perimeter wall, composed from re-used material, bears a great fragment of a marble moulding, with a frieze with a scene with a sacred sub- ject, which is decorated with Ionic kyma, astragali and pearls, and some large letters belonging to an inscription. During the course of excavation other marble fragments (a slab with a cross, small column, etc.) were found. The most interesting find, which indicates the importance of the annex as well as the basilica was discovered at the SW corner of the room, behind the W wall, over the slab floor: a very large number of frag- ments of a wall mosaic (which had fallen because of the col- lapse of the decorative hanging of the walls) with their mortar and with polychrome tesserae in marble and in glass paste and also in gold leaf (from 0.5cm to lcm) and including inscribed fragments. From the same area came a fragment of mosaic with plaster painted in red and, also, a great number of fragments of plaster painted in ochre-yellow with red letters. To the W of the narthex, the perimeter wall of the S arm of the porch of the atri- um was found, the jamb of a big opening (1. ca 3m) and the floor, with great slabs, which goes beyond the porch towards the S. This porch pre-dates the construction of the quadriportico.' DEMOS MOIRON Moni Odigitrias. A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA) and K. Branigan (Sheffield, BSA) report on the 2004 survey study season: 'The primary goal of the survey was to place the two PrePalatial tholos tombs excavated near the monastery in their contemporary context. The tholos cemetery was established E in EM I and continued in use to the beginning of MM IB. Careful study of fabrics as well as forms and wares allowed much of the M pottery to be more precisely identified in chrono- logical terms. As a result the probable location and extent of PrePalatial, Palatial and PostPalatial settlements was plotted with some confidence. The initial occupation of the area began in the Final Neo with settlement focused on and around a steep- sided, flat-topped hill about 700m N of where the tholos ceme- tery would later be established. The remains of a perimeter wall can be traced around the top of this hill, but although it may belong with the thin scatter of Final Neo pottery, it cannot be firmly dated. The people living here probably buried their dead in shallow rock shelters overlooking the course of the stream about 800m to the E. Whether occupation remained here or moved further S in EM I is not clear; no certain EM I sherds were recovered in the survey. By EM IIA, however, three new settlement locations appear to have been adopted, further S and nearer the tholos cemetery. The densest concentration of mate- rial was around a high rocky promontory W of the monastery, where houses must have been terraced into the hillside. The spread of pottery was sufficient to suggest that several buildings may have stood here. About 200m to the N the remains of per- haps three small single-roomed huts could be traced on top of a small round-topped hill. A third thin spread ofEM material was found around, but not on, a low flat-topped hill 300m to the N of the tholos cemetery. These various settlement sites were pre- sumably occupied by the families who built and used the two tholos tombs. Before the tombs went out of use two of the</page><page sequence="115">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2004-2005 115 settlement sites - those to the N and the W - appear to have expanded and these two sites continued in use into the NeoPalatial period after the tholos cemetery had been aban- doned. Both sites may have occupied about a hectare and were presumably hamlets or small villages. The third EM site (on the small rounded hill) was replaced by a single substantial build- ing, about 10m2, on the hill-top immediately to the N. This building used the topography of the hill in such a way that on the E side it probably had a basement. This house was in use from MM IA to MM IIIA. With the tholos cemetery no longer in use, burials in the Palatial era may have been made in two possi- ble house-tombs built on the bare top of a small but vertically- sided outcrop about 500m to the E. In contrast to the area S of the monastery, where the 1970 survey revealed that occupation ceased in MM I and picked up again in the Cl era, the area N of the monastery saw occupation through to LM III, but then seems to have been abandoned until the ERom period. An extensive set- tlement then spread alongside the river course for about 300m, to the NNE of the monastery. When the monastery was established, an extensive hillside settlement grew up on the site previously occupied by EM-MM settlement to the W of the monastery.' DEMOS TYMBAKIOU Phaistos. V. La Rosa (University of Catania, SAIA) reports on the 2004 excavation season: 'A trial trench was opened along the W faqade of the second palace (at the N border of room XIX) and a second trial trench along the E side of room LXIV. The existence of five courses of foundation in room XIX, behind the euthynteria of the sec- ond palace was confirmed. The first three courses were con- nected with the most recent building, while the other two were connected with two different phases of life of the first palace. The lowest courses (which can be assigned to an initial date of MM IB) should represent the original front of the building, anterior to the front 'with orthostaths' which should be regard- ed as being associated with the great paved courtyard as well as with the theatre staircase. The fourth course should, converse- ly, be associated with the attempted reconstruction following the radical seismic destruction at the end of MM II, this course documents an attempt to narrow the building . The narrowing project was rapidly abandoned, in favour of a restoration of the fagade line of the ortostaths. At this point the casting of very hard 'concrete', which was made of stones, clay, mortar and ceramic fragments (a mixture locally named astraki), should have been employed, in order to provide an extension of the previous building. This second project however also remained unfinished and it is only at the beginning of LM IB that the palace would have been entirely re-built. The 5th foundation course was associated with MM IA levels and had destroyed an EM I house. The sequence (we have been unable to reach the virgin soil because of the narrowness of the area) was conclud- ed by a number of Neo levels (of at least six episodes), which yielded entire, or easily restorable, vases. The great amount of material provides further proof of the quality of Phaestian pro- duction at the end of the Neo period, with the first attempts at varnished decoration, distinguishable from the well-known cat- egory of vases painted in ochre. The second trial trench, along the E side of room LXIV of the first palace, corresponding to the mighty LM foundations and the only part of the so called antemurale which was spared by Levi, showed the overlap of these foundations with the walls of the first palace. This was revealed by the thick layer of 'con- crete' which had been thrown over this section of the building after the destruction of 1700 BC. The overlap of the casting on the E wall of LXIV (which previous campaigns had associated with the attempts to reconstruct this section of the building dur- ing a short period between two close earthquakes) allows us to hypothesize two distinct castings of concrete after the two earthquakes. With the first filling of concrete the two lower storeys of the building would have been obliterated, leaving only the third floor level. The second filling, which covered this floor level, was done with a view to the reconstruction (an event which never happened) of a higher level. The relations between the structures and the stratigraphic correspondences in the restricted area between the foundations of the second palace and the small part of antemurale (spared by Levi) have allowed us to affirm that these two structures are contemporary. It is, therefore, possible to suppose to that the entire SW quarter of the second palace (room 95 W and the three rooms 98) corre- sponds to a single building phase. Both of the trenches, dug in sectors quite far away from the W area of the building, should have produced portions of a unique filling of concrete, poured after the second earthquake. The prevalence, among the finds inside the filling, of bridge-spouted jars, in room XIX, and of large lamps, in room LXIV, raises questions which concern the original position of those objects, the homogeneity of storage and the function of the different quarters of the first palace (with which these objects were, most likely, associated). In a third trial trench, which was dug in response to a request by the 23rd EPCA, in view of the pillars of the new protective roof and in the area W of room R/3, we unexpectedly found a ProtoGeo ramp, which represents the first 'public' space of the site in the ProtoGeo period. It has been possible to connect this ramp with a series of paved segments which had been attributed already to the Myc period. The ramp followed, with all proba- bility, the course of three M ramps (respectively dated to MM IB, MM II and MM IIA).' Agia Triada. The following volume has been published: P. Militello, O.

DEMOS CHANION Chania, M necropolis. Eleftherotypia (19/7/2004) and Ta Nea (20/7/2004) report on the spectacular discovery and excavation by M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki (25th EPCA) of over 50 tombs in a LM III cemetery of M Kydonia. The architectural forms (chamber tombs, pit caves and cist graves) and associated bur- ial customs are comparable to the contemporary cemetery of Zapher Papoura excavated by A. Evans at Knossos. Numerous were the bronze weapons, including swords (one 80cm long), spears and arrow heads, ceramic vessels, seals and jewellery. Museum work and site conservation. M.

Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA) reports (ADelt 53 [1998], 856-58) on the rescue excavation. The earliest occupation phases date to the MM period, damaged by a LM IIIB pit. Throughout the excavated site building remains of the NeoPalatial period were discovered (MM III and LM I) including a polythiron which had been blocked in LM IB. At the E end of the excavated area a pit contained burned earth, carbon and pottery dating to MM IIIB-LM IA. Some building remains dating to LM IIIA were discovered associated with a pithos and small bothros. The large LM IIIB pit B was associ- ated with large quantities of pottery, animal bones, stone grinders and pounders, obsidian blades and flakes, and generally S7() ('h~llinil: cIUVl I dI11f) resembles contemporary rubbish pits with comparable material located outside but very near M buildings at the Kastelli hill as well as in the area of Splanzia. Next to this pit two deep wells were discovered, the first containing great quantities of pottery which included kylikes and champagne cups and animal bones. The second well revealed various concentrations of human bones associated with pottery including fragments of pithoi. Pit B was sealed off by LM IIIB2 occupation levels associated with a hearth, badly preserved due to a LM IIIC pit. Odos Tsanakaki. M.
