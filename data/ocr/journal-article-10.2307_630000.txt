This book offers interpretations of seven plays of</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS 197 Euripides: Alcestis, I. T., Helena, Ion, Andromache, Heracles and Orestes, with appendices on the re- construction of the Cresphontes and on the Iphigeneia myth. Formally the common factors are that in each play there is some variant of the rescue story, and in each there are at least two 'reversals', one positive (bad to good) and one negative. ('Reversal' here seems to correspond to Aristotle's metabasis rather than peripeteia). The approach is thus through plot structure rather than character, and, like Lattimore's Story Patterns in Greek Tragedy and Strohm's Euripides, it is an example of the current tendency to approve the Aristotelian stress on the significance of plot. B., however, sees more in these tragedies than the manipulation of exciting plots and the composition of variations on familiar story patterns. 'Each play', she observes in her intro- ductory chapter, 'shows human exertion to be blind and ineffective at best, sordid sometimes, and occasionally contemptible and cruel. And each play meanwhile depicts a divine pity and purpose that can when it is ready turn disaster into bliss.' The following chapters contain so much that is important and controversial that it would be impossible to discuss them all, and I shall therefore concentrate mainly on the Heracles, since this is perhaps the most serious and important of these plays, and we have here the greatest divergence from most current interpretations. The first part of the play is seen as an example of suppliant drama ending in rescue, one of the common story patterns; but Megara breaks the 'suppliant rule' by leaving sanctuary as soon as she is threatened with fire, and thus sins against Zeus by virtually denying his function and power as protector of suppliants at his altar. Heracles returns and rescues his family, but if Zeus is concerned with justice, 'how can such a god allow mortals who have flouted his suppliant nomos to profit by their impiety and faithless- ness?' So the homicidal madness inflicted on Heracles in the middle section is an instrument of divine punishment on himself and his family. On himself, because he too is guilty of hubris in his bloody vengeance on Lycus and his threats of wholesale slaughter in Thebes. Moreover by his unbroken series of triumphs, ending in his transgression of the boundary line between mortal and immortal by his descent into Hades and return, he has risen too high and must be brought low. In the last part the gods permit him to be rescued from despair by Theseus, but he is a different Heracles, humbled by the power of the gods and stripped of his superhuman immunity from disaster and disgrace. At the end Heracles himself knows nothing of future divine honours, but the spectator, on the strength of a few 'muffled hints' and his recollection of Hesiod's Eoiai, is expected to take into account the fact that the gods in their wisdom have this consolation in store for the hero. From this bald summary it will be seen that we are presented with a coherent, well-constructed play in which we contemplate the faithlessness and violence of mortals contrasted with the justice and pity of the gods. I am not, however, convinced that this is the play Euripides wrote. It is certainly instructive to study the typology of plot, and elsewhere in her book B. brings out the significance of variations on story patterns, but some limitations must be recognised. Have we, for instance, enough material to be sure that suppliants never leave sanctuary unless driven out by force or fraud, so that when Megara does so in response to a threat the audience would at once realise that they were witnessing an act of impiety against Zeus, hardly less sacrilegious than a violation of sanctuary? Euripides provides them with no other clue: Amphitruo never makes this point, and the main difference between him and Megara is merely that he is more hopeful about the return of Heracles; the chorus say nothing relevant, either in the iambic passage (252-74) or in the following choral ode. B. compares Megara with Iocasta tempting Oedipus, but (a) Iocasta specifically urges disregard of oracular warnings and (b) her words are imme- diately followed by a choral ode on the dangers of impiety. In Heracles the stasimon on impiety is much later (735 ff.) and the reference is clearly limited to Lycus (760 'the impious man is dead'). More crucial is the guilt or innocence of Heracles. That we are expected to see him as a victim of 'divine envy' has some plausibility, and has been suggested by e.g. Grube and Rivier. His triumphs have been emphasised in the earlier scenes, and Megara's declaration that to his family Heracles is the equal of Zeus Soter (not mentioned by B.) might be thought ominous. This is in line with the words of Iris in 841-2, and the general notion would of course be familiar to the audience. It might also be possible to regard the divine envy in general as operating here through the more personal ill-will of Hera, a well established feature of the Heracles story. B., however, firmly rejects the jealousy of Hera, brings Zeus more prominently into the picture and seeks to moralise the whole situation by treating as guilty of hubris both Megara and Heracles. Yet the killing of Lycus, a usurper who was about to put to death the whole family of Heracles, would surely seem to a Greek audience a simple act of retributive justice. The threat of a general slaughter of Thebans is only a threat, uttered in hot rage; later in the same scene Heracles shows himself calm and reasonable, and in his last speech before the madness scene his playful tenderness towards his family lends no support to the idea of a man on the verge of a breakdown or a man of blood inviting divine punishment. In the next scenes nobody could accuse Heracles of deliber- ate infanticide, but B. assumes that his madness takes the form of imagining that he is killing Eurystheus and his sons because the idea of doing so was attractive to the sane Heracles, so that 'the illusory deed is the hero's own', and he is no more free from guilt than the Sophoclean Ajax. But whereas Ajax while sane had planned to murder the Atreidae, there is nothing</page><page sequence="3">198 NOTICES OF BOOKS in this play to suggest that (apart from Lycus) Heracles had any murderous intentions before he was driven mad: the only references to Eurystheus (580, 614 ff.) are not hostile. One further comment: unlike most scholars B. finds no discrepancy between the rest of the play and the famous lines on the nature of divinity spoken by Heracles (1340-46). It is true that the first four lines contain nothing essentially different from passages in Pindar and elsewhere criticising certain false and unworthy tales about the gods, and are not necessarily incompatible with the mythical pre- suppositions of this play. The main point, however, lies in erat . . . o6evd0;, which even if not pressed to the point of excluding anthropomorphism seems at any rate to exclude the desire of Zeus for Alcmene. I have used up my space in giving some reasons for disagreement on the Heracles, and to redress the balance it must suffice to say that in other chapters I find much that is convincing, and illuminating comments on points of detail. For instance, B. is surely right to assume that at any rate by the time of Euripides an Athenian audience would be sufficiently familiar with certain recurring types of episode, such as recognition, escape, rescue, revenge and the like, to have a general idea of how such scenes were likely to develop, and she gives a perceptive and persuasive account of how in Helena and Orestes expectations are deliberately disappointed and tradi- tional sequences so boldly varied and interrupted that sometimes the effect is almost one of caricature. In general I would recommend these well-docu- mented, lively, original and at times provocative essays to the attention of those interested in Euripides and Attic tragedy. P. T.
