ROBERT SHIRRELL, Journals Manager</page><page sequence="15">INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS OF REVIEW ARTICLES HE REVIEW ARTICLES published by The Quarterly Review of Biology are intended espe- I g! 0 cially for the informed general biologist, and should present not only a synthesis of recent investigations but also a critical evaluation of them. Theoretical papers should include a critical synthesis of the literature bearing on the theory and promote further research. Both invited and unsolicited articles are considered by The Quarterly, and the Editors encourage the submission of unsolicited articles that conform to the objectives of the journal. An article should be written in concise and sufficiently nontechnical language to be intelligible both to specialists in other fields and to general biologists. Interpretive diagrams are desirable. An article must have a brief abstract that summarizes the principal conclusions of the paper. In most matters of style, articles should conform to the recommendations of The Chicago Manual of Style, Thirteenth Edition, published by The University of Chicago Press (5801 S. Ellis Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637 USA); in respect to the form of references cited, however, authors should see a recent issue of the journal, or request from the office of The Quarterly a detailed set of instructions for the preparation of the list of references. Footnotes to textual material are not permitted, but explanatory material of secondary importance may be set off in the text in small print. Issues from December 1990 on will serve as a model for style with respect to (1) section headings in the text, (2) literature citations in the text (note that the name/date citation form is used), and (3) the list of references. The abbreviations of journal titles used in the references section should conform to the BIOSISList of Serials (BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts, 2100 Arch St., Philadelphia, PA 19103 USA). All entries should give the full title and inclusive page numbers of the articles cited. Manuscripts that do not conform to the format of The Quarterly will be returned to their authors for appropriate reworking. Send three sets of glossy prints of illustrations, appropriate for reduction to a width of 55/16 or 29/36 inches; do not send original artwork unless requested to do so. Authors who attribute support to a funding agency with a policy of publication support will be expected to meet charges of $30 per journal page for each of the first 20 journal pages, and $60 for each journal page in excess of 20. Authors not supported by funding agencies and authors of invited articles are eligible for 20 free journal pages (approximately 50 double-spaced typewritten manuscript pages or their equivalent in bibliographic or illustrative matter). When such articles are longer than 20 journal pages, authors will be charged $60 for each page above the allotment of 20 free journal pages. These charges will be used for direct support of the issue in which the article appears. An original and two copies of all articles submitted for consideration should be sent to The Editors, The Quarterly Review of Biology, Division of Biological Sciences, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5275 USA. Submission of manuscripts on computer disks or via BITNET (see inside front cover for BITNET address) is encouraged. The file must be IBM compatible or transformable into an ASCII file. Inquire for details. NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS AND SOFTWARE New biological books and software for consideration in this section should be sent to The Editors, The Quarterly Review of Biology, Division of Biological Sciences, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5275 USA. COPYING BEYOND FAIR USE The code on the first page of an article in this journal indicates the copyright owner's consent that copies of the article may be made beyond those permitted by Sections 107 and 108 of the U.S. Copyright Law provided that copies are made only for personal or internal use, or for the personal or internal use of specific clients and provided that the copier pay the stated per copy fee through the Copyright Clearance Center, Inc., Operations Center, 27 Congress Street, Salem, MA 01970. To request permission for other kinds of copying, such as copying for general distribution, for advertising or promotional purposes, for creating new collective works, or for resale, kindly write to Permissions Department, The University of Chicago Press, 5801 S. Ellis Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637. If no code appears on the first page of an article, permission to reprint may be obtained only from the author.</page><page sequence="16">CONTENTS Potential Reproductive Rates and the Operation of Sexual Selection T.
