<plain_text><page sequence="1">Perspectives Biology Teachers and Peace L. Jack Whitney Crescent Valley High School Corvallis, Oregon 97330 Eleven years ago (1970) ABTpub- lished an article of mine entitled "Is There a Doctor on the Planet?" I said then that "humanity, if the whole of it were viewed as an individual, would be diagnosed insane by the criteria psychologists use. Weapons that would necessarily be both su- icidal and homicidal are more than possessed; they are aimed and ready to fire." I contended that our species needed heroic therapy and asserted that "teachers of biology seem to have been selected, partly by default, to carry out much of the treatment." My article was deficient in its lack of a prescription for the patient. My notion of the remedy was tentative then; it is now a firm conviction. Biology teachers are uniquely situated to turn mankind away from the madness of nuclear armament and toward peaceful cooperation. Their textbooks, laboratories, and field studies buttress with solid fact Albert Schweitzer's concept of the universal will to live and its philo- sophically inescapable corollary: the ethical principle of Reverence for Life (Schweitzer 1958). Humans share with trees, fungi, finches, and goldfish the basic molecules of life, including nucleic acids, which differ only in detail between life forms. Unity is inescapable on this mole- cular level, but it is equally apparent in the ubiquitousness of life-preserv- ing physiological and anatomical devices, diverse though these may be among species. The exquisite im- mune response in humans, the re- productive exuberance of sea ur- chins, the camouflage of moths, the specialized structure of bird beaks, phototropism in plants; the list of tactics employed in what Darwin called the "universal struggle for life" is endless (Darwin 1859). Teachers of biology need take only a short step when they guide young- sters beyond observation of these unifying phenomena to the rever- ence they deserve: Here, students: this tendency on the part of organisms to remain alive and to perpetuate their kind is a trait held in common by everything that lives. It is the single most important character- istic shared by living things. You may verify it everywhere by scientific obser- vation and rational thought. It de- mands your respect as a first principle. Teachers and textbooks need to say that and document it; they need to keep it constantly in focus in order that their students may know deeply and fully the truth of the universal will to live; in order that they may come naturally to revere life, to insist upon maintaining and enhancing life, and to eschew every human activity involving avoidable sullying or de- struction of life. Youngsters must learn the unnaturalness of war and of weapons-building. But is humanity no healthier men- tally than it was a decade ago? Is "insanity" still an appropriate diag- nosis for mankind? Carl Sagan says in his book Cosmos, "Every thinking person fears nuclear war, and every technological state plans for it. Every- one knows it is madness..." (Sagan 1980). Madness. During the 1970s the United States alone developed such new instruments of terror as Multiple Independently Targetable Reentry Vehicles (MIRVs) and MX missiles, rockets designed to avoid destruction by running and hiding continuously like rabid gophers in thousands of miles of tunnel under western U.S. deserts. And we built the neutron bomb: a metaphoric statement in military hardware of modern man's emotional distress. Neutron bombs destroy no property -just life! Such biocidal preparations by nations directly contradict the elemental observation that life natur- ally strives to persevere. Such bio- cidal plotting is insane. "Combined, the nuclear arsenals of (the United States and the Soviet Union) have the destructive power of three tons of high explosive for every man, woman, and child alive today" (Weiss 1980). In Carl Sagan's im- agery, that total destructive power equates with "a World War II every second for fhe length of a lazy after- noon." Madness. Is this psychopathology of our spe- cies still truly the threat that it was ele- ven years ago when my previous arti- 502 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 43, NO. 9, DECEMBER 1981</page><page sequence="2">cle appeared? Science 80 (1980) re- ports that since November 1979 the U.S. has been mistakenly warned of a Soviet attack three times. The second and third alarms were traced to a computer with a defective inte- grated circuit chip worth 46 cents. The report adds that on those two occasions, "Nuclear-armed B-52 bombers (were) warmed up, ready to retaliate after the expected Soviet attack." The same article concludes with this chilling statement: "The Soviet warning system is believed to be less sophisticated than America's, giving its commanders less time to make a decision and therefore mak- ing them more likely to fire their missiles." These indicators of fear, bungling, and murderous intent in the world suggest that humanity is in even greater danger now than it was eleven years ago. But in assess- ing present peril, we should ponder too what Jiri Weiss (1980) sees in America as "lack of a constituency for arms control." And we should perhaps include a commonly ac- cepted estimate that roughly half of our scientific research is devoted to military projects (Commager 1980). The prospects for human survival, even for a few more decades, grow dimmer year by year. The suspicion and fear that moti- vate nations to equip themselves so redundantly for offense and de- fense are worth examining in them- selves. What is it about the United States that so frightens the Soviet Union? How does Russia threaten us? Both countries fear a plot by the other to overwhelm them and rule the world. We see in the Soviet sys- tem (and until quite recently, we saw in the Chinese system!) such evils as restriction of individual freedoms and replacement of religion by worship of the secular state. And we are not altogether wrong. Russia, on the other hand, pictures us as a society where capitalists dominate and pros- per at the expense of a working class, and at the expense of weaker na- tions. Can we deny the partial truth in that perception? Both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. blind themselves to their own weaknesses, grossly overesti- mate the other's flaws and, based on such hugely distorted perceptions, see the enemy as malignant; attri- bute hostile intent to one another. An individual who imagines such malevolence in another person or group suffers what psychologists term paranoia, a state of mental ill- ness: the Russian and American nations are paranoid-insane. By the same psychological criteria, no nation is entirely healthy. All nations largely ignore their biologically identical needs to sustain and enhance life, needs they share even with the mold on their bread. But in contrast with political states, most individual persons are sane; still in touch with the inherent will to live, albeit unconsciously. They are dependable in contractual relations, they distinguish right acts from wrong ones, and most of their behavior is rational. In the Soviet Union, ordi- nary citizens, military people, and government leaders are at least as fearful of a nuclear war as are their American counterparts. For many Russians, war within their own country is a painful memory. People everywhere sense an inescapable doomsday approaching when some political miscalculation, or an acci- dent, will release all the stored-up fury of hell in a convulsive moment. Will another Cuba or Afghanistan or Vietnam touch it all off? Another faulty electronic component in some- body's warning system? When? is the only question for most of us. Having failed yet to learn what adaptive coloration in peppered moths and snowshoe rabbits can teach us, we continue marching stolidly down the way to dusty death. Russia's military is, like ours, much too large and too thoroughly estab- lished to be dismantled or even to be reduced much in size. As President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned de- cades ago, America's armed forces are allied with private industry and government in a web of shared in- terests, including power, prestige, and money: what Eisenhower called the "military-industrial complex." But warnings by experts have never yet availed against these entrenched institutions. Harold Urey and Albert Einstein warned citizens of the world repeatedly-and how ironically!- that the nuclear engines made pos- sible by their seminal scientific work must be destroyed or mankind would perish. The cautionary words were wasted. New and deadlier weapons grow steadily in number. But the growth is malignant, and we can wait no longer. We must now look for directions to that first principle, the omnipresence in organisms of a de- votion to survival; a real force, dwarf- ing all the ghastly artifacts of war ever conceived, and making trivial every- thing that separates people politi- cally. Is it conceivable that the dreary trend that began thirty-six years ago in Hiroshima and Nagasaki can be reversed in biology classes? Imagine what might result if the basic biology curriculum were rebuilt so as to pro- vide general currency for the world view proposed fifty years ago by practicing biologist Albert Schweitzer, a missionary-physician, a philoso- pher, a musician and musicologist, and the winner of the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize. Schweitzer's world view, which he called Reverence for Life, was inspired by his objective obser- vation of a universal will to live. Charles Darwin had recognized earlier in organisms the same all- pervasive phenomenon. He too saw its implications as enormously im- portant. The third chapter of his Ori- gin of Species is entitled "Struggle for Existence." In it Darwin said: Nothing is easier than to admit in words the truth of the universal strug- gle for life, or more difficult .., than constantly to bear this conclusion in mind. Yet unless it be thoroughly en- grained in the mind,...the whole economy of nature, with every fact on distribution, rarity, abundance, extinc- tion, and variation, will be dimly seen or quite misunderstood. This single trait, then, this ubiquitous effort to survive, unites all people- all organisms. And as Dr. Schweitzer explained so compellingly, that single shared quality of life, amenable to PERSPECTIVES 503</page><page sequence="3">FIGURE 1. Dr. Albert Schweitzer, 1956.

(Courtesy of Clara Urquhart) direct perception and rational thought, insists upon our deepest respect; what he called Reverence for Life. Given Schweitzer's ethical principle, solidly grounded as it is in reason and scientific observation, a global unity of mankind is logically necessary. Those two giants of hu- man thought, Charles Darwin, the father of modern biology, and Albert Schweitzer, the "Leonardo" of his century, are our authorities. They insist from beyond the grave that we revise textbooks of biology in the light of their insights. When we do, humanity can at last turn from the march into darkness that began when two monstrous and pernicious clouds spread a smothering pall over Japan and made forever a cruel joke of the epithet, "Land of the Rising Sun." That necessary new world view would do violence to no scientific truths; rather, it would accord pre- eminence to a truth that all biologists might embrace as earnestly as Dar- win did more than a century ago. For the universal "struggle for existence," or will to live, is verifiable everywhere and at all times by thoughtful observ- ers. For example, such sedentary marine animals as sea urchins have an efficacious and fascinating means of reproducing. Animals of both sexes living in close proximity dis- gorge millions of eggs and sperm al- most simultaneously into the sur- rounding water. Enough fertilized eggs result to permit maintenance of a nearly constant population, despite enormous losses to predators and bad luck. This is an undisputed and venerable fact. Hermaphroditic living achieves the same end for the non - gregarious earthworm: when two worms meet, both have eggs and sperm to trade. But such provisions for supererogatory fertilization in large mammals would be disastrous to a limited habitat, and they do not occur. Mammals reproduce in less effusive but equally efficient, equally marvelous ways, and their progeny thrive. And so it is for all creatures- in the plant kingdom, among protists, everywhere-reproductive mode ac- commodates need, and the will to live, perpetuate the kind, is obvious. If there be anything of value for biologists in this recapitulation of some elementary facts concerning reproduction, it is the emphatic demonstration that a first principle, called by Albert Schweitzer the uni- versal will to live, truly does unite organisms. That principle ought to be boldly apparent, explicitly stated, in each chapter of biology textbooks, for it illuminates equally the study of gas exchange in snails and seaweed, the examination of hormonal inte- gration in orchids and mice, and the consideration of metabolism in spiders and planaria. Perhaps the notion of "will" or "struggle," applied to an alga or a flatworm seems anthropomorphic, and therefore disturbing. It should not: no mysterious consciousness or intelligence is connoted by the terms. Our language simply lacks better words for the concept. The thoughtful observer sees that individual organisms express the ubiquitous will to live quite as patent- ly as do species and populations. Mechanisms of healing, of tissue regeneration, are easily subsumed under Schweitzer's rubric. So too are danger-avoiding behaviors in all their amazing forms: just as a human jumps to safety when a falling tree threatens to squash him, a compara- tively simple mussel, anchored to a rock, clamps tightly together the 504 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 43, NO.'9, DECEMBER 1981</page><page sequence="4">valves of its shell when a droplet of starfish tissue extract enters the water nearby. Of course, individual wills are frustrated continually, and as often by humans as by any other agency. Dr. Schweitzer explained the close connection to Reverence for Life of this necessary frustration by one creature of another's attempt to thrive. He said that for those who follow rational thought to his ineluc- table ethic, "Existence will thereby become harder... in every respect ... but at the same time it will be richer, more beautiful, and happier." His meaning here was that one must continually destroy other lives in the process of living one's own life. And because no external authority dic- tates relative values of separate lives, existence becomes harder indeed. Each person is fully responsible for the life-promoting and life-diminish- ing effects of his behavior. On the other hand, acceptance of respon- sibility for one's own acts enriches life in proportion as one consciously makes ever more choices in favor of life-in favor of saving, promoting, and improving life. Schweitzer illus- trated this in his autobiography by describing how when he rescued a young fish eagle he accepted daily the responsibility for killing small fish to feed it. Such individual ethical judgments, practiced consistently, would preclude any person's partici- pation even in the planning of such diabolical military devices as neutron bombs. A new biology capable of revolu- tionizing human thought in every aspect of life and commerce be- comes increasingly possible as more biologists read thoughtfully Schweit- zer's succinct autobiography, Out of My Life and Thought. In the epilogue of his book, its most important sec- tion in this context, Schweitzer says: To the question whether I am a pessi- mist or an optimist, I answer that my knowledge is pessimistic, but my will- ing and hoping are optimistic . .I experience in its full weight what we conceive to be the absence of purpose in the course of world happenings. But a bit later he says: In my view no other destiny awaits mankind than that which, through its mental and spiritual disposition, it prepares for itself. Therefore I do not believe that it will have to tread the road to ruin right to the end. Here Dr. Schweitzer showed perhaps a bit more optimism than he realized he had. Many share his pessimism of experience but, in a paradoxical way, everyone has more cause for hope because of him. Those who are able by training and position to help in the noble work of rewriting biology texts to include as unifying principles the will to live and its derived ethic, Reverence for Life-those who can aid in promoting this sanguine cur- riculum change -are obliged to do so by their commitment to rational thought. And in their effort to help rational thought assume its dominant place in the curricula of biological science, science teachers are surely justified in expecting official endorse- ments by such prestigious profes- sional groups as the National Associ- ation of Biology Teachers, the Amer- ican Institute for Biological Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the National Science Teachers Associ- ation. The rest of the world should follow America's lead, considering the international respect our scientists enjoy, the relative openness of com- munication between them and their global associates, and, above all, the impregnable rationality and ele- mental nature of the concepts involved. Albert Schweitzer dated the epi- logue to his life history May 7, 1931 at Lambarene, site of his African jungle hospital. Fifty years ago. If we should now follow reason to his ethic and beyond, we just might join people everywhere on this little planet in such life -celebrating adven - tures as cooperative explorations of space and the oceans, international assaults on disease, and joint ven- tures to provide the world with abun- dant energy. Carl Sagan (1980) makes the important point that much military hardware and expertise could easily be switched into a space- exploration program. It could also be used in oceanographic study, of course. Our alternative to global cooperation is the expression of utter contempt for life: its destruction. And as more nations prepare to join the nuclear club, that ghastly prospect looms menacingly larger every day. We do not have another fifty years to indulge the insanity of our species. If he were alive today, Albert Schweitzer would certainly see a more urgent need for "each of us .-. to help to bring about deliver- ance." He would surely implore sci- entists, biology teachers above all, to help people regain "confidence in rational thinking," to recapture love for truth. His "willing and hoping" would demand inculcation in young- sters of Reverence for Life. He would expect the people who teach life science to become the scientists of survival.
