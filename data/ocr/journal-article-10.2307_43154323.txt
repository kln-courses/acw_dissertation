Affeldt University of Notre Dame I. INTRODUCTION: PHILOSOPHY, BEWITCHMENT, AND LANGUAGE At Philosophical Investigations §109, Wittgenstein famously characterizes philosophy as "a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language."1 Even without yet stopping to consider exactly what Wittgenstein means by the bewitchment of our intelligence or how he understands his practice of philosophy to battle against that bewitchment, this remark may be recognized as emblematic of a direction of thought which is pervasive throughout Philosophical Investigations. It is emblem- atic of that direction of Wittgenstein's thought in which he is concerned to show the extent of our subjection to various forms of captivation, confusion, emptiness, nonsense, mystification, and the like, to discover the sources of these forms of subjection, and to offer measures of liberation from them. As such, this remark provides one clear instance of moments throughout Philosophical Investigations which have encouraged many of its readers to 255</page><page sequence="2">feel that the text harbors some form of morally redemptive ambition and is involved, at least in part, in some form of morally redemptive work.2 However, given that the Investigations does not separately and explic- itly address such matters, readers who have discerned a redemptive dimen- sion within the text have faced difficulties in making very clear the character of its redemptive ambition, and yet greater difficulties in showing that and how any kind of redemptive work is being conducted within the details of the text itself. Accordingly, these readers have, for the most part, adopted one of the following two courses. Some have focused primarily upon the small range of so called meta-philosophical remarks within Philosophical Investigations or upon Wittgenstein's comparatively minor texts such as Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology ; and Religious Belief or the scattered remarks brought together by G. H. von Wright as Culture and Value , and have sought to extract some kind of morally redemptive vision from these remarks or texts. Others have focused upon more central texts, preeminently Philosophical Investigations and Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. However, they have also not undertaken to reveal a morally redemptive undertaking directly within these texts. Rather, they have in effect conceded that these text do not directly address issues of ethics or morality and have instead argued that various of their lessons about language, meaning, rationality, forms of life, and the like might be brought to ethics or prove useful in considering meta-ethical questions involving the nature of moral judgment, the rationality of moral argument, and the nature of the enterprise of ethics itself.3 Much of the work produced in following each of these courses has been productive and valuable. However, as productive and valuable as this work can be, unless a form of morally redemptive ambition and morally redemp- tive work can be shown to be both clearly present within and central to the major texts of Wittgenstein's later period, it will remain open to those of his readers who do not antecendently discern such an ambition in these texts, or who have no use for such an ambition, to regard any redemptive vision which might be extracted from his scattered remarks or any ethical or meta- ethical lessons which might be drawn from his major later texts as essen- tially separate from the primary philosophical aims of his work. The concern of this essay is, therefore, to begin to show the presence of what I understand to be a morally redemptive ambition and morally redemptive work which is central to and pervasive within the details of Philosophical Investigations .4 There are at least two immediate obstacles facing this project. First, as I have noted, the text does not separately and explicitly address these matters. Indeed, in his Preface Wittgenstein identifies the subjects of the Investigations as "the concepts of meaning, of understanding, of a proposition, of logic, the foundations of mathematics, states of conscious- 256</page><page sequence="3">ness, and other things" (ix). This just means, however, that we must arrive at a perspective on the text which will enable us to see that and how morally redemptive work is being directly undertaken in the details of Wittgenstein's treatments of these subjects. That is, we must come to see that and how the morally redemptive project is not an isolated dimension of Wittgenstein's work, but is seamlessly interwoven throughout Philosophical Investigations and is, accordingly, as multifaceted and complex as the detailed treatments of the various subjects through which it takes shape. A second immediate obstacle facing this project lies in the still prevail- ing institutional divisions between the analytical and the continental tradi- tions of philosophy. For the analytical tradition is best placed to deal with the technical details of the subjects which occupy the Investigations , but its methods and self-understanding are structured so as to occlude the morally redemptive work undertaken through those details. And the continental tra- dition is better placed to recognize the morally redemptive undertaking of the text, but its methods and self-understanding are structured so as to be ill- equipped to deal with the technical details which make that undertaking concrete and effective. I would like to hope, therefore, that this essay may contribute to the work of overcoming these institutional divisions and that it may encourage a sense of the value and desirability of such work. I have been suggesting that the morally redemptive undertaking of Philosophical Investigations can only be discovered in its details, and that the efficacy of this undertaking depends upon our engaging with those details. Accordingly, in bulk of this essay I will be working through the details of a small set of specific passages in order to explore one instance of Wittgenstein's redemptive work. Prior to turning to these passages, however, I want to consider a bit more fully Wittgenstein's claim at §109 that "phi- losophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language." In particular, I want to elaborate briefly two markedly different readings of this remark. For these two different readings issue in quite dif- ferent conceptions of any possible redemptive ambition of the text. On the first and most familiar reading, it suggests that our ordinary lan- guage is the source of the bewitchment of our intelligence. The idea is that ordinary language contains within itself traps of various kinds, and that these traps lay hold of our intelligence and lead us into confusion when we incautiously rely upon superficial features of ordinary language as a guide to understanding in philosophy. On this way of taking Wittgenstein's remark, it might be recast as "Language is the means of the bewitchment of our intelligence, and philosophy is a battle against that bewitchment."5 On the second reading of Wittgenstein's remark, it does not suggest that our language is the source of our captivity in thought but that it is, or can be, the means of our liberation. On this reading, that is, ordinary language is understood as the means or the tool with which philosophy battles the 257</page><page sequence="4">bewitchment of our intelligence and the source or sources of that bewitch- ment are left unspecified. So understood, Wittgenstein's claim might be recast as "Philosophy is the battle, by means of language, against the bewitchment of our intelligence."6 The first of these two readings places Wittgenstein in considerable alignment with a long tradition of thought in philosophy which regards ordi- nary language as inherently misleading and as unsuitable for the purposes of serious thought. This tradition extends from at least as early as Descartes's cautioning himself in the Second Meditation that "although I am considering these points within myself silently and without speaking, yet I stumble over words and am almost deceived by ordinary language," through Frege's development of a concept-script in order to free thought from the misconceptions with which "the means of expression of ordinary language, constituted as they are, saddle it," to at least as recently as the various cau- tions which have been entered against being misled about the nature of mind by the language of what is called "folk psychology."7 Wittgenstein's recurrence in the Investigations to the idea that our "forms of expression" mislead us may appear to provide grounds for such an alignment and to support the first reading of his remark at §109. In §90, for example, Wittgenstein suggests that we are misled by "analogies between the forms of expression [proper to] different regions of language." In this instance, our forms of expression are not judged to be inherently mis- leading within their proper regions of language. Rather, we are misled in our thinking in a given area due to analogies between the forms of expression proper to that area and forms of expression proper to another area. In other instances, however, Wittgenstein does appear to suggest that our forms of expression are inherently misleading. In §36, for example, he remarks that "where our language suggests a body and there is none: there, we should like to say, is a spirit ." Here it can seem as though our language holds open a space for a nonexistent body and so invites us, or even encourages us, to mistakenly fill that object-space in language with a spirit. And, to note sim- ply one further instance, in §94 Wittgenstein quite directly links our sense that "a proposition is a queer thing" with our forms of expression. He remarks that "our forms of expression prevent us in all sorts of ways from seeing that nothing out of the ordinary is involved [in a proposition], by sending us in pursuit of chimeras." If one adopts this first reading of Wittgenstein's remark, it will be clear, at least in outline, what it means to say that our intelligence is bewitched and how philosophy may battle against that bewitchment. To say that our intelligence is bewitched will be to say that, in philosophy, we are led into error and confusion by our ordinary language, by our reliance upon superfi- cial features of our forms of expression, and by our failure adequately to understand the workings of our language. Philosophy will battle against this 258</page><page sequence="5">bewitchment by showing that we fail to understand our ordinary language, that we have an inadequate view of its workings, and by providing us with a more complete and nuanced appreciation of the details of the workings of our language. Once those details have been provided, our philosophical errors and confusions will be dissolved and we will be released from the bewitchment of our intelligence.8 Further, if one adopts this reading of Wittgenstein's remark, the char- acter of any redemptive project which it supports will be circumscribed, clear, and hopeful. It will be circumscribed in being directed specifically toward releasing those engaged in certain forms of philosophical thought from the obscurities into which they are led by their failure adequately to understand the workings of our language. It will be clear in that, since the source of our bewitchments is understood to lie in our failure properly to understand the details of the workings of our language, the liberating dimen- sion of Wittgenstein's work will lodge simply in its enrichment of our understanding. Nothing further will be required. Finally, it will be hopeful in that, on this reading, we are permitted to imagine that we may eventually command a completely clear and comprehensive view of the workings of our language as a whole. At that point, we will be finally and fully free of all philosophical confusion and our intelligence will be finally and fully free of the threat of bewitchment. If one adopts the second reading of Wittgenstein's remark, matters are not so clear, circumscribed, or hopeful. It will not be clear what it means to say that our intelligence is bewitched or how it comes to be bewitched. Accordingly, it will not be clear whether this malady is reserved exclusively for those engaged in philosophical thought. It will be equally unclear what it means to say that philosophy, by means of language, may battle this bewitchment and how it is to do so. Finally, since it will not be clear how our intelligence is bewitched or how philosophy battles this bewitchment, it will not be clear that there is any prospect of arriving at a full and final release from this bewitchment. Given these consequences of adopting this second reading, it may well seem that there is nothing to recommend it. However, it is this reading of Wittgenstein's remark that informs my effort here to begin articulating what I understand to be the morally redemptive work of Philosophical Investigations. My reasons for adopting this second reading over the first are primarily the following. First, notwithstanding some of the apparent evidence to the contrary which I have noted, I think that Wittgenstein does not maintain that our ordinary language contains traps simply lying within it which bewitch our intelligence. Rather, Wittgenstein is concerned to understand how and why we are led to distort our ordinary language and our relation to it, to in this way make our language a scene of traps for our intelligence, and then to 259</page><page sequence="6">project the cause of the bewitchment of our intelligence back into language and to maintain that it already contained traps lying within it. Throughout the Investigations, that is, Wittgenstein is concerned to highlight and to treat different expressions of what his work shows to be a fundamental human drive to bewitch our own intelligence which is manifest in our relation to our language. This fundamental human drive to bewitch our own intelli- gence, or as Wittgenstein says at §109 "a drive [einem Trieb ] to misunder- stand," is both revealed in and expressed in the insistent, often desperate, emptiness and confusion that Wittgenstein recurrently encounters in the interlocutory voices of the text.9 Second, insofar as Wittgenstein is concerned to bring out a fundamen- tal human drive to misunderstand or to bewitch our own intelligence, the burden of his redemptive work will not lie in simply providing understand- ing, and philosophy, as he practices it, will not battle the bewitchment of our intelligence primarily by providing us with a more complete understanding of the workings of our language. Rather Wittgenstein's philosophical prac- tice will work to battle the bewitchment of our intelligence by seeking to discover and to combat the various sources of our drive to misunderstand and to distort our language and our relation to it. Wittgenstein's redemptive work is not directed in the first instance toward philosophical difficulties themselves, but toward uncovering and treating the multiple and diverse human fantasies, cravings, dissatisfactions, and the like which lie behind the first steps into philosophical confusion, emptiness, fixation, insistence, and the like. Further, insofar as Wittgenstein shows specific forms of philosoph- ical confusion and emptiness to express forms of a fundamental human drive to misunderstand, he also reveals the ubiquity, and even in one sense the naturalness, of philosophical confusion and emptiness to the human being upon stopping to take thought or to reflect.10 Therefore, while Wittgenstein illustrates expressions of this drive and their consequences as they manifest themselves in forms of philosophy, he is not addressing a spe- cific malady of a narrowly circumscribed group, and his redemptive ambi- tions will be directed beyond the task of liberating professional philosophers from the various darknesses into which they cast themselves. These claims will be more fully developed and supported throughout the course of this essay. I would like, however, to mention a third reason for my resisting the first reading of Wittgenstein's remark at §109 and for adopting the second as informing my conception of the redemptive work of Philosophical Investigations. It seems to me that Frege and Carnap certainly, early Wittgenstein arguably, and Austin in certain moments, harbored the hope that a suffi- ciently accurate appreciation of the details of the workings of our language would completely banish the bewitchments of our intelligence. However, I do not see that the later Wittgenstein harbored any such hope for a full and 260</page><page sequence="7">final peace. Rather, insofar as he is concerned to show that human beings are possessed of a continuous drive to bewitch themselves, his philosophi- cal practice must itself be understood as a necessarily continuous battle against this drive. That is, I take it that part of what we are meant to learn from the 693 sections of Part One of the Investigations is that there are no limits to the ways in which we bewitch ourselves. We are shown in these sections that we do so continuously upon stopping to take thought and in hundreds of apparently unremarkable ways and moments. Accordingly, our recovery to ourselves must also be continuous and the work of hundreds of otherwise unremarkable moments of recovered sense. We might say that Wittgenstein accepts the message of the pun in the title of Kant's essay on "Perpetual Peace." Namely, if a full and final peace is ever to be found, it is found only in death.11 II. CAPTIVATING PICTURES In the remainder of this essay I will be elaborating one instance of what I understand to be the redemptive work which is being conducted within the details of Philosophical Investigations. In particular, I will be focusing on a small range of Wittgenstein's remarks about relations between pictures and language and about the wish to find in a certain conception of pictures a model for the working of language. I will be developing through these remarks one line of thought about how and why we bewitch our own intel- ligence and about how Wittgenstein's philosophical practice may be under- stood to battle this bewitchment.12 At §115 Wittgenstein has this: "A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably." This passage raises a number of immediate questions. Perhaps most immediately it raises questions about what Wittgenstein means by a picture, what it means to say that a picture lay in our language, and how we are to understand the striking idea that language repeats a pic- ture to us. I will return to each of these questions in due course. However, putting them to one side for the moment, this passage offers a reasonably clear instance of something that might be thought of as a bewitched intelli- gence. Whatever exactly Wittgenstein means in speaking of our being held captive by a picture, there is a clear suggestion that our intelligence is some- how taken hold of and thwarted by the picture. We are unable to free our- selves from the picture, to get outside of it, and to think in any terms other than those which the picture seems to offer. Even though this passage provides a reasonably clear instance of a bewitched intelligence, it may nevertheless seem to be a poor passage for my purposes. For it can seem clearly to invite and to support what I have 261</page><page sequence="8">been calling the first reading of Wittgenstein's remark about philosophy and the battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language. It can seem clearly to suggest, that is, that it is simply a fact about our lan- guage that there is a picture, whatever it turns out to be, lying in it and that it is precisely this fact about our language which is responsible for the bewitchment of our intelligence. We are held captive by this picture pre- cisely because it is lying in our language. However much we might try to get outside of it, we inevitably encounter language repeating this picture to us inexorably. Any attempt to escape is thwarted by language itself. I have begun with this passage, in part, precisely because it can readily seem to suggest this view. Indeed, together with passages such as §191, in which Wittgenstein speaks of philosophical confusion "as the result of the crossing of different pictures," this passage might be thought of as among the strongest sources of support for a purportedly general Wittgensteinian lesson about the philosophical deceptiveness of certain of our forms of lan- guage and for a general Wittgensteinian warning about the philosophical dangers of what he calls pictures. Further, understood in the manner which I have sketched, this passage may well suggest that, for Wittgenstein, the liberation of our intelligence will depend upon completely eliminating pic- tures from our language. However, I do not believe that this passage supports either the line of interpretation that I have just sketched or the general conclusions that may be drawn from that interpretation. Indeed, I do not believe that Wittgenstein harbors any wholesale antipathy toward pictures. The term "picture" [Bild] is recurrent throughout Philosophical Investi- gations and is one of the budget of terms of description and of criticism that Wittgenstein's work has added to our philosophical lexicon. It is important to recall, however, that this term is not used in any single sense throughout the Investigations and that it is not invariably used as a term of criticism or to suggest a site of philosophical confusion. The following few instances may serve as reminders of the range of this term and of the range of Wittgenstein's attitudes toward pictures. The term "picture" first occurs quite casually in § 1 of the Investigations . Immediately following the opening short quotation from the Confessions in which Augustine recounts his memory of learning language, Wittgenstein remarks: "In these words, it seems to me, we find a particular picture of the essence of human language."13 Here Wittgenstein apparently uses the term "picture" simply to designate a general and perhaps sketchy account that we might provide of some matter. Such a general and sketchy account may, of course, lead to confusion if it is mistakenly taken to represent, or is pressed into philosophical service as, a complete and fully accurate account in this instance of language or of the essence of language. However, there is no suggestion here that this picture is inherently misleading or that it is simply 262</page><page sequence="9">lying in our language waiting to capture our intelligence and to lead us into confusion.14 In other instances Wittgenstein uses the term "picture" quite literally to speak of various types of drawings, paintings, and images. There is a picture of a boxer (p. 11), a picture of an old man walking up a steep path (p. 54), a portrait and a genre painting (§522), "two pictures of a rose in the dark" (§515), a "[picture] of a machine [used] to symbolize a particular action of the machine" (§193), and the like.15 We might also include as related to this class of instances Wittgenstein's remark that "the human body is the best picture of the human soul" (p. 178). I will return to some of these passages below. However, in this class of instances too, while we may be misled in our thinking by imagining that the functioning of these pictures is more clear and direct than it actually is, such pictures do not lie in our language nor are they inherently misleading. They are simply pictures. In a third class of instances, Wittgenstein uses the term "picture" in connection with elements of what might be called a mythology of ourselves and of certain phenomena which have become quite natural to us. This is the sense of the term in Wittgenstein's asking: "If the picture of thought in the head can force itself upon us, then why not much more that of thought in the soul?" (p. 178) It is also the sense of the term in his inviting us to "think of the picture of blindness as darkness in the soul or in the head of the blind man" (§424). Furthermore, while Wittgenstein does not explicitly use the term picture when he suggests the image of a rule as "a visible section of rails invisibly laid to infinity" (§218), this sense of picture as part of a natu- ral mythology seems to be at work in this instance as well. These kinds of cases, perhaps, more closely approach the sense of the term involved in the idea that a picture holds us captive. One might not want to suggest that such pictures "lie in our language"; however, insofar as these pictures have become part of a natural mythology, they do exert a kind of force on our thought and imagination. Further, while we are not likely to simply forget that these pictures are, as Wittgenstein says at §221, "mytho- logical description^]," he does suggest that their naturalness to us and their imagistic vividness may mislead us. Wittgenstein remarks that "a picture [is] in the foreground, but the sense lies far in the background; that is, the appli- cation of the picture is not easy to survey" (§422). These pictures come to the foreground in our thinking and may either provide an illusion of clarity about the nature of various phenomena or misdirect inquiry into the nature of those phenomena. However, even in these cases Wittgenstein does not seek to eliminate such pictures. On the contrary, he says of them: "The pic- ture is there. And I am not disputing its validity in any particular case. - Only I also want to understand the application of the picture" (§423). With these reminders in place, I want to return to §115: "A picture held 263</page><page sequence="10">us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us inexorably." Closer attention to the com- plexities of this passage within its context will allow us to appreciate that it does not support the line of interpretation I sketched above and will take us some considerable distance in beginning to understand at least one of Wittgenstein's accounts of the ways in which and the reasons why we bewitch our own intelligence. In first introducing §115 I noted its striking image of language repeat- ing a picture to us inexorably. I will have more to say about this feature of the passage shortly. But in order to begin considering this passage more fully, I want to note that the image of repetition is part of what serves to establish the linkage between this passage and those which immediately pre- cede it. In §§113-14 we have the following: "But this is how it is - " I say to myself over and over again. I feel as though, if only I could fix my gaze absolutely sharply on this fact, get it in focus, I must grasp the essence of the matter. ( Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 4.5): "The general form of propositions is: This is how things are." - That is the kind of proposition that one repeats to oneself countless times. One thinks that one is tracing the outline of the thing's nature over and over again, and one is merely tracing round the frame through which we look at it. Central as the evident images of repetition are in these passages, the linkage between §115 and §§113-14 is not exhausted by them. Visual images are equally prominent in §§113-14. In §113 we have the idea of trying to fix our gaze absolutely sharply on a fact, on "this," and of trying to get this sup- posed fact into focus, and in §114 we have the no less explicitly visual image of tracing around the frame through which we look at something. Further, and importantly, in §§113-14 together we are presented with a very close alignment, if not an identification, of the ideas of a fact, a proposition, and a picture. Accordingly, the idea of the repetition of a picture which first appears explicitly in §115 is already implicitly present in §§113-14. That is, in saying to ourselves over and over again "But this is how it is" as well as in repeating countless times that "The general form of propositions is: This is how things are" we are, in effect, incessantly repeating a picture of the nature of language. Locating §115 in the context of these two preceding passages allows us to recognize that it contains a number of closely connected and quite pivotal reversals. In §§113-14, /produce for myself a picture of the nature of lan- guage and I repeat this picture to myself over and over. Indeed, my repeti- tion of the picture is depicted as an integral part of my effort to produce the picture for myself. It is part of my effort to bring the picture before myself, 264</page><page sequence="11">to get it in focus and to fix my gaze upon it absolutely sharply. Further, the fact that I must repeat the picture over and over suggests that I encounter some difficulty in bringing the picture into clear focus and in fixing my gaze on it absolutely sharply. And the fact that I encounter this difficulty in turn suggests that the picture I am working to produce for myself is neither sta- ble nor simply given, it is not simply present before me. This picture, then, is importantly unlike, for example, "the picture of thought in the head" or "the picture of blindness as darkness in the soul or in the head of the blind man" or even the picture of a rule as "a visible section of rails invisibly laid to infinity." These picture are in some sense natural to us. Wittgenstein says that they "are there," are in the foreground, and that they can "force [them- selves] upon us." With respect to the picture in §§113-14, however, a con- tinuous effort on my part is required to conjure the picture into being and into focus. The picture is apparently not naturally in the foreground forcing itself upon me. It seems, rather, that I must force the picture into being. In §115, each of these features of §§113-14 is suddenly reversed. The picture is no longer something I am working to create for myself, and it is not I who repeat it over and over. In §115 the picture is said to "lay in our language," and it is language, not my language or our language but simply language, which "repeats it to us inexorably." Further, there is no longer any effort on my part required to keep the picture before me. The picture now simply is before me and holds me captive. These reversals indicate that §115 is not a neutral description of the nature of our language and of how a picture lies within it and holds us cap- tive. It is not, that is, an account of the source and nature of our captivity or bewitchment offered from a position beyond captivity or bewitchment. On the contrary, §115 is a description offered from within a process of self- captivation and self-bewitchment which has begun in §§113-14, and it rep- resents a profound deepening of the bewitchment of our own intelligence.16 Additional support for the claim that in §§113-14 we are involved in self-bewitchment will begin to emerge in the following section when I con- sider the specific picture that we are working to produce for ourselves. However, I would like to suggest at this point that, even without invoking Freud's theorization of repetition and its differences from both remember- ing and working-through, we may recognize our involvement in self-capti- vation and self-bewitchment in our urgent, repetitive efforts to bring into being a picture which resists our efforts, a picture which is apparently not natural to us or forced upon us. Our self-bewitchment is at one and the same time revealed in and expressed in the evident desperation of our repetition of the refrain that the general form of propositions is "This is how things are."17 It is the fact that by §115 we are already deeply involved in self- bewitchment that produces the ideas that there is a picture which holds us 265</page><page sequence="12">captive simply lying in our language and that language repeats the picture to us inexorably. That is, Wittgenstein means us to recognize §115 as an explanation that we offer ourselves of our own self-captivating and self- bewitching activity in §113 and §114. We project our own urgent repetition of a picture that we are trying to create into language and, in doing so, cre- ate for ourselves the idea that there is a picture lying in our language and the phantasm of a language which repeats this picture to us inexorably. More specifically, we create for ourselves the phantasm of language as a kind of structure, or even a kind of mechanism, which contains pictures within itself and which, because it contains these pictures within itself, mechanistically repeats them to us inexorably.18 Having projected our own urgent repetition of a picture into language, we then tell ourselves that we have found the pic- ture in language. We tell ourselves that this picture has always been lying in our language and that the fact of its lying in our language is why we have been captivated by it and why we have been repeating it over and over. Since it lay in our language, we could not do otherwise. Language itself has been repeating the picture to us and indeed through us in each proposition that we utter. This explanation that we offer ourselves in §115 is, however, in bad faith. It denies our role in the production of this picture and of our own cap- tivity as these have been depicted in §113 and §114. It locates the source of the bewitchment of our intelligence in a supposed fact about language and it represents our bewitchment as falling upon us from language. We capti- vate ourselves with a picture, and then tell ourselves that the picture captures us. Furthermore, this explanation profoundly deepens our bewitchment. For in misrepresenting the source and nature of our bewitchment, it leads us to seek release from that bewitchment in a direction in which release is not to be found. In particular, it leads us to conceive of release as coming through a reform of our language or through simply attaining a greater level of understanding of the workings of our language apart from working to com- prehend and to address what Wittgenstein wishes us to recognize as the source and nature of this expression of our persistent "drive to misunder- stand." But when we no longer correctly recognize the source and nature of our difficulties or the means of their resolution, what hope of release remains? EI. PICTURING PICTURES The interpretation of §§113-15 that I have sketched suggests that, contrary to initial appearances, §115 does not clearly support the ideas involved in what I have called the first reading of Wittgenstein's claim that philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language. 266</page><page sequence="13">Indeed, it suggests a quite specific critique of those ideas. It suggests that we wish to conceive of language as simply containing traps which bewitch our intelligence in order to deny our own active role in the production of those traps and of our own bewitchment, in order to, in short, deny our "drive to misunderstand." However, the import of these passages is more general and more per- vasive. In order to begin to bring out the more general and pervasive import of these passages, I need to highlight an aspect of §§113-14 which I have not to this point specifically emphasized. In particular, the picture that we work to create for ourselves in §§113-14 is a picture of the nature and work- ing of language which Wittgenstein associates with the picture theory of lan- guage from the Tractatus. For the Wittgenstein of the Tractatus, to say that the general form of a proposition is "This is how things are," is to say that the general form in which language operates is through propositions which have sense and communicate in virtue of picturing states of affairs. Accordingly, in §§113-14 we are working to produce for ourselves and to make secure for ourselves a picture of language as operating through pictures. But why, according to Wittgenstein, do we so insistently want this pic- ture? In order to begin to respond to this question, we need to consider the prior question: How do we imagine, or want to imagine, that pictures work and carry meaning? Wittgenstein has quite a lot to say about how we are inclined to imag- ine that pictures work and about why we are drawn to the idea that language operates as we imagine pictures to operate. Here I want to isolate just two intimately related ideas to which he recurs several times throughout the Investigations. The first idea, roughly put, is that the sense or meaning of a picture is absolutely clear and immediately present. Accordingly, if a proposition is a picture, then its sense is also absolutely clear and immediately present. This idea emerges in embryonic form as early as §6, in Wittgenstein's discussion of ostensive teaching of words. In response to his own question about what might be meant in saying that "ostensive teaching of words can be said to establish a connection between the word and the thing," Wittgenstein continues: "Well, it can mean various things; but one very likely thinks first of all that a picture of the object comes before the child's mind when it hears the word." In §6 Wittgenstein's discussion moves fairly quickly away from the idea that understanding a word may be a matter of a picture coming before the mind. However, in §§139-41, Wittgenstein returns to this idea and offers a more extensive discussion of the thought that a picture clearly determines sense. In §139, Wittgenstein is considering a set of questions surrounding the ability to understand a word. He asks: "What really comes before our mind 267</page><page sequence="14">when we understand a word?" Following this question there is a long dash, which often indicates a pause to gather thoughts, and then: "Isn't it some- thing like a picture? Can't it be a picture?" The suggestion that what comes before the mind is "something like a picture" arises in response to the fact that we are often able to understand a word immediately, or, as Wittgenstein says, "in a flash." He remarks: "When someone says the word 'cube' to me, for example, I know what he means." Further, I know what he means clearly and immediately. The idea that what comes before the mind is something like a picture suggests itself as an explanation of this transparency and immediacy of understanding. In response to the suggestion that what comes before the mind is some- thing like a picture, Wittgenstein's first move, which is familiar throughout the Investigations, is to replace the idea of something like a picture in the mind with an actual picture, in this instance with a drawing on paper. In making this move he works to force us to remain faithful to the ways in which actual pictures work, and thus blocks any temptation to explain our ability to understand a word by attributing to the quasi-picture in the mind various mysterious powers. Wittgenstein then continues by raising problems about whether and how an actual picture can account for our understanding. Most centrally, he points out that, in order for the picture of the cube, in itself, to account for our understanding of the word "cube," the picture would have to carry within itself the correct method for projecting the pic- ture onto objects. However, the picture itself carries no such method of pro- jection. Wittgenstein asks: "In what sense can this picture [of a cube] fit or fail to fit a use of the word 'cube'?" He continues: Perhaps you say: "It's quite simple; - if that picture occurs to me and I point to a triangular prism for instance, and say it is a cube, then this use of the word doesn't fit the picture." - But doesn't it fit? I have purposely so chosen the example that it is quite easy to imagine a method of projection according to which the picture does fit after all. Wittgenstein's point here is clearly not that pictures are, in general, unclear or that they cannot convey a sense clearly and, in one sense, imme- diately. Quite often, pictures can and do convey a sense clearly and imme- diately, and it is just this fact that leads us to imagine that a picture might explain our understanding of a word. Wittgenstein's point is rather that the power of a picture to convey sense clearly and immediately depends upon our understanding how the picture is being used, how it is being applied, and so how the picture is to be taken. This idea is wonderfully illustrated in the following example which Wittgenstein attaches to his discussion at §139. "I see a picture," he remarks. "It represents an old man walking up a steep path leaning on a stick. - How? Might it not have looked just the same if he had been sliding 268</page><page sequence="15">downhill in that position? Perhaps a Martian would describe the picture so. I do not need to explain why we do not describe it so." Often, as in this case, given a background of our familiarity with facts about our world and with what people are likely to wish to convey, it is evident without any special thought how a picture is being used and so how it is to be taken. However, this does not alter the fact that the sense of the picture depends upon our grasp of how it is being used. And the picture does not, of itself, tell how it is being used. But if the power of a picture to convey sense depends upon our under- standing how it is being used and so how it is to be taken, a picture will not successfully explain our understanding of a word. For exactly what requires explanation is our ability to understand how a word is being used and how it is to be taken. These considerations are more or less familiar. However, Wittgenstein's need to enter a reminder that the sense of a picture depends upon how the picture is being used takes me to the second, and perhaps somewhat less familiar, idea that I want to isolate about how we imagine pictures to work and about why we might wish to understand language as operating accord- ing to this conception of pictures. At §523 Wittgenstein remarks: "I should like to say 'What a picture tells me is itself.' That is, its telling me something consists in its own struc- ture, in its own lines and colors." To imagine that a picture tells me itself, and that its telling consists in its own structure, is to imagine that a picture carries its own meaning. More specifically, it is to imagine that a picture may mean entirely apart from any connection with its being used by anyone, on a specific occasion, to mean one thing rather than another. However, Wittgenstein wants us to see that this is an illusion. Wittgenstein's first example of an actual picture, quite early in Philosophical Investigations, is the following. Imagine a picture representing a boxer in a particular stance. Now, this picture can be used to tell someone how he should stand, should hold himself; or how he should not hold himself; or how a particular man did stand in such-and-such place; and so on. One might (using the language of chemistry) call this pic- ture a proposition-radical. This will be how Frege thought of the "assumption", (p. 11) Initially, these remarks may seem to allow that a picture may clearly repre- sent, or mean, apart from our understanding the use to which the picture is being put, while simply urging that it will not be clear what we are to do with the picture until we understand the specific purpose for which it is being introduced. However, the fact that Wittgenstein introduces this exam- ple in the context of criticizing Frege's understanding of an assertion shows that his point in this example lies deeper. 269</page><page sequence="16">Wittgenstein's criticism of Frege's understanding of assertion focuses on the idea that an "assertion consists of two actions, entertaining [a thought] and asserting [the thought]" (§22). In challenging this idea, Wittgenstein remarks: "But 'that such-and-such is the case' is not a sentence in our language - so far it is not a move in the language-game" (§22). This may seem an especially poor criticism of Frege. For Frege's idea might itself be expressed by saying that a thought, or what he also calls an assump- tion, is not yet a move in the language-game. It is, for him, the assertion of the thought, or the denying of the thought, or the questioning of the thought, and the like which makes a move in the language-game. Frege's concern is to argue that, in order for an assertion, denial, question, and so on, to make a determinate move in the language-game, and in order to make sense of the idea that one and the same thought is asserted, denied, or questioned, the thought must have a determinate sense which is specifiable apart from the assertion, denial, or question.19 However, it is precisely this Fregean idea that there can be a merely entertained thought or assumption with determinate sense apart from the assertion that Wittgenstein is criticizing.20 His argument, baldly stated, is that there is only a thought with determinate sense in making a move in the language-game, only insofar as words are either used or may be understood as being used by a specific person, on a specific occasion, for a specific pur- pose. Wittgenstein is not arguing that apart from these conditions the indi- vidual words are without meaning. The individual words will mean what a dictionary says they mean. His argument is that, apart from these conditions, the words do not express any determinate thought. In order for the words to express a determinate thought, one must be able to understand what some- one is, or may be, saying with them. And for that, they must be tied, at least in imagination, to a particular person and to his or her circumstances and purposes. Faced with a group of words, one may well be able to imagine a wide range of circumstances in which and purposes for which an individual might assert them. In imagining each of these circumstances and purposes, one will make of the words a thought with a determinate sense. However, in itself, the group of words does not constitute a determinate thought. Indeed, it simply does not constitute a thought at all, for an indeterminate thought is not a thought, not a thought.21 In the context of this argument, it is clear that the point of Wittgenstein's remarks concerning the picture of the boxer is the following. The picture's having a determinate sense, its representing anything in particular, is inex- tricably bound together with the use of the picture for a particular purpose. Apart from its use, there simply is no determinate sense of the picture. The picture's picturing anything in particular at all depends upon its use. Insofar as it seems otherwise, this is simply because we have, in imagination, sup- plied the picture with a use. As Wittgenstein remarks at §291, the picture in 270</page><page sequence="17">itself simply "portray[s] how a thing looks, what it is like." In itself, as Wittgenstein goes on to say in the same passage, the picture is "idle." One might say, as Wittgenstein says of the ultimately illusory unasserted thought at §22, that it "does not serve to tell me anything." It does not serve to tell me anything because it is not being used by anyone to say anything. Or, rather, apart from its employment by someone to say something in particu- lar, there is no determinate "it" to do any telling. IV. LANGUAGE-GAMES AND THE CONDITIONS OF SPEECH I have been suggesting that Wittgenstein frequently invokes examples of pictures in the context of discussing language, in significant part, because a picture can seem to represent the realization of at least one dimension of our wishes for, or fantasies of, propositions and language. A picture, that is, can seem a bearer of clear and immediate sense, a vehicle which carries mean- ing clearly and unproblematically, and it can seem to represent such a vehi- cle because it seems to carry its meaning entirely within itself - "in its own structure, in its own lines and colors." To apprehend a picture, it can seem, just is to grasp its meaning, to see its meaning. In challenging this picture of pictures, Wittgenstein does not undertake to show that pictures cannot clearly convey sense, but rather that their doing so is dependent upon our appreciation of the use to which a picture is being put. Accordingly, this challenge forms an integral part of Wittgenstein's larger effort throughout the Investigations to illustrate that and how mean- ing in language is tied to our use of words, to the human activity of speak- ing language, or to what he calls making a move in a language-game.22 We can now see, therefore, that for Wittgenstein our insistent drive in §§113-14 toward a fantasy of language as operating according to a particular concep- tion of pictures reveals a wish for the possibility of meaning in language apart from the necessities of use and purified of any connection to individ- ual persons, circumstances, or purposes. It reveals a wish for the possibility of meaning in language apart from the necessities involved in making a move in a language-game. But this is so far quite abstract and schematic. In order to understand more fully what, for Wittgenstein, is ultimately at issue in our drive to understand language as operating according to our conception of pictures, we need a more specific account of what I have called the necessities involved in making a move in a language-game. First, however, I want to make two preliminary points about the effort to understand what is involved in making a move in a language-game. At §23 Wittgenstein remarks that "the term 'language-gamč' is meant to bring 271</page><page sequence="18">into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a form of life." In linking the idea of language-game with the idea of form of life, as well as in more narrowly contesting specific attempts to understand engaging in a language-game as simply a function of the use of particular words or in terms of appeal to an ultimately mysterious mental act of meaning in the preceding §§19-21 and elsewhere, Wittgenstein is sug- gesting that it is a mistake to attempt to specify any set of necessary and suf- ficient conditions upon making a move in a language-game. Such an attempt would be tantamount to an effort to offer a general philosophical explana- tion of how meaning is possible and of how language works. But Wittgenstein works throughout the Investigations to show that there is no sense to such an effort, for no wholly general question about how meaning is possible which such an effort would seek to answer can be given sense. The effort to offer a wholly general explanation of how meaning is possible or of how language works only seems necessary or to have sense on the basis of a prior severing of the connection between our uses of language and our form of life, and once that connection has been severed no question about meaning or explanation of meaning even anything in particular can have sense. Further, and this is the second preliminary point that I want to make, in linking the idea of language-game with the idea of form of life Wittgenstein makes clear that there will be real difficulties in understanding what is involved in making a move in a language-game. For understanding this mat- ter will be inseparable from understanding the entire form of life within which language-games take shape and which they themselves both shape and express. Accordingly, my concern here is simply to say enough about what is involved in making a move in a language-game, about how making a move in a language-game is bound together with conditions in our lives as speakers and actors, to bring into focus a couple of specific and, to my mind, insufficiently appreciated aspects of this idea. To this end I want to look specifically, if briefly, at some of the most salient conditions on the language-game of telling. In this I am guided by Wittgenstein's remark at §363 that we "regard it much too much as a matter of course that one can tell anything to anyone," and heeding his questions "But how is telling done? When are we said to tell anything? - What is the language-game of telling?" I do not mean to suggest that telling is a kind of master language-game. However, I focus on telling because it involves two dimensions which are clearly central to many acts of speech. In particular, telling involves the dimension of counting or tallying, which might be thought of most basically as bringing objects and experience under concepts through counting them as one thing rather than another. And telling involves the dimension of recounting or accounting, which might be thought of most basically as addressing oneself and one's counting of objects and experience 272</page><page sequence="19">to others.23 In virtue of involving these two dimensions, telling might be said to represent a kind of basic language-game, and the necessities involved in the language-game of telling will be, at least at a general level, informative of the necessities involved in engaging in a wider range of lan- guage-games.24 If we begin from the idea that to tell is to inform someone of something or to direct attention to something, then perhaps the most immediate condi- tion on telling is that one must be in a position to tell what is told to the other. But then what are the conditions on being in a position to tell some- thing to another? These conditions will include at least the following. First, there must be something that one has to tell. That is, one must know some- thing, or have noticed, been struck, amused, interested, surprised, alarmed, heartened, or the like, by something. Second, what one has to tell must be something that the other is in a position to receive. That is, one must know, believe, imagine, surmise, hope, or the like, that the other is in a position to comprehend what you tell and, equally importantly, to be informed, inter- ested, struck, amused, surprised, alarmed, heartened, and the like by what you tell or by what you direct attention toward. We might say, generally, that telling depends equally upon difference and similarity in the positions of the parties, and that in telling, one is articulating that difference and counting on that similarity. Telling depends upon difference in position in that, if there is to be anything to tell and so if one is to be able to tell, there must be some- thing one knows, has noticed, been struck by, amused by, and the like, which the other does not yet know, has not yet noticed, been struck by, seen what there is to be amused in, and the like. This is at least part of why undertaking to tell another something can sometimes give offense. "You think that you can tell me, i.e., that I don't already know, haven't already noticed, that! Who do you think I am?" Telling depends upon similarity in position in that, if one is to be able to tell, the other must be able to under- stand what is told as well as why it is told when and how it is. That is, the other must be able to understand that there is, or why one might have thought there to be, room to tell and reason to tell just what is told in the specific circumstances. This is at least part of why undertaking to tell another something can sometimes fail. "What are you saying?' "I don't get it." "I don't get your drift." Or even simply, "Huh?"25 In telling, then, one is articulating a specific relationship between one- self and another by articulating one's own position as well as the position that one imagines the other to occupy. This articulating of a specific rela- tionship between oneself and another importantly involves various forms of self-revelation. In telling you this and in telling it as I do here and now, I reveal something of myself in revealing my judgment of what, in the given circumstances, I find noteworthy, surprising, interesting, amusing, and the like, and I reveal something of myself in revealing my judgment of your 273</page><page sequence="20">position, of what you might also find noteworthy, surprising, interesting, amusing, and the like, and have not already noticed. Further, to speak of revealing one's judgment of what can be told or of what is worth telling in given circumstances and between particular individuals is to emphasize the fact that telling takes place within a field of open possibilities. Or better, it is to emphasize the fact that telling takes place among individuals who rec- ognize possibilities, who recognize that different features of a circumstance might stand out as significant and that this significance might itself be taken differently. In telling, one is opening up and articulating this field of possi- bilities between oneself and the other. One is opening up and articulating the field of possibilities for salient responses, challenges to how the circum- stances in which one speaks might be understood, rearticulations of one's own position and the position of the other, and, in general, for the continu- ation of conversation. Bearing in mind this background of a field of possi- bilities that is invoked and articulated in telling, I believe that we can also say that in telling I reveal something of myself in revealing my desire, as well as something of the shape of my desire, for your recognition of the specific position that I am taking and in revealing my desire to know your position.26 In articulating the position that I am taking and my judgment of the relationship between us in telling, I am projecting the ground of judgment and of desire from which I speak and so projecting the ground of my intel- ligibility. The sense of my telling, of what specifically I am telling in using the words that I do as I do in just these circumstances, depends upon my projecting this ground through my revelation of myself and of my position. If you are to understand what I tell, you must be able to understand my telling. And if you are to understand my telling, you must understand, or be able to gather, the position that I am assuming in speaking. You must be able to discover the ground of intelligibility that I project in speaking. That is, your understanding what specifically my words might mean in the particu- lar circumstances is inseparable from understanding what I mean and what I am doing with my words.27 One can, perhaps, say anything at all to another, or at least at another. However, one can only tell another something if the other is able to comprehend what is told, and that will be inseparably connected with understanding you and understanding your telling when and as you do. That telling is possible - that we are, for the most part, able to discover the ground of intelligibility that others project in speaking and hence able to understand what they are saying - expresses what Wittgenstein at §§241-42 calls our agreement in judgment and in form of Ufe. It expresses the fact that we are, for the most part, agreed in what we judge noteworthy, surprising, interesting, amusing, and the like in given circumstances, that we are, for the most part, able to determine what another might not have noticed, been sur- 274</page><page sequence="21">prised by, interested in, amused by, and the like in given circumstances, and that we are, for the most part, able to determine what, in given circum- stances, another might have judged noteworthy, surprising, interesting, amusing, and the like and why.28 By way of illustrating these brief remarks, I would like to consider, no less briefly, Wittgenstein's famously puzzling remark from Part Two of Philosophical Investigations : "If a lion could talk we could not understand him" (p. 223). It is important to bear in mind here that Wittgenstein is speaking of a lion, and not of what we might imagine as a human in the body of a lion, and that he does not say that we could not understand the words the lion utters, but that we could not understand him. The considera- tions I have been developing suggest two lines of thought about why we could not understand a lion who utters words we do understand. The first line of thought bears on an understanding of Wittgenstein's remark that takes it to allow that there is sense in the idea of a talking lion and to declare a limit to our capacities for understanding. Here we allow that the Hon is projecting the ground of his intelligibility in talking, but the claim is that we cannot discover that ground. Briefly, we cannot discover the ground that the lion is imagined to be projecting in talking because we can- not imagine what he might have to say, or why he might have any one thing to say rather than any other. And we cannot imagine what he might have to say or why he might have any one thing to say rather than any other because we cannot imagine what position he might be assuming in speaking and what position he might imagine that the one to whom he speaks stands in to him. Suppose, to take an apparently strong counterexample, we were to hear the lion pronounce the words "I am going to eat you," perhaps with a throaty growl in the voice and an eager gleam in the eye. This seems intel- ligible enough, and indeed the words certainly are intelligible. But to imag- ine that we understand the lion, understand what he is saying or indeed that he is speaking to us at all, is to transform the lion into a person in the body of a lion. It is to do so by imagining that the lion is taking up a comprehen- sible position toward us in speaking. But this is not, at least not obviously, imaginable of any actual lion. It is easy enough to imagine why a lion may try eat us, but it is not clear that we can imagine why an actual lion would care to tell us that it is going to eat us. Why would it want us to recognize this desire, to recognize this position? Why would an actual lion care that we understand this, and how would it imagine that we might care to understand? We will not be able to discover the ground of intelligibility that a lion is pro- jecting in speaking because our forms of life and our reasons for talking are too different for us to be able to find our feet with the lion. But if we cannot discover the ground of intelligibility that the lion is projecting in speaking, if we cannot imagine the position that he is assuming (toward us) in speak- ing, then however clearly we might understand the dictionary meanings of 275</page><page sequence="22">the individual words that he utters, we will not be able to understand what he is saying with those words. And if we cannot understand him and what he is saying with his words, then we will not be able to attach any determi- nate meaning to his words, to understand that or how the lion says any one thing rather than another. The second line of thought bears on a reading of Wittgenstein's remark which does not take it to declare a limit to our capacities for understanding, but rather to deny the comprehensibility of the idea of a lion talking. In terms of the concepts that I have tried to put in play, I would put the thought here as follows. There is no sense in the idea of a lion projecting the ground of its intelligibility in talking. That is, the lion does not inhabit the kind of space of possibility that our human form of life with language opens and that both allows for and requires projecting grounds of intelligibility. There are not debates among lions about whether something is suitable for food, a suitable mate, habitat, and the like. This is not because they lack the lin- guistic capacity to carry on such debates, but because the significance of features of the landscape is not open for lions in the way that it is for humans. For the lion, what is significant in any particular circumstance, and the way in which it is significant, is given with the circumstance itself and determined by the lion's instinctual nature. Using an expression of Heidegger's, we might say that the lion is "poor in world."29 If, then, we imagine that a lion utters some words, we must imagine that the words that the lion utters simply emerge from the lion, or are instinctually driven from the lion, in the way that a roar would be. The lion cannot but utter just the words that it does when it does. But for just these reasons, there is no sense in the idea that the lion is revealing himself, his position, his judgment of what in the circumstances is specifically salient or worthy of note. And there is also no sense in the idea of the lion revealing his desire for recognition of the specific position that he has taken or to know the position of the other to whom he speaks. Indeed, it is not clear that we can make sense of the idea of the lion speaking to another at all, where speaking to another would involve addressing words specifically to that (actual or imagined) other and so allowing the other to inform the specific words chosen, when they are said, the tone of voice in which they are said, and the like. This is perhaps why, although the concept of talking makes it natural to try to imagine the lion talking to another, Wittgenstein does not say that the lion talks to another, but only that it talks. The considerations that I have sketched are meant to suggest that a lion that talks, that utters words, cannot be understood as projecting the ground of his intelligibility in uttering the words that he does when he does and so cannot be understood as speaking at all. But if the lion cannot be understood as projecting the ground of his intelligibility in talking, then, again, however clearly we may understand the dictionary meanings of the individual words 276</page><page sequence="23">that he utters, we will not be able to understand what he is saying with those words. We will not be able to understand him. And if we cannot understand him and what he is saying with the words that he utters, then the words themselves will express no determinate meaning. They will not themselves serve to say one thing rather than another. V. CONCLUSION: LIBERATING LANGUAGE At this point I believe that we may begin to appreciate what, for Wittgenstein, is ultimately involved in our drive to produce for ourselves a picture of lan- guage as operating through pictures which carry determinate meaning entirely within themselves, as well as something of the morally redemptive character of his efforts to counter this view. At §117, and so in close connection with his discussion in §§113-15 of our self-captivating and self-bewitching efforts to produce this picture of language, Wittgenstein remarks: "You say to me: 'You understand this expression, don't you? Well then - I am using it in the sense you are famil- iar with.' - As if the sense were an atmosphere accompanying the word, which it carried with it into every kind of application." The idea that sense is an atmosphere that accompanies a word, as well as the closely related idea that language operates through pictures which carry their own mean- ing, are not, for Wittgenstein, simply philosophical mistakes. They are fan- tasies which express our desire. In particular, Wittgenstein's treatments of these ideas reveals them to be specific manifestations of a desire to escape, or to repudiate, the human conditions on meaning and intelligibility in lan- guage that I have been sketching. We might understand the desire to escape these conditions as a wish for meaning and intelligibility freed from depen- dence upon our agreement in judgment, and made secure from the vicissi- tudes of our ability to find, and of our desire to find, our feet with one another. We might also understand our desire to escape these conditions as a wish for meaning and intelligibility apart from the revelation of ourselves and our individual positions in speaking upon which intelligibility depends, and as a wish for understanding others apart from the work of understand- ing them , apart from the work of discovering and appreciating their posi- tions, circumstances, and purposes. Wittgenstein, I believe, wants us to recognize that each of these accounts of our desire is correct. Each captures something of what we want, and something of what we want to evade, in our drive toward a fantasy of lan- guage as operating according to our conception of pictures. However, I believe that at this point we can also see that, for Wittgenstein, our drive to repudiate the human conditions on meaning and intelligibility in language is nothing less than a drive to repudiate or to escape our conditioned human 277</page><page sequence="24">nature. It is a drive to repudiate or to escape the fact that not everything and anything can meaningfully be said at any time and to anybody; that speak- ing meaningfully depends upon taking up and revealing a comprehensible position in speaking; that what may be a comprehensible position will depend upon the circumstances in which one is speaking, upon those with whom one is speaking, and upon possessing with others a shared sense of possibilities and of significance; that what strikes us as significant, or can comprehensibly be shown to be significant, depends upon facts about our world, facts about our specific bodily nature, and facts about the nature and texture of our lives together; and much more.30 In the passages that I have been discussing, Wittgenstein is concerned to show specifically that and how, in our drive to repudiate our conditioned human nature through producing a picture of language as operating accord- ing to our conception of pictures, we bewitch our own intelligence. We become lost to ourselves in confusion, emptiness, and unintelligibility. First, we captivate ourselves through our repetitive efforts to produce this picture of language and to fix it before ourselves. Through our incessant repetition of this picture to ourselves, through our making ourselves captive to the construction of this picture, we come to feel as though the picture holds us captive, as though we cannot get outside of it. We project the picture into language, and then language seems to repeat it to us inexorably. Second, the picture that we work to give ourselves, a picture intended to secure meaning and intelligibility in language beyond or apart from our human conditions of meaning and intelligibility, precisely undermines the possibility of mean- ing and intelligibility. For in severing the connection between our words and our individual purposes in using those words in particular circumstances, it leaves our words, in a specific sense, empty. They are not devoid of dictio- nary meaning, but they are powerless to say anything. I began this essay with Wittgenstein's remark that "philosophy is a bat- tle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language" (§109). I have been arguing throughout that ordinary language is not the source of our bewitchment. Rather, I have argued, we bewitch ourselves and become lost to ourselves in confusion, emptiness, and unintelligibility through our drive to repudiate our conditioned human nature by seeking to escape the human conditions on meaning and intelligibility in language. Accordingly, our liberation from this bewitchment, our restoration to our- selves and to our intelligibility, will depend upon our returning to the rough, laborious, and sometimes shaky ground of human language and its condi- tions. But can philosophy, through language, lead us toward this return? Let me put the question this way. At §107 Wittgenstein has this: "We have got onto slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk, then we need friction. Back to the rough ground!"31 There 278</page><page sequence="25">is a slightly concealed conditional in the penultimate sentence of this remark. Making it explicit, the sentence reads: "If we want to walk, then we need friction." I take this passage to suggest that, in a condition which seems ideal, we will only recognize our need for friction, if we want to, or come to want to, walk. Similarly, we will only recognize our need for the rough ground of human language and its conditions if we desire, or come to desire, humanity, meaning, and intelligibility. But can philosophy, through language, activate in us this redemptive desire? Can Wittgenstein's language activate this desire? Perhaps it can, at least in part, by showing us that we do not now, at least not steadily, desire humanity, meaning, and intelligibility, by showing us that and how we are driven to deny them and so to deprive ourselves of them. But how exactly will showing us these things help? How will the language of Wittgenstein's text effect a transformation in us toward the acceptance of our human conditions, even if a transformation that lasts only as long as each moment of productive engagement with the text itself? Is the often remarked, and often dismissed, character of the writing and composition in Philosophical Investigations simply a matter of style?

This impression of at least part of the ambition of Wittgenstein's writing is, no doubt, also importantly encouraged by his descriptions of the aims of his work in ethical and religious terms, by accounts of his personal character, and by his deep admiration for the likes of Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Emerson, and Tolstoy. In this connection, see Brian McGuinness, Wittgenstein : A Life: The Young Ludwig 1889-1921 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988); Ray Monk, Ludwig Wittgenstein: The Duty of Genius (New York: Free Press, 1990); and Recollections of Wittgenstein, ed. Rush Rhees (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984). 3. Some of the recent work of Hilary Putnam and of Arnold Davidson might be taken as representative of the first course, and much of the work of Rush Rhees, D. Z. Phillips, Cora Diamond, and Sabina Lovibond might be taken as representative of the second. 4. In undertaking this project I am indebted to the three teachers with whom I have most systematically studied the later work of Wittgenstein: Stanley Cavell, Warren Goldfarb, 279</page><page sequence="26">and Hilary Putnam. From both Cavell and Putnam I have taken my conviction in the importance and viability of the project, and Cavell's The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979) represents for me the best exemplification of such an approach to Wittgenstein. From Goldfarb I have taken my appreciation of the fact that in order to make such a project compelling, it must not be allowed to rest upon scattered remarks but must be shown to emerge from the details of Wittgenstein's engagements with specific philosophical issues. 5. For a representative expression of this view, see G. P. Baker and P. M. S. Hacker, Wittgenstein: Meaning and Understanding (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1985), esp. 270-90. Wittgenstein's German, "Die Philosophie is ein Kampf gegen die Verhexung unsres Verstandes durch die Mittel unserer Sprache," perhaps more readily suggests this first reading. However, the extent to which this fact is telling is mitigated by at least two considerations. First, Wittgenstein's Austrian-German was always some- what oddly situated with respect to strictly proper German; second, by the time he was composing the Investigations, he had been in England long enough that even his Austrian-German was replete with Anglicisms and English structures. 6. This second reading is suggested by Stanley Cavell in his essay "Declining Decline: Wittgenstein as a Philosopher of Culture," in This New Yet Unapproachable America: Lectures after Emerson after Wittgenstein (Albuquerque, N.M.: Living Batch Press, 1989), 54. 7.

The quoted remark from Frege occurs in the Preface to his Begriffsschrift. The passage in full provides one very clear and powerful statement of this view of ordinary language and of how philosophy may be understood as a battle against the confusions created by ordinary language. He remarks: If it is one of the tasks of philosophy to break the domination of the word over the human spirit by laying bare the misconceptions that through the use of language often almost unavoidably arise concerning the relations between concepts and by freeing thought from that which only the means of expression of ordinary language, constituted as they are, saddle it, then my ideography, further developed for these purposes, can become a tool for the philosopher. To be sure, it too will fail to reproduce ideas in a pure form, and this is probably inevitable when ideas are represented by con- crete means; but, on the one hand, we can restrict the discrepancies to those that are unavoidable and harmless, and, on the other, the fact that they are of a completely different kind from those peculiar to ordinary language already affords protection against the specific influence that a particular means of expression might exercise. This passage is quoted from its reprinting in From Frege to Godei: A Sourcebook in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931, ed. Jean van Heijenoort (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1967), 7. 8. Here, too, the previously cited work of Baker and Hacker is representative. Much of the work of Cora Diamond dealing with the later Wittgenstein seems to me also to exem- plify, in an extremely productive manner, this general direction in understanding his work. Inviting and useful places from which to begin exploring her work include the two Introductions and the essay "Realism and the Realistic Spirit," in The Realistic Spirit: Wittgenstein, Philosophy, and the Mind (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991). 9. In speaking of a fundamental human drive to bewitch our own intelligence and insisting upon Wittgenstein's use of the term "drive [ Trieb ]" in place of Anscombe's "urge," I do not mean to suggest a biological function or to suggest that for Wittgenstein this drive is a primitive metaphysical feature of human beings. While the Investigations is, I think, concerned in part with a kind of philosophical anthropology, with charting the shape of our human nature, Wittgenstein is sufficiently sensitive to both the stability and the muta- bility of human nature to be justly suspicious of any claim to have discovered a meta- 280</page><page sequence="27">physical feature of all human beings at all times. My claim is rather that for Wittgenstein this drive characterizes "us" and "our" human nature. This is not a dogmatic claim for which we must simply take Wittgenstein's word. Rather, it is intrinsic to the nature of Wittgenstein's method in the Investigations that the reader discovers himself or herself to be possessed of this drive by discovering himself or herself to participate in the insis- tent emptiness and confusion of the interlocutory voices. Further, the scope of the "us," of those for whom Wittgenstein is able to speak, is not determined in advance but, as Stanley Cavell has argued in The Claim of Reason (17-28), is constituted as those who come to find themselves represented in or discovered by the text. I am grateful to Hubert Dreyfus for urging me to offer at least these brief remarks about a matter which clearly calls for more extended consideration. Even with these clarifications in place, however, it remains a real and important ques- tion how, for Wittgenstein, the idea of such a fundamental human drive to misunderstand or to bewitch our own intelligence is to be understood. It remains a real and important question how Wittgenstein understands the notion of a drive. Exploration of this ques- tion is beyond the scope of the present essay. Here I will only suggest that the nature of this idea in Wittgenstein's work is at least as complicated as the nature of drives, as opposed to instincts, in Freud's work, and that I believe it shares many important features with Freud's elaboration of the idea of drives. In particular, I suggest (1) that in Wittgenstein as in Freud the emergence of drives and the operation of drives are bound together with fantasies, indeed, that the emergence and specific shape of drives are importantly derivative of fantasies, and (2) that in Wittgenstein the emergence and oper- ation of a fundamental human drive to misunderstand or to bewitch our own intelligence is specifically bound together with and derivative of fantasies about the nature of lan- guage, some of which I discuss below. An initial set of passages through which one might begin to explore concretely what Wittgenstein means in speaking of a drive to mis- understand and the nature of this drive include §§39, 47, 59, 67, 87, 216, 279, 296-98. For a useful summary of Freud's theorization of drives, see the essays "Instinct (or Drive)" and "Psychical Representative," in J. Laplanche and J. B. Pontalis, The Language of Psychoanalysis, trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith (New York: W. W. Norton, 1973). 10. The thoughts in the previous two sentences are directly indebted to Warren Goldfarb's important essay "I Want You To Bring Me A Slab," Synthese 56 (1983): 265-82. In this essay Goldfarb powerfully argues that throughout the Investigations, Wittgenstein is not concerned to directly contest fully articulated philosophical problems and theories but rather to reveal the apparent naturalness of the first moves of thought which lead to the development of more fully articulated philosophical problems and theories, and to con- test these first moves. 11. I take this claim about the title of Kant's essay from Hannah Arendt, Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982). 12. I am indebted throughout this section to Timothy Gould's unpublished essay "Treating Pictures." My reading of §§113-15 is systematically informed by Gould's discussion of these passages, although I move on from them in a different direction from that taken by Gould. 13.1 have modified the Anscombe translation. Wittgenstein writes: "In diesen Worten erhal- ten wir, so scheint us mir, ein bestimmtes Bild von dem Wesen der menschlichen Sprache," which Anscombe renders: "These words, it seems to me, give us a particular picture of the essence of human language." However, this rendering may suggest that the picture is simply in the words and so is given to us along with the words. Her rendering, that is, shifts the source of the picture from us to the words themselves. The significance of such a shift emerges below. 14. Both Stanley Cavell and Warren Goldfarb emphasize that the passage from Augustine with which Wittgenstein begins the Investigations may be taken either as expressing sketchy but unproblematic commonplaces about the acquisition of language or as expressing the beginnings of a contentious philosophical theory about the essence of lan- guage. See Stanley Cavell's "Notes and Afterthoughts on the Opening of Philosophical 281</page><page sequence="28">Investigations in his Philosophical Passages: Wittgenstein, Emerson, Austin, Derrida (Cambridge, Mass.: Blackwell, 1995), and Warren Goldfarb, "I Want You To Bring Me A Slab." Indeed, for Goldfarb, this fact is central to his more general account of how Investigations works to thwart the emergence of philosophical questions about the nature of language, understanding, rule following, and the like. 15. In the remark from §193 I use "picture" in place of Anscombe's "drawing." In all instances Wittgenstein used the same word, Bild. 16. Here I am in some disagreement with several claims advanced by Richard Eldridge in his very useful recent book Leading a Human Life: Wittgenstein, Intentionality, and Romanticism (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997), 174 ff. In discussing §115 Eldridge suggests (1) that "the persona in the text and the historical writer here come close to being merged under direct characterizations of the persona-writer's activities of thinking"; (2) that the claim that "a picture held us captive" is, or is presented as, a "mag- isterial pronouncement" which is perhaps even paradigmatic of the sorts of "magisterial pronouncements" which Wittgenstein offers, according to Eldridge, in §§66-142; and (3) that the claim that "a picture held us captive" is offered from a perspective "beyond" a wish that has "held us in thrall." In line with the systematic and shaping effort of Eldridge's book to show that and how each stage of apparent rest in the Investigations is ultimately unstable, he argues that the apparent rest offered in §115 also cannot be accepted as final. My differences from Eldridge, accordingly, center on how we under- stand §115 itself to be presented within what might be called its dialectical setting. 17. As my mention of Freud indicates, I see an opening here, as well as in connection with the idea of a drive mentioned earlier, to considering the complex and specific connec- tions between various ideas in the works of Wittgenstein and of Freud. Here, there is a specific opening to considering the relation between Wittgenstein's understanding of rep- etition and ideas developed in Freud's relatively early essay "Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through," and in his relatively late text Beyond the Pleasure Principle, in The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud (London: Hogarth Press, 1958), vols. 12 and 18 respectively. Restricting myself here simply to "Remembering, Repeating and Working-Through," one might consider relations between Wittgenstein's ideas and Freud's arguments that (1) repetition is specifically repetition of forms of trauma, (2) that it is a form of remembering and reliving the trauma which is unrecognized by the subject and which both shows the trauma to remain in effect and preserves it, (3) that repetition serves to block self-conscious remembering of the trauma and the project of working-through the trauma, (4) that the urgency of repetition increases according to the strength of the resistance to self-conscious remembering and working-through, and (5) that release from the cycle of repetition is achieved only through remembering and working-through. Clearly, I cannot pursue this opening in the present essay. I am grateful to Joseph Schear for encouraging me to so much as sketch some of its shape. 18. I have noted my indebtedness throughout this section to Timothy Gould's unpublished essay "Treating Pictures." Here, however, in suggesting the phantasm of language as a kind of mechanism that mechanistically repeats a picture to us, I am differing with Gould's suggestion that §115 contains a phantasm of an "anthropomorphic language," of language itself as a subject which speaks to us. Important as they are, I cannot here explore the differences between, or the implications of the differences between, a phan- tasm of language as a mechanism and the phantasm of language as itself a speaking sub- ject. Here I will only note that my emphasis on the idea of language as a speaking mechanism is connected with what I consider a movement throughout the passages under consideration toward a mechanistic conception of speech and meaning generally. Aspects of what I have in mind in this idea emerge throughout the remainder of this essay. 19. See Gottlob Frege, "Thoughts," in Collected Papers on Mathematics, Logic, and Philosophy, ed. Brian McGuinness (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1984), esp. 355 ff. 20. Of course, Wittgenstein also challenges the idea that unless a thought with determinate sense can be specified apart from assertion, we cannot make sense of the idea that one and the same thought is asserted, denied, questioned, and the like. I do not concern myself with this matter further in this essay. 282</page><page sequence="29">21. Clearly I am not here denying, and do not take Wittgenstein to be denying, the possibil- ity of a thought which is ambiguous, polysémie, and the like. An ambiguous thought is not an indeterminate thought; it is a thought which may express more than one determi- nate sense. 22. In encapsulating these various issues with the notion of speaking language, I am informed by and indebted to the work of Rush Rhees. It seems to me that Rhees has done more than anyone else to bring out the centrality to Wittgenstein's later thought of the concept of speaking and of the question of what it is to speak. While this is a guiding preoccupation of much of Rhees's writing on the later Wittgenstein, it is especially cen- tral in his "Wittgenstein's Builders" and "'The Philosophy of Wittgenstein," both of which are reprinted in his Discussions of Wittgenstein (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1970), and throughout his posthumously published Wittgenstein and the Possibility of Discourse, ed. D. Z. Phillips (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998). 23. Both counting and recounting will themselves have further dimensions than these basic features which I specify here. See Cavell, The Claim of Reason, 94-95. 24. In "Wittgenstein's Builders," Rush Rhees remarks: If someone learns to speak, he does not just learn to make sentences and utter them. Nor can he merely have learned to react to orders. If that were all he ever did, I should not imagine that he could speak, and I should never ask him anything. When he learns to speak, he learns to tell you something; and he tries to. In learning to speak he learns what can be said; he learns, however fum- blingly, what it makes sense to say. He comes to have some sense of how different remarks have something to do with one another. That is why he can answer you and ask you things, and why he begins to follow a con- versation or to carry on a conversation himself. Or rather, it is misleading to say this is why he does that, as though what we had were a condition and what results from it. For in beginning to carry on a conversation, in trying to tell you something and trying to understand your answer, he is getting a sense of how different remarks have bearing on one another. And because he learns this, he can go on speaking or go on learning. If he can speak with me or ask me something here, then he will be able to ask me something else later." (79-80) I take it that some sense that telling is basic to the activity of speaking lies behind these remarks and motivates Rhees's claim that "when he learns to speak, he learns to tell you something; and tries to." It seems to me that a similar sense of telling as basic to many acts of speech is behind Cavell's remark in The Claim of Reason that "what I call something, what I count as something, is a function of how I recount it, tell it. And telling is counting" (94). Instead, following this remark, Cavell says: "If to what we call something and to what we count as something, we add the notion of what we claim something to be, we have gathered together the major modes in which we have invoked the fact of talking, the work of wording the world. . . ." These remarks are continued by a two-page elaboration of the weave of relations among major modes of speech. The elaboration centers on counting or telling and culminates in this thought: "what can comprehensibly be said is what is found to be worth saying," or, as he also puts it, "valuing underwrites asserting," or "interest informs telling or talking generally" (94-95). My remarks about telling are per- vasively informed by these ideas of Cavell's. 25. In general, telling depends equally upon difference and similarity of positions. There are, however, cases of competent telling in which these conditions do not obtain, and in par- ticular in which what I have called the condition of difference in the positions of the par- ties does not obtain. I may, for example, tell you something that I know that you already know. In this case, however, I may be telling you that I know, too. There are also cases of at least apparent telling in which one party tells another something that both parties know that each party already knows. Telling someone that you love him or her might be 283</page><page sequence="30">one such kind of case. However, one might say that telling here is attesting or declaring or expressing. In another class of cases in which one party tells something that is known, or imagined to be known, to both, telling brings the knowledge into the open so that it may be shared together - commiserating, reliving an experience (i.e., telling a story or recounting a familiar episode that might indeed have been told many times), and the like. 26. Indeed, we might even say that in telling I reveal my desire for your recognition of me as a being open to possibilities and thus able to single out specific possibilities as signif- icant, to recognize that others might find other possibilities significant, or might differ over the specific significance of a particular possibility and the like. In emphasizing that the desire for recognition is fundamentally in play in telling (and therefore in many acts of speech), I am clearly invoking Hegel's discussion of the formative struggle for recog- nition in The Phenomenology of Spirit, especially as that moment of the Phenomenology is taken up and inflected in Alexandre Kojève's Introduction to the Reading of Hegel I am indebted to William Bracken for helping me to recognize the fact of, and importance of, this dimension of telling, as well as to his interpretation of the desire for recognition in Kojève and Lacan developed in his "Becoming Subjects: The Agency of Desire in Jacques Lacan's Return to Freud," (Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1998). 27. I have argued that intelligible speech quite generally depends on projecting the ground of one's intelligibility, and have attempted to develop this idea more fully in opposition to a certain, familiar, form of the idea that context determines the intelligibility of what is said, in my essay "The Ground of Mutuality: Criteria, Judgment, and Intelligibility in Stephen Mulhall and Stanley Cavell," European Journal of Philosophy 6 (1) (1998): 1-31. My idea of speaking as defining or projecting the ground of intelligibility is influ- enced by and developed from some remarks in Stanley Cavell's "The Division of Talent," Critical Inquiry 11 (4) (1985): 519-38. 28. These brief remarks are informed by and to some extent echo a set of frequently cited remarks from Stanley Cavell's early essay "The Availability of Wittgenstein's Later Philosophy," in Must We Mean What We Say? (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), 52. He remarks: We learn and teach words in certain contexts, and then we are expected, and expect others, to be able to project them into further contexts. Nothing insures that this projection will take place (in particular, not the grasping of universais nor the grasping of books of rules), just as nothing insures that we will make, and understand, the same projections. That on the whole we do is a matter of our sharing routes of interest and feeling, modes of response, senses of humor and of significance and of fulfill- ment, of what is outrageous, of what is similar to what else, what a rebuke, what forgiveness, of when an utterance is an assertion, when an appeal, when an explanation - all the whirl of organism Wittgenstein calls "form of life." Human speech and activity, sanity and community, rest upon nothing more, but nothing less, than this. It is a vision as simple as it is difficult, and as difficult as it is (and because it is) terrifying. 29. Heidegger develops this idea in Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics, trans. William McNeill and Nicholas Walker (Bloomington: University of Indiana Press, 1995). 30. This drive to repudiate our conditioned human nature may be inflected either up or down. It may be inflected toward a fantasy of ourselves as God and thus above our human con- ditions on meaning and intelligibility, or toward a fantasy of ourselves as animal or as machine and thus below our human conditions on meaning and intelligibility. In my "Spiritual Exercises/Philosophical Exercises in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investi- gations " (unpublished), I argue that in opening the Investigations with a quotation from Augustine's Confessions, Wittgenstein signals that his project is throughout aligned with Augustine's at both the level of general aims and of methods. In particular, I argue (1) that Wittgenstein is throughout discovering various forms of a human drive to conceive of the human as complete and self-sufficient, which is to say as God, (2) that the forms of this drive are expressed and revealed in fantasies of language (but not only of lan- 284</page><page sequence="31">guage), (3) that the effect of this drive is our becoming lost in emptiness and unintelligi- bility to ourselves, (4) that the work of overcoming this wish is necessarily continuous (which is to say that, unlike in Augustine, there is no single conversion), and (5) that it takes place through a specific kind of work of remembering which is, for Wittgenstein as well as Augustine, essentially connected to work of reorientation in language. 31.1 have modified Anscombe's translation of the penultimate sentence in order to make the conditional character of the first clause more explicit. The German runs: "Wir wollen gehen; dann brauchen wir die Riebung." In this modified translation I follow Cavell's suggestion in This New Yet Unapproachable America, 55-56. 285</page></plain_text>
