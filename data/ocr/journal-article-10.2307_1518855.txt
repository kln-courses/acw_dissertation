<plain_text><page sequence="1">COMPELLED BY HONOUR-A NEW INTERPRETATION OF ZECHARIAH II 12A (8A) by LENA-SOFIA TIEMEYER Portland, USA The Hebrew text of Zech. ii 12 (Eng. ii 8) is extremely difficult.' The syntactical structure of the verse is unclear and our understand- ing of its vocabulary is insufficient. The first half of the verse begins with the opening phrase C1R 7 : mlrZ 'T,, indicating a divine oracle, and is followed by a speech in lsg., directed to a 2pl. audience. This sentence has a dative, D'1r, ', with an attached attribute describing the dative as having taken booty from the audience. The second half of the verse, beginning with "', gives the explanation, or possibly the justification, in 3m.sg. for the first part. Two interdependent questions require answers: 1. The general outline of the verse in its larger context must be clarified: where does direct speech begin and where does it end? 2. The interpretation and translation of the expression(s) 'rfnt '7T11: 1nR D'1V7 L must be determined. Of special interest is the meaning and syntactical function of IrMn and the subject and object of the verb In this article, I shall investigate these issues in the light of both the ancient versions and traditional and modern exegesis and suggest a translation and an interpretation that are satisfactory from both a syn- tactical and an exegetical point of view. I shall argue that direct speech begins already after the opening formula 'i7 1R f: ':. Accordingly, 11": is the logical subject of the verb "'nT and God is its object. Furthermore, by understanding '71: as "honour", the verb "to send" in a figurative sense "to commission", and the following 5R as "against", I shall reach the interpretation that "honour" sent God against the I am indebted to Prof. H.G.H.

Lastly, I shall claim that the phrase 'ntw nlSt' 'T ': Dnn'il in 13b and the similar ']"t ' lnlD nflq 'F 'Z: nD''l in 15b interrupt the divine oracle. Therefore, rather than being part of the divine speech, I regard these two statements as insertions by the prophet him- self in order to confirm his prophetic authenticity. I. When does God begin to speak? The aim of this section is to determine when and where God speaks in lsg. in Zech. ii 12. First, we shall investigate if there are any clues in the larger context of Zech. ii 10-17. Secondly, we shall discuss the most likely division of verse 12 itself. A. The immediate context of verse 12 The oracle in Zech. ii 10-17 (Eng. ii 6-13) is structurally very com- plicated. Throughout the material, there are numerous switches between first and third person and it is not easy to distinguish between the divine and the prophetic voice. If we examine these verses, with the excep- tion of verse 12, as to who is speaking, the following picture emerges: Verse 10 is clearly spoken by God, as indicated both by the content of the verse (MD:n 'n O '?l r,rQ nFln'l 'm1: ':) and the formula 'T QR:. In contrast, verse 11 is more uncertain, but in view of the parallel content, we may assume that God remains the speaker. Moving to 13a, the speaker is likely to be God due to its content (9]: " '::' '" rrT'U "' n1). Contrary to this, 13b ('l Ml t nl3 'r ' rnDl'l) must, for the same reasons, be said by the prophet. In verse 14, the divine voice is heard again. The expression R3 'u7 ': etc., similar to the phrase 9]:72 ':f ": in 13a, can only be said by God. This is further confirmed by the clause 'T DR: at the end of the verse. Verse 15 is again more difficult. While God is referred to in 3rd person in 15aa ('Fr R), 15ab contains a reference to God in lsg. (L5).2 This verse ends 2 Cf. Mic. iii 5, even though there, it seems as if it is the prophet speaking (w. 7, 8ff.). This lsg. reading is supported by, among others, A. van Hoonacker, Les douze petits proph&amp;tes (Paris, 1908), p. 602; H.G. Reventlow, Die Propheten Haggai, Sachada und Maleachi (ATD; Gottingen, 1993), pp. 48, 50. Note, however, that a number of schol- ars, e.g. T. Chary, Aggee-Zacharie-Malachie (SB; Paris, 1969), p. 70, and S. Amsler, Aggie, Zacharie 1-8 (CAT; Neuchatel-Paris, 1981), p. 72, note 8, read 1* in accordance with the LXX acXtO. 353</page><page sequence="3">LENA-SOFIA TIEMEYER in a manner similar to verse 13, that is with a statement of confirmation of the prophet's calling (1''5 '57T t n 2 'M T '1 rTmTn1). Finally, verses 16-17 are clearly reported by the prophet. To conclude, we see that God is speaking in verse 10, likely in verse 1, again in 13a, 14 and 15ab. In view of this, it is reasonable to assume that the divine voice is heard also in verse 12, the focus of this inquiry. 1. The prophetic authentication One thing stands out immediately: the two expressions of verification of the prophetic message in 13b and 15bb interrupt the flow of the oracle. While the one in 15bb can possibly be seen as the end note of the preceding divine speech, the one in 13b appears in the middle of the oracle. We have a parallel construction in Zech. iv 9 where the phrase :'[ ftS n1' lf 'FT ' ' n'T'1 follows immediately after God speaking in first person. The similar expression '3nT rll^ '71 '1 : Dn-lT [3'5 in Zech. vi 15 is slightly different in that both the immediately preceding words refer to God in third rather than first person but it nevertheless follows closely after direct divine speech. The oracle in vi 9-15 begins with God speaking directly (w. 10-11) whereas the con- tinuation (w. 12-14/15a), while still being an integral part of the ora- cle, contains words that Zechariah is to tell later toJoshua. This implies that God can refer to Himself in third person when stating what the prophet is to report to a third party not yet present. In view of this, it is questionable whether the expressions in Zech. ii 13b and 15bb can be treated as indications when God or the prophet speaks. Instead, I suggest that they should be regarded more as a lit- erary device, added in certain places by the prophet, in order to authen- ticate the oracle in question. While their significance is not in question, it nevertheless follows that they do not contribute to the actual con- tent of the oracle and should hence be disregarded when discussing its interpretation.3 2. The numerous occurrences of the verb 1't7 Related to the preceding discussion is the recurring use of the verb 'FT-W throughout the oracle in Zech. ii 10-17. It is used not only in each of the two expressions in 13b and 15bb, discussed above, but also in 12a. At a first glance, it may seem natural that the subject and 3 Contra CJ.L. Kloos, "Zech. ii 12: really a crux interpretum?", VT 25 (1975), p. 735. 354</page><page sequence="4">ZECHARIAH I I 2A the object of this verb should remain constant in all three cases. That is, however, not an inevitable conclusion. Instead, at a closer look, there is very little similarity between the two cases in 13b and 15bb on the one hand and the one in 12a on the other. In 13b and 15bb, the verb ':n573 is the main idea of the clause. Its purpose is to verify the fact that Zechariah was sent by God to the Judahites and accord- ingly, the prophet's words are God's words. Furthermore, as seen above, the clause is not an integral part of a larger framework but a statement independent of its immediate context.4 Contrary to this, ':nt in 12a is part of a larger context containing several ideas of which the "sending" is but one. Furthermore, due to the following phrase pl-Dr'1l, the nations rather than the Judahites are the target of 'nti. In the light of this, it is in my view unlikely that our knowledge of the identity of the subject and the object of the verb 'nftI in its occur- rences in verses 13 and 15 has any relevance for our understanding of the same issues in verse 12. 3. Conclusion To sum up, the main body of the oracle (Zech. ii 10-15) is an expression of direct divine speech, interspersed with brief authenticat- ing statements in verses 13 and 15, uttered by the prophet. Given that verse 12 is surrounded by verses where God speaks in Isg., verse 12 is unlikely to be an exception. B. The outline of verse 12 There are three main options5 of understanding the structure of Zech. ii 12, the crucial question being when the actual divine oracle begins. 4 Cf. Chary, Aggee, p. 68, note 13, p. 70, note a; Amsler, Aggee, pp. 75-6; Reventlow, Haggai, pp. 48-9. 5 There are variations to these options due to suggested emendations. Many early scholars, e.g. J. Wellhausen, Die kleinen Propheten (Berlin, 1898), p. 180, and K. Marti, Das Dodekapropheton (KHAT XIII; Tiibingen, 1904), p. 406, but also some more recent ones, e.g. Reventlow, Haggai, p. 48, note 37, choose to disregard 'TlbD T1D 'inr com- pletely and to connect the preceding 1N3'R 'iT 'n2 -D 'D with the following 01,] L*. A slightly modified version is proposed by H.G. Mitchell, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi and Jonah (ICC; Edinburgh, 1912), p. 142, followed by, among others, L.G. Rignell, Die Nacht- gesichte des Sachaja (Lund, 1950), p. 88, who, whilst retaining the words l'tt 1Z3 'T1r as an integral part of the text, regards them as a subordinate clause. Given the ease and simplicity of the emended text, it is very difficult to explain how and why the phrase ':':T -113 'int should have been added. Hence, I shall not take this option into account in the future discussion. 355</page><page sequence="5">LENA-SOFIA TIEMEYER 1. One possibility is that divine speech commences first in verse 13: zrc nS L'5 n D'W13r 5n 't n n lJ rn mn----n1l n ' rt F: ' .12 :1:9 n : Y33 Q3 Y33izn $ 1rrn=Dab '* 1'm QIT= '1' n" M 3A n ':n ': .13 .^nrt m nl!; -n : rnsTi- 2. Alternatively, the verse may be divided after the ethnachta, thus con- sidering all of 12a as the introduction in 3sg and only 12b as the actual divine saying: V tD l M'M-r- 3 "':n5 -in: mntM 'n n m n: ": .12 13'Y nrm g33 Q3 Y33;7 $ :(^nnzn^) QDns 3. Thirdly, one can divide the verse directly after the opening formula Mnl1CT 'i Cm i: 'nD: :nlAC7 'ICn AnQ F .12 13'D nM:= DMn C=: 3 3:n =: QInr Q: Psn 137 L n int : M3 n 1. Whose eye is the text talking about? The crux for determining the structure of Zech. ii 12 is the word 13D, "his eye". Hence, we will begin by investigating the different inter- pretations of this word. In Rabbinical tradition, 1]'D is counted as one of the scribal emen- dations, with the assumed original reading 'Y, "My eye". According to this tradition, these emendations were made by scribes for theo- logical reasons, often in order to prevent anthropomorphism.6 If we accept this tradition and assume an original reading "'Y, then the divine speech must begin already in verse 12, either directly following Mnlr1 'Fi CrA FD '" (option 3 above) or after the ethnachta (option 2). Alternatively, if we adhere to the reading 'D' as attested in the MT, then the oracle can only begin in verse 13 while 12ab-b must be spo- ken by someone else (option 1). The majority of the textual traditions support the reading 13'D as attested in the MT: the LXX, TJ and S all attest a third person suffix. There is, however, also textual evidence in favour of an original reading 'YD. First, some manuscripts7 of the Vulgate read pupillam oculi mei. 6 See C. McCarthy, The Tiqqune Sopherim (OBO 36; Gottingen, 1981), especially pp. 61-70. Such changes were also attempted by the early Jewish scholars in order to avoid the idea of anthropomorphism, for example MT Deut. xxxii 10b where we find a sim- ilar expression 1'Y ll1t'l referring to God's eye where TO translates "pn'I1' nrl=" i.e. "as the apple of their eye". 7The textual tradition of the Vulgate shows diversity. Of the nine sources listed by R. Weber, Biblia Sacra, Juxta Vulgatam Versionem, 2 (Stuttgart, 1969), p. 1418, five Mss 356</page><page sequence="6">ZECHARIAH II I2A Secondly, it is likely that the Qumran fragment 4QXII reads 'rD.8 Even so, due to the orthographic similarity between a yod and a waw, care should be taken not to base any conclusion on such faint evidence. In addition to these manuscripts, there is also circumstantial sup- port for the reading :'D. According to McCarthy, the fact that the tradition of a first person possessive pronoun is present in both Jewish (scribal emendations) and Christian (Vulgate) texts supports its origi- nality. Furthermore, if the fragment from Qumran indeed reads '"D, this would show that such a reading was in existence already during the second temple period. Concerning the fact that the reading of the LXX (roi 6o&amp;(p0aXio az&amp;xo) supports the MT, McCarthy argues that since all the preserved Mss of the LXX postdate the material from Qumran, their textual tradition may be the result of an attempt to bring the LXX in line with the, by then normative, text of the MT.9 To sum up, in view of the textual evidence, it is clear that there existed an alternative reading tradition of Zech. ii 12. Even though there is more textual support for the reading 13D, there are sufficient reasons, both textual and more circumstantial ones, not to reject the tradition of the scribal emendations in Zech. ii 12 and hence the alter- native reading :'D. Given this, there is no inherent problem in argu- ing that 12b is part of the divine speech. Instead, it is supported by the fact, discussed above, that God is attested to speak in lsg. in the surrounding verses 10, 11, 13a, 14 and 15ab. 2. The understanding of ' A separate yet related issue is the understanding of the word '" in the beginning of 12b. The question is whether this word can help us determine where direct speech begins. In the LXX, the '" beginning 12b is translated as 8t6zt, a form of the Greek conjunction onzt which means either "because, since" or simply "that".'Â° Similarly, the Peshitta has the neutral -a 7no = "that which"," while TJ translates -1 '1" follow the MT and write occuli eius while three Mss and the Clementine edition attest occuli mei i.e. 'D).

Alternatively, '" can also introduce direct speech.'3 In those cases, it is not to be represented in the English language. This understand- ing of '" is advocated by those exegetes and translators who follow the reading 7'D. For example, there is no word corresponding to "' in the Vulgate: qui enim tetigerit vos, tangit pupillam oculi mei. Such an understanding of '" in 12b would mean that the divine oracle begins in 12b. In conclusion, there is textual support for both readings. In fact, it is comparatively clear that the translation of '" depends on the divi- sion of the verse rather than vice versa. In other words, those trans- lations (LXX, S and TJ) who support the MT 1'ID and thus indirect speech render '" as "because" or "that". In contrast, the Vulgate which testifies to a Hebrew Vorlage '7'D leaves ' untranslated, commencing direct speech. Hence, it is doubtful that a convincing argument can be reached independently in favour of one of the two readings. 3. Which option is preferable? Having established that the reading '' has advantages over the alternative 1D, I shall now seek to determine which of the three divi- sions of the text listed above is the preferable one. a. The first option-direct speech begins in verse 13 In the first option, God speaks first in verse 13. As already seen, this reading is prevalent in much traditional material'4 but is also sup- ported by several modern scholars.'5 The main problem with this option, apart from the fact that it depends on the reading 1'D, is that the gap between the phrase Mnl1C, ' IC 1n F1 and the actual com- mencing of direct speech is unusually wide. Normally, this phrase is immediately followed by the actual oracle (e.g. Zech. i 3, 4, 17; viii 7, 9, 14 to name but a few). 12 The Aramaic word "'1 corresponds in most cases to BH 'D. See M. Jastrow, A Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature (London, 1903), p. 118. 13 BDB, p. 471b. lb. 14 The LXX, TJ and S, see above. 15 E.g. C.F. Keil, Die zwoifkleinen Propheten (BKAT; Leipzig, 1888), pp. 549-50; C. von Oreli, Die zwoifkleinen Propheten (KKANT; Munchen, 1908), p. 186; van Hoonacker, Petits prophetes, pp. 602-3; Kloos, "Zech. ii 12", p. 734. 358</page><page sequence="8">ZECHARIAH II I2A It may be argued that in Is. xlix 5-8, despite the phrases 'i C '1r nirD in verse 5 and the similar 'T 1An ilD in verse 7, the actual oracle comes first in the following verses (w. 6, 8ff. respectively). There is, however, a distinct difference between this passage and that in Zech. ii 12. First, rather than appearing in the middle of divine speech as does Zech. ii 12, Is. xlix 5 is preceded by a longer narrative spoken by the prophet. Hence, the prophet is already the expected speaker. This link is further supported by the recurrence of the theme of the prophet being called already in the womb (w. 1 and 5). Secondly, from a syntactical point of view, after introducing God as the speaker, both verses 5 and 7 continue with participles ('1', ~3) that function as divine epithets. In contrast to that, Zech. ii 12 continues with the finite expression 'nrS = 'llD inr. Lastly, the divine speech commences in Is. xlix 6, 8 with a new beginning (IAl'I, 'Tl '1n F), while Zech. ii 13, by repeating the particle 'D, stresses the continuity with the pre- ceding material. In view of these differences, Is. xlix 5-8 has little bear- ing on the syntactical interpretation of Zech. ii 12. b. The second option-direct speech commences after the ethnachta Most moder scholars choose the second option, reading a colon after the ethnachta.'6 According to this division of the text, the divine speech begins with 13' n=13 D3M 0=3 D33n ': with ': introducing direct speech (cf. above), while the phrase 0'lPDi r'1F,T D ', lnrl -T1:: 'nI znDr is uttered by Zechariah. In favour of this interpretation, the scribal emendation '7' can be maintained. However, similarly to the first option, the main weakness of this theory is that the formula Fi MnlAwM 'i nQ and the actual saying are unusually far apart. In view of this, the second option is a possible but not an ideal solution. c. The third option-direct speech begins directly after the formula nl:3C 'FT mn FTD $ Syntactically, this reading is the most straightforward one. In Biblical literature, the opening formula MnlAt 'i 'Rs iFTD ': is normally fol- lowed immediately by the oracle itself. The problem of this reading lies instead on a theological level. If we assume that the divine speech 16 E.g. K. Elliger, Die zwoklfkleinen Propheten II (ATD; Gottingen, 1959), pp. 117-8; F. Horst and Th.H.

It is disturbing that not only is God the passive object, but also that the identity of the active subject is unclear.17 For these reasons, few scholars advocate this division. Those among critical scholars who do, generally emend the text. Their emendations, though, are rarely convincing. For example, Ehrlich claims that the direct speech begins directly after MnAl1 'T MnQ FD 'I but in order to accommodate such a reading, he emends 'nrS? to 'lnnrPm merely because this would make more sense given his assumption that God is the speaker.'8 This, however, is a circular statement since it is in order to support his own claim that the divine speech commences directly following nl'mtn 'iT -Ir ifl ': that he is forced to emend the text. Those exegetes who, despite the theological difficulties, leave the text unaltered, mostly adhere to a Christological interpretation. For example, Augustine,19 followed by, amongst others, Calvin,20 sees this verse as a reference to Jesus being sent to earth. Without making a theological statement, this exegesis is the most feasible with regard to the syntax of the verse: according to the New Testament, Jesus, the second part of the Godhead and accordingly God, was indeed the pas- sive object and thus "sent" to (the Jews and) to the Gentiles by God the Father. Even so, it is wholly alien in its historical context and accordingly cannot be accepted. The question then is whether it is possible to adhere to this syn- tactical reading whilst remaining close to both the given text and to its present context. The solution to this reading lies in a correct under- standing of the subject of 'Irn5. This verb can have two possible sub- jects which are known to the reader. On the one hand, God may be the subject, thus referring back to nl't1 'iT. In this case, the verb 'rnT5 must be part of Zechariah's speech rather than the oracle itself. In support of this reading, the phrase 'nr5 Ml1 'nlt' 'i " in the following verse 13b and 15bb is sometimes quoted due to the occurrence of the same verb 'nrTW).21 As discussed earlier, however, it is unlikely that we can derive any hint at the interpretation of the actual oracle from this 17 J. Calvin, in his commentary to Zechariah ii 12 (8). 18 A.B. Ehrlich, Randglossen zur Hebrdischen Bibel (Leipzig, 1912), p. 331. 19 St. Augustine, The City of God, book 20, chapter 30. Nevertheless, he surprisingly adheres to the MT by translating ii 12b with occuli eius i.e. 12:' (cf. above). 20 J. Calvin, in his commentary to Zechariah ii 12 (8). 21 E.g. Meyers, Haggai, p. 165. 360</page><page sequence="10">ZECHARIAH II I2A phrase due to its independent and separate character. In other words, there is no reason to assume that the subject and the object of 'lrTD must be identical in all three cases. On the other hand, the word IID= may be the subject of 'Tnft. It is a noun in 3m.sg. and it stands in close proximity to the verb in question. In this respect, it is the natural subject from a purely gram- matical point of view. The word 'TD: is the attested subject in, among others, Is. iv 5 (flTn l D1: 1 pD ") "because over all, glory is a cover", and Ps. xlix 17-18 (11'D1: l"nrl ''1P' [...] ln' ' 711: T'7' ":) "when the wealth of his house grows [...] his wealth will not descend after him". Further, it can appear as the subject in construct with another noun, e.g. Is. lx 13 (l1' J'[5 ll' prt' TMZ) "and the glory of Lebanon shall come to you", and the similar Ez. xliii (An MLq'' 'rn5 'I=D fll) "and behold, the glory of the God of Israel is coming." Those scholars who regard the word 'lDD in Zech. ii 12 as the sub- ject, unfailingly see it as a divine epithet.22 Accordingly, 'nrTD must again be part of indirect speech rather than a first person oracle. The main flaw of this interpretation is that God is already introduced to us as nl'AZ 'Tl.23 My proposal is to regard T1D as an abstract qual- ity, referring to God's glory, but nevertheless not to be identified with God on a grammatical level. As such, it "sends" or rather "commis- sions"24 God CD'11T 51. Is such an interpretation possible? II. The meaning of C'"717 s 'Tn7 * 77=2 '7nT Before answering this question, we have to discuss the meaning of the whole expression CD"Lfl 5 'FnT50 1I= 'ntr. Many attempts have been made to interpret this difficult clause. Not only is the semantic value of the words under question, the syntactical relationship between them is also unclear. Since we have already discussed the different possibilities for interpreting the verb 'TnfT, this section deals primar- ily with the other two components, 'TZ i rnt and D'1XT pl. 22 E.g. Rignell, Nachtgesichte, p. 88; Meyers, Haggai, pp. 162, 164-5. The latter ren- ders Zech. ii 9b similarly, as "and as Glory will I be within her" (p. 149, see com- ment on p. 157). 23 Cf. W. Rudolph, Haggai-Sachara 1-8-Sachada 9-14--Maleachi (KAT; Giitersloh, 1976), p. 88, note 12. 24 The meaning of Fnr as "to commission" is commonly attested in the Hebrew Bible. For examples, see BDB, p. 1018b. 2a. 361</page><page sequence="11">LENA-SOFIA TIEMEYER A. The expression 0'72t;7 *t Beginning with the expression r1T'l L2, the question in this section concerns the understanding of the preposition ~L. Several interpreta- tions are attested in BH. Mostly, 'A is rendered as "to" in English, indicating direction, but also other meanings, such as "against", "by" and "nearby", are commonly attested. Below, I shall discuss these lat- ter translations. 1. tX = "against" In a number of cases, L7 can be comparable with DI and carries the meaning "against" or "concerning" (e.g. Gen. xx 2; Is. xxvii 33; Jer. xxii 18; xl 16; Ps. ii 7). In the present case, the question is whether Zech. ii 12 refers to someone being sent physically to the nations or more figuratively against them. On the one hand, while not exclud- ing the possibility that Zechariah travelled abroad, there is no prece- dence of similar prophetic journeys in the rest of the Bible. Hence, it is unlikely that the preposition 5t here indicates foreign travelling. On the other hand, the latter understanding of L5 to mean "against" is supported by at least one Ms25 attesting the reading 5D in Zech. ii 12, together with TJ (A'?YQP 5D 'n5t) and S (QMYP 5D 'n'lT). Following this reading, the 3m.sg. object of '1nrT would be sent "concerning/ against" the nations rather than "to" them. In my view, this transla- tion has several benefits. It does not only remove the necessity of Zechariah being commanded to travel abroad but also fits well with the negative message of Zech. ii 13.26 2. 5f = "among" Kloos's innovative reading of Zech. ii 12a is to a small extent depen- dent on her understanding of the preposition Ll. She accepts the word order of the MT but suggests that the expression C'11, 51 should be connected with 'ln= 'n rather than with the preceding 'n75t.

Accordingly, the verb 'n,ti should be interpreted separately from the phrase '137 TS -1rM nMI etc. Kloos then connects the preposition 5R with 'T:D and translates "his honour among the nations", basing her translation of 5R on BDB's statement that 'b can express "presence on a spot, against, at, by", as seen by Josh. v 3 (nl-nDT nUL3 ~P' '111 MA nl ,8).27 She con- cludes that the whole expression states that God sent Zechariah to pursue (God's) honour among the nations.28 Kloos's suggested translation, however, cannot be accepted. While 5b in Josh. v 3 may mean "by", i.e. "nearby", there are no attested occurrences where it can mean "among". Hence, she goes one step too far when connecting 5R there with the occurrence in Zech. ii 12. 3. Conclusion It seems likely that in the present context, 4t should be understood in the figurative sense as "concerning" or "against". B. The expression 77- 717nt Both words in the expression '71: CMr need to be discussed. Beginning with the word '71D, most scholars understand it as an expression of "glory" or "honour", but other meanings have also been suggested. In the case of 'In, there is no consensus concerning its interpretation. Three meanings are clearly attested in Biblical Hebrew, i.e. as an adverb, as a preposition, and as a conjunction.29 In addition, two other possible meanings have been proposed, that is that n1rT may denote "the purpose of obtaining", comparably with "after" in English and "nach" in German30 etc., or that it can mean "with", inspired by the Latin rendering cum in the Vulgate of 'nWT in Ps. lxxiii 24. 1. The understanding of 7=2. The majority of scholars render '7n: as "glory", the most com- monly attested meaning of the word. There are, however, other pos- sible translations, such as "splendor" (e.g. Ez. iii 23),31 "honour" (e.g. 27 BDB, 5L, p. 40b. 8 "against, at, by". 28 Kloos, "Zech. ii 12", pp. 735-36. 29 BDB, pp. 29-30. 30 E.g. the phrase "er strebte nach Ehre" = "he strove for glory". 31 Mitchell, Haggai, p. 141. 363</page><page sequence="13">LENA-SOFIA TIEMEYER Nu. xxiv 11; Prov. xv 33) or "treasures" (e.g. Gen. xxxi 1; Is. x 3; lxi 6).32 In the case of Zech. ii 12, both BDB33 and the new Dictionary of Classical Hebrew34 render II= as "honour". In my opinion, this understanding fits the present context best. In view of my suggestion above to understand r1=Z as the subject of 'Yn:T, I suggest that the idea that "honour" commissioned God against the nations (D'13l 5R) concerns the issue of God's reputation being at stake after the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BC. The book of Ezekiel (e.g. Ez. xx 8-9; xxxvi 21- 23) contains the related theme that God saved His people from extinc- tion in order to uphold His reputation as a powerful God among the nations. The same idea is alluded to in Is. xlviii 9-11 (~Inl ''71=1 IrIn S) and it may also be present in Zechariah's first vision (i 7-17). Other scholars revocalize M'M: to any form of '7: = "heavy". For example, Van Hoonacker repoints 'M:i to kobed = "load, burden" (charge) or "moral misfortune" (malheur) and translates "Apres le temps de] souffrance, il m'a envoye vers les nations".35 Others, for example Chary,36 suggest the translation "Avec insistance il m'a envoye", i.e. "with insistence", understanding 'nFt as "with" (see further below). Both these suggestions are interesting but they fail to convince since there are no attested examples where M'M: indicates either "tribula- tion" or "with insistence". To sum up, it seems preferable to retain the Masoretic reading kabod. In the case of its translation, the understanding of '71n as "hon- our" fits well in the present context and is additionally supported the- matically by especially the book of Ezekiel. 2. The understanding of '7n17 The difficulty finding a satisfactory interpretation of nIl in the pre- sent context has given rise to a number of emendations of more or less drastic nature.37 Common to all of them, however, is the lack of textual support. In view of this, I will only focus on those suggestions which deal with the text of the MT. 32 Ehrlich, Randglossen, p. 331. 33 BDB, p. 459a.3. 34 DCH, 1, p. 193. 35 Van Hoonacker, Petits Prophetes, pp. 602-3. 36 Chary, Aggie, p. 70.

She translates Zech. ii 12 as "He sent me in order to obtain glory among the nations". In support of this translation, she quotes several Biblical passages where 'nIr denotes the purpose or the goal of a mission, the most convincing ones being Job xxix 8 (1r'1l' pn' b: nrA); 1 Sam. viii 3; Ez. xxxiii 31 and Ps. xciv 15 (the last three indicating mental pursuit).39 A more daring suggestion is made by Eerdmans. In his commen- tary to Ps. lxxiii 24, the only other place in the Bible where the expres- sion T'M: '~nt is attested (see further below), he translates the phrase 'nFpn T1:: 'nl1 as "you take me after glory" i.e. "you make me suc- ceed". By analogy, he renders '1=D '~nrl in Zech. ii 12 "to make a successful result".40 In view of this, there is some support for an understanding of nIrl as "in order to obtain". However, the quoted examples of 'nrl from BH are ambivalent in that they might support this use but can also be interpreted satisfactorily in other ways. To sum up, we cannot exclude the possibility to understand 'nr as "in order to obtain" but it must remain uncertain. b. nrA -a preposition meaning "with" As already mentioned, the expression r71= '7n is also attested in Ps. lxxiii 24 (':Tpn 1=: mnrlI :nrn n, r :). Due to the parallelism glory", a change which only involves switching the place of the two letters resh and het. He also suggests the reading 71=3 f~^ but that would involve a more drastic change of the consonantal text. The reading 1n3 nt~ is followed by, among others, Marti, Dodekapropheton, pp. 406-7, and P.R. Ackroyd, Exile and Restoration (OTL; London, 1968), p. 180, specially note 31. The latter suggests the following translation: "For thus says Yahweh of hosts: (It is he whose glory commissioned me or By a way of glory he com- missioned me to the nations which were plundering you). He who touches you touches the apple of my eye." Other, more drastic emendations, have been suggested by, for example, E. Sellin, Das Zwdofprophetenbuch (KAT; Leipzig, 1930), p. 489 (translation) and p. 491 (comment), followed by Elliger, Kleine Propheten, p. 117, who changes Uirl to '12? and adds a possessive pronoun to '13z. This would then form a relative clause, referring back to God, which could be translated as "whose glory" (dessen Herrlichkeit). 38 E.g. F. Hitzig, Die zwoifkleinen Propheten (Leipzig, 1881), p. 342; Keil, Kleine Propheten, p. 550; von Orelli, Kleine Propheten, p. 186; Ehrlich, Randglossen, p. 331. 39 Kloos, "Zech. ii 12", p. 729. 40 B.D.

Probably in view of this, the LXX (Ps. Ixxii 24) renders the Hebrew 'nD= with &amp;exra 56ST; and the V translates it as cum gloria. This understanding of n71=D HT as "with glory" has caused some scholars to suggest a sim- ilar meaning for the same expression in Zech. ii 12, i.e., "I have sent you with glory". In support for this interpretation, Scott lists, among others, Ex. xi 5 (cmnr'r1l -Tn -t l nnaRtf = "the maidservant who is with the mill"), Jer. xxv 26 ("the king of Sheshach shall drink with them"), Ruth i 15, 16 ("return with") and Ec. xii 2 (Cl:3l -m1 c'rD3l 11') = "before the clouds return with the rain"). He argues that the mental picture is that of men walking in a single file after someone. In this manner, those who walk after walk in fact with.41 In response to this, most of these examples are ambivalent. The picture in Ex. xi 5 is probably the maidservant working behind the mill stone. In the case of Ec. xii 2, given larger context of w. 1-8 which describes darkness and emptiness, the idea that the clouds return after the rain rather than disappearing fits well. Furthermore, as Kloos points out, one ought not to transfer the meaning "with" from cases where it can be deduced from "after, behind" to cases where it cannot.42 In conclusion, this interpretation of -lrl is not convincing. c. 1rla-indicating space The third alternative, interpreting -r1l as indicating space, is rarely suggested. To my knowledge, only Vriezen and Rudolph attempt this. Vriezen understands the words 'l3g -nI as a gloss which shows that verse 12 is to be read directly after nZD in verse 9 where it previ- ously occurs. He proceeds to reconstruct the whole passage, reading the sequence verses 9, 12, 10, 11, 13 etc. According to Vriezen, the subject of ']rf'I is God and the accusative object is the angel speak- ing in verse 8. Concerning the fact that it is God speaking in verse 9 and that the phrase MnAl=l '- IDQ Af '0 stands in the beginning of verse 12, Vriezen compares Zech. ii 12 with the 3sg. statement of God in Zech. i 16b (C&amp;LT1' 5L flt' imM l) and argues that the prophet is explaining the words of God in his own words. He assumes that the 41 R.B.Y. Scott, "Secondary Meanings of InT, after, behind", JTS 50 (1949), pp. 178-9. See also Chary, Aggee, p. 70; M.

This interpretation utilizes the fact that 1'D refers to God in 3sg., making even 12b part of the angel's words. In the following verses, the angel delivers his speech to the nations.43 Rudolph develops Vriezen's suggestion further, claiming that not only the words '1I InTM but also the following 'nfMb are part of the gloss. He argues that according to the glossator, the phrase DnlT'1 nMtS nlMA= '7n in 13b belongs after the word 11=*1 in 9b. In sup- port for this kind of gloss, he quotes, among other places, Zeph. iii 20 and Numb. xxxii 38.44 In response to Vriezen's suggestion, his attempt to explain the reason why the verses were mixed up in the first place needs more supporting evidence. Furthermore, despite admit- ting that the regular function of a gloss is to clarify something unclear, Vriezen here proposes a different kind of gloss which indicates a dis- order in a text, a kind not hitherto known to exist. Rudolph's attempt to find similar glosses elsewhere in the Bible also fails to convince. In the light of this, both Vriezen's and Rudolph's interpretations must remain conjectural. d. nT1- indicating time The word 'lrl here in Zech. ii 12 is most commonly understood in a temporal sense, as either a preposition or a conjunction. a. In early exegesis, the understanding of IMA as a preposition of time was prevalent. For example, Radak regards the happenings in Zech. ii 12 as a temporal process: after Glory, i.e. when God has become the glory in the midst (of His people), He will send the prophet to the nations.45 Similarly, many traditional Christian exegetes interpret 'Mlq as a temporal preposition but give the verse a Christological mean- ing: with the return from Babylon, the people had seen the beginning of God's glory. After glory, i.e. after this, God would send the full- ness of God's glory, i.e. the promise of the Messiah was to be fulfilled.46 Several modern scholars also argue in favour of a temporal mean- ing, although reaching different interpretations. For example, Mitchell, in view of the connotations of the expression '7 1='Z in Ez. iii 23 43 Th.C. Vriezen, "Two Old Cruces", OTS 5 (1948), pp. 88-91. 44 Rudolph, Haggai, p. 88, note 12. 45 'r'n z1zi n;Dn'2n n;' ' iln l:rt ::n z nQ n'c Drr' rn'nn ~F :pT'n 46 E.g.J.

Hence, God gives Zechariah the message he is to deliver "after splendour", i.e. after the series of visions.47 The main problem with this interpretation is the very fact that the oracle in Zech. ii 10-17 comes after the third vision rather than after all of them. Hence, to accommodate this interpreta- tion, we would have to assume that the present oracle is misplaced.48 pa. A different approach is taken by Rignell who understands -IT1 as a relative conjunction that introduces a subordinate clause and that should be translated as "who/which previously". In support of his claim, Rignell quotes Codex Leningradiensis of Gen. xxii 13. This man- uscript attests the reading rTMr -lrS 5'A lIMl in contrast to many other Mss, the Samarian Pentateuch, LXX, S and T which all support the (more commonly accepted) consonantal text 'nM 'Sl = "one ram". Rignell translates: "Als nun Abraham seine Augen aufhob, wurde er einen Widder gewahr, der vorher mit seinen Hornem im Gebusch hangengeblieben war".49 This example is comparably weak, especially given that the read- ing 'nTr is not supported by any of the versions. Furthermore, due to the orthographic similarity between the 1' and the '1, it is easy to see how a scribal mistake could have happened. Hence, the reading 'lrT is probably not the original one and thus lacks bearing for our under- standing of Zech. ii 12. Pb. Alternatively, '1Fr can be seen as a shorter form of conjunction 'tl rlm "after that". BDB finds this construction in Lev. xiv 43; Jer. xli 16 and Job xlii 750 with Petitjean adding Jer. xl la,51 and DCH adding Job xix 26.52 In Lev. xiv 43; Jer. xl la and Jer. xli 16, 1rA relates back to the preceding main clause. Such a rendering would suit a reading of Zech. ii 12 where MnlA=; 'il -IQ fD ' is the main clause, followed by the subordinate one introduced by 'lrl. This, how- ever, does not fit well with my suggestion that -rHT begins the direct 47 Mitchell, Haggai, p. 141. 48 Cf. Baldwin, Haggai, p. 109. 49 Rignell, Nfachtgesichte, p. 8. 50 BDB, p. 30a. 51 Petitjean, Oracles, pp. 116-7. He translates Zech. ii 12 accordingly: "Car ainsi a parl Jahv6 Seba6t, apres que la Gloire m'eut envoye". His understanding is followed by, among others, Meyers, Haggai, p. 164. 52 DCH, p. 193. 368</page><page sequence="18">ZECHARIAH II I2A speech. In that case, there would be no syntactical link between the new clause and the preceding one. Instead, the main clause would come first in 12b or even later in 13a. While it is possible for the sub- ordinate clause to precede the main one (e.g. Job xix 26), the prob- lem is that both 12b (... DX 'TZ) and 13a (... 'Â¶1 ' ~il ,Z) begin with ':. This means that rather than introducing a main clause, we would normally expect yet another subordinate one. Pc. I suggest that the solution to the problem is to read inrT as a short form of ~p "n-rT "afterwards". This use is attested in a number of places in the Bible, for example in Gen. xviii 5 (Irn DZ =15 nIO1 ml'ln = "sustain yourself; then, go"); xxiv 55 (1 D'' lnW -ln 1Z31n 'ln nA 'ltDY = "let the girl remain with us some 10 days; afterwards, you may go"); Numb. xxxi 2 ('In r''TCn nM 710'1 ~n. nnp3: mp: T'nD bA Olqn = "Avenge the Israelites on the Midianites; then you shall be gathered to your people"); Hos. iii 5 Wlqt' 'n lnD -MTh = "Afterwards, the Israelites will turn back"), and Prov. xxiv 27 ('nr 5 IUI M ' nDIm -[n,- nrl- = "and get ready what you have in the field; afterwards, build yourself a house"). Normally, 'lrT refers back to the first half of the saying, but as shown by Hos. iii 5, it is also possible for 'TT1 to begin a new sentence and to refer back to the content in the pre- ceding one. One seeming problem with this reading is that we would have expected an imperfect rather that the perfect 'n1r* describing God's coming retaliation. It is likely, however, that the author here used a perfectum propheticum, i.e., a perfect form that indicates that, from the point of view of the author, the future deed is already accomplished.53 The imminent fulfillment of the prophecy is supported by the use of participles in the rest of verse 12 and the following verse 13. A good example which illustrates this concept is Is. ix 1 (IR 'tpro D7'Zb Dll MD 51n '1rn) where a perfect, following a participle, indicates a future sense "the people who walk in darkness will see a great light". The text of Jer. v 6a shows light upon our verse as well (Dl p D r1:' mnf rin n Ar nub g rpr bD DTnp m nn MI- n13ns IRT -n Qrri): the perfect in the first part of the clause is contrasted by the follow- ing participles and imperfect forms, and the whole sentence should be translated as either present or future.54 53 GK Â§106n.

We find such a meaning in Gen. x 18 (Inrl '=Zsl MnMlnn rnrmsn ISM); Gen. xxxiii 7 (I1nnfr T 4nM1 go, tm nmRi) etc. Such an understanding of 71=D -nW in Zech. ii 12 fits well also in Ps. lxxiii 24 (see above). In fact, those exegetes and translators who do not follow the reading "with" as attested in the LXX and the V, normally render '1:3 'IrT in Ps. lxxiii 24 as a temporal adverb: "after- wards, you will take me to glory/honour".55 In view of this, I suggest the following structure of Zech. ii 12: "Thus says the Lord of Hosts: 'Afterwards, honour sent Me against the nations who are spoiling you, because whoever touches you touches the pupil of My eye."' From an exegetical perspective, God is seeking to prepare His peo- ple for the coming destruction of the nations and to ensure their safety: in verse 10, he is commanding the exile to flee Babylon (v. 10), so that afterwards, He is free to bring destruction of Babylon. III. A new reading of Zech. ii 12-15 It is difficult to reach a conclusion as to which of the many inter- pretations of Zech. ii 12 is the most plausible. Each reading has its advantages as well as its drawbacks. Beginning with the division of the text and the key word 1DI/'Tr , the evidence for an original reading 'TY is in my view the most convinc- ing. It is supported by the very variety of its sources, both Jewish and Christian and also by its probable attestation in the Qumran scrolls. In the case of the division of the verse, the most neutral position is that of syntax. Hence, I regard a decision based purely on syntac- tical grounds, without regard to content or theology, to be better founded than one which is influenced by the same elements. Having said that, an interpretation must naturally be restricted to what makes sense semantically. In view of this, the most natural understanding is that direct speech follows directly after the opening formula il~ Mnl1M ' 'In mn. It follows that God is the object of the following verb `lnt) and accordingly the one being sent. 55 See e.g. the RSV; A.A. Anderson, The Book of Psalms, Volume II. Psalms 73-150 (NCBC; Grand Rapids, 1972), pp. 535-6. Cf. A. Weiser, Die Psalmen (ATD; Gottingen, 1959), p. 344: "und nimmst mich hernach zur herrlichkeit" (The Psalms (OTL; London, 1962), p. 514). BDB, p. 459a. 3, translates 'T1Z in both Zech. ii 12 and Ps. Ixxiii 24 as "honour". 370</page><page sequence="20">ZECHARIAH II I2A This interpretation inevitably poses the question: who can send God? Looking at the form of the verb, we are looking for a m.sg. subject. This means that God, another male person, or the noun 'T7: can be the subject of '2:tD. Again, from a purely syntactical point of view, the last alternative is the most compelling: 'Dn: immediately precedes ':Mnt and is hence its natural subject. Concerning the words DnA '~DPwn '1137 A l :nb "T1: -mnr, the word '71: is in my view best translated as "honour", and I suggest reading 'TnM as "afterwards", referring back to the preceding verse. Furthermore, I do not consider it justified to detach 'nTtD TD: ' nThR from '1Tl PL. On the contrary, any attempt to separate between the two expressions creates an awkward syntax. Hence, God is sent 'W1l LA. Lastly, in the case of the word LA, a preposition which can mean both "to" and "against, concerning", I find that the present context sup- ports the latter interpretation due to the assumed Judahite audience of the oracle, together with the negative prediction for the nations. My proposition is to see the whole clause as a metaphorical expres- sion where God is sent by (His) honour to proclaim punishment for the nations. This reading fits well with the rest of Zech. i-viii, espe- cially with the oracle in Zech. i 7-17 where God is persuaded to show compassion to Jerusalem and to punish the nations who have sacked her. Having let His own people being deported and His temple destroyed, God's honour was at stake. He had to declare that rather than being a sign of His weakness, the destruction should be interpreted as the necessary punishment of His people. Now afterwards, when the peo- ple of Israel had served their time in exile, God's honour compelled him to declare to the nations, that is, to the ones who had carried out this punishment, that whoever touches His people touches God Himself. Their plundering of His people would not go unpunished. This reading is reminiscent of the message of Ezekiel, another priestly prophet, who often declared that God saved Israel, not due to any of her good deeds but rather due to His own name, i.e. His honour (e.g. Ez. xx 44). IV. Conclusion To conclude, I suggest the following translation of Zech. ii 11-15: "Up, oh Zion, flee, you who dwell in fair Babylon! Because thus says the Lord of Hosts: 'Afterwards, honour will send me against the nations who are spoiling you, because whoever touches you touches 371</page><page sequence="21">LENA-SOFIA TIEMEYER the pupil of my eye. Because behold, I am stretching out my arm against them and they will become spoil to their servants [-and you will know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me]. Shout for joy and rejoice, oh daughter of Zion, for behold I am coming and I shall dwell in your midst', says the Lord. 'And many nations will join the Lord on that day and they will become My people and I shall dwell in your midst.' [-and you will know that the Lord of Hosts has sent me to you]." Abstract This article proposes that direct speech begins immediately after the words "thus says the Lord" in Zech. ii 12. It follows that the word -TnD, understood as "honour", is the logical subject of the verb "he/it has sent me" while God is its natural object. The verb "to send" is further understood in a figurative sense "to commission", and the following preposition Lt is translated as "against". In this way, Zech. ii 12 is a metaphorical expression describing how God is sent by (His) honour to proclaim pun- ishment for the nations. Such a reading fits well with the rest of Zech. i-viii (e.g. Zech. i 7-17): having let His own people being deported and His temple destroyed, God's honour was at stake. A similar idea is found in Ezekiel (e.g. Ez. xx 44). 372</page></plain_text>
