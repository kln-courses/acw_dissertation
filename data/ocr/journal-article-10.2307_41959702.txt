<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Social" and "Political" Lee C. McDonald There is a strong antipolitical bias in many strains of liberal, liberal-conservative, anarchist, and Marxist thought that helps explain the present confusion as to the proper distinction between what is "social" and what is "political." Man and many other animals are social, i.e., dependent on the mutually cooperative group for sustaining life. But only man is political, i.e., capable of creating new worlds by collective choice. As citizens and as scholars, we need to move beyond preoccupation with the social to concern for the genuinely political, which parallels a shift from preoccupation with "behavior" to a concern for "human action." You drive into a service station and an attendant with the name "Manuel" on his shirt pocket approaches and you say: "Fill it up." He says "Yes, Sir," and fills it up, and while you are signing a credit card you ask, "With this fuel shortage is the government going to try gasoline rationing?" The attendant replies, "I hope not. That would be a stupid idea." You reply, "Well, maybe," and drive off. This very ordinary incident can illustrate many of the perplexities of distinguishing just what it is that social scientists study. The name embroidered on the shirt may be a clue to a different cultural heritage from that of the driver, a heritage that an anthropologist might study. The "Sir" in "Yes, Sir," a speech usage deliberately inculcated in training service employees, is a residue of medieval class distinctions cultivated supposedly because its implied flattery has economic advantages. But a sociologist of class, or of everyday life, or an ethnomethodologist or a psycholinguist or perhaps an ordinary language philosopher is more likely to study its character than an economist. The "fill it up?" the actual flow of gasoline, and the name on the credit card are clearly economic phenomena. But the brief mention of gasoline rationing, and especially the note of disagreement about it, are political, because they imply an argument over the best public policy. In this, as in a million incidents each day, we see reflected the culture, the society, the economy, and the polity. These are different but related entities and though the incident is simple, the relationships among these entities are immensely complex, far more complex than any phenomena examined by natural scientists. The scholarly problem of what we as social scientists can and ought to study and how or whether we draw boundary lines between our respective spheres remains a problem of enduring difficulty. But it is not only a scholarly problem that faces us. There are also serious practical problems of our common life hidden in these distinctions, problems that beset us whether or not we have any scholarly interest. I can illustrate this not with a service station, but with a church. A year or more ago the Lee C. McDonald, born in 1925, is professor of government and dean of the college at Pomona College, Claremont, California. He holds the B.A. from Pomona College, M.A. from U.C.L.A., and Ph.D. from Harvard University, and is the author of Western Political Theory (Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovitch, 1968). He is a former president of the Southern California Political Science Association and is presently a member of the executive council of the Western Political Science Association and the board of directors of the American Conference of Academic Deans. In 1963 he won the Danforth Foundation's Harbison Award for distinguished teaching and in 1973 was a recipient of Pi Gamma Mu's Honor Key. 162</page><page sequence="2">"social" and "political" 163 minister in my church was, in an episode familiar to many church members, criticized by some conservatives in the congregation for being too explicit about Vietnam and hence bringing "politics" into the pulpit. To support him, I introduced a resolution in the session of the church (the legislative body) which declared support for the Protestant principle of the freedom of the pulpit and right of a pastor to express his understanding of the gospel as it related to political issues. A majority of the session was prepared to support the resolution, but only if the word "political" was deleted and replaced with the word "social." To the session, "politics" implied vituperous rhetoric, election campaigns, corruption, and various other evil things. In the discussion that followed I gave a condensed form of my standard introductory political science lecture on the distinct and proper meanings of "social" and "political." To no avail. Despite my defense of the political, the amendment passed and the church was saved from the taint of association with political - but not social - issues. I will now try to make again the distinction I failed to make for the Claremont Presbyterian Church. America is, or has been for the 200 years of its nationhood, a liberal society and a liberal polity. By that I do not mean that we are necessarily of the left, or without conservative elements. That we may be conservative-liberals I find to be no contradiction, despite popular usages. The opposite of conservative is not liberal, but radical. The opposite of liberal is not conservative, but communitarian. By liberalism I mean belief in the primacy of individualism over communitarianism, scientism over tran- scendentalism, economism over politicism. Each of these three dichotomies is worthy of separate treatment, so I may have to beg a few questions in making my central point, which is that our characteristic confusion over what is social and what is political is a serious confusion that ought to be overcome insofar as it is possible, both for the sake of scholarship and for the sake of our common community life. Partly from this confusion we study the wrong things. Partly from this confusion we act the wrong way. America has been a liberal society and a liberal polity. Individualism, technological progress, mobility, popular education have all been highly valued. In the name of individualism the liberals of the 19th century sought a minimal role for government and elevated the sphere of the private to a preferred position over the sphere of the public. In the name of private enterprise an economic and social system of immense public import was fashioned. As most historians now recognize, the free market economy was not a state of nature, but a conscious contrivance of governmental authority. (If, as both liberals and Marxists assert, economics is prior to politics, why then, when the economy is in trouble, does everyone blame the government?) If the early liberals believed in freeing the individual from feudal restraints and the restraints of law, they did not succeed in freeing him from the restraints of a repressive class system and the tension of a highly competitive, production-oriented economy. Indeed, the concept of "the free individual" is itself an abstraction that was often used to cloak collective deprivations performed on actual persons. The social Darwinists, using an analogy misap- propriated from biology, especially typified this "survival of the fittest" approach. Of course, welfare state liberalism, the New Deal variety, changed much of this by a changed attitude toward the use of governmental power. But the faith in technology and the rhetoric of individualism were still there. Welfare state liberalism and the easy assumption that technology would cure</page><page sequence="3">164 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR SUMMER 1974 all problems have been severly challenged by the events of the 1960's, by the assassinations, the civil rights movement, the urban revolts, the student rebellion, and Vietnam. Books like Theodore Lowťs End of Liberalism? have challenged the reliance on policy making by the lowest common denominator of interest group power struggles and have called for a new sense of common community justice. A whole new body of anarchist thought has found respectability in such works as Robert Paul Wolff's Poverty of Liberalism and In Defense of Anarchism . And, of course, Marxist theory, never far away, has, through the New Left, been resurrected once again. Ironically, however, the primary defects of historical liberalism, a down- grading of the political and a faith in mechanism and process and privatism rather than in rational public debate, are replicated in anarchist and Marxist thought. The variety of anarchisms is immense; but most varieties would, like early liberalism, eliminate all manner of formal structure and rules for the sake of liberating the individual. For both liberalsim and anarchism the chief menace is paternal governmental authority. The first self-conscious anarchist, the man who coined the word, said, "Government is, in all cases, an evil; it ought to be introduced as sparingly as possible. Man is a species of being whose excellence depends on his individuality; and who can be neither great nor wise, but in proportion as he is independent." That was William Godwin in 1793. The most famous of all liberal tracts (though hardly the most characteristic) began, "The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicuous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar." That was John Stuart Mill in On Liberty , in 1859. In 1970 Robert Paul Wolff considered how the moral autonomy of the individual could be reconciled with the authority of the state and concluded that it could not. "Authority resides in persons; they possess it - if indeed they do at all - by virtue of who they are and not by virtue of what they command." All formal, or what Wolff calls de jure , authority "is equally illegitimate, although of course not therefore equally worthy or unworthy of my support." Marxists, by contrast, accept the need for authority, but find it theoretically in the impersonal and abstract form of forces of history and class consciousness, and practically in party cadres. (That benovolent anarchist, Paul Goodman, recently deceased, observed that two key terms of New Left rhetoric, "partici- patory democracy" and "cadres" are mutually incompatible, but nevertheless continue to be used in the same breath by Marxist elements in the New Left.) The new experience of communes muddies the water somewhat. They are necessarily communitarian rather than individualistic, yet they are also seen as escapes from authority in the name of individualism. Moreover, in fact, many are highly authoritarian. Already, of course, both the New Left and the commune experiences seem to be receding. For a time it seemed as if the new political theory required by our age would come out of the New Left or the communes, but the anarchist influence was so strong, and the antipolitical bias of anarchism is so strong, that nothing much of substance has yet appeared from these sources. Among college students there seems to be a conservative backs wing, if not of life style at least of politics. A recent discussion on the rights of property in one of my classes sounded as if it were occurring in the 1950's rather than the 1970's. I have a few students who still talk like Herbert Spencer. They probably existed in the</page><page sequence="4">"social" and "political" 165 late 1960's, too, but were then submerged in the clamor of rebel voices. Even before the Watergate hearings, President Nixon, despite his remarkable electoral sweep, was not the most popular president of modern times; but in stressing governmental economy and decentralization, he has surely been sensing the popular mood. Moreover, one of the ironies of our time is that the animosity toward big government and the affection for the local community are shared most visibly by members of the far left and the far right. We may be only at the beginning of a period of rethinking our basic assumptions. We can note, however, that out of the anarchist 1960's have come some new and significant influences. Works like Peter Kropotkin's Mutual Aid (written in 1902) have been rediscovered. Kropotkin's argument is opposed to the survival of the fittest arguments of the social Darwinists. His work attempted to show that nonhuman species were not in constant struggle but displayed a variety of forms of intraspecies cooperation. Other animals wage war between species but rarely, like man, within their species. He found mutual aid among animals. He found mutual aid among savage tribes. He found mutual aid in medieval cities. "Society has not been created by man. It is anterior to man." His work, obviously defective in some parts, does call to mind the new respect anthropologists have developed for the complexities of what once were regarded as primitive cultures (the work of Lévi-Strauss is notable in this regard). It also calls to mind the new interest in man as an animal. Robert Ardrey's Territorial Imperative and Konrad Lorenz's On Aggression are only the most popular of recent works seeking to give a zoological basis to man's combative tendencies. On the other side, we see the work of persons like John Lilly on the intelligent, gentle, and cooperative dolphins which suggests, like Kropotkin, that no necessity of nature impels us to act out our most destructive side. The logic of those who would justify the more violent behavior of man by reference to animal behavior (and I do not casually lump Lorenz in this camp) may be questioned. Hannah Arendt says that "theriomorphism" (seeing man in the image of animals) may be just as much a logical error as anthropomorphism. It arises, she suggests, primarily because it is easier to experiment with animals than with men. Our methodology dictates our assumptions rather than the reverse. At least, we can say it is easier today to recognize that man is a social animal and to recognize that this means an animal that cooperates for survival rather than an animal that competes for self-interest. The ecological crisis has, I hope, revealed that much to us. But I am suggesting more than this. As social creatures, whether cooperating or competing, we are judged by the standard of biological survival, by service to a natural life process. As political creatures, we must be judged by more than this. Political creatures should be judged by their capacity to imagine, think, argue, decide, and create something new in the world, not just to repeat the life cycle, necessary as that is, but to act, to perform, in the hope of fashioning something of enduring worth. If survival is the first law of nature, a new world is the final hope of politics. Fascinating are the changes in the translation of Aristotle's Politics (1253a), where he says man is a zoon politicon. Man is a political animal. By the late 19th century, under the influence of liberalism's narrowed interpretation of the meaning of politics, this translation was seen as excessively negative and limiting: politics was party rivalry, bossism, and the narrow struggle for power (what the Presbyterian elders still see as politics). Hence there appeared translations reading, "Man is a social animal." In the context of</page><page sequence="5">166 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR SUMMER 1974 the day that may have been better, but it propounded an even worse error. Man is not the only social animal, and Aristotle did not mean to say that only man was a social animaL As generations of writers had acknowledged, ants, bees, and monkeys, as well as man, are social animals. Mandeville's Fable of the Bees was a classic 17th century work of political theorizing which gave us the memorable formula of "private vices" adding up to "public virtue." But, as I have tried to suggest, to be a political animal means more than simply sustaining the life of a species. It means acting (not reacting, but acting) in such a way that new options are created for the whole community. The political question is not "What should I do?" That is a question of personal morals. It is "What shall we do?" To deal with this question, it is not enough to spin out endless statistical correlations. It is not enough to say, "Well, if X holds, then Y obtains." It is not enough to call for further studies. We, the community, must decide: "What shall we do?" Economics (from the Greek word for household) pertains to the realm of material necessity. But material necessity and human choice are different dimensions of existence. Much elegant theorizing about choice by economists has been achieved only by making deterministic assumptions about human behavior or forgetting the human element altogether. Some economists would not even consider economics a social science. At best, questions of whether market choices are real choices or only reflex behaviors have been begged. But recently, many economists have been asking pointed questions about the scholastic tendency to reduce human values to economic value and to reduce economic value to prices. They challenge the assumption of welfare economics that the net growth of economic goods may be taken to be a fixed human good. The new humanistic economics has its counterpart in a new humanistic psychology, sociology, and political science (anthropology has always been humanistic). Narrow behavioralism, treating subjects as if they were only mechanisms, only products of deterministic forces, is under attack (B. F. Skinner notwithstanding). Putting the subject in the Procrustean bed of the most convenient methodology rather than finding new methodologies appro- priate to the nature of the subject is still widely practiced, but increasingly criticized. Political science has perhaps been most guilty of all in ignoring the special character of its subject. Much of what political scientists now study is in fact prepoliticai - the social basis of politics, the economic factors in politics, the anthropological context of political groups. No wonder political leaders are more apt to consult economists, sociologists or psychologists than they are political scientists on matters of public policy. The content of politics is not behavior, but action; not the power of dollars, but the power of speech; not private interests, but public happiness - what Aristotle called eudaemonia, what the 18th century called felicity. Is Walter Kaufman's recent claim that America is suffering from "decidophobia" (the fear of making decisions) related to the psychological avoidance of the public realm? The words that are the biggest "grabbers" in advertising are still "It's free " and "It's new." Yet, freedom and newness of spirit continue to elude us. The culture of advertising presses upon us the notion that each individual should have his own car, his own telephone, his own TV set, his own backyard. We get these things and then wonder why we are lonely and alienated. Liberalism as the ideology of individual freedom still appeals</page><page sequence="6">"social" and "political" 167 to us. But liberalism as the concomitant ideology of justified selfishness may have run its course. As scholars, perhaps we need to work less hard to find new hypotheses for determining subtle but trivial correlations, and harder to find fresh questions about what the important issues are. Science is scientia , not just technique but basic knowledge. As citizens, perhaps we do not so much need new information about existing programs (important as that is) as we need a sense of what public policy is and means. At a typical city council meeting, local residents fill up the council chambers only when their own street or backyard is threatened by a zone change. When that agenda item is finished, the affected parties leave and the chambers empty, even though the next item may be something that affects the whole community. As it now functions, politics is mainly negative protectionism. It ought to be a participatory exercise in creating public happiness. "Public happiness," "public virtue," - even to use such words sounds naive and Utopian. But it should be possible to avoid naivete or utopianism or even excessive idealism to assert, as I am trying to, that words should be used properly, that meanings should be as precise as possible. We hear many cries for a "new society." But what is being call for? New housing? A new criminal code? A new attitude toward authority? A new attitude toward one another? Some new TV programs? We have lost precision of speech, especially in the area of public discourse where it is so difficult to maintain. We confuse private with public (though here more in practice than in speech), behavior with action, and the social with the political. Have I only been playing with words? Can changing our speech habits change the way we act? It is not possible to demonstrate a simple causal connection between changes in language and changes in behavior. The relationship is reciprocal. As a result of becoming an administrator, I find myself using different words and in consequence, perhaps, having different perceptions. I will not repeat the unrepeatable new words; but try these: while the college president is away I "mind the store." I would never have used a commercial metaphor like that if, as a professor, I was left in charge of anything. A new bias favoring the practical and the contemplative is suggested by the comment "the curriculum committee is windmilling on that issue." And a new bureaucratic caution is suggested by the phrase "get it in writing or you'll be sandbagged ." My new position changes my language. Does my language also change my new position? I think so. From purely academic studies, I define terms like "liberal," "conservative," and "political" in special ways and act (some- times even with effect) on the special insights that those definitions accompany. Indeed, what am I doing here but trying clumsily to impart new insights by means of new, or rather more precise, definitions? Of course, it is an old story in social science that the investigator or theorist feels obliged to invent his own lexicon of logically related terms, which no one thereafter follows. The popular jibes at the jargon of social science arise out of this difficulty. Such jargon provoked W. H. Auden's famous 11th commandment: "Thou shalt not commit a social science." It helps explain the businessman's disparagement of the merely academic economist in love with his abstract models. The New York Times reported on some interesting letters to the editor printed in the London Times in November of 1971. The first stated "We, the undersigned, all professors in British Universities,</page><page sequence="7">168 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR SUMMER 1974 do offer as our considered judgment that the disadvantages of England entering the common market outweigh the advantages." The letter was signed by 142 economists. In the next column was another letter: "We the undersigned, all professors of Economics in British Universities, do offer as our considered judgment that the advantages of England entering the common market outweight the disadvantages." And this letter was signed by 156 economists. The following week another letter appeared in the London Times : "I, the undersigned, a typical British businessman, do offer as my considered judgment that the disadvantages of economists making judgments on questions of public policy outweigh the advantages." The terminological conventions in natural science, at least in what Thomas Kuhn calls "ordinary science," are better established than in social science. Partly this is a function of the longevity of the various disciplines, but it is probably more a function of the complexity of social and political phenomena which make wholly new categories forever tempting. The complex reality sits in ironic juxtaposition to the popular notion that social scientists deal with the obvious. Compare the notion of a physiological cell with the notion of a social class. Compare the notion of the Doppler effect with the notion of a historical trend. We should not exaggerate the inherent difference between the judgments of natural science and of social science. A mathematician at Pomona College recently observed that the use of computers in basic mathematics instruction is leading us away from the simple question, "Is it right?" to the less precise but more useful question, "Which of these formulations is better?" His lecture was followed by the lecture of a humanist who made reference to the mathematician's comment and stated that she, as a humanist working on the origins of Beowulf ' could be very precise indeed in answering the question, "Is it right?" Nor would I want to claim too much for the distinction that, as social creatures, we reinforce one another's ways of livelihood and, as political creatures, we create new possibilities for action in the world. But a sense of possibility, a sense of what we can become, requires, in addition to desire and inspiration, clarity of thought and expression, a capacity to grasp what is potential in the actual. We need language that has life within it, that is without the deadness of correct but static data, yet language that is more grounded in reality than the phrases of rhetorical exhortation. The language of social science can be, I think, richer than the language of mathematics (the only language that approaches neutrality) without becoming the inflammatory language of proph- ecy. To go one step further: judgment is inseparable from intention, and hence the language of judgment - whether judgment of morals or science or poli- tics - is never neutral, and the quest for the meaning of the political and the meaning of the social can be and should be at once, without contradiction, a quest for knowledge of what we are, and what we ought to be.
