<plain_text><page sequence="1">The General Will and Social Choiee Theory Benjamin Radeliff The concept of the General Will has been criticized as being either tyrannical or empirically unattainable. From a social choice perspective, Riker (1982) and others have merged the substance of both perspectives. The new argument main- tains that Arrow's Theorem and similar impossibility results imply that the Gen- eral Will is both dangerous and "intellectually absurd." While not denying the relevance of the collective choice literature, it is argued that such apocalyptic conclusions are premature. I The idea of the General Will has long been a thorn in the side of liberal sensibilities. Some have seen the concept as a rationaliza- tion for pseudo-democratic tyranny, asserting that it has served as the ideological foundation of modern totalitarianism.' Others have rejected the General Will on putatively empirical grounds, arguing that it makes demands of citizens that cannot be realized.2 The first critique argues that the General Will is dangerous; the second that it is unattainable. Using social choice theory as a forge, Riker merges the substance of both positions. He maintains that cyclical majorities and associ- ated impossibility results show a generalized version of the General Will ("populism") to be "intellectually absurd."3 The problem, in simple terms, is this: it is impossible to ensure that the results of collective decisions will be meaningfully related to the preferences of citizens. Put another way, if the General Will is discovered by and/or defined by voting games, and if the results of such games cannot be accepted "as a true and fair amalgamation of voters' values," then the General Will does not exist - or, at least, it cannot be determined by any democratic means. Accordingly, the entire notion of the General Will must be rejected, in that it is devoid 1. See, e.g., Bertrand Russell, A History of Western Philosophy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1945). 2.

Like a four-sided triangle, the General Will is a vacuous concept. While he asserts that populism fails "not because it is morally wrong, but merely because it is empty," Riker goes on to show that the unattainability of the populist ideal also implies that attempts to realize that ideal are inimical to liberty in that they provide "a built-in justification for tyranny" in the guise of attempts "to enforce an imaginary popular will." Political arrangements posited on the existence of the General Will must be avoided so as to spare our- selves from "the hatreds and oppression implicit" in such arrange- ments. In essence, the argument is that cyclical majorities reduce the General Will to incoherence. This article suggests that such a con- clusion may be premature. The discussion begins with a brief explication of theory of the General Will, followed by an examina- tion of how the internal logic of that theory fares given the Pandora's Box of the evidence from social choice theory. II In the broadest sense, the theory of the General Will can be reduced to the following pair of propositions:4 (1) What the people, as a corporate entity, want ought to be social policy. (2) The people are free to the extent that (1) is satisfied. While such a definition clearly transcends his work, the founda- tions of this conception of majoritarian or "populist" democracy is conventionally traced to Rousseau. Like Hobbes, Rousseau begins with the notion that all individuals are autonomous agents who share an absolute natural equality. Men are born free, bound to no one but themselves, enjoying unlimited liberty. This state of nature, while not ostensibly the "war of all against all" envisioned by Hobbes, is nonetheless dangerous and uncomfortable. Rational agents come to see that to survive (and to flourish) they must invent cost-sharing mechanisms so as to provide themselves with the public goods of peace and security. In essence, this requires the establishment of civil society and the end of the state of nature. 4. Ibid., p. 238.</page><page sequence="3">36 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS Given that "no man has any natural authority over his fellow men," Rousseau notes that "we have nothing left save agreements to serve as the basis for legitimate authority among men" (Social Contract, 1. 4). To create society - to establish the authority rela- tionships necessary to provide collective goods-there must thus be some form of covenant among individuals whereby they agree to such. This process takes the form of an unanimous consent agreement (denoted as the social contract) in which all individuals assent to the new order. Thus far we are still firmly in the company of Hobbes, having merely an argument for the necessity of a consensual basis for human organization. Rousseau, like Locke, differs from his pro- genitor in explicitly asserting that neither an individual nor a so- ciety can alienate the right to self-determination. If human beings are initially free and equal, it becomes absurd to insist that they can permanently surrender that right upon the act of acceptance of an outside authority. If individuals are truly sovereign they cannot surrender their sovereignty: the very fact that consent was required at one point prohibits the ability to alienate the need for that consent. The consequence is the need for continuing consent to political decision. For Locke, consent is withdrawn by an individual leaving a given jurisdiction, or by society collectively removing the existing governmental arrangement and replacing it with another. Rous- seau, however, goes further. He maintains that consent must be given to the actual outputs of government. Since individuals are bound to obey only themselves, only those laws which they explic- itly consent to are morally binding upon them. Not only must all individuals agree to the creation of the state, then, but they also must agree with the laws promulgated by the state. The problem is thus to find a form of association which is capable of "defending and protecting, with all the collective might, the person and property" of each citizen, but which continues to allow all individuals to "obey only themselves and remain as free as before" (Social Contract, 1. 6). This seemingly involves the reliance upon the unanimity rule in the making of collective decisions, for the only law legitimately binding upon all members of a given society is one that all members have agreed to. Such a conclusion is rather alarming, for unanimity rules not only involve high decision costs, but also tend to act in an antidemocratic fashion by giving each individual veto power. If individuals have a finite, non-zero</page><page sequence="4">GENERAL WILL AND SOCIAL CHOICE 37 probability of opposing each piece of legislation, then the proba- bility that any given piece of legislation will win approval rapidly approaches zero as the number of individuals increases. The result would be that society would not be able to provide itself with the collective goods that are its raison d'etre. Rousseau provides a way out of this quandary via the notion of the General Will, which in effect provides a mechanism for linking unanimity with majority rule. Society, he suggests, should be gov- erned exclusively in terms of the common interests of its members. This shared interest is the public good and is always the object of the General Will. The General Will is to be differentiated from the will of all, for the latter is merely the sum of "particular wills" or assessments of individual self-interest. Thus what the people wish as a"corporate entity" is their collective interest, that is, the General Will, as opposed to merely the sum of their individual interests, or the will of all. In this way, the General Will is the true will of all citizens qua citizen; those who may disagree with its dictates are simply mistaken. Accordingly, if law is a product of the General Will then all individuals must, by definition, assent to it. Laws predicated upon the General Will are thus agreed to by all individ- uals (qua citizen) and are thus legitimate. Alternatively, and departing from Rousseau, we can avoid the emphasis on the transcendental nature of the General Will by constructing it strictly in terms of consent. In other words, it is not necessary to assume that individuals are "mistaken" when they disagree with the General Will, but rather that they are willing to consent to following the General Will, even when they oppose it. In such a scenario, citizens may be genuinely antagonistic to the General Will, but nonetheless accept it as legitimate and hence morally and legally binding. Accordingly, individuals assent to the wishes of the population as "corporate entity" precisely because this entity is morally compelling. In either case, two questions remain: (a) How to discover the General Will? and (b) How to reconcile unanimous consent to the General Will with the fact that there will invariably be dissension, that is, how to reconcile unanimity with majority rule? As to the former, the conventional interpretation is that the General Will exists (or can be discovered) only if all (or most) citizens cast votes in accordance with their perception of what is in the general in- terest. In this way, citizens are expressing not private interests but sincere estimates of what they believe to be in the collective interest.</page><page sequence="5">38 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS Accordingly, the purpose of voting is to find the "truth," that is, to "discover" the General Will. Voters are thus postulated to function as jurors who are ascertaining the truth in re the collective interest. Given that, it is a relatively easy matter to demonstrate that some form of majority rule is the best mechanism for making decisions, assuming that all individuals are marginally more likely to be "cor- rect" than "wrong."5 The greater the required majority, the more certain we can be that the social decision is in fact the right one. In most cases, simple majorities are sufficient to ascertain the "truth," although on issues of particular importance extraordinary majori- ties may be required, in that the stakes involved necessitate greater certitude. Given the above, it is apparent that the General Will may not exist on some matters. By definition, the General Will concerns only the shared interests of society and can be discovered only by a disinterested public searching for "truth." It follows that when voters do not act disinterestedly, or when the subject of voting does not concern genuine matters of social concern, voting will produce the will of all rather than the General Will. Similarly, whenever there is no public consensus, there is no General Will. If, for ex- ample, there is some matter that is so important that it requires a two-thirds majority and such a majority does not obtain, there is no General Will (or, at least, no reliable estimate of it). In sum, we recognize that not all voting games manifest the General Will. The remaining issue of the reconciliation of unanimity with dissent had generated enormous controversy. Following Berlin,6 some have seen the General Will as the perfect symbol of everything wrong with "positive liberty." Rousseau's implicit argument that there is a higher level of freedom and self-actualization that one may not see, and may not consciously will, but which one neverthe- less must be constrained to accept seems (to many) to be both sophistic and illiberal. To maintain that one obtains true ("moral") freedom in civil society, that one becomes truly free because one follows one's own true will (which may not be apparent to oneself) instead of being a slave to "sheer appetite," is the same thinking that breeds the notorious notion that individuals must be "forced 5. For a discussion of this concept in social choice terms, see H. P. Young, "Condorcet's Theory of Voting," American Political Science Review 82 (1982): 1230- 44. 6. Isaiah Berlin, Two Concepts of Liberty (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1958).</page><page sequence="6">GENERAL WILL AND SOCIAL CHOICE 39 to be free." The absolutism that Rousseau has rightly or wrongly come to represent thus rears its ugly and Jacobin head.7 A second and possibly more satisfying approach is to reconstruct the General Will in such a way that avoids this line of reasoning entirely. To do so, we need only postulate that all citizens unani- mously agree to be bound on subsequent decisions by majority sentiment. In other words, there is an unanimous consent agree- ment to accept the results of majority voting. Accordingly, each individual has consented to the resulting decisions. Based upon the notion that one cannot permanently alienate one's rights, we could instead utilize the logically equivalent procedure of reaching a provisional decision based upon majority rule, followed by a ratifi- cation vote; for the provisional decision to be enacted, it would have to obtain an unanimous decision on the second vote. While society is not unanimous before the initial vote, it is afterward. The emphasis is shifted from consent to some proposal per se, to consent to accept the decision reached by a (simple or extraordinary) ma- jority. The result of the provisional decision is not binding because it was not agreed to by all. Instead, it is binding because we all agree to whatever the majority had decided. In this way the final result is unanimously endorsed and hence legitimate. A way has thus been found to ensure continuing, unanimous consent to law without resort to positive liberty. This argument is similar to Locke's view of how citizens, having unanimously accepted the social contract, actually institute a spe- cific form of government: When any number of men have so consented to make one community or government, they are presently incorporated and make one body politic wherein the majority have the right to act and conclude the rest. ... the act of the majority passes for the act of the whole and, of course, determines, as having by the law of nature and reason the power of the whole. . . . And thus every man, by consenting with others to make one body politic under one government, puts himself under an obligation to every one of that society to submit to the 7. The General Will expresses the community's opinion (which is definition- ally correct) about this collective good. Given that each individual is assumed to want what is best for the community (as opposed to what is best for the self), then if the results of voting are contrary to one's preferences, then those preferences are simply wrong. In other words, a citizen may want ("will") what is best for the society, but be mistaken about the substance of that desire, so that they may not be aware of their own will. Hence, they must be "forced" to follow the collective will, which is truly their own.</page><page sequence="7">40 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS determination of the majority and to be concluded by it." (Second Treatise, 18. 95-97). For Locke, the people unanimously agree (a) to join together and (b) to subsequently accept the wishes of the majority as to the form of civil administration that will govern them. We simply institute the concept of unanimous consent to accept majority rule to apply to all laws, not merely initial constitutional questions, and allow for unanimous agreements to follow rather than precede majority voting. For both Rousseau and Locke the obligation to agree to dictates of the majority is inherently moral in nature. The rationale for majority rule is not merely that it is an expedient, pragmatic way of making decisions; nor is it because it is intrinsically fair or because it minimizes decision costs. Tossing a coin is a pragmatic and fair procedure with even lower decision costs. Majority rule is the only legitimate form of decision-making (short of unanimity itself) in that it has a moral dimension. The decision reached by majority voting is binding not merely because it is an outcome we have agreed to accept - for we could just as easily agree to accept the results obtained from tossing fair coins - but because there is something special and unique about the sentiments of the majority. As members of a community (as opposed to atomistic egoists) we share certain bonds. The fact that a majority of us believe, in good faith, that a certain course of action is best for the community has the effect of placing a moral obligation upon us to accept that course of action. The same decision reached by the tossing of coins, the whim of a dictator, or similar arbitrary procedures is not similarly binding. The conclusions reached by majority rule are not arbi- trary, as Kendall notes in his lengthy elucidation of Locke's treat- ment of the subject, "since the judgements of the majority are those of reason and justice."8 For this reason, we derive the fundamental enabling assumption of majoritarian democracy - that what the people as a corporate entity want ought to be social policy - in that the wishes of this entity are those of justice and rationality. 8. Willmore Kendall, John Locke and the Doctrine of Majority Rule (Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1941).</page><page sequence="8">GENERAL WILL AND SOCIAL CHOICE 41 III The above discussion suggests that the intelligibility of the Gen- eral Will depends upon the coherence of majority rule. If the results of voting procedures can produce arbitrary outcomes, then ma- jority rule becomes just another mechanism for reaching societal decisions. It loses its uniqueness and, in the process, the moral dimension that formed the very basis for its legitimacy. If majority voting is incoherent, if it can produce meaningless and arbitrary results, then it does not necessarily produce outcomes which repre- sent the community's sentiments. If so, then it does not produce the General Will. Thus, in the absence of some majority rule (simple or extraordinary) to complete the task, there is simply no (democratic) way to ascertain the General Will. The theory thus becomes inco- herent if majority rule arrives at arbitrary decisions.' Cyclical majorities, of course, imply precisely that kind of arbi- trariness. Given a cyclical outcome, the alternative actually se- lected by the voting procedure is arbitrary, being a function not so much of the preferences or opinions of citizens but of the electoral mechanism in use. In such a situation, the chosen alternative is merely an artifact of the voting procedure. Arrow's Theorem and the related impossibility results from social choice theory show that cycling is endemic in any system of preference aggregation that meets certain minimal conditions of fairness."' Cycles, and hence arbitrary outcomes, are thus part and parcel of democratic proce- dures. The basis of theory of the General Will is that citizens, as a corporate entity, have a will and that this will has a moral dimen- sion. The problem lies in the fact that the General Will is either defined in terms of, or to be discovered by, majority rule. Given the problem of cyclical majorities, the General Will, at a minimum, 9. It might be argued that the General Will cannot be reduced to majority rule or voting games in general. However, it must be understood that the aggregation problem applies to any collective preference (or judgment) that depends upon the preferences (or judgments) of individuals; see note 23 below. Thus, the cycling issue applies whenever the wishes, preferences, interests, judgments, values, or opinions of citizens are thought to define, measure, or discover the General Will. Accordingly, even if the General Will somehow emerges without resort to voting, the fact remains that as long as it is in any way a function of individuals, cycling is a problem. 10. See Jerry Kelly, Arrow Impossibility Theorems (New York: Academic Press, 1978), for a review of the many variants of the general impossibility result.</page><page sequence="9">42 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS cannot be discovered through democratic means. Further, if the General Will is in fact defined as a function of aggregated individual preferences, then it may not only be undiscoverable, it may be utterly nonexistent. Put another way, society is an organic, moral body. The people become a single actor, with the state assuming the role of a moral person. Society becomes a kind of superman whose will carries a moral imperative binding the constituent citizens who comprise it. Given preference cycles, though, the will of this anthropomorphic society becomes literally incoherent. As a result, the moral impera- tive to follow the dictates of the majority no longer exists. As an example, suppose the ostensible General Will, discovered through a voting procedure, indicates that X is the socially preferred alter- native. Now say there is an undetected cycle such that X&gt;Y, Y&gt;Z, Z&gt;X. Nonetheless, we subject society's members to X on the sup- position that X is the General Will. In reality, of course, the Gen- eral Will (on this issue) is either meaningless or it simply does not exist. How can one be said to be free when one is subjected to arbitrary decisions? How can one be free if the will one is submit- ting to is inconsistent, irrational, invalid, and devoid of meaning? It is for the alleged incoherence of majority rule that Riker dismisses the General Will as theoretically incoherent." I believe that this conclusion is overstated. While the aggregation problem presents a clear and unavoidable problem, it does not necessarily render the General Will completely vacuous. First, if voting procedures are conceptualized, as suggested above, as being a tentative vote via majority rule followed by an actual or implied unanimity rule ratification, then arbitrariness is avoidable. The decision derived from the first round, of course, might be the product of a cycle, but the final decision-found through unanimity - cannot. Individuals would simply realize that there was always some chance that the results of the initial vote may not represent the General Will. Although he may not have been aware of the voter's paradox, Rousseau clearly recognized that voting was not an infallible procedure. Cycling outcomes rep- resent just another class of possible errors that are endemic in the use of the procedure. As long as citizens are given the opportunity 11.

Voting is thus not so much an aggregation of prefer- ences, but an aggregation of opinions in which citizens are trying to find out what the group desires. There is thus no incentive to engage in strategic behavior, for one has nothing to win or lose. If the outcome of voting yields a result different from that which one favored, the implication is not that one has lost, but merely that one was mistaken about the General Will. Just as jurors have no personal stake in the result of a trial, citizens qua citizen have no personal interest in the outcome of voting games. The result will be to eliminate (or drastically reduce) the potential for strategic voting, agenda control, and engineered disequilibrium. Conse- quently, the outcomes of voting will be less suspect than normally assumed. Third, while the full body of citizens are envisioned as exercising sovereign authority by acting as a legislature, there is no reason to demand that they address the full range of issues normally associ- ated with contemporary usage of the term legislature. It seems en- tirely reasonable to suggest that the people would decide only on a comparatively small range of high level, abstract issues. Much of the social choice critique is leveled at a straw man version of the General Will which requires the general population to decide the full range of matters traditionally decided by conventional legisla- tures. Instead, we can envision the people delegating most of the day-to-day operation responsibilities of government to either the executive branch or an elected full-time legislature. The sovereign would speak only to fundamentals, and then only in the broadest terms, as in the questions decided by the current system of direct democracy in Switzerland. At the extreme, the people might de- cide, as Locke suggests, only constitutional concerns. Or the Gen- eral Will might be invoked only to decide a handful of contempo- rary political debates on matters that are highly salient, long on the 12. The difficulty with arbitrary outcomes is that individuals may be com- pelled to accept decisions which are not functions of the General Will, which implies that they are forced to accept laws which they have not assented to. However, if all social decisions are made (passively or actually) by unanimity, this problem cannot manifest itself in that arbitrary outcomes cannot obtain under unanimity.</page><page sequence="11">44 THE REVIEW OF POLITICS political agenda, and easily understandable - what Carmines and Stimson call "easy issues."13 It may also be possible to limit invocation of the General Will to issues which may reasonably be reduced to a dichotomy. Such choices, of course, are not subject to cycling. This solution is gener- ally dismissed for two reasons: (a) reducing choices to only two elements itself involves arbitrariness, and (b) even nominally bi- nary choices are subject to cycling if it is possible, as most legisla- tures allow, to introduce amendments. To continue the example of the General Will being roughly analogous to the current Swiss system, it is not entirely clear that either of these objections is compelling. The latter concern is not directly relevant, in that citizens are not capable of introducing amendments; they are pre- sented with a proposal on which they may vote yea or nay. This, of course, raises the former matter: the alternatives presented to them by the government may have been arbitrarily restricted. The question, though, is whether that arbitrariness in presenta- tion makes it impossible to think of the resulting electoral decision as a true expression of the General Will. The Swiss electorate recently decided the question of whether to eliminate their armed forces. The choice set had two elements: yes and no. It is true that the government set the agenda, restricting the multitude of possible alternatives between the status quo and the complete demobiliza- tion of all armed forces to a much simpler choice. However, it is difficult to imagine the mass of citizens (or even professional legislators) making informed and reasoned choices between the full set of alternatives. As both Downs and a large body of empirical research suggest," it is unreasonable to expect most citizens to have either the informational or the cognitive resources necessary to make meaningful choices on the complex and rarefied details of political debate. The purpose of political leadership, as Schattsch- neider suggests,5 is to frame choices for the populace so that they can make intelligent and meaningful choices. Citizens may not be capable of deciding details, but they may be quite capable of de- ciding broad issues, if those issues are framed in the appropriate 13.

If we accept these limitations on the abilities of citizen- legislators, it does not seem perverse to limit their choices to dichot- omies. If choices cannot always be framed in this fashion, it may still be that the a priori probability of majority cycling will be relatively small in that the choice set, if not limited to two elements, should nonetheless remain relatively small.'6 Further, given that the tradi- tional reason why cycles are assumed to be commonplace-new alternatives will be introduced so as to engineer them'7"-it is difficult to imagine in terms of mass electorates. In the Swiss ex- ample, it seems extremely unlikely that anyone would have either the necessary information to engineer a cycle or the capacity to do so, in that such would entail having both control over the agenda and nearly perfect information on the preferences of millions of voters. The overall probability that issues decided by the people may involve cyclical outcomes may thus be low. In a similar vein, extra-ordinary majorities may be sufficient to ensure that voting mechanisms will find the "true" public preference (and hence the General Will) by virtue of the fact that as the proportion of votes needed for selecting an alternative increases, the probability of cyclical outcomes decreases, reaching the limit of 0 for an unanimity rule (i.e., a majority of 100 percent). Further, as the required majority becomes larger, the number of alternatives required to make cycles possible also increases; for a 90-percent majority rule, for example, there must be at least 10 alternatives.'" Accordingly, extra-ordinary majorities not only make arbitrary outcomes less likely, they may also make it possible to completely eliminate cycles by imposing a majority of sufficient size to make the voter's paradox logically impossible. Extra-ordinary majorities have also been shown to be extremely promising in the quest for finding stable equilibria in multidimen- sional voting games. So long as simple majority rule is in use, such games have no equilibria except under extremely restrictive (and empirically implausible) conditions. Further, not only will there be no Condorcet winner, but the resulting cycle may envelop all 16. The a priori probability of cycling increases as the number of alternatives increases. If the set of available alternatives is kept reasonably small, then the likelihood of intransitivities may be (relatively) low. 17. Riker, Liberalism Against Populism. 18.

The implication, clearly, is that on any issue that can be represented in continuous alternatives in a multi-dimensional space, majority rule almost always produces arbitrary outcomes.2" Schofield, Grofman, and Feld, however, demonstrate that supramajorities often allow for a stable result.2' They show, for example, that for two dimensions, "requiring only one voter above a simple majority may make it possible to obtain" a stable outcome. For three or more dimensions, stability can be induced (with certainty) by requiring majorities between two- thirds and three-fourths. Thus, the use of extra-ordinary majorities provides a mechanism for protecting against cyclical outcomes.2 Further, suppose that an arbitrary result has occurred. The alternative selected by the public is merely an artifact of the elec- toral process; it does not represent the General Will. By definition, then, the General Will on this particular issue does not exist. Vo- ting has produced an outcome, but it is one that lacks legitimacy. 19. Richard McKelvey, "Intransitivities in Multi-dimensional Voting Models and Some Implications for Agenda Control,"Journal of Economic Theory 12 (1976). 20. More recent findings in the literature actually suggest that the theoretical instability of voting games may be radically less pernicious than this result sug- gests. In particular, McKelvey's work on the "uncovered set" suggests that out- comes may be bound to a small set of points in the issue space such that all outcomes are majority preferred to all points outside the set (Richard McKel- vey, "Covering, Dominance, and Institution Free Properties in Social Choice," American Journal of Political Science 30 [1986]: 282-314.). If so, then cycling may be virtually irrelevant, in that it will be contained to a very small area of the choice set. 21. Norman Schofield, Bernard Grofman, and Scott Feld, "The Core and Stability of Group Choice in Spatial Voting Games," American Political Science Review 82 (1988): 195-212. 22. Institutions predicated upon the General Will may not be widely affected by cycling for two additional reasons. First, it may be that atomistic preferences evolve into consensus through a process of social accommodation, given that consensus itself may be a valued commodity. In other words, if individuals value agreement, their preferences may change so as to produce consensus (see Elaine Mates, "Paradox Lost- Majority Rule Regained," Ethics 84 [1978]: 282-314). This may be particularly applicable to the two-stage process suggested above, in that unanimity becomes a necessary part of the decision procedure. The second argumentative road would appeal to the literature on structurally induced equi- libria. The literature suggests that organizational structure may eliminate cycles or confine them (even when theoretically capable of including all alternatives) to a relatively small portion of the choice set (see, for example, Kenneth Shepsle, "Institutional Arrangements and Equilibria in Voting Models," American Journal of Political Science 23 [1979]: 27-59). Thus the theoretical instability of political games may not manifest itself to the degree (or with the potentially dire conse- quences) one might otherwise expect.</page><page sequence="14">GENERAL WILL AND SOCIAL CHOICE 47 In such a case, we have what amounts to another variety of the will of all-- a decision reached by the sovereign, but one that is invalid because it does not represent the General Will (although it wears the same trappings). In and of itself, this would not be a problem as long as it was possible to know when it had occurred. If it was known when the General Will had degenerated into the will of all, there would be no difficulty. The decision so reached would simply be declared null and void.23 Unfortunately, it is normally impossible to tell when an arbitrary outcome has obtained. In Riker's words: Outcomes of voting cannot, in general, be regarded as accurate amal- gamations of voters' values. Sometimes they may be accurate, some- times not; but since we seldom know which situation exists, we cannot, in general, expect accuracy. ... We never know what an outcome means, whether it is a true expression of public opinion or not ... the truth and meaning of all outcomes is thereby rendered dubious.24 It may be possible, however, to envision mechanisms sufficient to reveal cycling when it occurs. One rather obvious method is to rely upon paired comparisons of all alternatives. This method could be utilized by either having individuals actually making the necessary binary comparisons, or by having them simply rank order the available alternatives. When the number of alternatives is large, these procedures become taxing (for N alternatives, N(N - 1)/2 23. James Coleman and John Ferejohn, "Democracy and Social Choice," Ethics 97 (1986): 6-25, suggest that it is possible to avoid much of the difficulty flowing from the voter's paradox by assuming that the General Will is not defined by the results of voting. In those situations where a cycle has obtained, it is not necessary to suggest that the General Will is incoherent, but rather that voting has simply failed to reflect it. A similar argument is made by Bernard Grofman and Scott Feld, "Rousseau's General Will: A Condorcetian Perspective,"American Political Science Review 82 (1988): 567-78, in their application of Condorcet's jury theorems to Rousseau. There are two serious problems with this approach. One is that cyclically produced outcomes will be erroneously accepted as indicative of the General Will (and thus the populace will be falsely obliged to accept that result). The second is that the argument implicitly assumes that the voting mecha- nism can be incoherent, but the General Will (which is not defined in terms of voting games) cannot. This view fails to realize that the aggregation problem applies not just to voting but to any attempt - metaphysical or actual- to derive a collective judgment from individual judgments. Simply put, if the General Will is a function of individual judgments or preferences, then the aggregation problem applies to the concept itself, not just to attempts to measure it. 24.

Still, if this procedure suffers from some problems of practicality, it is nonetheless logically sufficient. In any event, less cumbersome and hence more empirically useful systems are imaginable; some have even been proposed.25 If an acceptable procedure for revealing cycles could be developed, we would know for certain whether, in Riker's terms, the outcome "is a true expres- sion of public opinion." If it is, then we would have the General Will. If not, we have only the will of all. Given the crucial point is merely the ability to detect the will of all when it appears, cyclical majorities become rather less damning. The suggestion is thus a research program aimed at effective and easily institutionalized methods for exposing arbitrary outcomes when they occur. IV The impossibility results from social choice theory clearly illus- trate the problems inherent in aggregating individual preferences into collective choices. Concern about the quality of democratic decision, however, is not a new phenomenon. Theorists from Plato to Leo Strauss have been skeptical about the ability of mass elector- ates to make intelligent choices. The conventional critique focused not on the logical sufficiency of the democratic method but on the quality of the human materials whose preferences were to be aggregated. At their core, though, both the traditional and the social choice critique maintain that the democratic method may produce irrational and socially deleterious decisions. The fact that there is always the chance of the public making grievous electoral "errors" has not, in this century at least, won wide acceptance as an adequate reason to abandon democracy. Rather, it has led to a research program designed to specify institu- tional arrangements to protect against the foibles of democratic politics. In similar fashion, the fact that the very operation of the electoral process may, through inherent logical deficiencies, intro- duce additional "errors" need not lead to the rejection of robust conceptions of democracy. Instead, the potential for such errors 25.

In essence, many in the social choice school maintain that the "institutional solution" to the aggregation problem is American liberalism. Power must be diffused among competing govern- mental sectors, avenues for participation limited to minimal form, and as many decisions as possible regulated to market mechanisms. This article has sought to establish that such a conclusion may be incorrect, arguing that if we are willing to take the General Will seriously, it is not entirely clear that the Arrow problem reduces it - and populistic conceptions of democracy - to theoretical inco- herence. It may be possible to specify populist institutions that can adequately protect against the specter of arbitrary outcomes. At a minimum, in the absence of a demonstration to the contrary, populism need not be rejected as a hopelessly unattainable ideal.</page></plain_text>
