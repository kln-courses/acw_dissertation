<plain_text><page sequence="1">Foundations of Biology. By Felix Mainx. (International Encyclopedia of Unified Science. Vol. I, No. 9.) The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1955. Pp. ii + 86. ISs. THIS is one of the few numbers of the Encyclopedia to deal specifically with problems of biology. Professor Mainx has rendered a signal service by his contribution and one is no less grateful to Professor Woodger for his translation. Some restrictions are necessary in a volume such as this, but there is a valuable section discussing the basic disciplines used in biology, morphology, physiology and genetics, as well as an account of the more complex inter- actions between these methods of approach. The final section is an essay 253</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS on the value of speculation in biology. In these two sections which, apart from a brief introduction comprise the work, much valuable material is discussed in a stimulating manner. This discussion is the more valuable because the writings of Hartmann, Biinning, and Ungerer are insufficiently known in this country. However, one might have expected to find in this contribution to the Encyclopedia of Unified Science some mention of N. Rashevsky's views on the applications of topology to problems of biology. In the last section Professor Mainx rightly maintains that a 'philosophy of life' (Weltanschauung) is not to be derived from empirical science. This is true, largely because of the dependence and imperfections of a human mind. Because of their reliance upon sense-knowledge and observations, and the imperfections implied thereby, our minds are limited and given what is perhaps an unfair bias towards empiricism and because of these limitations thus imposed upon our knowledge, a complete 'philosophy of life' is not derivable from empirical science. It is perhaps unfortunate that one receives the impression that Professor Mainx regards this con- clusion more as a personal conviction than as a statement based on reason. There is also some difficulty over the author's seeming distrust of 'final causality' and of 'anthropomorphic psychologizing' (p. 73). Now, in one sense, any human mental activity may be called anthropomorphic psychologising because a theory is an act of the human intellect and based upon the human senses. I imagine that Professor Mainx would concede that the human intellect owes some dependence to that which creates both it itself and the subject matter of its speculations. It would thus be not unreasonable to find traces of this creation both in our minds and in their objects, however differently such traces may appear. Thus there seems no fundamental reason to object to the explanation of a natural phenomenon in 'anthropomorphic' terms, provided that these be taken analogically. This view would seem to be consistent with the beliefs of the author upon which, one gathers, his 'philosophy of life' depends. D. F. COLE</page></plain_text>
