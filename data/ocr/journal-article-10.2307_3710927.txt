<plain_text><page sequence="1">Democracy and Despotism in Primitive Societies: A Neo-Weberian Approach to Political Theory, by RONALD M. GLASS- MAN. Millwood, NY: Associated Faculty Press, 1986, vol. I, 233 pp; vol. II, 273 pp. $60. Glassman has extended the study of political sociology into the area of primitive political systems, developing four ideal type units: the hunting-gathering, the hunting- horticultural or herd-hunting, the horti- cultural village, and the herding-nomadic. Because of his intent, the political process is the beginning of the chain of causality. The pattern of power distribution is thus crucial to the society overall and also to each of the institutions within the society. Thus what Glassman writes about religion is the nature of the power structure in the religious system, and the power of religion in the shaping of the type. It is therefore a selec- tive perspective, interesting, challenging, fitting to his purpose, but it is incomplete as an analysis of the place of religion in society. This review is also incomplete as it is selectively concerned with what is said about religious systems in the types. Glassman finds the source of religion in the fear of death and in existential anxiety and despair. The response to this is to develop means for comfort, but at the same time the methods of comforting also produce fear. From his political perspective he focuses on leadership, and the leaders thus are the developers of the religious pattern. They pro- duce a stock of mystical knowledge that can be "extended to explain the history, the rules, and the leadership roles of the par- ticular society in question. Mystical know- ledge then becomes political knowledge and political knowledge gains a magical quality" (vol. I, p. 65). This sets the stage for the significance of religion and religious leaders in his four types of society. Depending on other characteristics of the society, they may accrue greater or lesser power, thus being sources of despotism or, if limited in that process, being more democratic. A critical factor in societies "is the amount of leisure time the people have" (vol. I, p. 65). As hunting-gathering bands are marginal societies, devoted to meeting basic needs for survival, there is little time for the development of complex religious structures, although religion exists. The democracy of the band is thus not threatened by the development of a religious hierarchical struc- ture, the leadership of which could poten- tially develop significant power.</page><page sequence="2">In the hunting-horticulture or herd- hunting type, the form of social organization is the tribe in which there are clans, warrior fraternities, and a formal council of elders. War chiefs and shamans have emerged as leaders. The shaman role is in response to the answer to the theodical question, which is that there are forces beyond mankind and the objective universe - a spirit world which the shaman seeks to control but can do so only partially. This limits the development of legitimate power and the accrual of wealth and privilege, as does the competition with warrior chiefs and the council of elders. Charisma is critical to all leadership roles. In combination they limit the development of a hierarchical society, allowing the con- tinuance of a basically democratic political structure. Horticulture led to the passive accep- tance of and domination by nature and ritualized work patterns, a milieu which allowed a focus on religion as central to life. The role of women was greatly enhanced as their activities in agricultural production were seen to be akin to the mystique of life production, and thus closer to the spiritual world. In religious practice the theodicy re- mains as before but the emphasis shifts from incorporeal to corporeal, a concretization of gods and spirits, dominating the psyche of the horticulturalists. "IRieligious ideology and religious behavior became the dominant characteristics of these societies. Politics itself . . . would become synonymous with reli- gious observance" (vol. II, p. 27). Not with- out a struggle against the influence of the women, a despotic theocracy, dominated by a collusion of the shamans and elders, became the political form. Intensification of warfare is seen as characteristic of herding-nomadic societies. There was a centralization of power in the war chief, the king. All other roles, including that of shaman, became subservient to that of the king. The effect, religiously, is the development of an anthropomorphic mono- theism, primarily as war god. Again we have clearly a despotic system, with total power in the king, a power to be sustained by charisma or, if that fails, by sheer force.
