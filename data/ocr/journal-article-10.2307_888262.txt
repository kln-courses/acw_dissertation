<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Reviews London Louise Bourgeois The exhibition of Louise Bourgeois's recent work, a selection of sculpture and a small number of cognate drawings from 1996 to 1997, at the Serpentine Gallery, London (closed 10th January) was a reduced form of the show originally curated by the Mus&amp;e d'art contemporain de Bordeaux, which also travelled to Belem and Malm6. Although the number of pieces shown was limited by the space avail- able at the Serpentine, they had been thoughtfully selected to reveal the range and quality of Bourgeois's recent produc- tion and they were placed and lit with evi- dent care. Two symbolic themes permeated the show - the spider and its threads, and clothes and the absent female wearer. The centrepiece, lurking behind a dividing wall, was the gigantic Spider (Fig.64), whose welded steel legs five metres high, crouch ambivalently between threat and protection over the central cell of the sculpture. Bour- geois identifies the spider and its self-con- tained work of stitching tapestry with the world of her own mother. The cell (Clothes) is clearly an isolation cell; it is surrounded by closed doors and entrance is barred to the outsider who is restricted to partial glimpses of the interior through broken and dusty windows, one of which bears the finger- printed inscription 'Men/Hombres'. This partially visible, intimate and protected interior is spatially defined by hanging garments including a well-worn coat on which is written in a vertical layout reminis- cent of Holzer, the phrase, 'The cold of anx- iety is very real'. The other works all related directly to the body, largely through its missing traces marked by worn and intimate clothing, clothes with a history of use, once glamorous, now melancholic. Bourgeois is always the sculptor, knowing the relative weight of things, the sense of tension and 65. Untitled, by Louise Bourgeois. 1996. Cloth, wood and steel, 258 by 274 by 163 cm. (Exh.

She is not and never has been a surrealist, but she does ex- ploit an engaging gift for spying out and transforming suggestive found objects such as the tree bole whose anthropomorphic possibilities are realised with the addition of a prosthetic hand (Fig.65). Bourgeois's work over the last decade has attracted a burgeoning following, leaping generation gaps and influencing students and young artists in search of a symbolic and formal language adequate to express the complexities of female experience. This exhibition and the publicity it has received should win wider appreciation from a more general public, but this does trigger some critical issues. Bourgeois's symbolism is dir- ect and accessible, and in less experienced hands would certainly risk lapsing into the obvious, but how far and for how long can she insist on exploiting a narrowly autobio- graphical compulsion as the subject of her work? There remains the danger that our interest in the art becomes over-dependent on the personal story so readily propounded by the artist of her constant obsessive anger and sense of betrayal aroused by memories of her father and her governess, which now, through the distance of time, take on for the modern reader something of the allure of literature. In fact, what the viewer is most likely to have taken away from this exhibi- tion is a sense of celebration of the licence to radicality that advanced age can occasion- ally bring to an artist of unusual vitality. The exhibition catalogue,' with texts in French and English, contains a number of valuable interpretative essays, including a richly argued study by Paulo Herkenoff, L.B.: The Unmentionable, Blades, Fabrics and Fashion, as well as a biographical section con- taining some revealing documentary photo- graphs. In Bourgeois's case the dynamic of artistic recognition has not followed a con- ventional course, as becomes evident from reading the recently published collection of her writings and interviews.2Although a few excerpts are provided from diaries and cor- respondence of the 1930s, only tantalising glimpses are offered of the life of a student at the Paris academies and of the contention between modernist and conservative forces in art education. But there are many insights available, such as Bourgeois's attraction to the artistic temperament of Francis Bacon and an intriguing character sketch of Mir6 as 'a true naive'.3 What certainly emerges is her fruitful dialogue with feminism in the 1970s, which both focused her motivation and output on the legitimacy of centring her art so directly on personal experience and, in return, provided the women's art move- ment with a powerful example of a female artist seemingly bypassed by a patriarchal art world. This well-produced volume will serve as an invaluable source for research into the specific conditions ofBourgeois's life and work but - because of the increasingly self-absorbed nature of the discourse - dis- appointingly little emerges about the art world or the individuals she encountered in Paris and New York over those crucial decades.
