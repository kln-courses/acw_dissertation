<plain_text><page sequence="1">MILTON QUARTERLY 17 Godhead and Milton's Satan: Classical Myth and Augustinian Theology in Paradise Lost Wolfgang E. H. Rudat In Book IV of Paradise Lost, Milton gives us the following description of Adam's and Eve's prelap sarian embrace: hee in delight Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms Smil'd with Superior Love, as Jupiter On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds That shed May Flowers; and press'd her Matron lip With kisses pure: aside the Devil turn'd For envy, yet with jealous leer malign Ey'd them askance . . . (IV. 497-504).1 The epic simile with which Milton describes our Grand Parents' prelapsarian union seems to have a specifically narrative function. For it is interesting to note that, after first comparing Adam to the impreg nating Jupiter, Milton in a later simile compares Satan to the father of the gods, namely, to the Jupiter who on two occasions had turned into an impregnating serpent: pleasing was his shape And lovely, never since of Serpent kind. Lovelier, not.. . [that] to which transform'd Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore Scipio the highth of Rome. (IX. 504-10) If the terms of the two comparisons Adam/Jupiter and Satanic-Serpent/Jupiter are to be strictly ob served, then Satan as serpent tries to attain a status analogous to that of the cloud-impregnating Jupiter in Book IV, i.e., Satan jealously attempts to usurp Adam's place and seduce Eve, sexually. For although Satan, as he himself points out, can feel "neither joy nor love" he can feel "fierce desire" (IV. 509) —and that is exactly what Satan feels as he witnesses Adam's and Eve's embrace. It is in the terms of a sexual reaction, then, i.e., in anthropocentric terms, that Milton represents Satan's causing of the Fall. Book IX shows Satan over whelmed by the "Pleasure not for him ordain'd" (470) and overcome with "sweet/ Compulsion" (473-74), and he tells Eve: thy Beauty's heav'nly Ray ... compell'd Me thus, though importune perhaps, to come And gaze, and worship thee of right declar'd Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. (IX. 607-12) Especially the terms Compulsion and compell'd suggest that Satan is sexually aroused by Eve's attractiveness. In William Empson's interpretation, "Eve turned into a snake and became Satan's consort."2 And indeed, a strict observance of the terms of the allusions both to the mythological serpents and to the cloud-impregnating Jupiter seems to suggest that Milton is implying that Satan impregnates Eve, as Satan does according to the Rabbinical tradition.3 But then the two impregnating mythological snakes are after all symbols, phallic symbols. Therefore, when in order to attain a status corresponding to that of the seducing Jupiter Satan takes on the form Jupiter had assumed, he becomes a phallic symbol. In other words, the Serpent does not have intercourse with Eve; instead, Satan, advancing like a cobra, "erect/ Amidst his circling Spires" (IX. 501-2), worships the "universal Dame" with what can be called a phallic dance. Eve is fascinated by the Phallic Serpent—unconsciously, since she is still innocent— and it is in part through this phallic dance that Satan seduces Eve into eating the Forbidden Fruit, an experience which she subsequently shares with Adam. After their Fall, Adam's and Eve's sexuality is governed by lust; I shall elaborate on the aspect of lust later in this inquiry. Milton describes their first postlapsarian indulgence as follows: Flow'rs were the Couch, Pansies, and Violets, and Aphodel, And Hyacinth, Earth's freshest softest lap. There they thir fill of Love and Love's disport Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seal, The solace of thir sin, till dewy sleep Oppress'd them, wearied with thir amorous play. (IX. 1039-45) As has been noted, Milton's description of the site of Adam's and Eve's lustful coitus alludes to the scene of Zeus' and Hera's union in Homer's Iliad, XIV. 346 ff.4 There, too, after the love-making the two partners fall into a deep sleep. The allusion seems to suggest that Adam's and Eve's postcoital fatigue is a punish ment for having aspired after godhead by eating of the fruit which Satan had promised would make them like gods. Adam and Eve attain a status that ironically is even inferior to their original nature, a</page><page sequence="2">18 MILTON QUARTERLY status that is characterized by "grosser sleep/Bred of unkindly [i.e., unnatural] fumes" (IX. 1049-50, italics added). In the allusive context Zeus' and Hera's sleep likewise is unnatural: gods are not subject to the effect which is described by the proverb Post coitum omne animal triste, but Hera, in order to enable Poseidon to help the Greeks, had engaged Morpheus' assistance to put Zeus to sleep. The tragic irony is that in their prelapsarian state Adam and Eve had like gods not been subject to the proverbial post coitum effect: they had indeed possessed some sort of godhead, as I shall demonstrate in a moment. What would also seem to be allusively operative is the following contrast between the two scenes that serve as a frame: the contrast between, on the one hand, the Jupiter and Juno who, through the simile that describes Adam's and Eve's prelapsarian embrace, are endowed with Edenic aspects and, on the other hand, the Zeus and Hera in the Iliad passage to which the description of the postlapsarian union alludes, i.e., a Zeus and Hera whose union springs from anything but "superior Love." I stated above that Adam's and Eve's postcoital fatigue is a punishment for having aspired after godhead. Milton underscores this idea when he conflates the Homeric analogue with a passage in St. Augustine's City of God. In his description of our Grand Parents' postlapsarian union, Milton is for the purpose of contrast alluding to St. Augustine's (hypothesizing) characterization of the prelapsarian sex act: Atque inter se coniugum fida ex honesto amore societas, . . . et mandati sine labore custodia . . . non lassitudo fatigabat otiosum, non somnus premebat invitum. Between husband and wife there was a loyal bond springing from chaste love . . . God's command of reproduction was carried out without any labor. Love's disport did not weary them, nor did unwanted sleep oppress them. (De Civitate Dei. XIV. 26)5 Milton's term Oppress'd is a direct verbal echo of St. Augustine's premebat: the postlapsarian sex act leads to the proverbial post coitum effect. Before the Fall the sex act would have been performed sine labore, without any effort. But for his disobedience to his superior, to God, man was punished by losing authority over his own inferiors, his flesh: "Per iustitiam dominantis Dei, cui subditi servire noluimus, cara nostra nobis quae subdita fuerat, non serviendo molesta [est]" (De Civ. Dei, XIV, 26). C. S. Lewis has noted that when Milton places a lustful indulgence immediately after the Fall he is following St. Augus tine's thesis that by disobeying God man lost conscious control over his reproductive organs.6 What also needs to be pointed up is why Adam and Eve fall into a sleep of exhaustion: the sex act is carried out like all other postlapsarian activities—in the sweat of man's brow. According to St. Augustine prelapsarian sexuality would have been controlled not by lust but by man's volition, and the male would have been able to simply will an erection: Eo voluntatis nutu moverentur membra ilia quo cetera, et sine ardoris inlecebroso stimulo cum tranquillitate animi et corporis nulla cor ruptione integritate infunderetur gremio maritus uxoris. The sex organs would have been moved by the will like the other limbs; and the husband, free from the stimulus of lust, would have joined his wife's lap with the peace of mind and with his body's integrity uncorrupted. (De Civ. Dei, XIV. 26) It seems to me that when Milton described the con trolled movements of the Serpent (IX. 494-528 and 631-40) he had in mind St. Augustine's rather vivid description of the controlled agility of the prelapsarian phallus (De Civ. Dei, XIV. 24). If this is indeed the case, then the Satanic Serpent might well symbolize the prelapsarian phallus, so that the punishment inflicted upon man, i.e., the loss of authority over his erectile tissue which is now no longer subject to his will but instead to a nervous system that is autonomic, is symbolically expressed when the serpent, which had walked in an upright position before the Fall, is after Original Sin condemned to crawl on its belly. Satan revenges himself on God by emulating the godhead of the chief deity in Graeco-Roman religion and using his arrogated status to corrupt man. For this rebellious act of hubris the instrument of the corruption, the Serpent, receives a punishment analogous to that which according to St. Augustine was imposed on man for his disobedience toward God. Paradise Lost represents man's disobedience as the aspiration after godhead. This coveted godhead is through the allusion in the description of the postlap sarian union adumbrated as pagan: as a status like that of Zeus and Hera, i.e., as a state of godhead like</page><page sequence="3">MILTON QUARTERLY 19 the one that is represented by the Satanic Serpent. In other words, Adam and Eve are like the Serpent reduced to an inferior status, and ironically this status will be similar to that of Zeus and Hera in the allusive context as well as throughout Homer's and Virgil's epics: full of quarrels instead of the "superior Love" that had characterized their original nature. The above reading would furnish an answer to a question that will almost automatically be raised concerning Milton's use of the Jupiter-Juno simile. In his study of the classical background of Milton's epic, Davis P. Harding notes that in the description of Adam's and Eve's prelapsarian embrace the reference to Jupiter's cosmic embrace is puzzling: Why, for example, this early in the poem does Milton risk a comparison with Jupiter and Juno, whose marital relationship was scarcely ideal even by Olympian standards? It does little good to say that Milton had a naturalistic Jupiter and Juno in mind; no amount of ex plicitness could wholly protect the passage from surreptitious intrusion of the less flat tering associations.7 The point is that in his simile Milton is representing the Jupiter-Juno relationship not in the naturalistic terms of the cosmic union to which he alludes, namely, the cosmic union which Virgil had described in the Second Georgic: vere tument terrae et genitalia semina poscunt. turn pater omnipotens fecundis imbribus Aether coniugis in gremium laetae descendit, et omnis magnus alit magno commixtus corpore fetus. avia turn resonant avibus virgulta canoris, et Venerem certis repetunt armamenta diebus. In spring the soil swells and calls for life giving seed. Then Heaven, the Father al mighty, comes down in fruitful showers into the womb of his joyous spouse, and his might with her mighty frame comingling, nurtures all growths. Then pathless copses ring with birds melodious, and in their settled time the herd renews their loves. (Ge. II. 324-29)8 What has not received sufficient attention is how Milton transforms the situation in the Georgics passage. While in Virgil Jupiter's union is with Earth, here it is with his wife who significantly, as Spenser had put it, is lord "of the ayre":9 unlike the Virgilian original, and unlike the opening lines of the Canter bury Tales where Chaucer imitates the Georgics passage by representing spring rain as the impregna tion of earth by the sky, Milton's simile describes a cosmic union that does not involve earth and could indeed be called ethereal—and perhaps one could say that the cosmic union is represented as taking place on a spiritual level. Such a cosmic union predates Virgil's and Chaucer's naturalistic spring rituals by aeons: it is in a sense a "prelapsarian cosmic union." This union becomes "postlapsarian," and the Edenic Jupiter and his consort are reduced to representatives of the naturalistic principle, when Adam and Eve fall. Milton, then, has vested man with the power to cause the downfall of gods. This emphasis on man's status constitutes a departure from the theocentrism of Virgil where Jupiter and his consort govern the reproductive instinct in this world, at least in the animal world, and this emphasis on man is also a departure from the medieval theocentrism in Chaucer where the union between April and March alias sky and earth provides a divine stimulus for the sexually oriented behavior of man: while some of Chaucer's pilgrims, e.g. the Wife of Bath, speak openly about their carnal appetites, the bawdiness of some of the tales stems from the sexual motivation that the pilgrims derive from the cosmic union.10 In a cour ageous anthropocentric maneuver, Milton endows Adam's and Eve's union with the cosmic aspects which classical mythology attributes to Jupiter and his consort but which are here in a more ethereal form extended to Jupiter and Juno only by virtue of Adam's and Eve's prelapsarian status: Jupiter and Juno here represent Adam's and Eve's godhead, i.e., that degree of divinity which Adam and Eve possessed before they fell. Milton seems to be underscoring his anthro pocentric representation of Original Sin by the way in which he adapts the Virgilian cause-effect sequence. In the Georgics passage the cosmic union instills animals with the reproductive urge; in Milton's passage Adam's and Eve's "cosmic embrace" not only has a similarly stimulating effect, but the human embrace actually affects a spirit, Satan. However, since unlike the animals in the Georgics Satan is not filled with the reproductive urge but with "fierce desire," the Satanic Serpent is after Original Sin reduced not to a representative of the naturalistic principle like his analogue Jupiter—both as phallic snake and as impregnating rain—but to the symbol of a phallus incapable of impregnation. In fact, if we follow Anton Ehrenzweig's psychoanalytic reading of the Genesis account, then the serpent's punishment symbolizes castration.11</page><page sequence="4">20 MILTON QUARTERLY Even Milton's prelapsarian Serpent, unlike the mythological Jupiter-turned-snake, cannot be inter preted to be a potential sex partner for Eve. What speaks against Empson's reading is that after Eve had begun eating the Forbidden Fruit, "Back to the thicket slunk/The guilty Serpent, and well might" (IX. 784-85). It could be for the following reasons that the Phallic Serpent "well might" retire. Eve seems to be having a sexual experience of sorts when she eats the Fruit: her rash hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: Back to the Thicket slunk The guilty Serpent, and well might, for Eve Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else Regarded . .. (IX. 780-87) The fruit is a vaginal symbol,12 and partaking of the fruit implies on a symbolical level gaining sexual knowledge of the vulva, both later when Adam eats of "that fair enticing Fruit" (IX. 996) and now where Eve is tasting (in the sense of sapere, i.e., getting to know by tasting) her own vagina. I would even go so far as to interpret this as an act of masturbation, an act in which Eve becomes "Satiate at length" (792). Be that as it may, Eve's fascination with the phallic symbol leads her to an awareness of her own vulva, an awareness that is lust. Intent on knowing her own "Fruit," she now completely ignores the Serpent which previously had intrigued her so much. Satan, how ever, has achieved his goal: he has destroyed Eve's innocence by making her subject to lust. Yet although it is Satan who causes Eve to commit Original Sin, her Fall is represented in strictly anthropocentric terms: she is only exercising her free will, and in the sexual sector of her act of disobeying God and eating of the Tree of Knowledge she develops a self-knowledge that is lust. In fact, even Satan's seduction of Eve is represented in anthropocentric terms: while he speaks of godhead he intrigues the female with a phallic dance. On the other hand, Milton's representation not only of the Fall but also of prelapsarian Adam's and Eve's status in anthro pocentric terms is perfectly consonant with the sacredness of his subject. After all, man had been created in God's own image, which gave him a measure of godhead: with respect to man's prelap sarian status, anthropocentrism and theocentrism are identical. Or to put it more cautiously: both aspects are integrated into each other. Any creation myth in which man describes a god as creating man in his image has an anthropocentric orientation—despite the statement that God is the origin and center of everything. It was perhaps in order to restore the balance between the two orientations that Milton compared Adam's and Eve's embrace to that between Jupiter and Juno—as if the two Olympian deities had, like the God of Genesis, been the origin of all and the model after which man, male as well as female, was formed. Milton thus (re-)integrates anthropocentrism into theocentrism, into a theocen trism which, while it is based on a pagan system of anthropomorphic gods,13 is expressed in the terms of Augustinian theology.14 University of Houston NOTES 'Milton citations are to Merritt Y.
