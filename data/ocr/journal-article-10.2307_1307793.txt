<plain_text><page sequence="1">Features and News Stress Science, Not Ethics- Animal Experimentation: The Battle Lines Soften Humanitarian activists have brought ani- mal welfare to center stage in the theater of science politics, and for the first time the scientists themselves are playing a leading role. Some even predict that a new scientific discipline on the applied science of animal welfare, incorporating principles of animal ethology, physiolo- gy, and comparative medicine, may be emerging. The latest sign of this trend is the new Scientists' Center for Animal Welfare, the first wholly science-based humanita- rian group in this country. The new cen- ter comes on the heels of a revised guide for laboratory animal care issued by the Institute for Laboratory Animal Re- sources (ILAR) of the National Acad- emy of Sciences, which incorporates many of the provisions these groups had been seeking. A half-dozen scientific meetings on animal welfare are planned for the next few months; several major articles have appeared recently; and an important new book, Alternatives to Ani- mal Experiments, was just released by a mainstream group of British research- ers-the Research Defense Society. Whether this flurry of activity leads to a new discipline, however, is secondary to the main message in today's debate about animals: Badly treated animals make for bad scientific results, and sci- ence suffers-in terms of both knowl- edge and public image-when investiga- tors fail to treat animals humanely and thoughtfully. "Investigators are still a little sensitive about humane-type issues, and they be- come defensive," says Tom Wolfle, as- sistant chief of the carnivore unit at the NIH Animal Center in Poolesville, Maryland. "It's easier to show them how [inhumane treatment] affects their data than it is to say, 'Be kind to that fuz- zy animal.' " The evidence is mounting that sloppy care of animals does indeed affect scien- tific data. Dogs who develop "kennel- osis," for example, live in such intense fear in the lab that their adrenal output shoots up and their platelets aggregate. "They're unusable for most biomedical research," says Wolfle, who oversees the foxhound kennels at the Animal Center and issues some 120,000 dogs a year to NIH investigators. In Europe, conventional scientific wis- dom regarding the "at rest" blood levels of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) was shattered by an experiment showing that previously demonstrated AMP levels were abnormally high, an artifact of in- vestigators' handling of the experimental animals. Researchers had been simply picking up test rats by the tail, swinging them across the table, placing them onto guillotines, and chopping off their heads. The rats' livers were then removed and the high AMP levels dutifully recorded. But the rats had been terrified before their deaths, and the fear affected their catecholamine output. In a set of experi- ments conducted in Germany in 1972, Farupel and his colleagues took the time to train rats to accept placement in a double guillotine without fear, so that when the blades finally fell they were not expecting to be killed. These tests re- vealed a level of resting AMP in the liver that was half the amount that had been considered normal. "It's unscientific not to consider that animals have feelings," says veterinari- an and ethologist Michael Fox, director of the Institute for the Study of Animal Problems (ISAP), a two-year-old divi- sion of the Humane Society of the United States. "Those of us concerned with animal rights must address the question of optimal [research] environ- ments to satisfy their behavioral needs." Not to take those needs into account, he says, "could be as detrimental to the ex- periment as ignoring their nutritional needs." Fox says he is derided by fellow-scien- tists for his "anthropomorphism." He counters that he's merely expressing em- pathy and fellow-feeling. "Scientists have the two things confused. Fellow- feeling for an animal does not mean mak- ing it into a little person." In 1968, when he chaired an ILAR subcommittee on laboratory animal ethology, Fox says he was told "you can't really tell whether an animal is happy; the main thing is that it should be healthy for the investiga- tor." Fox says the two are intertwined. "The LD-50 (based on toxicity tests in which animals are exposed to a new compound until one-half the sample dies) is dramatically changed when a rat is put in a cage alone," says Fox. In govern- March 1979 145</page><page sequence="2">ment studies conducted in the 1960s, he says, rats caged in social groups could withstand doses of the anti-asthma drug isoproterenol as high as 815 mg/kg be- fore half of them died. Among rats caged singly, the dose required to kill half of them was only 118 mg/kg. "That isolated rat is not a 'normal' animal," Fox says. Similarly, a monkey caged alone during experimentation will develop skin prob- lems that lead to self-mutilation, so greatly does it feel the absence of social grooming. Neither is that monkey nor- mal, says Fox. What Is "Normal"? The definition of a "normal" experi- mental animal continues to plague bio- logical researchers and animal breeders alike. The animal's life is one of cages, lab chow, and experimental manipula- tion, and an animal bred most closely to resemble its feral relatives would prob- ably wreak havoc with experimental data. Wolfle says he aims for a mixture of both qualities of the wild and qualities suited for captivity without fear. Like many other animal breeders, he allows his hounds freedom to live outdoors dur- ing certain periods of their upbringing, but he also sees that they are "social- ized" to the ways of the lab-responding to a caretaker, accepting a leash, learn- ing to stand on a table. Thus, he says, he provides NIH researchers with animals that are healthy and able to adjust to the experiments without undue stress. If he knows the particular experiment for which the dogs are destined, Wolfle goes one step further: taking them through mock trials of the procedures they'll un- dergo (weekly bleeding, for instance) so that the real thing, conducted by strang- ers in unfamiliar surroundings, won't be as fearsome. The new Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, prepared by ILAR on contract to NIH, emphasizes the relationship between lab conditions and experimental results. Certain envi- ronmental factors are known to modify animals' biological responses, the report notes, such as "exposure to various chemicals and drugs, method of han- dling, population density, cage type, noise, photoperiod, temperature, humid- ity, and ventilation." Even such common contaminants as eucalyptol and vinyl chloride, present in low concentrations in the air fresheners and disinfectants used in labs, "can in- duce or inhibit hepatic microsomal en- zyme activity in animals," the guidelines state. Bedding materials can also affect hepatic microsomal enzymes in mice and rats; pine and cedar are specifically men- tioned as woods to avoid. Mycotoxin contamination of food and bedding may cause subtle changes in the structure and function of certain systems, as can heavy metal contamination in foods: lead con- tamination can affect renal and central nervous system functioning, cadmium can cause hypertension, and mercury can injure tissue in fetuses and immature animals. Antibiotics, which also some- times contaminate food, can affect the intestinal microflora, growth rate, and disease resistance of experimental ani- mals, and estrogenic substances in foods can significantly damage breeding. Just as physical environment can af- fect experimental results, so can behav- ioral environment, says Fox. If an ani- mal is excessively bored or isolated, these deficits may lead to physiologic changes. "We don't know what their be- havioral needs are, but we can devise ex- periments to ask the animals questions" about how they would best like to occu- py their time, he says. Edward Bennett and his associates at the University of California (Berkeley), for example, al- lowed certain rats such amenities as lad- ders, nest boxes, and exercise wheels, and found that these "enriched environ- ment" rats developed larger brains than did their littermates confined to smaller, barren cages. Zoologist Lee Kavanau of the University of California (Los Ange- les) found that nocturnal wild deer mice run for miles each night on exercise wheels when they are supplied, and seem to prefer to regulate such environ- mental factors as the amount of light in their cages. Captivity, Kavanau found, "markedly distorts" the behavior, social interactions, and learning and memory capacities of the mice. Moreover, tests conducted in a "Columbia Box" devel- oped in the 1930s revealed that, for the sake of some varied stimulation, mice are willing to cross electric grids time and again in order to reach a complex maze at the other end of the cage. Some scientists, whom Fox calls "re- ductionist," are likely to protest that en- vironmental flexibility and control in- troduces too many variables into the experimental design. But if self-regula- tion of light and heat is considered to be too many variables, "then you shouldn't use animals," Fox says. "If such great precision is required, there are alterna- tive methods to use-computer simula- tion, microorganisms, in vitro models, or tissue culture." Animals for Research The matter of when alternatives to ani- mals should be used in biological re- search raises the hackles of many scien- tists. It was the topic of a lively symposium sponsored by ILAR in 1975, which for the first time brought together scientists and humanitarians to discuss the issue (see January 1976 BioScience, pp. 9-12). Humane groups say that when they speak of "alternatives" they mean not total replacement of experimental animals, but reduction in numbers and refinement of technique to yield the most efficient use of animals. Some scientists, however, are sensitive to the implication that improvements can be made in the number and types of animals now used. Alternatives to animals "are already utilized to the maximum extent, where appropriate," says veterinarian Thur- mon Grafton. He is executive director of the National Society for Medical Re- search (NSMR), a long-time proponent of "the freedom of investigators and teachers to use laboratory animals with- out unduly restrictive rules and regula- tions." Tissue culture and in vitro tests are fine for "feasibility studies," Grafton says, "but to draw the bottom line, you have to do [the test] in intact animals. When you're dealing with biological phe- nomena, you can obtain answers to your questions only from something that is living." Few scientists would disagree with Grafton about the value of intact animals in biological research. The interaction of homeostatic systems in live organisms often leads to surprising results: The synergistic effects of a drug on the liver, for example, is totally missed if the in- vestigators think they are looking for its effects on the kidney and therefore have chosen to work with a culture of kidney cells alone. "The basis of scien- tific value is to be able to replicate the results," says Nancy Muckenhirn, a pri- matologist at ILAR. "And you can't rep- licate it until you've at least described [the living system]. We're still in the de- scriptive stage." Muckenhimrn says even lower forms of animals can add to scientists' descriptive abilities. The study of the squid axon, which is relatively large, has yielded much classic information about the func- tioning of the nervous system; similarly, much useful basic work in reproduction and fertilization was conducted on am- phibians. Pathologist George Race has pointed to the value of comparative physiology, using intact animals, for un- 146 BioScience Vol. 29 No. 3</page><page sequence="3">derstanding of human systems. Studying the unique ability of the diving seal to adapt to oxygen depletion, he notes, could yield important information to ap- ply to human stituations of oxygen depri- vation. And wild giraffes are useful in re- search into cerebral hemorrhages, since their cerebral blood pressure elevates from 125/75 (within the normal range for humans) when the head is erect to 280/ 180 when the head is lowered. Race also has kind words for the pig for use in experimental procedures. Al- though it's been overlooked because of its large size, he says, the pig is closer to humans than the mice, rats, guinea pigs, hamsters, and rabbits generally favored in the lab. Indeed, in some systems, no- tably the skin, pigs may even be closer to humans than the phylogenetically higher species, i.e., nonhuman primates. Race says miniature pigs are now being bred for research purposes, and adds that the full-size animals, precisely because of their size, are useful in the development of new operative techniques in cardio- vascular and transplant surgery. For certain procedures, only primates come close enough to man to make the results relevant. In the testing of polio vaccine, for example, rhesus monkeys are used not only because they are speci- fied in FDA regulations, but because they are the only species in which U.S. tests are shown to be valid, according to James Vickers of the Bureau of Biolog- ics. "The only animals that are suscep- tible to the polio organism are primates," he says. In other procedures, higher life forms are the wrong choice. In aging re- search, for example, the length of time it takes for many mammals to age drives up the cost and time of experiments to prohibitive levels. ILAR is studying the available animal models to determine the appropriate strains of mice (which age in 2 or 3 years) and other fast-aging orga- nisms for use in particular aging studies. The matter of choosing an animal ap- propriate to the experiment is a complex one, and scientists and animal welfare groups continue to talk at cross-purposes on the issue. Animal welfare groups tend to insist that the fewest number of the lowest species be used in all experi- ments. But sometimes fewest, or lowest, isn't best. "If the experimental results aren't relevant to humans and you have to conduct the research again on higher animals, then you've wasted all those an- imals," says Wolfle. If redundant back- ground work is performed to provide a data base for one species even though there's a wealth of background informa- tion available on another, higher species, then there is also a waste of animals. And if the least possible number of ani- mals is used and the results end up being statistically insignificant, the re- search will have to be repeated; those animals, too, will have been wasted. To avoid false economies and improp- er species selection, the National Li- brary of Medicine recently established a Laboratory Animal Data Bank to pro- vide investigators with information needed to choose correctly. Animals are grouped according to strain, source, en- vironmental factors, husbandry practice, and test methods, and such details as the pathogens to which each strain is suscep- tible are provided. Animals for Teaching One use of higher organisms to which humanitarians object most strenuously involves the use of vertebrates in the high school and undergraduate biology classroom and the high school science fair. "If you're going to harm or kill an animal, you've got to have jolly good jus- tification for doing so," says physiologist Barbara Orlans, president of the new Scientists' Center for Animal Welfare (of which ISAP's Fox is vice-president). And, she says, elementary training in bi- ology is not reason enough. Orlans, who for years has criticized what she sees as the abuse of animals in high school science fairs, comes head-to- head with NSMR's Grafton on this issue. "I've seen everything-some terrible abuses," she says. In the sixties, win- ning experiments involved monkey sur- gery done in the garage, rat surgery in the kitchen sink, the blinding of spar- rows, the boiling of cats. Last year's winner cut off the legs and tail of a lizard "to demonstrate a perfectly well-known fact, that the tail would regenerate and the legs wouldn't. Did we need a high school student to show us this? That's not biomedical research; that's absolute nonsense." Grafton, who chairs the animal care committee of the International Science and Engineering Fair, says the experi- ments satisfy students' scientific curios- ity and teach them skills that will serve them well in later training and research. Orlans says the students learn little, con- tribute nothing, and are encouraged to become just the kind of scientists society doesn't want. Orlans much prefers the approach taken in Canada, where high school sci- ence fair projects cannot involve verte- brates at all except for observation in ways that in no way affect their life course. The American Society for Phar- macological and Experimental Thera- peutics is, at Orlans' urging, about to consider adoption of new animal re- search guidelines based largely on Cana- da's. Orlans does not want an exclusion of all animals from the biology class- room; in fact, she would like to see more, not fewer, live organisms used as teaching aids. But, she points out, crude monkey surgery conducted on a highly stressed animal teaches nothing about pathology to a 15-year-old who doesn't even know the basic physiology of lower organisms, much less of primates. "My suggestion is to use the organism on the lowest phylogenetic level commen- surate with your [teaching] objective." Animals for Toxicity Tests No less controversial than the proper use of animals in science fairs and teach- ing is their use in toxicity tests con- ducted to satisfy, regulatory require- ments. Grafton sees this as a Catch-22 created by two liberal elements: con- sumer activists calling for "zero risk" to the public health and animal rights activ- ists asking that no experiment be done on animals for nonessential reasons. An- imal testing for each new compound in- troduced on the market costs about $500,000 and involves hundreds of ani- mals. People on both sides of the animal welfare debate are beginning to ask whether it's worth the animals and money involved to test luxury items and non- essential "me-too" drugs and pesticides. Part of the reason for this questioning is concern over whether test results are even relevant to human health and pub- lic safety. The Lethal Dose 50 (LD-50) test has felt the most heat recently, since its end- point is death for one-half the animals being tested, and death is often protract- ed and painful. Some arguments for and against the controversial test are enu- merated in the recent book, Alternatives to Animal Experiments, written by D.H. Smyth for the Research Defense So- ciety, Britain's counterpart to NSMR. The LD-50, goes the con argument, misses less-than-lethal toxicologic ef- fects; tests quantities of the compound that are far larger, proportionately, than those that humans would use; is of ques- tionable relevance to humans because of species variation; yields imprecise infor- mation due to differences in routes and March 1979 147</page><page sequence="4">conditions of administration of the com- pound from one test to the next; and is far less cost-effective, in terms of trained manpower, than would be the close ob- servation for pathological changes in a few animals. The argument in favor of LD-50, as de- scribed by Smyth, is that it is required by regulation before a new product is in- troduced; best expresses the general tox- icity of a compound; is needed for deriv- ing a standardized safety margin for new drugs known as the Therapeutic Dose In- dex (the ratio of the LD-50 to the Ef- fective Dose 50, the lowest dose at which a drug's beneficial effects are noted in half the animals); limits the number of animals needed on longer-term chronic toxicity tests; yields useful information as the animals are observed during the LD-50 test, and as survivors are ob- served for long-term toxic effects; spares at least half the animals under study, all of which would be sacrificed if the test had been for acute toxicity; and allows for the use of fewer animals to achieve statistical significance than would be needed in, for example, an LD-5 test. Many people, unconvinced by these arguments, remain critics of the LD-50 test. At the minimum, they say, efforts should be made to screen compounds for animal testing using other means. At best, a battery of tests could be designed that would eliminate the need for animal toxicity tests altogether. Seeking Alternatives to Animals Advocates of "alternatives to ani- mals" tend to realize that animals will probably be needed to some degree in basic research conducted to answer questions about living things. But they believe a significant reduction in the numbers of animals used, and the num- ber of experiments involving animals (now estimated at more than 60% of all biomedical research supported by NIH), can be achieved through exploitation of other methods. Among the alternatives investigated in Smyth's book are tissue culture, mechanical models and dum- mies, in vitro techniques, mathematical and electrical models (including comput- ers), gas chromatography and other re- fined analytical techniques, radioimmu- noassay, isotopes, and plants and lower organisms. Some common-sense regulatory changes might lessen the need for ani- mals as well, says Christine Stevens, a trustee of the Scientists' Center for Ani- mal Welfare and president of the Animal Welfare Institute (AWI). Founded by Stevens and her husband in 1951, AWI is the granddaddy of animal welfare groups, and its message usually reveals the pro-research orientation of its seven- member scientific board. A recent AWI policy statement addressed the question of animal toxicity tests with this sugges- tion: "Where obviously harmful effects can be predicted by the chemical or physical properties of a new product, for example a strong acid, it should be auto- matically given a warning label without requiring further animal testing." In cas- es where the potential danger is un- known, AWI urges reliance on as few an- imals as possible; where the danger is likely to be minimal, as in tests of new soaps or cosmetics, the group says that safe and painless human testing, such as skin patch tests, should be substituted for animal tests. Research on human volunteers can, in some instances, be more ethical than re- search involving animals, say some hu- manitarians. Not only are the experi- ments often safer to the subjects, they say, but they are more directly appli- cable to questions of human health, en- countering none of the doubts about in- terspecies reliability that often plague animal test results. And, they add, only humans can provide true informed con- sent; in fact, some persons get a feeling of satisfaction in taking a personal risk for the sake of mankind. ISAP's Michael Fox goes so far as to say that it is more ethical to go first to subnormal humans, such as severely re- tarded or comatose individuals, before using animals, since the humans in this case are the less sentient. He realizes this is an inflammatory proposal, but stands behind it even when given the chance to back down: "I would vote in favor of a normal, young, healthy chim- panzee over my daughter if her brain had been smashed in an auto accident." Few of Fox's allies would go this far. They point out that brain-damaged or re- tarded humans are not normal, and thus the information they would provide might actually prove less relevant to hu- man health than would experimental data from normal subjects from other species. Thurmon Grafton, reflecting NSMR's orientation toward poring over and protesting any regulation of scien- tific inquiry, points out that institutional review boards for research on human subjects currently require, as stated in HEW regulations, that "appropriate ani- mal work" be conducted before research is done on man; thus, the net result of Fox's proposal would not save animals in the long run. Regulating Use of Animals Although NSMR often is cast as the adversary of animal welfare activists, Grafton emphasizes that humane treat- ment of experimental animals is the goal of his group as well. "In an area as con- troversial as this, it doesn't make sense to air your dirty linen in public," he says. When he learns of an investigator who has abused animals, he says he "will bring to bear a lot of peer pres- sure" through an old-boy network of some 20,000 scientists, administrators, and university presidents--people who can be urged to make the research abuses stop before the animal welfare people find out. The scientific community, Grafton adds, "has been terribly inept at its own PR" by failing to emphasize the "public benefit" that results from animal re- search, thus "leaving itself vulnerable" to attack from animal rights activists. In the debate, he worries that one essential point gets lost: "The use of animals in research is not for the entertainment or personal gratification or self-interest of the scientist, but for the improvement of the quality of life of mankind." Not only have NSMR and Britain's Research Defense Society changed tac- tics recently, so has the most prestigious of U.S. research institutions, NIH. The federal agency went to Capitol Hill arm- in-arm with NSMR in the early sixties to battle animal welfare bills, but its 1978 revision of its own animal welfare policy includes many of those bills' stipula- tions. Charging NIH staff, advisory groups, and peer review groups "with the responsibility to consider the animal welfare policies and principles in their review of all applications," NIH's new guidelines for the use of live vertebrate animals-and the procurement of tissues from living animals-please many animal welfare groups. Among the stipulations put forth in the NIH policy: * A qualified biologist, behavioral sci- entist, or physician must perform or im- mediately supervise all such research. * A veterinarian "or other scientist competent in such matters" must super- vise housing, care, and feeding arrange- ments. * The research should be designed "to yield fruitful results for the good of so- Continued on p. 195 148 BioScience Vol. 29 No. 3</page><page sequence="5">ment for basic research because the pay- off is long-term and uncertain. Unhap- pily, there are stong business influences in the universities, as well as the land- grant colleges. That's where Earl Butz came from. Q I have one last question, Senator, m about OTA. Do you have any feel- ings about its first few years, how well it's functioning, and how its future looks? A Well, you know I'm one of the m newest -members of the OTA board. I came on shortly after Russ Pe- terson came on [as OTA director in Janu- ary 1978]. It's gotten off to a very shaky start, but I really do have the feeling now, with Peterson on the board, that it's settling down. Its charter is not en- tirely clear. It was drawn rather narrow- ly, and causes us some uncertainty. We haven't resolved finally to what extent we should look at assessing military technologies, and to what extent we can go beyond assessment strictly speaking and try to figure out what kind of new technologies this rapidly changing world requires. I think waiting for a new tech- nology to be developed and then to try to assess the impact is a backward way of going about it. We ought to be looking at the world and trying to figure out what kind of technologies are needed to im- prove it. Having identified them, I'd go even farther to help, with industry-uni- versity-government cooperation, to de- velop them. Q Is that the intent behind CEQ's 0 "Global 2000" project? They're doing some sort of enormous view of what the country will be like in the year 2000. A Well, I don't know about that, but Am I'm skeptical, especially if it's done by CEQ. The theoreticians are not the best prognosticators. I'd give that job to the historians. Q Would you rather see OTA moving * in that prospective direction? A Oh, very much so. We also have a * bill in to create an independent foundation that would help develop and transfer technologies for the develop- ment of the lesser-developed countries. Sweden and Canada have similar foun- dations. The administration's proposing one, but they're preoccupied with reor- ganization so they don't want to have more agencies than there were before they came in. They don't want any kind of agency; they want to roll it into a new IDCA [International Development Co- operation Administration], which would emasculate it, destroy its credibility be- fore it was even established. I think part of that job is, in partnership with lesser developed countries, to figure out what they need, instead of taking this patron- izing American notion of "Well, we're going to give you our technologies that are appropriate to your requirements." The developing nations ought to be in- volved directly in determining what's necessary or appropriate; we might find that what's appropriate for them ends up being very appropriate for us, too. That involves looking into the future. It also involves facing the present, the realities the world is up against. Is the problem now one of looking Sfor an appropriate mission [for OTA]? A I think that's part of it. It hasn't A been a serious problem yet, but if we want to utilize [OTA] to the fullest we're going to have to take some liber- ties with our charter. The competence of the staff, in my own mind, is unsure; I want to see more of their work product. I see efforts being made that are very healthy, bringing people in from outside, from different disciplines, to expose that staff to reality. If we take it out of the test tube, I think we can be very helpful. And that is happening. I'm not sure whether it was happening in the beginning, but in the Commerce Committee, at least, we go to OTA. We haven't gotten many products back yet; we haven't gotten any. But that's not a complaint; it's just too soon. Qa What are you asking them for? A. Well, we've got one on space, m which will develop in stages and will help us, we hope, develop a space policy for the future. And we have one on industrial innovation. I guess one thing that could happen a with OTA is that Congress uses it to say, "Here, you answer our impossible questions." A Yes. Then the final test is, having A gotten the answer, good or bad, seeing what Congress does with it.... Have you done any work on patent Q policy? A ... I don't know where I come A out on that issue. It's obvious that the present policy isn't working satisfac- torily, but I'm a little uncomfortable with the suggestion that all fruits of the gov- ernment's investment should go over to the private sector. On the other hand, if you reserve it for the government, nobody gets it, and the inventions aren't forthcoming. I am convinced something needs to be done, but I don't know what. We will be in a position to go into it, hear testimony, and to make suggestions. --Robin Marantz Henig March 1979 195</page><page sequence="6">ficient information to give consideration to humane treatment of research ani- mals, as was required. Of the 575 applications in the 1976 sample (397 from NSF, 178 from ADAMHA), 75% explicitly defended the animal model approach, 65% explored the possibility of alternative approaches, and only 42% argued applicability of the work in terms of usefulness to human health. The methodology described in the ap- plications, says ISAP, fell short of de- scriptions required to adhere to federal guidelines. Although virtually all investi- gators bowed to the boilerplate require- ments-submitting a review of the litera- ture, statement of objectives, step-wise experimental methodology, and argu- ments for the need for research in light of earlier work-they scored poorly on de- scriptions of the actual care of animals before, during, and after the experiment. Fewer than 10% of the applicants for whom the question was relevant an- swered "yes" to such questions as: Are exercise needs of the animals consid- ered? Is an argument made for isolation housing if it is to be used? Are there ade- quate facilities for waste disposal? Are lab personnel instructed in the least stressful procedures? Does the protocol stipulate postsurgical observation? Does the investigator provide assurance that only dead animals will be disposed of? In just 13% of the proposals did hous- ing conform to the ILAR space guide- lines. In just 13% did methods of euthanasia conform to ILAR specifica- tions. Where curare drugs were used, just 7% of investigators stated an in- tention to administer anesthesia, which is required under the Animal Welfare Act. And in only 13% of the applications was the lack of a painkiller explained. One-quarter of the applicants failed to a . . And the Winner Is ... Harvard has the nation's best biology de- partment-or so say other biologists. According to social scientists Everett C. Ladd, Jr. and Seymour Martin Lipsett, that school was named more often than any other by biology professors asked to "name the five departments nationally in your discipline that have the most distin- guished faculties." Fifty-four percent mentioned Harvard in the top five: 33% mentioned University of California (Berke- ley); 31%, University of Wisconsin (Mad- ison); 30%, Stanford: and 19M each for Yale and University of Michigan. In their report of a survey of 4,000 pro- fessors in 19 disciplines distributed in 1977, Ladd and Lipsett listed all schools rated in the top five by at least 10% of their peers. In the case of biology (see chart), this brought the listing to 12 schools, all of them among the nation's best-known universities. Most of the schools named as having the best biology departments were also ranked high by faculty members in at least two or three other disciplines. Stanford and Berkeley, for example, were mentioned in the top five by at least 10% of the professors polled in 17 disciplines; Harvard made the list in 16 fields, and the University of Michigan in 15. In medicine, Harvard was best hands- down: 65% of medical school faculties listed Harvard in their top five. Also ranked high were Stanford, chosen by 34% of those polled; Yale, 29%; Johns Hopkins, 24%; University of California (Los Angeles), 22%; Columbia, 22%; and Washington University (St. Louis), 21%. Among the other disciplines tapped were agriculture and forestry, in which Cornell was ranked high by 42% of those responding, followed by Wisconsin, 38%; Iowa State, 36%; Michigan State, 31%; and Purdue, 30%. Harvard pulled in the most votes for chemistry, MIT for engineering, and Berkeley for both math- ematics and physics.

Rockefeller U. 10 1 take into account the animals' dietary re- quirements or the optimum assignments of animals per cage. Just 13% considered the need for noise control or for the sepa- ration of incompatible animals; in just 19% was a veterinarian said to be on call around the clock. Failure to state so explicitly on the grant application does not, of course, mean that investigators aren't looking out for the welfare of research animals. But more and more efforts are being made today to impose regulatory and legislative safeguards just to make sure. Not only are federal grantees required to conform to the guidelines of their institu- tion or the American Association for Ac- creditation of Laboratory Animal Care, but congressmen have introduced a se- ries of bills to extend such protection to the private sector as well. The most re- cent such bill was introduced on 15 Janu- ary by Rep. Robert Drinan (D-Mass.), authorizing $12 million for development of research and testing methods that "minimize the use of, and pain and suf- fering to, live animals." The bill is a re- working of one Drinan introduced last year, which died a quiet death in the House science subcommittee without even a hearing record to note its passing. There's an obvious political appeal to such legislation: Constituents love ani- mals. They sent more letters to Congress when the Laboratory Animals Welfare Act was pending in 1966 than they had on any other topic until then, including civil rights and the Vietnam war. The Department of Defense received more letters protesting its use of beagles in poison gas tests, when it was revealed in 1973, than it had received protesting the bombing of Hanoi and Cambodia. More letters pored in to Life magazine about its 1966 photo essay on the abuse of dogs by dealers than on any other article in the magazine's history. "These bills all make points with the animal lovers back home, but they never come up for hearings," observes Graf- ton. He says legislators' lack of real in- terest in animal welfare is evidenced by the small authorizations they attach to the bills, such as $ 10 million for a nation- al commission on the humane treatment of animals, proposed last year by Rep. Fred Richmond (D-N.Y.). "That's a drop in the bucket compared to the NIH budget," Grafton says. He adds that NSMR is supporting these efforts any- way, since they constitute "more money for research" at a time when such money is tight. --Robin Marantz Henig 196 BioScience Vol. 29 No. 3</page></plain_text>
