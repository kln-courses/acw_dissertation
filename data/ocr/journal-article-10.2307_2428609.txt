XXXIII, No. 3 20 JUNE, I934 THE NATURE AND ORIGIN OF THE STIGMA A CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS A NEW MORPHOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF THE ANGIOSPERM FLOWER BY H. HAMSHAW THOMAS (With I5 figures in the text) HISTORY shows that in most branches of science generalisations which formerly passed as fundamental laws of nature have had to give place to very different and generally more complex concepts as the result of long-continued investigation. Gravitation, the gas laws and the concept of the atom are well-known examples of subjects in which the views of the earlier observers have been profoundly modi- fied. It is strange therefore that in the field of plant morphology the concepts which Goethe put forward in I790 remain to-day the basis of the morphological interpretation of the flower. This is still more remarkable since Goethe's views were wholly subjective or idealistic generalisations, and subsequent to their inception botanical thought has been revolutionised by the doctrine of evolution, while a very considerable store of information about ancient plants has been amassed by the palaeobotanists. It may be that during the last seventy years students of plant form have been so busy discovering and describing that they have had little time or inclination to reflect on the significance of their discoveries in relation to fundamental concepts, while recently the study of function has become more attractive than the study of form. We owe a considerable debt to Miss E. R. Saunders for reopening the subject of carpel morphology, and for showing that in many plants the vascular anatomy is not entirely consonant with the classical theory. Whether we agree with her interpretation of the facts or not, it is clear that no real progress can be made in morphology without a thorough discussion of the issues involved. PHYT. XXXIII. 3</page><page sequence="2">I74 H. HAMSHAW THOMAS THE FOUNDATIONS OF A SYSTEM OF MORPHOLOGY In a recent address (25) I have tried to indicate the reasons why it is necessary to-day to examine carefully the whole structure of our morphological system, and more especially its foundations. Such an examination shows that our ideas of the significance of floral structure, and, consequently, all modern systems of taxonomy, rest on one fundamental proposition, viz. that the different parts of the flower represent modified foliage leaves. The corollaries to this are: (I) That the flower is a modified vegetative bud, and therefore the most primitive floral type is that which most nearly resembles a vegetative bud. The hypogynous flower is consequently held to be more primitive than the perigynous flower, and the spiral arrange- ment of parts is considered more primitive than the whorled arrange- ment. Further, that all the floral parts are referable to an original and continuous spiral sequence even though they now show no traces of such a regular sequence in their ontogeny'. (2) That the most primitive carpel type is that which in its mature condition most closely resembles an infolded vegetative leaf, viz. the young follicle, consequently that the pluriovulate condition and the terminal stigma preceded forms with one or few ovules and those in which the stigma is not apical. (3) That no carpel or group of carpels can be regarded as primi- tively terminating the apex of the flower. As has been already pointed out, the grounds for this view and therefore for its corollaries are very unsubstantial and obtain little or no support from the study of either fossil plants or of the flowerless plants, while the developmental work of Prof. Gregoire (9) shows that there are essential differences between the development of the flower and of the vegetative bud. It thus becomes necessary either to produce fresh fundamental evidence or to set aside these theories, with all that was derived from them, as assumptions which cannot be proved, and to endeavour to build up a new system. It may be that some, if not all, of the old canons of floral morphology will eventually prove to be 1 The consequences of such an assumption are illustrated in a recent con- tribution to the discussion of carpel morphology(28). In this paper Prof. McLean Thompson assumes a spiral succession of the structures we are ac- customed to call the placentae of the carpels. The two placentae of one carpel, on this reasoning, are separated by an angular divergence of more than 360?, although in several of his contour drawings they appear to arise in equal pairs. The evidence for such an argument needs, however, a very full demonstration, and the mere numbering of primordia in diagrams affords a poor foundation for a far-reaching theory.</page><page sequence="3">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma I75 well founded, but, if so, they must be based on arguments differing radically from those which have been hitherto advanced. At the outset we must do our utmost to avoid a subjective out- look, the relationships of the parts of different flowers must be viewed from the standpoint of their possible evolutionary origin and not merely as parts of a mental scheme'. It is thus impossible to disso- ciatfe floral morphology from phylogeny, in spite of what may be urged to the contrary. The fact that in the past phylogenetic speculations have proved worthless may be evidence for the falsity of the morpho- logical ideas on which they were based, rather than against the phyletic outlook. In the second place we must consider the floral organs as inter- dependent parts of a whole living plant, whose reproduction depends on their efficiency. Any system of morphology should comply with two essential requirements: A. The postulates on which it is based should be exposed, so that their solidity may be at any time tested and assessed. At the present time no extensive generalisation on form and structure can be reached without taking much as reasonably probable though unprovable. It is hoped that future study will transform some of the necessary postulates into theorems based on evidence. The chief postulates of the new morphologist may be stated as follows. Let it be granted that: (I) Vascular plants have evolved from simple ancestors by pro- cesses similar to those disclosed by modern investigators of genetics, and that the general structural features of the plant are inherited characters. (2) The earliest differentiation of ancestral forms was that of reproductive from somatic cells. (3) While non-adaptational mutations may arise and persist, 1 It may be argued that there is little difference in practice between a subjective and an objective approach, but this is not true. The subjective treatment of morphology regards form as an intuitively apprehended concept (cf. Mrs Arber's recent characterisation(l) of the work of Prof. Troll), and consequently considerations of physiology and phylogeny have no practical significance. Crudely stated, the Caltha carpel is regarded as a folded leaf be- cause it looks like one. The objective attitude takes the material of which the plant is built, and considers it in relation to the processes going on within it and to its environment. The psychological apprehension of form has no value or meaning comparable to the synthesis of evidence derived from other diverse sources. It may possess value if supported by such evidence, but must always be regarded with suspicion owing to the risk of an anthropomorphic inter- pretation. I2-2</page><page sequence="4">I76 H. HAMSHAW THOMAS those structural or physiological mutations which are advantageous to the race will tend to be selected. These postulates are doubtless open to criticism but will be allowed by most botanists. There seem to be, however, differences of opinion as to the extent to which floral structures depend on hereditary characters. It has been stated that "the period of time over which each phase of flowering is spread, the rate of growth, and the form, stature and state of nutrition of the receptacle at each phase, will determine the number, form, stature and distribu- tion of the emergences on the receptacle, and what occurs within them " ((28), p. 67). The same author says later (p. iIo): " Each form of flower is accepted as an individual expression of the problem of flowering, and the number, form, disposition and state of each emergence are held to follow the dictates of the problem." If these statements have any objective meaning, they seem to imply the belittlement of hereditary characters. We have now to make another postulate which is more speculative. (4) All known vascular plants have arisen from the same or similar ancestral stocks, have developed under comparable habitat conditions, and have a physical constitution which is essentially similar. Consequently a uniform system of morphological concepts should be applicable to all vascular plants. This debatable idea is basal for the "New Morphology." It is derived from the observation that all vascular plants are built up from the same basic type of cell, with cellulose walls, a vacuolated protoplasmic lining, a nucleus of a definite character, chloroplasts and a comparable physiological mechanism. The living parenchyma, xylem elements, stomata, cuticle, etc., seem to be essentially similar in all green plants of the higher ranks, and it there- fore seems reasonable to suppose that organic forms which have appeared in one group might at some time have appeared or be likely to appear in another widely separated group. The older morpho- logists attempted to apply the principles of Angiosperm form to the elucidation of the Pteridophyta, but some recent authors say that arguments founded on one group of plants are not applicable to an unrelated group. The present writer, however, maintains that the types of evolutionary change which seem on good evidence to have taken place in a group such as the ferns, may be expected to have occurred in the ancestral history of the Angiosperms. An analogy may illustrate the argument: the forms and structures of all steel bridges may be held to be comparable, and to be capable of arrange-</page><page sequence="5">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma 177 ment in one or more evolutionary series because their form is ulti- mately conditioned by the properties of the material from which they are built; stone bridges form a distinct series not really comparable. So the vascular plants are held to be comparable with each other, but not with the Fungi. The analogy reminds us that it is obviously im- possible to describe or explain the structure of a simple plant in terrhs of a complex and more highly evolved form, and so consider- able caution must be exercised. But it is doubtful whether there is any fundamental difference between using structures found in one group of Angiosperms to explain the structures seen in another group, and explaining angiospermic structures by reference to ferns or fossil plants such as the Caytoniales. B. The second essential for a morphological system is that it must be applicable to all the known facts of structure and development. Structural features may vary in plasticity and importance, but none of them can be ruled out as possessing no morphological significance. The classical morphologists were concerned only with the external forms of mature organs, and with abnormalities, but in considering the carpel we have to consider the following features: (I) The ontogenetic development of carpels; the structure of the primordia and their subsequent changes. (2) The external forms of mature carpels (or ovary). (3) The vascular system of the carpels and its relation to the vascular supply of the floral axis. (4) The position, form and structure of the stigma and style. (5) The structure and arrangement of the transmitting (pollen- tube conducting) tissue. The path of the pollen tube. (6) Abnormalities. (7) The results of hybridisation and experimental culture. (8) The forms and positions of the ovules. (g) The evidence from fossil plants. Our aim should be the formulation of a scheme representing the possible evolution of the carpel which is in accord with the facts derived from an enquiry into each of the above-mentioned subjects, and at the same time is satisfactory from the standpoint of plant physiology. Just as the physicist or physiologist tries to explain his observed data by making certain assumptions, working out theoretical results of the assumptions, and comparing the results with his ob- served data, so the morphologist should attempt to sketch out a picture of a possible evolutionary series of changes, whose earlier stages would fit in with our available fossil evidence, and whose later</page><page sequence="6">I78 H. HAMSHAW THOMAS phases would agree in all respects with the different carpels which exist to-day. In a previous paper I suggested a provisional picture of carpel evolution based on the Caytoniales and showed how this might elucidate certain peculiarities of the vascular system as well as the occurrence of forking stigmas and anatropous ovules (24). This picture was a first approximation and was criticised, probably with justice, on the ground that the suggested mode of evolution of the stigma was unintelligible(29). In consequence the stigmas of many flowering plants have been studied in order to form a truer appreciation of their structure and of the path taken by the pollen tubes. The recent detailed examination of a new group of Pteridosperms from the Southern Hemisphere(26) has contributed to our knowledge of some of the Gymnosperms which existed just before the appearance of the first known Angiosperms, while the work of Dr T. M. Harris (12) has provided the first real link between angiospermy and gymnospermy. It is thus possible to present a second approximation, and to deal especially with the origin of the stigma and style. If the view here elaborated is correct we have but a short step now missing in the complete transition from the cupule-bearing branches of the Pteri- dosperms to the carpel of the flowering plant as indicated by actual historical evidence. THE ORIGIN OF THE STIGMA FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CLASSICAL THEORY It seems natural to commence by assuming the truth of the view which we have inherited from our ancestors and which regards the carpel as derived by the infolding of a leaf bearing marginal ovules. If we adopt the objective attitude and think out the possible ways in which the carpel may have evolved from some such gymnospermous structure we are at once confronted with the problem of how, when and why did the stigma arise. Most botanists have carefully avoided these questions, but there are clearly three different ways in which the stigma might have appeared: (i) We may suppose that the appearance of a glandular structure, later the stigma, at the tip of the supposed fertile leaf was the first step towards the closure of the carpel. The pollen grains might have germinated on this structure and the pollen tubes have miraculously found their way to the ovules, which presumably turned round and became anatropous. When the ovules were being fertilised habitually in this way the closure of the carpel could and did commence (27). Now</page><page sequence="7">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma 179 even if a glandular tip appeared on a megasporophyll and the pollen germinated on it, would it be physiologically possible for the pollen tubes to reach the ovules? If they grew over the open surface of the fertile leaf, which must have been fully exposed according to this view, they would surely become desiccated before they reached their goal. If they grew through the internal tissues, how did they find their way to the ovules? (2) The second way would be the inrolling of the leaf margins before the evolution of pollination through the medium of a stigma. This would meet the objection of the probable desiccation of the pollen tube, but it involves a more serious difficulty. The initiation of an inrolling process before the formation of the stigma would bring about the sterilisation of a number of the ovules by screening them from the pollen grains, consequently a mutation in this direction would be liable to early extermination. (3) While it seems rather unlikely that the appearance of the stigma and the inrolling of the leaf would occur simultaneously in a single mutation, there is the possibility that the closure of the leaf was preceded by the development of a marginal band of secretory cells spreading round the funicles of the ovules from the base to the apex of the carpellary leaves. The pollen grains may have begun to ger- minate on this and to fertilise the ovules in a chalazogamic manner. Once this process had been established the leaf might commence to close and the pollen tubes would have to grow farther and farther from their point of arrival in order to reach the ovules. This suggestion is much more in accord with the structural facts mentioned below, but it provides only a partial explanation of the varied features of carpel structure mentioned above, and is opposed by Gregoire's observations on the form of the carpel primordia. On the whole, and apart from any morphological conclusions as to the evolutionary nature of the foliage leaf and the fertile branches, I think that the theory of the rolled leaf is too naive and must be dis- carded unless at last some definite piece of evidence can be brought forward in its favour. The interpretation of the carpel on the principles of the "New Morphology " discards entirely the classical concept of the fertile leaf; we no longer regard the young follicle as the primitive type. The whole carpel is deemed to have originated from a branched structure by evolutionary stages totally different from those passed by the foliage leaf, though both structures are regarded as originally derived from specialised branches of the thallus. The ovules are held to represent</page><page sequence="8">i8o H. HAMSHAW THOMAS original terminal structures, the placentae separate branches, and the carpel wall a cupular structure which is quite distinct in origin from a typical foliar structure. A new theory as to the origin of the stigma has been advanced recently ((28), p. Io8) which departs yet further from the classical view. The primitive flower is regarded as possessing only vegetative emer- gences, stamens and stalked ovules borne on a crater-like receptacle. " In time the stamens on the crater rim were diverted from fertility and were the forerunners of styles. Glandulation or stigmatism was a phenomenon of their diversion, and expressed itself, as to-day, and as in the modern styles, on their distal portions." This view appears to have little objective foundation, and in the absence of physiological or structural details about the structures in question it cannot now be usefully discussed. ON THE NATURE OF THE STIGMA OF LIVING PLANTS In reconsidering ab initio the problem of the stigma we must first ascertain the path of the pollen tubes in modern plants. English and German writers on carpel morphology say little on this subject, apart from a few cases in which the last stage of the journey is through the chalaza. But much information already exists, though further re- search is clearly needed'. Capus(6) in I878 investigated the paths of the pollen tubes in many flowers and demonstrated the presence of a specialised tract of tissue which conducts the tubes from the stigmatic surface to the placentae. He reached the conclusion that the stigma is only the upper termination of the so-called conducting tissue of the style; Dr Harris has suggested to me that it would be preferable to call this "transmitting tissue" in order to avoid confusion with the vascular elements. Capus found that this tissue generally extends down to the level of the lowest ovule. He stated that its formation commences by differentiation of the fundamental parenchyma in the ovary, and this differentiation later extends to the style and stigma. In many ovaries we find papillate cells like those of the stigma, while in each carpel two adjacent centres of formation of the transmitting tissue can generally be distinguished. In the style the papillate form of the cells is usually lost and they form a continuous parenchyma distinguishable by its specialised walls and contents; these cells sometimes show marked changes during their development, their walls swell, probably becoming gelatinous and later assuming the 1 A brief summary of the literature is given in Schnarf's " Embryologie der Angiospermen "(22), p. 282.</page><page sequence="9">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma i8i appearance of collenchyma, especially in the Compositae and other sympetalous families. Later Gueguen (10, 11) confirmed most of Capus' observations in an extensive systematic study of the apetalous and gamopetalous families, and in I9I8 the late Prof. Juel(14) recorded the distribution of this transmitting tissue in the chief genera of the Rosaceae. One would think that its occurrence and distribution would play an im- portant part in discussions on carpel morphology, but it has scarcely been mentioned in recent publications. From the work just described we seem justified in regarding the stigmatic surface as really a specialised part of the inner wall of the ovary which exhibits a very definite differentiation. This differentia- tion commences at the base of the ovary and extends upwards. In a number of apocarpous carpels of the Rosaceae and Ranunculaceae the specialised cells extend as a double band just inside of or along the ventral suture. When considered in relation to the growth of the pollen tube the differentiation of these cells cannot be regarded as a change initiated at the tip of the carpel and extending downwards, and in a number of cases, e.g. Tournefortia, Cotoneaster (see Fig. 9), the transmitting tissue passes by the top of the ovary and enters it only from the base. We can scarcely avoid the conclusion that the stigma originated on the ventral side of the carpel, perhaps nearer to the base of the ovary than to the apex, and that the subsequent development of the style, or of the ovary wall, has gradually carried it upwards.

HAMSHAW THOMAS subsequent authors, for Brown was at the height of his powers when this opinion was published, and he had given long and careful study to an immense variety of flowering plants. We may find evidence of the double nature of the stigma in the many flowers in which it or its lobes fork into two equal halves, while the so-called gynobasic styles furnish good examples of the basal or lateral position of the organ which are difficult to explain on con- ventional lines. The carpels of Drimys merit special attention, since this genus has been regarded as primitive on account of its vegetative structure. There is little doubt that the absence of vessels in the wood of V r Fig. 2z Fig. 3. Fig. 4. Figs. 2-4. Drimys Winteri Forst.

The form of the stigma in some of the Old World species (originally called Tasmannia) differs from that seen in the South American Drimys Winteri as shown in Figs. I-3. In D. piperita Hook. fil. and D. aromatica F. Muell. the stigma forms a double band of papillate cells extending along the whole of the adaxial side of the carpel from top to bottonr(see Figs. I} I3 D). In transverse sections of D. aromatica it closely resembles the structure shown in Fig. 4. The secondary veins in the carpel wall arise from the placental bundles below and from a pair of strong dorsal bundles in the upper part of the carpel. In D. Winteri the stigma is also a lateral double structure (Figs. 2-4). It is somewhat restricted in size, but as in the species mentioned</page><page sequence="11">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma I83 above it represents part of the margin, or rather the inner surface of the carpel wall. Transverse sections show that the delicate papillate cells which cover the stigmatic surface continue inwards through a central slit to the placentae within; this slit is the ventral suture and the carpel wall above and below the stigma is composed of perfectly uniform parenchymatous cells. All the ovules lie near the level of the stigma. The placental bundles are rather wide apart and in some specimens a slender branching vein lies between them (Fig. 2). The dorsal vein is here a single strand which curves over at the apex and gives off secondary veins into the carpel wall. The other members of the Magnoliales appear to have stigmas referable to the types seen in Drimys (cf. Fig. I3). In Schizandra there is an elongated papillate structure with a central groove running along the greater part of the ventral side. Trochodendron, which also possesses wood without vessels, is essentially similar but the stigmatic surfaces are limited to the apices of the carpels which form a partly fused whorl; although the receptive area does not extend far down the ventral side, a fissure lined with transmitting cells continues to the base as in D. aromatica. No suitable material of Illicium, Kadsura or Tetracentron has yet been available but published figures suggest their similarity. The elongated apical stigma of Magnolia appears at first sight distinct from the Drimys type but is certainly linked with it through Trochodendron and Schizandra. Juel's description and figures of the carpels of the chief genera of the Rosaceae at the time of fertilisation, with special reference to the structure of the stigma and style, the courses of the transmitting tissue and vascular bundles, the form and positions of the ovules, and the paths of the pollen tubes, provide the most complete evidence yet available (14). Although tied by the classical view of the carpel, Juel pointed out several features on which a totally different arrangement of the genera might be based by reference to the stigma and style. He was forced to exclude the Kerrioideae, which may now be held to be the most primitive forms, from his scheme of phyletic relation- ships; and, indeed, it is difficult to derive these forms from an ancestral type similar to the Quillajeae, though the reverse process is a simple conception. The stigma in the Rosaceae, with the exception of Alchemilla, shows a ventral groove lined with transmitting tissue which corre- sponds to the ventral suture below; during its passage down the style the transmitting tissue generally becomes enclosed in the centre and</page><page sequence="12">I84 H. HAmsHAw THOMAS ultimately spreads out again on the inner wall of the ovary and around the placentae, lining the inner sides of the ventral suture. But in several genera, e.g. Rhodotypus (Figs. 7, 7 a), Coleogyne (Figs. 5, 6), Comarum (Fig. 8), Cotoneaster (Fig. 9), Cerocarpus, Waldsteinia, Geum and Alchemilla, the transmitting tissue runs down to a point well below the top of the ovarian cavity before opening out, and in most of these cases Juel found the pollen tubes running down to the level I0 { 5a~~~~ 5a 8 67 Figs. 5, 5 a, 6.

In Coleo- gyne and Comarum (Figs. 6, 8) the styles are inserted laterally, and, as viewed in longitudinal section, appear as though the ovary wall had originated in ontogeny below the ovule, had curved round it, and, after completely enclosing it, had continued to grow upwards. In such forms as Rhodotypus and Cotoneaster there is no longer a gap between the dorsal side of the style and the ventral side of the ovary, and this ontogenetic fusion may have led to types like Dryas and</page><page sequence="13">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma i85 Waldsteinia, where the style appears to arise from the top of the ovary; elongation of an ovary of this type would give the Kageneckia type, which Juel thought the most primitive. The present distribution of the members of the Kerrioideae sug- gests an argument in favour of their antiquity. In this group Juel includes four monotypic genera, Rhodotypus confined to Japan, Kerria to China, Neviusia, an endemic in Alabama, and Coleogyne, a Californian endemic. Murbeck's studies(18) of the development of the carpel in Alche- milla showed that the carpel wall does actually grow in the way suggested above (Fig. io), spreading round the developing ovule in what may loosely be termed a circinate fashion and finally closing at the base of the style. A very cursory glance through botanical literature shows that the type of carpel development seen in Alchemilla is by no means ex- ceptional and may even prove to be the more general type. Payer's figures of Coriaria and Ailanthus reproduced in Goebel's Organography (8) are well known, and many other of his figures (20) seem to show similar features. Quite recently v the same mode of growth has been illustrated from Boerhaavia diffusa by Maheshwari (17) and B. repanda (Nyctagi- A naceae) by Bhargava ((4), see Fig. ii), and the figures of Lyonothamnus floribundus B given by Juliano (15) suggest the same Fig. iiA, B.

A SUGGESTED ORIGIN OF THE STIGMA The question now arises: Can these facts about the stigma, trans- mitting tissue, style and ovary wall be explained or fitted into a morphological scheme without any far-reaching assumptions? Fortunately we are now able to outline a possible history of the evolution of the carpel which would co-ordinate the varied facts of 1 E.g.

HAMSHAW THOMAS structure and combine them with what we know of fossil seed plants. One may call it a history rather than a phantasy because it com- mences with a group of plants which actually existed, and is based on the comparison of the plants of successive ages. Instead of having to postulate not only the structure of the supposed ancestral mega- sporophyll but also a series of evolutionary changes, we have only to grant that the study of the changes known to have occurred in a great group of plants which resulted in the production of the angio- spermous habit, may be useful in explaining the evolution of the flowering plants. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the flowering plants which have only been dominant in the world for a period of about one hundred million years were derived from the pteridosperms, which had previously existed all over the world for at least twice as long a period, if it can be shown that there is a possibility of deriving the fertile and vegetative structures of the former from those of the latter. The ovules of the Pteridospermae were essentially terminal structures more or less surrounded by a cupule and borne on a branching structure (Fig. I2 A-F). During the Palaeozoic period the ovule-bearing structures were often associated in various ways with photosynthetic fronds, but in the known Triassic members of the group (Fig. I2 D-F) no expanded lamina was present though minute bracts and bracteoles occurred on the branches. As compared with the Palaeozoic forms these fertile branches were very much reduced, the ovules were produced in pairs, and in several examples the cupules of the terminal pairs were more or less concrescent (Fig. iX F). The cupules had a recurved form, and in one genus the inside of the cupule was thickly lined with hairs. A little later, in the Liassic period, structures of a similar external form (Caytoniales, Fig. i2 G, H) passed from the gymnospermous to the angiospermous mode of fertilisation; instead of entering the micropyles the pollen germinated on the recurved tips of the hairy cupule and the ovary became closed. Here we see a lateral stigma which is part of the inner surface of the ovary wall. If we now assume that a similar process went on in the case of cupules which were concrescent, we should have a structure which is in all essentials an angiospermous carpel (Fig. I2 I, J). The original ovule-bearing stalks on this view would have now become the two adjacent placentae, the cupules growing from these stalks and curving over the ovules in three dimensions might have become completely fused except for their recurved papillate tips which form a</page><page sequence="15">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma I87 pair of lateral stigmatic surfaces, and since the whole structure is reduced from a much longer and more branched type, it seems possible that the concrescence of the cupules on the dorsal side might some- MESOZOIC PALAEOZOIC ABC Fig. 12.

HAMSHAW THOMAS the stigma should appear either towards the base of the carpel or in some other position along the ventral side (Fig. I3 A, D). It is likely that these ovulate structures were grouped together at the apex of a stem. But since the chances of fertilisation would be increased by the elongation of the stigma or its appearance at the top of the carpel, especially where the ovaries weie crowded together, mutations in the direction of style formation would probably be selected, and so we arrive at a type of structure represented not only among the Rosaceae, but also in Trochodendron, Magnolia and a number of plants of various families.

This upward growth of the stigma would leave a groove lined with the specialised cells which now form the transmitting tissue. The groove corresponds to the ventral suture, which in the Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae and Leguminosae often shows an actual slit at the base, as our theory would require. From this primitive carpel all the other forms can be very readily derived without great assumptions (see Figs. I3, I4). Concrescence or fusion of adjacent carpels gives the nor- mal type with axile placentation; the young follicle with its terminal stigma would come by elongation accompanied by reduction of the apical curvature. Ovaries with free central placentation mayhave been formed when the constituent carpels were so close together that it was</page><page sequence="17">The Nature and Origin of the Stzgma I89 impossible for the circinate cupules in closing over to come into contact with their respective placentae. I believe that this theory is worthy of serious consideration not only because it is possible from the physiological standpoint, but also because it explains most of the important features specified above and which classical morphologists have often ignored or glossed over. It not only agrees with the ontogenetic observations mentioned earlier but with the observations of Goebel ((8), Figs. 359, 364) that in the early stages of carpel development three centres of development may be distinguished. One may correspond to each placenta and one to the fused cupules. Gregoire(9) attaches considerable significance to the fact that the two placentae of the carpel are from the first Fig. 14. Diagrams indicating suggested relations between ovaries with central basal styles (? primitive type), those with axile placentae (left) and those with free central placentation (right). separated by a V-shaped slit and not by a U-shaped. depression, which would be required on the old view. Our suppositions would be in accord with his observations. They would also explain the obser- vations made on the Scitamineae(28). It is probably possible to account for the various external forms of ovaries on any theory, but the new views suggest that the different types now extant may be the results of variations in the rates of growth and concrescence of the original parts, accompanied by modi- fications of a less extensive character than that required by the classical views. Our postulated primitive structure is probably nearer than the young follicle of Caltha to the average type of modern carpel. The different forms of stigmas, especially the so-called com- missural stigmas, now seem readily explicable. The arguments with reference to the vascular system remain essentially the same as those PHYT. XXXIII. 3 I3</page><page sequence="18">I90 H. HAMSHAW THOMAS brought forward in my previous paper, and it may be noted that our new theory would lead us to expect the presence of the structures which Miss Saunders interprets as the fusion of 2 i, 2 carpels. It is necessary in view of recent criticism (1) to reiterate my view that the general pattern of the vascular system must at present be regarded as an hereditary character, for variations in the size and development of the ventral and dorsal strands have been observed to occur without greatly affecting the general pattern. Such different types of venation as those seen in Drimys and Caltha may be explicable on the view that the carpel wall is derived from fused cupules. I have not yet seen any phyletic explanation of the distribution of the transmitting tissue, and I hope that the investigation and dis- cussion of this important constituent of the carpel may be stimulated by the views suggested above. The possible significance of the ana- tropous ovule was referred to in I93I, and the argument still holds, although neither the Corystospermaceae nor the Caytoniales have been found to possess ovules which could be termed anatropous. It is to be hoped that future research may tell us more about the nature and significance of abnormalities, but the production of ab- normal open carpels described by Lamprecht in PisUM16) suggests possibilities in this direction. The fact that open leaf-like carpels may be produced by crossing may be taken to suggest that the abnorma- lities on which the classical morphologists have relied so much should not be regarded as reversions, but as new types of structure resulting from a rearrangement of genes. However, a large number of widely different types of abnormal carpels have been described, and it seems reasonable to regard plants as capable of varying in many directions owing to changes in the nuclear or physiological constitution of their meristems. The problem which confronts us is whether these structural variations arise at random, or whether they are related to the fundamental morpho- logical construction of the organ. Is it possible to conceive of all the different abnormal carpels as variations in every possible direction from one central type of structure? If so, while no single form might be truly atavistic, the whole series might have considerable morpho- logical value. It may be that the present concept of the carpel as originally composed of four or five distinct parts (two placentae and two cupules, sometimes accompanied by the relics of the stalk between the cupules), which may be fused or separated, hypertrophied or reduced in a number of different ways, provides such a central type of structure.</page><page sequence="19">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma I9I THE EVIDENCE FROM FOSSIL PLANTS Some authors deprecate the introduction into questions of Angiosperm morphology of ideas derived from the study of fossil plants. They have perhaps overlooked the significance of the fossil record in morphological studies. When we take a survey of a problem like that of the carpel, we find different authors commencing with different sets of basic assumptions; they examine one or two aspects of the modern structures and reach divergent conclusions, Each conclusion may be valid by reference to the assumptions and to the evidence employed, but how are we to decide which is nearest to the truth? The decision often rests with the student of fossil plants. Unless the Angiosperms were separately created, or evolved from distinct unicellular ancestors through forms of which we have no records, their history and morphology must be interpreted by reference to ancient plants. Few people realise how much we know of the development of plant form from the Devonian period to the present day. It is only the adherence to a discredited system of morphological concepts that transforms the fossil record into a mass of unconnected fragments of plant history. The view of the carpel outlined above not only seems to fit the facts derived from the study of modern plants but it also links on to the chronological series of fossil plants, which suggests that the changes indicated may have actually taken place, though the known fossils are to be regarded as successive members of a race rather than as a single genetic series'. As some of these fossils are not yet well known we may now add some further reference to them. Commencing with the well-known Upper Palaeozoic Lagenostoma Lomaxi (Fig. I2 A) we have a species with a very open and deeply divided cupule which had glandular hairs on its inside (19). Arber described another species, L. Sinclairi (2), in which the cupule was larger and more campanulate, only lobed near its margin (Fig. I2 B). In Gnetopsis (19) there were several seeds with long, micropylar structures completely surrounded by a two- valved cupule (Fig. Iz C), on the inside of which Oliver and Salisbury found hairs. Pilophorosperma(26), a form which probably had a wide distribution in the Southern Hemisphere in Triassic times, had single 1 Special attention must be drawn to the method by which the fossil forms are arranged in a phyletic series. The species mentioned show different organisa- tion levels, or stages in a series of changes. By the abstraction of the relevant characters it may be said that the Caytonia type of structure may be derived from the Lagenostoma type, though there is no reason to suppose that the genus Caytonia was derived from a Lagenostoma. I3-2</page><page sequence="20">I92 H. HAMSHAW THOMAS seeds enclosed in recurved cupules thickly lined with hairs (Fig. I2 D, E); some of the hairs were long while others were probably glandular. These cupules were usually produced in opposite pairs and were often borne on pedicels, though in certain species they were sessile. In P. geminatum the terminal pairs of sessile cupules were more or less fused (Fig. I2 F), while an example of another species shows that the cupules arose in close contact though separating later. It should be noted that all these objects were of small size. The mature cupules were less than 4 mm. across, while the whole branched structure, bearing perhaps eight cupules, was little more than 2 cm. long. They were true Gymnosperms, the curved micropyles projected from the cupules and probably absorbed the pollen grains by a drop mechanism. Dr Harris(12) has recently described a species from Greenland which is of the greatest morphological interest. It is the earliest known member of the Caytoniales and had an ovary which became closed at an early stage in its development leaving a flange which closely resembled a stigma. But the ovules in this form were un- doubtedly fertilised in a gymnospermous way, since in more than half of the many seeds examined a number of pollen grains were found in the micropyles. Dr Harris had reasons to suppose that the micro- pyles were at an early stage connected with the " stigmatic" opening by canals, and he suggested that the inside of the fruit wall was very thick and fleshy, embedding the seeds in pockets and nearly obliterat- ing the cavity of the ovary. After studying the Corystospermaceae it seems reasonable to suggest that the tissue in which the seeds were embedded may have been composed of a mass of more or less fleshy hairs, growing from the ovary wall, and perhaps forming a pseudo- parenchymatous tissue, something like the flesh of the orange. There can be little doubt that these plants which Harris calls Caytonia thomasi are closely related to the Yorkshire members of the Caytoni- ales, though the propriety of including them in the genus Caytonia is debatable'. The mode of fertilisation of this new species naturally raises the question as to whether Caytonia Sewardi and Gristhorpia Nathorsti from the Jurassic(23) were really angiospermous after all, but there can be little doubt on this point. Before these forms were described more than I50 seeds were macerated and studied by the same method 1 The difficulty is one, familiar to palaeontologists, of deciding on the best nomenclature for an early ancestral form and two later types probably derived from it.</page><page sequence="21">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma I93 used for the Greenland forms. A pollen grain occurred in one seed only, and since this was a mature seed lying free -in a matrix full of similar microspores no significance could be attached to it. In com- plete fruits pollen grains were only found on the young stigmas, and these stigmas represented a recurved portion of the ovary wall, thickly lined with papillae on its inner side, and precisely similar in form and structure (so far as it is observable) to one of the stigmatic flaps of Drimys (see Fig. I5). No doubt the ovary of these Jurassic forms was open at a very early stage in its development just as in the Fig. I5.

Part of one of the seeds is shown. x IO9. case of the carpel, but it must have become closed up very soon by the growth of the papillate hairs of the stigmatic surface. It may be mentioned here that Prof. John Walton has recently discovered a very young leaf of Sagenopteris which, owing to its hook-like form, not unlike that of young leaves of Vicia faba, pro- vides a further reason for regarding this type as allied to the Angio- sperms rather than to the ferns. The study of the Corystospermaceae and the Caytoniales has not yet provided any definite information upon the question of the aggregation of seed-bearing structures to give what we call a flower. The consideration of this subject must be deferred pending the collection of further facts and the study of newly acquired fossil</page><page sequence="22">I94 H. HAmsHAw THOMAS evidence. It may be noticed, however, that there is good evidence from all groups of the seed plants of a tendency for the fertile parts of the plants to become aggregated together in compact clusters at the tips of the ultimate branches. There is thus no reason why the value of the fossil forms just mentioned should be discounted on the ground that they did not bear flowers. Although the Caytoniales probably overlapped the flowering plants in point of time, we have yet no certain evidence from periods before the Upper Cretaceous on which we can base any opinions with reference to the forms of carpels and stigmas in the earliest flowers. Hitherto no attempt has been made to deduce the probable characters of the more primitive types from the study of Cretaceous and Early Tertiary angiosperms, for it has been generally agreed that such forms had already become highly specialised, and could in no sense be regarded as primitive. We must notice, however, that this opinion is a further consequence of the classical views of morphology. It is only a preconception of the nature of the primitive flower which has led botanists to hold that the flora which existed some ninety million years ago was as highly evolved as that of the present day. It is very probable that the " primitive flowers " for which we have searched in vain so long, and whose discovery had to be awaited for the solution of all the problems of angiosperm morphology and phylogeny, are chimeras of the imagination. We can find no traces of them because they have never existed. If we set aside the classical theory as discredited, and concede that different groups of Angiosperms may have arisen along parallel lines from distinct groups of pteridosperms, we may come to regard the Upper Cretaceous and Eocene floras in quite a different light. Why should we not accept the evidence at its face value, and try to ascertain the probable features of the more primitive flowers by an analysis of the features of those present-day groups which were certainly present in these early floras? This is a matter for further study, but a few examples may be given which suggest that such a study may have a bearing on the subject of this paper. In the Upper Cretaceous flora of South Carolina which was described by Berry(3) the Urticales seem to form one of the most abundant orders, and most palaeobotanists have agreed that plants allied to the modern Ficus were widespread at the time. Now the carpels of Ficus usually have a lateral style, while those of Dorstenia Poggei figured by Fries(7) are exactly of the type which was suggested above as being one of the most primitive forms, the style arising near the base of the ovary and</page><page sequence="23">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma I95 forking above into two stigmatic arms. Artocarpus, another genus which has existed since Cretaceous times, appears to have somewhat similar carpels. Berry states(3) that magnolias are common every- where in the Upper Cretaceous from Greenland to Alabama, while he considers that there is convincing evidence for the widespread occurrence of Liriodendron in the Cretaceous of North America. This view lends special interest to the above consideration of the stigmas in the Magnoliales. Turning to another aspect of floral structure, it will be remembered that considerable reference has been made above to the carpels of the Rosaceae, and this at once suggests the criticism that the Rosaceae cannot be regarded as a primitive family because of their peri- gynous flowers. But what do we find in the early floras? The Legu- minosae were undoubtedly present in the Eocene and probably in the Cretaceous, the Lauraceae were certainly well represented and there is fairly good evidence for the presence of other perigynous genera. These facts taken in conjunction with evidence derived from the Bennettitales and the Palaeozoic Pteridosperms ((25), p. 30) suggest that the hollow cup-like receptacle may be quite as primitive as the conical receptacle of the hypogynous flowers. This paper does not pretend to be a final solution of the many morphological problems touched upon, but it is intended to open up new lines of thought and investigation. The author also hopes to provoke criticism, and to lead those who hold other opinions to examine and state the foundations of their beliefs. SUMMARY i. The whole structure of our current floral morphology rests on the assumption that the floral parts represent modified foliage leaves, and this view leads to further corollaries. But the fundamental concept has no trustworthy foundation, and there is little prospect of the discovery of new supporting evidence. 2. In attempting to build up a new system by considering modem floral structures in the light of what we know concerning the lines of evolution in reproductive structures generally, the approach must be objective and phylogenetic. 3. The basic assumptions underlying any scheme of morphology should be clearly stated, and consequently the postulates of the new morphology are set out. 4. A system of morphological concepts should be applicable to every structural feature both internal and external. The evidence</page><page sequence="24">I96 H. HAMSHAw THOMAS from nine different lines of enquiry has to be co-ordinated when we attempt to reach an explanation of carpel structure, and the explana- tion must be reasonable in relation to the physiology of the structures involved. 5. The morphological nature of the carpel, its origin and evolu- tion are topics closely associated with the origin and evolution of the stigipa. 6. If we assume that the carpel originated by the infolding of a fertile leaf serious difficulties arise when we try to envisage the possible modes of origin of the stigma and the physiological results of any process of infolding. 7. The study of the tissue along which the pollen tubes pass from the stigma to the ovules should throw light on the nature of the stigma. From the evidence now available the stigma appears to be a modified portion of the inner surface of the ovary wall, and the tissue along which the pollen tubes travel, here designated the transmitting tissue, becomes a feature of morphological importance. 8. Robert Brown's view that each simple carpel has two lateral stigmas is revived, and is illustrated by reference to the genus Drimys. 9. Juel's studies on carpel structure in the Rosaceae suggest ways in which a double lateral stigma arising near the base of the carpel may have become modified in the production of more efficient structures. Support to the suggestion is furnished by ontogenetic studies of diverse plants. io. A new view of the possible origin of the stigma is brought forward which interprets the features previously noticed in modem plants by reference to the fossil Caytoniales and Pteridosperms. The carpel wall is regarded as derived from a pair of concrescent cupules, the two placentae representing fertile branch tips originally surrounded with a cupule. The stigmatic surfaces of a single carpel together with the transmitting tissue represent the marginal parts of the inner surface of the cupules lined with glandular hairs. The earliest stigmas arose near the lower part of the ventral side of the ovaries, but it is thought that where carpels or ovaries were crowded together natural selection would favour variation in which the stigma approached the free apex of the ovary. ii. This view agrees with what we know of the ontogeny of carpels; it explains the different forms of stigmas, especially the forked and commissural forms; it accounts for the main features of vascular anatomy, for the presence of transmitting tissue, and for the</page><page sequence="25">The Nature and Origin of the Stigma I97 prevalence of anatropous ovules. It may give a clue to the interpreta- tion of the various types of abnormal carpels which have been de- scribed. The course of evolution suggested seems to be physiologically possible; it greatly simplifies the interpretation of the varied forms of carpels and ovaries. I2. Reference is made to a series of fossil plants belonging to successive geological epochs, which seem to show that the course of evolution in certain Pteridospermae was tending towards the structure postulated above. The Caytoniales are regarded as showing an actual transition from gymnospermy to angiospermy. I3. It is suggested that the chief sections of flowering plants may have arisen from different groups of pteridosperms, and that the characteristics of the earliest flowers may be ascertainable by study- ing the modern representatives of those genera or families which can be safely identified in the Upper Cretaceous and Eocene floras. The more primitive flowers may have been very different from the types hitherto postulated. I4. This contribution is intended to open up new lines of thought and investigation. It is a challenge to those who hold other views to reconsider and state the foundations of their opinions. REFERENCES (i) ARBER, A. Floral anatomy and its morphological interpretation.
