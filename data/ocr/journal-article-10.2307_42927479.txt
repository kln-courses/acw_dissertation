<plain_text><page sequence="1">6 China Mainland RICHARD C. RUDOLPH Received 6 February 1961 An Important Dongson Site in Yünnan The excavation at Shihchai Shan in southwest China may well prove to be one of the most important Chinese archaeological events in recent years. This site is an early necropolis on the top of a low mound called Shihchai (Stone Fort) Hill on the eastern edge of Tien Lake, Chinning County, and about twenty miles south of Kunming, the provincial capital of Yünnan. In 1952 and 1953 the Yünnan Provincial Museum in Kunming bought some ten bronze weapons whose unusual decoration aroused the curiosity of museum authorities. Repeated inquiries traced the origin of these objects, to Shihchai Shan. Rumour had it that large numbers of such bronzes had been found there during the early part of the Sino- Japanese war, but they had been scattered and could no longer be traced. A survey of the site was made in October of 1954 and the subsequent digging of two test trenches in March of 195s.1 During this preliminary excavation two tombs were found and enough material was recovered to show that this site was of the same kind of early bronze drum culture complex that had long been associated with the Dongson culture of northern Indo-China. Realizing the importance of the site in southwest China, the Museum carried out extensive excavations from 1 November 1956 to 4 January 1957; twenty additional tombs were opened and over 3,500 objects made of bronze, iron, gold and semi-precious stones were recovered.2 This find is of prime importance for numerous reasons. In brief, it is the first site of this type found in southwest China and excavated under controlled condi- tions; it is extremely rich in grave goods and it throws much light on Dongson culture in general. Some of the material, hitherto unknown, is most startling and unusual and gives considerable information about the people who manufactured these things and at the same time poses new problems. Other material supplies additional examples of rare objects and may lead to the solution of some controversial problems. A description of the excavation of these twenty tombs and their contents is given in a very detailed and well illustrated report compiled by the Yünnan Provincial Museum.3 The present paper is a summary of a translation of the report made by the writer shortly after its appearance, in i960. 1 Yün-nan chin-ning shih-chai-shan ku i-chih chi mu-tsang ^ S lelilí" K'ao-ku hsüeh-pao 1956, 1, 43-63. 2 A preliminary account of this excavation, Yün-nan chin-ning shih-chai-shan ku mu ch'iin cKing-li chi appeared in Wen-wu ts'an-k'ao tzu-liao i957&gt; 4« 3 The definitive report, Yün-nan chin-ning shih-chai shan ku mu ch'ün fa-chiieh pao-kao SlŘlÍ4"Ě^^StÍBS£1Í!ř (Peking, September 1959), in two volumes.

A number of them had been disturbed by later burials and approximately ten other tombs had been destroyed by grave robbers. It is estimated that several hundred kilograms of bronzes were removed from this site during various illicit diggings prior to the first official excavation in 1955. The tombs are of irregular size, shape and depth. This is due to the fact that the top of this hill is strewn with large boulders which in most cases were used to form one or more sides or ends of the tombs. Wooden planks often were used to form the side or end of a tomb where there was no boulder. The original earth was used to cover the burial and this in turn was covered by a layer of pounded earth. Because there was no coffin chamber, many of the grave goods were broken or otherwise damaged in contact with the earth. Only three tombs contained significant amounts of skeletal material. Two were clearly dorsal burials with the head toward the west. In the third tomb, the corpse had been severed at the waist; the lower half was lying on the right side, the upper half on the left, and the head was in the middle of the torso. Clear scars on the bone indicate that this mutilation took place at the time of burial and not at a later date. Remains of coffins in five different tombs allow the reconstruction of a typical original. They appear to have been approximately 2 m. long and 0-85 m. wide, with the head slightly wider than the foot. Considerable quantities of flaked lacquer in some of the tombs indicate that the coffins were lacquered. In at least one tomb, planks about 4 cm. thick painted with red, black and green lacquer were placed under the coffin. On the sides and cover of the coffin in this tomb were found traces of fine, green and yellow silk and black and red lacquer. Grave Goods Bronze Implements . Of agricultural implements, there were found 21 plowshares for a type of foot plow, 28 spades and hoes, and 31 scythes and thin, long knives, the latter apparently for cutting grain or pruning. Tools for woodwork include 129 celts of various types, 23 chisels and a fragment of a saw about 22 cm. long and 4 cm. wide. Many are decorated with bird, rope and snake designs. Weapons . The ko ;Ä, usually translated as halberd or dagger-axe, is represented by 113 examples which are divided into nine types, but this classification may be too broad to suit some specialists. Figure 1 a illustrates the traditional type of ko in outline, measuring 26-5 cm. in length. It is notable for the peculiar anthropomorphic designs both on the blade and on the nei or shank. Nine identical weapons with these designs were found in tomb No. 12, and numerous other ko with variations of this design were found in other tombs, but prior to the discovery of this site only several examples of this interesting design were known and were the subject of much speculation. Figure 1 b is another type of weapon classified as ko. The</page><page sequence="3">CHINA MAINLAND RICHARD C. RUDOLPH 43 Fig. i.

The surface of the tube is decorated with alternating bands of triangles and spirals with a large snake at one end. Two hundred twenty-nine spear blades of eleven types were found. Some of them have animals in the round fastened to one side of the socket, and most of the sockets are decorated with spiral, plait and triangle designs; only a few of these objects are undecorated. Figure 1 c is one of 214 swords found in these tombs. This particular example has an overall length of 29-5 cm. and the blade is 20-5 cm. long. They are divided into 13 types and all but nine are highly decorated with a wide variety of animal and geometric designs. Figure id is an example of one of several swords whose hilts are cast in the shape of human beings. In this case the hilt, 10 cm. long, represents a weird soldier or guardian whose eyes are formed by spirals which are a continuation of the line depicting his nose. He wears armour and holds a short sword in his right hand. Other hafted weapons include 3 1 fu , 46 yiieh, 24 chüeh , and 6 chi . Most of them are decorated with figures of animals in the full round. Figure le and / are examples of the yiieh and the chi respectively. Fourteen crossbow mechanisms and 266 arrow points were also found. Domestic utensils. Among some 20 objects which more or less resemble the usual type of bronze containers of this period in China, one deserves special mention. This is a hu , a vase-like vessel with a long, tapering neck measuring 5-7 cm. at the opening. The belly is i8-8 cm. in diameter and the ringed foot is 13-4 cm. in diameter. The total height is 40 cm. It is noteworthy for the exceptionally fine engraved decoration covering its entire surface which is divided into three registers, the upper two are on the long neck. In the first are two flying phoenixes and in the second three standing deer. The belly of the vessel is covered with an alternating series of two leopards and two phoenixes. Other objects in this category are braziers, boxes, garment hooks, a bronze table and six mirrors. Cowrie shell containers . The twenty-seven containers made from, or resembling, the well-known bronze drums from northern Indo-China, found at this site, had been filled with cowrie shells at the time of burial. The container in tomb No. 13, for example, was entirely full of cowrie shells and seems originally to have consisted of two drums placed one on top of the other. The top drum disintegrated during the excavation, and the bottom one had to be reconstructed; its drum is 39*5 cm. and its circumference is 127-2 cm. at the top, 93 cm. at the waist, and 139*7 cm- at the foot. The top of the container was decorated with 21 cast figures of people and animals and seems to have represented a procession of people going to a fair. The height of the people ranges from 9 to 10-4 cm. A cover for a cowrie shell container was also found in tomb No. 13, but the container itself was in fragments. Its decoration represents a battle scene and includes cast figures of thirteen men and one horse (Pl. II). It is 30 cm. in diameter and the mounted figure in the centre, larger than the others, is apparently the leader of one of the contending groups. It is entirely gilded and is 11-7 cm. high; the horse is 12*7 cm. long. The rest of the figures are on foot and none is gilded. Their heights range from 6 to 9 cm. The central mounted figure wears a helmet</page><page sequence="5">CHINA MAINLAND RICHARD C. RUDOLPH 45 and armour and from a belt around his waist hangs a sword. He is barefooted, his left hand holds the reins of his horse and his right holds a spear, thrusting down with it. The horse is running forward with raised head and its harness is shown in complete detail. A human head hanging below the horse's neck is apparently from the decapitated man lying on the ground to the left and rear of the horse. The other figures are engaged in individual or group combat and show a high degree of animation. Another spectacular cowrie shell container, shown in Plate I, was found in tomb No. 12. The container is 53 cm. high and 29-5 cm. in diameter at its opening; two vertical cast tigers welded to its sides serve as handles. The cover for this container is 32 cm. in diameter and contains 127 people, a building and other objects in a crowded and complicated scene representing a human sacrifice. The height of the figures ranges from 3 to 6 cm. Some of them are bound, and one person, apparently a sacrificial victim, is being swallowed by a huge serpent. One particularly interesting aspect of this scene is that it clearly shows how the bronze drums were used ; another is that the ceremonies are being carried out by women. Musical instruments and figurines . Fifteen large bronze drums, also used as containers for cowrie shells, were found in these tombs. Large bronze figurines which originally stood upright on top of the drums had toppled in most cases under pressure of the surrounding earth. These drums obviously served the double function of musical instruments and of storage receptacles. A typical drum found in good condition is 31 cm. high, 143*5 cm- circumference at the top, 112 at the waist, and 151-5 at the base. Their tops and sides are highly decorated. Such drums have been known for a long time and have been the subject of various studies. The important thing about this particular group of drums, however, is that they were excavated under known conditions, and they contain new pictorial elements, and were found associated with a very large number of other objects. With this group of fifteen drums we have an important body of material for studies in their chronology of such drums and their decoration changes. In the east end of tomb No. 6, were found six bronze bells, arranged in two rows of three bells each. They are lentoid in section, have a flat mouth, and taper slightly toward the bottom. They have a suspension device at the top and they range in height from 29 to 40*3 cm. The bodies of all six bells are decorated with cast designs of eight dragons arranged in four rows of two dragons each. Near the mouth is a band of plait and spiral design. Four examples of a type of mouth organ, the shenglĚ. , were recovered. In general, these instruments consist of a peach-shaped bowl at one end, into which tubes of varying length may be inserted through openings, and a tapering hollow stem through which air is forced into the bowl and out through the tubes. The largest of the four is 60 cm. in length and has nicely cast figures of a tiger and ox welded onto the end of the stem. Four figures of dancing barefoot women were found in the east end of tomb No. 17. Each figure is 9 cm. high and has a peg on the bottom of the feet whereby it was attached to some other object. One figure plays a sheng , and all of them wear large discs at their waists. A single composition containing eight dancers and</page><page sequence="6">46 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 4 , i960 musicians attached to a framework was found in tomb No. 13. This object measures 9*5 by 13 cm. and is divided into two registers with the dancers above and musicians below. The whole object is gilded. Besides other dancing figurines, there were found nine large kneeling or squatting bronze figures in various tombs. They were originally placed on top of drums or cowrie shell containers. Five of them are women, all are barefoot and originally held a type of parasol in their hands. The height of the figures ranges from 26 to 47 cm. The height of the parasol in one case is 104 cm. Handicrafts . Eighty-eight circular bronze objects were recovered from thirteen tombs. These apparently are the discs attached to the belts of some of the figurines already described; the surfaces of most of them are inlaid with malachite, jade, or carnelian. Some have bronze figures mounted either on the surface or around the edge of the disc. They vary in size from 8 to 18 cm. in diameter. Fifty-three orna- ments from ten tombs are reminiscent of the so-called Sino-Siberian animal style. These plaques range from 5*5 cm. to 12-7 cm. in height and from 8 cm. to 20 cm. in length and are cast in the half round. They are well made and show an extremely high degree of artistic skill. Most of them represent animals in combat, including oxen, leopards, wolves, deer, tigers, boars and domestic animals. Plate IV is typical of these plaques. It measures 12-7 by 16-7 cm. and shows two animals attacking a deer. There are also hunting scenes in which mounted men attack wild animals. Other small objects in this category represent musical scenes, small figures of otters and water birds catching fish, the heads of birds and animals, and a group of prisoners. Three plaques were found representing part of a structure in two or three levels and men in the act of capturing a bull going through a door. One from tomb No. 3, is 5*7 cm. high and 9 cm. long and has three rows of people above and around an open door. At the top of the structure are 10 kneeling people who appear to be spectators; in the middle, just above and on each side of the door, are eight kneeling figures with the exception of one standing directly over the door; in the bottom row there are nine figures in tense-kneeling or standing as though ready to seize the bull which has just started coming through the doorway. Three models of houses were also found. Like the three plaques above, these are similar but not identical to each other. The houses recovered from tomb No. 3 is 9 cm. high, 12 cm. wide, and 7 cm. deep; it is supported by piles and thus, in a sense, has two levels; its roof is similar to that seen in Southeast Asia today. The house has one rectangular room with walls on the front and two ends and a verandah on these three sides. On the verandah and in the house there are people in various attitudes; some are playing music, some appear to be dancing, and others are kneeling. Steps lead to the ground in front of the house where there are people and animals. Finíais and horse trappings . Twenty-seven finely executed finials ranging from 5 to 12*5 cm. in length were found. They represented oxen, deer, hare, peacocks, falcons, snakes, human beings, bronze drums. In seven tombs 260 articles used as decorations or functional parts of chariots and harness were found.</page><page sequence="7">CHINA MAINLAND RICHARD C. RUDOLPH 47 Coins and seals. Three pan-liang coins were found in tomb No. 13 and give evidence that they belonged to the time of Emperor Wen (179-156 b.c.). A total of 180 wu-shu coins were found in tombs No. 5 and 8. They are divided into two groups; one dates from 140-73 b.c., and the other from 73-6 b.c. One small, square seal, measuring 1-1 cm. on each side and 0*45 cm. in thickness, which was found in tomb No. 20, appears to be a private seal, one of a pair, but its inscription cannot be identified. Miscellaneous . Among other fragmentary and miscellaneous objects excavated, perhaps the most interesting is an engraved strip of bronze found in tomb No. 13 (Fig. 2). It was originally divided into at least five registers, four of which are complete and a fraction of a fifth still remain. It is 42 cm. long, 12*5 cm. wide, and o*i cm. thick; at the top is a hole for suspension; the top register which is the longest is about twice the length of the others; among other pictures it has a man locked in a cangue, a large bird resembling a pheasant, various animal heads and other unknown designs. A bound prisoner appears in the second register and another in a cangue in the third; in all cases they are kneeling and have braided hair. This plaque appears to be some sort of mnemonic device or an attempt at picto- graphic writing. Iron Implements . Among the ten iron implements re- covered, the most interesting are two socketed celts from tomb No. 13. Their composition is of both bronze and iron, the lower third of the cutting end being of iron. The joint welding the two metals can Fig. 2. Engraved strip of bronze from tomb No. 13, Shihchai Shan. be clearly seen. They are 13-5 cm. long and their blades are 4-4 cm. wide. Other iron implements include a celt, an axe and two knives. Weapons. Thirty-four spear blades were found, half of which had bronze sockets. Two chi, a weapon which combines the halberd (ko) and the spear (mao), with iron blades and bronze sockets were found. A total of 69 swords were discovered; 48 of them had bronze handles and 16 had gold scabbards. Gold Weapons. Four tombs yielded a total of 35 gold scabbards. In most cases they were highly decorated and show that the craftsman of that time had a complete mastery of this medium (Pl. III).</page><page sequence="8">48 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 4 , i960 Ornaments . Three pieces of armour designed to protect the arm were found. These weighed 239, 200*7 and 418 grams respectively. All come from tomb No. 13 and No. 12. There were also hairpins, bracelets, plaques representing animals, buckles, and great quantities of quatrefoil and other types of buttons and plain and fancy beads. Seal of the Prince of Tien . This was found in tomb No. 6 on the bottom of a lacquered coffin. It has a knob or handle on it in the form of a coiled and scaled snake. Each side measures 2-4 cm. and its body is 0-7 cm. thick. The overall height is 2 cm. and it weighs 90 grams. The knob and the body were cast in separate pieces and later welded. The inscription is engraved, and traces of the graving tool can still be seen. The four seal style characters read Tien wang chih yiny 'Seal of the Prince of Tien' In the Shih Chi , or Historical Records, a fundamentally reliable work compiled in the first century b.c., in Chapter 116 it is recorded that in the second year of the Yüan Feng period of the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han dynasty (109 b.c.), the emperor presented a gold seal to the prince or king of the region of Tien. In that time Tien covered the area where these excavations were made, but whether this is the very seal that was presented by Emperor Wu, it is not certain. The gold in this seal is of 95/100 fineness. Pottery and Stone Objects Little pottery, in comparison with the large number of bronze articles, was found and most of it was in fragments. Only several containers were more or less complete but these are of interest because the tou type has the characteristics of those found in Changsha which date from the Warring States Period. Some of the pottery stoves, boxes and vases that could be reconstructed are very similar to those found in Western Han tombs at Changsha. Only two types of objects, whorls and pellets, were made of pure clay. The clay of other objects had considerable sand, shell or quartz in it. Most of the vessels were wheel-made and other objects were made by the scraper and beater method. The colour of the pottery varies from red to grey and is not uniform due to lack of control of the temperature. Pendants of all sizes, bracelets, perforated discs, buttons, beads and miniature figures of animals were made from stone, jade and other semi-precious stone. A considerable quantity of jade objects shaped like the controversial magatama of Korea and Japan were also discovered. Conclusion A long and involved conclusion stresses the importance of this material for the information it gives on the life of the people of the Tien region some 2,000 years ago. It discusses possible connections with other groups, their contacts with the Chinese from whom they must have learned bronze casting, and the date of the tombs. The twenty tombs uncovered in the second excavation are classified into four chronological groups according to the presence or absence of certain objects in them. This classification is clearly set forth in a detailed and very useful table at the end of the work. Relying principally upon coins, mirrors, weapons and the seal of the Prince of Tien, as well as the scarcity of iron and the absence of objects</page><page sequence="9">PLATE I Body and top of bronze cowrie shell container from tomb No. 12 at Shihchai Shan, Southwest China.

In brief, the evidence available leads them to conclude that these tombs cover in time the period of the Western Han dynasty or the first two centuries before Christ. Taiwan Exhibition Chinese Art and Archœology in the United States After a long period of negotiation between the United States and Chinese governments and painstaking selection by a committee of American and Chinese art and museum experts, residents of this country will soon have an opportunity to see a large collection of the finest specimens of Chinese art and archaeology. A detailed agreement covering the selection, transportation, handling, packing, exhibition, insurance, legal title and return of the objects was drawn up by the two governments and signed on 12 February i960 by Ambassador George K. C. Yeh of the Republic of China and Huntington Cairns, Secretary-Treasurer and General Counsel of the National Gallery of Art. The collection will be exhibited in Taiwan before and after it is shown in the United States. It will remain in the latter country for approximately one year and will be exhibited in only five cities. Other cities have requested to be included in the tour but these requests have been rejected by the authorities concerned due to the added risk of damage to the objects through the additional handling and packing that these shows would involve. The schedule, subject to slight variation, is : Washington, D.C., National Gallery of Art 1 June-15 August 1961 New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art 15 September-i November 1961 Boston, Museum of Fine Arts 1 December-15 January 1962 Chicago, Art Institute 15 February-i April 1962 San Francisco, M. H. De Young Memorial Museum 1 May-15 June 1962 In the transportation of valuable art objects over long distances the question of safety naturally arises. In this particular case, every possible safeguard is being taken to protect these objects from loss and damage and to ensure their return to Free China. They will be carried both ways in United States naval vessels and will be heavily insured while in the United States. Title to these objects remains at all times with the Republic of China. Participating museums are liable for any loss or damage and many additional safety precautions are specified in the contract between the two governments. A Chinese official will be in charge of the collection at all times and he and a party of Chinese personnel not to exceed four in number will accompany it to all cities where it is shown. The exhibition will include over 100 paintings as well as examples of calligraphy, pottery and porcelain, bronzes, jades and other objects from remote times to the 19th century. These objects have been selected from the great collections in the National Palace Museum, formerly kept on the Mainland but now in Taiwan. Those interested particularly in the archaeology of China will be disappointed to learn that, contrary to earlier announcements, the important Shang dynasty sculptures and bronzes from the famous Anyang excavations will not be included.</page><page sequence="14">Bibliography 50 ASIAN PERSPECTIVES 4, i960 * CPAM : The Commission for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments.

Mentor Book, The New American Library of World Literature, Inc., New York i960. 240 pp., index. US$0*50. Material culture can better be related to living culture and living peoples when one knows the philosophy of those peoples. The author presents briefly and clearly a history of Chinese philosophy from late Shang times to the present. For the archaeologist who does not already have a good knowledge of Chinese thinking, this book is a very good foundation to start with. One minor probable error is Creel's statement indicating the practice of polygamy in China (pp. 1 1 and 28). Polygyny yes, but I do not recall that polyandry was ever practised to any extent.</page></plain_text>
