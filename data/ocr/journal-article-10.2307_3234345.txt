<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Corporation as Government: Challenges &amp; Dilemmas* David Vogel University of California, Berkeley Professor Vogel's article is an introduction to the literature of the busi- ness corporation as government and a valuable analysis of the problem itself-the publicness of the corporation and the legitimacy and ac- countability of its government. His essay indicates both the impact of the contemporary counter-corporate movement and its limits, inherent in working within populist ideas. When people think of the business cor- poration as a public institution rather than a private one, there are conse- quences, he suggests, but whether the effects have been or are likely to be really basic concerning who wields power and for what ends is more doubtful. David Vogel has a B.A. from Queens College, New York City, and a Ph.D. from Princeton. He is assistant professor in the School of Business Administration at the University of California, Berkeley, which he joined in 1973. He teaches courses concerning the social, political, and legal environment of business. * This article is a revised version of a paper presented to the 1973 convention of the American Political Science Association.

Introduction In 1959 Robert Dahl criticized political scientists for their lack of interest in the business corporation: "There is a dearth of important or even ur- gent questions. But political scientists do not, by and large, seem to be searching for answers." 1 Eleven years later, Dahl, perhaps impatient with the lack of response of his colleagues to his exhortation, heeded his own call. In After the Revolution, at the annual meetings of the stock- holders of General Motors, and on the Op-Ed page of the New York Times he suggests the relevance of political precepts toward understand- ing the structure of power of privately owned business enterprises.2 Dahl's 1959 strictures have remained relevant for nearly fifteen years. In 1962 James March noted, Political scientists have generally defined their field in a relatively modest way, limiting their attention to phenomena that occur in, or in close conjunction with, explicitly governmental institutions.... By any reasonably descriptive definition of political science, the business firm is outside the domain.3 A decade later, Harry Eckstein observed, Until quite recently, the predominant conception of political phe- nomena was, quite simply that they had to do with "governments," together with organizations subsumed to them.., .or directly im- pinging on them. It has often been argued that "private governments" should be far more widely and intensively studied than they are . . . The argu- ments, unfortunately, have not been widely acted upon in prac- tice.4 1. Robert A. Dahl, "Business and Politics: A Critical Appraisal of Political Science," in Robert A.

A major preoccupation of the British pluralists at the turn of the century was the normative implications of nongovernmental authorities. Harold Laski and G. D. H. Cole were interested in the importance of intermediate levels of authority between the common and the universal as a way of mediating the dangers of excessive authority in an overpowering state.5 Simultaneously, in the United States Arthur Bentley in The Process of Government examined the political impact of nongovernmental author- ity systems. He wrote, "A corporation is a government through and through." 6 A generation later, Charles Francis Merriam published Pub- lic and Private Government in which he argued that "the thread of gov- ernance runs throughout all the web of social life in varying forms, in varying units." 7 Concern with nongovernmental economic power and its incompatibility with democratic authority forms a critical part of the ar- gument of three of the important critiques of contemporary American pluralism published during the sixties: Private Power and American De- mocracy by Grant McConnell; The Decline of American Pluralism by Henry Kariel; and The Theory of Democratic Elitism by Peter Bach- rach.8 And for nearly twenty years, Earl Latham has been arguing that the corporation is best understood as a political system.9 To recognize that the business corporation merits analysis as a politi- cal system in its own right-and not solely in terms of its interaction with quiry," presented to 1972 Annual Meeting of the American Political Science Association, pp. 2, 44. 5.

It stops short, however, of an examination of the political implications of this conception. To regard the business cor- poration as a political institution is not only of academic significance; it also has important consequences for the legitimacy of the corporation in the society. This latter issue is raised but not resolved by defining the corporation as political on the basis of a comparison of its functions with those of the state. What does it mean for political actors in the society (as con- trasted with political scientists) to regard the business corporation as a political body? Under what political and social conditions do citizens cease to regard the corporation primarily as an economic and social en- tity and begin to conceive of it in political terms as well? What are the limitations of this recognition? In short, what is the interplay between the analytic and the phenomenological conceptions of the corporation as a "political" body? These questions have acquired particular relevance in light of the re- cent resurgence of hostility to business in the United States. The years 1965 to the present mark the third period during the twentieth century that the attitudes of the American people toward business have been rela- tively hostile.1' Public confidence in the leaders of business has declined over fifty percent since 1966; in 1972 only twenty-seven percent of the public expressed a great deal of confidence in business leadership." In that same year only twenty-nine percent of the population felt that "busi- ness strikes a good balance between profits and services"; this figure con- trasts with seventy percent four years earlier.12 This development is re- flected in the effort on the part of citizens to expand their definition of political conduct to include the policies and decision-making processes of the large business corporation.

The purpose of this essay is to document the emergence of the contemporary "counter-corporate movement," explore some of its strategies and perspectives, and assess its political significance. II. The Crisis of Corporate Legitimacy In 1932 Adolf A. Berle, Jr., a professor of law, and Gardiner C. Means, an economist, published their seminal work on the American business corporation, The Modern Corporation and Private Property.'3 The main significance of their study lay in its redefinition of the nature of property in an advanced capitalist society. According to Berle and Means, con- trol over industrial property no longer rested in the hands of those who received the fruits of ownership: "This dissolution of the atom of prop- erty destroys the very foundation on which the economic order of the past three centuries has rested." 14 By arguing that the management of corporations had, in principle, acquired a significant measure of auton- omy from the suppliers of capital-a kind of capitalism without capital- ists-the authors challenged "the fundamental economic principle of individual initiative in individual enterprise." 15 A recent study of cor- porate social responsibility notes: The possibility that large-scale corporate enterprise may not be act- ing legitimately, may not be socially responsible, even though not violating the antitrust laws, has to be taken seriously, however, since the appearance in 1932 of the Berle and Means classic.. . these authors undermined confidence that the pinch of profit legitimized the decisions of large firms with respect to pricing, wage policy, in- vestment, community welfare ... . 1 The doctrine of competitive capitalism offered a reasonably coherent explanation and defense of the power of the business corporation throughout most of the nineteenth century. Firms, which were simply extensions of the private property of their owners, strove to maximize profits. Competitive markets effectively circumscribed their power and 13. Adolf A.

Corporations thus required no specific justifications for their authority that differed from the legiti- mating ideology of the capitalist system as a whole. At the end of the nineteenth century, however, American capitalism became transformed in two fundamental respects. First, the industrial market structure ceased to be primarily competitive. Between 1895 and 1900, a merger wave created over 5,000 trusts covering practically every line of productive activity.17 As a consequence of these mergers, the cap- ital requirements of many corporations could no longer be met by the personal wealth of their original owners. The joint-stock company re- placed the individual proprietor as the significant unit of industrial or- ganization. Thus, in the span of one decade two critical ideological props of industrial capitalism became inoperative. The apparent lack of ac- countability of management was further exacerbated by the development of corporate law; as of 1890 the corporate character ceased to provide any meaningful restrictions on the scope, size or internal structure of the corporate enterprise.'s Interest in the locus of control in large firms and its implications for the development of the corporation has concerned students of business for two centuries. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith wrote: The directors of (joint-stock) companies, however, being the man- agers rather of other people's money than of their own, it cannot well be expected, that they should watch over it with the same anx- ious vigilance with which the partners in a private copartnery fre- quently watch over their own.19 Ninety years later, Marx observed in Volume III of Capital that, the stock company is a transition toward the conversion of all func- tions in the reproductive process which still remain linked with cap- italist property, into mere functions of associated producers into social functions.... This is the abolition of the capitalist mode of production within 17. Harold Faulkner, The Decline of Laissez Faire, 1897-1917 (New York: Rinehart and Co., 1951), p. 162. 18.

It is private production without the control of private property.20 Yet the significance of the separation of ownership and control must be understood critically. As recently as 1967 a study indicated that in ap- proximately one-third of the 520 largest industrial corporations, indi- viduals or families owned sufficient shares of stock to exercise effective control. Moreover, the ownership of stock is highly concentrated: as of 1962, 41 percent of publicly held stock owned by individuals, by value of equity, was held by spending units whose total wealth was 2,000,000 dollars or more ... while only four percent was held by units whose total wealth was less than 25,000.21 More importantly, the available evidence suggests that the impact of the separation of ownership and formal control on the behavior of manage- ment is inconsequential.22 How are we then to account for the impact of the Berle and Means thesis? Its significance is primarily ideological. As long as markets re- mained largely competitive, the internal political structure of the firm was of only secondary concern; if the firm had no discretion, it did not matter who did not exercise it. When the competitive market declined in importance, the corporation was exposed as an institution that was run in the interests of those who controlled it, rather than according to the demands of the public. The erosion of external corporate accountability thus prompted interest in the legitimacy of management; the doctrine of social responsibility was advanced as an alternative to the competitive market. The issue is not whether there are economic constraints on man- agement-there obviously are-but whether those constraints guarantee an appropriate balance among the interests of shareholders, consumers, and workers. On this issue the evidence is equally clear; they do not.23 20. Quoted in Shlomo Avineri, The Social and Political Thought of Karl Marx (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), p. 178. 21.

The New Deal was no more successful than the first Roosevelt ad- ministration in confronting the problem of corporate legitimacy. Torn on one hand by a nostalgia for the competitive ideal and a compassion for the "little fellow," and on the other by a desire for the high level of ma- terial prosperity that large economic units were thought capable of secur- ing, New Deal policy foundered indecisively between national economic planning and vigorous antitrust enforcement. The former was hampered by the persistence of a popular belief in competitive markets, and the latter by the force of business power.24 The major policy contribution of the New Deal to the problem of cor- porate authority was a legal one. Confronted by The Modern Corpora- tion's exposure of the lack of shareholder participation in business decision-making, government policy makers attempted to restore the power of the shareholder.25 The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 established a variety of devices to increase the accountability of manage- ment to shareholders, including financial disclosure requirements, share- holder elections of Boards, and annual meetings. As a device to restore corporate democracy, the attempt has been judged a failure.26 Neverthe- less, by giving legal sanction to the principles of democratic rule, even if shareholder "elections" came to resemble more closely those of the So- viet Union than the United States, the Securities and Exchange Act ex- pressed a public recognition that corporate government should, in prin- ciple, be subject to the various mechanisms of democratic procedure that are associated with government. Adopted by the New York Stock Ex- change in their slogan "people's capitalism"-a phrase that ironically re- calls the "people's democracies" of Eastern Europe-the symbolism of the Act was not lost upon subsequent critics of business. In spite of the relatively uncritical acceptance of the performance of the business system in the twenty-five years following World War ii, the lack of the restraints postulated by classical economic theory on the management of the corporation-personified in the traditional roles of 24.

They increasingly began to turn to methods of political analysis in an attempt to relegitimize the business corporation. The political or governmental nature of the corporation be- came, for both critics and defenders of corporate prerogatives, a basic assumption of both empirical and theoretical analysis.28 Since The Modern Corporation, many writers on the corporation, in- cluding Drucker (1942), Berle (1954), and Moore (1962), have at- tempted to establish a basis for the authority of management that recog- nizes the obsolescence of the nineteenth-century perception of the firm.29 Relatively sympathetic to the existing structure of the corporate system, they have based their efforts on the unexceptional assumption that any system of authority and privilege, whether governmental or nongovern- mental, must, to maintain itself, formulate an ideology or philosophy which justifies its prerogatives "in a manner generally acceptable to the leaders of thought in the community." 30 In large measure their discus- sion has remained on a metaphysical level: witness Berle's innovation of the "corporate soul" as a substitute for legal and economic constraints on management authority. In effect, they have sought to appropriate the terminology of the democratic political process as a way of legitimating 27. See Thomas C. Cochran, The American Business System (New York: Harper and Row, 1957), for a discussion of the ebb and flow of public atti- tudes toward business during the first half of the century. 28.

Thus, the contemporary literature on the corporation is replete with terms borrowed from political science, that is, constituency, legitimacy, (shareholder) elections, constitutional- ism, interest-group, (consumer) sovereignty, "social contract," etc. The users of these terms imply that what is at issue is not so much the power of business as the way in which we should talk about it. Berle's cele- brated comparison of business executives to feudal barons is thus strik- ingly apt; in the final analysis, neither is subject to democratic rule. Compared to the justifications for laissez faire capitalism, based on the ideology of competition, the proposed defense of twentieth-century cap- italism is rather unconvincing. It provides no operational or normative criteria by which the performance of management may be judged. The response of critics to the modem corporation's crisis of legitimacy has taken a divergent tack. Rather than reformulate ideology to square with political reality, they have attempted to restructure political reality to reflect corporate philosophy. Beginning in the 1960's, a number of writers, predominately lawyers, argued that the double standard of polit- ical accountability which applies to governmental and nongovernmental institutions is indefensible. Political institutions should be subject to rea- sonably similar standards of democratic and republican rule. Earl La- tham suggests: The problem is. .. one of imposing on the corporation the same limitations that experience has shown must be laid upon the exer- cise of power in the public government, if the "welfare and rights of the entire mass of people are the main consideration, rather than the privileges of class or the will of a monarch," to recall the law dictionary definition.31 Arthur Miller echoes a similar proposition: the corporation ... is a species of private government and thus sub- ject to the same evaluations that are and should be made about public government. If they are governments, or are like governments, then they are subject to the time-honored limitations on governments.32 More recently, Peter Bachrach argued: Obviously General Motors is not the United States government. However, there is a basic similarity between the two: they both au- 31. Earl Latham, "The Commonwealth of the Corporation," op. cit. 32. A. Miller, op. cit., p. 120.</page><page sequence="11">David Vogel 15 thoritatively allocate values for the society. It is on the basis of this similarity that General Motors and other giant private governments should be considered a part of the political sector in which demo- cratic norms apply.33 Finally, in After the Revolution, published in 1970, Robert Dahl explic- itly challenged the private status of the corporation and attempted to place corporate governance on the national political agenda: "Whatever may be the optimal way of governing the great corporation, surely it is a delusion to consider it a private enterprise." 34 With the exception of Dahl's proposals about the possible future of the authority structure of corporations, the above quotations are of in- terest primarily as objects of historical curiosity. Their impact on the politics of the 1960's was minimal. Only in the area of internal due pro- cess for individuals was there an effort to place limitations on the au- thority of management. On this issue, provoked by the popular concern with the submergence of the individual in the large organization which dominated criticism of business during the fifties and early sixties, there was widespread agreement on the importance of establishing some sort of constitutional structure within the firm.35 The guarantee by the federal government of the rights of workers to bargain collectively had established a legal and political precedent for the protection of employees from the arbitrary exercise of the power of management.36" The conception of business as a system of power, or as a private gov- ernment, is inherently ambiguous. On one hand, it confers a certain legitimacy on the decisions of management, which during times of rela- tive public acquiscence of business, constitutes a reasonably viable sup- port of the political status quo. On the other hand, it contains a funda- mental challenge to the private nature of corporate accountability to the community: if the corporation is a government, should it not be subject to republican and democratic norms? The politically relevant question is not whether the corporation should be considered a political or social institution, but whether it should be considered a public one. To classify the corporation as a private government is, in principle, to raise the issue of the internal legitimacy of the authority of management. By contrast, 33.

The publicization of the corpora- tion, as advocated by Latham, Buchanan, Miller, Bachrach, and Dahl, thus challenges not simply the internal legitimacy of management but the accountability of the corporation as a whole to the society. III. The Contemporary Counter-Corporate Movement III A. Introduction: Beginning in the late 1960's, the problem of corporate legitimacy reappeared on the agenda of American politics. It ceased to be the exclusive concern of a handful of academics and thought- ful spokesmen for corporations and moved into the arena of public con- troversy. Despite its unchanged private status in the eyes of the law, political actors began to treat the corporation as if it were a public gov- ernment by subjecting it to the same modes of political participation, the same degree of scrutiny and the same standards of accountability that American democratic thought and practice consign to the sovereign state: citizens began to realize in practice what scholars, such as, Latham, Bachrach, and Dahl, have asserted in theory-namely, that corporations should be treated like public governments. A considerable body of literature over the past twenty years has dis- cussed the collapse of the distinction between government and business. Social critics, such as, Reagan, Mills, Harrington, Galbraith, and Reich have examined various aspects of the fusion of private and public power which characterizes post-World War ii American capitalism."37 This fu- sion is expressed in such phrases as the "military-industrial complex," the "social-industrial complex," the "pollution-industrial complex," and more generally, the "corporate state." In Galbraith's charming phrase- ology, "The line here (with respect to large specialized weapons firms) between public and private enterprise is so exotic as to be impalpable." 3 To suggest that the corporation not only exercises a sort of govern- mental authority, but in fact is an indivisible part of the political gov- ernment itself, represents one perception of the corporation as a political 37.

Equally significant, and in no way contradictory, is a political and ideological analysis that treats the business corporation as a political institution in its own right, regardless of its integration with the government. From the perspective of political actors who have chosen to subject the corporation to the methods of political protest that characterize their interaction with the government, the two perspectives are often complimentary: General Motors is a criti- cal and important part of the system of governance in the United States: at the same time it is also a distinctive institution that directly exercises political power. Each of these statements refers to different levels of political analysis; they are both integral to an understanding of the im- pact of business in society. To regard the corporation as a public institution involves three dimen- sions. First, citizens must make demands directly on it. Secondly, they should behave towards it in ways that are similar to their behavior to- ward the state. Thirdly, they should seek to apply to it modes of account- ability and responsibility similar to those they apply to the public govern- ment. These three aspects of corporate publicization are not empirically distinct; they are dimensions of any behavior that deals with the corpor- ation as a public institution. We present our data under the dimension that most appropriately illuminates their significance to the current pub- licization of the business corporation. III B. The Focus of Political Demands: The most distinctive aspect of contemporary criticism of the business corporation is the extent to which various institutions, individuals, organizations, and communities are making direct demands on the business corporation. While business has been confronted with a variety of attacks on its power and perfor- mance throughout the history of the American republic, these criticisms, for the most part, were directed at the state. Whether arising from popu- lists, reformers, or socialists, the demands were for more extensive gov- ernment supervision of corporate activities. There have, of course, been exceptions to this pattern: one of the first hostile acts of the American colonialists against the crown was to destroy the property of a business corporation, the British East India Company. The history of labor union organizing in the United States is largely the story of the immediate con- frontation between private corporate armies and workers-a struggle which at times took on the dimensions of a civil war. Nevertheless, the predominant pattern is clear: demands on the business corporation were routed through the government. This pattern began to shift in the mid-sixties.39 As the civil-rights 39.

In 1964 the NAACP began a series of nationwide demonstrations against the General Motors Corporation to protest discrimination in industrial employment.40 In the same year a coalition of civil-rights groups in the Bay Area challenged the hiring policies of local hotels, car dealerships, and banks.41 Operation Breadbasket, an economic arm of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, organized a consumer boycott of A&amp;P stores in the greater New York area to protest a variety of concerns affecting the interests of the black community. In 1971 twenty-four clergymen sat in at A&amp;P's headquarters.42 The most dramatic confrontation between the civil-rights movement and a corporation occurred in Rochester, New York. In 1968 a coalition of church groups and FIGHT, a community organization led by the professional organizer Saul Alinsky, succeeded in making their demand that Kodak hire unskilled black workers into a national political issue. Alinsky pioneered the idea of using the annual shareholders' meeting and the corporate proxy machinery as a device for raising social issues.43 From the very beginning of the antiwar movement, business was a direct target of protest. In part, this stemmed from the anti-imperialist ideology that defined much of the political orientation of the American left.44 Business was closely identified with American foreign policy in general and the Vietnam intervention in particular; it was seen not only as largely responsible for the war but also as its prime beneficiary.

Be- tween 1966 and 1970 Dow Chemical was the focus of 221 major campus demonstrations.45 Beginning in 1970, this dimension of corporate publicization-the direct "petitioning" of the corporation by the citizenry for "redress of grievances"-became more significant. A study by the Batelle Seattle Research Center traces the source of pressures and demands on business over a six-year period. It concludes: Though the total number of demands and pressures increased sig- nificantly in the period under study, the proportion of demands and pressures raised by government declined and the importance of in- dependent individuals and citizens' groups in this process increased considerably.46 In 1965, seventy-four percent of the demands and pressures on business originated in government while only nine percent stemmed from "the public." In 1970 the numbers are fifty-nine percent and twenty-one per- cent respectively; for 1971 the relevant figures are forty-eight percent and twenty-six percent.47 During the last seven years, at least eight major corporations have been subject to bombings, sabotage, or burnings; more than thirty firms have experienced protests or disruptions at their annual meetings, and half a dozen have been subject to boycotts over social issues.48 Anticorporate activity has also figured prominently in the two most important movements of social change of the seventies: the women's movement and the struggle to preserve the environment. In April 1971, the National Organization of Women (Now) adopted a "stockholder action program" to press for equal employment opportunities for women in American corporations. The first "Earth Day," April 22, 1970, coin- cided with the annual shareholders meeting of General Electric Corpora- tion. The coincidence was a historic one; from the very beginning the environmental movement has been closely identified with criticism of corporate behavior. From 1965 and 1971, thirty-four percent of the de- mands and pressure on business were in the area of environmental pro- 45. See Sethi, "Dow Shalt Not Kill...," op. cit., pp. 236-266. 46. R.

Modes of Political Behavior: A second major dimension of corporate publicization involves the transfer of the modes of political participation from the government to the corporation. Indeed, through- out the sixties a general pattern of publicization of institutions was ap- parent. Beginning with the government, it moved almost wholesale to the university and from there to the corporation. As we explore various aspects of corporate publicization, clear parallels between changing pub- lic expectations and demands with respect to both nongovernmental in- stitutions should become increasingly obvious. In principle, a democratic society is characterized by the continuous and careful monitoring of government policies by independent citizens' institutions, particularly the press. Not only has the scrutiny of corporate activities by the press increased, but a number of organizations have been formed with the express purpose of providing continuous monitor- ing of corporate conduct. The oldest and most respected, dubbed by Business Week the "Dun and Bradstreet of Social Responsibility," is the Council on Economic Priorities (CEP)-an independent, privately fi- nanced research organization with offices in New York and San Fran- cisco. Headed by Alice Tepper Marlin, a former financial analyst, the Council "researches, compiles, and disseminates information" 0o on cor- porate conduct in five areas: fair employment, the environment, war production, international investment, and political influence. According to Marlin: We believe that the public has a legitimate need for facts and fig- ures which will permit them to evaluate the social performance of U.S. corporations. The Council's purpose is to respond to that need by disseminating detailed information on corporate practices which have the greatest impact on the quality of American life.5" In On the Jewish Question, Karl Marx states his well-known critique of the double standard of bourgeois society: Where the political state has attained to its full development, man leads, not only in thought, in consciousness, but in reality, in life, a double existence-celestial and terrestrial. He lives in the political 49. R. Coppock, et al., op. cit. 50. "Social Dividends-A New Corporate Responsibility," Trends (October 1970), p. 1. 51.

Consuming and investing, which are "economic" decisions, are legitimately guided by only self- interest. In this context, a distinctive aspect of the second dimension of cor- porate publicization lies in the increasing consideration of social factors in both investment and consumption decisions. The development is ironic: as political scientists attempt to apply the norms of economic maximization to predict the decisions of individuals in the political "mar- ketplace," citizens are beginning to consider the possibilities of employ- ing "public" standards of judgment in the economic arena. One manifestation of this development is in the area of consumption. Traditionally, consumer boycotts have been periodically organized to support the demands of workers on strike. Over the last seven years, they have been extended to encompass a variety of other issues: produc- tion of war materials (ITT, Dow), investment in Angola (Gulf), and participation in the identity card system in South Africa (Polaroid). They have become a major vehicle of popular protest against business. During the last three years awareness of the "social" or public dimen- sions of consumer choice has been aggravated by the environmental movement. The distinction between consumerism and ecology has always been an artificial one: to the extent that one raises critical questions about the social and political implications of either criticism, the boun- daries between them appear artificial. As early as Packard's The Waste- makers, published in 1960, the links between "conspicuous consump- tion" and the waste of natural resources was a subject of widespread public discussion. The impact of subsequent best-sellers such as Silent Spring (1962), The New Industrial State (1967), and most recently The Closed Circle (1971);" has reinforced this perception. A recent 52. T. B.

"4 As environmental concern increases, there is a tendency-still more celebrated than measurable-for "ecologically responsible" citizens to express their identification with the public interest by their private pur- chasing decisions. People can thus influence environmental issues by "voting" with their dollars, as well as with their ballot. In effect, they are taking seriously the analogy between "dollar" votes and political votes, which forms the basis of the corporate defense of consumer sovereignty. Thus, one is encouraged to purchase biodegradable detergents, smaller cars, white tissue paper, and similar products whose impact on the en- vironment is relatively less destructive, In turn, certain items, for exam- ple, leopard and tiger skins, become socially "taboo": movie stars dis- play their social commitment by refitting their wardrobes to conform to the latest government list of endangered species. At the other end of the cultural spectrum, whole lifestyles are planned around an intensely self- conscious effort to live, work, and love in harmony within the best inter- est of the ecosphere. Ecologically "responsible" consumption differs from purchasing which is politically or ideologically motivated chiefly in that for the former, the relationship between what is consumed (or not consumed) and the so- cial problem being addressed is direct. In the latter case, the relationship is problematic; what is at issue is not the product itself, but rather the identity of the corporation that produces it. The practical impact of either "strategy" seems minimal; it is unlikely to affect the consumption of more than a small number of citizens. Its symbolic value, however, is not so easily dismissed. By blending the roles of citizen and consumer, socially motivated consumption implicitly reinforces the awareness of the political, as well as public, dimension of business. It challenges the presumed "value-neutrality" of individual "economic" decisions by sug- gesting that nothing one does in the marketplace is free from value-laden and, therefore, political significance: ballot votes and dollar "votes" thus equally involve decisions about the balance between one's private inter- ests and the concern for the commonwealth.

The private investment of capital for financial aggrandizement is the defining characteristic of a capitalist system; it furnishes it with its raison d'etre, as well as its name. While obviously not as extensive as the market for consumer goods and services, the majority of the American population contributes, either directly through stock purchase or indirectly through financial intermediaries, to the capital requirements of American in- dustry. While the reexamination of the investment policies of churches and universities has been most visible, a number of other institutional in- vestors-including mutual funds, college retirement funds, and founda- tions-have sought to consider the social implications of their sources of wealth.55 This process has two dimensions: deciding whether to sup- port social interest proxy resolutions that might reduce company profits, and determining whether nonfinancial considerations should enter into the selection of the portfolio itself. Although a number of institutional investors, including the College Retirement Equities Fund and the Dreyfus Leverage Fund, have joined several churches and universities in voting against management on social policies, one need not be a cynic to be skeptical about the long-range impact of this development. A recent survey of universities, foundations, and churches sponsored by Business and Society Review concluded that "although these organizations are beginning to seriously consider such issues, in most organizations investment decisions are not yet signifi- cantly affected by them." 56 In an article in Harper's, entitled "Stocks Without Sin," Walter Goodman commented: "I don't know any invest- ment advisor whom I would care to have act in my behalf except turning a profit, and I'm not sure about that." 57 As with socially responsible consumption, investor conscience is dis- cussed more than it is practiced. The historical irony is, nonetheless, vivid: the marketplace, whose claim to virtue has always rested on its indifference to nonpecuniary considerations-that is, money knows no race, color, nationality, or politics-is now being asked to incorporate 55.

Once the symbol of the successful struggle of the bourgeois against the arbitrary political restrictions of the monarchy, its claim to political and social neutrality has been thoroughly undermined; increas- ingly, it is seen as a symbol of arbitrary political power. The present irony is still more glaring; social critics of the corporation are attempting to transform the market-the most impersonal, private, and competitive of social arrangements-into a vehicle for the advancement of personal, public, and cooperative ends. III D. Corporate Accountability: A third major dimension of cor- porate publicization consists in the transfer of standards of conduct and accountability from the government to the corporation. It is in this area that the publicization of the business corporation during the late sixties and early seventies emerges most clearly. The moral dimension of corporate policies has figured prominently in the political controversy of the last decade. Dow's manufacture of napalm; Honeywell's production of antipersonnel weapons; Gulf's in- vestments in Angola; and Polaroid, General Motors, and Chase Man- hattan's involvements in South Africa have generated the most intensive controversy of any business activities. In the case of war-related produc-- tion, an additional issue has been raised: corporate responsibility to war crimes under the terms of the decisions of the Nuremberg Military Tri- bunals. In presenting his case for "non-cooperation by the Honeywell Corporation with the procurement of weaponry by the United States Government in the Indochina War," 58 Richard A. Falk, Professor of International Law at Princeton University, contended that Nuremberg clearly established that corporate officials have an individual re- sponsibility for their participation in violations of international law; that this responsibility was not eliminated because the corporate officers were acting in accord with, or even in response to, govern- ment orders.59 George Wald, a Harvard University professor and Nobel laureate, ar- gued a similar point with respect to Dow Chemical's production of na- palm. He suggested that the Nuremberg Principles "be expanded so as to include the concept of corporate responsibility." 60 The application of moral criteria to corporate decisions, especially when the Nuremberg 58.

"Whistle blowing" has been the object of considerable public discus- sion in both the business and general press during the last few years.61' "Internal muckraking" is a relatively recent experience for American business. Prior to the current period of corporate criticism, detailed pub- lic accounts of corporate malpractices came largely from writers or jour- nalists employed outside the firm. Insofar as nonunion corporate em- ployees were protected from interference by management in their political activities, what was protected was their political rights as citizens, that is, election campaign contributions. The practice of whistle blowing threat- ens both these precedents; it implies that corporate employees are en- titled to the full exercise of their rights as citizens-including freedom of speech, freedom of political association, and the right to due process- in their roles as workers. The most prominent advocate of whistle blowing by corporate em- ployees is Ralph Nader. Much of Nader's most valuable information on abuses of business power, including material that formed the basis of Unsafe at Any Speed (1966), has originated from corporate informers.62 He remarked in an interview in the New York Times: "The Fisher body assembly line inspector who blew the cover on the Corvair is still on his job. The only reason is that he is a member of a labor union and thus has rights of due process." 63 Nader contends that whistle blowing repre- sents an invaluable "self-implementing mechanism to assert public con- trol over business decisions and should be encouraged by granting em- ployees of corporations the same legal protections that now protect them from state power." 64 In particular, professional employees, who make up an increasingly large segment of the work force, will then be able to assert primary allegiance to their professional code of ethics.65 61.

Also</page><page sequence="22">26 The Corporation as Government The norms of organizational loyalty are of primary importance in the corporate sector. Corporations guard their privacy jealously, treating in- formation about their triumphs and disasters as a valuable resource to be protected from the inspection of both competing firms and the gov- ernment. Company picnics, bowling leagues, and songs are merely the most obvious manifestations of an ethos of "team work," "company spirit," and "employee morale." Seen in these terms, whistle blowing by business employees is not simply disloyal; it is treasonous. The appro- priate analogy for the government might be for Fitzgerald to give the blueprint of the C5A to the Soviet Union, rather than data on its costs to a congressional committee. A corporate employee's misconduct threatens the basic purpose of the organization, namely profit. If a governmental employee "leaks" material, his superiors may be embarrassed, but the motivating principle of the institution-protection of the public interest -has not been challenged; it may even be enhanced. In addition, corporations, unlike governments, are in principle run under relatively authoritarian principles that are built into the nature of a profit making enterprise. Underground newspapers and whistle blow- ing threaten to undermine the hierarchical structure of corporate author- ity. A frequent commentator on both developments concludes: The real threat the whistle-blower presents is to the peace of mind of corporate barons. Business leaders now are insulated from pub- lic scrutiny by the ideology of private ownership: they don't have to face popular elections, as government officials do. The notion that insiders with higher loyalties will be looking over their shoul- ders does not sit well.66 A defining principle of "private" enterprise is its privacy. Unlike a democratic government, which in principle encourages careful citizen scrutiny of its policies and performance, corporations are accorded the rights of privacy granted to persons under the Fourteenth Amendment. While governmental regulatory legislation has made substantial inroads on this privilege, the presumption still falls upon the government to jus- tify each invasion; even information that the law mandates be supplied to the government is often kept confidential. The "private" status of in- formation about corporate performance is currently under attack on a variety of fronts. They include Nader's suggestions that corporation in- come tax forms be made public and the inclusion of demands for dis- Timothy Ingram, "The Corporate Underground," Nation, September 13, 1971, pp. 206-211. 66.

In addition, demands for information have been frequently raised by critics at shareholder meetings. Finally, we come to corporate challenge activities and criticisms that focus explicitly on the need to eliminate, or at least seriously reduce, the double standard of accountability that governs corporate and govern- ment authority. The Project on Corporate Responsibility (the sponsor of Campaign GM) and the Corporate Accountability Research Group (a Nader spin-off which published Corporate Power in America based on a Conference on Corporate Accountability that it organized in 1971) have been in the forefront of this effort. A sampling of the public statements of the project and CARG should suggest the self-consciousness of their campaign to subject the corporation to the public constraints that in principle apply to, the political government. But in the spring of 1970 a new tactic was adopted by some dis- senters who saw corporations to be the core of the problem. They analogized corporations to the state, and saw them as the makers of economic policy. To affect national policy, the dissenters con- cluded, required them to influence economic policy and this in turn meant that they had to work within the organizations that make such policy.67 Corporations are effectively like states, private governments with vast economic, political and social impact. A democratic society ... should not suffer such public power without public accountability. ... It makes no public sense to apply the constitution to Wyoming and West Tisbury, Mass., but not to General Motors and Standard Oil of New Jersey.68 Emerging from this corporate challenge (Campaign GM) was the notion that the corporation was like a political entity which could not rely on market mechanisms of decision-making to serve society adequately. To some, this meant that the corporate structure would have to be revamped so as to conform to democratic principles that currently apply to other political bodies.69 67. Donald E.

Ralph Nader compared the future impact of the first Campaign GM to the sit-ins. A more neutral observer described it as "The decisive event in the politicization of the corporation." 70 While public interest proxy stockholder proposals have never received more than a small fraction of the votes of outstanding shares (below five percent), the true measure of their effectiveness lies in changed public consciousness: the real battleground is the struggle to influence public opinion. The organizers have attempted to demonstrate to the public the direct connections between social problems and corpo- rate policies in a manner that conveys the public's impotence to affect business decisions under existing political and legal arrangements. Essen- tially, their tactic has been to take the notion of "shareholder" democ- racy seriously by appropriating its rituals and symbols, that is, annual "meetings," annual "elections," boards of directors as "governing" bodies for essentially critical ends. In addition, the Project imposed on this framework of corporate "democracy" another leaf from the business litany: the doctrine that management acts as if it is responsible to the interests not simply of stockholders but of employees, consumers, sup- pliers, and the general public as well. The Project thus took the corpo- rate formulation of social responsibility seriously: if management con- tends that it is responsible to various noninvestor constituencies, why then should they not also share in corporate governance? While engaging in the litany of shareholder democracy, in actuality, the Project's organizers were interested in nothing of the sort: sharehold- ers were seen as one constituency, in many ways the least subject to cor- porate power. One supporter commented: What we need is not shareholder accountability, but public account- ability. To the extent that the shareholder democracy approach confuses that distinction, it hides the real issue and is harmful. To the extent that it understands that distinction and comes out on the public side of it, it is helpful.71 Corporate reformers see shareholders as surrogate constituencies; for blacks, workers, consumers, community residents, third world peasants, etc., Campaign GM'S counsel explained, "We're trying to utilize share- 70.

The public interest proxy contest itself has, in effect, already broad- ened the corporate decision-making process. Through its solicitation of institutional investors-including universities, foundations, churches, and municipal pension funds-the performance of General Motors was de- bated in numerous public forums. Since Campaign GM's arguments were addressed not to shareholders but to the public, management was in turn forced to address its arguments to appeal to a broader constituency. In Schattschneider's terms the scope of corporate decision-making under- went a subtle, but nonetheless real, expansion: from individual share- holders and institutional investors to institutional forums that conceived of themselves as providing for the representation of the interests of the "public." 73 And as Schattschneider predicted, the terms of the debate un- derwent a corresponding transformation: the grounds on which the cor- poration's management defended its performance shifted from a virtually exclusive focus on pecuniary considerations to an emphasis on social ones; that is, safety; the control of air, water, and noise pollution, auto- motive emission control; and energy conservation. As one of the Cam- paign's leaders remarked, "At least we succeeded in changing their rhet- oric." 74 The Campaign's counsel explained this process: When corporate policy gets debated in a national forum, manage- ment's concerns must run outward. Although the public plays no formal role in the decision, management feels the need to seek their support, and address arguments which appeal to a larger audience.75 The setting for the "contest" between Campaign GM and General Motors, aside from the annual meeting itself, was the corporation's lead- ing institutional investors. By confronting shareholders with their re- sponsibilities as owners, the Campaign broke the facade of institutional neutrality under which institutional investors automatically voted in favor of management. Furthermore, the Campaign illuminated the links and financial interdependencies among the nation's leading universities, banks, and mutual funds: to trace the stock ownership of General Motors 72.

In Ralph Nader's words, "it required General Motors to surface and use its power." 77 The wide distribution of stock among the upper-middle-class "con- science constituency" has provided a tempting target to corporate re- formers. The use of investments as a vehicle for social change is ideally suited to the relatively affluent critics of American society: unlike "radi- cal chic," it is tailored to their resources and experiences rather than to their guilt. The Project on Corporate Responsibility, in an effort to cap- italize on the diversified portfolios of their potential supporters, is at- tempting to establish a mutual fund in order to provide an opportunity for large numbers of people to use their status as stockholders to ad- vance their social concerns. Almost forty years after Berle and Means, the Project seeks to revive the concept of "ownership" in an advanced capitalist society. It is seeking to persuade shareholders that their stocks are not simply "pieces of paper" entitling them to a share of company profits, but rather that corporate "ownership" involves corresponding moral and social responsibilities. One implication of this rather upside- down conception of "people's capitalism" is suggested in the following fantasy of Saul Alinsky, written shortly before his death: I want to be able to move those stockholders' meetings into Yankee Stadium.... I want to see the chairman of the board-in front of the cameras and the mass media, with 75,000 people voting "aye" on one of your resolutions-announce that 98% of the stock in his hands votes "nay" and they win. I want to see him look at 75,000 people and tell them that they haven't got a damn thing to say about it.78 IV. Analysis What is the explanation for the sudden political impact of the academic and journalistic conception of the corporation as a public institution? Our first explanation is a simple one: the conception is accurate. Since World War ii American capitalism has been characterized by the increasing integration and interdependence of the corporation and the federal government. To explore fully the dimensions of this complex set of interactions is beyond the scope of this paper. What is apparent, how- ever, is that corporations have increasingly assumed public or quasi- 76. David P. Riley, op. cit., p. 236. 77. Ibid. 78. Economic Priorities Report, (March/April, 1972), p. 5.</page><page sequence="27">David Vogel 31 public functions. As the line between "private" and "public" blurs, busi- ness corporations have greatly expanded the scope of their impact on the life-chances of individuals in the polity: profit-making firms are now en- gaged in commercial ventures in areas ranging from slum clearance to health care. The relationship between defense contractors and the De- partment of Defense has become paradigmatic for a whole range of gov- ernment-corporate relationships. "Government by contract" describes the pattern whereby corporations increasingly pursue governmental ends. Ironically, this trend has undergone a marked acceleration over the re- cent decade as corporations in response to public criticism seek to com- bine the best of both worlds, to solve social problems and make a profit. The critic's perception of the corporation as a public institution thus parallels the transformation of the corporate role already taking place on an institutional level. Corporations are increasingly public in every di- mension save that of accountability; it is this anomaly that the corpora- tion's critics seek to rectify. Since the mid-1960's, we have witnessed the successive "publiciza- tion" of two institutions: universities and corporations. The setting of protest activity has shifted from the government (1963-1967) to the university (1968-1970) and now to the business corporation (1970- present). The unions appear to be the next arena. The parallels among the modes of protest, the nature of the critics' demands, and the institu- tions' responses are striking. Both corporate and university protests be- gan with specific grievances against complicity with government prose- cution of the war in Vietnam. The debate then shifted to the issue of institutional governance; in both cases the ethnic, racial, sexual, and class composition of the nominal governing authority of the institution- the trustees and the board of directors-was publicly challenged. And each institution responded by welcoming "outsiders" to its governing body without, for the most part, affecting its structure of authority. What do these institutions, as well as unions and churches, have in common? Briefly, they constitute what is commonly referred to, in the overworked but still useful phrase, as "the establishment." It is the critics' understanding of them as functioning parts of "the system" that explains the similarities of their political experiences. The common re- sponse of both universities and corporations to the demands of protes- tors, namely that they are not responsible for the injustices they are be- ing requested to remedy, misunderstands the perception of the protestors. The criticism is both true and untrue: it is false in the sense that General Motors is to blame for the underemployment of blacks in Detroit or Columbia University for the war in Vietnam. On the other hand, as working units of the establishment," each of them is responsible for</page><page sequence="28">32 The Corporation as Government everything. In this sense, it does not really matter to which institution demands for social change are addressed. With some obvious exceptions such as hiring discrimination or pollution, each institution is held equally accountable for all social "problems." The organizational division of labor in "the system," according to this perspective, is simply a matter for the efficiency of the bourgeoisie; it has relatively little to do with the distribution of power and responsibility. The second part of the explanation for the recent focus of critics and protestors on the business corporation is rather less sophisticated. It is simply that for many reasons corporations offer a convenient and vul- nerable target. Unlike the government, corporations were relatively in- experienced in dealing with direct citizen pressure. Like university ad- ministrators, executives were caught off guard by the sudden public interest in the performance and governance of their institutions. A pam- phlet published by the Conference Board in 1971 offers a revealing in- dication of both the novelty and diversity of the tactics with which busi- ness felt it had to be prepared to deal.7" The very authoritarianism of business also makes it an inviting target. Critics can easily determine who exercises authority within a business and thus who is personally responsible for particular policies. A top executive, by virtue of the hierarchical structure of the firm, has the power to "follow through" on promises to critics, which is denied many university officials and politi- cians.80 Each of the corporation's constituencies-government, the public, in- stitutional and private investors, employees, neighbors, consumers, and suppliers-defines its power as well as its vulnerability. The diversity of the tactics sketched in this article-consumer boycotts, picketing, dis- ruption of business meetings, occupation of company headquarters, strikes, harassment of recruiters, class action suits, press conferences, research studies-should suggest the extent to which any corporation, even the largest and most powerful, is vulnerable to persistent and imag- inative pressure tactics. In addition, businessmen have a tendency, noted by Dickens a century ago, to exaggerate and overreact to criticism. Their often excessive concern with their "image" has been openly ex- ploited by their contemporary critics. The most novel feature of criticisms of business during the recent decade is the equal hostility of its critics to the government. If there is any institution whose prestige and legitimacy has declined over the last 79. Handling Protests at Annual Meetings (New York: The Conference Board, 1971). 80.

Social- ists, radicals, and liberals increasingly share a skepticism about the ef- fectiveness of governmental programs and policies. Accordingly, would-be corporate reformers are faced with a dilemma: if increased governmental regulation is considered ineffective, what polit- ical mechanisms are appropriate for making corporations publicly ac- countable? The proposal that has received the greatest attention is Ralph Nader's suggestion that the federal government charter corporations. While federal chartering of corporations is not exactly a household issue, it has generated a fair amount of serious interest and public discussion.,' The idea flows from Nader's dictum that "power, . . . if it's going to be responsible, has got to be insecure." 82 To require federal chartering of all corporations larger than a certain specified size would enable reform- ers to rewrite the "social contract" between the citizenry and business. While specific proposals vary, most of them see the federal charters as establishing political and legal mechanisms to encourage extensive direct citizen participation in corporate decisions.83 In essence, Nader proposes a system that would be self-regulating: its effectiveness would depend not on government officials or the integrity of businessmen but on citi- zens acting in the role of guardians of the public interest. The "public citizen" would become a third force in American life, increasing public accountability without a corresponding increase in public bureaucracy. Nader's solution to the crisis of corporate legitimacy is thus clear: the corporation would be legally transformed into a public institution, sub- ject to all the political and legal constraints of the public government as well as several additional economic ones, including public and "special interest" representation on the board of directors, greatly increased dis- closure requirements, the personal liability of directors for corporate misconduct, and the protection of the right of employees to speak pub- licly on company affairs.84 81.

Classical liberal ideology rested on a fundamental dichotomy between what was public and what was private, between politics and economics, and between government and business. While these distinctions are considerably less rigid in 1973 than they were in 1873, they remain important to both the ideology and practice of American capitalism. The current deluge of corporate social responsibility pronouncements notwithstanding, most businessmen still consider the corporation essentially an economic institution: the most efficient production and distribution of goods and services defines its purpose and the "bottom line" measures its achievement. The doctrine of corporate social responsibility, with all its recognition of the social impact of business performance, still fails to challenge the "private" na- ture of corporate power. What the corporate challenge movement does is to criticize the incongruity of the pattern of authority of the business corporation and the liberal democratic state.85 Fathers, lords, kings, and other heads of nonrepublican institutions are presumably supposed to be "responsible"; mayors, presidents, and prime ministers are held to a more exacting standard: they are supposed to be "accountable." In poli- tics, as in sex, the "double standard" is now articulated less clearly, but practiced just as consistently. For the most part, the only criticisms of the corporation that have had substantial public support challenge the performance of the corporation. Such criticism, primarily in the consumer and environmental areas, con- stitutes no more than a temporary inconvenience to corporate managers. With appropriate governmental assistance, reasonable legal regulations, and sufficient public patience, it is likely to have no long-term serious impact on corporate profits or on the distribution of power and privilege within the corporate system. Criticism of business that challenges, either implicitly or explicitly, the status of the corporation as a "private," pre- dominantly economic institution constitutes a much more serious poten- tial challenge to the nation's major business corporations. By addressing itself not so much to what business does as to what it is, it raises a whole series of questions about the structure of authority within the firm as well as the justifications for the power of the corporation in the society. ectors," Business and Society Review (Spring, 1972), pp. 69-70; Phillip Blumberg, "Who Belongs on Corporate Boards?"

We can distinguish three distinct interpretations of American politics: pluralist, populist, and Marxist. The first acknowledges the governmental nature of private associations and institutions but regards their respective scopes as either limited or competitive: none of them enjoys a prepon- derance of power. The populist perspective sees one or more institutions exerting a critical impact on the distribution of power and privilege in the society. Although the most popular populist villain is business or "the interests," other institutions are also seen as part of the contempo- rary "organizational society": universities, unions, foundations, profes- sional associations. Populism focuses on two political actors: the indi- vidual and the organization. The impotence of the individual in the face of the massive institutional fabric of an advanced technological society and the impersonal nature of bureaucratic authority constitute its prin- cipal themes. Socialists, on the other hand, regard the corporation not simply as another powerful institution or even the most powerful but rather as the institution that sets the parameters within which all other institutions, including the government, function. According to this per- spective, to regard the corporation along with the government, the uni- versity, labor union, and foundations as a "political" or even "public" institution is to obscure the distinctive and unique rule of the corpora- tion in a capitalist system: it creates the "surplus" that allows all other institutions and organizations to function. In spite of the participation of some New Left and Marxist organiza- tions in the corporate challenge movement, its basic thrust is clearly populist; it does not challenge the logic of a system organized around the imperatives of profit-maximization.86 While often recognizing the in- terpenetration of the state and the corporation, it does not question the dynamics of capitalism, which are leading to an identical pattern of in- tegration in every capitalist nation. Because the hegemony of the market is not challenged, its imperatives define the potential political limitations of the current challenge to the corporation. If profit-maximization, how- ever loosely defined, remains essential for the survival of the firm, it may make only a marginal difference how democratic or republican it be- comes. David Rockefeller might stand for regular public elections along with his brother, and the structure of General Motors could begin to evoke memories of Athens at the time of Pericles. But how long would either the Chase Manhattan Bank N.A. or GM remain solvent? What 86.

These are critical questions and the corporate challenge movement has for the most part ignored them. The limitations of the populist challenge to the corporation are of in- terest to both businessmen and socialists. The former frequently voice the concern that the imposition of too many social demands on business will, in the words of the corporate secretary of General Motors, "Kill the goose that lays the golden eggs." 87 As long as social responsibility is compatible with corporate profits, the problem is moot. It is when the demands for corporate accountability begin to threaten the solvency of a firm or industry that the limitations of the movement become apparent. Socialists fear that unless the market share of firms is stabilized by law, the legal publicization of the corporation will have limited impact on corporate conduct. Some radical research groups are currently attempt- ing to go beyond the policy suggestions of the corporate challenge move- ment to suggest ways of organizing the economy which rely neither on centralized planning nor on the market.88 They face a formidable chal- lenge. What is the likely impact of the current movement to publicize the corporation? It has clearly had an effect on the decisions of a number of firms. While we lack a comprehensive inventory of its concrete accom- plishments, a few are evident: Dow Chemical no longer produces na- palm, American Telephone and Telegraph Company has upgraded the position of its female employees, Kodak agreed to hire unskilled blacks, the conditions of farm workers has been improved, and both the paper- mill and steel industries have been pressured to accelerate the introduc- tion of pollution control equipment. The "social environment" has be- come a critical input into corporate planning.89 This list, sketchy as it is, suggests that corporations are not as invul- nerable or insensitive as many of their critics depict them. On the other hand, it does not reveal any important political changes in the nature of decision-making within the corporation. We suggest that the chief significance of the movement is ideological; its accomplishments are best measured not by its "victories" or "defeats" 87.

To the extent that the mechanisms of public participation and accountability that are increasingly revealing their inadequacy in the governmental sphere are transferred unchanged to the corporate sector, the democratzation of the American political system will suffer only marginal improvement. Alter- natively, if critics of the corporation are able to profit from their frus- trated direct assault on the corporation and begin to confront the para- dox of a publicly accountable corporation in a profit system, they will be challenging the legitimacy, not only of the management of the corpora- tion, but of the capitalist system as a whole. Neither outcome appears very probable.</page></plain_text>
