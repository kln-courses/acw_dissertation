<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 7 How old is X-ray art? Minimum age  determinations for early X-ray rock art  from the ‘Red Lily’ (Wulk) Lagoon rock  art precinct, western Arnhem Land Tristen Jones, Vladimir Levchenko and Daryl Wesley Introduction A central and fundamental issue in rock art research is where the art is placed in space and time  (David et al. 2013). Discovering and applying new techniques to understand motif styles and  their chronology will provide us with this information. Here we use a ‘cabled’ methodology  (see Chippindale and Taçon 1998:93), where multiple lines of evidence are developed together,  by combining absolute and relative dating techniques. Absolute radiocarbon dates are made on  two different substances that have been related with relative dates derived by assessing motif  superimpositions, the stylistic analysis of motifs and degrees of preservation. Combined, the  absolute and relative methods provide reliable dates for the painted motifs on a rock art panel at  Red Lily Lagoon Site 3 (see Figure 2.1). Radiocarbon dates were obtained for mineral accretions  suspected to contain the minerals whewellite and whedellite (both are hydrated forms of calcium  oxalate CaC2O4, and called hereafter ‘calcium oxalate’), and from preserved non-reactive organics  contained within ancient mud wasp nest stumps. This is the first attempt to apply radiocarbon  dating to these two different materials, calcium oxalate and mud wasp nests, directly associated  with the same rock art. A combination of radiocarbon dating and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating  on mud wasp nests has proved fruitful in dating rock art in the Kimberley (see Roberts et al.  1997). A previous Australian study used radiocarbon determinations for a calcium oxalate crust  encasing rockfall within excavated deposits. Those results were compared with radiocarbon ages  for charcoal samples in the same stratigraphic units (Watchman et al. 2005). These studies show  the potential of both calcium oxalate and mud wasp nests for radiocarbon dating of rock art.  While both calcium oxalate and mud wasp nest samples each have limitations for radiocarbon  dating (cf. Aubert 2012; Bednarik 1996, 2000, 2002, 2007; David et al. 2013; Gillespie 1997;  Rosenfeld and Smith 1997), our study has found that multiple radiocarbon age determinations  from these two different substances can together generate robust dates for rock art.  </page> <page sequence="2"> 130    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Red Lily Lagoon Site 3 Red Lily (Wulk) is a coastal freshwater lagoon within the vast floodplains of the East Alligator  River catchment area. The lagoon is found c. 5 km northeast of Cahill’s Crossing on the  main Oenpelli Road (Figure 2.1). The region falls within the territory of the Gagudju/Erre/ Mangereridju language group, and forms part of the Manilakarr clan estate. Red Lily Lagoon  is bordered on its eastern side by the western Arnhem Land Proterozoic Kombolgie Sandstone  massif. This most western section of the plateau converges with Red Lily Lagoon, and the adjacent  Kakadu wetlands, as a steep escarpment, varying in elevation from 50 m to 400 m above sea  level (ASL). The floodplains that surround the escarpment are annually inundated, re-filling permanent  lagoons and billabongs, and at times submersing the majority of the land surface. It is within  this landscape that the major archaeological site complex of Red Lily is situated (for a more  comprehensive environmental and historical background for Red Lily Lagoon, see Chapter 2). Red Lily Lagoon Site 3 is situated on top of the plateau at an approximate elevation of 70 m  ASL, 700 m west of Red Lily Lagoon. The site is a major sandstone rock stack. On all sides of the  rock stack, intensive weathering has generated deep overhanging shelters with rock floors, some  with shallow sandy deposits, and isolated sandstone boulders. (For a description of the formation  of rockshelters in Arnhem Land’s quartzitic sandstone stacks, see Chapter 13.) Each side of the rock stack is reported as a separate section, termed Areas A–D; each is a distinct  and  major rock art shelter in its own right. As field time was limited, all art panels were  mapped, but not all individual motifs recorded. Overall, the Red Lily Site 3 rockshelters contain  over 700 rock art images in a range of different art styles. These span the Early, Middle and  Late periods outlined in Chippindale and Taçon’s regional stylistic chronology (Chippindale  and Taçon 1998:107). For example, rock art includes hand and foot stencils, ‘Large Naturalistic’  figures, Northern Running/Mountford figures, early X-ray and representations of the Complete  Figure Style, including stick-figures, simple energetic figures, full figures and recent X-ray figures.  There is also European contact–period imagery. Painting methods, forms and pigment types  are variable. Motifs range from full-bodied, intricately detailed figurative representations of  animals, applied with fine brushwork, to rudimentary-lined human figures. Pigment colours  include red, orange, black, white and yellow, with many complex images bichromatic or  polychromatic. Notable motifs include four painted in Reckitt’s Blue pigment in Area B, and a  high number of hand, forearm and foot stencils in Area C. Reckitt’s Blue is the commercial name  given to a laundry product used to whiten clothing (Chaloupka 1993:84). The use of Reckitt’s  Blue as  a paint was first reported in the Alligator Rivers region in 1912 by Baldwin Spencer  (1928:831). Chaloupka (1993:84) suggests that the blue pigment found widespread use after the  introduction of Reckitt’s Blue by Oenpelli missionaries in 1925. The panel here studied is in Area D (Figure 7.1). Area D consists of three panels, with Panel 2  containing the majority of rock art images. The rock wall surface, facing northwest, measures  6 m in width by 1.2 m in height. The rock surface is well sheltered from the elements, with the  dripline more than 1 m from the panel surface. However, the condition of the panel is quite  poor: it is affected by both mud wasp nests and termites; mineral crusts and some parts of the  rock face are spalling. The recording team perceive about 40 highly weathered rock paintings,  some superimposed on the rock wall. Nonetheless, some images, and a basic sequence of  superimposition of the clearest motifs on the rock wall, can be deciphered (Figure 7.2). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="3"> 7.

It spans much of the rock  wall. Parts of the motif are solid infilled with protruding lines that are suggestive of spines.  The motif spans left to right, across and down the rock surface. It is unknown where this motif  lies in the relative sequence of artworks on this panel. The image is not clear enough to determine  its exact shape, or indeed its corresponding style. The ‘spines’ are reminiscent of those common  in ‘Yam’-style Rainbow Serpents (Taçon et al. 1996). The image is superimposed by others,  as outlined below. Motif 2 Motif 2, in the upper left-hand section of the panel, is a red unidentifiable animal with hind  limbs and the remnants of a tail. It is delineated by a solid line and decorated with the linear  infill characteristic of ‘Large Naturalistic’ figures (Chaloupka 1993:94). Motif 2 overlies Motif 1. Motif 3 Motif 3, the predominant image on the panel, is the best preserved. It is a red-outlined bichrome  S-shaped motif, clearly depicting a snake. The motif is large, measuring 110 cm in length and  90 cm in width. The red pigment is better preserved than the yellow. The head of the snake is  segmented, and is red and solid. Throughout the length of the body, a solid red segment also  features, outlined by yellow pigment on either side. Starting from the head of the snake, two  parallel red-lined segments following the curved S-shape of the snake border the main solid  infill. The decoration features areas of solid infill, creating a block yellow to red patterning.  This feature is lost throughout most of the snake’s body due to weathering. There are also early  X-ray features, such as a characteristic main body cavity with a thick line running through it  representing a backbone (e.g. Taçon 1989: Figure 18; see Figure 7.3). Motif 3 overlies Motif 2. Figure 7.3 Early X-ray attributes, some of which are depicted in Motif 3. Source: Taçon 1989: Figure 18, reproduced with permission. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="5"> 7.  How old is X-ray art?    133  Motif 4 The topmost layer in the painting sequence is comprised of a white anthropomorphic figure.  Extensive weathering has resulted in only part of the motif remaining on the rock wall, that  of the head and upper body. The bichrome figure consists of a red outline, infilled with white  pigment. The figure is depicted in profile, as is common in human-like representations, with the  head a hollowed C-shape. Chaloupka (1993:148–149) refers to such depictions as ‘hooked face’  figures. These types of human figures have been categorised as part of the ‘Complete Figure Style’  (Taçon 1992:204–205). Motif 4 overlies Motif 3.  Style and preservation as indicators of antiquity  For many decades, rock art researchers have utilised the method of grouping rock art motifs into  ‘styles’ or manners of depiction, creating a relative sequence of change in artistic depiction over  time. For western Arnhem Land, the original stylistic sequence proposed by George Chaloupka in  various publications, including his hallmark Journey in Time (Chaloupka 1993:89), was modified  and further developed by Chippindale and Taçon (1998:107), which is referenced in this study.  The classification of motifs according to style at Red Lily Lagoon Site 3 Area D Panel 2 is  problematic. While the shape of Motif 1 is uncertain, the presence of spines suggesting  a  backbone  signals some kind of zoomorph. While the decorative attribute of spines has  previously been categorised as typifying ‘early X-ray’ art (Figure 7.3), the spines feature on the  outside of the painting. Therefore the spines are more likely to indicate decorative features seen  in ‘Yam’-style Rainbow Serpents (Taçon et al. 1996). Taçon (1989) defines the internal attributes  that constitute the ‘early X-ray’ style (see Figure 7.3), some of which are present in Motif 1, but  also occur in Motif 3 of Panel 2.  Motif 2 is a depiction of a naturalistic macropod, as the motif is drawn with a free-flowing  outline and is textured with linear infill (Chaloupka 1993:94). Chaloupka’s categorisation of  ‘Large Naturalistic’ animals as one discrete category of painting type that only appears at the  beginning of the Arnhem Land sequence is inaccurate. Lewis succinctly summarises the issue  as follows: ‘The style of large naturalistic animals and humans is ill-defined and it may actually  consist of a number of similar styles present throughout the entire sequence of Arnhem Land art’  (1988:72). Indeed, the depictions of large animals are very common, many researchers having  identified paintings in a ‘Large Naturalistic’ manner throughout the entire sequence, particularly  throughout the Early and Intermediate period (cf. the Large Fauna Style of Chippindale and  Taçon 1998).  The predominant motif in Panel 2 – Motif 3 – is a large snake. This motif is better preserved  than any other rock painting on the panel. The segmentation of the head and the inclusion  of both solid and patterned infilled segments clearly denote this image as an X-ray painting.  The X-ray painting tradition has been argued to span some 8000 years (Taçon 1989, 1992), and  therefore the categorisation of the motif according to ‘style’ does not provide a high resolution  age estimation for the motif. The use of two colours, red and yellow in combination, suggests that  the motif may have been painted in the late Holocene. Instances of bichromatic early X-ray are  uncommon, accounting for only 5.7 per cent of the total number of paintings recorded by Taçon  (1989:121–122). On the other hand, in recent X-ray art, which Taçon (1989:124) defines as  occurring from 3000 BP to present, bichromatic representations are the most common, making  up 60.2 per cent of the samples. Additionally, the combination of red and yellow pigment is  the second-most popular extant pigment combination after red and white in recent X-ray rock  art (Taçon 1989:126). Differentiation of motifs as either early or recent X-ray in style may also  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="6"> 134    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia rely on the subject matter of the motif. Many researchers have argued that changes in faunal  depictions through time signal changing environmental conditions (Chaloupka 1993:88).  Taçon rightly notes that freshwater animal species begin to predominate in early X-ray paintings.  As such, the commencement of early X-ray art is thought by many researchers to correspond  with mid to late Holocene environmental conditions, such as are evident in the Kakadu wetlands  of today (Brockwell 1996; Taçon and Brockwell 1995). As the subject matter of Motif 3 is  formally a generic depiction of a snake, and as snakes are known to exist in both wet and dry  environments, the faunal taxon cannot itself be used as an indicator of the painting’s age. The  snake’s depiction in this instance does not have any characteristic features of a ‘Rainbow Serpent’.  Rainbow Serpents are commonly depicted with elaborately detailed tails, and plant and animal  appendages, macropod-like heads and cross-hatching decorative features (Taçon et al. 1996).  Motif 3 does not feature any of these attributes.  ‘Indirect’ dating methods place Motif 4 in the late Holocene. While the full diversity of human- like representations in western Arnhem Land art remains a topic of ongoing research (Chippindale  and Taçon 1993), the attribute of a hooked face, or C-shaped head, is akin to the facial features  of ‘Energetic’ stick-figures. ‘Energetic’ stick-figures are commonly depicted in the rock art record  of the wider Red Lily Lagoon area. Typically, these figures are frequently painted with material  culture, particularly weaponry (Chaloupka 1993:148–149). The presence of weaponry in rock  art paintings has previously been used as an indicator of the relative age of depictions (Lewis  1988). However, poor preservation of the painting has eliminated any potential evidence of  material culture, and as such cannot be used to assist in estimating the age of Motif 4. It is  assumed that the condition is due to the fact that the motif is painted in white pigment, which  is acknowledged to have the least permanency of all pigment types perhaps apart from charcoal  (Chippindale and Taçon 1998:103–104). According to Taçon, ‘Energetic’ stick-figures are a sub- category of the ‘Complete Figure Style’. This style incorporates many different forms of art,  including ‘full figures’, ‘stick-figures’, stencils, beeswax images and prints. Taçon (1992:204–206)  argues that the ‘Complete Figure Style’ co-existed with ‘Recent X-Ray’ and is assigned an age  range from 3000–2000 BP to present. On this basis, we assume that Motif 4 was painted during  this period and has a maximum age of 3000 BP. Sample selection and methodology The rock surfaces and panels of Area D were surveyed for radiocarbon sampling, with particular  attention concentrated on the white accretions and mud wasp nests present along sections of  the rock wall. The presence of a mineral coating possibly containing calcium oxalate (whewellite  CaC2O4.H2O and weddellite CaC2O4.2H2O) was identified and in areas the whitish growth was  covering part of Motif 3. Additionally, remnants of an ancient mud wasp nest were also present  in close proximity to the mineral crust and located adjacent to Motif 3 (Figures 7.4 and 7.5).  Three samples of coating material were collected from the rock surface (Sample 3-4-1, Sample  3-4-2 and Sample 3-4-3) (Figures 7.4 and 7.5). Sample 3-4-1 is of the mineral accretion that  overlies part of Motif 3. The accretion covers the red and yellow segment patterning depicted  in the upper neck of the snake (Figure 7.5). Sample 3-4-2 is from the remnant mud wasp nest.  The mud wasp nest is situated adjacent to the right of the main body of the snake painting  (Figure 7.5). Sample 3-4-3 is a mineral accretion that overlies the red outline of the mid-body of  the snake painting (Figure 7.4). All samples were removed using a diamond disk Dremel® drill,  producing bulk crust removal in powdered form. Powder was captured in clean individual sheets  of aluminium foil, and emptied into clean centrifuge tubes.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="7"> 7.

Samples were registered and weighed,  and aliquots taken from those expected to be of oxalate origin (RLL3-4-1 and RLL3-4-3).  Aliquots were sent to The Australian National University’s (ANU) Research School of Earth  Sciences laboratories to test for the presence of calcium oxalate using Fourier Transform Infrared  Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The latter two mineralogical methods did  not detect calcium oxalate suggesting that any oxalate that might be present was below the level  of a few per cent. Additionally, the FTIR and XRD results confirmed the presence of minor  phosphates (tinsleyite, taranakite), sulfate (gypsum) and natural weathering products such as  amorphous materials, quartz and mica/kaolinite. The samples from Red Lily 3 have comparable  mineral compositions to other rock art dating samples analysed from the study area (King et  al. 2017) Sample RLL3-4-1 was processed at ANSTO. The sample was pre-treated to remove potential  carbon-bearing contaminants according to the following procedure. The powdered material was  placed in a centrifuge tube with excess of 5 per cent NaOH solution at 60°C for one hour.  At this step, various organic acids and non-acid soluble paint solids were transferred into the  solution. Solution was centrifuged and the supernates decanted and retained in case of further  analysis. After rinsing with Milli-Q® water, the samples were treated with 6M HCl at 60°C,  to remove possible carbonates and to dissolve whewellite and whedellite minerals. After one  hour, the solution was centrifuged and supernates decanted and saved. This time the precipitates,  possibly containing various more or less inert solids (silica, pollen, charcoal, some non-reactive  organic matter) were retained for separate analyses; these are referred to as the ‘residue’ in this  chapter. The decanted solutions containing oxalic and HCl acids and their salts were dried down  (HCl  volatilises), sealed in quartz combustion tubes and combusted at 900°C, as described  elsewhere (Hua et al. 2001). Separate residue fractions were rinsed in Milli-Q® water multiple  times, dried and also sealed in combustion tubes and correspondingly combusted in the same  conditions. Evolved CO2 was cryogenically purified and collected and its yield determined. Then  it was converted to graphite following standard graphitisation procedures (Hua et al. 2004). Sample RLL3-4-2, the remnants of the mud wasp nest, was pre-treated at ANSTO following  standard ABA procedures (Hatté et al. 2001). As per the following, the weighed powder  was placed  in a centrifuge tube and treated with 2M HCl for two hours at 60°C, followed  after centrifuging by multiple Milli-Q® rinses. The next step included multiple treatments of  0.5 per cent up to 10 per cent NaOH for 2 hours each at 60°C (until two consecutive treatment  solutions remained clear). After another Milli-Q® rinse, the third step consisted of 2M HCl  at room temperature overnight and multiple Milli-Q® rinses until a near-neutral pH of the  solution was achieved. The sample was oven-dried at 60°C. This treatment effectively removes  all carbonates, humic and fulvic acids, fats and lipids, leaving behind pollen, charcoal dust (soot)  and possible powdered macrofossils material. The dried sample was placed in a sealed quartz  combustion tube similar to the oxalate sample, combusted to CO2, which was again cryogenically  purified and collected and converted to graphite. Graphite targets were pressed into aluminium cathodes, and the 12C/14C ratio determined on  ANSTO’s STAR and ANTARES accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) installations (Fink et al.  2004). In parallel with real samples, a set of chemistry procedural blanks was prepared to determine  the level of possible contamination through the preparation process and corrected for this in data  evaluations. Smaller samples are more likely to be contaminated, resulting in relatively large error  bars of radiocarbon determinations for the smallest sample sizes. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="9"> 7.  How old is X-ray art?    137  Determinations of δ13C were done on the residue of graphite targets derived from the studied  fractions after the radiocarbon measurements were completed. Measurements were performed on  a separate elemental analyser Elementar varioMICRO CUBE coupled to a Micromass Isoprime  IRMS machine. If graphite residues were too small for a measurement, the average value for the  same type of samples from the area was used for isotope fractionation correction. Radiocarbon age determinations  The radiocarbon calibrated age determinations of the calcium oxalate and mud wasp nest samples  fall within c. 210 years between their median values. They both indicate an early to mid-Holocene  age of somewhere between 5068 cal BP and 6636 cal BP, taking the 95.5 per cent probability  calibrated age ranges into account (Table 7.1). That the ages of two different dated material types  converge – calcium oxalate and the mud wasp nest – is very encouraging. Each of these sample  types has a different kind of formation history, has been subject to different pre-treatments and  has a different dated fraction. This suggests the robustness of radiocarbon method for both of the  dated materials, particularly in the utilisation of calcium oxalate minerals for radiocarbon dating.

The value of δ13C is assumed from determinations of similar type samples. A measured value  is not available due to the small size of samples. For explanations of two dated fractions for mineral crust sample, see text. Source: Authors’ data.  In this study, we have reported two radiocarbon age determinations for sample RLL3-4-1. The  first date is produced from the carbon contained within the calcium oxalate mineral only, isolated  in sample pre-treatment. The second radiocarbon age determination is produced from the mineral  crust residues (inert solids such as silica, pollen, charcoal, some non-reactive organic matter)  contained within the sample. The calcium oxalate mineral crust returned an age of 5068–6636  cal BP, which, judging by the median age probability, precedes the mud wasp nest formation  on the rock wall by a few centuries (Table 7.1). The calcium oxalate mineral crust has produced  the oldest age, and as such it can be considered the terminus ante quem for the underlying snake  image (Motif 3). The radiocarbon determination for the calcium oxalate sample was produced  as a bulk measurement. Therefore all calcium oxalate mineral deposits that relate to mineral  formation events and are stratified temporally in the crust have been combined into one sample.  Hence, the produced age of the calcium oxalate represents an averaged result.  The mineral crust residue radiocarbon age – 4445–5446 cal BP – is determined from the carbon  contaminates contained within and on the mineral crust (Table 7.1). The younger age of the  residue may be due to the continual integration of carbon contaminants throughout the growth  history of the crust, in conjunction with a build-up of carbon pollutants on the rock surface.  Mineral crusts are known to grow sporadically over a period of time dependent on micro- terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="10"> 138    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia environmental conditions. Considering the age spread between the coating minerals and the  mineral crust residue, we can assume that the calcium oxalate mineral has been growing over  a considerable length of time (Hassiba et al. 2012). The radiocarbon age determination for the mud wasp nest is 5605–5875 cal BP (Table 7.1). This  date is interpreted as representing the moment of mud wasp nest construction, as the organic  components, such as pollen, spores, phytoliths and charcoal dust, are gathered and integrated  into the structure of the nest by mud dauber wasps during the construction process (Bednarik  2014; Roberts et al. 1997). While some mud dauber wasps prefer to construct nests on the  remnants of pre-existing nests, visual inspection upon sampling the mud wasp nest residue in the  field indicated that in this instance there was only a single nest-building event. Therefore, carbon  age averaging from multiple nest-building events is unlikely. Contrary to the calcium oxalate  sample, the mud-wasp nest does not overlie Motif 3 or Motif 4. The mud wasp nest is located  adjacent to the snake motif. As the mud wasp nest is younger than the calcium oxalate crust,  it must have developed on the rock surface after the painting of Motif 3. Discussion A paucity of chronometric ages directly dating rock art remains an ongoing issue in rock art  research worldwide (Aubert 2012; David et al. 2013). In Australia, a recent review of direct dates  revealed that while there is a substantial number of age determinations for rock art, particularly  in the Northern Territory (244 age determinations accounting for 56.4 per cent of the national  data-set), the majority (74 per cent) of the age determinations are from beeswax rock art designs  (Langley and Taçon 2010). The ages produced from beeswax figures are predominately of late  Holocene antiquity; indeed, 81 per cent of the age determinations generated from beeswax  samples in the Northern Territory are less than 500 years old (Langley and Taçon 2010).  The predominance of chronometric age determinations from beeswax motifs is largely due to  the fact that the material generally contains the most 14C for radiocarbon dating. Additionally,  dating beeswax motifs produces age determinations for the actual art object and the material is  far less likely to be affected by carbon contamination, carbon recycling and sampling issues that  plague the use of calcium oxalate and mud wasp nest substances for radiocarbon dating (Bednarik  2012). Langley and Taçon (2010:71) conclude of western Arnhem Land: ‘The dominance of  dated beeswax figures in this region means that while the chronology of this medium is now  quite well understood, three remaining media (paintings, engravings and cupules) remain largely  disarticulated from a regional chronology’.  Concerns in the literature regarding the use of calcium oxalate minerals for radiocarbon dating  rock art have focused on the unclear nature of the mineral’s developmental pathway, the unknown  rate of mineral formation and the technical sample processing limitations in the separation of  carbon-bearing components. These issues have previously stalled the widespread use of calcium  oxalate as a substance for radiocarbon dating and acceptance of published radiocarbon age  determinations generated from calcium oxalate minerals. The sample preparation methodology  utilised in this study is a novel carbon compound-specific separation technique, which effectively  isolates the carbon compound in the calcium oxalate minerals in sample pre-treatment (refer to  methodology above). The result is two separate age determinations produced from the calcium  oxalate mineral and the carbon ‘residues’ contained within the mineral crust. The residue carbon  is assumed to be integrated into the formation of the mineral growth throughout the mineral  crust’s life span, and may also incorporate carbon pollutants residing on the mineral crust’s  surface. The refinement of this sampling procedure and the ramifications for the interpretation of  radiocarbon age determinations is the subject of ongoing research and will be discussed in future  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="11"> 7.  How old is X-ray art?    139  publications (Jones et al. 2017). For this study, however, the considerably younger age of the  mineral crust residue is proposed to be a result of the continuing build-up of carbon pollutants  on the crust’s surface. While the calcium oxalate mineral crust at some unknown point in time  ceased growing, accumulation of carbon pollutants has remained ongoing to the present day.  The younger age of the mineral crust residue demonstrates the efficiency of the sampling pre- treatment cleaning procedures and compound-specific isolation method employed in this study.  Previous radiocarbon age determinations using traditional acid-base-acid (ABA) sampling  pre-treatment techniques may have failed to remove some carbon contaminants present  in calcium oxalate mineral crust samples, such as charcoal dust, pollen, etc. This previously  unresolved reliable pre-treatment issue has been the cause of much of the critique of the calcium  oxalate radiocarbon dating results. The radiocarbon age determinations produced in this study  highlight the potentially significant impact that carbon pollutants can have on radiocarbon age  determinations. In this example, it can be assumed that without the separation of the mineral  crust residues from the calcium oxalate, the mineral crust radiocarbon age determination would  have been significantly younger. Recent discussions in rock art dating have noted the rich organics contained within mud wasp  nests, and their suitability for radiocarbon dating has remained an under-exploited resource in  rock art dating (Bednarik 2014). While previous studies have assessed radiocarbon ages from  organics within mud wasp nests in comparison to OSL ages (Roberts et al. 1997, 2000), the  potential to exploit other methods, such as calcium oxalate radiocarbon dating, for comparative  analysis in determining age estimations for rock art has been identified as a growing area of  research (Bednarik 2014). The fact remains that problems persist for all ‘direct’ dating methods  in rock art research, placing significant constraints on our ability to generate chronometric age  estimates for rock art. However, while we have only presented three age determinations in this  study, the results demonstrate that robust age determinations using both radiocarbon dating  approaches can be produced. The resolution of questions surrounding the validity of methods  in this case is in the combination of multiple radiocarbon age determinations generated from  different substances. This methodology has been suggested previously on many occasions by  rock art researchers (e.g. Bednarik 2012). In this instance, generating age determinations from  multiple sources also lends weight to the potential of dating both calcium oxalate and mud  wasp nests, and advocates for the ongoing adoption of both approaches. It also highlights the  substantial opportunity for rock art researchers to date both materials more frequently, due to the  common occurrence of both calcium oxalate mineral accretions and mud wasp nests overlying  rock art in northern Australia. The radiocarbon ages indicate that the minimum age (median probability) for the snake painting  (Motif 3) is 5906 cal BP (Table 7.1). The painting has been interpreted as being of the early X-ray  style, due to the presence of linear and segmented infill features. These decorative features are  highlighted by the use of yellow and red pigments. While the poor preservation of both Motif 1  and Motif 2 render it difficult for a complete description to be established for either motif, they  must be older than Motif 3 as they occur beneath it. According to Chippindale and Taçon’s stylistic regional chronology, early X-ray style is positioned  between the Intermediate and Late period, and is assumed to appear c. 6000 years ago, co-existing  with ‘Simple Figures’, ‘Yam Figures’, ‘Large Human’ and ‘Large Fauna’ styles. The radiocarbon  age determinations produced in this study supports the assumed ages for this art style in the  relative regional chronology. Furthermore, our new age determinations complement the previous  proposition by Taçon (1989:119, 1992:203), who, by utilising motif superimpositions and  stylistic analysis, estimated an upper age limit for the introduction of the early X-ray technique  to between 8000–6000 BP. His reasoning for this time frame was the existence of early X-ray  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="12"> 140    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia attributes appearing underneath the ‘Yam’ and ‘Simple Figures with Boomerang’ styles, while  acknowledging that the upper age limit may be open to further investigation. It is important to  note that the radiocarbon age of Sample 3-4-1 is a minimum age for the underlying painting, as  the calcium oxalate mineral crust overlies the snake painting (Motif 3). The age gap between the  Motifs 1–3 painting events, and both the growth of the calcium oxalate mineral crust and mud  wasp nest, are not known and the actual painting event may have taken place many years before.  Most rock art researchers have discussed the problems associated with generating age estimates  for rock art by employing indirect dating methods. Yet in-depth discussions addressing the  implications of underestimating style age ranges has been missing in the literature to date. The  radiocarbon age determinations produced in this study demonstrate that X-ray attributes occur  in rock art motifs from the mid-Holocene. In fact, they may potentially occur much earlier. In  this instance, the painted rock art surface (Panel 2) occurring at Red Lily Lagoon Site 3 is well  protected from environmental decay, particularly water erosion. The dripline above Panel 2 is  at some points nearly 2 m from the painted rock wall, providing a micro-environment that has  produced greater conservation outcomes than normally would occur at other rock art sites.  It must be noted that the appearance of early X-ray rock art during the early to mid-Holocene  corresponds with major environmental and climatic changes that occur in the East Alligator  River region after sea-level stabilisation c. 8000 to 6000 BP (for further discussion, see Chapter 2,  this volume). Significant changes occur in archaeological assemblages during this period, such  as the appearance of shell middens at Ngarradj Warde Djobkeng (Allen and Barton 1989;  Kamminga and Allen 1973), major changes in stone artefact technologies (Hiscock 1999, 2011)  and the occupation of Birriwilk to the south of Red Lily Lagoon Site 3 (Shine et al. 2013). Taçon  and Brockwell (1995) and Taçon et al. (1996) suggest that these archaeological changes in the  early to mid-Holocene parallel the development of new rock art traditions. The radiocarbon age  determinations produced in this study support that proposition.  Conclusion This study has undertaken radiocarbon dating on different types of materials in order to  complement and test relative methods of assessing motif antiquity. First, the relative methods of  motif superimposition, stylistic analysis of motifs and motif preservation were employed. Then  radiocarbon dating was utilised on mineral accretions containing calcium oxalate and carbon- bearing material contained within ancient mud wasp nests. This is the first attempt in rock art  research to apply radiocarbon dating utilising these two different types of datable materials,  calcium oxalate and mud wasp nests, directly associated with a single item of rock art. Novel  developments in sampling pre-treatment for calcium oxalate mineral crusts have resolved some  of the previous criticisms of this method of radiocarbon dating, increasing the confidence of  age determinations. Combined with supplementary radiocarbon ages produced from mud wasp  nests, the results of this study have demonstrated that the adoption of multiple radiocarbon  age determinations generated from different substances can greatly assist rock art researchers to  generate robust radiometric data regarding the antiquity of rock art. Coupled with an ‘indirect’  dating analysis, evaluating the painting sequence, stylistic and preservation attributes of the rock  art, this study reliably proposes a minimum age of 5068–6636 cal BP for the introduction of early  X-ray art in western Arnhem Land rock art. This mid-Holocene age determination is supported  by previous chronological schemas, and parallels the changes evident in other archaeological  assemblages occurring during this period in the region.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="13"> 7.
