<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bertrand Russell as Scogan in Aldous Huxley's Crome Yellow MARGARET MORAN "Already it is a great deal less interesting than it was to people in the Twenties to know that Mr. Scogan resembles Bertrand Russell as Huxley had encountered him at Garsington." This statement by George Woodcock in Dawn and the Darkest Hour is part of an argument urging critics to devote their attention to the literary influences on Crome Yellow (1921) rather than being content merely to recognize the various targets of Huxley's satire within his own social set. Woodcock's words aptly remind us that a discussion of a roman à clef must not deteriorate into a parlor game concerned exclusively with matching acquaintances to characters. If Huxley's skill as a "supremely eclectic and assimilative" writer is to be fully appreciated, an effort must be made to trace the ideas he borrowed back to their origins.1 For Scogan, two related factors challenge this task. Both his creator and one of his models have made attempts, with differing degrees of resolution, to discourage an analysis of one important source for Scogan's thoughts. Perhaps fearing that his novels might be dismissed as simply derivative, Huxley made some necessarily half-hearted efforts to conceal his debts. One device he frequently employed was to draw composite portraits. Yet he had no wish entirely to forestall the detection of contributions from H. G. Wells and Norman Douglas intertwined with those from Russell2 in Scogan's cari cature. Huxley needed to take some preventive measures lest his comment on Boldero in Antic Hay be applied too readily to his own creative methods: Mosaic XVII/3 0027-1276-84/010117-18S01.50 ©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">118 Margaret Moran "All that belonged to other people he annexed without a scruple or a second thought, quite naturally, as though it were already his own."3 His dilemma was that although he did not want his originality impugned, he had to provide enough clues to Scogan's various identities so that the clever joke could be completely enjoyed. Satire, as Huxley knew, has always derived its power from the exaggeration or the falsification of the actual, rather than from invention ex nihilo. Its enjoyment and its moral results are in large measure dependent on the shock of recognizing the familiar through an unusual or fantastic presentation. To suffer as a satirist's victim is an unenvied state, but that discourtesy is seldom extended to the obscure. Ironically, Russell, who had been frustrated in his efforts to make his thought available to a non-professional audience through fiction, had succeeded so well in a different medium as a popularizer that he had the public attention necessary to justify his caricatured appearance in Huxley's novel. Russell's popular works written in the first two decades of this century have already receded into history to the extent that their unintentional effects on Crome Yellow are no longer immediately evident. However universally applicable its criticisms may be, satire relies on topical details more than do the lighter forms of comedy. Some satirical jokes there fore tend to require explaining to posterity. Satirists can certainly be excused if they do not wish themselves to provide this gloss. Huxley was prepared to offer a public acknowledgement of Norman Douglas' contribution to Scogan.4 But his non-fictional statement about Russell was a brief but forceful tribute to the clarity and felicity of his expression. In "The Relevance of Style" Huxley noted that whereas so many learned men had succumbed to the temptation to engage in stylistic self censorship by employing jargon and neologism, Russell stands as a model of lucidity. "The philosopher is also a writer, the humanistic psychologist and social scientist knows English. How fortunate for us!"5 Huxley's essay serves as a signal that the attitudes of the two toward each other's works were multidimensional enough to make the portrait of Scogan only the most interesting result of their interaction. While Huxley felt able in his later years to extend this praise to the philosopher's style, Russell was driven finally to give vent to his annoyance at his portrayal as Scogan. After nearly fifty years of silence, he complained to Ronald W. Clark that the ideas attributed to him in Huxley's first novel were those he had advanced in jest at a private party in Garsington Manor.6 Russell's version of the provenance for Scogan's ideas may provide only part of the explanation. Undoubtedly, he had been able, in the relaxed atmosphere of Lady Ottoline Morrell's country estate, temporarily to espouse certain views, no matter how outrageous, for the sheer joy of being argumentative. In so doing, he was unintentionally giving a self-parodic performance for the fledgling satirist in his company. Only a trusted guest at those social gatherings could have witnessed the uninhibited revelation of mannerisms and idiosyn cracies that lent many finely rendered details to the caricature.</page><page sequence="3">Russell and Huxley 119 The opportunity to watch Russell's participation in friendly banter, though of inestimable utility, was perhaps not the only stimulant to Huxley's imagina tion. Russell's frankness seems questionable because sufficient affinity can be found between Scogan's speeches and the thoughts expressed in some of Russell's popular books to arouse the suspicion that his written works could well have served as accessible sources. If it were not so, then Russell must be supposed, while Huxley was in his company at Garsington, to have rehearsed and recapitulated various aspects of his books at much greater length than he acknowledges. Although some of Scogan's notions are so general that their direct antecedents need not be sought, others align them selves closely enough with passages in Russell's popular writings to argue for indebtedness of a different order. Even if Huxley took his inspiration entirely from conversations with Russell, it was greatly to his advantage as a satirist that the concepts articulated in those exchanges were also readily available to the public. Since the brilliant repartee of Garsington can never be recreated, the philosopher's impact on Scogan's portrait can be assessed now only by comparing extracts from Russell's books to their rendering in Huxley's novel. The coincidence appears most notably with the theories Russell advanced in Principles of Social Reconstruction (1916). But other resemblances may also be discerned in Philosophical Essays (1910) and to a lesser degree in Roads to Freedom (1918). Russell's explanation of Scogan's genesis casts aspersions on Huxley's comic creativity by suggesting that the humor in the presentation was available ready-made in his own witty performance. The insinuation that Huxley had abused his friendship seems also to have been intended. This allegation might have been expected to have gained credibility from the fact that others of Huxley's victims had, with more legitimacy, felt mistreated in this way. Lady Ottoline Morrell, the hostess of Garsington, believed that the portrayal of her circle as the inhabitants of Crome was an outrageous offence against the hospitality and friendship she had graciously extended to Huxley.7 But although her dealings with her protégé may have been entirely open-hearted, there is no cause to think that Russell had been comparably generous and unguarded. He had been so neutral about Huxley as to make only the most perfunctory acknowledgements of his existence in his correspondence. (A casual reference to Lady Constance Malleson on 21 December 1916 that Huxley had come to visit is exceptional.) Huxley was probably an acquaintance close enough only for the sharing of teas, picnics and the occasional minor complaint about health.8 They had each been drawn to Garsington for "fantastic surroundings, art, classy chats about the cosmos, the intelligentsia, love."9 The remoteness of their association is evident in the fact that Russell felt obliged to ask Lady Ottoline to arrange a meeting with Huxley in 1932 when he wanted to give Aldous some "rather nice letters"10 that T.H. Huxley had sent to Russell's mother. "I don't feel I know Aldous well enough to ask him myself without preliminary," he continued. (#1712,3 May 1932).</page><page sequence="4">120 Margaret Moran Although Huxley's familiarity with Russell's private life was quite limited, no similar constraints impeded the knowledge of his books. Writing to his brother on 30 April 1918, Huxley mentioned that Russell had read aloud chapters from Roads to Freedom in his presence." Subsequent letters testify to an ongoing interest, especially in the development of Russell's thought on popular issues. For Huxley's satiric purposes, it was enough that he had sufficient personal experience with Russell to notice occasions when theory seemed at odds with practice. Of course, Huxley was not loath to derive some of his popularity from the fact that he had enjoyed at Garsington the oppor tunity for an insider's glance at the affairs of the famous and the notorious. He was ready to take full advantage of readers' tendency to imagine "that celebrated people must be more interesting than other people."12 And there will always remain an aspect of Crome Yellow that is penetrable only by the cognoscenti. Yet, Huxley could hardly rely exclusively on privileged informa tion without restricting his audience to a small coterie who might themselves be expected to take umbrage at the personal ridicule or the collective mockery. His "Peacockian novel"13 could make a wide appeal only with the public dimensions of at least some of his satiric targets clearly in view. Huxley made no attempt to do any justice to Russell's philosophy in its totality, but instead confined himself to the manipulation of statements he wrenched from their contexts. By this means, Russell stands accused of such flaws as arrogance, insensitivity, Utopianism and (most important) excessive rationalism. Even though Russell's assertions are the major weapons, the result is still an ad hominem attack. However human the weaknesses may be, it is nevertheless Russell's role qua philosopher that inspires the caricature. As Huxley makes Sebastian Barnack note in Time Must Have A Stop, "The fallacy of most philosophies is the philosopher."14 Since Huxley's satiric range is large enough to be called ubiquitous, there is no cause to entertain the notion that any special private malice was involved. Rather, Russell serves him as a symbol on the grand scale for a disturbing human quality : the failure to integrate mind, heart and flesh. Because Russell has the temerity to offer answers to the dilemmas of his contemporaries, he becomes vulnerable to comic mockery whenever the insinuation can be made that his own thoughts and passions are all confused. In order to undermine Russell's authority as a guide to modern man, Huxley resorts to tactics that are, as would be expected in a satire, not completely fair. His great advantage was that he knew Russell's habits of mind well enough that he could turn the philosopher's utterances against him. No evidence has so far come to light to indicate Russell's initial response to the appearance of Crome Yellow. The temptation is strong to imagine that Russell might have been thinking about Crome Yellow when he said during an interview for Everyman in 1930: "I think all writers of first novels should be given six months in jail....only the good ones would think it worth their while to do it." Yet, he proceeded to say : "I like Aldous Huxley. It's the fashion to decry Huxley just now, but I think he's very good."15 Only a mind</page><page sequence="5">Russell and Huxley 121 reader could declare with certainty whether this tribute was inspired by magnanimity or cunning. The publication of Brave New World in 1932 gave Russell immediate consternation, though for entirely new reasons. Whereas he had good cause to gloss over the inducement he provided to Huxley's creativity in Crome Yellow, he felt deprived of his rightful recognition for the effect he exerted over Brave New World. Russell's dark warning of the possibility of scientific tyranny, presented only a year earlier in the last section of The Scientific Outlook, seemed to him directly influential. Writing to his publisher, Sir Stanley Unwin, on 22 February 1932, Russell called the fantasy "merely an expansion of the two penultimate chapters" of his own work. "The only thing he has added is the Bokanovsky twins; otherwise the parallelism applied in great detail, e.g. the prohibition of Shakespeare and the intoxicant producing no headache."16 Paradoxically, Russell was both minimizing and exaggerating the degree of indebtedness. If the two penulti mate chapters had been so useful, then the other four chapters of Part Three, "The Scientific Society," also warrant consideration. In fact, one of his own examples, the denial of the right to read Shakespeare in the restrictive, if comfortable, world he had postulated, had been expressed in the first chapter of Part Three in this way: "serious students of history will be able to obtain a permit from the Government to study such works as Hamlet and Othello, but the general public will be forbidden access to them on the ground that they glorify private murder."17 However stimulating his words had undeniably been, Russell had no serious wish to usurp credit for the way this (or any other) germinal statement had been extended imaginatively in Huxley's novel. His understandable irritation at the assimilation of his ideas was tempered by respect for a talent he missed in himself: the ability to shape thought into a fictional form. Russell's public review of Brave New World therefore provided no more than the faintest hint that he felt any cause for grievance. By choosing as his original title for the review "A Manipulator's Paradise" (Russell Archives)—thereby repeating the word "manipulator" which had reverberated through the final chapter of The Scientific Outlook—he was prepared to offer a clue that he was inviting renewed scrutiny of his own book. Published in The New Leader,18 the review took as its title "We Don't Want To Be Happy," but a reference within the text to "scientific manipulators" was retained. Russell's restrained annoyance in 1932 over Huxley's appropriation of his ominous predictions lends some retrospective irony to the fact that his major public function as a character in Crome Yellow is that of fortune-teller. Disguised as Sesostris, the Sorceress of Ecbetana, Scogan happily plays the part of soothsayer at the fair. Huxley, of course, required no prescience of his own to cast Russell in the role of seer. In Principles of Social Recon struction, Russell had proclaimed himself a harbinger of hope to war-torn Britain through his advocacy of a total reorganization of society. For Huxley's satire, Scogan's masquerade in vatic robes was exploited merely as an opportunity for making asignations with attractive young women. By thus</page><page sequence="6">122 Margaret Moran emphasizing Scogan's venery, Huxley found a humorous way to question whether Russell's forecasts about the relaxation of the sexual code advocated in his "Marriage and the Population Question" (Chapter 6 of Principles) had been prompted in part by self-interest. The comedy of the fortune-telling episode depends a good deal on the variability of Russell's own romantic history. (By the time of the publication of the novel, Russell had been married twice and during the interim had experienced two momentous affairs and several other involvements of less importance.) But more complex ironical effects are derived from the fact that Scogan is much too cerebral to do other than arrange rendezvous or discuss changing sexual customs in a dry, theoretical way. For all his talk about his insatiable lust, he poses no greater threat for the women of Crome than the occasional victimization for a dance and the frequent captivation for a lecture. Although he encourages Ivor's tireless pursuit of new conquests, his own favorite quarry is thought. The discrepancy between his own self-image as one addicted to indulgence in the flesh and his actual preference for the joys of conceptualization is betrayed by the cool moderation of his encomium for sexual delight : "Amour is the one human activity of any importance in which laughter and pleasure pre dominate, if ever so slightly, over misery and pain."19 Through Scogan, Russell stands accused in Chapter 6 of Principles (and proleptically in Marriage and Morals, 1929) of imposing an overly common sensical system upon our human sexuality. The topic was one for which he, as a too reasonable Olympian, could best feign understanding as if in costume. Since Russell was unable to respond to Huxley by drawing a satiric portrait of his own, he had to be content with occasional jibes. In Marriage and Morals he noted, "When people no longer feel any moral barrier against sexual inter course on every occasion when even a trivial impulse inclines to it, they get into the habit of dissociating sex from serious emotion and from feelings of affection; they may even come to associate it with feelings of hatred. Of this sort of thing Aldous Huxley's novels afford the best illustration."20 After Brave New World, Russell showed more animosity: "Modern young intellectuals are apt to model themselves upon Mr. Aldous Huxley or one of his characters, with the result that their behaviour becomes unnatural, stilted and priggish."21 Because Scogan is tainted more by priggishness than lechery, his intellectual ism forces him to subject, not only sexual desire, but all other emotions and impulses to rational scrutiny. His most extended discourse argues that men of reason must find the means to appeal to the instincts of the multitude if civilization is to be preserved: "Everything that ever gets done in this world is done by madmen....For the madman appeals to what is fundamental, to passion and the instincts, the philosophers to what is superficial and superogatory—reason.... If you want to get men to act reasonably, you must set about persuading them in a maniacal manner....The fact remains that sanity unassisted is useless. What we want, then, is a sane and reasonable exploitation of the forces of insanity" (pp. 237, 239). In so saying, Scogan would appear to be offering his own exaggerated version of Russell's central</page><page sequence="7">Russell and Huxley 123 thesis in Principles : "the belief that impulse has more effect than conscious purpose in moulding men's lives."22 In Scogan's discourse, satire is directed at an intellectual aristocrat who cautions against the overestimation of reason in a manner that is so clever as to work against his own argument. Russell might have found Huxley's charge of excessive confidence in the powers of the mind to be rather puzzling, because the notion that any topic should be written about in other than a rational way had seldom seriously tempted him. In June 1915, he told Lady Ottoline Morrell, "I like the idea of analysing political institutions and beliefs—letting in the light of reason and liberty on cobwebbed caverns of superstition" (#1291). While the exposure of the absurdities inherent in the then current political and social system did not demand the full force of his intellect, the compulsion that would have come instinctively to an imaginative author to make the content shape the form was foreign to his sensibilities. At an early stage, Russell's plans for Principles suffered the severe strictures of D.H. Lawrence who had originally agreed to collaborate with him on the project. Because they had found the war to be equally appalling, they had assumed initially that their views were far more compatible than they ever actually were. According to an arrangement worked out in mid-June of 1915, Russell intended to give a series of lectures in conjunction with Lawrence. But the scheme for co-operation was shortlived. When in early July, Lawrence received a lecture syllabus from Russell, he responded with disgust. In Russell's words to Lady Ottoline, Lawrence objected to his synopsis because it was "not mystical and Blake-ish enough for him." For his part, Russell found offensive Lawrence's inability to rely upon "impartial observation." "When he talks politics he seems so wild that I could not formally work with him" (#1302). All hopes for compromise were completely shattered by September. In January through March of 1916, Russell gave in splendid isolation the lectures that were published in November as his Principles. Having already weathered Lawrence's accusations of extreme intellectualism, Russell's theories awaited Huxley's onslaught in five years' time. For scholars looking backward,23 the high drama of the part played by D.H. Lawrence in the inception of Principles has diverted attention away from the possibility that Huxley perceived his role as the commentator on their dispute. Their attempted collaboration had proved conclusively that "madmen" or men of faith could not be forced into the service of directing intelligences nearly so easily as Scogan was pleased to believe. According to Russell's Autobiography, the First World War led him to revise his "conception of human nature."24 To understand why men fight so that he could suggest ways of preventing future conflicts, he was driven with considerable repugnance to face man's irrationality. Russell's reluctant obliga tion to evolve a new definition of man's essence is hinted at in the novel's barnyard scene. When the laborer, Rowley, looks at the wallowing swine and says, "Rightly is they called pigs," Scogan declares: "Yes. And I wish I could, with as much justice, say, 'Rightly are we called men'" (p. 43).</page><page sequence="8">124 Margaret Moran As a philosopher, Russell always stood implacably opposed to the anti intellectualism that had gained dangerous legitimacy in the modern world through the popularity of such writers an Nietzsche, Bergson and James. While he was compelled by the war to modify his view of man's nature, he would not capitulate to the trends of his time by surrendering his rational methodology even for the analysis of irrationality. To do so would have led to the same "errors and confusions of the intellect" he had found so offensive in a writer like Bergson, whom he reviewed in 1912. Firmly insisting that "though the desire for knowledge is rare, it has been the source of most of what is best in philosophy," he classifies philosophies into three groups: "Thus we shall have philosophies of feeling, inspired by the love of happiness ; theoretical philosophies, inspired by the love of knowledge; and practical philosophies, inspired by the love of action."25 The superiority of the systems of thought represented by the second category is unequivocally declared. Russell's tripartite division parallels Scogan's stratification of society into "the Directing Intelligences, the Men of Faith, and the Herd" (p. 243). Here too, the preeminence of men of intellect is axiomatic. By allowing Scogan to apply a rigorously categorical approach to social arrangement, Huxley questions whether the philosopher's systematic methods have any direct utility for political theory. In Crome Yellow, Huxley gives only passing acknowledgement to Russell's anti-militarism—the raison d'être for Principles. The plea for pacifism finds its way into only two of Scogan's speeches because Huxley's risibility was not aroused by this aspect of Russell's life. Since Russell believed that national aggression had gained widespread support from the failure of the current social structure to satisfy natural human impulses, his book is obliged to suggest sweeping reforms to many institutions. Russell felt the need to devote chapters to such diverse topics as education, marriage and religion, as well as to more predictable concerns like the organization of the state. Not every issue considered in Principles has analogous importance for Scogan. Instead, some general features of the book were highly suggestive : the nearly encyclopedic range of interests and the orientation toward the future. Probably the greatest advantage to the fiercest aspect of his satiric deline ation came from a recognition of a conflict in the tone of the book. Although Russell adopted the voice of the common man, he assumed such authorita tiveness in venturing answers for all social ills so as to exhibit the audacity and omniscience suitable only in a philosopher-king. This tension between Russell's egalitarianism and his elitism is captured with extraordinary shrewd ness in Scogan. Russell's self-imposed need to free himself from his class in order to serve as the liberal defender of individualism explains Scogan's modesty about his humble origins and the brevity of his family history: "After the second generation we Scogans are lost in the mists of antiquity" (p. 121). To Lady Ottoline Morrell he wrote in December 1914 that the book was designed to be "an attack on governing classes everywhere and an appeal to the humanity of ordinary men and women" (#1175). From the first, he told</page><page sequence="9">Russell and Huxley 125 her, in January 1915, he had recognized the need to be frankly "propagandists," to permit the wide appeal that would allow his book to become "a kind of Bible of democracy" (#1187). Yet Huxley's suspicions that Russell may have been attracted to political theory because of his claim (whether by heredity or merit) to the right to govern are transmuted into Scogan's straightforward admission of his thirst for power. '"We sane men will have the power yet'. Mr. Scogan's eyes shone with a more than ordinary brightness, and, taking his pipe out of his mouth, he gave vent to his loud, dry, and somehow rather fiendish laugh" (p. 240). In reaction to Russell's judgment (expressed in Philosophical Essays) that pragmatism had erred in allowing itself to be so influenced by democracy as to have a "tendency to decide philosophical questions by putting them to the vote," Huxley took care to supply Scogan "with the usual dictatorial tone"26 of philosophers. If Huxley had cause for believing that Russell had an overweening urge to attain power, he must have discerned that urge operating in a rather covert way. Had he wished, Russell might have attained political leadership virtually for the asking. Grandson of the British prime minister who had presided over the passage of the First Reform Bill, Russell had been encouraged from child hood to aspire to the highest level of government service. When he instead chose for himself a scholar's life, he thwarted family tradition and cast aside ready opportunity. By 1921, he had turned from the academic world long enough to engage in two parliamentary contests, but neither of these forays into politics was anything like what might have seemed appropriate for one who enjoyed a legacy from Lord John Russell. In the first instance, he had run in 1907 as a women's suffrage candidate for Wimbledon, knowing before hand that he would be defeated, but still believing that the cause deserved his support. Three years thereafter, he had offered himself as a candidate in Bedford, but his refusal to compromise about religion destroyed his chances. This comic opera form of direct political involvement clearly gave no warrant to Huxley's innuendoes. To the extent that Russell coveted control over his fellow man, ambition was centered on the wish to mold public opinion and to shape serious thought. This desire was based on the assumptions that he had something sensible to say and that his readership would find his carefully reasoned arguments persuasive. Although there may have been arrogance involved in the certainty that he deserved a wide hearing, any such vanity was intermixed with a righteous determination to ameliorate the human condition. His passionate conviction that people could not be unaffected by the force of painstaking argument allowed him to cherish his belief in democracy. On several occasions in Principles, Russell asserts his democratic views by emphasizing his concern that the power of the state must be restrained (by the state itself) to prevent interference with the full and free development of the potential in each citizen at every social level. However, his stress on the importance of the realization of individual impulses was balanced by a recognition that certain prohibitions would always be essential for general welfare of the group. "Some thwarting of special desires is unavoidable even</page><page sequence="10">126 Margaret Moran in the best imaginable community, since some men's desires, unchecked, lead to the oppression or destruction of others. In a good community Napoleon could not have been allowed the profession of his choice, but he might have found happiness as a pioneer in Western America. He could not have found happiness as a City clerk, and no tolerable organization of society would compel him to become a City clerk."27 Scogan's discussion of the Caesars as the logical development of human beings must surely be an ironical inversion of Russell's insistence that men must be granted the opportunity to attain their full stature : "It's as well that Denis hasn't been permitted to flower into a little Nero, and that Ivor remains only potentially a Caligula. Yes, it's better so, no doubt. But it would have been more amusing as a spectacle, if they had had the chance to develop, untrammelled, the full horror of their potentialities" (p. 162). Through Scogan's cynicism and his frankness about his own will to power, Huxley implies that Russell's comprehension of aggression in others and in himself, notwithstanding the terrible lesson of the Great War, had remained at a rather naive stage. At the time of the composition of Principles, Russell's moods had fluctuated much more than Huxley's criticism of his unwarranted ebulliency could be expected to notice. Nevertheless, Russell's correspondence of the day does show that he habitually found comfort from the deep despair that the war engendered by evolving plans for the rehabilitation, and indeed the betterment, of civilized life. This passage from a letter of 31 May 1915 to Lady Ottoline Morrell may be taken as representative of the manner in which Russell encouraged himself and subsequently his readership : "The world grows more and more black and furious. We are nowhere near the worst yet. But a new order must emerge from all this" (#1281). Presumably, Huxley found further illustration of an irrepressible optimism in Russell's conviction that man's capacity for compassion can and must be deepened to make us fully human. In Principles Russell's trust in our ability to attain self-transcendence was expressed in this way: "It is possible to feel the same interests in the joys and sorrows of others as in our own, to love and hate independently of all relation to ourselves, to care about the destiny of man and the development of the universe without a thought that we are personally involved" (p. 207). The argument is advanced that people become mean and egotistical when social institutions frustrate their laudable urge for self-realization: "Our institutions rest upon injustice and authority: it is only by closing our hearts against sympathy and our minds against truth that we can endure the oppressions and unfairnesses by which we profit" (p. 23). To Russell's confident assertion that magnanimity would flourish in a better social structure, Scogan retorts with the argument that natural limitations of sympathy serve as an indispensable asset to the human race. "If one had an imagination vivid enough and a sympathy sufficiently sensitive really to comprehend and to feel the sufferings of other people, one would never have a moment's peace of mind" (p. 164).</page><page sequence="11">Russell and Huxley 127 From the perspective of 1921, Russell's optimism about the possibility for social improvement seemed to offer a vulnerable satiric target. By then, the reform movement with which the word "Reconstruction" in his title had allied itself had proved in the public mind to be a disastrous failure. Yet, the sales of Russell's book continued high enough to suggest that his thesis had some immunity to the widespread disappointment resulting from the inability of the coalition government under Lloyd George to enact their schemes for reconstruction.28 Since Russell's book accused organizations of corruption, while vindicating the benignity of man's essential nature, his argument retained some considerable persuasiveness. Russell's discussion could still flatter his readers through its romantic assumption about the innocence of the individual in a way that Scogan's scathing indictments never deigned to attempt. Thus, Russell's ironic prediction to Unwin in a letter of 29 October 1918 had not come true : "I have been a war profiteer, as the approach of peace is bound to diminish the interest in my writings" (Russell Archives). Taken together, the extracts from Principles and Crome Yellow demonstrate that Scogan's relationship to his real-life prototype has considerable complexity and variability. At times, he is made to create a travesty of Russell's argument by employing such devices as inversion, understatement and exaggeration, and by wrenching ideas from their proper contexts. Yet Scogan's speeches are not always complete misrepresentations. Occasionally, he actually reports an observation without twisting it at all. More often, he has the temerity to answer Russell by, as it were, "correcting" his pronouncements when they seem too sanguine. This final situation may be thought about as the opposite of the reductio ad absurdum. Here, the satiric target is criticized in a positive manner by allowing his persona to engage in the thankless task of "improving" upon his theories. In his interactions with the other characters in Crome Yellow, Scogan fulfills similar negative and positive functions. Although he suffers no less than the rest as comic butt, he is also unique in acting often as touchstone. Perhaps because satire itself appeals to the mind, the form has a predisposition to be more patient with men of intellect—until their excesses become grossly exorbitant—than with people afflicted by other kinds of absurdity. Scogan's effect on readers is similarly mixed. He may pander to our mediocrity by encouraging a smugness about having avoided intemperances possible only for a genius. But to the extent that we find ourselves interested in the mental pyrotechnics of Crome Yellow, we are obliged to confess a predisposition for some of Scogan's excesses. Huxley saw himself exaggerated in Scogan, and so in our turn must we. Scogan's double role as the source and subject of mockery is apparent in his reaction to literature. In his recognition of the maudlin as a special danger for writers of the Künstlerroman, he gives voice to Huxley's own self-congratulation at having had the wit to avoid any such temptation in his own first novel. Thus, Scogan's speech (p. 26) summarizing the book Denis Stone is currently composing reflects the author's own deliberate rejection</page><page sequence="12">128 Margaret Moran of the extremes of sensibility. But although literature can admittedly indulge too much in fine feeling, Scogan's recommendation that it become entirely logical errs to an even more ludicrous degree in the opposite direction. Since Russell never elaborated a systematic literary or esthetic theory, Scogan's assessment of his own talents includes this remark: "Thus, while I may have a certain amount of intelligence, I have no aesthetic sense" (p. 273). At most, Russell had offered occasional asides about art while his attention was directed elsewhere. In "Science and Art under Socialism" (Chapter 7 in Roads to Freedom) Russell made, for example, a brief comment about the social and economic conditions that have fostered genius. "The men who have used private means as an opportunity for creative work have been few but important: one might mention Milton, Shelley, Keats, and Darwin as examples. Probably none of these would have produced as good work if they had been forced to earn their livelihood."29 This passage is modified quite drastically for Scogan's defense of aristocracies. While Scogan's speech remains faithful to Russell's stress upon the nonconformity of men of genius, he garbles the most essential point by applying a segment from a discussion about the means of encouraging creativity within a classless society to an argument favoring the preservation of hierarchical distinctions. Scogan himself need not address Russell's belief that eccentricity and great inventiveness are related because the absence of this form of creativity at Crome speaks for itself. Instead the main satiric thrust of Scogan's misrepresentation is the reinforcement of the doubt that Russell had ever abandoned the privileged perspective to which his birth gave title. Eccentricity....It's the justification of all aristocracies....If you're to do anything reasonable in this world, you must have a class of people who are secure, safe from public opinion, safe from poverty, leisured, not compelled to waste their time in the imbecile routines that go by the name of Honest Work....That's the important thing about an aristocracy. Not only is it eccentric itself—often grandiosely so; it also tolerates and even encourages eccentricities in others. The eccentricities of the artist and the new-fangled thinker don't inspire it with that fear, loathing, and disgust which the burgesses instinctively feel towards them. (p. 106) If there is some wicked injustice in this scrambling of Russell's political position, the unfairness becomes perhaps more pronounced whenever Huxley projects an opinion from one set of circumstances into an inapprop riate sphere. Scogan's demand that all forms of art, and indeed (insofar as possible) life itself, must be divorced from nature quite probably depends upon a passage in "The Study of Mathematics" in which that discipline is said to be a high art form. Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and</page><page sequence="13">Russell and Huxley 129 capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show....Remote from passions, remote even from the pitiful facts of nature, the generations have gradually created an ordered cosmos, where pure thought can dwell in its natural home, and where one, at least, of our nobler impulses can escape from the dreary exile of the actual world.30 Scogan concludes that the goal of all art is to reach the severe degree of disengagement possible only in pure mathematics or Cubism. In thereby foisting upon Russell's surrogate the preposterous advocacy of absolute detachment for all art, Huxley allows one esthetic form, the novel, to take its vengeance upon a philosophy too crabbed to admit art as an area worthy of its thorough investigation. Scogan's own favorite novels are the Tales of Knockespotch because they have attained a degree of abstraction so extreme that the books have ceased to exist. So far has Knockespotch spurned the "dreary tyranny" of realism that the human mind presents itself to him "in a vacuum" (p. 151). In a similar vein, Scogan praises the architecture of Crome because "it's so unmistakably and aggressively a work of art. It makes no compromise with nature, but affronts it and rebels against it" (p. 100). The imputation of this attitude to Russell's representative in the novel gains added irony from the contrast drawn between Crome and the tower Shelley described in "Epipsychidion." Whereas Shelley's tower seemed to have "assumed its form and grown/ Out of mountain, from the living stone," Crome supposedly derives its grandeur by avoiding any suggestion of having "sprouted from the clods" (p. 101). Since Russell considered Shelley to be the best poet and "Epipsychidion" among his greatest masterpieces, he might have felt partic ularly ill-used by the way Huxley turns the poet's words against his alleged esthetic position. With the slightest documentary evidence to indicate that Huxley knew of the work, the conclusion would be irresistible that the Tales of Knockespotch owed something to the novella Russell wrote during 1912-13, "The Perplexities of John Forstice." (Since his fiction was not published until 1972,31 it was in Huxley's day as inaccessible as the Tales of Knockespotch.) Whereas Russell could write expository prose on almost any subject with the highest wit, vitality and grace, his style suddenly became wooden when he directed his efforts to fiction. Since his novella was concerned primarily with ideas, he subordinated, almost out of existence, the usual interests of the story-teller in fully rounded characters, compelling plot lines and appropriate scenic backgrounds. Like Knockespotch, he presented the human mind disporting itself in a vacuum. To Russell's fictional attempt, Lady Ottoline Morrell had actually con tributed one short section. Her uncharacteristically energetic involvement with "Forstice" lends credibility to the hypothesis that she might have felt free shortly thereafter to tell Huxley about their shared enterprise. Indeed, she might have gone so far as to have let him read the manuscript. With even</page><page sequence="14">130 Margaret Moran the faintest hint from either her or Russell himself, Huxley's always sug gestible imagination might have been set to work. One wants to say that more might have resulted from even a casual mention of Russell's venture into fiction than analogues with the imaginary Knockespotch. From the smallest clue that Russell had a few years ago endeavored to write a Peacockian novel, Huxley might have found the incentive to try one of his own. Lady Ottoline's well known desire to encourage the arts could easily have led her to act as catalyst in this way. Comparison of "The Perplexities of John Forstice" with Crome Yellow dispels the notion that Huxley found Russell as a novelist to be a model worth imitating in anything but the primacy accorded to intellectual content. Yet, even if this were Russell's only service to the satirist, then his impact on modern letters might have been of a dif ferent order than has been hitherto supposed. Unfortunately, the connection between Russell's unsatisfactory efforts in literature and Crome Yellow must remain purely speculative. While this association can be made only tentatively, there is no strain in believing that Russell was directly, if ironically, behind Scogan's nonsensical antipathy not only to natural elements in art, but also to natural content in life itself. The repugnance felt for "Nature's hideous system" (p. 47) of propagating the species causes Scogan to anticipate optimistically the devel opment of artificial methods of generation. Russell recommended in Chapter 6 of Principles that "a scientific treatment of the birth-rate" (p. 183) was advisable to halt the deterioration of the species. By offering incentives to the "best" people to reproduce themselves, the state might act in a benign manner to practice eugenics. But such intervention by the state was envisaged as being confined to the provision of economic inducements for "worthy" people and their "desirable" offspring. Russell's daring, though limited, plan was designed as a corrective to the current social arrangement which tended to reward gifted people who concentrated their talents on goals other than those of careful parenting. Although Russell's proposal was not entirely modest, it did not by itself provide a basis for Huxley's severity. Huxley had to make an unnatural coupling—between Russell's audacious view about breeding in Principles and the desire he expressed in "The Study of Mathematics" for release from the "pitiful facts of nature"—in order to declare Russell responsible for the grotesque progeny Scogan adopts. Scogan's abhorrence for Nature's complexity and diversity, because such richness defies systematic organization, leads to the retreat into a man-made cosmos of pure thought. His vision of this place of exile from the actual world is a comfortable realm where "all is human and the product of friendly and comprehensible minds" (p. 252). Russell had protested often enough about anthropomorphism in rival philosophical systems that the accusuation of the same failing in his own outlook might have seemed to him a false charge. Scogan's preference for ideas, because they are "so snug and neat and simple and well made" (p. 252) in contrast to nature's obscurity, cannot protect him from the obligation to construct a pluralistic metaphysical system. Ironically,</page><page sequence="15">Russell and Huxley 131 his reluctance to deal directly with the complexity of nature by retreating into pure thought ends in the construction of a cosmology that itself insists upon multiplicity. Thus, Scogan like Russell before him,32 sees the various parts of the universe as "fundamentally discrete" (p. 322). Significantly, Scogan propounds this theory as he wedges himself between two other characters. In the world of Crome, where every individual lacks a sense of integrated self hood and private obsessions prevent true community, Scogan only encourages further imbalance and severance. Although he prizes his position as a leader, teacher and judge, he offers no answers to his companions, but instead exacerbates and epitomizes their predicaments. Aside from this unflattering reference to his pluralism, Russell's notable achievements in philosophy (and mathematics) were not subjected to any satiric treatment. Huxley's focus instead was on the ideas of a popular book where Russell offered ways to create harmony within the state by beginning with the analogy of the well-adjusted individual. To question Russell's right to diagnose the ailments of the macrocosm, Huxley attempted to cast doubt on the wholeness and health of his own personality as the overly refined intellectual. Insofar as Russell allowed such allegations to trouble him, he might have experienced perplexity about the choice of theories from Principles as the major source of Huxley's satire. There, Russell had more than usual cause for believing that he had given the forces of unreason their due. Organized by loose connections, influenced by D.H.Lawrence and addressed to the topic of impulse, that book must have impressed its author as his greatest compromise to date with claims of the irrational. Both Scogan at Crome and Russell in Principles are philosophers on holiday; yet, as Scogan laments, an escape from the self proves impossible.
