Submit five single-sided copies. Manu- scripts will not be returned. If you enclose a stamped, self-addressed postcard, we will ac- knowledge receipt of your manuscript. All copy must be typed doublespaced (including indented quotes, footnotes and references) on 8? by 11 inch white paper. Pages must be numbered con- secutively, including references. Leave wide mar- gins; typed lines should not exceed six inches. Avoid the generic use of male nouns or pronouns. For anonymity in the review process, authors' names should appear only on a separate cover page. Remove all other identifying material (e.g., citations and references to authors' work, identify- ing footnotes) from four of the five copies submit- ted. Papers that do not meet these requirements will be returned without review to the author. After acceptance, agreement must be reached be- tween author and editor on all matters concerning the ms. before it goes to the printer. Authors will receive page proofs, but only printer errors may be changed at that time. Cover Page. Attach a cover page showing au- thorship and institutional affiliation. Include any acknowledgments at the bottom of the page pre- ceded by an asterisk. Abstract. Include a short summary of the prob- lem, procedures, and results. Footnotes. Footnotes should be avoided if possi- ble by incorporating footnote information into the text. When absolutely necessary, they should be numbered consecutively and attached as an ap- pendix to the text. Tables. Type each table on a separate page and append at the end of the manuscript. Insert a lo- cation note at the appropriate place in the text (e.g., Table I about here). Figures. Figures should be drawn with India ink on drawing paper for clear photoreproducibility. Retain the originals (for transmission to editor upon acceptance) and append copies at the end of the manuscript. Symbols. Clarify symbols with notes in the mar- gin. Encircle the notes to show they are not in- tended for printing. Citations in Text. 1. Authors' names and publication dates used in the text should be enclosed in parentheses. Cite pages only in the case of a direct quote, as shown below. 2. Separate multiple references by a semicolon. 3. For dual or triple authorship, give all last names; for more than three authors, use "et al." (but include all names in the references follow- ing the text). 4. For authors with more than one citation in the same year, designate by "a," "b," etc. EXAMPLES 1. Becker (1976:114) claims that "the problem stems. ." 2. . . . influence by a jurisprudential orientation (Andenaes 1974; Hawkins 1973; Zimring 1971). 3. (Erickson and Gibbs 1973; Taylor et al. 1973). 4. (Rose 1954a, b). References Following Text List all sources alphabetically by author, and within author by year of publication, in an appen- dix entitled "References." Use no italics, under- lining or abbreviations. Give page numbers for the convenience of the readers, as appropriate. Use first names, not initials, for each author and editor listed in the references. EXAMPLES Durkheim, Emile [1897] Suicide.
