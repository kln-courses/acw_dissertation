<plain_text><page sequence="1">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON-JI. THE SUPREME POWER. ITS ORIGINS, TITLES, ATTAINMENT AND FORFEITURE. LIKE the power of the first Khans, that of the later Emperors was not absolute but more or less limited. It is true that the Prince (or Khan) and the Emperor were the representatives of supreme government wholly and solely; but neither the military character of the Khan government nor, after the con- version of the Court of Pr6slav, the Byzantine doctrines concerning the divine origin of authority made any radical change in the system of Bulgarian rule, which derived from the Bulgarian Slav's interpretation of customary law. The factors which limited the power of the monarch were the democratic and military councils and later those of the nobles and the popular assemblies. These councils, which were national and ecclesiastical, played, like the lesser assemblies of the village and the clan, an important part in local self-govern- ment. Some historians wrongly affirm that the Bulgarian councils. and assemblies had not a decisive, but only an advisory vote. In England too the resolutions of Parliament had an advisory character. There could have been no public opinion in those times. Nevertheless, the more advanced part of the Bulgarian community, which carried on the traditions of the Slav communal outlook on life, did to some extent check the ruler of the state from aiming at absolute power. Actual instances of absolute power occurred but were always exceptional. The titles of the ruler were as follows: Prince (Knjaz), Khan or Khakan and Emperor (tsar). Asparuch and his successors called themselves Khan and Khakan, as may be seen from the inscrip- tions on the stone columns of Aboba-Pliska and elsewhere. On the other hand, the Slavonic terminology retained its traces in the name of prince (Knjaz), which appears in written monuments. Khan or Khakan is a title which is widely employed by all Asiatic peoples, Turks, Manchus and Chinese. Indian rulers 99</page><page sequence="2">ioo THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. also have called themselves illustrious and supreme Khans. The Turkish rulers of Stambul bore both titles at one time; the ancient rulers of the Crimea also used the same name. Literally, Khan or Khakan means commander, ruler, or as Turkish diction- aries translate it, padishah (sultan). Some historians claim that the term knjaz (prince) comes from the old German kunig, mod. German konig. However, the most probable explanation is that the term knjaz was common to certain Asiatic peoples at a time when they inhabited a common fatherland, and in their languages words from this root have been preserved: ku2n, Sanscrit: kan (rajah), kuni (generation). Knjaz means the head of a family. The same name was given originally to the head of the joint family, later to the elder of the village. The word is to be found in all Slav peoples, though with some it denotes the head of the spiritual flock (priest; e.g., Czechs, Poles and Dalmatians.) In Serbo-Croat and in our western provinces knez denotes mayor. Later both in Russia and Serbia, as well as in Bulgaria, knjaz became a title given to the sovereign. The title of Emperor (tsar) appears first in the time of Simeon. It comes from Cesar, cisar, Caesar. True Caesar, i.e., tsar, does not correspond entirely to Basileus or Imperator, but Simeon added to this title that of " despot," i.e., autocrat, and in this manner he prevented the title of tsar being equated with Basileus or Imperator. At first Simeon styled himself " Emperor of all Bulgarians," but later " Emperor of all Bulgarians and Greeks." Letters exchanged between the Byzantine Emperor Romanus Lecapenus and the Patriarch Nicholas Mysticus with Simeon are exceedingly interesting in this connection. The correspondence lasted some time, and.in it both the Emperor and the Patriarch endeavoured by every means to dissuade Simeon from going to war for the capture of Constantinople, but sought rather to con- vince him that he had no right to the title of " Emperor of all Bulgarians and Greeks " (Baat2ev rciov Bovlyaecov xaS 'Pcy,Iaiov). At last they accepted the title of " Emperor of all Bulgarians," but from time to time Simeon styled himself " Emperor of all Bulgarians and Greeks." Romanus asked Simeon: " How is it that your most lofty and penetrating mind has not understood that we have not written in regard to the harmless title of Emperor, but because you style yourself Emperor of the Greeks also; for in your own land you may do whatever you please, though to speak truth you should not even do that, since whence can it be that this name was given to you ? From your forefathers ? It may be, but at all events you know. . . . And how can there</page><page sequence="3">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON ioi be two Emperors, as you so vainly contend, who differ in their lineage, and in their manner of thought, and vie with one another for imperial dignity ? And with what Greeks are you in accord when you call yourself Emperor of the Greeks also, since these do not allow you this name? " Simeon, however, seriously regarded the title Emperor as equivalent to Basileus. In it he saw, and by it he wished to emphasise, the full independence of the State of Bulgaria and its administration, as free and sovereign as that of the Byzantine Empire; and if he added to the title " Emperor of all Bulgarians" that also " of Greeks," he did so because it was a well-known title in his own country, which, after the conquest of Byzantine territories, included many Greeks. A second reason was that he was anxious to legalise his ambition of forming a great Balkan or Eastern Empire, with its capital at Byzantium (Constantinople). The title " Emperor of all Bul- garians and Greeks " was, moreover, necessary to him to impress the inhabitants of the Balkans, including the Greeks, with a sense of his actual power. But Simeon, who knew the true conditions at Byzantium and that the crown of the Emperor (Bart28gv) had been seized by more than one usurper, considered under the circum- stances that it morally belonged to him, and that he was justified in claiming the complete dignity and the title. To obtain public recognition, he also applied to the Pope, who promised him the imiperial crown and to bestow the dignity of patriarch on the leaders of the Bulgarian clergy. According to some historians, he received both the one and the other. In any case, Simeon convoked the Council at which the Bulgarian Bishop Leontius was officially proclaimed patriarch, and he in turn crowned Simeon Emperor of Bulgaria. After Simeon, in the time of the First and Second Empires, the Bulgarian ruler signed himself " in the Lord Christ devout Emperor and Despot of all Bulgarians," generally adding " and of Greeks." Later Byzantium readily accorded the title of Emperor to Simeon's son, Peter, after his marriage with Maria, granddaughter of the Emperor Lecapenus. Rambaud says: " Byzantium could not but recognise the title of her new ally. which had been granted to Simeon, and which had been recognised by the Pope " (Rambaud, L'Empire Grec, p. 342). At that time the Bulgarian envoys at Constantinople took precedence at various court receptions, in St. Sofia and the Hippodrome. On one occasion Luitprand, as representative of the Western (Frankish) Empire, felt such resentment at this that he left the table, but the Curopalates (Keeper of the Records) calmed him, saying:</page><page sequence="4">102 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. " When Peter, King of the Bulgarians, married Maria, a written agreement was made, confirmed by oaths, by which the Bulgarian ambassadors would take precedence over the nuncios or envoys of whatever peoples may be with us." The insignia of the imperial dignity, according to Byzantine chroniclers, were :-the throne, called the Stol, decorated with pearls; the crown, called the diadem (Simeon and Peter were crowned with a golden diadem ); the sceptre, of varying size, surmounted by a cross; the purple robe (bagrenica) which the King donned on solemn occasions; and red shoes. In the pic- tures of Emperors and Empresses there is to be seen a banner marked with a cross. The question of the royal arms was still not fully established. There is other evidence, however, that on every occasion the figure of a lion appeared in these. Supreme power was acquired in two ways: by inheritance and by election. The order of succession to the throne, according to data taken from the Bulgarian Golden Bulls, was in the male line and by primogeniture. When there was no direct issue the next nearest male in order of descent became Emperor. But there is no evidence from the sources of certain primogeniture. The old Slav Seniorate was rare. It was first practised in the western Bulgarian Empire and later under As6n's successors, Peter and Kalojan, who assumed power although Asen I. had children. The system of co-Emperors which was established in Byzantium to prevent conflicts with possible usurpers, existed also in Bulgaria. Here, however, its object was the preparation of the co-Emperor, generally " the young Tsar," for his future responsibilities. Such a co-Emperor was generally the eldest son of the previous ruler. When the line of the ruling dynasty came to an end, recourse was had to election, it being understood that the new ruler should be the founder and progenitor of a new dynasty. From Telec to Krum (76I-803) almost every ruler was elected to the throne. Krum appears to have been elected without any opposition or expressed dissatisfaction; and he founded a dynasty xvhich lasted about I50 years. Women were excluded in Bulgaria from the succession, as they were in Germany and France by the Salic Law (Lex Salica) and as they still are in Bulgaria. The order of succession was sometimes altered. Boris, for reasons of state, deposed the eldest son of Vladimir from the throne and placed Simeon upon it. Revolutions also put an occasional usurper on the throne. The loss of supreme power, except by death, occurred either</page><page sequence="5">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON. 103 -by abdication (as in the case of Boris and Ivan Alexander) or by deposition. FUNCTIONS, RIGHTS AND PREROGATIVES OF THE SUPREME POWER. After Asparuch the civil ruler was generally regarded as the first great commander-in-chief. It was his duty to lead his army in war and protect the interests and dominions of the State. Such was the Slav conception, and this appears on various occasions in the decisions of the full National Assembly. It is said that the Lord of Bulgaria never proclaimed absolute monar- chic power. He had, however, wide powers of legislation, as well as extensive juridical and ambassadorial privileges. Originally the legislation of the ruler was concerned with the settlement of various disputes, in which case the supreme power carried out the existing customary law, or, when necessary, changed some existing law or enacted a new one. Legislation of this type appears in the Bulls and in treaties. The legislation of Krum, which the Byzantine chronicler Suidas describes in his well-known Lexicon, was more or less a codification of already commonly accepted decisions concerning the penalties for (i) perjuiry, (2) theft, (3) harbouring criminals, (4) drunkenness, and (5) mendicancy. Krum proclaimed this accepted law taken at a National Assembly. After the conversion of the Court of Pr6slav, the first Christain ruler of Bulgaria, Boris Michael, asked for written laws from Byzantium and later also from Rome. As we know, Pope Nicholas I. replied in io6 and gave Boris certain directions on various religious, social, administrative, legal, military, public and private matters. He sent him also by his nuncios, Paul and Formosus, written laws, probably Alaric's Manual-Breviarium A laricianum. But after their return to Rome, owing to a mis- understanding between the two parties, by order of the Pope, Paul and Formosus did not leave these written laws and ecclesi- astical rules (leges mundanae et sacri canones) in Bulgaria because they feared " lest perchance some one should misuse them or the people distort them with some falsehood." Therefore Boris asked for and obtained certain laws from Byzantium, though little is known either of their number or of their contents. Soon afterwards, however, owing to the con- version, which fortunately for the Bulgars synchronised with the introduction of the Slavonic alphabet, the brothers Cyril and Methodius of Salonica and their disciples prepared, together</page><page sequence="6">104 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. with liturgical books, the most important collection of ecclesias- tical laws of that time-the Nomocanon of John Scholasticus, or the Novnocanon of 50 articles. In this were incorporated both the ecclesiastical and civil laws, the laws of the Byzantine Emperors. Besides this translation into Bulgarian of the canonical- ecclesiastic compilation, by Methodius-called the Zakonopravilo, but later given the name of Krmcaja Knjiga, there appeared, most probably in the time of Boris, a national legal collection called Zakon Sudnyj Ljudtim (Code of Law for the People). This code, as everything goes to show, was the work of a disciple of Cyril and Methodius, if not of Methodius himself: for the most part, it contained penal laws, taken chiefly from the Ecloge of Leo the Isaurian and Constantine Copronymus. The Bulgarian author of this Code " bulgarised " the laws adopted, and in some cases departed from the Ecloge, when the latter appeared to diverge from Bulgarian legal concepts. The Code adopted little from the mutilation penalties prescribed by the Byzantine original, and when it accepted them, as it did in the case of the penalties, it was in a modified form. It provides for the punish- ment of blasphemy, perjury, murder, arson, theft, and calls particular attention to cattle-lifting: it prescribes severe penalties for offenders against chastity, devises a system of regular legal procedure, specifies the nature and the number of witnesses to be examined in certain cases; it permitted women to give evidence and paroikoi also; it ordained that serfs in Bulgaria should be freed " by ransom or " by working themselves free it defined the grounds for divorce. In a word, it was a legal compilation adapted to the Bulgarian life of the time. It has been held that the Code is not merely a creation of the Emperor Simeon's time but is his own work, published as an official act of legislation. The Polish legal historian, Chube, upholds this contention, as do the Russian professors, Zigel and Florinsky. But there is little evidence to support their views. In Bulgaria, besides the nomocanon of 5o articles, that of I4 articles, ascribed erroneously to the Patriarch Photius, has recently become known also. The theory that it may originally have been translated by St. Sava the Serbian (c. M2g9) is probably false; it would appear, all things considered, that it is a work composed on Bulgarian soil. In any case, it cannot be so late as is asserted. Later, under Constantine the Peaceful (I258-77), a still extant nomocanon, copied in the Bulgarian patriarchate of Trnovo, was</page><page sequence="7">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON. I05 sent by request to Kiev, to the then Archbishop Cyril. Most probably also the Agrarian Law was translated in the time of Simeon, for it is the work of the Isaurians,l as is the Ecloge, and contains many regulations that would seem to be intended and published for those " free Bulgarian communities " which had become prominent in the northern parts of the Byzantine Empire, at the time of the widespread immigration of Slavs. Professors Zigel and Kovalevsky maintain that " the glorious Simeon, who ruled Bulgaria from 888 till 927, commanded the imperial books to be translated into Bulgarian; namely, the Ecloge, Procheirion and the Agrarian Law." In this and in the promulgation of other laws, Simeon showed the creative ability of many a German ruler. In tribal principalities the prince or general was sovereign. With the foundation of the Bulgarian state the sovereign's administrative power passed from the followers of Asparuch into the hands of the Khans. After the proclamation of Bulgaria as an Empire, the Emperor became the supreme administrator, exercising his powers through the greater and lesser, outer and inner boyars, clan leaders, princes and chiefs. True, some of the clan leaders attempted, as far as they could, to confirm their own independent authority, but they were not strong enough to found entirely separate and autonomous entities. Justice was administered at first by the elders and princes of the commune and later also by the tribal headmen. Legal administration was instituted by the new rulers of the Bulgarian state without, however, abrogating the old rights of the communal and provincial elders. The letter which the founder of the monas- tery of Rilo, Father Ivan, sent to Simeon's son, the Emperor Peter, is characteristic: the reverend father reminds the Bulgarian Emperor " that he should not spend state monies on his own pleasure " but on the needs of the people, " for arms and for the army," also " for the poor and needy, the naked and homeless." But chiefly that he should not " practise injustice " but should show courtesy and clemency to all and " pour forth the oil of his mercy upon all," i.e, exercise the imperial right of mercy and amnesty. The sovereign at all times led the army personally in the foremost rank and in the most hazardous engagements. He often negotiated through envoys also (apokrisiarii), a method also resorted to in Byzantium. 1 Later research has challenged this origin of the Agrarian Law.-ED.</page><page sequence="8">io6 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. THE COUNCIL OF NOBLES AND NATIONAL ASSEMBLIES. Perhaps in the earliest times, and certainly later under Boris and Simeon, the Ruler possessed a council of nobles, which is called in certain sources the Synklit or Senate. Drinov calls it the Council of State. We use the term " noble (bolyar) or imperial Council"; the term recalls the Russian boyarskaya duma. The number of the Councillors was I2. Under the first Khans these were called tarkhans and were headed by a kavkhan. The powers of this council were not strictly defined or limited. It is known for certain that it always attended and accompanied the ruler, even in time of war, and gave him advice and guidance. In the internal affairs of the country it formed courts that were set up to decide questions brought up for the decision of the ruler. In time of war it was the military Council and Court. The National Assembly also was not strictly defined and had no definite procedure, either as regards its composition, its competence or the conduct of its debates. It was not in the modern sense representative of the people. It had its origin in those widespread small " assemblies " (kupa, sutne6mu, sejmii, vece), which sat in the communes and clans and of which the representatives were the heads of households of the commune or joint family. On the extension of the state, all nobles, great and small, priests and monks and the whole people, " if wve consider the composition of the Assembly which elected Constantine Asen the Peaceful to the throne," took part in the National Assembly. It is said that at the Assemblies under Krum, Boris and Simeon, the people also were present. We must understand by this the people of the capital. The chief part in the Assembly was played by the nobles and higher clergy. The duties of the Assembly were: (i) the election or proclama- tion of a ruler, as in the case of Simeon at the Council of Pr6slav convoked by Boris himself; (2) the decision on questions of a religious nature-such as the dispute with the Bogomils and other heretics in the time of Boril (I2II) and Ivan Alexander (I350 and I355) ; (3) legislation. According to Suidas, Krum pro- claimed his laws before such an Assembly of all the Bulgarians. Boris promulgated important state measures at the Assemblies- namely, the proclamation of Slavonic as the official and liturgical language, the deposition of his eldest son Vladimir and the recog- nition of Simeon's right of succession to the throne. The Assemblies were summoned by special messengers; the president was generally the sovereign; their meeting-place was</page><page sequence="9">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON. I07 usually some square, or, in later times, a church or some hall in the palace. The decisions, it would seem, were reached without divisions, unanimously, though sometimes by coercion. The great Logothete at Constantinople asked on receiving the Bulgarian ambassadors: "How fares it with the National Assembly ? "-(Xotvov Tov Aaov)-a historical proof that a National Assembly existed. ORGANS OF CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION (ECCLESIASTICAL AND JURIDICAL). These institutions were administered by the ruler of the State, supported by the Council of Nobles and various other officials of the court. Though in the beginning they bore titles originating from the regime of Asparuch-kavkhan, tarkhan, hkopan, koluvur, bogatur, kalu-tarkhan, olgu-tarkhan, bori-tarkhan, vulijas-tarkhan, etc.-they were replaced after the Conversion by the Byzantine titles of despotes (feminine despoina), sebastokrator. These two titles were given to the Emperor's near kin, but later also to nobles who had merited them or in some way achieved distinction. The Great Logothete resembled a Chancellor of State; the Protovestiarios was the Keeper of the Imperial Treasury and Wardrobe (praefectus aerario); the Pro- tokeliatinos was the First Chamberlain at court; the Protostrator was the Court Marshal (le Grand Marechal de la Cour); the Great Primicerius presented the Emperor's sceptre; and the Protosebastos, who had no special office, was charged with various missions, mostly of a juridical nature, in which case he made use of the sebasti, only taking the role of an official by special com- mission. The Epikernias or Cup Bearer provided for the meat and drink of the table and the expenditure for this department. These court officials generally had no strictly defined duties, as they had in Byzantium. Whether these titles had been in use in the time of Boris and Simeon cannot be established with certainty; but it is probable that they were already known under Peter, in view of the influence of his Greek wife, the Empress, a granddaughter of the Emperor Romanus Lecapenus. The clans or districts, otherwise the Chora of Byzantine ter- minology, were administered by 'upans (clan leaders), to which posts at one time meritorious generals were appointed; as a result of this the military names of many places have often been -preserved. Such districts were called voevodstva, a name which lasted into Turkish times in the form vojvodaliuks.</page><page sequence="10">io8 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. The Bulls give the common name of governors (or rulers) to the administrators of provinces and divide them into " gover- nors of our Empire " and " governors ruling in our Empire." The former were appointed by the sovereign-crown officials- and the latter were those who by right of legal inheritance, or arbitrarily, possessed independent power, but did not go so far as to proclaim it. Simeon endeavoured to limit these semi- feudal rulers, and even to abolish them, for which purpose he summoned them to the capital, gave them high posts at court, and in their place appointed others as " governors of our Empire." We encounter rulers or lords called Counts (xoaqg, comes) in the sources, their provinces being termed counties (comitati). Greek sources define them as " lords possessing their own retainers." There were special clan leaders in towns called kephalii, from the Greek kephale (head), and katepani, a metathesis of kapitani. These had wide authority, administrative, judicial and financial. Among the provincial servants of the State should be men- tioned the castrophylakes-chiefs or governors of fortresses and their garrisons Under this last term we may include the alaga- tori and stratori, leaders of tens, hundreds and thousands. There were also orders of financial officials. SELF-GOVERNMENT. The earliest system of Slav society had extensive self-govern- ment: in joint families, commune and tribal groups, which were usually administered by elders elected for the purpose. Even after the settlement of the Bulgarian State the villages and village council (opistina) continued to exist under the same regime, which did not curtail their internal autonomy. At the head of the village there was a prince, mayor, chief or other elder, who together with the elected leaders made himself respon- sible for the peace and security of his district. The commune was in law regarded as an individual and was answerable for any criminal action, especially for murders com- mitted within the boundaries of the village and its lands; also for the outbreak of fires should the authors of these crimes not be discovered. This collective responsibility-guarantee, emstvo -was the foundation of village self-government. This is called vzaimoporoc'itelstvo-ruka or roka (i.e., mutual undertaking of responsibility). A similar state system of emstvo existed in the clans, which were also regarded as persons in the eyes of the law. Self-government was observed among the Bulgarian Slavs</page><page sequence="11">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON. IO9 even before the times of the Greek rulers, though to a limited degree. It was still more noticeable and widely extended during the Turkish occupation. Turkish administrators did not inter- fere with the internal life of the country. THE CHURCH. The evidence is too scanty and contradictory to affirm posi- tively the existence of paganism either in Bulgaria or among the Slav population of the Peninsula. In any case, paganism among the Slavs did not reach the anthropomorphic stage familiar to us in Greece and Rome but stopped short at animism. The few divinities worshipped by the Slavs of whom we have any satisfactory knowledge include Perun, or Svarog, and Da2bog. There were no special priests or temples. The rites were per- formed in the open air by the heads of households, village com- munes (opstina), and tribes (pleme) under some oak or lime tree. The sacrificial offerings were mostly cereals, and, as in the case of offerings to Perun, the Slavic Zeus or Jupiter, animals. Christianity brought about a revolution in the religion of the Bulgarian Slavs. An organised church, with a hierarchy and liturgical rites modelled on those of Byzantium, soon made its appearance. The conversion 'of the Court of Preslav had been preceded some decades earlier by the conversion of a considerable number of Bulgarian Slavs, who were thus early acquainted with a cult and ritual of the Byzantine type, whence also was derived the terminology of the liturgical books. For this reason the inspired work of Cyril and Methodius met with success. The priesthood of Bulgaria was already organised in the time of Boris and Simeon. It is extremely characteristic that Boris was not content that a Greek clergy or the Greek language should minister to the primary needs of the Bulgarian Church. Immediately after the conversion he took care that there should be a national Bulgarian priesthood, with liturgical books in Bulgarian. He also insisted that the Bulgarian Church should be national, independent and autocephalous, privileges which were not obtained by the Russians on their conversion to Chris- tianity (988) nor by the Serbs (gth century). Under Simeon, the Archbishop Leontius was made head of the Bulgarian Church with the title of Patriarch (919). From that time onwards the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is virtually a patriarchate and autocephalous. Though not always recognised as such by the CEcumenical Patriarchate, it has always regarded itself as an independent national hierarchy. Following the</page><page sequence="12">IIo THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. example of the Eastern Orthodox Church, the territory of the Bulgarian Church was divided into metropoleis and bishoprics. We know that at the time of the Emperor Peter there were about forty bishoprics or dioceses, under a titular bishop or metropolitan. The wavering between allegiance to the Pope and to the CEcumenical Patriarchate during the reign of Boris, and later under Simeon and Kalojan, ended in the canonical union of the Bulgarian Church with the Byzantine Patriarchate. There are no absolute data for the details of organisation of activities of the national church. It is, however, known that a complete understanding always existed between Church and State, while the Bulgarian monarch showed invariable respect for the head of the national clergy, as indeed he had reason to do. The Bulgarian Church, represented by its illustrious ministers, beginning with Clement and Naum and others of Cyril's and Methodius' disciples, did wonderful work for the development of Bulgaria, above all in the field of culture and education. With the active co-operation of Boris and Simeon, two centres of cul- tural activity were founded in Eastern and Western Bulgaria; at Preslav-Patalejna and at Kutmevica (Ohridsko)-D6vol. Here Slav letters were both widely and intensively fostered. Thanks to this activity of workers from the Bulgarian Church, the Slav world obtained a powerful literary medium, by which unity was made possible. We might almost venture to call this Cyril's and Methodius' idea of cultural unity. In this connection the services of Boris and Simeon were considerable, for they wel- comed, favoured and gave shelter and encouragement to the Moravian emigrants. As regards legislation and legal matters, loyal helpers and translators were generally to be found among the servants of the Church. Directly or indirectly they also raised the standard of justice in Bulgaria by supplying written codes and other accessories. With the spread of the Church's participation in the life of the country, a system of ecclesiastical justice made its appearance. This was represented by the episcopal and metropolitan tribunals, similar to that of the Abbot's Court. This last was the privilege of the monasteries, given to them by the Golden Bulls, which provided for the legal immunity of the clergy. The Abbot alone had the right of governing and judging all those who lived within the limits of the monastic territory, including villages given to the monastery by the Bulls. No authority (monarch) could interfere with monastic administration, nor " set foot forcibly" within monastic villages.</page><page sequence="13">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON. III The Bulgarian Church is inseparably bound up also with the artistic life of old Bulgaria. Though the earliest monuments of architecture may date back to heathen times (Aboba-Pliska), the gigantic basilicas (royal churches) at Prespa Lake, PrAslav and elsewhere-now in ruins-must belong to the Christian period. In the field of music the Church composed the so-called litur- gical " Bulgarian Chant," which has been accepted in Russia also. THE POLICE. Police organisations existed in the clan, township, village and other settlements, their object being the safety and well-being of the population. In spite of the backward state of administration, the police service was not insignificant. Krum's legislation had already aimed at checking the spread of brigandage, drunkenness and mendicancy, as prejudicial to public safety. By such measures he struck at the very roots of crime and prevented its growth. The emstvo-i.e., collective responsibility-was an old Slavo- Bulgarian custom, which existed in the villages and clans. This made the authorities of the commune or clan responsible for the damage caused by any criminal act whose authors were unknown or could not be convicted by the local police. This was specially the course adopted in cases of murder or arson. Each member of the commune or clan thus became a voluntary detective for the discovery of the author of the crime, since otherwise all were called upon to compensate for the damage done. The police particularly saw to the safety of merchants when travelling over mountain rifts and passes. Care was taken also to watch foreigners, that is, merchants, the " Empire's beloved guests," as they were called, to enable them to carry on their business unhindered. Nor does it appear that the great roads of Bulgaria, some of which dated from Roman times, were left devoid of police supervision. Thus in the I3th and I4th centuries, Constantinople could be reached in ten days, according to the accounts of Villehardouin and Hadji-Kalfa. The Emperor Alexander and his army marched from Trnovo to Rusocastro in five days (c. I333). The villages were policed by the village elders, princes and chiefs, and were assisted, if necessary, by all the inhabitants of the village or clan. Similar measures safeguarded also their well-being. The poor were cared for, housed and looked after in monasteries, so</page><page sequence="14">II2 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. that even when women were with child they did not die like dogs. Father Ivan of Rilo draws the Emperor Peter's attention to these matters when he says " Be vigilant for all classes and be acces- sible to all." FINANCE. National economy was originally merged in the private economy of the princes (later, emperors). This is readily under- stood if the attitude of the ruler to the State is borne in mind: as in all ancient states, he regarded it as his own private property. It is true that at a later period this attitude changed, giving place to one of a public-legal nature, but even then the private Imperial Treasury was not clearly defined nor divided from that of the State. Historical sources give us no exact information as to the nature of the Bulgarian ruler's revenues. But judging from other Slav monarchs in the Peninsula and elsewhere, and utilising the scanty data to be inferred either directly or a contrario, and, especially the information afforded by the Golden Bulls, we may suppose that these revenues were principally derived from the following sources: (i) private lands belonging to the monarch; (2) services (raboti) rendered free on behalf of the Treasury; (3) plunder in war; and (4) various tributes and taxes. These last were small and simple in the beginning, but became more com- plicated under the Byzantine regime. Of the royal prerogatives from which the Treasury drew more or less profit, we may mention as existing at various times: fisheries, mines, road and ford tolls. A later source of revenue was the minting of coin. The chief services rendered to the Imperial Treasury, other than military service, include the following: (i) Podvoda 1: the requisitioning of horses for the transport of the ruler's staff or goods; (2) Priselica: billeting (Turkish konak) and feeding crown agents, from the Emperor down to the least of his servants; (3) the building of fortresses; (4) supplying guards for prisons and prisoners. If, as some writers on social history maintain, the existence and upkeep of the prisons mark a more highly developed stage of culture, one must conclude that Bulgaria had already reached this stage. Regarding taxes from a modern standpoint we may say that Bulgaria had both direct and indirect taxation. 1 The requisitioning of horses is met with in other Slav countries, Later Turkish mekjare. This levy was also known in other mediaeval states.</page><page sequence="15">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SI.MEON. I I3 The direct taxes were: (a) Damnica or dimnica (Greek xanvwov), or hearth tax, which was an impost on every house- hold and dwelling (dvor): that is, on every hearth (chimney). This is the French fumage, German Raichgeld, later French tribut foncier-a sort of estate duty. (b) Volobersina, or cattle duty, paid upon .every yoke of oxen (Greek CevyaQerpxov). The cattle tax was reckoned according to the amount of land which could be ploughed by one yoke of oxen. It is equivalent to the Russian sokha. Under Simeon, according to Cedrenus, the tax for one zeugaritikon was :-one measure of corn, one measure of oats and one vat of wine. This was the sitarhija (sieve), or corn tax, and the term was till lately in common use in the neighbourhood of Greece. (c) Kosarstina, or pasture dues (travnina): i.e., the rents derived from the use of State pastures. (d) The tithe (desetukui), which was deducted from the produce raised on lands belonging to villages or households. The tithe was variously named-according to the produce on which it was levied. The monasteries were exempt from the payment of all tithes. Here, too, should be mentioned fines (pena, Russian vira) collected by special officials called globnici or globari. (a) Vrazda: this was a fine for offences against private persons, murder and the severer sort of bodily injuries. (b) Razboj: a fine for robbery committed within the village (opstina). (c) Konska Vrazda or Konski Tat: a fine for the theft of a horse or other large beast. (d) Raspust: a fine for wilful assault, desertion or separation from a wife. And lastly (e) Potka or Pocka, botka: a fine for destroying outdoor property and damag- 'ing land, especially trespass on lands set apart for meadows or tilth. Turning now to the indirect taxation, the early imposition of the kumerk should be noted. This is the Latin commercium, Greek xov[weQXov, later Turkish gjumruk. This toll was levied at various places, from which its names were derived e.g., klisura, at the mountain defiles or. passes; foros, at markets; mostnina, at bridges; and brodnina or diavaz, at fords. There were also internal customs, levied on goods transported from one province (oblast) to another. This duty existed in all feudal countries and was known in Turkish times as karagjumruk. There must have been many divergences from the regular levy of these duties, which were much reduced in the case of privileged foreign merchants. The latter were sometimes even completely exempt from paying duties, as was the case under Ivan Alexander II. and Mihail As6n, in the interests of the I</page><page sequence="16">II4 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. Ragusans. Again, sometimes a minimum 3 per cent. ad valorem, tax was levied on live stock. Thus Ivan Alexander, in according- certain privileges to Venice, made the tax 2 perpers for a large vessel and one for a small. There were special officers for the collection of taxes. These- were the pobirCii, (Russian, Croat and Czech, biri"i), mitari, globari or globnici, perperaki, while the collectors of tithe were called desetkari, or, according to their various departments, svinari, zitari, senari, vinari and pselari. Money was originally little used; cattle, horses or sheep generally served as the medium of exchange. The skins of various animals also, both raw and tanned, were much used for- barter. There is no evidence to show whether coin was minted by the Bulgarian ruler under the first Empire. Byzantine gold coinage was then used (perperi), and later other foreign money came into use, notably the Venetian gold ducat. Under the second Bulgarian Empire, a Bulgarian gold currency was minted but was very rare ; that mostly in use was of silver (be8icki, aspri) and brass. The gold coins were called zeltica, zlatica, (Greek, perperi). The pattern of the Byzantine coinage was, the one generally selected, but under Mihail Asen we have a Venetian type. However, the perper was for long the only currency recognised in Bulgaria and the neighbouring countries. At the end of the I3th century a Venetian gold ducat was worth I perpers, or i8 silver gros; and in the I4th century it was equivalent to 2 perpers, or 24 gros (dinari). There were also gros and half-gros pieces. MILITARY ADMINISTRATION. We have but scant data for the history of the army in old Bulgaria, even in the accounts of Byzantine, Arab and Western chroniclers. The Slav tribes which had at various times settled in the Peninsula possessed armies, no less than the Bulgarians who came with Asparuch. The Slav settlements in the second period (6th and 7th centuries) were made by force of arms-manu militari. They fought the armies of the Byzantines and laid siege to their fortresses, often taking them by storm. The mild and peaceable character of the Slavs is an idyllic illusion not borne out by actual facts. They were remarkable, like other nations of the time, for their warlike spirit, which occasionally degenerated into cruelty. The army consisted mainly, if not exclusively, of cavalry. In the armies of the Slavs, the reverse was the case. After the foundation of the Bulgarian State, the only standing-</page><page sequence="17">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON. II5; army was probably a small force which constituted the bodyguard of the prince (khan). Later the army was generally mobilised only in time of need, and consisted of lords (vladalci), that is to say, of ruling nobles (pronijarski boijari). They were wholly- or partly subject to the Crown and, under the accepted system of feudal times, were bound to supply the Sovereign with a certain number of soldiers, whom they themselves supported, equipped and often commanded in person. On the occasion of " Great Wars," this military levy to form the " Great Army " was regarded as obligatory, especially in the case of lords (vladalci) and " proni-- jarski boljari" (nobles). Thus some of the national folk-songs celebrate the heroism of daughters who took upon themselves their fathers' obligations and went into battle disguised. There was both a national and, especially under the second Bul- garian Empire, a mercenary army. From the " Answers to the interrogation of the Bulgarians to Pope Nicholas I.," the Code, and other native and foreign sources, the following details may be gathered: The ruler and his dukes (voevodi) bestowed great care on their arms and horses. Before going into action all weapons were carefully inspected. Negligence in the care of arms was severely punished. Moreover, should anyone, especially a prince or duke, fail to respond to the call to arms (klic or klik), his estates were declared forfeit and he himself put to death. War horses received special care and food. They were not ridden in peace-time, but turned on to rich pastures. The theft of such animals was accordingly a serious crime and punished by a heavier penalty than the theft of ordinary horses or other property. As regards costume and weapons, both for foot and cavalry, we must turn to the representations of the Bulgarian Treasure store, found in Hungary, to the " Menologia" of the Emperor Basil, and later to the Vatican manuscript of the Chronicle of Manasses in Old Bulgarian. In these pictures Krum's cavalry wear steel caps, leather jerkins with tight sleeves and girt with a leather belt having yellow fastenings, and tight trousers. A sheathed knife hangs from the belt, and a leather wallet. Some military leaders wore helmets and shields. The most common weapons were the spear, the bow and arrow and the sword. With the strong influence of Byzantium, however, these primitive arms gave place to others, introduced by Byzantine, Arab and other prisoners of war and deserters to the Bulgarian camp. Under Krum, and notably under Simeon, the Bulgarian army began to make great use of various engines</page><page sequence="18">ii6 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. of war, such as catapults, battering-rams, etc. The latter not even a strongly fortified place like Philippopolis (Plovdiv) was able to withstand. Only Constantinople was sufficiently well fortified: its walls did not give way before even the heaviest of Krum's battering-rams (one of 5,000 tali drawn by I,000 harnessed oxen). We have evidence that in early times women also took part in the fighting, generally in male attire. The Bulgarians as a rule began their battles at stated times, either early in the morning or late in the evening. They were careful to make their attacks suddenly, without allowing the enemy to suspect their intentions, and were particularly skilled in guerilla warfare. Plunder was one of the chief incentives and aims of a campaign, as it was among all nations during the Middle Ages. Directions for the division of plunder between the commander and his soldiers are laid down by Byzantine law, for example in the Ecloge of the Isaurians, and in the Code. After every victory the Byzantines had to be ransomed with large gifts and indemnities. Terval, who assisted Justinian II. to return to his capital, demanded, according to the chroniclers, as much gold and silver as would cover the palms of every soldier,-gold for the right hand and silver for the left. Such accounts as these give but a faint indication of the ransoms paid by the Byzantines. These gifts, plunder and war indem- nities, greatly facilitated the upkeep of the Bulgarian army. This was also the case in other countries. The Bulgarian army did not number more than 30 or 40 thousand men. A campaign was generally begun, and often ended, with from I0 to 20 thousand soldiers. The army was commanded either by the prince (later the Emperor) in person or by a duke (voevod). He was assisted by other generals (voevod), tisjas'tnici, solnici and desetnici (com- manders of thousands, hundreds and tens). The Bulgarians strictly observed the Slav custom of not killing prisoners. Prisoners were freed either on being ransomed or by working themselves free, as appears from the provisions of the Code. After the battle of Klokotnica (I230), As6n II. set all prisoners of war free. In the fierce struggles between the Bulgarians and the Byzantines, this rule was disregarded and both sides gave way to excesses. It is interesting to note that Leo VI. the Philosopher bears witness to the fact that the Byzantines who fell into the hands of the Bulgarians were not reduced to slavery. This is confirmed by the Code.- Neverthe- less, the warlike spirit of the Bulgarians remained. It became</page><page sequence="19">BIULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON.

By all accounts it would seem that the Slavs had some legal system and judicial procedure in their ancient home beyond the Carpathians. Even a superficial comparison of terms current among all the branches of the Slavs at that time, in their eastern, western and southern branches, will show that the legal terminology was, in its essentials, the same for all. We may suppose that the old Bulgarians who came with Asparuch brought with them different customary laws, but it is certain that no real trace of the influence of a non-Slav Old Bulgarian system can be established. Certain Turkish terms have, indeed, been adopted, but they represent new Osmanli concepts. Our customary law may have adopted some foreign elements from the early inhabitants of the Peninsula. But up to the present time no specific example of such an influence or loan has been proved. On the other hand, it has been shown by Byzantine scholars (Z. P. Lingenthal, Uspensky, Vasilevsky, etc.) that Old Bulgarian customary law exerted an influence on Byzantine legislation, e.g., in the compilation of the Isaurians' Codes, the Ecloge, the Agrarian Code, etc. The expression " law " (zakon) was introduced into Greek and Arabic terminology, though it is rare in Thessaly and Epirus; but the term Nopiog-law-is unknown either in its simple or derived forms. The Christian epoch of Bulgarian legal history introduced, together with a new religious sentiment, a series of institutions and standards, which up to that time were either unknown or differently interpreted by the people. This is especially so in matters of private rights, domestic and personal relations. Mar- riage and reasons for divorce were defined, as well as parentage. A significant change took place also as regards crime and its punishment. A special category of offences against the Faith and the Church now appeared. Sexual morality was safeguarded by more restrictions. Bigamy and polygamy were regarded as felonious acts; the abduction and rape of girls-once a normal method of marriage-was now an offence in the eyes both of Church and State. The materialistic view of crime (merely from the standpoint of the loss sustained) gave place to that of prin- ciple. It was now considered sufficient for the crime itself to exist, even though actual damage might not have been caused.</page><page sequence="20">-ii8 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW. ,Certain crimes were differentiated, and attention was drawn to the subjective factor and to the existence of intention in the committal of a criminal act. In cases of manslaughter, con- sideration was extended to the degree of provocation, to the state of mind, possible drunkenness, etc., of the slayer. Penalties for arson were graded, according as the deed was committed in a town or in a village, whether it was premeditated or unforeseen (the result of carelessness) or simply accidental. Offences against personal liberty became formally recognised as criminal acts. The punishment of crime took on a public-legal character. Private retaliation gradually disappeared. It was no longer the -injured party alone who was moved to seek satisfaction in personal vengeance or retribution. In Krum's legislation we find a gradation of penalties, beginning with the death penalty, mutila- tion, confiscation of goods, etc. This series includes (i) forms of capital punishment (execution, burning) ; (2) severe and slighter maiming (mutilation) ; (3) imprisonment; (4) exile and banish- ment; (5) confiscation of property; (6) castigation; (7) fines. Mutilation as a penalty was not approved by the legislation, and provisions for it in the Code are briefer than in the Ecloge. Many legal matters dealing with the family, inheritance and general rights of property were left to be decided by customary law. This usage was common at popular tribunals, even for the settlement of everyday disputes. The customary code is so firmly established that it predominates over many written laws and rules contained in the Nomokanon and other legal codices. These latter are often unfamiliar to the popular judges, heads of households and village mayors, and even to the clan governors, headsmen (kephalii) or captains. This undying customary code outlived not only the epochs of both Bulgarian Empires (ioi8- II86) but also five centuries of Turkish rule. The mass of the people continued to judge according to the traditions of antiquity, changed and modified to the needs of the moment. Though Turkish national, religious chauvinism in Bulgaria persecuted the clergy and attacked Bulgarian books, churches and language, the Turkish authorities, who were really cruel especially if roused by a revolt, remained passive towards the phenomenon of domestic, communal (opstinska), ecclesiastical and popular, autonomous courts of justice. We have no data concerning the instruments of justice either for pre-Christian. times or after the conversion. It, may' however, be indirectly concluded that besides the popular courts-com- munal and clan-there were also crown courts, both before and</page><page sequence="21">BULGARIA UNDER TSAR SIMEON. iI9 after the conversion. These were probably not regularised, but they none the less existed and were in actual function. The Code of the gth century mentions a council of judges and of princes and judges together. Probably also such agents of administration as the old lords (vladalci), dukes, princes, zupans, elders (celnici) and later the headsmen (kephalia) and captains ,dispensed justice as crown officials in much the same way as the English sheriff and other officials of the Middle Ages. Christianity introduced a more or less organised hierarchy of spiritual courts, to which very likely the temporal crown courts also conformed. We have the Courts of Presbyters, Bishops (Metropolitans) and Patriarchs. The Court of Presbyters was conciliatory and preliminary. The Bishops' Court tried ordinary qoffences, and the Patriarchs' Court was a court of final appeal. As at Byzantium, the spiritual courts in Bulgaria had now a wider, now a more restricted sphere of competency. Certain civil matters, such as questions of tutelage (nastojniceski), marriage, divorce and inheritance, were also decided by the spiritual courts. These were the causae spirituales et causae connexae. The ecclesi- astical courts also sat as mediatory courts, when the parties concerned appealed to them voluntarily. The Abbot's Court dealt exclusively with the affairs of the monastic clergy and laity. We know something of the procedure of courts in general from the Code. We learn that the parties were called supernici, kletvetnici (from klevetja) and topotnici, and that many witnesses were required (II, 7, or at least 3)-a circumstance which would lead to the conclusion that witnesses originated from the earlier conjurators (sukletvenici, conjuratores). Any person with know- ledge of a pact could be a witness; and the evidence of women and youths was also accepted under some conditions. The oaths taken by witnesses on giving evidence were " God's Judgment," -natemija (anathema), etc. Written evidence came into use later. The practice of private retaliation was gradually checked. In both civil and criminal departments of justice the ancient system did not always correspond to the popular idea, repre- sented in such proverbs as " A hedge may wither but not an old debt " and " Sin is redeemed by repentance and wrong seeks to be righted," indicating that sooner or later recompense must be made and the penalty paid. The duty of the court was to mete out justice to each according to his merits. (TY. N.B.J.) STEPAN BOBCEV.</page></plain_text>
