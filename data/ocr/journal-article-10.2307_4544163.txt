THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. By J. LAIRD. ? 1. I HOPE I am not abusing the high honour you have conferred on me by asking me to give this Presidential Address, if I choose as my theme a subject that is a good deal older, in its main outlines, than our fifty-year-old society. I have heard it, said, with plausibility, if not with complete truth, that the present age is noticeably liker the eighteenth century than, at any rate, the late nineteenth. This statement seems to me to be a good deal more accurate than many historical generaliza- tions-indeed, to be as accurate as is reasonably to be expected of any statement of its kind. And therefore it is a little sur- prising that so many contemporary philosophers should keep rather stubbornly aloof from the attitude implied in the great historical development from Locke to Kant. To judge from much that is said nowadays, one would suppose that the whole</page><page sequence="2">2 J. LAIRD. eighteenth-century movement in philosophy is to-day a spent force, having begum, it is true, as a bright, clear and rapid river, but tending, asiJt advanced, to lose itself in sandy futile shallows, and, in the end, disappearing in certain dank and marshy places not a hundred miles from K6inigsberg. I want you, then, to consider whether it really is so. Can we, to-day, seriously avoid asking the sort of question that Locke asked and that H-ume asked ? Here, I submit, the answer is plain. WVe cannot, and should not, avoid asking their questions, or questions very like theirs. Admitting this, however, we run upon another point of much greater difficulty. Should we, or should we not, maintain that epistemology ought to dominate philosophical enquiry, and that there must be a hysteron proteron, if we do not admit its priority in any resolute philosophical adventure having an adequate basis ? The bulk of the argument in this paper will be concerned with this latter question, and will be directed, in the main, to a general, and, I hope, to a temperate discussion of the reasons that have been, or that might be, adduced in favour of this priority of epistemology. The reasons thus alleged are, of course. so very varied, and so very different, that any attempt to assemble them, even sketchily, is likely to tend towards bewilderment. For this I apologize in advance, but I would plead that my subject has lured me into tortuous ways. When psychology, logic, and metaphysics jostle one another, any discussion is likely to be elbowed out of the straightest course. I should add, perhaps, that my principal aim is to survey the evidence rather than to occupy and defend any particular philosophical position. ? 2. In the first place, then, I submit that we cannot avoid epistemology, simply because, in Mr. Johnson's phrase, we are bound to ask epistemic questions. Moreover, it is not very</page><page sequence="3">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 3 difficult, at any rate in a general way, to indicate what epistemic questions are. To say " This is so," for example, is not obviously epistemic, although, I daresay, it has an epistemic side to it. On the other hand, to ask " How do I know that this is so ? " or " What right have I to assume, or conjecture, or believe, that this is so ? " are questions very obviously epistemic. It is difficult-indeed, it is impossible-to see how a scrupulous philosopher can avoid raising questions of the latter type, and if he cannot avoid considering such questions, he cannot con- sistently dissociate himself from epistemology. What is more, the study of epistemology must have a certain independence and distinctiveness. Epistemology, again, is very closely allied with logic, for it is one of the aspects from which all problems of proof or of evidence must necessarily be regarded. This is manifest in the case of all logicians who say that their science is a process of " thinking about thought," but it should not be obscure in the pages of those who proffer other definitions of logic. Readers of Mill, for example, who might be inclined to accept his opinion that logic is " the science of proof or evidence " may also be disposed to resent the restrictions he put upon this definition when he said that " evidence " meant " inference," and pro- ceeded to maintain that logic "in a direct way at least . . . has nothing to do . . . with the original data, or ultimate premises of our knowledge, with their number or nature, the mode in which they are obtained, or the tests by which they may be distin- guished."* Even if it were politic for logicians to neglect these questions, it would surely be necessary for philosophers to examine them. In other words, there ought to be a philo- sophical discipline called epistemology. Let us turn then to the eighteenth century in order to consider its suggestions concerning what epistemology essentially is. * Sy8tem of Logic, Introduction, ? 4. A 2</page><page sequence="4">4 J. LAIRD. ? 3. At an early stage in the Introduction to Locke's Essay we read: "If by this enquiry into the nature of the understanding I can discover the powers thereof, how far they reach, to what things they are in any degree proportionate, and where they fail us, I suppose it may be of use to prevail with the busy mind of man to be more cautious in meddling with things exceeding its comprehension; to stop when it is at the utmost extent of its tether; and to sit down in a quiet ignorance of those things which upon examination, are found to be beyond the reach of our capacities."* In this statement, a very definite epistemological programme is set forth and important results are promised as a sequel. Yet there are obvious elements of weakness in the programme. In the first place it has been suggested that the presumptuous- ness is all the other way-that it is presumptuous to suggest that anything whatsoever is unknowable, and self-contradictory to assert that we know that anything is unknowable. " It seems to me the most arbitrary dogmatism," Mr. Stout says in a recent article, " for anyone to determine a priori what is and what is not capable of being known. There is nothinig to confine knowledge to this or that part of the universe, or to anything short of the whole in its unity and in its detail," and Mr. Stout goes so far in his advocacy of the invincibility of knowledge as to say, "The problem is not-How can I know anything ? but rather-How is it that I do not know everything ? What is to be accounted for is not knowledge, but ignorance, and error, and beliefs that may or may not be true."t Mr. Stout even speaks of ignorance as diluted knowledge." On the other hand, when anyone makes claims such as Mr. Stout makes in this passage, he is not censuring, but commend- * ? 4. t Mind, N.S., No. 124, p. 393.</page><page sequence="5">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 5 ing, epistemology. For he is stating, in effect, that our insight into the nature of knowledge is such as to inform us authorita- tively that knowledge is omni-competent and wholly invincible. And this is an epistemological finding. Again, if he is less intransigeant than Mr. Stout-whose doctrine of " diluted knowledge " may not convince very many-he still may hold, with Mill, that " there is no appeal from the human faculties generally; but there is an appeal from one human faculty to another."* And this, once again, is an epistemological finding. Secondly, and perhaps even more importantly, it may be asked whether there is any genuine possibility of examining our cogitative " faculties," capacities, or powers except in their actual employment, and, if so, whether the procedure plainly suggested by Locke in the quotation given above should not be quite precisely reversed. Is it not the truth that we have to infer the scope and accuracy of our cogitative faculties from their success in actual cogitation ? Did not Locke himself do this (or attempt to do it) and nothing else whatsoever ? And in that case is not the inference both to the faculties and to their limitations very precarious ? What ultimate reason have we for supposing that our " tethers " are metaphysically inexpan- sible, and that they must confine us for ever, like hobbled ponies, to a single, comfortable, but narrow paddock ? ? 4. In many arguments of Locke's type a good deal of play is made with the suggestion that the "understanding," or any other so-called human faculty, is the "instrument " with which we know or believe; and it is suggested that any practical man tests his tools, or asks for a guarantee that they have been tested, before he begins to use them. Similarly, it is said, practical men do not use their tools for purposes to which such * System of Logic, III, xxi, ? 1.</page><page sequence="6">6 J. LAIRD. tools are plainly unfitted. They do not attempt to fell trees with a meat saw, or to saw granite with saws that are admirably suited for cutting timber. Analogies, however, are usually dangerous, and are always an oblique form of argument. It is, therefore, entirely possible that our faculties are a very special kind of instrument, or again that, although instruments, they are not mere instruments. What is more, even if the analogy held good, it may well be doubted whether it proves what it purported to prove. Naval engineers presumably make several tests before a ship is launched, and make further tests before she puts out to sea. Even so, however, the testing of her material is a testing of the material itself; and the ultimate test is what the ship herself will do. The ship is finally tested when she is doing the work of a full- grown ship; and no test of the ship-in-herself before she began to float and move could conceivably be regarded as sufficient. Similarly, of her material before she was built. The material is tested when at work. Taking the ship, then, to be an instrument for transporting men and goods, it seems plain that some instruments, at least, are tested in the performance of their function, and cannot be tested properly when they are doing nothing at all. It is possible, therefore, that this may be the proper analogy con- cerning knowledge, understanding and other mental faculties. And if we can only test our faculties when they are at work, we cannot also test them before they set to work, but can only test them in proportion as we discover what they do-which is quite a different thing. When all is said, a " faculty " is only a capacity or a power; and there is always a puzzle when we begin to ask what a power or capacity is when it is not being exercised. How, for example, could we test the accuracy of a man's visual faculties except by noting the accuracy with which he discriminates objects by</page><page sequence="7">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 7 sight ? We may infer, no doubt, from certain tests that he can see as well as other people, and therefore that he would be capable of seeing a rhinoceros half a mile away, although he never saw a rhinoceros in his life before. The reason for this inference, however, depends upon the things that other people, like to him in the use they make of their eyes, have seen under given conditions. It is not that eyesight can be tested before anything is seen at all. In short, there is no such thing as an examination of human faculties in vacuo, or, in that sense, before they operate. The most that can reasonably be alleged is that the study of our faculties in their employment gives us a certain kind of epistemo- logical insight. ? 5. It seems clear that Locke himself did not seriously think otherwise. In his view the " understanding " was essentially an instrument to see by. To vary his metaphor of the "tether," it was a lantern to guide our path or, in its higher offices, a candle of the Lord. While he believed that the human, miind, by a reflex or internal sense, could observe its own operations, and while he certainly did not believe the mind to be passive or a do-nothing, he never attempted to deduce the character of the object of the understanding from the introspective character of mental " operations." There- fore his enquiry into the understanding took a different turn from what might have been expected. In the main, he did not enquire into the understanding but into its " immediate objects " or " ideas." While officially a thoroughgoing epistemo- logist, debating the scope and limitations of our faculties and examining the understandingfirst in order to deduce its limitations, he preferred, in his practice, to infer what the understanding can do from the character of the ideas it inspects. It is only</page><page sequence="8">8 J. LAIRD. when we take him to mean that such ideas are themselves mental existences or appearances that belong to the under- standing that, for the most part, he can be consistently taken to be enquiring into the understanding at all. This interpretation is not necessitated by Locke's definition of " ideas," " species " or "phantasms," although he covertly assumed it pretty often; and, on the whole, we may suppose that he struggled against the interpretation. It was otherwise, to be sure, with Hume. According to the Scottish author, each human mind is a " heap " of mental existences called "impressions " and "ideas," or, in a single word, " perceptions." Hume did not take the step, so familiar in contemporary philosophy, and not altogether foreign to Locke's way of philosophizing, of regarding " perceptions " as "neutral entities." Therefore, he expressly declared that epistemology must come first in all philosophical enquiries, with the addendum that philosophy must be Newtonian enough to be thoroughly experimental, abolishing occult principles in the mind or elsewhere, and relying solely upon observable entities and their observable derivatives. Thus we read in the Introduction to the Treatise, "'Tis evident that all the sciences have a relation greater or less to human nature; and that however wide any of them may seem to run from it, they still return back by one passage or another. Even mathematics, natural philosophy and natural religion are in some measure dependent of the science of ma)?; since they lie under the cognizance of men, and are judged of by their powers and faculties. . . . Here, then, is the only expedient from which we can hope for success in our philosophical researches. . . . There is no question of importance whose decision is not comprised in the science of man; and there is none, which can be decided with any certainty, before we become acquainted with that science."</page><page sequence="9">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 9 This principle became firmly incorporated in the English tradition in philosophy. It is the catchword of humanism: the wearisome refrain that, being human, we can only envisage a human world: the nucleus of ego-centric, anthropo-centric or socio-centric philosophies. Among the many expressions of it, however, whether contemporary or historical, I find nothing more complete, or more pervasively interfused with the general epistemological problem than the following passage from Mill's Auguste Comte and Positivism; " The proper meaning of philo- sophy we take to be what, in the main, the ancients understood by it-the scientific knowledge of Man, as an intellectual, moral, and social being. Since his intellectual faculties include his knowing faculty, the science of Man includes everything that man can know, so far as regards his way of knowing it; in other words, the whole doctrine of the conditions of human knowledge. The philosophy of a Science thus comes to mean the science itself, considered not as to its results, the truths which it ascertains, but as to the processes by which the mind attains them, the marks by which it recognizes them, and the co- ordinating and methodizing of them with a view to the greatest clearness of conception and the fullest and readiest availability for use ; in one word, the logic of the science." ? 6. A position having so much historical importance, and regarded by so many people at so many times as so very plausible, or even as absolutely conclusive, must, one would suppose, consolidate the massive effect of many separate strands of plausibility. I cannot attempt a full analysis, extracting all the chestnuts with a cat-like dexterity of paw, but I shall try to extract a few of the more noticeable arguments which may be supposed to support such contentions. And the following seem to me rather important: (1) the argument from mental</page><page sequence="10">10 J. LAIRD. atmosphere, (2) the argument from similarity, (3) the argument from proximity, and (4) the argument from the nature of appearances. Each of these arguments attempts to show that what we call our " minds " must be better known to us than anything else and hence that a knowledge of " mind " is the great philosophical illuminant. In addition, (5) I shall discuss an argument that seeks to prove only that our minds are more easily known by us than anything else, and hence that epistemo- logy offers a more promising line of philosophical enquiry than any other. (1) The argument from mental atmosphere is a form of what may be called the contextual argument in philosophy, although not necessarily of monistic contextualism. It is at least specious to maintain that we can no more forgo our egoity in Qur cogitations than attempt to leap out of our skins; and if the ego is not mental, what in the world is mental ? In this case the argument takes a very personal turn, but it may attempt, with rather dubious consistency, to become socio- centric or anthropo-centric, and in that case may be at least as impersonal as a savings bank. The logic of all these argu- ments, however, is substantially the same, and it will suffice if we consider only one of them. For this purpose the ego- centric argument seems the most striking and the most suitable. Broadly speaking, this argument may be said to have three main varieties which are based upon the implications (a) of the ego-centric relation, (b) of the ego-centric perspective, and (c) of mnemic association on the part of the ego. (a) After so much discussion of the logic of relations as we have had during the present century, it may be affirmed with some confidence that the same relation (e.g., " greater than ") may hold between different terms, and that the identities of related terms need not be affected by the circumstance of their standing in relation to one another. It follows that, in so far</page><page sequence="11">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 11 as some object 0 stands in the relation of being known to an ego E (supposing knowledge to be or to involve a relation) it cannot be logically inferred that 0 is therefore different from what it would be if it were quite alone, or from what it would be if and when it is related to something that is not an ego at all. (b) The argument from perspective is manifestly spatial in its mode of expression, and is usually spatial in its actual gravamen. It is, in short, the argument that each of us perceives from his own point of view, and that this singularity in his position affects the whole of any man's cogitation. In sense-cognition, where our visual, auditory and other sense-apparitions manifestly do vary according to the observer's point of view, it has to be said, in the first place, that this variation is in no way exclusively mental. The same differ- ences in " point of view " affect a camera as affect a human eye-the same foreshortening, the same variation of size with distance, and so forth. It is rather the cerebro-central than the ego-centric predicament that is in question. Granting, however, that the ego is embodied, it has to be noted, secondly and more importantly, that the facts mentioned above are fully compatible, in principle, with a " selective " view of perception. It is quite possible, in other words, that from any given point of view, a different selection must be made, but, notwithstanding, that each selection is fact, and nothing but fact. To put the matter in yet another way, it is not neces- sary to assume that egoity is, in any weighty sense, projected into perceptible fact, investing such facts with a mental aura, or haze, or atmosphere. The truth may be, instead, that some particular station restricts the ego (or perhaps the cerebrum) to a particular objective selection. Even if the case regarding sense-perception, however, remained highly dubious, it would be quite illegitimate to infer</page><page sequence="12">12 J. LAIRD. that all our cogitation is determined (or vitiated) by the same sort of ego-centricity. One of the principal offices of reflective thought is to correct the illusions of private perspective, and there is no good a priori reason why the intellect should not succeed in this part of its enterprise, and achieve, not only anthropomorphic unanimity, but genuine acquaintance with things as they are. We have, no doubt, to use our human faculties, but may very well discover, by their means and yet with accuracy, what is not human at all. If we recognize, for instance, that " 3 is greater than 2," is there any genuine meaning in asserting that Jones, say, can only judge that his 3 is greater than his 2; and similarly with Smith and his Smithian 3's. and 2's. ? Or is there any way of saying that mere human 3's. are greater then mere human 2's, without also confessing that there is no authentic meaning in the statement that the number 3 is greater than the number 2 ? (c) The adjective " mnemic " (which has recently achieved a greater celebrity than it appears to deserve) describes the fact of retentiveness, either in the way of memory and explicit association, or in the unremembered, implicit way in which our experience is modified by former experience. Retentive- ness, to be sure, is in some measure a physical property, but it is in every way probable that the elaborately mnemic circumam- bience of our minds is one of the profoundest among their attributes. In so far as explicit memory or explicit association are in question, what appears to happen is that there is an expansion of the field of attention when we remember. In noticing X (which is before us) we also recall Y. This is no proof, in itself, that there is anything wrong with our apprehension of X. If, on the other hand, the stress of the argument concerns what is implicit and unremembered, it would appear that what is implicit in this way is strictly a tendency to associate or to</page><page sequence="13">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 13 remember. At the most there is incipient recall, and this, psychologically, is little more than a dawning impression of familiarity. It is scarcely to be inferred, therefore, that mere mnemic expansibility has a logically different essence from mnemic expansion. The mnemic argument, therefore, is no stronger than the the others. (2) The argument from similarity depends upon the ancient, but still active, superstition that like must be known by like, because (it is alleged) there can be no connection between dis- similars. Historically speaking, this argument, like so many of the others, was elaborated in connection with sense-perception; and it fell into the common error of confusing between sense- cognition and the physical causes of sensation. Even with regard to causation, however, it is magic, not science, to hold that causes and effects must resemble one another; and we should try to avoid the state of mind that seeks to injure an enemy by sticking pins into his effigy. In general, then, we may say that there is no more logic in maintaining that the eye must be sun-like in order to behold the sun, than in maintaining that the eye must be potato-like in order to behold a potato. Again, we have to avoid the fallacy implied in the view that knowledge consists of states of mind (even if these are, as Mr. Dewey says, " in immediate shining apparency ") and that such states of mind are true when they resemble, or copy, their objects. The lacuna here is that even if the mind were a self- conscious mirror, the cardinal feature of knowledge, viz., its apprehension of, or its reference to, an object has been completely left out. The mere fact that an image in a mirror resembles something not on the mirror does not transform the mirror into into a knower. Suppose, then, that this image leaps into "immediate shining apparency," and you are still left without any knouwledge of anything except the apparent image. In the</page><page sequence="14">14 J. LAIRD. alternative there seems to be no valid reason why, for example, the thought of heaviness should itself be heavy. The suggestion, therefore, fails on every count, and may be suspected to be a victim of the greatest fallacy of all, viz., the Gnostic fallacy that knowing and its object must ultimately be identical. We do not know ourselves simply because we exist, any more than stones do. We need not know things the better, and indeed may be less successful in our cogitative enterprises if we assimilate them into our own substance, supposing, that is, that such assimilation is possible. And to say that we cannot know what is " foreign " to us is simply to play fast and loose with the word "foreign." If the stranger is a stranger to our apprehension, then, so far,we do not apprehend this stranger. If it is merely not ourselves, or not of the same blood, there is again no reason, in so far forth, why we should not apprehend it. According to Shelley in the magnificent Platonizing of his Defewtce of Poetry, there must be a certain propinquity or affinity between the higher capacities of the mind and the True, the Beautiful and the Good. This, perhaps, is truth and an important truth. Such affinity, however, may be the union of differents. It need not be a union of the resembling, and in any case cannot be inferred from the pseudo-axiom A3imilia sirnilibus. (3) The argument from proximity is also based upon a confusion between the causes of perception, on the one hand, and the reality of sense-cognition, on the other. When our senses are stimulated, it is argued, the mind must be " in its own place," that is to say, in contact with the cortex of the brain. It cannot, in Malebranche's phrase, " take a walk among the stars." For it is under our hats. In other words, the contention is that sense- cognition is an instance of causation by contact; and hence, with a confusion scarcely to be regarded as pardonable, that although the mind, properly speaking, is aware of its own modifications only. it is yet allowed to trespass just a very little step, and may</page><page sequence="15">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 15 be held to be aware of the adjacent causes of such modifications, although never of any remote causes. This under-hat philosophy seems brimming with incoherence. There would be consistency, although little solid relevance, in maintaining that our minds are acquainted with themselves only, but there is a complete absence of consistency in attempting to combine this view with any knowledge of adjacent but extra- mental regions in the brain. If brain and mind are in contact, the brain does not therefore become semi-mental. On the other hand, if brain and mind were identical, this united entity need not be supposed to take cognizance of itself and of its immediate surroundings only. The principal fallacy, however, is to infer that because there must be cerebral excitation whenever we perceive, there- fore we perceive nothing but this cerebral excitation, or perhaps nothing but this cerebral excitation together with its incipient reverberations. Those who allow themselves to become the victims of this fallacy ought, in consistency, to conclude that the world we perceive is a cerebral world and under our hats. This cerebral world, therefore, would have to contain what we call our (physical) hats and our (physical) skulls. In other words, our heads, according to the theory, would be inside our heads. It is highly advisable, therefore, to excogitate some- thing more plausible. If anyone holds that the mind must be in its own (or in any) place, he may be invited to consider where that place is and if he asserts, as well he may, that a thing is where it acts (action in terms of this argument being the "c action " of sense-cognition) he might most logically conclude that the mind's place is wherever its cognition carries it. In other words, when it perceives the sun, its place, then, is in the sun. The mind, however, is so much more than sensory, and the argument from proximity (if it does not forthwith join forces</page><page sequence="16">16 J. LAIRD. with the identity argument we have already considered) is so exclusively sensorial that we need not linger over this contention any longer. (4) The argument from appearances may be stated as follows: (a) In all our cogitations we cannot be concerned with anything except appearances. Such appearances may be shams, but they may also be authentic or veridical. The business of science and of philosophy alike is to save the genuine appearances and to eschew the shams; and there can be no proper challenge to these statements (it is contended), provided that the term " appearance " is under- stood widely enough and defined in such a way as to include logical, inferential, and also introspective appearances as well as sensory apparitions. This being understood, the ancient adage holds univer- sally: De non apparentibus et de non existentibus eadem est ratio. (a3) All appearances are mental. According to Hume, as we have seen, the mind consisted of sensory, and of passional appearances together with their echoes in imagery, and was indeed a " heap " of such appear- ances. Let us grant, however, that Hume was wrong both in his description of appearances and in his view that the appearances are loose and separate, consti- tuting a "' heap." It still remains true (we are told) that our appearances are somehow mental and also personal. (,y) An appearance must be what it appears to be. This is said to be an identical proposition. Anything that seems so and so mutst seem so and so.</page><page sequence="17">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 17 From (13) and (,y) taken together it follows that such part of our mental equipment as consists of appearances must be better known than anything else, because it must be known quite infallibly, on pain of contravening an identical proposition. From (a), (/3) and (y) taken together it follows that everything thinkable consists of appearances and must be what it seems to be, i.e., is infallibly apprehended. Clearly, there is something wrong somewhere in these con- tensions-indeed, something mischievously wrong. Sound argu- ments cannot so betray themselves; and I should like to suggest that all the three steps in the above argument are mistaken. The statement that something appears to us when we are aware of anything (and consequently that appearances and awareness are co-extensive), may seem innocuous so long as we are dealing with what is true. Even in this case, however, it is illegitimate to argue that because something or other seems such and such, therefore it presents a distinct entity, its seeming or appearance, to some knower. And in the case of falsity it is surely plain that there are no such entities. Suppose, for instance, keeping to Mr. Russell's well-known illustration, that I believe that Charles I died in his bed. In that case, according to this theory, there would have to be a real, although false entity, Charles's death in his bed, appearing to me. Another form of the same fallacy-which, as it happens, has been very common in European philosophy from Greek times onwards-is the view that every distinctive form of human cogitation specified a distinctive form of " object." Thus, let us suppose that Jones opines something, that Smith believes it, and that Robinson knows it. According to the fallacious view we are now considering, it has to be inferred that there are three distinct entities in the case, viz., Jones's oppinatus, Smith's creditum, and Robinson's cognitum, or, still more fallaciously, B</page><page sequence="18">18 J. LAIRD. that Jones's opinatus is a real piece of half-being, Smith's creditum a real piece of three-quarter being, and Robinson's cognitum a real piece of full being. Actually, all these inferences are false. There is only one thing that Jones opines, that Smith believes and that Robinson knows. The only difference in fulness is the fulness with which each of them has severally grasped the same thing. And although we often have to admit that our cogitative grasp of things may be very imperfect, we never (unless we are the dupes of a theory) attribute these limitations to things themselves. In short, we are never entitled to conclude that because X seems such and such, there is therefore some intermediate epistemological entity, the seeming of X, which stands between us and X, and is the mental apparition that we know. For the same reason it is illegitimate to infer that " appear- ances " are necessarily mental. If a stone wall appears to us, what appears may very well be part of the surface of the stone wall; and there need not be anything mental about this part of the wall. The same objection, in principle, must be made to the very common argument that, at least in our consciousness, seeming and reality must be identical. It does not follow that because we are conscious, we must therefore inevitably discern what our consciousness is. On the contrary, the greater part of intro- spective psychology is directed, with fitful and wavering success, towards this very discernment. The introspective psycholo- gist's entire orientation is towards the nuance in his own con- sciousness; and these nuances are not at all easy to discern. We are conscious; but it does not therefore follow that we apprehend, fully and accurately, what our consciousness is. I have now examined, and disputed, four ways in which it may be contended that epistemology comes first in philosophy, because our minds are necessarily better known to us than</page><page sequence="19">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 19 anything else and govern all other knowledge. Perhaps, how- ever, I need not have been so particular. In one fashion or another, these arguments have a common core, for they all assert that what is " inner " is obviously intelligible, whereas anything " outer " is obviously very hard to understand. As Dilthey* says in various places, " Die Natur ist uns stumm.... Die Natur is uns fremd. Denn sie ist uns nur ein Aussen, kein Inneres. Die Gesellschaft is unsere Welt. . . . Ihr Objekt setzt sich aus gegebenen, nicht erschlossenen Einheiten, welche uns von innen verstiindlich sind, zusammen; wir wissen, verstehen hier zuerst, um allmahlich zu erkennen." I submit that the whole of this idea is prejudice, ultimately due to a confusion between knowing and being. It is not true, in my view, that our mental nature is given us, from the first, as something necessarily understood and comprehended through and through, and that our business is gradually to construct a more extended, although less intelligible, " science " on the ultimate foundation of this inner psychological knowledge- whether Mr. Eddington says this, or Mr. Dilthey, or Mr. Hume. ? 7. (5) It may also be contended, however, by a different argument, that our minds are more easily known to us than anything else, although not necessarily better known on that account; and that epistemology is, accordingly, a philo- sophical enterprise much more manageable than ontology. This argument really is different from the former in its principle, although it is frequently confounded with the former. It is quite conceivable, for instance, that some entity X might be more easily although more superficially apprehended in one way, and that this same X, or some other Y, could be appre- hended with greater difficulty, but more profoundly, in some * Einleitung in die Geisteswissenschaften, pp. 37 and 109.</page><page sequence="20">20 J. LAIRD. other way. Indeed, regarding material things, it is very usual to encounter arguments of this species. Thus, most of the Cartesians appear to have held that the natural and the easiest drift of our thoughts was towards a superficial acquaintance with the physical world, but that, in thoughts more profound, we knew ourselves far, far better than anything else. Male- branche, indeed, was a notable exception ;* but, being an exception, he was not typical. We are concerned now with the inverse argument, viz., that the task of enumerating and examining our faculties is at any rate manageable. For our faculties are comparatively few, and are probably exhaustible in number. The vast ocean of being, on the other hand, is utterly inexhaustible. Obviously, this view might readily be challenged on certain assumptions. It is, for example, opposed to the spirit of the Coherence View of Truth, or, as we might say, to Contextual Monism; for the contextual monists assert that everything with which we are acquainted is relative to its context, and consequently that all such acquaintance is provisional and, indeed, mis-acquaintance in any context short of the whole. In brief, according to their argument, we cannot apprehend anything truly unless we apprehend everything completely. And even granting that we are capable of separating the relevant from the irrelevant in the context (and so that acquaintance with a limited object may nevertheless be accurate), or, for that matter, granting with Dr. Schiller and other advocates of con- textual pluralism, that a makeshift or provisional knowledge is all the knowledge we ever get, it may well be true that we should have to concede something at least to the argument with which we are now concerned. It might, and should, be objected, of course, that Kant, Hume and others exaggerated the ease with which, as they * Recherche de la ve'rite, Book III, Part ii, ch. 7.</page><page sequence="21">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 21 supposed, we could obtain a complete and final inventory of the powers of the mind. How could we rightly deny, for instance, that some new type of object, some fresh adventure of the mind in its cogitations, might reveal capacities hitherto undreamed of ? The mystics frequently inform the rationalists that rationalistic inventories are always wofully incomplete, while admitting that such inventories may very well be as nearly complete as any consistent rationalist could make them. They are the best, we are informed, that the intellect can do. If so, it is possible at least that the mystics are not mis- taken. And might there not be mystical or other suggestions of this kind in infinittum ? Nevertheless, I think, we ought to give a qualified assent to the argument. It is easier to make a fairly accurate chart of the mind's principal capacities in the way of knowing, than to attempt to map out the territory of all existence with any approach towards the same degree of completeness. On the other hand, it is always a delicate question how far such charts are primarily and predominantly charts of the mind. Logical relationships, for example, while they indicate certain capacities of our apprehensive faculties are also general properties that all existence must contain. So far as they go, therefore, they are quite as truly charts of being (or ontological maps) as they are charts of the mind. ? 8. A resume of the contentions of this paper, up to the present stage in it might run somewhat as follows: (a) That epistemology has to be studied because there really are epistemic questions. (b) That such a study is distinctive in its purpose and point of view. (c) That a certain weight should be attached to the con- tention that the study of our faculties is more</page><page sequence="22">22 J. LAIRD. manageable than many ontological adventures; but (d) That it is impossible to study our faculties in vacuo. They can only be legitimately studied in their use. (e) That an inductive study of this kind is not a deduction from the nature of our faculties. (f) That there is no good reason why our minds miust be better known than anything else; moreover, that most of the "reasons " alleged in support of the last contention are very bad reasons indeed. ? 9. It is necessary now, for the remainder of this discussion, to say something of the " high priori " way of arguing these matters, or, keeping as before to the historical path, to consider Kant as well as Locke and Hume. As Mr. Metzger has recently shown with great skill,* Kant, by predilection and by training was a Metaphysiker, that is to say, his fundamental bent was towards an enquiry into the supersensible, regarded as the timeless, invisible, and rational ground of all that is. Therefore, Kant held that any genuine science must consist of principiata e principiis and must be completely deductive as well as completely intelligible. The same pre-connection in his thought determined his view both of the priority and of the nature of epistemology. Up to the end, in this matter, he adhered to the doctrine he succinctly expressed in his Dreams of a Ghost-Seer. " In reality," this passage ran, " all kinds of concepts must be drawn from the inner activity of our spirit as from their source. External things may very well contain the condition under which they are assimilated according to this or the other kind, but cannot * Der Geqenstand der Erkenntnis, Part I1I, Jahrbuch fur Philosophie, vol. vii.</page><page sequence="23">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 23 supply the essential energy required for their actual appre- hension." In this crucial respect, Kant's epistemology is in the fore- front of his philosophy precisely because he was a Metaphysiker. His position, in this matter, was seldom substantially different from the view of Leibniz (published posthumously in 1765) in which the a priori is said to be a law of co-ordination. " Opus est interno mentis principio, per quod varia illa secundum stabiles et innates leges speciem quandam induant." Essentially, then, Kant held that the things of reason cannot be outside our rational faculty, but, on the contrary, must be the constructions of that faculty. That, and that only, is intelligible which is produced by reason, and has its source in reason. The super- sensible is not outside us; for we, in the invisible but essential part of us, are the supersensible itself. Therefore, the study of productive, creative reason must come first in any intelligible philosophy; and the product of reason which is science and knowledge must be deduced from the character and operations of reason, that is to say, from the mind. I find Mr. Metzger's commentary so very apposite that I have to beg your indulgence in allowing me to mention him again. As this commentator explains,* Kant thought of reason " in three different ways. The rational for him was (a) the opposite of the contingent or the merely factual. It was the intelligible that whose fundamental nature evinces necessary connection. (b) The rational, in Kant's pages, was that which proceeded from the logical or intellectual faculty. It was pure lucid spontaneity, not anything passive, or given in sense-experience. (c) Occasionally, and in a manifestly sub- ordinate sense, Kant regarded the rational as the deducible, and therefore opposed it to anything intuitive, even when the intuition was self-evident. * Op. cit., pp. 722 sqq., note.</page><page sequence="24">24 J. LAIRD. On the whole, Kant was mainly concerned with " reason" in the second of these senses. For he believed that the second sense governed and determined the first. He could not see any meaning in supposing that reason could adapt itself, or should ever attempt to adapt itself, to anything foreign, to anything outside reason. "Tecum habita," he said of us and of it. Instead of being ectypal or constrained by some outside pattern, " reason," he thought, must necessarily be archetypal, and produce its fruits from its own substance. Hence Kant's general conception of what pure reason had to do, if it did anything at all. Kant also assimilated the third sense of " reason " to the second, however, precisely because he held these matters not to be intuitive but to require an elaborate " deduction " or vindication. His question therefore was, " How can reason of itself pro- duce a necessary connection, and, in its us7bs realis, construct a science of the existent ? " Part of his answer was, that by itself alone it would be only analytic. The rest of the answer (or, rather, the most notable part of it) was that " reason " is able to generate a necessary, synthetic connection in an alliance with sensibility, and particularly in alliance with the pure festhetic forms of space and time. This is the doctrine of the two " roots " of scientific knowledge. As everyone knows, Kant's philosophy diverged very widely indeed from what he called the " dogmatism " of Cartesian rationalists, and of Leibniz, Wolff and Baumgarten. In the end, Kant abolished the sciences of God, of Freedom and of Immortality (i.e., any demonstrable and completely certain knowledge of the traditional type of metaphysics) in order to make room for a (rationally justifiable) belief. The only demonstrable knowledge we can have, he maintained. is the purer moiety of natural knowledge. There are, strictly speak- ing, no sciences except pure mathematics, together with what</page><page sequence="25">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 25 Kant considered " pure " physics; and there is knowledge in these cases simply because our sensory presentations, or some of them, are wholly amenable to the rules of the logical under- standing. They conform to the grammar of our reason and bear its stamp of universality and necessity. On the other hand, the forms or rules of our reason, if they have no matter to inform (or no adequate matter) are condemned to beat in the vold. Nevertheless, as I have argued, Kant was always a Meta- physiker in the cardinal respect that he held science and know- ledge to be the product of reason, and to be guaranteed as science or knowledge precisely in so far as the pure spontaneity of reason could be shown to be their source. He differed from the Cartesians in maintaining that man's sensory nature was not diluted or confused reason, but the offspring of totally different genes and gametes; yet he also agreed with the Stoic, scholastic and yet more ancient tradition which asserted that our reason was always the governing part of mind, and itself a divine thing, belonging to the corpus mysticum that supersensibly governed the universe, and, like the mythical and traditional fifth element in the heavenly bodies, of a wholly different order from anything earthy or carnal. According to Kant, if and so far as reason was lord and master in its own house, that is to say in the mind, the result was rational know- ledge. Otherwise there was darkness and mere animal faith. Outside the house, except with regard to other pure intelligencies, reason could produce nothing; and therefore it remained aloof from everything out of doors. Again, when anything is traced to its source in our reason the whole problem of epistemo- logy, knowledge and evidence stops forthwith. In Kant's view, there is nothing else to be considered at all. In short, Kant, like the others we have mentioned, argued also from the ego-centric standpoint, but, unlike those others, c</page><page sequence="26">26 J. LAIRD. interpreted the ego in a thoroughly rationalistic way. The ego became, on his showing, the unity of constructive logic. It was, therefore, neither private nor personal in any ordinary sense, but a Bewusstsein iiberhaupt, or a consciousness in general. The ego-centric standpoint coalesced with the logico-centric and the esistence of science was said to be proved, in all cases, by ascertaining the fact of its logical pedigree. If so (although Kant did not say it) the most significant question in all philosophy would be the status of our acquaint- ance with our pure spontaneity, our constructiveness, our activity. The " new " idealists, like Signor Gentile, have, of course, taken precisely this step, although in a way that pro- perly horrifies all who are accustomed to identify reason with the supersensible, the invisible and the eternal. " If we would know what we are," Signor Gentile says, " we must think and reflect on what we are; finding lasts just as long as the construc- tion of the object which is found lasts."* Thus, the atto puro is very like a mens mornentanea. ? 10. I do not propose to examine the views of these rebels, but I must pause, although briefly, to consider the prevalent opinion that our activity must be known to us with a clarity and certainty that cannot be reached elsewhere. Even if this is the old, old story of a covert identification of knowing with being, it is at least a different preface to the story. In general, what is contended in this argument is that the nature of our voluntary activity is very plainly comprehended by us. In the external world, it is said, the sequence of cause and effect is, so to put it, mere brute sequence. Dip the blue paper in the acid and it becomes red. Here we have an in- variable, but not an intelligible, sequence. It is otherwise, * The Theory of Mind as Pure Act. Eng. trans. p. 23</page><page sequence="27">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 27 however (we are told), with our volitions. In their case, we know what we mean to do, what our purposes are. And it is intelligible (is it not ?) that we should accomplish what we mean to do. Ex post facto, at any rate, and in case of success, we can understand why certain results come about. The mere existence of serious willing shows that we have an intelligent and intelligible grasp of the situation. These statements are plausible, but I think they will not bear the closer kind of scrutiny. We cannot " grasp " a situation except on the basis of experience. If we know, or have reason to believe, that we can distinguish, say, between what we can move and what we cannot move in the external world, we may then proceed to make kinetic adjustments, but not otherwise. If we know what in our bodies (e.g., our limbs) we can move, and how far and how fast we can move them, we may then proceed to adjust our bodies. And similarly we may adjust our minds if we know the kind of control we can exercise over our thoughts and imaginations. The whole of this distinction, however, between what we can do and what we cannot do, has to be learnt; and the distinction itself is just a " brute " fact, like any other brute fact of a general sort. There is no differ- ence in principle between learning by experience how far a gun can shoot, and learning by experience how far a man can jump, or afford to joke. Even if we had first-hand acquaintance with the efficacy of volitions, however, in a sense much liker clear intelligibility, and much less like brute fact than seems actually the case, there would be a considerable deflection of the argument when our cogitative and speculative activity became the theme of debate. Speculative activity is not identical with voluntary action; and if pure activity, activity without any admixture of passivity, is the crux and core of the discussion, there is a most serious dubiety whether we are acquainted with pure activity</page><page sequence="28">28 J. LAIRD. either in ourselves, or in our minds, or elsewhere. Our acquaint- ance with our bodily activities is obviously not non-sensory. It is, on the contrary, guided by postural and kinaesthetic sensa; and although these should be distinguished from " pure " mental activity, it is very questionable indeed whether such pure mental activity is not known rather by inference than by any direct and unequivocal revelation. ?11. In any case a reference to the origin of some species of cogitation in spontaneous or constructive reason could, at the best, solve a part only of the relevant epistemological problem. This " high priori " way of arguing, while it is capable (on its own terms) of telling us a great deal about what reason does, need not be equally ready to give us any clear understanding of what reason is. In terms of such arguments, reason is the order-producing principle, and logical necessity or logical universality is its sign-manual. It is, therefore, easy to tell (according to the argument) when and where reason has been at work, as also to declare where it is indispensable. These contentions, however, are quite consistent with the further view that the principle of order is in itself unknowable, or, at any rate, unknown. We infer the operation of an order- producing principle, because we are compelled to recognize orderliness in our experience, but the super-sensible ground of orderliness may, nevertheless, be hidden from us. There is much in Kant's philosophy to suggest that this was his ultimate principle. The real work of the ego was done behind the scenes. And it is certain that Kant sharply distinguished between the formal or logical unity of self-consciousness, on the one hand, and any knowledge, either of the " empirical ego " through the " internal sense," or of the noumenal, supersensible or rational ego, on the other.</page><page sequence="29">CONCERNING EPISTEMOLOGY. 29 If so, the rational mind, or the logic-producing principle, so far from being better known than anything else, would, on the contrary, not be known at all. To be sure it may.well be contended that this attempt to distinguish between orderly intelligibility and the principle of such orderliness, is itself a dropping of the substance and an effort to pursue the shadow. What I am maintaining is only that this "high priori " way of demonstrating that epistemology comes first in these affairs is itself in great danger of being but a shadowy highway. ? 12. Finally, it is seriously to be questioned whether a logico- centric presentationism is ultimately to be preferred to any historical, personal and ego-centric presentationism. I do not pretend to know how Kant answered Hume, or whether Kant did answer him; but there is a prevalent opinion to the effect that Kant's answer took the following course: We have to distinguish within our mental appearances those that have a scientific significance from those that do not have it. Without the former the latter would be a mere chaos, incapable of yielding the foundations even of Hume's system, e.g., that I am seeing something now. If so, it has to be said that the arguments we have advanced concerning " appearances " apply with the same force to so- called " significant " as to so-called " non-significant " appear- ances, to those that have a logical stamp as well as to those that have only a personal and private stamp. In short, the object of knowledge can never be reduced to the status of being a significant kind of appearance. If it were so reduced it would be a referent shorn of one of its relata. It would be the logical mind-in-relation-to . . . and then silence. This philo- sophy would forbid the completion of the aposiopesis. D</page><page sequence="30">30 J. LAIRD. If our reference to an object were only a reference, there would, so far, be no object. There would only be an attitude of mind, whether or not this mental attitude were charged with, say, the necessary or the universal stamp. It is only when our significant experiences succeed in acquainting us with objects themselves that there is knowledge, properly speaking, at all. To distinguish within experience between experience of a neces- sary kind, and experience of some other kind, is no solution, however helpful it may be towards making the beginning of a solution. On the contrary it leaves us with a mass of baulked cogitations, all awaiting the starter's pistol, all incessantly fidgetting, but none of them running the race.</page></plain_text>
