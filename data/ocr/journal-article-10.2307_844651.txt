<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Realist Critique of Constitutionalism in the Era of Reform by HERMAN BELZ* Constitutional realism as a basic approach to the study of pub- lic law and government in the United States had its origin in the rejection of static, legalistic conceptions of the nature and function of the constitution in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Seizing upon the ancient distinction between law and fact, and operating on the assumption that the first step toward effective re- form was to describe things as they are, scholars such as Woodrow Wilson, J. Franklin Jameson, and Henry Jones Ford dissented from the reverential approval usually accorded the American constitu- tion. Rather than blaming bad men for preventing theoretically sound institutions from working properly, they laid to the constitu- tional system many of the political and governmental difficulties of the gilded age. In their very conception of the nature of the consti- tution, moreover, realist critics abandoned the formalistic, juristic view of traditional constitutional theory. Instead of defining the constitution in static terms as a code of law, they viewed it in polit- ical institutional terms. The changing relationships between the branches or parts of government, the role and influence of political parties, legislation of an organic character which altered the struc- ture of actual government or the exercise of governmental power in derogation of written law-these were the kinds of problems that concerned constitutional realists. Employing an evolutionary rather than a mechanistic model, they described the constitution of govern- ment as the effective distribution and actual exercise of power-a shifting complex of laws, formal and informal rules, governmental processes and political philosophical understandings. America had an unwritten constitution, and it was this rather than the documen- tary charter which demanded more careful and scientific study if political progress were to be realized.' Realist insights into the function and effect of constitutions and laws in the conduct of politics were of course not altogether *Department of History, University of Maryland. 1.

The attempt to construct a polity on the basis of a written fun- damental law had for a century stimulated lawmakers and states- men to consider the relationship between constitutionalism and political action. The worthlessness of paper guarantees, given cer- tain circumstances, was well understood. The significance of con- stitutional realism as a mode of interpretation was not only that it broadened the forum within which these questions were raised. In the nature of their work as scholars, teachers, publicists and in- tellectuals constitutional realists also offered a different kind of public forum from the more narrowly political one in which these matters had previously been dealt with. This is to call attention to the fact that the realists were leaders in the attempt to establish his- tory and political science as professional scholarly disciplines in the late nineteenth century. Though obviously and intentionally not divorced from political concern, they sought to bring objective and scientific knowledge to bear in their efforts to effect change. It is not necessary to credit their use of the scientific method with a high degree of success in order to appreciate the importance that constitutional realists had in the development of a modern way of looking at politics. Their inductive, empirical, pragmatic, and melioristic approach, with emphasis on the actual functioning of the political constitutional system, remains one of the major meth- odological alternatives in the study of politics.2 Constitutional realism in the latter years of the nineteenth century formed the basis for and was continuous with a more far- reaching and critical attack on constitutional law and institutions in the era of reform. In the 1890s the transformation of limited judicial review into judicial supremacy gave courts a seemingly decisive position in the governmental system. Accordingly, as legis- lative and party institutions were the main concern of the early realists, judicial power absorbed the attention of realist critics in the progressive period. Insight into the political and social dimen- sion of court actions that had always been available was made into a theory of judicial decision-making by proponents of a sociological jurisprudence. Consideration of the judiciary as the linchpin of tra- ditional constitutionalism in turn led to a more conscious explora- tion of the motivating forces behind constitutional and legal change in general. What most impressed realist critics in their analysis of this question was of course the seemingly pervasive influence of economic interests. This discovery became the basis of criticism of the very idea of constitutionalism itself. The traditional constitu- 2.

Constitutionalism appeared to be essentially a defense of existing property rights and economic power which prevented effective political action. Events of the 1920s tended to confirm this judgment and led constitutional real- ists to adopt an increasingly cynical attitude toward a system of politics theoretically based on the rule of law. Rejecting the con- servative constitutional ideal, they stressed the sense in which gov- ernmental affairs turned upon the political will and action of men rather than the automatic operation of impartial law. In thus em- phasizing the need for political action and governmental energy constitutional realists helped prepare the way for the renewal of the reform movement in the 1930s. As early as the 1880s scholarly interest in the courts had be- gun to increase as the traditional practice of judicial review was expanded past all previous limits into the broad instrument of so- cial and political control known as judicial supremacy.3 Although the judiciary in the progressive era lent its support to certain as- pects of the reform movement, its great potential power as well as its demonstrated power in the service of egregiously conservative causes, as in the Lochner, Adair, and Dagenhart decisions, invited attack. The burden of the constitutional realist critique was that courts usurped the power of popularly elected legislatures in their irresponsible exercise of the review function. Appreciation of the uniquely political character of the Amer- ican judiciary was fundamental to the constitutional realist out- look. In English law, Charles Grove Haines explained in an early essay, courts traditionally decided controversies between persons and administered relief or punishment. In the United States, how- ever, the existence of written constitutions as the basic govern- mental law and the legalistic tendencies they encouraged, led the judiciary to depart from this limited role and become involved in politics. Written constitutions being regarded as a means of pre- venting governmental tyranny, it seemed reasonable that courts should maintain and apply them as though they were ordinary law. And yet, Haines pointed out, prescriptive constitutions were much more than instruments of ordinary private law: they were primarily a form of political law, interpretation and application of which led judges to consider problems of political theory. The upshot was that American courts were "continually called upon to deal with ques- tions that [were] purely political and governmental; to enter par- 3. Arnold M. Paul, Conservative Crisis and the Rule of Law: Atti- tudes of Bar and Bench, 1887-1895 (1960).</page><page sequence="4">1971 CRITIQUE OF CONSTITUTIONALISM 291 tially at least into the realm of legislation; and to discuss questions of political, economic, and social theory." 4 Within the political context outlined by Haines the legislative character of judicial action was a common theme in constitutional realist analysis. In a highly critical assessment, Brooks Adams viewed constitutional interpretation as an essentially political func- tion. It brought about a fusion of law and politics, he observed, but this tended "to lower the courts toward the political level" rather than elevate politics. Adverting to the enormous growth of judicial power in the 1890s, Adams distinguished between acceptable judi- cial review in which a court might declare a legislative act to be beyond the scope of its granted powers, and judicial supremacy by which it might declare an act to be unreasonable.5 The political scientist Walter F. Dodd similarly stressed the recent tendency of courts to usurp legislative power by judging the reasonableness of legislation. One of the most important developments in the nation's unwritten constitution, Dodd observed, was the courts' invasion of the field of public policy and their quickness to declare unconsti- tutional almost any law of which they disapproved. The traditional presumption of the constitutionality of legislation had thus become meaningless, especially in the field of social and industrial regula- tion. And the law itself became more uncertain as results depended not on fixed rules, but on individual opinions of judges on political and economic questions. Dodd urged courts to leave the determi- nation of policy to the legislature while themselves construing con- stitutional provisions broadly and liberally.6 While criticism of the conservative political character of con- stitutional interpretation was implicit in these discussions of the judicial process, other realists took a more direct approach. In The Spirit of American Government (1907) J. Allen Smith attacked the judiciary as the most anti-democratic part of the constitutional sys- tem. Professing to be the guardians of the fundamental law, the Supreme Court actually controlled and shaped that law by its power to annul the legislative acts of the people. Although Smith was chiefly critical of the lack of political democracy in the system, he also pointed out that protection of economic interests had been the central purpose of the constitution from its very origin. In particu- lar judicial review was intended to secure the political power of 4. Charles G. Haines, "Political Theories of the Supreme Court from 1789-1835," 2 Amer. Pol. Sci. Rev. 221-24 (1908). 5.

Seeking to clear away the mystery enshrouding the Court, Myers called it "the one all-potent institution automatically responding to . . . and en- forcing" the demands of the dominant capitalist class.8 Though centering on the judiciary, these assessments added up to an indictment of the constitutional system as a whole. In the late nineteenth century constitutional realists had decried the lack of efficient and responsible administration; in the era of reform they charged further that the constitution was being made to serve the economic and political purposes of an exclusive minority rule. J. Allen Smith's entire book was an attack on the reactionary con- stitution. In part Smith referred to anti-democratic and irrespon- sible tendencies produced by such obstacles to majority rule as the amending process, judicial review, and the system of checks and balances. But he also had in mind the economic self-interest of the wealthier classes who supported the movement for a new govern- ment in 1787 and had determined so much of its operation since. The liberty that the framers were concerned with had mainly to do with property rights, he wrote, and "the American scheme of gov- ernment was planned and set up to perpetuate the ascendancy of the property-holding class in a society leavened with democratic ideas." 9 A few years later Charles A. Beard presented seemingly irre- futable proof of the anti-democratic and conservative foundations of American national government in An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution. Beard's thesis was that the politics of the 1780s were dominated by a deep-seated conflict between a popular party based on paper money and agrarian interests, and a conservative party centered in the towns and resting on financial, mercantile, and personalty interests. He held that the latter, suffering under the Confederation government and failing to achieve reforms through the prescribed channels in Congress, went outside the existing legal framework to adopt "a revolutionary programme"--the con- stitution of 1787.10 Through the critical studies of Smith and Beard, to name only the most prominent examples, property inter- 7.

The intellectual basis of constitutional realist criticism was a revolt against legalism and juridical formalism. The late nine- teenth century had seen a beginning of this critical reaction in analysis of the constitution centering on the actual operations of political and economic institutions. Continuing to view the consti- tution as a dynamic political process, realist critics after 1900 studied the interaction between law and politics with special refer- ence to the forces that motivated constitutional change. This search ultimately led them to consider the nature and effect of constitu- tionalism itself. Given their disposition to reform, they viewed exist- ing constitutional arrangements as the result of men responding to specific political pressures and concrete economic forces, rather than the necessary outcome of reliance on right principles of polit- ical science. Frank J. Goodnow's Politics and Administration (1900) illus- trated constitutional realism at the descriptive, institutional level. A colleague of Beard's on Columbia's faculty of law and political science, Goodnow argued that customs, political forces, and espe- cially the administrative system shaped government far more de- cisively than did the formal constitution. In his attempt to describe "the real political life of the people," he pointed out for example that the ideal of a separation of powers did not accord with the constitu- tional reality. The people, the legislature, and the executive all shared the function of expressing the will of the state in legislation, while courts, executive departments, and administrative agencies executed the will of the state." Goodnow also rejected the fa- vored juridical conception of a static political system resting on natural rights principles. Social progress, he believed, depended on getting courts and other agencies of government to view the consti- tution not as fixed, immutable rules, but as a set of general princi- ples whose application should take into account changing social conditions.12 Goodnow extended the realist approach begun in the years after Reconstruction. The more distinctive contribution of twentieth century constitutional realists was to illuminate the motivating forces behind the political law by which the nation was governed. Beard's was of course the most famous exploration of this theme, having an impact such that Robert L. Schuyler could write in 1916 that while the economic interpretation was occasionally over- worked, "its claim has been securely established and must be rec- 11. Frank J.

Goodnow, Social Reform and the Constitution, 2-4, 6 (1911).</page><page sequence="7">294 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF LEGAL HISTORY Vol. XV ognized by all sober-minded students of the past." 13 Important also were studies which pointed the direction that Beard would take. In 1907 J. Allen Smith wrote that while the political system and economic organization were interrelated and interacting, "constitutional forms are always largely the product and expression of economic conditions." "The Constitution was in form a political document," Smith asserted, "but its significance was mainly eco- nomic." 14 In legal scholarship Brooks Adams and Melville Bigelow illustrated the drift toward a sociological jurisprudence which rejected the notion that principles of right and justice were the basis of the law. Legal principles, Bigelow wrote in 1906, were "only the resultant of conflicting forces in society" that were mainly economic.15 A particularly significant realist contribution, which Beard acknowledged as an influence on his own work, was made by the philosopher Arthur F. Bentley. "I am engaged simply in showing," Bentley explained in 1908, "that the use of specific forms of soul-stuff gives us absolutely no help in interpreting the doings of social men." Political and constitutional principles were precisely the "soul-stuff" which most needed demolishing in this view. Pressures and interests were the causes of social change, not abstract ideals, and law itself was not a resultant of government, "it is government," Bentley concluded. Law was an activity, a group process, a struggle, an adaptation of group interests just as gov- ernment was. 16 Beard regarded An Economic Interpretation of the Constitu- tion as especially important for introducing into American histo- riography, and into the constitutional and legal field in particular, an "analysis of determining forces." Critical of traditional constitu- tionalists for neglecting economic elements, he wrote: "It is neces- sary to realize at the outset that law is not an abstract thing . So far as it becomes of any consequence to the observer it must take on real form; it must govern actions; . . . Separated from the social and economic fabric by which it is, in part, conditioned and which, in turn, it helps to condition, it has no reality." Consti- tutional law had seemed to be a special branch of law, Beard noted, because of its concern with the control of government. In reality, however, the main business of government was to make rules de- termining property relations in society. In this context Beard went so far as to define the constitution as "the social structure by which 13. Robert L. Schuyler, "Agreement in the Federal Convention," 31 Pol. Sci. Q. 290-92 (1916). 14.

Yet even then the constitution was "a secondary or derivative fea- ture arising from the nature of the economic groups seeking posi- tive action and negative restraint." It was against this theoretical and historiographical background that Beard went on to argue that the founding fathers represented distinct economic interest groups and were not operating "merely under the guidance of ab- stract principles of political science." " According to this point of view, then, the ultimate reality in constitutional affairs was eco- nomic forces, and the constitution, however broadly defined, was no longer a primary datum in understanding political and govern- mental history. This insertion of social and economic forces into the fore- ground of historical analysis was the principal development in constitutional studies during the era of reform. The change can be seen in the assessments of constitutional history presented to the American Historical Association by William MacDonald in 1907 and James G. Randall in 1929. Certainly MacDonald took a broad view of his subject. Recognizing the interaction between law and social forces, he pointed out that Supreme Court decisions were more than technical expositions of legal doctrine; they registered stages of social progress and were points of departure for subse- quent governmental action. MacDonald also saw, however, an antagonism between the constitutional or legal element and other factors in history. Thus he expressed concern that social and eco- nomic aspects were being overemphasized "to the neglect of the part which law has played in determining the course of our de- velopment." Despite a certain breadth of view MacDonald still considered constitutional history essentially the history of constitu- tional law decisions, a position which other historians criticized on the ground that in many instances such decisions were merely formal. 18 The anti-formalist attitude found full expression in James G. Randall's 1929 analysis of constitutional history. Defining his field as the study of civil processes based on critical examination of civil and governmental data, he distinguished it from the history of constitutional law. It was no subject for a legalist whose concern for the forms of law blinded him to the essential forces that worked through the law. In Randall's view constitutional history had sig- nificance insofar as it supplied material for the social historian. "It is well to seek out the social motives constituting the reality of 17.

Annual Report 1907, 79-80 (1908).</page><page sequence="9">296 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF LEGAL HISTORY Vol. XV which constitutional arguments are but the reflection," he stated in Constitutional Problems under Lincoln (1926). "Only so may we preserve the important study of constitutional history." Thus whereas MacDonald viewed law as a kind of autonomous and determining, though socially conditioned, force in history, Ran- dall saw it as essentially derivative and subordinate. He doubted that any significant issue could be said to be primarily constitu- tional."' Harry Elmer Barnes summarized the realist critique of traditional constitutionalist thought: "Political and legal concepts and institutions are looked upon as either originating in the void anterior to man or society and gradually setting down and mingling with humanity, ... or as developing mysteriously, and independ- ent of any non-political influences in society." As a result conven- tional constitutional histories were in Barnes' view "devoid of life, reality, and true instructiveness." 20 In discounting the inherent importance of constitutional issues Randall and Barnes did not speak for all students of public law and government. Although it had received serious challenge, the legal- istic, juridical approach was by no means given up as a lost cause in the era of reform. Responding in part to the threat presented by the economic interpretation, traditional constitutionalists reexam- ined major developments in American constitutionalism. In the early 1920s Charles H. McIlwain and Randolph G. Adams reinterpreted the American Revolution along the lines of legal and constitutional theory rather than social and economic analysis. Although recognizing an intricate network of economic, social, and political causes of the revolution, McIlwain considered them "non-essentials." At bottom the revolution resulted from a colli- sion of different conceptions of the constitution of the British Em- pire. Taking a narrow legalistic view of the matter, McIlwain attempted to show that the American interpretation of the imperial constitution was the correct one in the light of legal precedent. This essentially legalistic consideration he treated as the dynamic force in the minds of revolutionary leaders. 21 Randolph G. Adams was chiefly concerned with the problem of imperial organization in international law, but his study of The Political Ideas of the Amer- ican Revolution assumed from the outset that fundamental consti- tutional principles were the key to understanding the American 19.

Although Adams did not deny a so- cial and economic dimension to the revolution, he did not regard it as central. Recognizing the distinctiveness of their society, Amer- icans demanded a reorganization of the empire based upon the facts of the economic world. Englishmen, however, could not grasp the Americans' ideas that authority must be distributed and that law must be sovereign. "When a given political form can not be made to respond to the demands of an economic situation," Adams wrote underscoring the primacy of the constitutional question, "it is not always the economic situation which is at fault, or which will be changed. . . . [T]he empire was broken by its own rigidity." 22 A focal point for traditional constitutionalism was the problem of the founding fathers. In 1905 Andrew C. McLaughlin presented the classic statement of the conservative nationalist view of the constitution-making period. According to McLaughlin, the new con- stitution was the work of men who with "a reckless disregard of political obligations" appreciated the national danger existing in 1785 and were able to settle the problem of imperial or continental political organization inherited from the British.23 In 1913 Max Farrand, after editing three volumes of the records of the Federal Convention, treated the formation of the constitution as an attempt to deal with the problem of a confederated republic, in particular the defect of excessive power and independence in the states.24 And after the publication of Beard's researches, Charles Warren as- serted flatly that historians who left out political and nationalistic factors, contending that the framers were moved mainly by eco- nomic considerations, utterly failed to interpret their character and acts. According to Warren, the idea of the convention arose from "a patriotic desire for a united Nation," and from a conviction that without a new constitution "a dissolution of the Union and dis- appearance of republican government were inevitable." 25 One of the ablest representatives of the constitutionalist posi- 22. Randolph G. Adams, The Political Ideas of the American Revolu- tion, 196-97 (3rd ed. 1958). Charles M. Andrews also adopted a constitu- tional interpretation of the Revolution. The problem that had to be dealt with, he wrote, was not mercantile subordination, but rather "the very constitution of the British empire." The Revolution came when the British were unable to make concessions meeting the Americans' consti- tutional demands (The Colonial Background of the American Revolution, 206, 217 [1924]). 23.

A professor of political science, Corwin had received his doctorate in history, and his writing, never that of a mere legalist, combined knowledge of public law with an historical appreciation of the political circum- stances surrounding constitutional change. Although critical of reactionary tendencies in Supreme Court decisions and sympa- thetic to reform, Corwin's most important work before the 1930s sup- ported the traditional view that the exercise of government power must always be subordinated to objective, rational principles. This was the point of his well known study, The Higher Law Background of American Constitutional Law (1927), in which he traced the origins of judicial review as a means of restraining government through fundamental law.2" Another defendant of constitution- alism was Benjamin F. Wright, who in a study of natural law think- ing criticized constitutional realists' tendency to dismiss the im- portance of political ideas. In order to prove that natural law is an outworn concept, he reasoned, "It is necessary to show that political philosophy has no need of a concept which is expressive of stand- ards of right and justice other than, perhaps higher than, those set forth in the positive laws. . . ." Wright acknowledged the value of knowing the actual workings of political institutions in order to shape their future growth. Yet the most complete analysis of the actual system could not in his view provide "standards or criteria of justice, equity, political right." 27 In 1932 Andrew C. McLaughlin published The Foundations of American Constitutionalism, a series of essays which epitomized the traditionalist constitutionalist outlook. Far from being narrowly legalistic in his writing, McLaughlin reflected the influence of the constitutional realism of the late nineteenth century. He had con- cluded an earlier work on the relationship between political parties and the constitution with the judgment that "The development of these associations is the greatest fact in our constitutional his- tory." 28 But, insisting on the primacy of constitutionalism and the rule of law, McLaughlin did not agree with the more advanced position of constitutional realists in the age of reform. The economic interpretation of history he could not accept. In his presidential ad- dress of 1914 to the American Historical Association, he noted that "many of us are even now looking out upon the field of constitu- tional history as a branch and only a branch of economic history." 26.

Church covenant, colonial corporation, social com- pact, constitutional convention, the division and separation of power, the right of judicial review-all figured in McLaughlin's account of how Americans in the revolutionary era "made . . . an- cient theories, of which they were entirely conscious, into actual institutions." And the quintessential feature of the constitutional settlement achieved was limited governmental authority. This was what the reign of law meant, and it required that a preeminent place be given to the judiciary "to announce the law and to decide controversies according to law." McLaughlin further asserted that in exercising the right of review courts were not acting as umpires superior to legislatures and dictating to them; they were merely fulfilling their duty "to find and declare the law." 32 McLaughlin's impressive achievement notwithstanding, the ideas of traditional constitutionalism had lost their intellectual power and appeal for a growing number of public law scholars. In consequence a defensive attitude often characterized the constitu- tionalist position. It can be seen, for example, in the Constitutional Review, a journal edited throughout the 1920s by Henry Campbell Black and dedicated to the affirmation of orthodox legal values.33 Shortly before suspending publication in 1929 the Constitutional Review featured an essay by Alpheus T. Mason which tried to medi- ate between traditional constitutionalism and the realist critique. Mason, who later gained renown as a liberal constitutionalist, 29. Andrew C.

Constitutional interpretation, he observed, was "determined not so much by the document itself as by the influences which soci- ety brings to bear on the judicial mind." Yet it was quite as true that this did not mean that American government was not a govern- ment of laws. "The Constitution does provide the rules of the game," Mason continued, "and the judges can never proceed to lay down whatever decision seems best to them on the grounds of reason alone." Although the notion of a government of laws could not be accepted uncritically, Mason believed it to be an accurate descrip- tion of the American constitutional system.34 Other students of public law and government voiced emphatic disagreement as they questioned the very concept of constitution- alism. Unable to see that the idea of a government of laws and not of men had ever worked in America, they ceased to define the con- stitution as a legal code the main purpose of which was to limit governmental action. The word "constitutional" lost its normative content and became merely descriptive: every country had a con- stitution, and this was not principally a form of legal restraint, but the arrangement and actual exercise of governmental power. Ar- thur F. Bentley put the matter succinctly when he wrote: "The con- stitution is always what is."35 In explaining human affairs, moreover, realist critics considered constitutional ideas and rules less important and less real than social and economic forces. Many shared the belief of James G. Randall that "laws and constitutions have importance not in themselves, but because of the social pur- poses which they embody." 36 Several works written in the 1920s challenged traditional con- stitutionalism. Typical was Howard L. McBain's The Living Consti- tution, published in 1927 by the Workers Education Bureau Press. A Columbia Law professor, McBain attacked the idea of a govern- ment of laws on the ground that law had no life of its own, but merely a borrowed life from the actions of men. Though it suggested arbitrariness and instability, a government of men was the inevi- table result to which attempts to establish the rule of law tended. Scornful of legal formalism McBain pronounced: "The constitution of the United States was not handed down on Mount Sinai by the Lord God of Hosts. It is not revealed law. . . . It is human means. The system of government which it provides can scarcely be read 34. Alpheus T. Mason, "Ours-A Government of Laws and Not of Men," 13 Constitutional Review, 197-203 (1929). 35.

Merriam, the noted political scientist and reform leader, dis- missed political and constitutional theorizing as "more or less thinly veiled propaganda of particular social interests." A nation's consti- tution, he explained, consisted not of words alone, but of public atti- tudes and habits; it was a general understanding as to ways of doing things political. And it was delusory to think "that there is magic in the written word, apart from the situations of which it is a part." Yet that was the meaning of constitutionalism to many people."3 Conservatives' firm identification with the written fundamental law led realist critics to become cynical toward constitutionalism. When they did so they sometimes seemed to lapse inconsistently into the static, legalistic conceptions of their adversaries. The phi- losopher A. K. Rogers seemed to do so in defining constitutionalism as the belief in "law as an entity existing apart from the hesitating opinions and wavering wills of men in a higher realm of pure rea- son." What was so baneful about this outlook was its tendency to stifle the spirit of social experiment. "We have been trying by the constitutional ideal to keep things from changing except within narrow limits," Rogers complained. Skeptical of the central premise of constitutionalism, he questioned whether particular forms of law and legal process were necessary to the guarantee of liberty and other basic values.39 William Bennett Munro's The Invisible Government (1928) also assumed an anti-constitutionalist posi- tion. Munro questioned the validity of the separation of powers and checks and balances doctrine as a safeguard for liberty, and the belief that the constitution guaranteed a government of laws and not of men. Rejecting the idea that constitutions and laws could compare in their importance to social, economic, and personality forces, Munro invoked William Penn's famous dictum: "Govern- ments are like clocks; they go from the motion that men give them." Thus a government of laws and not of men was an impossibility: the rule of law was a mere fiction of political fundamentalism.40 Realist disillusionment with constitutionalism was only too apparent in J. Allen Smith's gloomy analysis, The Growth and Decadence of Constitutional Government (1930). Originally in- tended to restrain arbitrary power, constitutionalism, Smith argued, 37. Howard L.

Through the fiction of a government of law bound by constitutional limitations which it was the special duty of courts to enforce, conservatives had kept the people from recognizing this truth. Political apathy was an important further consequence of what Smith called "the prevalent anthropomorphic conception of the Constitution . . . as the guardian and protector of the rights of the people." Constitutionalism resting on the fiction of the rule of law in Smith's view precluded an intelligently critical attitude to- ward politics; it blinded people to the need for political action.41 In actuality then the national government had unlimited, irre- sponsible power, and the rights of individuals who dissented from the social and economic consensus were in jeopardy. Smith called the new conception of the state a doctrine of governmental abso- lutism.42 Cynicism about the rule of law was further evident in the treatment of constitutionalism in The Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, the monument of progressive scholarship that was pub- lished in the early 1930s. Constitutionalism was not, as it was for Edward S. Corwin, the limitation of arbitrary government through the rule of law, with roots reaching back to ancient and medieval times. Rather, according to Walton H. Hamilton, "Constitutionalism is the name given to the trust which men repose in the power of words engrossed on parchment to keep a government in order." Not only was this definition extraordinarily truncated, seeming to deny constitutionalism historical actuality or validity, it was based on the simplistic, formalist view of the constitution that realists criticized in other contexts. Hamilton, professor in the Yale Law School, identified his subject with the attempt to limit irresponsible authority, but dated it only from the first American state constitu- tion of 1776. Although he considered the writing of fundamental law an important political invention, its disadvantages outweighed its benefits. Constitutionalism offered exact language as a test for official conduct, Hamilton noted, yet it did so "at the risk of imposing outworn standards upon current activities." With fine impartiality he pointed out that an unwritten constitution was no more certain to adjust politics to popular needs. Nevertheless, his central con- 41. Ironically, the same criticism came from the conservative James M. Beck, who complained that "our very dependence upon a written Constitution and our mistaken belief in its static nature and its self- executing powers has tended to deaden the political consciousness of the American people" ("The Changed Conception of the Constitution," 69 Proc. of the Amer. Philosophical Soc. 111 [1930] ). 42. J.

Even more serious, "constitutionality" in Hamilton's view blocked popular legislation and shackled the present to the past.43 In 1932 two great works of constitutional history appeared which summed up the point of view and achievements of three decades of progressive scholarship. Louis B. Boudin's Government by Judiciary and Charles Grove Haines' The American Doctrine of Judicial Supremacy were to constitutional realism what McLaugh- lin's Foundations of American Constitutionalism was to traditional constitutionalism. Boudin in a long and distinguished career com- bined the roles of socialist theoretician, labor lawyer, and consti- tutional historian and commentator.44 Government by Judiciary, an historical account of the Supreme Court's use of judicial review, was a powerful attack on the judiciary as an undemocratic insti- tution committed to the defense of a conservative social and eco- nomic order. By no single dramatic step but rather by a gradual and continuous process, Boudin argued, the judiciary encroached upon the legitimate rights of legislature, executive, and people. The result, which Boudin and a good many other progressives had sought to overcome, was "Judicial Despotism": a government "with all powers lodged in an irresponsible judiciary." 4 Boudin also reflected constitutional realists' preoccupation with economic forces. Judicial decisions were not controlled by the constitution, he insisted, but by the "general outlook on life, chiefly economic life," of the judges involved. Constitutional disputes were thus decided according to "some economic or political assumption or predilection S. . as to what is desirable or undesirable in legislation." Like other constitutional realists, Boudin also questioned the idea of constitutionalism. Not only was American government a govern- ment of men, because of the absence of restraints on the judiciary 43. Walton H. Hamilton, "Constitutionalism," 4 Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences, 255-59 (1935). 44. In addition to his activities as a member of the Socialist Party of America Boudin gained recognition for his study, The Theoretical Sys- tem of Karl Marx (1907). 45. In 1911 Boudin argued that the major issue facing the country was the question of the limitations on the judicial power to annul legis- lation. Referring to the expanded judicial review of the 1890s and after he asked: "Shall we permit this great revolution in our political institu- tions to take place undisputed?" ("Government by Judiciary," 26 Pol. Sci. Q. 238-70.) Although Beard in his The Supreme Court and the Con- stitution (1912) tended to defend judicial review as part of the original constitutional settlement, most progressives criticized it as a departure from the framers' intentions.</page><page sequence="17">304 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF LEGAL HISTORY Vol. XV it was a government of irresponsible men. Professing faith in "old- fashioned democracy," Boudin believed that judicial power rested on popular ignorance of the actual workings of the government. When the people learned what was happening to them, learned "the true inwardness of this system," as Boudin put it, they would demand genuine self-government.46 Charles Grove Haines' study of judicial supremacy was more moderate in tone, as befitted its academic provenance, but it was equally critical and realistic in its conclusions. First published in 1911, The American Doctrine of Judicial Supremacy in the revised and enlarged edition of 1932 summarized the era of constitutional realism. Although Haines recognized limitations on the judiciary which Boudin disregarded, he agreed that the courts exercised every form of governmental power: legislative, executive, adminis- trative, as well as judicial. "What may be termed government by the judiciary, . . . or the supremacy of the judiciary, is unques- tionably the most significant principle of the politics and public law of the United States," Haines asserted.47 Most of the book surveyed in objective, scholarly fashion the growth of judicial power and its conservative political and economic significance. A final chapter, however, attacked fictions about judicial review and the idea of a government of laws. Rejecting the "mechanical theory" of constitutional interpreta- tion, according to which courts merely discovered and applied legal principles, Haines subscribed to the theory of "free legal decision." This referred to a judicial process influenced by a judge's con- science, training, and experience, as well as by general social conditions. It also included, however, the idea that courts could consciously shape the law in accordance with their perception and evaluation of dominant social trends and needs. Though this appealed to some progressives, its suggestion of social engineering was inconsistent with the democratic and anti-judicial outlook of most constitutional realists, including Haines. His solution, if courts must inevitably perform a legislative function, was to insist on closer scrutiny of the political and economic affiliations and views of judicial nominees. Like Boudin, however, Haines preferred a drastically restricted power of judicial review. Betraying perhaps a naive view of the character of constitutional interpretation, he urged judges to confine themselves to "the normal function of defining and applying the express requirements of written con- stitutions, concerning which few serious controversies arise." And like most constitutional realists he hoped that trust in the people 46. Louis B. Boudin, Government by Judiciary, v. 1, iv-x (1932). 47.

Ironically, however, the realist point of view that invigorated con- stitutional studies could become a reason for abandoning the field. Skeptical toward constitutionalism, realists ultimately denied the significance of constitutional principles, theories, and rules as causative forces in history. They concluded, with James G. Randall, that constitutional issues were not real issues.4 Now although Randall claimed that a realist approach was the only way to pre- serve constitutional history as a worthwhile subject of study, it was more likely that viewed in this way the field would become irrele- vant. For if constitutional issues were but a superficial manifes- tation of economic or social reality, it was understandable that scholars should study this reality at first hand, rather than once removed in its legalistic reflections. Randall himself turned away from constitutional history to general Civil War history, contribu- ting to what one constitutional scholar saw as the growing neglect of the field.5' Constitutionalism, meanwhile, came to seem a false and trivial issue. The cynicism that could result when the insight of constitutional realism was translated into a general historical account was evident in Howard K. Beale's view of the coming of the Civil War. "Constitutional discussions," he wrote, "determined nothing. They were pure sham. . .. For all the heat and bombast of their enunciation, these constitutional arguments were mere justifications of practical ends." ~' If the constitution were viewed narrowly as a formal legal code which only obscured real motives, as Beale in this instance viewed it, constitutionalism as a field of study might well be judged irrele- vant. Yet not even Beale was able to dismiss constitutional consider- ations when seen in broader, more political terms. In describing the history of Reconstruction, for example, he held that the Radical Republicans sought to replace the traditional scheme of checks and balances with a centralized parliamentary system. This, he de- clared, was not "mere embroidery for more practical desires," but a "fundamental constitutional issue that in importance outranks the 48. Ibid., 500-04, 538-40. 49.

The realists' ambivalence on this point arose from their reform-inspired criticism of the social and economic reality behind the conservatives' legalistic constitu- tion, which operated alongside their broad, political institutional approach to the study of public law. Traditionalists like McLaugh- lin who accepted the primacy of constitutional issues in essentially legalistic terms, experienced no such ambivalence. Though taking a cynical view of the conservatives' rule of law, constitutional realists like Smith, Boudin, and Haines did not relinquish altogether the constitutional symbol. What they did was to try to fill it with a different content. In general, realist critics were unreconstructed democrats who in their scholarship sought to provide an intellectual basis for political action that would re- vitalize constitutional government. This meant energizing govern- ment to make it responsive to social needs and accountable to the popular will. "The real difference between despotism and consti- tutional government," Henry Jones Ford wrote in 1918, "does not lie in limitation of power but in the existence of means of enforcing responsibility." Ford saw "nothing but deceit in the notion of main- taining republican institutions and democratic government by limitation put to the scope of authority." Like most of the realists he would recognize "the inevitable fulness of power" and insist on its responsible behavior.53 Constitutional realists thus hoped to infuse American constitutionalism with a new content of positive, responsible government. By the start of the 1930s their critique of traditional constitutionalism helped provide the intellectual frame- work for the constitution of powers that the New Deal created. 52. Ibid., 211. 53.
