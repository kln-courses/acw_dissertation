<plain_text><page sequence="1">364 Art. XVI.?Early Buddhist Symbolism. By Robert Sewell, Madras Civil Service, F.R.G.S., M.R.A.S. In his "Tree and Serpent Worship/' our late honoured Vice-President, James Fergusson, called attention to the similarity observable between certain symbols found on the Buddhist Topes of Siinchi and Amartivati, and others found on sculptured buildings and coins of Western Asia and Eastern Europe; and in doing so ho expressed a hope that this subject would be taken up and developed by other writers. Discussing the origin of the object known as the triiula1 he said, "It is curiously like the sign of the planet Mercury, or the caduceus of the god of that name; and, if it were not rank heresy even to hint at such a thing, I would venture to suggest that, after all, there may be some connexion between at least the symbolism of the East and West." And later on in the same work tho author records the following opinion, in a note on an old Buddhist legend which mentions a Prince of " Rom," 2 " It would be absurd to found any serious theory on the mention of the name of Rome if it stood alone and unsupported. The circumstance mentioned in the narrative of the strangers being white men and coming by sea is a small confirmation that the people here mentioned were really Europeans. My impression, however, is that few who are familiar with the arts of Rome in Constantine's time, and who will take the trouble to master these Amaravati sculptures, can fail to perceive many points of affinity between them .... The conviction tho study of these sculptures has forced on my mind is that there was much more intercommunication between the east and west during the whole period from Alexander to Justinian than 1 Op. cit. pp. 115, 116, ond note. 3 Id. p. 177, note 3.</page><page sequence="2">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 365 is frequently supposed, aud that the intercourse was especi ally frequent and influential in the middle period, between Augustus and Constantine." My attention has for some timo been given to this subject, but residence in India, inability to consult proper works of reference, and press of official work have hitherto prevented my preparing any paper regarding it. Continued study has, however, not shaken my belief in Fergusson's accuracy, and I hope to be able now to show some reasonable foundation for the theory that most of the early Buddhist symbols, whose origin is not directly traceable to indigenous Indian sources, may have been derived from earlier prc-existcnt Western Asian forms, introduced into India during the centuries that elapsed between the Aryan immigrations thither and the first construction in stone of places of Buddhist worship. The first point to which attention must be called is the political connexion between India and the countries of Western Asia during the period in question. Very little has 3ret been learned from Indian sources of the early history of India before the time of Chandragupta (b.c. 319). But it seems certain that the country, formerly populated by Turanian hordes, was overswept by Aryan im migrations which brought into India the religion of the Vedas, and, partly by force of arms, partly by the tyranny of priestcraft, ousted the Turanians from civil and religious government. The Aryans, however, powerful though they may have been, never succeeded in crushing out the old Turanian religious beliefs and superstitions. Down to the time of Siikya Muni, though the Vedas may represent the faith of the more elevated and civilized few, fetichism, demonolatry ?or rather the fear of demons, leading to demon propitiation ?a rooted belief in the existence of snake-deities, fairies, and goblins, and in the power of mystic incantations and charms, had, as it has to this day, firm hold of the ignorant and lethargic masses. Had pure Vedism been the faith of the people, there would have been little need for a Buddha.</page><page sequence="3">306 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. The era of Chandragupta may bo regarded as identical with the era of Alexander for present purposes. Professor Rawlinson has shortly summed up in the following words the condition in pre-Alexandrian times of Western Asia, of the country, that is, bordering on India:1?"For nearly a thousand years, from tho formation of the great Assyrian Empire to tho death of Darius Codomannus (330 B.C.), Western Asia, from the Mediterranean to Afghanistan, or even to India, had been united under ono head, and ac knowledged one sovereign. Assyria, Media, Persia, had successively held the position of dominant power." Alex ander broke up this unity, and the effect of his schemes was " to introduce in the place of a single consolidated empire, a multitude of separate and contending kingdoms/9 The kingdom of Chandragupta in India was one of these. Previous to his date, during the period when Western Asia was united under tho successive empires, the whole of what we now call Hindustan was divided amongst a number of petty chieftains, mostly at enmity with one another, and probably looking on tho vast empire on their immediate west as all-powerful. Is it not possible, or rather, is it not probable, that during this period the inhabitants of India had been drinking in the ideas and superstitions of their great neighbours P It is certain that Northern India had, before the time of Alexander, been subject to more than one invasion from the West; and if there were any com mercial activity at all, it is quite possible that tho Hindus of that date had in their midst colonies of foreign traders ?traders glorying in the fancied possession of superior civilization, and proud of the political ascendency of their nation and sovereign. If there were no commercial activity, how is that th? Vaiiyas, or merchant-class, came to hold such an important position as they undoubtedly did in tho body politic of a Hindu State P Setting aside the mythical invasions of India by the Assyrian Seniiramis, and Diodorus's problematical account 1 Sixth Great Oriental Monarchy, p. 29*</page><page sequence="4">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 367 of tho expedition of Sesostris ? both of which accounts, however, point to the existence of a belief amongst the Greeks that India was a country that had lain open to, and had suffered from, invasions long anterior to that of Darius Hystaspis, and serve to show that the Greeks, at least, did not consider such a state of things at all im probable, whatever may be the opinion of writers of the present day,?we have evidence that in very early days there was an interchange of commercial relations between Western Asia and India. Dr. Burnell holds it as not to be doubted that India even traded with Egypt in very early times.1 But there is no necessity for present purposes to go further than Asia. Sir Henry Rawlinson has pointed out that the early Chaldcean inscriptions make frequent mention of the "ships of Ur," and imply that they navigated to considerable distances. It is not improbable that these ships carried gold from India. Gold could be obtained from both Africa and India, and it was lavishly used in decoration.2 The Phoenicians also traded with India by sea. Professor Rawlinson3 points out that for ten centuries prior to the reign of Selcukos Nikator, from a date, that is, as early as the beginning of Assyrian ascendency, tho precious metals and the most valuable kinds of merchandize had been flow ing from every quarter into the region governed by that monarch. Gold, tin, silks, pearls, spices, and other articles of commerce, had been passing into it from India since the foundation of the first Assyrian empire in the fourteenth century b.c. Whatever may have been the exact date of the Homeric poems, it has been repeatedly noticed that the early Greek bards were acquainted with tin and other articles of Indian merchandize, and. called them by their Sanskrit names, and that the Hebrew chroniclers of King Solomon and of the reign of Hiram of Tyre used Indian names for Indian products. 1 Rurnell's South-Indian Paleography, p 3. 2 Rawliuson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. l. p. 101-2. 8 Sixth Oriental Monarchy, p. 33.</page><page sequence="5">368 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. That gold was largely exported from India in very early days has been inferred from a number of corroborative facts. MM. Perrot and Chipiez l write: " From objects found in tho excavations, from inscriptions in which the Assyrians boast of their wealth and prodigality, from Egyptian texts in which the details of tribute paid by the Roten-nou, that is, by the people of Syria and Mesopotamia, are given, it is clear that in tho great days of Nineveh and Babylon, those capitals possessed a vast quantity of gold, and employed it in a host of different ways.These accumulations were continually added to, in the case of Babylon, by the active commerce she carried on with the mineral-producing countries, such as the Caucasus, Bactriana, India, and Egypt." The period of Solomon, or say 1000 B.C., is generally con sidered to have been one of great commercial activity, but it seems unreasonable to assume that that monarch largely increased the trade of the world. Wo are induced to lay more stress than is perhaps warranted on the commerce of Solomon's date, on account of the high position ho holds in the Jewish Scriptures. It is probable that the trade which glorified his age had been carried on with similar briskness by his neighbours for some centuries past. Tho period of Solomon is ono that witnessed the decadence of the great Assyrian Empire, and a corresponding rise to a state of pros perity of the hitherto obscure Jewish nation. This ascen dency was, however, very short-lived. Solomon, so it would seem, carried on by tho aid of the Phoenicians and with con siderable success the old-established eastern commerce. There is little reason to think that he originated or greatly increased, during his very short spell of domination, a commerce which had been non-existent or scanty in previous years. From the days of Solomon we must pass to those of tho second Tiglath-Pileser of Assyria, of Shalmanezer IV., and of Sargon, the same that carried captive tho Ten Israelitish tribes, removed them to the cities of " Halah and Habor on 1 History of Art in Chaldaa and Assyria, Armstrong's translation, vol. i. p. 125.</page><page sequence="6">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 369 the rivor of Gozan and into tho cities of tho Modes," and placed Assyrians and Chaldocans in the cities of Samaria.1 The empire of these sovereigns would seem to have extended as far east as the Indus. The period is b.c. 745-708. The Biblical account of the religious changes introduced by these conquests into Samaria, and the effect of Jewish influence in tho further east, is pertinent to tho present inquiry. It shows tho estimation in which the Assyrians held the gods of their neighbours, and vice vcrsd. It points to religious toleration, and to a state of religious thought and belief such as would directly tend to the acceptance by one people of the superstitions and symbols of their neighbours. The Chaldooans and Assyrians who were sent westwards to inhabit the desolated cities of Samaria informed their As syrian sovereign after their arrival that things were not well with them, that they wero suffering, so they believed, from the displeasure of the " God of tho land " because they did not worship him aright, they " knew not his manner;" " therefore he hath sent lions among them, and behold, they slay them, because they know not the manner of the God of the land." The monarch, desirous of assisting his subjects, and in the firm belief that the " God of the land" was vindictively injuring them, found it necessary in his judg ment to propitiate the offended Deity by sending back to Samaria one of the expatriated Jewish priests. " Carry thither," he commanded, "one of the priests whom ye brought from thence .... and let him teach them the manner of tho God of tho land."2 Similarly, nearly three centuries later, we find that the Persian king, though firmly believing in Ahura-Mazda as the most powerful of the gods, yet credited the gods of the nations on his borders with not inconsiderable authority and influence. In the time of Artaxerxes Longimanus, for in stance (b.c. 465-425), we find the sovereign decreeing a number of important concessions to tho Jews, and giving the following reason for doing so: " Whatsoever is commanded 1 2 Kings xvii. C, 24. * 2 Kings xvii. 20, 27.</page><page sequence="7">370 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. by tho God of Heaven, let it be done exactly for the house of the God of Heaven; for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons ? "l He feared tho dis pleasure of Jehovah the God of the Jews. These two instances, separated by an interval of 280 years, afford an insight, as I have stated, into the religious feelings of the day. They show tho feelings of tho Assyrians in the eighth, and tho Persians in the fifth century B.C. towards the God of tho Jews. When tho Assyrians and Chaldocans settled in Samaria in the eighth century B.C., they carried thither their own worship: "The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, and the men of Cuth made Norgal, and the men of Hamath made Ashiina, and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children to Adrammelech and Anammelech,2 the gods of Sepharvaim." 3 It would bo mere waste of time to enlarge on the feelings of tho Jews towards tho gods of their neighbours. Their belief in tho power of those divinities was so great that, as the Scriptures tell us, the Jews per petually excited the wrath of Jehovah by their idolatries. One after another they fell away to tho adoration of Egyptian, Chaldocan, and Assyrian deities, in sun-worship even going the length of stabling the horses of the sun in the court of the temple at Jerusalem. It can scarcely bo doubted that the use of sun-symbols followed sun-worship. It does not appear unreasonable to assume that there may havo been a reciprocity of superstitious ideas between the Assyrian subjects of the empire and their eastern neighbours the Hindus, similar to that which existed between the same Assyrians and their western neighbours tho Jews. A century after the reign of Sargon, the Assyrian empire was finally destroyed, and Cyaxares tho Median established on its ruins the foundation of tho great empire that passed in tho year 558 B.C. from the Medes to Cyrus the Persian. Cyrus, amongst other conquests, reduced the whole country 1 Ezra vii. 23 (Revised version). 2 Sun-god and goddess. 3 2 Kings *vii. 30, 31.</page><page sequence="8">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 371 up to the Indus, including Afghanistan and Boliichistan, but he does not appear to have crossed the Indus bent on territorial aggrandizomont. It is during the reign of Cyrus that we first find mention made of India by any Greek writer. This is Ilekataius of Miletus (n.c. 549-486), who, by mentioning several places and cities in Northern India, proves that that country was known to Europeans. In b.c. 521 succeeded to the throno of Persia Darius Hystaspis, who, fired doubtless by tho knowledge acquired by his predecessors of the internal wealth and at the same time of the weakness of Trans-Indus countries, crossed the great river about tho year 515 B.C., and conquered and annexed to the Persian empire the rich country of the Panjab, and the Indus valley. Henceforward that portion of India lay under Persian domination till the breaking up of the Empire at the Macedonian invasion two centuries later. "The results of this conquest," writes Professor Rawlinson,1 "were the acquisition of a brave race capable of making excellent soldiers, an enormous increase of revenue, a sudden and vast influx of gold into Persia, which led probably to the introduction of gold coinage, and the establishment of commercial relations with the natives, which issued in a regular trade carried on by coasting vessels between the mouths of the Indus and tho Persian Gulf." I can hardly concur in the opinion that commercial relations were then " established," if that word be taken to mean first established. It would seem more likely that commerce was consolidated and greatly facilitated by the conquests of Darius, while a new and important lino of communication was opened up by water-way down the Indus to the Persian Gulf. An additional effect of the conquest and of Persian domination for two centuries would naturally be greatly to increase the spread of Persian ideas amongst the Hindus of that part of India, and still further to undermine the then declining religion of the Vedas. The conquered portion of India formed the 20th satrapy 1 Ancient Monarchies, vol. iii. p. 431. VOL. XVIII.?(NBW 8BHIB8.] 25</page><page sequence="9">372 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. mentioned by Herodotus, and paid the enormous tribute of 360 talents of gold-dust to the imperial exchequer.1 It was about this time that tho Buddha arose and founded his system of philosophy. The much-vexed question of Nirvana chronology will not here bo entered into; but if Buddha's death occurred after the year 515 B.C., he must have been perfectly aware of the great conquests of Darius Hystaspis, and the representatives of the reigning family of Magadha must have trembled for the safety of their kingdom.2 Xerxes, who succeeded Darius in 486 B.C., retained all his father's provinces, including those in India, and a body of troops raised in the Panjab served under his standard in his fruitless expedition against Greece. Herodotus describes tho dress of these soldiers, the first representatives of Im perialism as understood by the Persians.8 Their leader appears to have been a Persian or a Parthian?Pharna zathres, tho son of Artabates.4 They fought under Mar donius at Platroa.5 "India" is mentioned in the Jewish Chronicles as forming part of the 127 provinces of Xerxes (Ahasuerus) and his successors.6 Herodotus, who flourished in the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus (465-425 b.c), the successor of Xerxes, re peatedly mentions India, though his own knowledge seems to have stopped short at the Indus. Ktesias, physician to Artaxerxes Mnemon (b.c. 405-359), wrote an elaborate though untrustworthy account of India. A fow years later, b.c. 330, the Persian empire was completely destroyed by Alexander the Macedonian, and four years afterwards this monarch crossed the Indus, and largely extended the boundaries of the empire. His ago synchronizes with that of Chandragupta, the Mauryan, and marks an epoch in the early history of India. 1 Herod, iii. 94, 96. 2 Rawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. iii. p. 131. 9 Wc read of no Indian troops being utilized for European warfare from the days of Xerxes to those of Lord Beaconsficld. ?

When it is remembered that the original faith of the Turanian inhabitants of both countries was one aud tho same, and that this was the faith cherished by the masses of the people, it would be natural to assume that this state of things resulted in religious changes and mutual assimilations. It was owing to the expedition of Alexander that India was first really made known to European nations, for the conqueror took with him a number of learned and scientific men1 specially selected for the purpose of collecting and recording all available information relative to the reduced tracts and their inhabitants; and their works, condensed by Strabo, Arrian, and Pliny, prove how earnestly they strove honourably to fulfil their task. Alexander found in the Panjab and Indus valley a number of petty princes, jealous of one another and practical^ powerless to defend themselves, but recognizing the King of Persia as their suzerain and paying tribute to him. One only, Porus or Puru, attempted to check the invasion, but he was defeated without difficulty. The Greek armies then pressed on to Amritsur, their leader being determined to conquer the whole of the north of India as far as the valley of the Ganges ; but wearied by the heat, and exhausted by the troubles and difficulties of their protracted campaign, they wore compelled to abandon this project, and to journey south wards along the banks of the Jholum. Near the confluence of the five great rivers, Alexander made a long halt, built a city, which he called Alexandria, received there the sub mission of tho neighbouring states, and constituted it tho 1 These were Bacto, Dioguetos, Neaiehos, Onesikritos, Aristoboulos, Kalli sthcncs, and others.</page><page sequence="11">374 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. capital of tho satrapy. Journeying finally down the Indus, the Greek forces retired, partly by sea, partly by land through Beluchistan, and reached Susa B.C. 325. Corroborative proof of the existence in those days of considerable land trade in India is found in the mention by Herodotus of long lines of highways, marked with what we should call mile-stones, which were deemed so important by Alexander that he had them surveyed. Northern India was now, after eight centuries of proximity to the Assyrio-Chaldrcan empire, and after two centuries of partial Persian domination, subjected to the influences of the Greeks, which, though not felt during a long period of time, yet produced a serious impression on the arts of the country. It is now for the first time, so far as can be gathered, that the Hindus began to carve and construct buildings in stone. During the Greek period detachments of Greek soldiers must have guarded all important Greek points in the north, while in the Alexandrian cities of Bucephalia, near Jabalpur on the Jhelum, Nicnoa, on the east side of the same river, Alex andria, the modern Uchch in the southern Punjab, and Patala or Haidaritbad in Sinde,?there probably resided communities of Greek settlers.1 Meanwhile Chandragupta, an adventurer, was acquiring power in Magadha. Everything was in his favour. The Hindu princes were impoverished and enfeebled by internal disputes and Persian requisitions, while on the death of Alexander in B.C. 323, discord ensued in the ranks of the invaders. The Indian provinces fell to the share of Alex ander's General Seleukos Nikator, but his weakness was Chandragupta's strength, and when, after several troublous years, the former found time to pay serious attention to the condition of his Indian feudatories, he found himself face to face with an empire. Chandragupta had acquired such power that the Greek was paralyzed, and was forced to come to terms. An alliance ensued. Seleukos abandoned his Indian possessions, and received in return a present of 500 elephants 1 Article " India," Encyclop. Brit.</page><page sequence="12">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 375 from Chandragupta, a present which ho commemorated on his coins; * he gave his daughter in marriage to Chandragupta; and sent an ambassador, Megastbenes, to the court of Patala putra.2 This alliance altered the relative positions of tho Greeks in India and the natives in tho country. Previous to it, there seems to have been a succession of massacres of the new comers by the Hindus. After the alliance, friendly relations were established which must have largely con tributed to the spread of western influences, both Greek and Persian. This friendship lasted into the time of Asoka, the grandson of Chandragupta, who formed an alliance with Antiochus Theos, the grandson of Seleukos, in B.C. 256,? Antiochus Soter, who murdered and then succeeded Seleukos, having in the meantime sent an embassy under Daimachos to Chandragupta's son and successor Bimbisara. During the preceding two centuries Buddhism had been steadily gaining ground amongst the people, and Asoka made it th? state religion. Proof that more intimate relations existed at this period between the Hindus and the kingdoms of the west is found in the mention by Asoka, in his llth edict, of five Greek princes, Antiochus of Syria, Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt, Antigonus of Macedon, Magas of Cyrene, and Alexander of Epirus, while the king boasts that Buddhist ideas were spreading amongst western nations. Fifty years after the time of Asoka, Euthydemus, the Greeco-Baktrian, and his son Demetrius carried their arms into India (b.c. 191-181), and a city called Euthydemeia was founded on the Jhelum.3 Eukratides, who succeeded Deme trius, conquered the country as far as Alexander's royal city of Patala, and appears to have sent expeditions into Cutch and Gujarat (b.c. 181-151). General Cunningham4 has expressed the opinion that the Indian provinces remained subject to the Baktrian kings during the reigns of Lysias, 1 Poole's Catalogue of the Coins of the Seleucid flings, plate i.

Professor Weber thinks that the Gnoco-BaktrianB advanced as far as Oudh. "We have corroborative evidence in the Bible of Indian trade with tho west in those days, for it is stated there that in the time of the Maccabees, Antiochus Eupator of Syria had in his army 32 war-elephants carrying Indian mahouts.1 This was in B.C. 163. The Persian army too, at that time, or only a few years previous, possessed 120 elephants,8 To return to Northern India,?the next great political event succeeding tho Baktrian era was the invasion of tho country by the Yueh-chi, as they are called by Chinese authors, Tartar tribes from tho north-west. This took place in the first century B.C. The invaders are variously termed Scyths, Turanians, Sakas, Indo-Scythians. As to their in vasion and its effect, I quote from Professor Max Miiller'a u India, what can it teach t/s*"3 They swept over the country, overthrow the Mauryan kingdom, and "took pos session of India, or at least the government of India, from about the first century B.C. to the third century a.d." Tho invaders belonged, in a sense, to tho religion of tho people, the religion that was merged into Buddhism, in opposition to the Vedic religion. "The rise of Buddhism and its formal adoption by King Asoka had already considerably shaken the power and influence of the old Brahmanic hierarchy. Tho northern conquerors .... were certainly not believers in the Veda. They seem to have made a sort of compromise with Buddhism, and it is probably due to that compromise, or to an amalgamation of Saka legends with Buddhist doctrines, that we owe the so-called Mahayana form of Buddhism?and more particularly the Amitabha worship ? which was finally settled at the Council under Kanishka, one of the Turanian rulers in India in the first century a.d." The four centuries of Turanian domination 1 1 Mace. vi. 30-37. 2 id. viii. 6. 8 p. 85 if. und 274-277.</page><page sequence="14">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 377 caused a complete cessation of literary activity in India, though at the same time this period witnessed the con struction in stone of some of the most elaborate and beautiful architectural monuments in the country. About the year 20 B.C. we find an embassy sent from India to Augustus at Rome, the credentials of which were written on skins, showing how far western usage and Turanian freedom had overcome Brahmanical and Buddhist prejudices. Intercourse with Rome is still further proved by the quantity of Roman coins found in all parts of India.1 It is possible, even, that a colony of Romans occupied Madura, for it seems that the Pitndyan king sent an em bassy to Rome about this period, while a large number of Roman copper coins havo been found in the river-bed at that city in various scattered localities.2 I lay stress on tho coins being copper because, while a find of gold or silver coins would not prove much, the discovery of copper coins in scattered localities seems to point to an occupation of the place by persons who used them in daily life. The Peutingerian Tables, if they may be held as an authority, locate a temple of Augustus on tho coast near " Muziris," 3 and certainly nothing would seem more natural than that Roman traders engaged in the gold trade in the Wynaad should have erected a place of worship for themselves. The testimony of Arrian (a.d. 150) must not be overlooked. His knowledge of India, north and south, was far too ex tensive and accurate to havo been gained in any way but through informants thoroughly conversant with the country, and possibly resident therein. Mention must also be made of the Syrian colonies on the western coast, whose advent would seem to have occurred in the early years of our era. The indigenous chronicles of Cuttack on the north-eastern coast of the Peninsula, though their testimony must be 1 For Southern India see the author's List of Antiquities, Madras, vol. i. op. 144, 190, 214, 218, 220, 222, 220-240, 244, 285, 286, 291. 2 Mr. Scott, a pleader iu the District Court of Madura, has a quantity of these. 8 Desjardins, Segment xi.

For present purposes it is not necessary to carry this cursory view of Hindu foreign political relations lower than the Roman period, since this is the age of the latest and most elaborate Buddhist stone structures. Enough has been said to show that the Hindus of tho north lay open to constant foreign influence. I shall now attempt to show that these influences did actually take effect, as it is natural to suppose that they would have done, so that there can bo nothing far-fetched in the idea that tho symbolism of Buddhist days might have been, in part, of foreign and not indigenous origin. To this end it is necessary to consider for a moment the state of religious belief in Chakkca, Persia, and India, in order to ascertain whether it is reasonable to hold that the inhabitants of either of these countries might have adopted the religious ideas of their neighbours. When the Aryans migrated to India they found in that country a race of non-Aryans?a people of a lower type than their own, long resident in their land. The Vedic hymns characterize these last as "non-sacrificers,"2 "without gods," " without rites," but sufficiently civilized to possess " castles and forts." They seem to have been worshippers of trees and serpents?their principal deity was an earth-god. They practised all kinds of fetish-worship.8 Tho Aryans brought with them their Yedas, and their worship of the manifesta 1 ScwcH's lists of Antiquities. Madras, vol. ii. p. 205, and the same author's Sketch of the Dynasties of Southern India, p. 66. Hunter's Orissa, App. vii. 2 This, however, would seem to have been a mistake. The Turanians npprar to have immolated human victims in propitiation of tho bloody and vindictivo demons they feared. 3 Cave-ttmples of India (Fergusson and Burgess), p. 13.</page><page sequence="16">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 379 tions of a soul or spirit in nature?Indra, Varuna, Agni, Ushas, Vayu and the Maruts, Savitri, Surya, Vishnu and others. Once in India the Aryan religion became gradually corrupted. Ignorant superstition had its natural effect. Fear of evil and dread of the unknown supernatural, acquired by constant contact with people who feared and dreaded, gradually overcame enfeebled confidence and trust in bene ficent powers. It is, I think, probable that contact with the races that formed the powerful second Assyrian empire, in the two centuries preceding the age of Buddha, helped to bring about this state of things. This idea seems to have been held by Fergusson, who thought that the idea of Vishnu was imported from the West, and that the garuda is nothing more than the hawk-headed divinity of the Assyrians.1 Fergusson thus sums up the religious question as it stood in tho sixth century b.c. " Tho blood of the Aryans had become so mixed and so impure that the Veda was no longer possible as a rule of faith, and when Siikya-Muni availed himself of the opportunity so afforded.his call was responded to in a manner which led to the most important con sequences." He asserts, though with some hesitation, that as many as nine or ten of the Nandas, the immediate pre decessors of Chandragupta, were serpent-worshippers.2 The faith of the Chaldaeans may bo best summarized in the words of Professor Rawlinson:?" The worship was grossly polytheistic. Various deities .... divided the allegiance of the people, and even of tho kings, who regarded with equal respect .... some fifteen or sixteen personages. Next to these principal gods were a far more numerous assemblage of inferior or secondary divinities .... recognized generally throughout the country. Finally the Pantheon contained a host of mere local gods or genii, every town, and almost every village in Babylonia being under the protection of its own particular divinity."3 But this description might actually have been written for Turanian India, if we may 1 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 76. 8 Tiee and Serpent Worship, pp. 67-69. 3 Ilawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. i. p. 110.</page><page sequence="17">380 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. judge of what Turanian beliefs were by considering what they are to this day, notably in the most Turanian tracts in Southern India. It is important for present purposes that this should not be lost sight of. The beliefs of the Chaldrcans were almost identical with those of the masses in India. In Chaldsca, however, " the religion was to a certain extent astral. Tho heaven itself, the sun, moon, and tho five planets havo each their representative in the Chaldaoan Pantheon among the chief objects of worship. At tho same time it is to be observed that the astral element is not universal, but partial."1 The religion of the Assyrians closely resembled that of the Chaldmans.2 Tho early Persians, like the early Indians, were sorpent worshippers, and followed Turanian beliefs. As in India, so in Persia, a higher form of religion spread itself over tho land. This last was, indeed, one and the same. I may be pardoned for again quoting Fergusson in this respect:?"At the time when the Greeks became acquainted with Persia, the wholo country, under the influence of the Achcemenian kings, had been brought to acknowledge Zoroastrianism with its elemental fire-worship as their principal form of faith. This religion in its purity.was the faith which the Iranians brought with them from their original seats when they separated from the Indian Aryans, and was practically their common faith both in India and in Persia. In the latter country, however, it was strangely mixed up with Magism, a religion of much more Semitic, or even, it may be suspected, Turanian form, and the two were at that time so blended in the Grecian accounts at least that it is now impossible to separate the one from the other."3 Thus, in Persia and in India there was a close similarity of religious belief,?Turanianism overlaid with the purer worship of divine manifestations of Power in Nature. The hostility of the priesthood practically proves the connection, for the great Persian Divinity Ahura-MvLzAa was an Asura, 1 id. p. 111. 2 Ancient Monarchies, vol. ii. p. i. 3 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 42.</page><page sequence="18">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 381 or malignant spirit to the Hindu, while the Hindu Deva became a demon or devil to the Persian.1 The difference consisted in the development rather than in the germ. The Persians purified their religion into something akin to monotheism, the Hindus sank lower and lower into tbe depths of Turanian poly-daomonism. But in their origin their religious beliefs were identical, and there is no reason for rejecting as absurd and fanciful a theory that their early symbolism may have been the same. Sun-symbols especially might have survived to a late date in both countries. The above summary, however, only goes to prove possi bilities. It is necessary, now, to come to more certain and clear proofs that the Hindus of Northern India did actually succumb, and that in no small degree, to foreign influences, in pre-Buddhist duys. Professor Max Miiller has noted an abrupt change in Hindu literature between the time of the Vedas and that of the Brahmanas (i.e. previous to 600 B.C.). This occurred during the period of the powerful later Assyrian empire, when the frontiers of India aud of that empire touched one another along the whole of the north-west and west, from Kabul to Karrachi, and when Assyrian and Chaldooan influences were likely to make themselves most felt. The change is stated by the learned Professor in his History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, to have been so important that it led to " a complete misunderstanding of the original in tentions of the Vedic hymns." The old Aryan religion was revolutionized. The result is thus epitomized by a recent writer in this Journal,2 " New gods were invented iu profu sion, and some of these new mythological personages over shadowed and supplanted the deities of the Vedic age. Monstrous cosmogonies were invented and .... an entirely new mode of describing the world is adopted .... Into this new system of the world, the sun, moon, and stars, together with the zodiac and the twenty-seven lunar mansions, made 1 "Ancient Monarchies,'1'' vol. ii. p. 324.

It has also been pointed out that about a century or more after the probable era of the Brilhraanas, &amp;ukyamuni found the Hindus believing in the doctrine of metempsychosis, which is by origin an Egyptian, not a Vedic doctrine. Now if all this is not an exaggeration, and there is little reason to suppose that that is the case, it seems to afford direct evidence that India was at that time subjected to some extent to Chaldcoan influences. MM, Perrot and Chipiez, in their admirable work on the History of Art in Chaldcea and Assyria,1 have given a clear account of the Chaldican system of astrology and numorical calculation, with a description of its origin, which, though it stands unproved, at least seems most reasonable and admissible when viewed theoretically. In early days, say they, in Chaldaca, as in the early days of many families of the human race, fetich ism, belief in demons, and spirits both malevolent and beneficent, reigned supreme, and worship or propitiation was associated with incantations and magic. As time passed on tho priests added astrology to magic in their search after charms sufficiently powerful to compel to obedience those brilliant genii who inhabited the bright heavens and showed themselves to man at night.2 But though simple minds might believe in the power of these charms, the priests, with more keen intellectual observation, noticed that neither sun, moon, nor stars ever changed their position in obedience to the command of man. Planetary motion, however, made itself visible, and the regularity of the motion of the sun and moon was also noted ; and as all was favourable for study, tho air clear, the nights balmy, men set themselves to work out the meaning of the motion of the heavenly bodies. Observatories, raised high above the mists, were built, and lofty platforms erected for the purpose. Students of Astronomy began to believe that the lives of individuals were affected from the time they were born by 1 Op. cit. vol. i. p. 65-73 (Armstrong's translation). 2 " Cnrmina vet cosh possunl deduce re luuam,*' So Virgil many centuries later (Bucol. viii. 69).</page><page sequence="20">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 383 the condition of the planets at the moment of birth. Hence arose the whole system of astrology, which has had such an effect on the minds of men that it lasted in full force, even in Europe, down to the sixteenth century of our era, and to tho present day claims hero some few votaries, while in India it still reigns supreme.1 Astrology paved the way for Astronomy. In order to profit by tho indications of the stars, in order, that is, to foretell success or disaster, it became necessary to foresee the positions the planets would occupy in the sky on a given day or hour?necessary to arrive by repeated observation at an exact knowledge of the route followed by the planets across the sky, and to distinguish them one from another by name. The result was a close, accurate, and patient study, which has been of incalculable benefit to mankind. 1 Tho Chaldomn system of Astrology spread far and wide. The "Magi11 iu Persia seem to have been second only to the irresponsible monarch in power. One, indeed, Pseudo-Smcrdis, or "Gomatcs, the Magi an," a priest, seized tho monarchy and held it firmly for a short time. Originally a Median religious caste, they appear to have adopted and carried on the sciences of the Chnldsuau star-gazers, after the fall of Babylon and establishment of the Empire of the Medes; for when the Greeks and Romans come in contact with them, they seem to have been called inditfereutly "Magi"or 'Chaldieans." A good ilka of Chaldamn magic, as intimately known to the Jews, who were largely affected by it, is gained from the prophecy of Isaiah (xlvii. 12.), who, apostrophizing the city of Baoylon under the titlo " daughter of tho Chnldajans/ says,?" Stand now with thy enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries.Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels: let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, the monthly proenosticators, stand up and save thee from the things that shall conio upon thee.'* Though all forms of magic were forbidden by the Avesta, and Zoroastrianism was opposed to Magianism. the Magi contrived to pose before the Greeks as the representatives of tho religion of Persia. iEschylus mentions them as a tribe. Sophocles writes of them with coutempt. Plato held them in honour, and so did Xenophou. All over tbe civilized world tho arts of astrology and divination, as taught by the Magi, came to bo practised. The priests thus acquired a recognized position in society, their services being required on all occasions, alike l&gt;y tlie king and the peasant. Under the Roman Empire flourished swarms of impostors, professors in the Art of Magic, who wnro known ns " Mngi," " Chaldtei,M " Mathemutici.'* When Itoman chiefs built their villa-residences in tho newly-conquered islaud of Britain, they brought with them the symbols aud superstitions of their own country. The old svastika emblem was introduced by them into the decorated mosaic flooring of their principal rooms. Specimens are found in the Roman villa ut Wliitcstuunton iu Somersetshire, as well as iu that at tirading in the Isle of Wight; and in curious connection with it in the latter mosaic is tho figure of an astrologer with a divining-rod in his hand, who has, in the field of the design, as if in the air, close by his head?in tho place where, under the Assyrians aud Persians, nu anthropomorphic winged-globe would have been depicted,?an Oriental sun-emblem, tho circle or wheel on a pillar, exactly as seen at Amaravati and Sanchi. It seems most probable that this design stamps the astrologer as a representative of eastern magic.</page><page sequence="21">384 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. The ChahkQans, for purposes of calculation, established an intricate system of numeration. They began by counting on their fingers by units of five. Then they adopted a notation by sixes and twelves as an improvement on the former, since the figure ton could be divided neither into three nor four equal parts.1 Numeration by sixes led to their division of time into the sos of 60 years, the tier of 600 years, and the sar of 3600 years. Lenormant points out that 60 may be divided by any divisor of ten or twelve. " Of all numbers that could be chosen as an invariable denominator for fractions it has most divisors." 2 Founded on a sexagesimal numeration, tho metrical system of Babylon and Nineveh was the most scientific of all those practised by the ancients. The Chaldceans began by registering the phenomena. They noted seven planets, including the sun and moon, and observed the apparent march of tho sun through tho constella tions that aro still called the " Signs of the Zodiac," and it seems that they oven went so far as to recognize the annual displacement of the equinoctial point upon the ecliptic, but their instruments wero too defective to enublo them to go very far. They used for astronomical calculations the solar year of 365J days, with which they made themselves ac quainted, though for convenience they used the lunar year in civil life. The Greek astronomer, Epigones, declares that the Chaldflcans had preserved their calculations for an in credible number of years, and it is certain that many tablets containing stellar and planetary observations have been discovered. They believed in seven celestial deities, those of the Sun, Moon, and five great planets?Adar (Saturn), Merodach (Jupiter), Nergal (Mars), Istar (Venus), and Nebo (Mercury). The modern European system of time-calculation is derived, almost certainly, from Chaldoea. Hence our sexagesimal divisions. We have sixty minutes to an hour, sixty seconds 1 Aurcs, Essai sur le Sysieme tne'trique Assyricn, p. 10 (in the Rccucil de Traraux rclatifs d la Philologie et d I Archiologie Egyptiennes et Assyriennes, vol. iii.). 2 F. Lenormant, Manual d'Ristoire Ancienne, vol. ii. p. 177 (3rd edition).</page><page sequence="22">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 385 to a minute, sixty divisions to a degree of space. Similarly the Hindus, deriving their method equally from Chaldaoa, divide time into cycles of sixty years, and their days into sixty ghatis of twenty-four minutes each. A similar sexa gesimal division of years is in use both in China and Japan, probably carried thither on the introduction of Buddhism from India, for there are separate and distinct indigenous systems in use in both countries. With regard to the days of the week, the Indians, equally with European nations, divide the days into groups of seven, named in the same order in all countries, after the sun, moon, and five great planets of the Chaldteans. General Cunningham contributed to the Indian Antiquary last year an interesting paper on this subject.1 He writes: There is " good evidence to show that the week days, as named after the seven planets, were in use, both in Persia and in India, at the same time as in the West, and perhaps even earlier. We havo the testimony of Celsus, who lived during the reign of Augustus and Tiberius, that the Persian temples had seven gates, named after the sun and planets in regular order, from Saturn to the Sun." Proof that this system was early in vogue in India is afforded by a passage in the life of Apollonius by Philostratus. He says: " The Indian sage Iarchas gave Apollonius seven rings, each bearing the name of one of the seven stars, and he wore them alternately, according to the particular name of the day."2 " As Philostratus derived his information from the Assyrian Damis, who actually accompanied Apollonius, this notice is contemporary with the date of his travels, between a.d. 20 and 50. The use of the week days named after the seven stars was, there fore, already established in India at least as early as the beginning of the Christian era." General Cunningham shows by diagrams how the calculation by Indian ghath of twenty-four minutes each results in the same order of tho days of the week as the European division. He concludes by saying that though there is no direct evidence to show 1 Indian Antiquary, xiv. 1 (Jan. 1885). 2 Philost. VU Apolloniii iii. 41. Priaulx's Apollonius of Tyana, p. 03 (see "Postscript" below, p. 405).</page><page sequence="23">386 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. tho ago of tho scheme, it appears to have been in use in Media and Babylonia for several centuries before the Christian era. Aud with this conclusion probably few will be found to disagree. In treating of the origin of the triiula, which he connects with the Ohaldsoan ouneiform form sign for Taurus fc|$, the late Edward Thomas saw nothing fanciful in the supposition that tho early Hindus possibly borrowed the triiula symbol from thoir western neighbours, lie wrote: " The dawning science of Astronomy, in its concurrent deceptive phase of Astrology, must readily have identified itself with kindred magic in the interchange of signs and symbols, as in other mutual aids." l We find therefore that the Chaldaoans succeeded in introducing into India their astronomical and hence their astrological system, their divisions of time and their nomen clature of the days of the week, all of which are in daily use at the present day. The system of astrology has fast hold of tho people of India at the present day, as is well known. From highest to lowest, no man who can afford to pay for it ever dreams of entering on any new or important under taking without obtaining the opinion of the astrologer of the village or family as to when a lucky moment will occur. Most of the villages of Southern India have, to this day, a paid astrologer for domestic use. Other and very important evidence of foreign influence in India in early days is afforded by the alphabet in use in the days of Asoka (250 B.C.). No other alphabet has been intro duced since that day. All tho alphabets at present in use are modifications of that original. Dr. Burnell believed2 that the alphabet of Asoka had been derived originally from Western Asia beforo the time of Alexander, and whether this view is correct or not, it was at least the view of a shrewd and critical scholar. He writes: " I have already mentioned the numerous indications that point to a Semitic origin of the Indian alphabets, and which are generally received * J.R.A.S. (New Series), Vol. I. p. 484. * South Indian Paleography% pp. 1-9.</page><page sequence="24">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 337 as sufficient; the immediate original is, however, yet un certain. Three probable sources may be suggested. The first is that the Indian alphabet came directly from Phoenicia, and was introduced by the early Phoenician traders. The second is that the original of these alphabets is to be sought in the modified Phoenician alphabets used by the Hirayarites of Arabia, and this has lately been put forward as an ascer tained fact.1 As a third possibility I would suggest that the Indian alphabets may be derived from an Aramaic character used in Persia or rather Babylonia." He concludes his discussion of the subject by admitting that the infor mation at present available is too scanty to justify a more precise inference, but that he inclines to look on the Aramaic character as the original. Professor Max Muller also believes that the Asoka alphabet was derived from the West. The Hindus them selves admitted that it was of foreign origin. Panini, whose date is variously assigned to the fourth, third, and second century b.c, calls it the " Yavandni lipi," though the term " Yavana " may apply to any nation of so-called barbarians outside India. It must not be forgotten that the alphabet was probably introduced long before Asoka's day; for though there is no known inscription extant earlier than 250 B.C., it is clear that the character must at that time have undergone serious modifications in India since its introduction, for no alphabet exactly corresponding to it has yet been discovered in Asia, though many exist of a date considerably earlier than the great Buddhist monarch. To turn now for a few moments to the architecture and sculpture of India in the earliest period known to us?a subject which is perhaps more important than all for my present purpose. It will be remembered that no known building or rock-cut cave exists in India of a date older than the third century b.c. Is the architecture of indigenous growth P or does it show signs of Western influence ? The 1 Ity Lenormant, Essai sur la Propagation de VAlphabet Phenicien, i. part i. table vi. VOL. XVIII.?[NEW BEUIE8.] 26</page><page sequence="25">388 EARLY BUDDniST SYMBOLISM. answer seems easy to give. Tho general shape of tho struc tures would appear to be of Indian origin, derived from previously existing buildings, probably made in wood, and adapted to Hindu requirements; but in the ornamentation of these structures, in the decoration of the surface, and in the shape of such pillars as were erected by the Buddhists, they seem to have had recourse to Persian models. The style has been termed Indo-Persian, its fons et origo being at Persepolis.' This is so well known in the present day that it may seem superfluous, in a Society like this, to enlarge on the subject. It might be taken as an accepted fact. But it is, perhaps, well to note shortly the opinion of such a judge as Fergusson. Ho states that all the hits or detached pillars of tho time of Asoka "are similar to one another. Circular stone shafts, .... surmounted by a capital with the falling-leaf, or bell-shaped form found at Persepolis. This form of the capital, together with the Grecian or rather Assyrian honey suckle ornament with which it is generally associated, are two of tho most valuable ethnographical indications which the architecture of this day affords." 1 The presence of winged lions and other animals on the base and abacus of the pillar is another point of resemblance, tho Hindu mythology containing no allusion to four-footed beasts with wings?and their position on the pillar being almost conclusive as to their origin. An excellent paper on the subject appeared in the periodical called the Friend of India, on the 13th November, 1875. The writer described in detail the close connection observable between early Indian and Western sculpture both Persian and Greek. And it is remarkable that for several centuries, down to the most flourishing period of Buddhist Art, the period of tho Amaru vat I Tope, the last and most exquisite of its class whose construction may in part belong to a period five centuries later than that of Asoka, during the whole of which it would seem that the Arts had flourished amongst 1 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 94.</page><page sequence="26">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 389 tho Buddhists, the same typo of pillar-capital, base and shaft is found, and the same general form of construction. During ail those years no indigenous art had arisen to oust the old foreign designs. Tho pillars and pilasters of the AraaravatI Tope are in form substantiall}r the pillars and pilasters of Bharhut and Sanchl. It is now timo to turn to the special subject of the present paper, the symbols in use amongst the early Buddhists as exhibited in the sculptures of tho existent Topes. It has been shown that the Hindus lay open to Western influences for many centuries, and I have endeavoured to show that they succumbed in large measure to those influences?their astronomical and astrological systems, their divisions of time, and nomenclature of days of the week, their alphabet, and their architectural style, being all more or less derived from the Chaldasans, Assyrians, Persians, and Greeks,? while it is significant that the old religion of the country was revolutionized exactly at the period of the greatest supremacy of tho later Assyrian Empire. The principal Buddhist symbols then,?are they of indigenous origin ? or were they derived from Western Asiatic sources ? Pure Buddhism was opposed to the uso of images or symbols. There was little in the doctrine of Buddha that appealed to the senses, and nothing remained for Buddhist artists when they began to carve in stone but to fall back for art purposes on the old mythology, and the popular super stitions, the fairy and snake-stories of tho people,1 and the old-world symbols long in use. It is another point of resemblance between the Hindus and their neighbours the Persians, that the former appear to have acted, with regard to the use of symbols, exactly as did the latter. Tho spirit of the Avesta was wholly opposed to idolatry, yet the Persians " did not deny themselves a certain use of symbolic repre sentation of their deities, nor did they scruple to adopt from idolatrous nations the forms of their religious symbolism." 2 1 Prof. Max Miiller, Introduction to the Parables of Buddhaghosha, by Capt. Bogors, p. xxvi. 3 llawlinson's Ancient Monarchies, vol. iii. p. 351.</page><page sequence="27">390 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. Thus the Assyrian winged globe, which in its turn had been borrowed from Egypt as a symbol of Semitic Asshur, was adopted by the Persians as a symbol of Aryan Ahura-Mazda; and thus, I believe, the svastika, the dharmachakra (so-called), aud tho triiula were borrowed by Hindu Buddhists from pre-existent forms, possibly in use in India in pre-Buddhist days, but ultimately derived from Assyria, Chaldooa, and Persia. And when it is remembered that all throe of these symbols were probably sun-symbols, tho theory is rendered still less improbable, for of all emblems which would be most likely to survive amidst tho fall of old creeds and the upheaval of atheistic philosophies, that relating to the ancient worship of the sun would naturally be tho most prominent, offending, as it did, against no prejudices, super stitions, or beliefs. The Jews, for instance, at one period, as I have stated above, saw no wrong in introducing ali tho paraphernalia of the old sun-worship into the very courts of the house of Jehovah at Jerusalem?and there is no reason to suppose that thoy had then revolted against their sacred creeds. They merely added adoration of the sun "and all the host of heaven"1 to the worship of their own Divinity. Similarly, at a time when Buddhists began to use symbols, old-world sun-symbols were those which lent themselves most readily and with least perversion of ideas to tho require ments of the new faith,?as it was then accepted by the masses of the Turanian-blooded people, being of necessity mixed-up with a great deal of the superstitions of former days. The emblems most frequently met with on Buddhist Topes may be divided into two classes?symbols of which the origin is distinctly Buddhist, and symbols of which the shape cannot be traced to a Buddhist origin. In the first 1 Under some of the kings of Judah the horses and chariots of the sun (2 Kings xxiii. 11) were stalled in the prcciucts of the Temple of Jerusalem. This dedi cation oi horses to tho sun was perhaps borrowed from tho Persians (Herod, i. 189; Curt. iii. 3. {11; Xin. Cyr*p. viii. 3. ? 24). Tho Armenians and tho Mafsagctrc sacrificed horses to tho sun {Herod, i. 210 ; Xtn. Atiab. iv. 6. } 35). It is noticeable that the horse is frequently introduced into the AnuuuvutI sculp tures in a way not yet satisfactorily explained. Suu-inuigcs are frequently alluded to in the chronicles of Israel aud Judah (levit. xxvi. 30, etc.).</page><page sequence="28">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 391 class must be placed (1) the d&amp;goba; (2) the empty throne of Buddha, probably signifying a spot whore Sakya-muni had resided or taught; (3) the feet-impressions, evidently pointing to some locality considered sacred because the feet of the sage had trodden its dust. In the latter class come first, (4) the tree, and (5) the serpent, emblems founded on the popular traditions of the people, and probably Turanian in origin, though tho tree may have been adopted by the Buddhists as a symbol of the sangha, the church, and very aptly so; and, secondly, three emblems, all as I believe of sun-origin; (6) the svastika, an Asiatic not merely Indian symbol; (7) the chakra, a wheel or fiory circle, generally represented as raised on a pillar; (8) the triiula, sometimes placed on a pillar like the chakra, and sometimes used, as at Amaravati, merely as an ornament,?for instance, when oft-repeated, it forms the crowning cornice of the inner rail.1 I am mainly concerned with the svastika, chakra, and triiula. The svastika and sanvastika are so well known that I need not dwell long on them. They appear to have been symbols of Western-Asian origin, whether Semitic or Aryan matters little, and to have boon adopted as emblematic of sun-motion. The point has been much disputed, but the sun-theory seems to be the one now most generally accepted. The symbol is found profusely amongst the ruins of the third, or burnt, city at Hissarlik, but not amongst those of the two earlier cities. Its use spread, possibly with Aryan emigrations, possibly with Magian astrology, westwards as far even as Britain ;2 and, travelling eastwards, it was, if not introduced by the Aryans, at any rate adopted at an early date by the Hindus, and 1 Other figures carved on tho Topo sculptures have been noticed as bearing a close rcseinhlauco to iigurcs carved on monuments further West. Thus Fergusson called attention (Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 187, and note 3) to an ornament or design used on the roll-frieze of the outer rail at AmaruvatI? ' an ornament new .... in so far as India is concerned,"?but which is found on the mystic representations of the Ephcsiau Artemis. It resembles the upper half of a little demon with upraised arms. A representation will bo found in Falkcuer's Ephesus, p. 286. Amongst other points of resemblance between Hindu and Western-Asian symbolism may be noted the fact that in both countries sculptured deities are often represented as holding in one hand a slain deer. 3 See above, note 1, p. 383.</page><page sequence="29">392 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. was made use of in their sculptures and inscriptions. Its general acceptation seems to have been as a token of good luck and prosperity, while romantic Buddhist teachers feigned that the feet of the Buddha himself were marked with these stigmata, proving that they accepted the sign as one of an older date than the birth of Buddha.1 Panini mentions the svastika as a sign branded for luck on the ears of cows.2 The symbol called tho chakra seems to be certainly an emblem of the sun. Its similarity, when raised on a pillar, to Assyrian types, has been repeatedly noticed, and it is useless for me to waste time by further discussion on tho matter. As a symbol of tho all-vivifying sun it was a most appropriate emblem of the Buddhist Dharma.* There remains the doubtful Triiula. What was its origin P Was it indigenous or exotic ? The figures given below aro taken from Fergusson's Tree and Serpent Worship, and from Fergusson and Burgess's Figure 2. 1 Tree and Serpent Worship, plate Ixxxvii. p. 229. 2 Prof. Max Muller, iu Schlicmann's Won (pp. 346-7); Goldstuckcr, Pfinini% his place in Sanskrit Litirature, p. 60. 3 The chakra occupies the most prominent place on tho summit of tho north gateway of the Suuchi Tope, llauked by two tns'uls.</page><page sequence="30">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 393 Cave Temples. The first (figure 1) is tho entire emblem, the second (figure 2) the mutilated form often seen. It is in the latter form that the emblem commonly appears on coins. It was an emblem not confined to architectural decoration. It is everywhere seen on the standards and arms of the soldiers, and on most Buddhist coins. It was one of the most favourite emblems of tho age.1 Representations of it, elevated to a most prominent position on a flaming pillar, are to be found at Amaravati.3 Is it possible that, like the chakra and the svastika, it was an old-world sun-emblem? My belief is?I say it with diffidence, because I am fully aware that the idea will sound at first preposterous to many minds, and I admit myself fully open to conviction should a better origin be eventually suggested?my belief is that this much-discussed triiula is nothing more nor less than a con ventionalized scarab?a sun-emblem derived from the Assyrians and Persians, and thence remotely from Egypt. It may not be inappropriate to show how other symbols have spread from nation to nation, and beeu adopted by creed after creed, in order to afford some basis for the supposition that this theory need not be scouted as wildly improbable, more especially since I have already pointed out the apparently strong influence exercised by tho Assyrians and Chaldooans on the early inhabitants of India. I will take, for example, first the old Egyptian tau, or the crux amata. Whatever this emblem originally signified, its rise began in Egypt. It was thence adopted by the Assyrians, aud is found on sculptures at Khorsabiid, on ivories from Nirardd, and on Ninevite cylinders. It is observed on numerous coins of the Mediterranean coasts at a late period, especially on coins of Cyprus. Ezckiel the prophet was so impressed by the idea that tbe symbol was one of good luck, that, in his vision, he conceived the tau as marked on the foreheads of all those persons who were destined to be saved.3 1 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 116. 2 id. plates lxx.

A peculiar anthropomorphic form of the tau, found at the demolition of the scrapeum at Memphis, appears to have given rise to the earlier semi-anthropomorphic form of the Ephesian Artemis, whence it spread into Greece. As a sign of security the tau was adopted by the Christian order of St. Anthony of Ethiopia, ono of the earliest religious orders ever founded by Christians, dating about 370 a.d. It is found on Hebrew and Gnostic charms, and Joseph von Hammer points to it as the all-potent sign of the Knights Templars.1 Similarly the winged globe of Egypt seems to have been accepted as a symbol of divine power and influence by tho Chaldocans and Assyrians, as well as by other neighbouring races. Just as it was sculptured over the doorways of Egyptian pylons, so it finds similar place amongst tho sculptured remains of those born imitators, the Phoenicians. In an anthropoid form it is universal in Assyria and Cluiktea where it represents the sun-god Asshur, and after wards in Persia where it stood for Ahura-Mazda, over shadowing and protecting the sovereigns in all their successful undertakings, whether in war or the chase. It is found as a guardian of doorways even in Mexico and Central America, though how it got there is at present a mystery.2 Whether the 1 Sec notes in tho Antiquary of March nnd August, 1881. 1 Seo Catherwood's Incidents of Travel in Ventral America, Chiapas, and Yucatan (1854), p. 385, for nu example at Ocosingo iu Chiapas.

It appears to be similar to the half-triiula seen so often at AmaravatI,1 which half-triiula?the triiula, that is, minus the lower member and with reduced wings?is the form in which the symbol is depicted on most of the Budd hist coins {figure 72), just as it is on these coins of Cyprus, Figure 7. where it seems almost certain that its origin is Western Asiatic or Egyptian. The fact that in both countries the symbol is used iu a mutilated form, apparently for the sake of simplicity, may be used as a strong argument in favour of a common origin, for it is surely not usual thus to cut a symbol in half. In India the form is most undoubtedly a half-/ra?/tf, and in the Cyprian examples, though its origin is not so clear, its position on the coin suffices to identify it. This mutilated form is constantly observed on Phoenician inscriptions,3 where it is elevated on a pedestal or standard a b c d Figure 8. 1 Above, Figuro 2, p. 392. 2 The coin is from Fergusson's Tree and Serpent Worship (p. 162, No. 1), a coin of Kranuuda.

Figure 9. To show how curiously symbols may be varied by ignorant sculptors, I may point to an instance of the winged globe found near the Limon Mine in New Segovia in America (figure 10), and figured in Pirn and Seemann's Dottings on the Roadside in Panama, Nicaragua, and Mosquito (18G9), p. 128. Ali the elements of the pennato globe are here in its Assyrianized form?the central circular body, in this instance somewhat heart-shaped, the sidewings, the lower fan-shaped tail, and tho two dangling ends under the wings. But whereas in Assyria the central body is converted into a wheel (the disk of the sun?whence probably the origin of the idea of the Buddhist chakra), and the body of an anthropoid deity, lho fan-like tails being the skirts of his robes and the dangling ends being the ends of his sash, here in America the sculptor has ignorantly dealt with the symbol just in the way that a child would. He has converted the central body into a face with roughly-cut nose, Figure 10. mouth, and ejres, and feeling him self bound in some way to account for the two ends that so often formed part of the original emblem, he has made them into two long moustaches depending from the upper lip of the rude face carved on the slab. The above remarks will serve to show how the sacred emblems of Egypt have spread into other countries and</page><page sequence="35">398 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. become altered and conventionalized in the process. Now, without going necessarily so far awny as Egypt, it is clear that the scarab was an emblem and a very important emblem to the Assyrians and peoples with whom the Hindus came in con tact, and it is often found in a highly conventionalized form. Figure 11. The original Egyptian type, as used in the hieroglyphs, is given in figure 11, taken from a sarcophagus in the British Museum, and some of its more highly conventional forms in figures 12, 13, both from the work of MM. Perrot and Chipiez.1 Figure 12 is taken from a scarab de picted on a patera, and Figure 13 from a cup as given by Figure 12. ;,^N.;,,.lC\^t4j,!U^' ' J^mh? 13. Layard. In both instances it is represented as elevated on a column or standard. The scarab was also largely used by the Chaldooans, and they adopted its form for their gems and seals, just as did the Egyptians. Numbers of engraved scarabs are found in Babylonia.2 That the emblem was in general use amongst the nations of Western Asia is shown by the numbers of scarabnoi that have been found, not only in Assyria and Chaldrca, but in early Greek tombs all round the Mediter ranean, in Cyprus, and in a hundred different places. One source whence they were derived has lately come to light, 1 History of Art in Phoenicia and Cyprus (Armstrong's translation), ii. 330, 331. 2 id. i. 77.</page><page sequence="36">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 399 Mr. Petrie having found at Naukratis several scarab-factories intended for export to the Mediterranean, the isles of Greece, the Phoenician colonies, and Etruria, The scarab was adopted by the Phoenicians at the same time as the cylinder (Assyria), and the cone (Asia Minor) as a pattern for their engraved gems, but the cylinder and cone gave way before the superior charms of the scarab and scaraboid, and the latter forms largely predominated in later years. A large number of scarabs have been found in Sardinia at Tharros. They bear engravings of degenerate Egyptian type, and mostly belong to the period between the end of the sixth and the end of the third century u.c, when Carthage was supreme in the Western Mediterranean, and the Punic cities in Sardinia enjoyed their greatest prosperity.1 A very important link between the Egyptian or Assyrian scarab and the Indian trisula will be found figured in Lajard's Culte de Mithra, plate x. figure 3. It is a scarab Figure 14. in a highly-conventionalized form {figure 14), engraved on a gem, having in the field the sun and moon, and at the side a Pahlavi legend, showing it to be probably of Sassanian origin. That the figure is intended to re present a scarab is clear from tho fortunate representation on it of the ball of dung rolled up by the natural scarabaeus, which ball of dung is often found on other figures of the scarab much more closely resembling nature. If to the central member of this figure a pair of wings be added, there will be found at once the entire and unmistakeable Buddhist trisula (figure 1), complete in all its parts. Comparison of the two designs can hardly fail to persuade any one that, if not intentional, tho resemblance is certainly extraordinary. The details of course vary, but the form is identical. The trisula is found repeated over and over again at Amaravati, at Buddha Gaya,2 at Sanehi, and indeed on all 1 Edinburgh JRevkw, Jan. 1886, p. 209. 2 Tree and Serpent Worship, p. 110, where it is figured.</page><page sequence="37">400 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. Buddhist Topes. That it was in use before the Sanchi Topo was erected is shown by the coin, given on figure 7 above, of Krananda, brother of Amogha, whom Thomas believed to be one of the nine Nandas, the predecessors of Chandragupta. Fergusson differs from this, asserting that the coin is more modern, but he declares it to bo certainly older than the first of the Sanchi gateways, and his view is probably correct. The coin is figured in Tree and Serpent Worship (p. 162, note 1). It contains several of the common Budd hist emblems, including the triiula in its truncated shape, as in figure 2. Fergusson, as I have already remarked, noticed the simi larity between the triiula symbol, the caducous of the god Mercury, and the sign of the planet Mercury.1 General Cunningham has made the same observation.3 Describing a coin of Pharaspos or Pharnaspcs of the Alexandrian poriod, he mentions that it bears on it " a caducous without a handle, which is (he zodiacal sign for Taurus." The symbol is, I contend, similar to the Buddhist truncated triiula (fig. 2), and similar to tho Cypriot emblem alluded to above (fig. 6). That it is a coin of Persian origin is proved not only by the fact of its bearing a legend in Pahlavi characters, but because the Assyrian man-headed winged bull on the obverse wears on his head a Persian tiara. My impression is that the triiula and the caducous spring from precisely the same original?the scarab. Tho form of the Buddhist triiula as represented (figure 1) at Amariivatl, for instance, is explainable thus. The body of the scarab is roughly drawn as a circle and often, as such, decorated with the circular lotus-disks of the outer rail with tho conventional water-leaf ornament; the upraised fore-legs and the head become conventionalized into rounded raised aims with a prominent central member; the wings are depicted as leaf-like projections on each side of the body; the hind-legs are rendered in form similar to tho 1 id. p. 110, note. * J.A.S. Bengal, L., part i. p. 171 (1881).</page><page sequence="38">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 401 fore-legs, but, as is essential to the general idea, not so much decorated. The hind-legs, as I cannot avoid calling them, of the triiula, are specially noticeable, as the Amaru vati examples give them a strangely animal look, especially about what would be the knee-joint. Moreover, it must be noted that the scarab proper (figure 11) is always depicted with certain necessary claw-like projections on the fore-legs, and none, or very slight ones, on the hinder legs. An exactly similar difference is observable in the Indian trisula, the extremities of the upper members being ornamented, often in trefoil-shape, while the lower extremities are left less Figure 15. marked. It was, perhaps, this absence of ornamentation about the lower members that led to their being discarded in the in termediate form given in Figure 15?where the upper and middle members are strongly accentu ated while the lower limbs have dwindled into mere extraneous adjuncts. This form is taken from the summit of the north gateway at Saficbl.1 Tho form of the caducous may be explained thus. The body of the scarab is drawn as before in a circle, the fore and hind-legs are placed in the usual position, the extremities of the fore-legs having a certain development wanting in the hind-legs, in accordance with requirements. The wings are are omitted, as, viewing the original form (figure 12), they well might bo. The whole being elevated on a staff, and the original form being lost sight of, the shape is conceived to represent two snakes twisted round one another, the developments at the extremities of the upper members taking, in this instance, the form of heads, the lower dwind 1 Tree and Serpent Worship, Plate x. a, p. 113.</page><page sequence="39">402 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. ling to a point for the tail. Figures 16, 17 show the transition. Figure 16. o Figure 17. If the lower member be omitted, the caduceus assumes the form in which it was sometimes used by priests. There is a bronze specimen (figure 18) in tho British Museum, of date } Figure 18. 440-430 B.C.1 Ilere, it will be observed, the figures can hardly be looked on as twisted snakes, for they have no tails. This has the appearance of a transitional variety ?where the snakes' heads are merely in troduced as an ornament at the ends of the two curved upper arms of the old taurus symbol (comparo fig. 6b). In the Phoeni cian examples alluded to abovo (figure 8b), the same symbol is found. In a coin of Herod I. (h.c. 37-4) 2 the same symbol is depicted, but with two little projections below (figure 19). These projections are certainly not Figure 19. snakes' tails. They are more like small wings, yet the whole symbol has been accepted as representing a caduceus. These instances seem to point to the origin of the caduceus being, not serpents twisted round a staff, but the old taurus symbol developed. There can be little doubt that the celebrated idol of Jagannatha (Vishnu as Krishna) at Puri in Cuttack Avas originally one of these trihtlas* Figure 20, taken from General Cunningham's Bhilsa Topes, represents this well 1 It bears the inscription AONTENAIOS EMI AEMOSI . . . .

Figure 21. I have in my possession a remarkable Indian copper coin, of which a woodcut is given in figure 21. I know of no existing means of identifying this coin, but the form of the figure is archaic. It was given to me by Sir Walter Elliot, who was unable to assign it to any hitherto known series. Tho figure of Vishnu here appears with upraised arms in an attitude singularly recalling the trisul emblem, and the Jagannatha idol above alluded to. That it is clearly intended to represent Vishnu, and no other deity, is shown by the Vaishnava emblem, the tortoise, at the WW Figure 22. side (the Kurma-avatdra). The figures on this coin and at Purl further give rise to the question whether, after all, the mark which Vaishnavas at the present day place on their foreheads (figure 22), and which is generally looked on as some sort of trident, is not another modification of the triiula, the central circle being omitted (compare figure 7). I know of no other reasonable explanation of its form. While recognizing the danger and uselessness of carrying baseless identifications too far?of allowing mere similarities vol. xviii.?[new series.] 27</page><page sequence="41">404 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. of form to influence the mind?I cannot refrain from point ing out with diffidence, and I admit without any sanction of proof, a similarity which struck mo six years ago, and which I have since seen no reason absolutely to reject as absurd. On the angles of the baso of a bronze statuette found in a tomb in the Polledrara cemetery at Vulci in Etruria, and figured in Dennis's Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria (vol. i. p. 423), and Micali's Monumenti Inediti (1844), plate vi. fig. 2, Figtnc 23. is found the annexed figure (fig. 23).l This is in all respects similar to the forms repre sented above. It has all tho members of the scaraboid form so often alluded to?the body, wings, fore-legs, and hind-legs?the only differ ence being that in this instance the curve of the lower members is altered so as to bring the upper and lower limbs into conventional regularity. It must also be noticed that numbers of scarabs have been found in Northern Italy. With reference to its date, the author writes: " Tho antiquity of this bust is proved, not only by the style, but by the workmanship,?not being cast, but being formed of thin plates of bronze hammered into shape, and finished with the chisel ? the earliest mode of Etruscan toreutics." That tho ornament was intended to be looked at in the position in which I have depicted it is clear from its place on the bronzo plinth. Now, if any one will take the trouble to look at this woodcut from the side of the page, instead of holding the page in the usual way, he will observe that the figure is precisely that of a conventional fleur-de-lys. This may be a pure flight of fancy, but still it is noticeable that Northern Italy was, if not the home of the fleur-de-lys, at least one of the sites of its firm adoption. I lay no great stress on this identification, however, contenting myself with simply calling attention to the curious resemblance. The fleur-de-lys has been derived 1 Most unfortuuatcly the portion of bronzo plinth on which the ornament is cut appears never to have found its way to the British Museum, where the rest of the bust is. But Micali it a very accurate and trustworthy copyist, and that the plinth did actually exist is proved by his alluding to it iu his text.</page><page sequence="42">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 405 from a hundred different originals. This is merely a hundred and first. Postscript. Tho Life of Apollonius of Tyiina written by Philostratus has been alluded to above (p. 385). This work is gener ally supposed to be historically valueless. It is possible that Apollonius travelled to India about the year 40 a.d., but it is almost certain that this " Life," which never made its appearance till it was presented to the Empress Julia Domna, the wife of Severus (a.d. 222-235), was a concocted fabrication, based on the information recorded by previous writers. As such, however, it has an importance of its own, which must not be lost sight of. The author of such a work is more careful than even a bond-fide traveller to write nothing that will not be believed. He may exaggerate accepted fallacies, but only because they have been accepted. From this point of view certain passages of this apocryphal " Life of Apollonius," written possibly as lato as the third century a.d., become very valuable for our present purpose. I quote from Priaulx's work. Apollonius is represented as having his first interview with Phraotes, king of Takila;?"The king ordered the Babylonian guide to be treated with the hospitality wont to be shown to travellers from Babylon, and the satrap guide to be sent back home with tho usual travelling allowance," while he converses with Apollonius in Greek and treats him with most marked courtesy. This shows at least that tho Alexandrians of the third century a.d. believed that tho overland journey from Babylon to India was a journey constantly made by travellers, that Babylonians were in the regular habit of making this journey, though Greeks seldom ; that the Indian kings showed much courtesy to the travellers, and that such visits were so frequent that the travelling allowances paid to guides formed a recognized and well-known item of the expenditure of frontier sovereigns. We further learn from the story that the author considered</page><page sequence="43">406 EARLY BDDDHI8T SYMBOLISM. it probable that Greek influence in Northern India had been very extensive. We learn from the narrative that the Greek and Indian Philosophers were mutually acquainted with each other's systems, and held one another in honour?a state of things that confirms tho boast of Asoka alluded to above (p. 375). The same king, Phraotes, tells Apollonius that he had been " brought up by his father in the Greek fashion till the age of twelve; that he was then sent to the Brahmans, and treated by them as a son, for 'they especially love/ he observed, 'those who know and speak Greek, as akin to them in mind and disposition.'1" Passages from Nicolaus Damascenus, Diodorus, Plutarch, Dio Chrysostom, and JElian, corroborate this account of the spread of Greek ideas, and the Greek language, amongst tho Hindus. Later on we are introduced to a dull-witted and un enlightened monarch, who insults Apollonius. Being after wards convinced of his error, we are told, "the king burst into tears .... and attributed his prejudices against the Greeks to tho tales and falsehoods of Egyptian travellers, who, while they boasted of their nation as wise and holy and author of those laws relating to sacrifices and mysteries which obtain in Greece, described the Greeks as men of unsound judgment, tho scum of men .... etc. . . ." Third-century authors, then, believed that India was frequently visited by Egyptian travellers, as well as by Babylonians. It is clear, then, that the author of this " Life of Apol loniiis'1 conceived that he would best impose on the credulity of his age by accepting a very close and frequent inter communication between India, Babylon and Egypt, before and up to the date of Apollonius (40 a.d.), as in the regular nature of things. Had there been no such regular inter communication, he would not have written the passages quoted above.</page><page sequence="44">EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. 407 Note by Sir George Birdwood on the above Paper.1 Every article of Hindu manufacture, excepting the non descript curiosities made for Europeans, had a religious significance, and their ornamentation was all symbolical. For himself, he had no doubt that nearly every symbol in use in India came originally from Mesopotamia. This could not yet be demonstrated in every case; but he hoped the book he was preparing for the press would prove it in a great many cases: and it might be inferred, without direct proof, from tho commercial history of India. Ho could not attribute much to the direct influence of Egypt, for it was operative millenniums before the appearance of the Aryas on the scene of history, yet indirectly it must have had a great initial influence on the development of Aryan arts. Egyptian caravan commerce became continuous with that of Mesopotamia about u.c. 2000, and thus helped to pro pagate a common Egypto-Mesopotamian type of industrial and decorative art from Inner Africa to Central Asia ; and when the Aryas began to move into Persia, and India, and Anterior Asia, and Europe, they moved directly across this line of propagation of Egypto-Mesopotamian handicraft art, and this, probably, largely accounts for the obvious resemblances between the household arts of all the civilized and semi-civilized countries of tho Old World. But the abiding influence of Mesopotamia on India, as still mani fested, particularly in the arts of Southern India, where the effects of the Macedonian conquest were not directly felt, was not developed, until the 7th and 6th centuries b.c, when P8ammetichu8 I. in Egypt, and Nebuchaduezzar III. in Babylonia, first organized the navigation and commerce of tho Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean, as it was carried on down to the conquests of the Saracens. Buddhism itself was the direct result in his (Sir George Birdwood's) 1 This note is tho substance of Sir G. Birdwood's reply to tho President's question whether ho had observed any indications of symbolism in Indiuu textile fabrics, when Mr. Sew ell's paper had been read at the Society's Mcctiug ou the 21st June, 1886.</page><page sequence="45">408 EARLY BUDDHIST SYMBOLISM. opinion, as he had some years ago stated in the Athenwum, of this enlarged commercial intercourse; for Buddhism was simply commercialized, internationalized Hinduism, which reverted at once to the national, strongly anti-commercial type, formulated in " The Code of Manu," as soon as the old overland trade between the East and the West began to be broken up by the Mahomedans. Obviously as Buddhism itself, so its ritualistic symbolism also, must have owed much to the intercourse of the ancient Hindus with Mesopotamia. As to tho swastika aud the triiula being sun-symbols, they were phallic symbols before that. He (Sir George Birdwood) took no interest in phallic symbols until they assumed the poetic form of tho Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life; but there was no doubt in his mind that the swastika was the first symbol of tho Garden of Eden, or before that of woman, and the triiula of the Tree of Life, or before that of man. It was a most interesting circumstance that the latest broch6 silk manufactured for the present London season was all over diapered with the swastika symbol, of the same askew type as is stamped on tho leaden imago of tho Asian Venus found by Schliemann in the ruins of " the 3rd," or " burnt city " (" the Homeric Ilios ") at Hissarlik. 18/A Aug.?Since writing out the above I have purchased at the Colonial and Indian Exhibition a very primitive-looking wooden ladle from Junagahr, where it is used to pour the libations of ghi in the sacrifices to Agni, " the god of fire," 11 the south," etc. The bowl is fashioned as the yoni-lingam symbol, and immediately over it is carved the symbol Anan durarta, "the Country of Bliss," in which the swastika is represented within a square or four-sided enclosure, while at the back of it is carved a tortoise, the universal emblem in the East of fecundity.?G.B.</page></plain_text>
