<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSE M. MUSACCHIO WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? ABSTRACT. In this article, I discuss several of the factors that jeopardize our understanding of the nature of qualitative experiences and the mind. I incorpo rate the view from neuroscience to clarify the na?ve view from the first person perspective. I suggest that the most misleading factor in the understanding the nature of the mind and conscious processes is the transparency of experiences and the imperceptibility of the neurobiological processes that realize them. Trans parency reflects the biological advantages provided to organisms by avoiding the proliferation of superfluous sensing and the regress implied in sensing the sensors and analyzers ad infinitum. The downside of simplicity and the price for biologi cal efficiency is that through introspection, we cannot perceive the inner workings of the brain. Thus, the view from the first person perspective creates the pervasive illusion that the mind is nonphysical. Sensing the environment requires encod ing information into neural surrogates, which I conceive as contingent processes that when incorporated into conscious processes become qualitative experiences. They are cognitive shortcuts with a variable degree of isomorphism, which par tially falsify reality. Thus, the what-it-is-like is not the what-it-is. The first person perspective seemings should be corrected by the objective approach provided by neuroscience. To compensate for the contingency of experiences, organisms learn to rely on the aboutness of associated phenomenal concepts. Experiences have high biological value, because even in the absence of language, they allow organ isms to make intelligent choices. Qualia are also necessary to ground words and language, which are essential to develop higher forms of cognition. 1. INTRODUCTION The puzzle about the nature of phenomenal experiences and the mind is not new, but it has been revived during the last few years in several books and articles. The enigma of qualia relates to different aspects that center around the contrast between subjective or con scious experiences, as viewed from the first person perspective, and the physical nature of the brain. Thus, philosophers ask, "How could the physical brain give rise to conscious experienceV This phrasing begs the question and reveals a metaphysical prejudice by assuming that experiences are nonphysical. I think that the problem originates in the subjective imperceptibility of the neurobiological processes Synthese (2005) 147: 425-460 DOI 10.1007/sl 1229-005-8364-6 ? Springer 2005</page><page sequence="2">426 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO that realize what we call mental or psychological. To establish the nature of conscious experience is probably the most difficult philo sophical problem of all times. We are all aware of having experiences and of being, at least in part, physical entities. Thus, we face the problem of combining the subjective view with the objective view of the world, which includes the relation of phenomenal experiences and the mind to the physical brain. As indicated by Nagel (1986), every creature with the capacity to transcend faces this problem. He also said, "an organism has con scious mental states if and only if there is something it is like to be that organism" (Nagel 1980). In reference to this subject, Chal mers coined the term hard problem when he wrote, "The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience" (Chalmers 1995, 1996). "How can we explain why there is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an emotion?" Chal mers wonders why physical processes give rise to a rich inner life (Chalmers 1995). He believes that experiences cannot be reduced to neural processes, so he supports a property dualism, which pos tulates irreducibly mentalistic properties that do not supervene on the physical. In addition, some philosophers believe in the 'explana tory gap' (Levine 1983), which we encounter when we try to explain qualitative experiences. Our inability to apprehend the quality of experiences through scientific descriptions has been illustrated by Frank Jackson's example of Mary the brilliant scientist, who was isolated since birth in a black-and-white chamber (Jackson 1982). She cannot know what-it-is-like to see colors, even if she has a com plete knowledge of the neurophysiology of vision. Jackson used this example in an attempt to conclude that physicalism is incomplete or false because it leaves something unexplained. (However, Jackson 1998 has since changed his mind.) The overriding intuition of the fundamental differences between the subjective and the objective has been dubbed the 'antipathetic fallacy' by Papineau (1995). As he indicates, we can think about experiences in two different ways. One is from the first person perspective, through which we get the feeling of the experience whereas the view from the third person perspective leaves out that feeling. In this article, I will try to integrate the philosophical and the scientific views of qualitative experiences and the mind. My discus sion will rely heavily on current neurobiological knowledge. I will also mention some of the factors that can mislead us, including sev eral misconceptions that are not generally discussed in this context.</page><page sequence="3">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 427 These misconceptions may obscure not only the language of our questions, but also our answers and beliefs. 2. QUALITATIVE EXPERIENCES ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND FOR SEVERAL REASONS Language is potentially misleading because everyday explanations are tailored to and from the first person perspective, and are accept able from a folk psychological point of view. Ambiguity is usually dispelled by the overall sense and by the context of the discussion. However, in philosophical discussions we need to be more pre cise, because what we have in mind might not be clear to every body, so misunderstandings are frequent. This situation contrasts sharply with scientific explanations, which are less prone to ambigu ity, because they are obtained through the third person perspective. Despite the language-independence of qualitative experiences (Musacchio 2002), language contributes in subtle ways to confuse discussions about the nature of experience. As discussed by Harman (1990), there is an ambiguity in the use of perceptual verbs. We can see something that is known objectively to exist - veridical seeing - or we can mistakenly believe that we see something that actually does not exist, as when Macbeth was hallucinating and saw a dag ger before him. To distinguish between these alternatives, Harman (1990) used "seef to mean hallucinatory seeing and "see*" to refer to seeing a real object. I adopted Harman's idea, but modified the notation1 to make it user-friendlier and to accommodate additional options that are necessary to refer to all the aspects of phenomenal processes and neural surrogates (Musacchio 2005). A similar ambi guity can be found in referring to some of the properties of objects, such as colors. For example, 'red' may refer to an objective property of the surface of a tomato (obj-red) or to what somebody phenom enally sees in a veridical perception, afterimage, illusion or halluci nation as phenomenal red {phe-red). I will refer to the information internalized as a neural surrogate when we look at obj-red as neu-red (Musacchio 2005). 2.1. The Transparency of Experiences Conceals that they are Complex Neural Processes The transparency of experiences is one of its essential qualities that explain not only their role, but also some of their puzzling</page><page sequence="4">428 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO characteristics. Harman indicated that we are only aware of the intrinsic features of the intentional object, but not of the intrinsic features of the experience itself (Harman 1990). Loar also observes that we seem to be directly aware of properties of objects rather than properties of experience itself (Loar 1997). It seems evident that experiences and their aboutness bring us in contact with the external world and with our biological needs. Transparency is used in at least two different senses.2 The transparency of experiences, in the sense of seeing through them refers to two different aspects. One is the diaphanous awareness of phenomenal qualities, and the other is the aboutness or intentionality of the experiences (Section 5). In the negative or 'imperceptibility' sense of transparency, the intrin sic features of experiences are imperceptible to the subject. I will briefly discuss below the first two aspects and then concentrate on the imperceptibility of the neurobiological mechanisms of experi ences that I think generates the illusion of the nonphysical nature of the mind, which is perhaps the most misleading of all our intuitions. In the perceptual sense of transparency, sensory experiences have a phenomenal quality of which we are directly aware. We seem to apprehend directly what we interpret as properties of objects, such as colors, smell or shapes, and of our internal needs and states, such as pain, hunger or emotions (Section 4.1). Transparency in the sense of seeing through produces the feeling of direct perception, in which there seems to be nothing between experiences and us. The experi ence puts us in apparent contact with the phenomenal content that we project to the external world or toward our own body. How ever, as I will discuss, the what-it-is-like is not necessarily what it is (Section 4.3). In addition to their phenomenal character, experiences have an aboutness or intentional sense, which may be transparently evoked through the memories of associated experiences (Section 5). In the negative or imperceptibility sense, transparency means that the first person perspective cannot perceive the intrinsic features of the experience (Harman 1990). The imperceptibility of the neural realizers of experiences has clear biological advantages, but it cre ates the highly misleading illusion that qualia and the mind are non physical entities. A cognitive system that has a limited capacity of perceiving its hardware is simpler and avoids the regress implicit in sensing the sensors and the analyzers, and so on. The imper ceptibility of the neural constituents of the cognitive system con trasts sharply with the richness of everyday experiences. The objects of the external world seem real and clearly physical as opposed to</page><page sequence="5">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 429 the mental, psychological or spiritual, which seem nonphysical and non-spatial. This creates the illusion that the components of the cognitive systems and the mind itself are nonphysical. However, con trary to common sense psychology, science indicates that the pre sumed immateriality of the mind is an illusion. This illusion has misled common folks and some philosophers since the beginning of history. Thus, the anti-physicalist intuitions of folk psychology are derived from the imperceptibility of the intrinsic physical features of the mental or psychological3. The mental - as nonphysical - is an expression of folk psychology at its best (or worst). What is wrong with it is not that the mind does not exist. The mind is quite real; the problem is that the first person perspective cannot perceive its physicality, so it assumes that there is a fundamental ontological difference between mind and brain. I like to stress that the only way to stop the regress of a phenomenal system is to have a limited cognitive structure, which could sense only some of the sensors and mechanisms of aware ness. Sensing all the components of the cognitive system would create an unnecessary biological handicap. Even a limited increase in the size and complexity of the brain would make such organ isms biologically unwieldy. To be efficient the brain machinery must be imperceptible to itself and devoid of biologically irrele vant complexity. The sensory organs have limited nociceptive sensi tivity, but enough for elemental protection and survival. However, the brain that is the ultimate sensor, cannot sense itself. Learning that the brain could not sense itself was one of the most sur prising experiences that I had in medical school. I did not real ize at the time that it was advantageous for the organism to avoid the proliferation of superfluous structures and the regress implied in sensing the sensors ad infinitum. The brain is only protected by the sensitivity of the scalp and by the hardness of the skull. However, the brain has an exquisite sensitivity for the essential nutrients, which are constantly monitored and controlled, such as glucose and the concentration of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. The downside of simplicity and the price for efficiency is that through introspection, we cannot perceive the inner works of the brain. Thus, even if the imperceptibility of the neural states through the first person perspective provides a biological advantage, the resulting illusion is a serious philosophical handicap that drastically diminishes the value of introspection and phenomenology as exclu</page><page sequence="6">430 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO sive methods to explore the nature of the mind. This implies that the cognitive limitations of the first person perspective must be sup plemented by the empirical knowledge provided by science. The imperceptibility of the microscopic in general - what we do not per ceive without instrumental help - has historically suggested super natural or magical forces to explain phenomena that we commonly perceive only at the macroscopic level, such as diseases, fertility, heat, combustion, and life. There are many levels at which to look for explanations and causes. However, many of the truly causal agents are imperceptible to the naked eye and to the first person perspective. Unfortunately, the level of perception and the level of causation do not necessarily coincide. This is why the causal explanations of psychology, sociology, political sciences, etc. do not work - they are superficial and rely on abstract generalizations, which postu late entities that do not have causal efficacy (i.e., the entities postu lated by psychoanalysts to 'explain' psychiatric diseases). The unre strained postulation of ad hoc explanatory entities is useless and cre ates many paradoxes and fallacies. Mental processes, such as experiences and the derived phenom enal concepts, can be conceived as if they were gestalts internally elaborated by the brain. They can be viewed as complex neuro nal processes with distinct physical properties that can signal other parts of the brain. Experiences have aboutness and indexical refer ences, which consist in associated signals that refer to a biological need to be satisfied or to a problem to be solved, without really understanding its complexity in scientific terms. Experiences about biological needs are warning signals, which we learned to quench through their aboutness. Eating because we are hungry is a behav ioral response, like executing a computer program that will initiate a complex series of steps, which we really do not understand. The simultaneous presentation of all the biochemical and neuro physiological events that trigger hunger would obviously overwhelm any perceptual system. Thus, internally generated qualia, like sen sory qualia, funnel information into cognitive shortcuts that act like easily interpretable signals (Section 4.3). The trimming of infor mation involved in the realization of phenomenal processes max imizes the efficiency of the system and minimizes its structural requirements.</page><page sequence="7">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 43 1 2.2. The Fragmentation of Culture Prevents us from Understanding Complex Phenomena that Require a Multidisciplinary Approach Specialization and the ensuing fragmentation of knowledge into apparently independent disciplines and sub-disciplines is one of the generally acceptable, but potentially pernicious developments that threaten the unity of our culture (Snow 1993). The human need to specialize is a manifestation of the limits of our intelligence and abilities, not of the natural boundaries between academic disciplines. Besides the historical precedents, there are no compelling reasons to postulate the division of all that there is into different domains or realms, which later must be linked together through 'bridge laws'. The fragmentation of culture into apparently different disciplines and subdisciplines, such as philosophy, logic, linguistics, psychol ogy or neuroscience, has a detrimental effect in understanding all the aspects of any given subject and the unity of nature. What we call disciplines are occupations or levels of expertise, which may use different methodologies and approaches, but have neither essen tial differences nor sharp limits, as is evident when the boundaries between them are named by combining the roots of their names. In contrast to our initial impulse to divide reality into different realms, there are many examples that illustrate the unity of the phys ical and the mental. The therapeutic or recreational use of psycho active drugs amounts to an empirical demonstration of the unity of the physical brain and mental processes. Thus, I believe that psychological or mental processes are not different from the neu ral processes that realize them. The mental-physical or mind-brain dichotomy is the product of the illusions generated through the first person perspective. Folk psychologists consider the mental or psychological as nonphysical, but to my knowledge, this has never been demonstrated. On the contrary, there is plenty of evidence indicating that the mental consists in neural processes. As I indi cated above, the illusion of the existence of the mental or spiri tual as a different realm is the byproduct of the imperceptibility of the neurophysiological and biochemical mechanisms that realize 'psychological' processes. The subjective folk perspective does not have the final word either in science or in philosophy. However, my previous pessimism about the future of philosophy is slowly changing into hope, because it is reassuring to see the beginning of many multidisciplinary studies on complex subjects, such as con scious processes, language, perception and neuroscience. There have</page><page sequence="8">432 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO been several important works published during the last few years that integrate philosophy, psychology and neuroscience.4 3. WHAT DO I MEAN BY EXPLAINING? We are complex organisms and biological approaches have been instrumental in explaining our body functions, so we expect to use the same approach to explain our minds. The empirical suc cess of neural sciences, from neurochemistry to psychiatry, indi cates that it is reasonable to search in them for explanations that other approaches have been unable to provide. Thus, by explain ing I mean to identify the elements involved in the causal chain of events that realize mental functions and to be able to inter vene therapeutically when necessary. Nevertheless, this is easier said than done. The task is complex and we have to fill large gaps in our knowledge. For example, we still do not know all the micro physical processes involved in moving a single finger, but there is no doubt that it consists in neural processes involving the motor area of the cortex, several subcortical structures and the cerebel lum. It also depends on sensory proprioceptive inputs that indi cate the initial position of fingers, hands and arms. Despite all our knowledge, we only have a general view of the chain of events involved. However, what we know has been corroborated by countless studies in normal and pathological conditions. Need less to say, our ignorance becomes more evident when we try to explain mental functions that have a heavy phenomenologi cal component that we perceive though the first person perspec tive. We can undoubtedly identify many of the structures and processes involved in phenomenal experiences. The study of certain diseases, such as depression and our capacity to intervene therapeutically cer tainly indicate that neuroscientific knowledge is essential to provide any reasonable explanation of mental phenomena. Scientific explana tions are propositional and progressively describe the elements of a function and their causal relations at lower levels of organization and in finer details. This is to say that biological explanations are reduc tive, as discussed below. Thus, macroscopic or global explanations are never sufficient, because the constant improvement of our ana lytical methods allow us to elaborate better explanations by identify ing lower and lower levels of microscopic causation. This obviously</page><page sequence="9">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 433 creates the problem of deciding how reductive an explanation should be to be acceptable. Explanations are initially limited to a single set of problems, but as our knowledge progresses, we require explanations that go from the purely descriptive and apparent, to lower and lower levels of organization, which are not easily perceptible. In biol ogy, this means adopting a reductive strategy, from whole popu lations and organisms, to physiological, biochemical, and physical chemical processes, until we actually enter an apparently 'differ ent' discipline, in which we have no expertise, such as determining the structure of protein molecules, atoms and subatomic particles, including their quantum mechanical interactions. Ideally, scientific explanations are reductive (Bickle 1998). However, the road is not easy, because individual scientists only have time and expertise to clarify how a few pieces fit together in a remote corner of the puz zle. Current explanations in neurobiology rely on neurophysiological and biochemical causes. They are extremely useful in terms of allow ing us to intervene therapeutically. In many cases, we are able to provide explanations at several levels of organization, but as indi cated by Bickle and Mandik (2002), we are still missing some of the 'glue' that binds all the levels. Thereby, we need to avoid parochial approaches and look outside our 'disciplines' for analogies and iso morphic relations to find the bridges between the different levels or much more general theories. Despite our ignorance, we have made enormous progress during the last century. The physicality of experiences can be verified by pharmacological, surgical or electrical manipulations of the brain structures in which these processes are realized. Moreover, the dis covery of additional neurochemical processes in these structures, allows us to make additional predictions and to intervene therapeu tically to modify or suppress unwanted experiences. For example, it has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt that we can modify phe-p'diri, and inhibit pathological anxiety, panic attacks and partially control endogenous depression. Even if we do not have complete explanations, experiences can be identified with certain neural pro cesses, which can be detected or disrupted by many different phys ical or pharmacological procedures (fMRI, electroencephalogram, event related potentials (ERP), magneto encephalography, adminis tration of different drugs, transcranial magnetic stimulation, etc.). Explaining phenomenal processes is in its beginnings, but everything</page><page sequence="10">434 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO indicates that we are on the right track, even if we know that the road ahead is long and has many detours. We know with certainty that the state of the brain is as incognos cible as is the position and velocities of each individual molecule in a gas. This should not be a deterrent, because by analogy, we could elaborate theories that would help us to understand complex sys tems. The brain is estimated to have about 1011 neurons classified in approximately one thousand different types (Kandel et al. 2000); they form complex networks, with anything from 10,000 to 150,000 contacts per cell. They have a complex internal structure with many cell organd?es and compartments, thousands of different proteins that form channels for different ions, transporters and receptors for hundreds of different neurotransmitters, neurorregulators and hor mones. Moreover, the complexity of the electrical properties of neu rons and neuronal networks is staggering. Given this complexity, it is easy to understand that complex systems are incognoscible in detail at any given time (Prigogine and Stengers 1984; Gell-Mann 1994). Heisenberg's uncertainty principle should be extended to the dynam ics of the brain and the multiplicity of its components. It is rarely stated by neuroscientists that it is impossible to determine the struc ture and the state of all the molecules and constituents of a sin gle neuron at any given time. Detecting one component, lets say one enzyme or receptor out of two or three thousands, usually alters the overall structure and chemical composition of the neuron, such that the analysis of more than one or two additional components is impossible. Thus, our knowledge of the brain is some kind of tem poral-spatial collage that we can only understand in principle, but its complexity is such that we cannot obtain an instant picture of all the components of an experience at any given instant. Explanations have a series of characteristics that I like to stress. Explanations, even those that refer to different levels of organiza tion, should be related to higher and lower levels of organization, but obviously, their conclusions cannot be contradictory. Another important characteristic that is rarely stressed is that explanations are propositional, so they are not necessarily immediately satisfac tory to the first person perspective. We have to learn to overcome the contradictions evoked by the apparent incongruence between propositional explanations and phenomenological satisfaction. Such folk psychological contradictions are sometimes exploited for dra matic effects, as when somebody asks how a physical system could give rise to love, joy or pain.</page><page sequence="11">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 435 Propositional explanations develop in the right direction if we can empirically verify some of the steps involved by manipulat ing the system for therapeutic purposes. However, we should be aware that descriptive empirical explanations could never satisfy the wishes of the first person perspective. It should be clearly under stood that the most that we can do is to prove the identity between an experience and a complex series of neurobiological processes. Once we empirically verify an identity, we do not need additional explanations, as argued by Papineau (1998). The problem is that some phenomenologically oriented philosophers seem to expect that a neurobiological explanation should satisfy the yearnings of the first person perspective. The need for more general theories is obvious, but actually, it is hard to formulate them for processes that are not completely known. Thus, we have to resort to modeling the activity of brain functions at many different levels and at different times. There have been several successful attempts to devise models of neural networks that could duplicate some functions in silico. These are heuristic approaches that have been championed by theoreticians and com puter scientists. Unfortunately, I cannot review in the space avail able, the many excellent books and monographs that summarize these approaches (Churchland and Sejnowski 1992; Koch and Davis 1994; Abbott and Sejnowski 1999; O'Reilly and Munakata 2000; Bickle and Mandik 2002). However, the fact that simple systems can be modeled does not mean that by doing so, we will be able to truly understand ourselves. Moreover, we do not only have to model nor mal functions, but we also should be able to use the same models to explain diseases, which are an aspect of our biology that we cannot ignore. 4. QUALITATIVE EXPERIENCES CONSIST IN THE AWARENESS OF INTERNALIZED INFORMATION Sensing the external world is our most basic cognitive ability, which naturally developed before anybody knew anything about knowl edge, philosophy or language. Today, as evolved creatures, we can reflect and say with confidence that the survival of animals and humans has been made possible by sensing the environment and by knowing about food and predators. Knowledge is achieved through a series of complex processes by which biological sys tems accumulate information about the world and about themselves.</page><page sequence="12">436 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO Russell (1912) divided conscious knowledge into knowledge by acquaintance - that I prefer to call phenomenal knowledge - and knowledge by description - propositional knowledge (Musacchio 2002, 2005). It seems evident today that phenomenal knowledge is clearly the result of biological processes, which as such they are not cognoscible through the first person perspective. Experiences have been the sub ject of philosophical analysis probably ever since it was discovered that they could not be described through propositions. In contrast, propositional knowledge has traditionally received the attention of philosophers, most likely because it is the media on which to argue about philosophical problems. Besides, propositions are thought to be analyzable with introspective non-empirical methods. However, to analyze propositional knowledge, also requires, in addition to knowing about language, knowing about the biological roots of learning, logic and reason. These problems have been traditionally ignored by rationalist philosophers, who usually negate, ? la Frege, the need for empirical research.5 We take sensing for granted, but sensing is not a simple pro cess, because neither the external world objects nor their properties can be internalized as what they are. Most discussions on epistemol ogy traditionally center on propositional knowledge. However, the problems of sensing the environment and internalizing the resulting information should be discussed first, because phenomenal knowl edge is an absolute prerequisite for developing propositional knowl edge and the capacity to reason using symbols. The problem of internalizing information through the senses has been solved practi cally and expediently by Nature with the development of qualitative experiences. However, qualitative experiences falsify reality, because we actually do not perceive things as what they are. We live in a Platonic cave, in which we manage to survive by learning to inter pret the aboutness of our phenomenal experiences (Section 5). How ever, before getting to aboutness, I will discuss the problems of sens ing and internalizing information, neural encoding, and incorpora tion of neural surrogates into conscious processes. 4.1. Sensing and Internalizing Information are Complex Problems We have the compelling impression that we perceive the world as it is, but neither the objects nor their properties can be directly appre hended as what they actually are. Thus, it was assumed by early</page><page sequence="13">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL' 437 philosophers and scientists that we could internalize images or impressions that faithfully represented the external world. The prob lem with this early assertion is that it requires a mind's eye or internal observers that imply regress. However, despite the many problems in understanding sensing, we know that knowledge is pos sible, even though it is probably limited and distorted. Aristotle already thought that we could perceive three-dimensional space and temporal intervals by sensing them through more than one sen sory modality, such as vision, touch, hearing, etc. (Aristotle 1986). Besides, we know empirically that we can modify successfully some of the components of the external world. The empirical success gives us additional confidence that the world is probably cognosci ble, even if our knowledge is initially indirect and we cannot per ceive the intrinsic features of what seems real. The crucial question is whether experiences provide direct and genuine knowledge of the intrinsic properties of external objects and organic needs, as a realist would think, or if only seems that they do it. The evidence is contradictory; on one hand, we know that we can accurately perceive shapes and the space that immediately surround us. On the other hand, we know that we are subjected to illusions, and that we tend to believe at first blush that things are just the way they seem to us. For example, we know that when we perceive the red color - obj-red - of a ripe tomato, we experience phe-red (Musacchio 2005). However, we know that phe-red is not a prop erty intrinsic to any external object, but a surrogate impression elab orated by the senses and the brain. This means that the first person perspective does not have access either to the intrinsic properties of the objects nor to the intrinsic properties of the experience itself, as Harman (1990) indicated. This implies that introspection has fatal flaws, if it is not complemented by empirical knowledge. I will only say here that phenomenal knowledge is the most basic and essential form of knowledge, without which we would not be able to know anything else.6 Even though sensing is essential for knowledge, not all philosophers seem to be concerned about how we actually internalize information through the senses. To under stand sensing, we cannot rely only on introspection. The first per son perspective is unable to provide an objective insight into the nature of what we actually internalize and perceive. First, we must be aware of the biology of our senses and cognition. There are some hard facts that are not evident to the first person perspec tive and that should be taken into account to understand sensing</page><page sequence="14">438 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO (Gardner and Martin 2000). We - our brains - can only internalize nerve action potentials produced by the senses, so we do not have a direct way to experience what we call the reality or the external world. Action potentials not only encode and transmit informa tion within the organism, but also transmit information to other humans; information must be encoded into a conventional lan guage, signals or behavioral clues. The information elaborated by the senses and entering the brain cannot be transformed back into the original stimuli (such as light, air vibrations, odorant molecules). Thus, we have to understand the world indirectly, through the action potentials internalized by the senses. We have no alternatives. Under standing is achieved through several processes, such as internaliz ing information through other senses, as proposed by Aristotle and by taking into account the aboutness provided by associated experi ences. All the evidence available suggests that we perceive only sig nals which, even if they are reliable physical transformations, are also unrecognizable as such and do not have any intrinsic meaning or aboutness (Section 5). In addition to the qualitative experiences generated from the external world - exoqualia - we have direct access to the endoge nously generated qualia - endoqualia - that are sui generis, contin gent experiences, such as thirst, hunger, satiety, nausea and sexual desire. They are generated by the needs of the organism and by its relation with the external environment. Endoqualia are experiences that allow organisms' sensing and satisfying internal needs. They are cognitive shortcuts that, despite their relatively low degrees of iso morphism, have high survival value because they are associated to a specific aboutness. Some experiences, such as emotions and pain, are hardwired to rapidly trigger biologically advantageous responses. In lower animals, some of these states might not even be conscious. The physical agents that trigger exoqualia are easily identifiable in general, but in the case of endoqualia, the task is not so simple. Such is the case of experiences that refer to organic needs (hunger, thirst) or to the self, such as fear, love, depressive feelings and other emotional states. These experiences are highly influenced by innate instinctual components, such as the sexual drive. All these consider ations indicate that internal qualitative experiences are a direct, non verbal, biological language by which all organisms are motivated to satisfy their organic needs, even without knowing what they are doing. There is no doubt that endoqualia are major factors that shape our culture and influence most forms of human and animal behavior.</page><page sequence="15">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 439 Today, we know that emotions are physical states that process endogenous information about the organism in its relation to the environment. Unknown through the first person perspective, all emotional processes are realized in specific neural circuits (LeDoux 1995), which are mediated by changes in neurotransmitters, hor mones and other cellular messengers. The effects of drugs, electrical brain stimulation, anatomical lesions, etc., as well as electrophysio logical and fMRI studies show that emotions are physicochemical processes that take place in the brain. This seems true, even if most of the details are still missing. These aspects, as well as their neuro biological bases (of fear, at least), have been thoroughly examined in several reviews and recent trade books by LeDoux (1995, 1996, 2000, 2002). The aboutness of endoqualia, which provide clues to satisfy the needs of the organism or restore its internal equilibrium, is derived not only from additional experiences, but also from innate com ponents characteristic of the species (Section 5). The awareness of endoqualia motivates animals and humans to use their intelligence to achieve organic equilibrium by resorting either to socially accept able, opportunistic or deceptive behavior. 4.2. Internalized Information is Encoded as Neural Surrogates The obvious problem is that since nothing can be internalized as what it is, the internalized information must be interpreted as reality itself, even if it is only a de facto, contingent identity. This is not as odd as it might seem, because neural analogues act as de facto iden tities of the properties and objects of the external world. Thus, even if neural surrogates are only partially isomorphic to elements of the external world, they are physical transforms that constitute the most basic way to internalize information about the world. Neural ana logues create the surrogate reality in which we live. A neural surrogate can be conceived as a contingent brain state that is a physical transform of a sensory input, with a variable degree of encoded isomorphism for the different senses, but with out any image-like resemblance to the original stimulus. The subjec tive problem is to understand how it is possible that being aware of a neural process seems like actually perceiving something real and objective. At this point, we should remember that the objective real ity - i.e. the light reflectance of a ripe tomato - is not internalizable as such and is incognoscible through the first person perspective.</page><page sequence="16">440 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO Thus, our impression of perceiving things as what they actually are is an illusion. The only phenomenal knowledge that we could derive from obj-red is through perceiving the corresponding surro gate, neu-red (Musacchio 2005). Thus, a neural surrogate is an inter nal equivalent, a physical process,7 which is actually 'perceived' as a phenomenal experience when it is bound into conscious processes (Section 4.4). Perceiving neu-red as phe-red is the only way in which we can sense obj-red. Even if the equivalence between internalized sensory information and objective reality is contingent upon the evolution of our senses, and only has a low or negligible degree of isomorphism, the reliability of the transforms provide empirical sig nals that allow us to deal successfully (most of the time) with the external world. In this fashion, phe-red becomes a de facto identity with obj-red. Besides, our perceptions seem so evident that we real ize only through the propositional knowledge of science that phe-red is actually not identical to obj-red. Even so, most folks still believe that we perceive colors as how they actually are. Recognizing shapes and objects is a learned process, as it can be inferred from individuals with congenital cataracts. Zeki sum marizes reports describing individuals who were born blind because of congenital cataracts as having extreme difficulties in 'learning to see' after the removal of the opaque lenses (Zeki 1993). Even tually they recover the capacity to see, but they have difficulties in recognizing - even after several years - objects that they knew well by touch before the operation. It was initially assumed that children could withstand the congenital cataracts operation better just before their teens. However, it was rapidly learned that if the opaque lenses were not removed during early childhood, older chil dren would never really learn to see well. The finding that patients operated on late in childhood fail to recognize objects and faces by sight can be explained today by the profound effects that sight deprivation has on the physical development of the visual cortex. The brain is not a ready-to-use gadget; the morphogenic effect of usage, as described for the visual system, is essential for its develop ment. Not everything is in the genes, simply because we do not have enough genes to encode the complex structure of the brain. With language, vision and perhaps with most of the higher functions of the nervous system, the morphogenic effect of experience is essen tial to develop the structures that subserve the function. Moreover, the period during which experience is able to contribute to the devel opment of a function is very short. Additional examples of missing</page><page sequence="17">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 441 the plasticity window include the impossibility of learning, after a certain age, a language without accent, higher mathematics or fig ure ice-skating. That experiences have a morphogenetic effect in syn apses has been repeatedly demonstrated in many systems (Kandel 2000; Blair et al. 2001; Martin and Morris 2002). I assume, from what I know about the brain, that the neural surrogate that encodes straight lines is neither a line nor anything straight, but rather encoded information. Whatever forms the neural encoding takes, it seems that we learn to interpret the internalized isomorphic information as a signal for straight lines. It is not clear how this takes place, but the experience is probably a learned inter pretation, to which additional experiences by touch and other senses may contribute, as Aristotle already suspected (Aristotle 1986). This implies that the enormous plasticity of the cortex can model tri dimensional space, natural processes and behaviors, in a pragmatic fashion that allows us to navigate the world with some success. The use of one sensory system can influence the perceptions through another system, in the sense that the information can be transferred across modalities (Stein and Meredith 1993). Kandel and Wurtz (2000) proposed that visual perception is a creative process. I think that we can safely generalize and conclude that sensing through different modalities is a self-correcting creative process. Actually, the same could be said about logical thinking. Our knowledge of the external world progresses through different stages of understanding. Children and common folks believe that the world is just the way it looks. Perception uses clues that are not always valid, because they can produce a variety of optical and other illusions. Early philosophers and scientist believed in a repre sentational theory that required internal observers and was open to charges of regress. Today, we know that even if sensory information falsifies the nature of what we perceive, we can overcome appear ances and understand through propositional knowledge not only the external world, but (hopefully) the cognitive mechanisms of our brains. Thus, even if we live in some kind of Platonic cave, we are already aware of the illusory character of some of our sensations. 4.3. Qualia are Cognitive Shortcuts with a High Survival Value As I discussed in the previous sections, the senses transduce objec tive stimuli, the what-it-is, into neural surrogates, which encode sen sory information with different degrees of isomorphism, depending</page><page sequence="18">442 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO on the different senses. When the neural surrogates are incorporated into conscious processes, they become experiences, which generate phenomenal concepts or the what-it-is-like. Humans in a primitive environment and animals have no choice but to operate in a prag matic fashion, without really understanding what they are sensing. Initially, we have to deal with Nature in a qualitative, naive fash ion and by taking our percepts at face value. Later, the integra tion of the views from the first and third person perspectives will allow us to slowly overcome the natural limitations of our percep tive machinery. In our early stages of intellectual development, we all believed that we perceive things as what they are, but the illusory nature of some sensations and perceptions has been known since Aristotelian times. We know today that the degree of isomorphism of our perceptions varies between the different senses. The knowl edge of the surrounding space should be as accurate as necessary for competitive survival.8 The same can be said about the perception of time, movement and other parameters. From a biological perspec tive, qualia are essential for sensing, encoding and evaluating the environment for acting intelligently. Experiences transform complex environmental variables into qua litative values that are directly perceptible. However, the organolep tic properties that we detect through experiences are not identical to the physical properties of objects. The sweet taste of sugar is not identical to the chemical properties of sugar, even if some of the molecular properties of sugar are what stimulate the tongue recep tors for 'sweetness'. Organisms that taste essential food components will survive better than those that do not. Thus, liking sweets is a 'positive' trait for survival. However, the over-consumption of food in affluent societies lead to the invention of artificial sweet eners to trick the taste receptors and lower the calories consumed. This shows that the taste receptors for sweetness do not actually detect high-calorie foods, but only some of its molecular character istics, which are mimicked with a different degree of success by the artificial sweeteners. This is another example showing that the what it-is-like is not the what-it-is. Everything suggests that the transfor mation of different stimuli into a qualitative, language-independent experience provides a simple and efficient solution to the biological need for rapid identification of complex stimuli. The internaliza tion and manipulation of every bit of information from the out side world would have overwhelmed the analytical capacity of any organism. The drawback of qualitative experiences is that we must</page><page sequence="19">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 443 learn for each quale their aboutness through additional experiences (Section 5). Knowledge of the surroundings is essential for humans and many animals. The perception and the conceptualization of space is a highly creative process to which most of the sensory modalities con tribute. They include vision, touch, balance (equilibrium), propri oception (position sense and control of movement), and hearing. Even the perception of pain, itch and temperature contribute to cre ate our 'body image', which is of course three-dimensional. Learn ing and memory are essential components to map the personal and interpersonal spaces, to orient and to move within its coordinates. We know about the contribution of many sensory modalities to our knowledge and utilization of space, because different brain lesions produce specific perceptual deficits (Critchley 1953; Bottini et al. 1994; Marshall and Fink 2001). Moreover, some of the errors and illusions in the perception of space by one sensory modality can be corrected by the contributions of the other senses. The redun dancy and the abundance of information about space indicate that awareness of our surroundings is an essential parameter for surviv ing. The capacity of different animals to sense different aspects of space perception is dependent not only on their size, but also on the particular environment in which the different species are adapted to live. The convergence and integration of the different versions of space that we internalize, contributes to build the accuracy of the space mapping. Thus, we can say with confidence that in reference to space, the what-it-is-like and the what-it-is are almost isomorphic. This is obviously limited to the scale and dimensions within which our perceptions take place. We should remember that it took us many millennia to understand the planetary system and the micro scopic structure of our bodies. The awareness and modeling of space utilizes many structures of the brain in which sensory information is first fed, and also utilizes several specialized structures in the frontal lobe and in the in the hippocampus, where space is literally mapped (Best et al. 2001). This indicates that as opposed to other sense-data (colors, taste, odors, etc.), there is a marked degree of isomorphism between the surrounding space and the neural analogues that map and encode space in the brain. The transformation of complex details of the external world into qualitative experiences is an expedient way to decrease the amount of information incorporated into conscious processes. It is obvi ously more efficient to transform some of the data into something</page><page sequence="20">444 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO that is perceived as a gestalt or quality of an 'objective' color, than to internalize the complex quantitative information necessary to describe faithfully the light reflectance spectrum of an object. The biological solution falsifies reality, but it is more efficient in deal ing with prey and predators. The qualitative character of sensory experiences provides signals that are simple and easily interpretable through their aboutness. If we had to analyze and quantitate the complex frequencies of the air vibrations produced by a lion's roar before we could decide what to do, we would not have survived natural selection. Thus, the assignment of qualities to quantitatively different phenomena has a high survival value. Information about the external world is internalized as a col lage of qualia that is progressively more understandable through sci entific analysis, a complex process that requires a combination of empirical and rational approaches. It is obvious that the senses have not been designed, but have evolved by the cumulative effects of random mutations. Each mutation has to be either advantageous or neutral to be transmitted to the next generation. We do not know about the thousands of models of senses that have failed, but we can be sure that those that are still around have contribute significantly to the survival of the extant species. In anthropomorphic terms, one drawback of the randomness of evolution is that once a prototype sense organ evolved, it could not be redesigned in the same spe cies. If the environment changes abruptly, the species either adapts to alternative ways or perishes. Sensory qualia are subjective signals that provide an expedient pragmatic knowledge about the environment. In addition, they pro vide a language-independent knowledge that is obviously essential for animals and humans. Besides, they provide us with the funda mental elements for developing language and propositional knowl edge. Despite their ineffability, we refer to qualitative experiences by giving them a name, a process that serves to ground words in the phe nomenal (Musacchio 2005). The assumption that homologous expe riences are almost identical in most humans is probably correct, because our common phylogenetic heritage insures the similarity of the transducing machinery and neural surrogates elaborated in our brains. Qualia can be affected by physical agents that modify the activity of the brain. They range from the administration of drugs, electri cal or magnetic stimulation of the brain, to the profound and irre versible alterations produced by brain diseases. Besides, the neural</page><page sequence="21">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 445 structures in which qualia are realized are genetically determined. The possibility of modifying, suppressing, or triggering qualitative experiences through physicochemical means, attests to the complex ity, physicality and functional nature of their intrinsic mechanisms. There are no indications that there is something nonphysical about qualitative experiences. From the first person perspective, it is impossible to understand that the phenomenal properties that we experience are the percep tion of neural analogues or internal surrogates elaborated by the brain. There are several reasons that contribute to cover up the illu sory nature of the process. One is the fact that the qualities per ceived are projected as belonging to where the information comes from. Animals learn by trial and error and with the contribution of the other senses to locate correctly the origin of the stimuli and to proceed accordingly. The second reason is that the microphysical realizers of the neural surrogates are imperceptible, as discussed in Section 2.2. Thus, phe-red seems to refer to the ripe tomato, not to the temporal lobe cortex, where neu-red is elaborated. The evidence reviewed also indicates that qualia are not intrin sic properties of what is being sensed, but are determined by the physicochemical processes that take place in specific areas of the brain. Thus, sensory qualia are not intrinsic properties of the object detected, but they are neural equivalents or diagnostic shortcuts that in a language-independent fashion avoid information overload. Com mon folks not only think that the what-it-is-like is what it is, but they are incredulous when explained that colors do not exist in the external world. The pruning of biologically superfluous infor mation by generating qualia makes it possible not only to sense the external environment rapidly, but also to reduce the number of parameters to analyze. This results in rapid decisions and in higher probabilities for survival. The encoding of complex inputs into a single quale requires internalizing only enough information to produce a signal, which is rapidly related to the aboutness of the experience. Encoding into qualia is an efficient process that produces language-independent cognitive shortcuts, in which some of the quantitative characteristics of the stimuli are transformed into qualitative differences. Despite the misrepresentation of the world implicit in qualitative experiences, they are essential elements for survival and for the development and evolution of intelligent behav ior and conscious processes, as we will discuss below. Animals sense a variety of signals from the environment, which are essential to</page><page sequence="22">446 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO detect the presence of food, prospective mates and predators. These signals may trigger different responses, from an unconscious and mechanical stereotyped behavior to an intelligent assessment of the situation, followed by the most advantageous response. Animals also respond with an emotional state that is essential to set in motion and to orchestrate an appropriate behavior, such as flight or fight. Humans and higher animals perceive space and time with a rela tively high degree of isomorphism. In contrast, the sensory informa tion from taste and smell, as well as from the internal environment, consists of contingent phenomenal signals that falsify the nature of what is perceived. However, the qualitative experiences originating in the internal environment are associated with reliable aboutness that provides crucial information in terms of survival. In addition to their aboutness, the rewarding or aversive properties of experi ences are biologically significant. However, neural information does not have to be conscious to have causal efficacy. We walk or drive unconsciously, avoiding obstacles and taking notice only about the dangerous or unexpected. We also withdraw from hot or obnox ious stimuli, even before we consciously perceive them. I think that the transformation of quantitatively different stimuli into graded qualitative equivalents provides a language-independent, simple and efficient solution to the biological need for rapid discrimination between complex stimuli. In the process, however, reality is falsified - not only through phenomenal experiences, but also through com mon sense knowledge. 4.4. Qualia Consist in the Incorporation of Neural Surrogates into Conscious Processes through Binding The general concept of neural surrogates has considerable explana tory power. When they are not incorporated into conscious processes, they can account for the existence of 'unfelt pains', unat tended sensations, unconscious processes, etc. They also can account for the automatic responses to sensory input that take place even before the organism consciously perceives the stimulus and for all the memories as well as for the phenomenal and propositional con cepts that we acquire through our lifetime. When the neural surro gates are incorporated into conscious processes, they can account not only for normal experiences, but also for dreams, illusions, hallucinations, phantom pains, etc. In addition, the physicality of</page><page sequence="23">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 447 neurophysiological processes and neural surrogates dissolves the problem of the 'mental' causation.9 Since experiences are transparent, our intuitions cannot be used as reliable sources to understand either the nature of experiences or how the brain operates. All seemings are potentially misleading, so the problem of the nature of experiences must be approached from the third person perspective. Besides, we need a vocabulary that implies neither images nor observers.10 The internalized infor mation contained in the neural surrogates must be incorporated into conscious processes, but as we have seen, the intrinsic features of the experience are not perceptible. Thus, we integrate in our conscious processes only some of the distinguishing features of the different neural surrogates - what we can call their gestalt, just to use an already coined term. Through the first person perspective, we have the undeniable impression that we can hold images in mind, dream about them, and recall them at will. Obviously, we do not have a detailed answer to how neural encoding takes place, but there is a lot of informa tion on some of the processes involved (Churchland and Sejnowski 1992; Koch and Davis 1994; Abbott and Sejnowski 1999; O'Reilly and Munakata 2000; Bickle and Mandik 2002). The question that remains unanswered is how is it possible to experience 'mental images' when we know that there are no such things in the brain? There seems to be no doubt that the information is encoded mainly in the cortex and cortico-subcortical circuits, but there are no indi cations whether the information must be decoded or how this could be achieved. Decoding seems to require an observer and creates regress or some kind of Cartesian theater. Perhaps the relative iso morphism of the transform is directly incorporated into conscious processes through binding, without the need of decoding. The idea that this may require an observer might be a carryover from Des cartes assumption of the existence of internal images. The integration of the neural surrogates into conscious pro cesses seems to be dependent on the same mechanisms that con trol awareness. More that half a century ago, neurologists and neurosurgeons discovered that small tumors or cysts in the base of the brain or in the pituitary gland produced progressive loss of consciousness and coma, which in some cases were revers ible after the operation. Moreover, neurosurgeons discovered that a minimal disturbance in the brain stem was followed by loss of consciousness (Penfield 1963). Additional studies made evident</page><page sequence="24">448 JOS? M. MUSACCHIO that the mechanisms of wakefulness, sleep and maintenance of consciousness are distributed through an activating system that includes the hypothalamus, the mesencephalic part of the brain stem and some thalamo-cortical circuits.11 Today we know that wake fulness is associated with low-amplitude, high-frequency electroen cephalogram, whereas deep-sleep (physiological unconsciousness) is characterized by high-amplitude, low-frequency waves (Bauer 2004; Coenen 1998; Evans 2003). In addition, the level of consciousness during anesthesia can be accurately predicted by sophisticated anal ysis of the electroencephalogram (John 2002). The incorporation of neural surrogates into conscious processes is thought to occur by binding. At this writing, binding at '40 Hz' (or gamma band, 30-70 Hz) is the most acceptable neurobiological metaphor for con scious processes. Many recent studies of cognition have been conducted on the visual system, probably because it has the largest capacity to inter nalize high volumes of information in an almost isomorphic fash ion. Processing of visual information starts already in the retina, where different cells capture different elements of the sensation and project it to the occipital cortex through two major pathways.12 From the occipital cortex, parallel pathways convey information to the posterior parietal cortex (dorsal pathway that provides the 'where') and inferior temporal areas (ventral pathway that provides the 'what'). Thus, the information is not projected to the brain as if it were a picture. Color, motion, depth, shape, contours, distance, etc. are processed in multiple cortical areas in a parallel distributed processing. Thus, the neural surrogates corresponding to the differ ent elements of the retinal image must be brought together again by multiple stages of binding (Humphreys 2003). To complicate things further, color and form are processed almost simultaneously, but movement perception is delayed about 50 milliseconds (Viviani and Aymoz 2001). This implies that the coherence of the visual per ception is dependent on several analytical processes, the results of which must be reconstituted in time and space. As stated by Kandel and Wurtz (2000), visual perception is a creative process. Magnetic tapes, DVDs and memory chips encode images and sounds, which we cannot perceive without the benefits of the appro priate transducing machinery. In an analogy, we could reason that, in addition to the mechanisms that encode information in the brain, we also need a system to decode the information during percep tual awareness or when we recall, dream or hallucinate something.</page><page sequence="25">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 449 However, at this point we must resist the temptation of postulating an 'observing self, which would imply a mind's eye or a Cartesian theater and regress. Thus, we have to accept that what are incor porated into conscious processes through binding are the partially isomorphic neural surrogates. Neural surrogates (conceived as neu rophysiological processes of different complexity), provide a physi cally encoded, internalized analogue that requires neither decoders nor observers, but binding to their aboutness and to the phenome nal collage that we call our self. The self could be conceived as the integration of the innate phy logenetic endowment of the species with the repository of our life experiences and aspirations. Past memories are integrated with pres ent experiences in an always-changing modular, dynamic entity. I believe that the ever-changing self derives its versatility from the binding of constantly changing brain processes. It is composed of brain modular activities that are distributed and integrated or bound together in time and space by the general mechanisms of awareness, which include the activity of the brain stem and ret iculo-thalamic mechanisms that synchronize neuronal oscillations (Steriade et al. 1996; Llin?s et al. 1998). The modularity of the self is inferred from the multiple examples of fragmentation produced by neurological lesions (i.e.: achromatopsia, prosopoagnosia, ste reoagnosia, anosognosia, Anton's syndrome, neglect, phantom pain, etc.). We are aware of our physical body, not because it belongs to us, but because it is wired to 'our' brains, which internalize and integrate all proprioceptive information. The information about the body becomes part of the body scheme (Critchley 1953) and the self. We are 'our' functional brains.13 Actually, we are some of the always-changing functions of 'our' brains. Caring for the self is encoded in aversive and reinforcing emotional experiences that result in the preservation of the integrity of the system through feedback mechanisms. This results in the survival of those organ isms that are able to make the best choices. The unity of the self is dependent on the integrity of the brain. A variety of brain lesions and the consequences of cutting the corpus callosum and other interhemispheric commissures in humans (Sperry 1985; Gazzani ga 1998) demonstrate the modularity of the self. The self disap pears entirely during deep surgical anesthesia, deep coma or after death. All these observations have important philosophical consequences, because they imply that ontologically, consciousness is neither a thing</page><page sequence="26">450 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO nor a substance, but a collection of biological functions consisting in a variety of rapidly changing processes. This is to say that consciousness is a collection of processes, which incorporate not only the current experiences, but also all our current thoughts and emotional states. This is why conscious processes refer better than consciousness to the collection of processes that we are. The capac ity of the mechanisms of awareness to focus on current percep tions, phenomenal or propositional concepts or on any aspect of the self eliminates the need to postulate different kinds of conscious ness. 5. THE ABOUTNESS OF EXPERIENCES IS NOT INTRINSIC BUT RELATIONAL In addition to providing phenomenal concepts, the what-it-is-like of experiences is associated with their aboutness or intentionality. The association between experiences is mediated through different mech anisms that are essential to correct for the implicit falsification of the information internalized by most experiences. The aboutness, as the experiences themselves, consists in experiences or signals that refer to the internal or external environment. This is to say that aboutness consists in the establishment of a relationship between experiences. For example, in the presence of a novel odor, we can not identify its origin. We need either additional experiences that provide its aboutness or a verbal explanation from somebody who already knows. Most endogenous qualitative experiences produce a desire or intention to act that is provided usually through an association with a previous experience. For example, thirst produces the desire to drink water, even if the subject does not understand the nature of dehydration. Animals implicitly learn that an uncomfortable sui generis feeling produced by a subjective signal can be eliminated by the appropriate action. What is biologically relevant is to respond to the aboutness associated with the original experience. The empir ical association between an experience and its aboutness is obvi ously sufficient for survival under natural conditions, even if it is not enough for true understanding. The what-it-is-like and the what-it-is-about produced by addi tional experiences is not the objective what-it-is, which cannot be understood by animals and most humans. This is because the nature</page><page sequence="27">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 451 of the objective can only be understood through propositional knowledge. Thus, the aboutness relates the experience to what is biologically advantageous or perceptually meaningful. Therefore, the aboutness of experiences is not intrinsic, but implicitly associated to them through at least three different mechanisms, which I use to classify aboutness in three kinds of relational associations. We can distinguish innate aboutness and phenomenal aboutness, which are common to all animals. The third kind of association, propositional aboutness is exclusively human and complements most of our expe riences, regardless their origin. The innate aboutness of some experiences is hard-wired and is characteristic of some instinctual reactions, which may not be nec essarily conscious. Encountering a fear object such as a snake is an example of a primary inducer of fear (Bechara et al. 2003). Rats and humans are both frightened by the sight of snakes. Simi larly, infants and newly born mammal are hard-wired to suckle, and some baby birds have an instinctive reaction to hide or escape at the view of predators (Damasio 1999). Laboratory-reared rats also will either freeze or try to escape in the presence of a cat, even if they have never seen one before (Blanchard and Blanchard 1989; LeDoux 1996). These are all prime examples of innate aboutness or instinctual reactions. Phenomenal aboutness is established through experiences and its value resides in having a language independent capacity to refer. Phenomenal aboutness is the most basic mechanism that animals have to make intelligent choices. With the exception of a few expe riences that have innate aboutness, most do not have any pre determined semantic content until their aboutness is learned by association with other experiences. This is clearly true for animals, which in the absence of language use phenomenal aboutness to navigate the world. One of the best-studied examples of learned phenomenal aboutness is that of fear conditioning (LeDoux 1995, 1996). I previously proposed (Musacchio 2005) that the meaning of phenomenal experiences is an essential component of a vir tual language-independent phenomenal-intentional lexicon, in which the 'entries' are the what-it-is-like of experiences and their 'defi nitions' consist in their aboutness and in their indexical reference. Thus, the aboutness of phenomenal experiences is not intrinsic, but associated through additional experiences. As I indicated above, phe-red is a signal for obj-red, but its aboutness is variable under different circumstances, such as in red light, red fruit, red face.</page><page sequence="28">452 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO The lack of intrinsic aboutness of some experiences is also illus trated by some abnormal states, such as spontaneous anxiety, panic attacks and endogenous depression. Synesthesias are a special case, in which the relation between sensory inputs with the corresponding experiences is altered, perhaps through changes in their normal wir ing (Ramachandran and Hubbard 2001a, b). Phenomenal aboutness relies on relating the what-it-is-like of an experience with the phenomenal concept of another experience. Thus, aboutness corrects the lack of intrinsic meaning of most expe riences. The aboutness of experiences is learned implicitly by ani mals, as in classical and instrumental conditioning. The bell ringing before the meals meant for Pavlov's dogs that food is coming, so they start secreting gastric juice. For Skinner's rats, the view of the lever means that they can get food by pressing it. Besides, domestic animals readily show their understanding when we start to prepare their food. Propositional aboutness is characteristically human and is established through verbal explanations. Moreover, the phenomenal aboutness of any experience can be supplemented to include knowledge obtained through the third person perspective. For example, in addition to knowing through their phenomenal aboutness, tomatoes are gener ally considered healthy because they contain vitamin C, potassium and lycopene. Neural analogues in the appropriate brain areas are the only entities that can be incorporated into qualitative experiences. Propositions can be associated with experiences, but they cannot be fed into the brain areas in which the sensory neural analogues take place (as discussed for the explanatory gap in Musacchio (2002)). The what-it-is-like and the what-it-is-about are cognitive signals that allow for intelligent choices and integrated responses. This is true even if experiences are contingent, falsify reality and we do not know exactly how they are realized. However, the integration of the neu roscience perspective into philosophical discourse allows us to con clude that phenomenal concepts and their aboutness are instrumental in determining behavior. The capacity of choosing the right alternatives fosters the development of higher intelligence, because the most intel ligent individuals are the most likely to succeed and to leave descen dants. It also makes possible the development of signals, language and other symbolic forms, opening the doors for higher forms of knowl edge.</page><page sequence="29">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 453 6. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The answer to our question, "Why do qualia and the mind seem nonphysical?," is complex because most details about how qualitative experiences and the mind are realized remain unanswered. However, despite the incompleteness of our knowledge, the physical nature of the processes underlying the mint has been established not only by studying the devastating effects of diseases, but also by biochemical, neurophysiological and surgical interventions on the brain. More over, modern neuroimaging studies of the functional brain leave no doubt about the identity of brain and mind. However, despite the unmistakable answer from the neuroscientific perspective, there are many confounding factors that we analyzed above in determining reasons for the pervasive illusion that the mind is nonphysical. One is our tendency to reify abstractions into nonphysical entities of dubious ontology. Another is the fragmentation of culture into dis ciplines that claim their own independence and block the unification of knowledge. Unfortunately, I could not discuss these two factors here. However, the most important factor in conflating the nature of qualia and the mind is due to the transparency of experiences. Transparency helps to explain not only the biological role of experi ences, but also some of their puzzling characteristics. Transparency, in the sense of the imperceptibility of the intrinsic mechanisms of experiences, is produced by the lack of sensors that sense the brain itself. This avoids the regress implied in sensing the sensors ad infi nitum, but it creates the pervasive illusion that the mind is non physical. This implies that phenomenology, the view from the first person perspective, cannot be trusted as a philosophical method, because the what-it-is-like provided by experiences is not identical to the what-it-is. Qualitative experiences internalize information with a degree of isomorphism that varies according to the different senses. Besides, the qualitative experiences generated by organic needs are cogni tive signals with practically no isomorphic content. Their biologi cal value critically depends on the establishment of their aboutness, established either through innate or learned associations. All this implies that the cognitive limitations of the subjective perspective must be supplemented by the empirical knowledge provided by sci ence. Qualia are language-independent cognitive shortcuts that act like easily interpretable signals for their associated aboutness.</page><page sequence="30">454 JOSE M. MUSACCHIO Sensing the external world and knowing about food and pre dators are the cognitive abilities that make possible the survival of animals and humans as complex organisms. Sensory informa tion is internalized as contingent physical transforms with differ ent degrees of isomorphism, which I have called neural surrogates. The existence of internal images is untenable because they imply homunculi and regress. Besides, images are not useful metaphors to describe the poorly isomorphic quality of most experiences that refer to organic needs. Since nothing can be internalized as what it-is, the internalized information and its aboutness must be inter preted as the reality itself. The neural surrogates act as de facto identities of the properties and objects of the external world. Thus, even if the neural surrogates are only partially isomorphic to the ele ments of the external world, they are physical transforms that consti tute the most basic way to internalize information about the world. When they are integrated into conscious experiences, they become qualitative experiences that create the surrogate reality in which we live. The view from neuroscience indicates that phenomenal knowl edge is clearly the result of biological processes, with intrinsic fea tures that are not cognoscible through the subjective first person perspective. Organisms that could know rapidly and efficiently about their surroundings would have an edge on survival. Thus, 'use ful' mutations have better chances of being transmitted to the next generation. Sensing the environment and internalizing the result ing information in a language-independent fashion are an absolute prerequisite for developing propositional knowledge and the capac ity to reason. The problem of internalizing information through the senses has been solved practically and expediently by Nature with the development of qualitative experiences. To understand qua lia, we must be aware of the biology of our senses and cognition. There are some facts that are not evident to the first person per spective and that should be taken into account to understand sens ing. We - our brain - can only internalize nerve action potentials produced by the senses, so we do not have a direct way to experi ence what we call reality or the external world. Sensing is contin gent to random genetic mutations and to the evolutionary pressures imposed by the environment. This suggests that we perceive only signals, which even if they are reliable physical transformations, are unrecognizable as such because they do not have any intrinsic mean ing or aboutness.</page><page sequence="31">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 455 The general concept of neural surrogates has considerable explan atory power, because it can account for the existence of 'unfelt pains', unattended sensations, unconscious processes and automatic responses to sensory input that produce a response even before the organism consciously perceives the stimulus. When the neural surrogates are incorporated into conscious processes, they account for normal experiences, dreams, illusions, hallucinations, phantom pains, etc. In addition, the physicality of neural surrogates dissolves the problem of the 'mental' causation. Qualia have some apparently perplexing properties, such as their ineffability, which consists in the impossibility of explaining the 'what-it-is-like' of an experience to a person who never had such experience. This can be easily understood if we realize that qualita tive experiences are contingent processes that cannot be duplicated through the symbolism of propositional language. The transforma tion of complex details into qualitative experiences is an expedient, language independent way to decrease the amount of information internalized. Qualia actually falsify reality, so they must be associ ated to their aboutness through additional experiences that provide their meaning. Thus, the aboutness of experiences is not intrinsic but relational, because it consists in the establishment of a relation ship between experiences. The downside of simplicity and the price that we pay for their efficiency is that through introspection, we can not perceive their physical nature. NOTES 1 Rey (1998) and Lycan (1996) also use equivalent notations. 2 I have recently reviewed the transparency of experience (Musacchio 2002). See also Block and Stalnaker (1999); Dennett (1991), Jakab (2000), Metzinger (1995), Papineau (1995, 2002), Tye (2000), Martin (2002) and Chalmers (1996). 3 I found inspiration in the work of Papineau (2002). However, I do not think that the illusion of the nonphysical nature of the mind is derived from our aver sion to new ideas, as the term antipathetic fallacy (Papineau 1995) implies. 4 For additional discussion see Block (2002), Churchland (1986, 2002, 1995), Bickle (1998, 2003), Kim (1996, 1998), Kandel and Squire (2000) and Taylor (2002). 5 I cannot discuss the subject here, but I think that reason and logic are patterns implicitly abstracted from the structure and processes that characterize the physi cal world. I imagine that abstracting reason and logic from the physical world is a process similar to the implicit learning of artificial grammars, as described by Reber (1993). I think that it is not by mere coincidence that all natural processes are logically structured, reasonable and explainable. The bases for these ideas can</page><page sequence="32">456 JOS? M. MUSACCHIO be found in the writings of Jean Piaget and his followers. See also the following footnote on the implicit forms of learning. 6 In addition to phenomenal and propositional knowledge (Musacchio 2002), the unconscious or implicit forms of learning (Reber 1993) should not be ignored, because they are essential for learning (even in the absence of language) natu ral, behavioral and cultural patterns, categories, temporal and causal relationships, etc. 7 The nervous system is thought to employ a combinatorial system to encode information. Colors are though to be encoded as distinct patterns of activa tion across three dimensions in by a virtual 'cube' red-green, yellow-blue and black-white opponent cells. P. Churchland believes that tastes, smells, faces, etc. are encoded in similar vector spaces (Churchland 1995). This hypothesis is based on the finding that artificial neuronal networks can be trained to recognize sim ilar patterns (Bickle and Mandik 2002). 8 For expediency, I reluctantly use teleological metaphors because our language is permeated by anthropomorphism. However, I believe that Nature has no pur poses. All extant organisms have biological traits that allowed them to survive competition; otherwise, they would not be here. Thus, the features of most organ isms can be described in teleological terms as 'successful'. However, countless numbers of species have succumbed to the changes in the physical and biologi cal environment, clearly indicating that survival is an anthropomorphic value that we project into Nature. Thus, for the sake of simplifying expressions, the prop erties of biological systems can be described using metaphors with teleological and anthropomorphic implications, but without actually implying that this is the case. This does not negate that we can find purposes and develop a moral code of behavior that we consider essential for living in a society where cooperation and leadership are crucial for surviving as a group. 9 The problem of mental causation is discussed in Block (2002), Hardcastle (1998), Kim (1998), Papineau (2002), Velmans (2002) and many others. 10 The anthropomorphism of our terminology is so ingrained in our language, that it is difficult to find common words that do not imply any regress. The best option is to use technical descriptions of the neurobiological processes that have been obtained through the third person perspective. However, the task is not easy because words that refer to phenomenal experiences are ineffable (Musacchio 2005). 11 Additional information and references can be found in Bauer (2004), Block (2005), Coenen (1998), Koch (2004), Llin?s et al. (1998), Moruzzi and Magoun (1949), Musacchio (2002), Newman (1995) and Steriade et al. (1996). 12 The complexity of the visual system is enormous and cannot be summarized in the space available. For additional information, the reader should consult Zeki (1993) or Kandel et al. (2000). 13 The self, any conscious being, or I cannot be different from the functioning brain in which those processes take place. This is to say that the self is one of the functions of the brain. It is incorrect to say, "I have a brain". Instead, I should say, T am the current state of what I call my brain'. One of the problems is that language reflects the bias of the first person perspective, which cannot per ceive the physicality of the conglomerate of functions and states that we are. The self is perhaps the most complex function of the brain. Occasionally, we adopt</page><page sequence="33">WHY DO QUALIA AND THE MIND SEEM NONPHYSICAL? 457 a dissociative (or schizoid) way of referring to 'our brain', as if it were not part of our own self or as if our own brain did not have anything to do with the genesis of my experiences and my thoughts. I can lose a limb, but not a chunk of my brain, and still continue to be myself. My experiences and my thoughts are the physical processes that take place in the brain that I am.
