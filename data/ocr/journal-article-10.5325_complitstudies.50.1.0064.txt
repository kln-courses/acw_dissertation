      <p>Ecocritical approaches in Latin Americanist literary and cultural studies (carried out in Latin America, the United States, or Europe) owe considerably to the dissemination of environmental literatures in English and to the ecocritical approaches developed in academia for studying these literatures. The drift of ecocritical approaches from English departments to foreign literature and comparative literature departments is driven by the relevance of environmental concerns, the will to address them across the curriculum, and the fact that comparison helps us recognize differences and commonalities. This development in academia parallels the dissemination of environmental discourses across borders occurring in the environmental movements themselves. Let's take, for instance, a discourse that has been evolving in Latin America since the early 2000s and has been actively used by social movements: <italic>buen vivir</italic>.<sup>1</sup> “Buen vivir” or “vivir bien,” is a Spanish phrase that refers to indigenous-based alternatives to the negative impacts of economic development. The discourses of <italic>buen vivir</italic> focus on the good life in a broad sense, that is to say, the classical ideas of quality of life, but with the specific idea that well-being is only possible within a community. In most approaches, the concept of “community” is understood in an expanded sense that includes nature. <italic>Buen vivir</italic>, therefore, embraces the broad notion of well-being and cohabitation with others and nature. <italic>Buen vivir</italic> relies on values associated with indigenous traditions, and in this sense the concept explores possibilities beyond the modern Eurocentric tradition. On the other hand, it includes critical reactions to classical Western development theory that echo certain indigenous perspectives, for instance, radical environmental postures, particularly deep ecology and other biocentric approaches that reject the anthropocentric perspective of modernity and recognize intrinsic values in the environment. Another example would be the coincidence with feminist perspectives that link gender roles with societal hierarchies and the domination over nature. In spite of its historical emphasis on the local, environmentalism is a transnational phenomenon, politically and culturally, following and responding to processes of globalization and increasingly focusing on planetary issues.<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Today, in the global North, ecocriticism is demanding from its practitioners an understanding of developments beyond their borders, as well as a cross-cultural sensitivity, ethics, and politics. In the global South, and certainly in Latin America, I argue, it is precisely the responsibility of literary and cultural studies to be at the frontline of this kind of research. Among the pending tasks in Hispanic studies are the study of canonical authors and texts from ecological perspectives and the expansion of that canon. On the other hand, environmental or ecological readings of Latin American literatures and cultures will benefit from a comparison with other literatures from the global South, and vice versa, since they have similar environmental problems, struggles, and histories. The current pattern in Hispanic studies of not engaging enough with the reflection on the relationship between society and nature and the human and the nonhuman in the history of Latin American literature and the arts projects the false image to our students, South and North, that these topics have been totally secondary in this tradition and that literature and the arts have nothing to say regarding current environmental issues and conflicts in the region.</p>
      <p>This article contributes to the achievement of these goals with a reading of <italic>El zorro de arriba y el zorro de abajo</italic> (1971) (<italic>The Fox from Up Above and the Fox from Down Below</italic> [2000]) by Peruvian writer José María Arguedas (1911–1969). <italic>Los zorros</italic> (<italic>The Foxes</italic>), Arguedas's last, posthumous, and allegedly unfinished novel, explores major transformations in Peruvian Andean culture under the stress of migration in the 1960s. The novel also records Arguedas's own existential crisis that led him to commit suicide. Arguedas was one of the most influential Latin American writers of the twentieth century. Since his death, he has become an emblematic figure in theories of Latin American cultural identity based on the idea of transculturation, <italic>mestizaje</italic>, or hybridity. Arguedas's appeal owes to his forceful understanding of Peruvian cultural identity as the product of the conflicting but creative encounter of Andean, oral, traditional, and rural cultures, on the one hand, with Western, Christian, written, modern, urban and cosmopolitan cultures, on the other. For more than thirty years, Arguedas constantly rethought his profound critique of economic and cultural modernization and practiced through his literature a convinced self-conscious alternative adaptation to modernization rooted in Andean traditions. His importance can be measured too by the attention he receives from his rivals, for instance, from Nobel Laureate novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, also a Peruvian. In <italic>La utopía arcaica: José María Arguedas y las ficciones del indigenismo</italic> (2004), Vargas Llosa, despite his admiration for Arguedas, elaborates again on an argument he has made in several occasions throughout his own career: Arguedas and the history of Peruvian <italic>indigenismo</italic> fell into the trap of yearning for a nostalgic “return” to idealized premodern conditions.</p>
      <p>In this article, I argue that there is in <italic>Los zorros</italic> an emerging ecological thinking that surges ironically from the limitations of ecologies that are portrayed in the book as “Andean” or “provincial” (in the sense of “small town” and “unsophisticated”) ecologies that are overwhelmed by a major environmental crisis in the city of Chimbote, on the Peruvian coast. A massive number of people from the Andean highlands had poured into Chimbote, a former fishing town, lured by the expectation of job opportunities in the largest steel mill in the country but especially in the fish meal industry that had made of Chimbote the largest fishing port of the world. What has been omitted so far in interpretations of Arguedas's last novel is his attention to the ecological crisis brought about in Chimbote by resource-destructive economic and technological processes and to how this ecological disruption is coextensive with damage to the social fabric and psychological life of the immigrants. Intercalated in between the chapters, in sections entitled “Diarios” (“Diaries”), <italic>Los zorros</italic> also tells the story of the psychological breakdown of the subject that introduces himself as the author of the novel and that identifies himself as José María Arguedas, although the accuracy of these autobiographical sections has been much debated.<sup>3</sup> “Arguedas's” reflections in the diary sections are mostly devoted to his own struggle to understand and accept the transformations in Chimbote (which may presage what lies ahead for Peruvian society) and to find the strength to write down this town's story in an appropriate fashion. As the story manages to be told, “Arguedas” becomes aware of the challenges Chimbote poses to his overall vision of the role of Andean culture in an alternative version of a modern and more democratic Peruvian society. Furthermore, Chimbote likewise challenges his past poetics of literary creation based on a sense of belonging to the universe. In order to narrate Chimbote, “Arguedas” will have to find a way of reworking his lost connection with all things.</p>

         </title>
         <p>
            <italic>Los zorros</italic> is set in Chimbote, a boomtown on the Peruvian coast that within a decade had gone from being a sleepy fishing village to an industrializing yet poor city. Chimbote is overcrowded with Andean immigrants working in steel mills, in the numerous fleets of commercial fishing boats extracting anchoveta (a fish of the anchovy family), or in the busy factories where this catch is processed into fish meal for exportation (fish meal is ground dried fish used as a fertilizer and as feed for domestic livestock; from the late 1940s on, it was in great demand worldwide). The narrative focuses on the evidence of a devastating environmental crisis whose effects are part of the already traumatic experience of the Andean immigrants in Chimbote:
<disp-quote>
               <p xml:lang="es">La fetidez del mar desplazaba el olor denso del humo de las calderas en que millones de anchovetas se desarticulaban, se fundían, exhalaban ese olor como alimenticio, mientras hervían y sudaban aceite. El olor de los desperdicios, de la sangre, de las pequeñas entrañas pisoteadas en las bolicheras y lanzadas sobre el mar a manguerazos, y el olor del agua que borbotaba de las fábricas a las playas hacía brotar de la arena gusanos gelatinosos; esa fetidez avanzaba a ras del suelo y elevándose.

               <p>(The stench of the sea displaced the reek of the smoke from the boiler in which millions of anchovies were coming apart, melting, exhaling that rather foodlike odor as they were boiling and sweating oil. The dense odor of the waste matter, of blood, of the tiny entrails trampled in the trawlers and hosed out over the sea, and the smell of the water that gushed out of the factories on to the beach made jellylike worms rise up out of the sand; that stench kept drifting along at a ground level and rising. [43])<sup>4</sup>

         </p>
         <p>One can gather from similar descriptions throughout the novel a story of environmental degradation that is never addressed as such either by the narrative voice or by any of its characters. For starters, the novel makes reference to the fact that the number of anchoveta on the Peruvian coastline had been declining due to years of overfishing; in the novel, the anchoveta are disappearing from Chimbote's bay, and the fishing boats need to search for them in the open sea. Furthermore, this violent industrial extraction and processing of natural resources is leading to other species' extinction. Closer to the immigrants' daily life, the Chimbote bay, the surrounding desert, and the city's air and streets are being virulently polluted by the fish meal industry's waste. To make things worse, potable water, sewage, and trash collection is not provided by the town. And, finally, the apparently disorganized urbanization of the land surrounding the city by the immigrants is destroying the few wetlands in the area. One thing is clear though in the narrative: the violence against nonhuman actors partakes of the exploitation perpetrated against poor, gendered, and racialized human subjects. In every aspect, the fish meal industry is an unregulated activity, defiant of national and local authorities, encouraged by its weight in the gross national product. In the novel, the entry point for a social exploration of the industry's political economy is its labor practices. Attracted by the news of good jobs and free land for building their own houses that was spread north and south by a “mafia” working for the industrialists, indigenous peoples, mestizos, blacks, mulattos, descendants of Chinese immigrants, poor Spaniards, and Italians all arrived into Chimbote from every Andean town, from other coastal cities, and even from the Amazon in eastern Peru. And they keep on coming even after the labor market in Chimbote has substantially shrunk. The excessive supply of workers guarantees low wages for everybody, undermines job stability, and keeps the unions under the control of the industry. Moreover, this unstoppable migration exacerbates conflicts between the newly arrived and previous waves of immigrants and between members of different races and ethnicities.</p>
         <p>We can approach retrospectively the ecological crisis depicted in <italic>Los zorros</italic> by drawing on current thinking about urban sustainability. Chimbote's ecosystems (sea and desert) and ecotones (coastline and marshes) were made party to, one way or another, the consumption and investment choices of industries in distant, richer cities in the first world. Chimbote itself had all the common environmental problems affecting poor and industrializing cities: poor air quality, industrial pollution of water, no system for managing solid and hazardous wastes, no sewage treatment, lack of efficient public health and sanitation policies, deficient urban transport, insufficient housing for recent migrants, no protection from criminals, and so forth.<sup>5</sup> In spite of the fact that Chimbote was the site of a significant source of wealth, there was no planning or capital to develop a very much needed and expected urban infrastructure. Despite the fact that income had grown in this export-oriented economy, the financing of public works depended on resources controlled mostly by an indifferent national government.</p>
         <p>In addition to providing an exposé of the environmental degradation taking place in Chimbote, the novels also pays attention to the actions and attitudes through which the immigrant characters experience and interpret in Chimbote their sense of embeddedness in nature. In the midst of a most violent depletion of natural resources, a maze of corruption and mistrust, and an apparent resignation to air and land pollution, a few Andean migrants often resort to performing traditional songs and narratives. Through these performances, the immigrants are not only reaffirming their identity on the streets of Chimbote and its shantytowns but are also trying to cope with the indefatigable boats, the polluting factories, and the much frequented brothels spreading on the dunes surrounding Chimbote. Most of the time, these performances evoke the wildlife and pristine environments of the high-altitude <italic>cordilleras</italic>:

[78])</p>
            </disp-quote>
In addition to the idealization of wilderness, pastoral nostalgia also plays an important role among the immigrants. Of course, in this novel the pastoral is not an idealization of rural life by an urban, middle-class, white, or Western subject but a crucial site of trauma and memory for the rural Andean immigrant. Far from naïve idealizing rural life by hiding the hardships of it, the immigrants recall too the unfair political ecology in the Andes that has driven them out of the mountains into the coastal cities, away from the oppressive medieval conditions on the haciendas in the countryside. This lack of economic and political opportunities has landed the Andean immigrants on deserts of which they have very little environmental knowledge.</p>
         <p>In <italic>Los zorros</italic>, the immigrant subjects have become aware of the need to understand their individual and collective identity in relation to a diversity of places and place experiences, not merely in relation to the place of origin or of current dwelling. Any form of place attachment known to the immigrants is challenged in Chimbote because of the uniqueness of its environmental crisis and social tensions, as well as because behind every immigrant there is often a story of successive migrations throughout Peru. The story of Don Esteban de la Cruz, one of the main characters, is a micronarrative of these displacements. After his father was killed in a family dispute, Esteban's stepmother left the countryside town of Parobamba for the city, taking with her Esteban's half brother. She put Esteban on the road and sent him to a relative's farm. Esteban was just eight or ten years old at that time. A couple of years later, Esteban and one of his cousins escaped from the farm and migrated to the foothills of the Andes, where the tropical forest starts. There, they worked in a coca plantation under such extreme conditions that they end up running away once more. After working on a highway for a year, they both migrated to Lima, Peru's capital, where Esteban survived working in all sorts of odd jobs but was unable to secure a place to live. One way or another, after living in other cities, Esteban found himself back near Parobamba working long days in the coal mine of Cocalón, from which he was eventually fired for fighting with another miner. From there, he moved to Chimbote, where he and his wife at last built a house, in a reed bed in a water-logged depression infested with mosquitos. Now a middle-aged man, battling the lung disease that he contracted in the mine, Esteban is angry about all the exploitation he suffered and witnessed throughout his life and about the effects that migration has on the immigrants' identity and sense of dignity. The Andean peasants cannot make a living working their small farms, nor can they accept the working conditions in the haciendas. Rootless in the cities, they longed for their hometowns and their youth:

[157–58])</p>
            </disp-quote>
There is no room in Chimbote for the kind of sense of place that, according to Ursula Heise in her <italic>Sense of Place and Sense of Planet</italic>, has developed in American environmentalism. The immigrant in Chimbote is not compelled by an ethic of proximity, allegedly the basic prerequisite for an environmental awareness and activism. In Chimbote, the immigrants have no history of merging their bodies with the natural environment other than through their part in the exploitation of anchoveta, the polluted air they breathe daily, and their dead relatives populating the halfway built cemeteries.</p>
         <p>Undoubtedly, the knowledge and values supporting the narrative's eye for recognizing pollution, degradation, and environmental injustice in Chimbote derives from Arguedas's understanding of Andean cultures. The ecological values portrayed as “Andean” in the novel indeed feed some resistance among a few characters, but overall fall they short of developing alternatives to effectively manage the environmental impact of the fish meal industry and the uneven development that it produces. They fall short too of even inspiring better environmental practices among the immigrants themselves. In fact, the majority of the immigrants working for the fish meal industry, despite their cultural background, actively and willingly participate in the environmental degradation that they themselves call a “rape” of nature. “Ese, qu'está a tu lado, va'olvidar aquí el ojete, porque la mar es la más grande concha chupadora de mundo. La concha exige pincho, ¿no es cierto, Mudo?” (26) (“Out here that guy next to ya is gonna forget all about assholes, because the ocean is the greatest suckin' cunt in the world. The cunt demands a cock, right Mudo?” [27]). Male immigrants above all commit to the challenges that the Western and modern industry dare them to take on. They have become accomplices to a sexist “conquest of nature” that is driven not only by the immigrants' need to survive but by their desire to “conquer” a taunting Western industrial modernization. Industrial labor makes men, brag the former peasants now transformed into fishermen or factory workers. Even resisting capitalist exploitation is a manly affair. Both of these, meeting the challenges of development or resisting transnational capitalism, foster nationalism.<sup>6</sup> And so, the immigrant men succumb to the lure of the city and its excesses. The brothels at the border between the city and the desert, where the story often takes place, are a microcosmos of Chimbote and of Peru.</p>
         <p>The immigrants are not interested in or else are unable to reproduce or adapt traditional social relations for community building in Chimbote or to develop a non-modern, non-Western, or more than modern or more than Western, relationship with the landscape. Owing to ethnic and class conflicts among immigrants, widespread corruption among politicians and unions; the high expectation that economic modernization would offer the immigrants social mobility, and ideological uncertainty within the Marxist Left, “Andean” ecologies retreat to the background, almost as an environmental unconscious. As defined by literary critic Lawrence Buell, the concept of an environmental unconscious refers “to the necessarily partial realization of one's embeddedness in environment as a condition of personal and social being” and “implies both the potentiality for a fuller coming-to-consciousness and a limit to that potentiality.”<sup>7</sup> This predicament of Arguedas's “Andean” ecologies extends to the scholarship on Arguedas. The limitations of an “Andean” ecology in <italic>Los zorros</italic> should compel those readers who celebrate a non-Western ecological thinking for its resistance to colonialism in Arguedas's <italic>Los ríos profundos</italic> (1958) (<italic>Deep Rivers</italic> [1978]), his most popular novel, to question it. Indeed, in that novel Arguedas on the one hand links the exploitation of indigenous peoples by a class of Catholic landowners to the cruelty against nature perpetrated by those landowners.<sup>8</sup> On the other hand, Arguedas links indigenous political strength and harmony with nature to the independent communities of the Andean highlands, the same landscapes evoked by the immigrants in Chimbote. The predicament of Arguedas's “Andean” ecologies is such that although the best critics of his work at the time were discovering and embracing environmentalism, they did not acknowledge Arguedas as the source of their interest in ecology. One of the most important scholars on Arguedas and on Latin American cultural studies in the second half of the twentieth century, the Uruguayan critic Angel Rama, missed the opportunity to introduce Arguedas's work as an incursion into the same ecological terrain that was catching his own attention, as recorded in his personal diary, while he was writing his two influential books <italic>Transculturación narrativa en América Latina</italic> (1982), devoted to Arguedas, and <italic>La ciudad letrada</italic> (1984) (<italic>The Lettered City</italic> [1996]). On 10 September 1980, Rama wrote in his diary that

            </disp-quote>
Behind this missed opportunity is, without a doubt, the difficulty that Marxism in Latin America had in articulating, until recently, an environmentalist or ecological thinking. And this difficulty is portrayed within the novel itself.</p>
         <p>The emerging ecological thinking in <italic>Los zorros</italic>, consistent with the way Arguedas represents Chimbote's unpredictable complexity, posits a set of questions and problems that cannot be addressed satisfactorily just by resorting to the accepted discourses at that time. What are the progressive forces in Chimbote preoccupied with? There is a political polarization among the unions that doesn't immunize them from the corruption financed by the fish meal factories. And the characters that play the role of intellectual figures are absorbed in ideological polarizations that keep them cut off from each other. For instance, the radical American Catholic priests that embrace liberation theology are promoting the anticolonialism of dependency theory while they themselves are suspected of being agents of foreign imperialism (as are the evangelical churches in town). In one occasion, a young Peruvian teacher, firmed believer in development economics as a mean of social progress is invited to dinner by the liberation theology priests. Along the meal, he gets lectured by the prominent Padre Michael Cardozo on the importance of dependency theory for breaking up the cycle of underdevelopment. For Cardozo and the other priests, the city of Cuzco, the former capital of the Inca Empire and supposedly the soul of Andean culture, is the source of wisdom for breaking that dependency and for understanding humanity in general. As they are saying their goodbyes, the young man and an older priest watch from the front door of the house a column of smoke towering above the steel mill and casting a shadow over the eucalyptus forest planted by the corporation running the mill. The Peruvian teacher, trying to impress the priest, tells him:

            </disp-quote>
Father Federico responds with a caustic remark: “Vaya al Cuzco, así; en ese ánimo” (201) (“Go to Cuzco like that, in that state of mind” [212]).</p>
         <p>
            <italic>Los zorros</italic> calls for an urban environmentalism bound to but not bounded by Andean ideas on the interdependence of humans and nature. It is not a lack of environmental awareness that is undermining the response to the unsustainability of human and nonhuman life in Chimbote but rather a lack of social innovation necessary to developing alternatives to the indifference of capital, organized labor, and the national government. Would the immigrant residents, divided by ethnicities, class, and ideologies, be able to substitute community-organized labor for capital and supply some social and public services? In spite of their displacement, could these immigrant communities develop a bioregional approach that would take into account the fact the ecosystem services needed by Chimbote would be supported by a larger geographic region? Would an effective governance of the environmental challenges emerge from these specific historical circumstances? Despite these divisions and displacements, could the immigrants dig deeper into Andean traditions looking for such alternatives and for models on how to negotiate among themselves?</p>
         <p>The narrative depicts new forms of political organization that are emerging in the shantytowns surrounding Chimbote, where the poorest indigenous immigrants live, <italic>asociaciones de barriadas</italic> (shantytown associations), whose purpose is to improve the infrastructure of the shantytowns independently from unions, political parties, and factories. The novel follows one president of the <italic>barriada</italic> in particular, Bazalar the pork farmer, otherwise known as the “pig man.” On one occasion, the city hall, the police, and the parish priests order the shantytown dwellers to move their cemetery to some low-lying flatland north of the city center and the shantytowns, which is near the port of Chimbote's garbage dump. In the new location, however, the poor would be buried free of charge, at no cost to the parish, or the municipality. Nobody told the shantytown dwellers to transport their dead, who were already buried in the “old” cemetery, to the new cemetery. Nevertheless, they do so in an organized and disciplined fashion. Bazalar reaches out to the unions for support, but his contact expresses indifference toward and even contempt for the indigenous immigrants living in the dunes:

Bazalar and his <italic>asociación</italic> are taking steps to build a sense of home in the face of the discrimination of the local authorities and are asking another popular organization to help them.

         <p>The immigrants in Chimbote do not have the problem with the sense of place that Ursula Heise has noted, for instance, in American environmentalism, namely a failure to recognize the extent to which the local is constituted by the global; the immigrants cannot deny that local and even national identities rely on hybrid mixtures with other places and cultures, by real or imagined or mediated travel.<sup>10</sup> Don Diego, a strange character with the looks of a foreigner but the sensibility of Andean people, explains this condition to the director of the most important fish meal factory when he visits there:

Don Esteban de la Cruz, as well as many other characters in the novel, has become aware that Chimbote is a place connected to other places within or outside Peru. Life in Chimbote is the product of political, economic, technological, social, cultural, and ecological networks shaping daily routines. It is also a perfect example of “deterritorialization,” as summarized by Ursula Heise: the weakening of ties between culture and place or in the social process that shifts governance and authority to distant locations.<sup>11</sup> Everybody assumes without any doubt that transnational corporations are the real powers behind the local and national elites controlling the city and the country. This certainty can reach the level of paranoia, especially vis-à-vis the United States. The inhabitants of Chimbote have an ambiguous relationship with the several Americans living in the city and its shantytowns. There are seven nongovernmental organizations serving in the city. Five of them are American. Even Chimbote's bishop is an American. And then, there is Maxwell, who came with the Peace Corps and stays in the shantytowns and frequents the brothels. Of course, there is Father Michael Cardozo and his priests, whom Loco Moncada, the black madman that goes around the city “preaching” political truths, excoriates:

         <p>Chimbote thus emerges as a location in which the different problems introduced so far in the novel seem to fuse or grow together—the exploitation of migrant workers, the exploitation of natural resources, widespread pollution and environmental degradation, other signs of the environmental injustice common in poor industrializing cities of the global economy, cultural identity crises due to migration, an “Andean” ecology working as a sort of environmental unconscious repressed or ignored by the competing political and economic forces in Chimbote, lack of social innovation within the popular movements due to corruption and ideological polarization, and a transnational sense of place that reinforces the sense of rootlessness and the awareness of deterritorialization. <italic>Los zorros</italic> foregrounds what Byron Caminero-Santangelo tentatively calls a “socio-ecological unconscious.” The concept is a welcome improvement on Lawrence Buell's environmental unconscious. <italic>Los zorros</italic>, indeed, foregrounds “the often suppressed or simplified complex relationships among global capitalism, relations of power operating at different scales, processes of primitive accumulation, local ecosystems and their transformations, representations of identity, and violence.”<sup>12</sup> This is the ecological thinking surging out of the <italic>lloqlla</italic> that Arguedas is attempting to represent in <italic>Los zorros</italic>. The ecological thinking of <italic>Los zorros</italic> calls for a fuller coming-to-consciousness of the socio-ecological complexity suggested in the plot, even if it does not offer specific proposals. <italic>Los zorros</italic> is creating a <italic>public</italic>, in the political sense that Jane Bennett defines the term in her <italic>Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things</italic> (2010), supported by her reading of the American philosopher John Dewey. Attempts to create a public recur throughout the novel. Don Diego performs, for the factory's boss and the workers that gather around them, a story about the history of the fish meal industry, the migration, and the environmental degradation. The performer par excellence in <italic>Los zorros</italic> is the aforementioned Loco Moncada, who goes around the city and draws audiences in with his wild performances, or <italic>prédicas</italic>, proclaiming the truths behind Chimbote's politics. According to Bennett, the public in Dewey's <italic>The Public and Its Problems</italic> is a confederation of bodies that by a shared experience of harm over time coalesces into a problem.<sup>13</sup> The public does not preexist the problem but emerges in response to it. The problems in Chimbote are signs of a potential public who eventually may address them within a socio-ecological framework, as the discourses of <italic>buen vivir</italic> in fact do in contemporary Latin American politics. Like <italic>buen vivir</italic>, or Bruno Latour's <italic>Politics of Nature</italic> (2004), <italic>Los zorros</italic> presupposes that Chimbote is a collective of human and nonhuman elements, although the channels of communication between them are blocked:
<disp-quote>
               <p xml:lang="es">Y el último sermón de Moncada en el campo quemado, cubierto de esqueletos de ratas, del mercado de La Línea que la municipalidad manda arrasar con buldóseres. Allí el zambo hace el balance final de cómo ha visto, desde Chimbote, a los animales y a los hombres. Porque él es el único que ve en conjunto y en lo particular las naturalezas y destinos. (243)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>(And Moncada's final sermón on the scorched ground, covered with rat skeletons, of La Línea market, which the municipality has ordered razed by bulldozers.

            </disp-quote>
Thus, in the last diary section of the novel, “Arguedas” warns us that the book may push to the very limits the potentiality for a fuller coming-to-consciousness of the socio-ecological complexity that it would like to assert, if he can only find the way for narrating this <italic>lloqlla</italic>.</p>

         <title>Reworking a “Provincial” Ecology of Writing</title>
         <p>In <italic>Los zorros</italic>, particularly in the diary sections, Arguedas vindicates a discredited “provincial” perspective by identifying himself as a “provincial” writer who is less immersed in the urban world of the lettered men and more engaged in “being-in-the-more-than-human world”:
<disp-quote>
               <p xml:lang="es">Lo repito ahora, que soy provinciano de este mundo, que he aprendido menos de los libros que en las diferencias que hay, que he sentido y visto, entre un grillo y un alcalde quechua, entre un pescador del mar y un pescador del Titicaca, entre un oboe, un penacho de totora, la picadura de un piojo blanco y el penacho de la caña de azúcar.” (174)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>(I say—and I repeat it now—that I am one of the provincial people of this world, that I have learned less from books than from the differences that exist—differences I have felt and seen—between a cricket [a loquacious dandy] and a Quechua staff-bearing leader, between a deep-sea fisherman and one from Lake Titicaca, between an oboe, the plume of a <italic>totora</italic> reed, the bite of a white louse, and the feathery plume of the sugarcane. [183])</p>
            </disp-quote>
This “provincial” position, identity even, is not a retreat from cosmopolitanism but a decentering of the experience of the transnational networks in which our daily lives are immersed. It is also a site from which subjects have often reasonably posited their sense of belonging to collectivities beyond the human. In the diary sections, “Arguedas” attributes the virtues of the “provincial” condition to other Latin American intellectuals, especially Angel Rama, Nelson Osorio (a Chilean literary critic), and Roberto Parra (a Chilean musician). Nevertheless, it is precisely “Arguedas's” assumption of a collectivity of human subjects and nonhuman actants that he perceives the more cosmopolitan Latin American intellectuals hold against him: “¿En qué se diferencia Nelson, de ‘Gog’ y del inmenso pino que está en ese patio colonial arequipeño? Soy claro …, ¿un animalista, un aldeano incurable? Yo digo que hay mucho más de lo que hay en común, entre ellos, que las diferencias” (177) (“What makes Nelson different from the dog, Gog, and from the huge pine tree in that colonial courtyard in Arequipa? Am I, indeed, an animalist, an incurable villager? I say the things they have in common are much more numerous than their differences” [186–87]).</p>
         <p>An actant is something that acts or to which activity is granted by others. It implies no special intention or motivation. The nonhuman actant (an animal, a plant, or a thing) is neither an object nor a subject but an “intervener.” By virtue of location and timing, an actant makes a difference, makes things happen. <italic>Los zorros</italic>, and Arguedas's oeuvre in general, demonstrates a preference for trash and for “abject” species of animals and plants: pigs, insects, stray dogs, wild ducks, <italic>alcatraces</italic>, parasitical plants, and so forth. In the diary sections, “Arguedas” recalls the few moments of happiness he owes to them:
<disp-quote>
               <p xml:lang="es">En Obrajillo y San Miguel podré vivir unos días rascándole la cabeza a los chanchos mostrencos, conversando muy bien con los perros y hasta revolcándome en la tierra con alguno de esos perros chuscos que aceptan mi compañía hasta ese extremo. Muchas veces he conseguido jugar con los perros de los pueblos, como perro con perro. Y así la vida es más vida para uno. (8)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>(In Obrajillo and San Miguel I shall be able to live for a few days scratching the heads of the stray pigs, conversing quite well with dogs, and even rolling around on the ground with some of those mongrels who accept my company to that extreme. Many times I have managed to play with the dogs in the small towns, dog to dog. In that way life is more of a life for a person. [10])<sup>14</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
“Arguedas's” environmentalism owes, in his own words, to this provincial condition. In the “third diary section, “Arguedas” tells about his first encounter with another coastal city, Moquegua. He can't help but describe Moquegua in a way that implicitly contrasts it with Chimbote:
<disp-quote>
               <p xml:lang="es">El estilo moqueguano de las casas, altas, frescas por el espacio y por los materiales de que están hechas, fue creado y construido para proteger, animar y pacificar al hombre que habita el angostísimo valle ardiente, caldeado por el desierto de tierra ya enhiesta a esa altura de la yunga costeña. Pero el tipo de ambiciones, anhelos y empuje precipitadamente modernizado. (174)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>(The Moqueguan style of houses, high-ceilinged, cooled by their spaciousness and by the materials with which they are built, was created to protect, encourage, and pacify the man who dwells in that extremely narrow, burning valley, heated by the desert of land tilted on end at that latitude of the coastal <italic>yunga</italic>. But the type of ambitions, longings, and drive of men rushed headlong into modernization …” [184, ellipsis in original])</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Upon facing Chimbote, the subject in the diary sections grieves the loss of his metanarrative for Peru's history and future. Recollecting a past novel of his, <italic>Todas las sangres</italic> (1965), “Arguedas” reminds the reader of the fluvial metaphor with which that novel envisions the solution to the conflict between the millenary Andean world and the legacy of Spanish colonialism: “Y esa pelea aparece en la novela como ganada por el <italic>yawar mayu</italic>, el río sangriento, que así llamamos en quechua al primer repunte de los ríos que cargan los jugos formados en las cumbres y abismos por los insectos, el sol, la luna y la música” (79) (“And in the novel, that struggle appears to be won by the <italic>yawar mayu</italic>, the bloody river, for in Quechua that is what we call the first flash flood of the rivers that carry the juices developed on the mountaintops and in the abysses by insects, sun, moon, and music” [83]). Chimbote, however, is for “Arguedas” a whole new challenge and, like the Andean immigrants in that city, he is struggling with his interpretation of a reality that attracts and scares him at once using the tools he has used before: “Allí, en esa novela, vence el <italic>yawar mayu</italic> andino, y vence bien. Es mi propia victoria. Pero ahora no puedo empalmar el capítulo III de la nueva novela, porque me enardece pero no entiendo a fondo lo que está pasando en Chimbote y en el mundo” (79) (“There, in that novel, the Andean <italic>yawar mayu</italic> conquers, and it conquers completely. It is my own victory. But now I cannot fit in chapter III of the new novel because although I'm eager to do it, I do not have a profound understanding of what's happening in Chimbote and in the world” [83]).</p>
         <p>In the very opening page of the novel, “Arguedas” claims that his writing is only possible under a strong sense of interconnectedness with the more than human and that his goal is to charge language with the nature of being and existence of things. However, that link to the world was lost or seriously weakened after 1944, when he became mentally ill. “Arguedas” couldn't write for almost five years. All of a sudden, his sense of connection to the world came back, according to a diary entry from April 1966, when he encountered a prostitute: “El encuentro con aquella alegre mujer debió ser el toque sutil, complejísimo que mi cuerpo y alma necesitaban, para recuperar el roto vínculo con todas las cosas. Cuando ese vínculo se hacía intenso podía trasmitir a la palabra la materia de las cosas” (7) (“The encounter with that joyful woman must have been just the subtle and very complex touch my body and soul needed in order to reforge the broken link with all things. Once that link was strengthened, I was able to put the substance of things into words” [9]). Occasionally, while writing <italic>Los zorros</italic>, that lost connection returned thanks to some very special nonhuman actants. In an very different environment from that of Chimbote, the colonial city of Arequipa, “Arguedas” manages to finish the last fifteen pages of chapter 3 supported by his exchanges with a tree, which, like all trees in the Andes, is solitary:
<disp-quote>
               <p xml:lang="es">El pino de ciento veinte metros de altura que está en el patio de la Casa Reisser y Curioni, y que domina todos los horizontes de esta ciudad intensa que se defiende contra la agresión del cemento feo, no del buen cemento; ese pino llegó a ser mi mejor amigo…. Le hablé con respeto…. Oía su voz, que es la más profunda y cargada de sentido que nunca he escuchado en ninguna otra cosa ni en ninguna otra parte. (175)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>(The 120-meter-tall pine tree in the courtyard of the Casa Reisser y Curioni, which dominates all the horizons of this intense city that is defending itself against the aggression of ugly concrete—not of the good concrete—that pine tree came to be my best friend…. I spoke to him respectfully…. I kept hearing his voice, which is the deepest, the most meaningful I have ever heard in any other thing or in any other place. [184])</p>
            </disp-quote>
In “Arguedas's” “provincial” ecology of writing, the underlying paradigm for his aesthetics is the performance of music, dancing, even storytelling—indeed, any form of embodied expression and knowledge performed by humans or nonhumans:
<disp-quote>
               <p xml:lang="es">La palabra, pues, tiene que desmenuzar el mundo. El canto de los patos negros que nadan en los lagos de altura, helados, donde se empoza la nieve derretida, ese canto repercute en los abismos de roca, se hunde en ellos; se arrastra en las punas, hace bailar a las flores de las yerbas duras que se esconden bajo el <italic>ichu</italic>, ¿no es cierto? … La palabra es más precisa y por eso puede confundir. El canto del pato de altura nos hace entender todo el ánimo del mundo. (49)</p>
            </disp-quote>
            <disp-quote>
               <p>(Well, then, the word must shatter the world. The song of the black ducks that swim in icy highland lakes where melted snow is collected—that song re-echoes from the rocky abysses, and sinks down into them; it's swept over the bleak high country, making the flowers of the tough herbs hidden under the <italic>ichu</italic> dance, right? … The word is more precise, and that's why it can be confusing. The highland duck's song makes the whole spirit of the world understandable to us. [52–53])</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Despite of these intermittent returns to his poetics of the past, “Arguedas” is pursuing new challenges that he has to meet under difficult conditions: a sense of disjunction with the world and disillusion regarding the lasting validity of his metanarrative for Peruvian history. The final diary section puts forward the proposition that the ideological confusion and confrontation in Chimbote are “hervores” (“concoctions”) in which some new political action is brewing. In fact, in this section he introduces a few of them under the disguise of unfinished parts of the novel. These “hervores” are not deliberations producing responses to any given problem but, and borrowing Jane Bennett's language, “the ‘fermentation’ of the various propositions and energies of the affected bodies.”<sup>15</sup> In <italic>Los zorros</italic> a nonteleological narrative logic emerges out of the display of the limitations of his previous narratives. This is a narrative logic more interested in stressing the becoming and survival strategies of bodies and capacities in the face of obstacles or problems. It may be articulated in terms of Elizabeth Grosz's take on Darwin's narrative of evolution.<sup>16</sup> The hotbed that Chimbote is, and its emblematic value as Peru's possible future in the late 1960s, points to the idea that <bold>t</bold>he future must be connected, genealogically related, to what exists, but is capable of many possible variations. The future follows directions latent or virtual in but not necessarily actualized by the present. The new is the generation of a productive monstrosity, the deformation and transformation of prevailing models and norms, so that what has been unrecognized in the past and present, as well as what deformations the present can sustain, will elaborate themselves in the future. <italic>Los zorros</italic>, indeed, disrupts radically what people can “see” according to the very ideologies that dominate the political discussion in Chimbote. <italic>Los zorros</italic> offers us a Chimbote impelled forward to a future that is unknowable and relatively uncontained by the past. Within this narrative logic, <italic>Los zorros</italic> has no choice but to turn its back to the essentialist and teleological <italic>yawar mayu</italic> as a means of representing Chimbote. It resorts to the monstrosity of the <italic>lloqlla</italic> for representing the deformation of past and present models in Chimbote and, therefore, the unknowable nature of its future. This narrative logic includes an open-ended understanding of the intermingling of human and nonhuman history in particular.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>
            <italic>Los zorros</italic> is crucial for recognizing the still overlooked approaches to the environment in Latin American literature that emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in parallel with the rise of the environmental movement in the United States (Rachel Carson's <italic>Silent Spring</italic> was published in 1962, and the first Earth Day was held in 1970) and during a time when environmentalism was perceived as something introduced into Latin America from the outside and from above (<italic>The Limits of Growth</italic> was published in 1972 by the Club of Rome). <italic>Los zorros</italic> anticipates by two decades, for instance, the rise of the environmental justice movement in the United States, as well as the critique of the romantic idea—when dogmatically asserted—that non-Western or nonindustrial peoples possess an “ecological wisdom.” It anticipates too by thirty years the current theorization on the environmentalism of the poor and postcolonial ecocriticism in the global South. <italic>Los zorros</italic> is a representative of a literary corpus published prior to Rio de Janeiro 1992 that so far has been missed by literary scholars and environmental thinkers alike in spite of the fact that it was responding already to the impact on local ecologies of both the emerging free market policies and free trade policies of neoliberalism and the indifference of Marxist revolutionary politics to environmental issues.</p>
         <p>Popular environmentalisms have been the subject of a significant number of documentaries released within the last decade and can be explained by reference to the concept of the environmentalism of the poor developed by Joan Martínez Alier in his 2003 book of that name. For Martínez Allier, these social movements have risen as a response to the impacts of industrial countries' dependency on raw materials or consumption goods imported from the global South. For these groups, the environment is a source of and requirement for livelihood. The “locals” are neither the beneficiaries of Western development nor partners on sustainable cultural/environmental projects. The ecological disruption is coextensive with damage to the social fabric. Often these communities or alliances of communities claim their rights over indigenous/historical territorial rights but also resort to discourses on the sacredness of nature and/or life or other “discredited” philosophies of nature, risking the taint of superstition, animism, vitalism, anthropomorphism, and so forth. More recently, Rob Nixon in <italic>Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor</italic> (2011) has contextualized this resurgent the environmentalism of the poor in the current historical context of capitalism in which ecology and humans have become disposable. The neoliberal era has intensified assaults on resources, but it also has intensified resistance “whether through isolated site-specific struggles or through activism that has reached across national boundaries in an effort to build translocal alliances.”<sup>17</sup> These “resource rebels,” therefore, cannot afford to be focused on a single issue: their environmental interests “are seamed through with other economic and cultural causes as they experience environmental threat not as a planetary abstraction but as a set of inhabited risks.”<sup>18</sup> 
            <italic>Los zorros</italic> cannot tell yet a story of popular environmental movements such as the ones taking place in contemporary Latin America. Nevertheless, <italic>Los zorros</italic> can be understood as an indirect illustration of the historical background from which these movements have emerged, as a sort of cultural prehistory of popular environmentalisms. In a way, <italic>Los zorros</italic> maps the kind of limitations and conditions, within the politics of resistance, that popular environmentalisms have had to overcome in order to come to fruition.</p>
