CAPISTRANO The deliberate destruction or mutilation of art, like its creation, often makes a significant statement about the society that produced it. This essay will explore the dynamics of artistic creation and deliberate destruction as expressed in one art form?the Maori feather box. In handling and studying a sampling of 90 largely unpublished Maori feather boxes in seven museums in Europe and one in the United States, out of a body of about 320 extant in the two continents,1 I discovered that five containers appear to have been intentionally mutilated. The damaged boxes include an East Coast wakahuia, or elliptical container, dating to at least as early as 1832 (fig. 1); two Gisborne papahou, or 1. Based on Simmons (1982) and his unpublished checklist of Maori objects in European museums, there appear to be 239 feather boxes in European collections and 81 in American institutions. The feather boxes I studied were those in the collection of the Museum of Mankind in London, the Archaeology and Anthropology Museum in Cambridge, the Pitt-Rivers Museum in Oxford, the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Munich, the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde in Frankfurt, the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, the Mus?e de l'Homme in Paris, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. This essay is based on data gathered for a master's thesis submitted to the Department of Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University. I am grateful to Dr. Suzanne Blier and Dr. George Corbin for fruitful discussions that helped shape this essay. I thank Francesco Pellizzi and Remo Guidieri for many useful and thought-provoking comments and suggestions. But I remain responsible for my mistakes. I am indebted to David Simmons for generously sharing his unpublished documentation of Maori feather boxes in European collections and for his interest in this project. I thank the following museum curators and staff for their many kindnesses and cooperation: Dr. Rose Schubert of the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde, Munich; Dr. Johanna Agthe of the Museum f?r V?lkerkunde, Frankfurt am Main; Madame Marie Claire Bataille-Benguigui of the Mus?e de l'Homme, Paris; Dorota C. Starzecka and her assistant Jill Hasell of the Museum of Mankind, London; Dr. Henrietta Moore and John Osbourne of the Pitt-Rivers Museum, Oxford; Linda Cheetham of the Archaeology and Anthropology Museum, Cambridge; J. H. van Brakel of the Tropenmuseum, Amsterdam; and Douglas Newton, Julie Jones, Dr. Kate Ezra, Heidi King, and Virginia Webb of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

Since the section below the forehead is relatively sturdy, and because the loss occurs at the same point in all five cases, it is unlikely that the mutilations were inadvertent. That the excisions were deliberate is further indicated by carving designs on the broken section of one of the Gisborne containers: what would have been a rough surface where the break occurs has been completely smoothed and carved with a small, naturalistic face that looks more European than Maori (fig. 3d). The occurrence of ritual mutilation among the Maori has not been discussed in the literature before, nor have the unusual excisions from the five containers mentioned above been noted. I suggest in this paper not only that ritual mutilation did occur, but also that this practice was a consequence of the container's function as a repository of spiritual power and as a symbol of tribal continuity. Scholars have established that ritual mutilation of objects was practiced in a number of traditional societies. It is generally accepted, for example, that Mimbres pottery bowls from the American Southwest were ritually "killed" by puncturing the bottom before they were interred with the deceased as part of the funerary offering. In Java, ceremonial breaking of the ceramic water vessel called I wish to acknowledge grants from the Asian Cultural Council and Ford Foundation, New York, and the American Association of University Women, Washington, D.C., which supported part of the research for this paper. 2. Provenance and dates are based on museum records and Simmons's unpublished manuscripts on Maori objects in European collections. Although the accuracy of Simmons's catalogs has been questioned (Kaeppler 1987: 248), I found that at least in the case of the feather boxes, his dates closely approximate museum acquisition dates when these are available. 3. See Capistrano, figure 112. Another box that I have not been able to see but which appears to have been similarly mutilated is a wakahuia presented in 1833 by C. W.

In another manifestation of ritual destruction, the people of South Sumatra set up the tree of life called kayu ara, a tall pole hung with textiles, mats, and baskets. At the end of life-crisis ceremonies, the tree was plundered and destroyed so that existence could begin again (Gittinger 1979: 35). Similarly, in the New Hebrides, effigies representing ancestral spirits were ceremonially riddled with arrows, then burned. Guidieri and Pellizzi (1981: 52-53) hypothesize that this was to assure their return. While the immediate motivation for ritual destruction may vary somewhat in the examples cited, the common underlying principle is a symbolic immolation that effectuates the desired manipulation of spiritual forces associated with the objects destroyed. I shall demonstrate that such was also the case among the Maori. The spirit of things The notion that inanimate objects possess a spirit has been noted in many traditional cultures. With the Maori, all things, including man-made objects, were similarly believed to possess a spiritual life.4 Complex ideas regarding this immaterial existence of things are expressed, for example, in the Maori concepts of hau (vital principle) and mauri (life principle),5 which persons and things were believed to possess. That the Maori believed in a multidimensional reality is further illustrated in the tale of how fairies, when offered greenstone and shark-tooth ornaments as gifts, took the "appearance" of the gifts but left their substance behind (Hanson and Hanson 1983: 44-45). Moreover, objects?like persons and places?might be imbued with great mana (extraordinary power derived from the gods) or be in a state of tapu (under the influence of the gods and therefore subject to prescribed rules of behavior).6 Since the presence of spiritual forces could be beneficial or detrimental depending on the circumstances, assorted methods of expelling godly influences from inanimate objects were often employed. It is recounted, for example, that when a Waikato chief presented a European with a bust of himself that he had made, the chief first licked the wooden image all over in order to remove his personal tapu from the carving (ibid.: 75). Maori chiefs invited to tea by early European visitors would, after having finished the beverage, dash the teacup to the floor to dispel the spiritual forces that had entered the cup through contact with the lips (ibid.: 53). In both examples, according to Hanson and Hanson, the intention was to ensure that the chiefs tapu spread no further, to the possible detriment of both himself and any future owner or user. Furthermore, measures to protect oneself from sorcery were taken through careful disposal of excreta and bodily clippings such as fingernail parings and cut hair?things in which a person's hau was believed to linger (ibid.: 65-66; Angas 1847: 91, 329). In the case of the carved feather boxes, these were carefully hung from the rafters of the chiefs house out of the reach of children and were not to be touched by anyone but the chief (Simmons 1984: 183). This precaution was taken to protect other people who were not of equivalent rank (ibid.). The feather box was particularly potent because it contained objects that had touched the most tapu part of the chief?his head. Deliberate mutilation of the boxes, therefore, might have been performed to neutralize the spiritual forces present in the box due to its association with the chief. Why only a few of the boxes studied were mutilated and the vast majority were not poses a crucial and difficult question that this essay cannot answer conclusively. Simmons (1984: 101; 1985: 49) notes that although feather boxes were traditionally carved by the aristocracy for personal use or for gift exchange, many were made for the tourist trade in the nineteenth century. This is one factor among many that might be considered. Certainly the value and potency of the particular container, the circumstances in which it was given or sold, by whom and to whom, must all have played an important role. Since such information is usually unrecorded and unfortunately lost to us now, we must search for clues to be found in what we have at hand ? namely, the feather boxes themselves?and in what we know of Maori customs and beliefs. Ancestors and deities Maori feather boxes were carved from a single piece of wood by chiefs and priests, or tohunga. They were used to store feather headdresses and other precious objects such as decorative combs that had touched the chiefs head. One lug, usually in the form of an anthropomorphic head, projects from each end of the case. To these two end lugs were tied suspension 4. Barrow (1984: 23), among others, clearly describes this phenomenon. 5. There is some disagreement as to the precise meaning of these terms.

E. 1909.105 (Z6597). cords, allowing the container to be hung from the rafters of the house. Besides the decorative end lugs, the outside of the box and lid were often carved with elaborate surface patterns and anthropomorphic figures. Excellence in carving these ornate boxes was considered a hallmark of personal accomplishment among the nobility (Simmons 1985: 49). In addition to the ornate surface carving, anthropomorphic figures known as tiki and manaia are often portrayed in relief on the bottom or on the lid of the box. Although various explanations have been proposed for tiki and manaia figures in general, their specific meaning in the context of the feather box has not been satisfactorily explained. A better understanding of the tiki and manaia figures in this context gives considerable strength to the hypothesis of ritual mutilation and its motivations. On feather boxes, tiki figures are almost always carved in sets, the basic combination being the tiki pair. The simplest manifestation of the pair consists of the two anthropomorphic heads projecting from each end of the box,7 to which the suspension cords were normally tied. On the box lid or bottom, two tiki are frequently carved in relief in corresponding placement on each end, either head to head, feet to feet, or one upside down in relation to the other. They often come together in explicit copulation (fig. 5). In some cases, three or more tiki may be positioned in a vertical column, with a copulating couple incorporated in the group (fig. 6). Scenes of copulation appear not infrequently on these boxes. The subject is explicit in eight of the 90 boxes studied, and clearly implied in 14 others. The overwhelming majority of these mating scenes depict the couple feet to feet. More complex combinations are often built around the basic copulating couple. A mask8 or a full figure, or another couple?also copulating? might be wedged between the main couple. The addition of secondary figures builds up to a multiplicity of images. One may find some masks overlaying the couple's genitals and other heads emerging from them, while additional figures crowd between the main couple. The combination is carried to its most complex rendition in two papahou from Gisborne. The first (fig. 2b), attributed to one of the few Maori carvers known by name?Raharuhi Rukupo of Rongowhakaata?and believed to have been carved about 1840,9 is among 7. Of the 90 containers I studied, only one had plain lugs. All the rest had lugs in the form of an anthropomorphic head. 8. The term is used here to refer to the head depicted without the body. 9.

As in a number of other examples, the end figures of this container have the head in the round, thus functioning as end lugs, with the body extending to the bottom of the box in relief. Oriented feet to feet and almost meeting at the center, each end tiki has a profile manaia mask on its abdominal-genital area biting its phallus. Between these two figures is a copulating couple of almost equal size, perpendicular to the first pair, and cutting across the bottom and sides of the box. Each member of the central copulating couple is flanked by two more tiki?one male and the other female?each grasping and biting one arm of the adjacent end figure. The second papahou (fig. 7), which according to museum records dates to at least as early as 1886, appears to have been derived from the piece attributed to Rukupo. Although it is unfinished, a virtually identical composition is evident on the container's bottom, while on its lid is carved a copulating couple in the feet-to-feet position. Another configuration that occurs in a number of the 90 boxes studied consists again of a copulating couple placed feet to feet, and a third figure on top of one of the two other figures, thus forming a multifigure column (fig. 6). This configuration occurs with striking consistency on five samples, three of which are in the northern style and two in the eastern style.10 Similar configurations occur in a number of published boxes not included in my sampling. The tiki pair used as end figures, or carved on the bottom or the lid as the main theme, in short, appears to be the predominant figurative design combination on feather boxes. As described above, two types of configurations found in several of the containers studied are built on the basic theme of the copulating couple. In both types, more complex combinations are created by the addition of subsidiary masks or figures either wedged between the original couple or incorporated in a multifigure column. The latter type occurs in both early and late northern and eastern containers. That complex combinations such as these remain consistent through time and space suggests that the images signify specific ideas, if not particular personages, of substantial pan-Maori importance. Two interpretations of the theme of the copulating couple have been proposed?one pointing to an abstract concept and the other to a specific representation. The first explanation (Barrow 1969: 116) suggests that the subject is an expression of the tribe's desire for survival through fertility and abundance. The second interpretation (Simmons 1984: 215; 1985: 50-51) identifies images of the copulating couple as representations of the primordial parents, Rangi and 10. Simmons (1984: 79), elaborating on earlier work on the subject of Maori art styles by Gilbert Archey and Sir Apirana Ngata, identifies two major carving styles: the northern or serpentine style, predominant in the northern and northwestern areas, and the eastern or square style, predominant in the eastern areas of North Island.</page><page sequence="8">Capistrano: Ritual mutilation of power objects 61 Papa. The two views do not necessarily contradict each other: in traditional societies, the themes of fertility, reproduction, and continuity are often intertwined. This interplay is vividly illustrated, for example, in the New Hebrides, where, in a repetition of the act performed by the ancestor Kabat, men and women ritually copulated during ceremonies associated with the agrarian cycle (Guidieri and Pellizzi 1981: 39-41). In the Maori version, the subject of copulation appears to refer both to the concept of tribal survival and continuity through fertility and abundance and to the ultimate source of all life, the primeval ancestors Rangi and Papa. According to the myth, Rangi the Sky Father and Papa the Earth Mother were constantly locked in a tight embrace. Their children, trapped in the suffocating darkness between, conspired to separate them and thus emerge from the blackness. All of the brothers, with the exception of one, took turns trying to push their parents apart, but with little success. Finally it was Tane's turn. Lying on the sand with his feet anchored against a stone ridge, he heaved and pushed with all his might and forced Rangi and Papa asunder, thus fixing the Sky above and the Earth below. Reveling in dazzling light, the gods rushed to lay claim to Earth's bounty. Tane claimed the birds, trees, and all things of the forests. He also created the first man (Izett 1904: 19, 27-43).11 As one recounts the legend, certain themes that occur and recur on the feather boxes come to mind: the couple locked in tight embrace; the masks and figures wedged between the couple; the many images between and spilling out around the main pair. It is likely that the configurations discussed above, appearing consistently on containers from different tribal groups and time periods, represent key scenes from the legend. Simmons (1985: 50-51) comes to this same conclusion, at least in the case of two boxes in New Zealand collections, one of which portrays a 11. In other versions of the myth, Tane created not man but woman, and named her Hine-ahuone. He had a daughter by her named Hine-titama or Dawn Maiden, and again another daughter by Hine-titama. When Hine-titama realized that she had committed incest with her father, she fled to the underworld and assumed the name Hine-nui-tepo (Hanson and Hanson 1983: 37-38, 77). ^*%im?^ K- / ) f.y. &lt;*s .^-# \W&amp;&lt;?

E.1908.96(Z6593). somewhat simpler version of the configuration on the mutilated box attributed to Rukupo (fig. 2b), and the other a rendition of the basic copulating couple in the feet-to-feet position illustrated in figure 5. More than mere literal illustrations of myths, however, the figures seem to convey a multiplicity of meanings, most significant of which ? in view of the importance of genealogy in Maori culture?is the allusion to the owner's descent from the gods. The theme of the copulating couple does not simply portray Rangi and Papa, with or without their children, but appears to call attention to the miracle of creation and the continuous transference of extraordinary power from the gods to one's ancestors, and on to the owner of the box. One important indicator of the transference of spiritual power is the image of the manaia. Perhaps the most intriguing and certainly the most debated of Maori themes, the manaia is a composite creature with a beaked mouth and reptilian body, often depicted in association with the tiki. It has been interpreted as a serpent or lizard (Hamilton in Tregear 1902; Skinner 1924), a bird, a bird-headed man (Hamilton and Skinner in Archey 1933), or a sea horse. In the 1930s, Gilbert Archey (1933; 1936) proposed that the motif was none of these, but simply a human image in profile. Barrow (1961: 206) disputed Archey's theory some thirty years later, contending that the manaia was not merely a human figure in profile, but a distinct ?mage that represented a man-biting spirit. Fraser (1966: 54), generally agreeing with Barrow, suggested that manaia was probably related to the associated tiki figure but had essentially negative powers. More recently, Simmons (personal communication, 15 October 1986) has emphasized the composite nature of the image, which he interprets as being part bird (connoting immortality) and part lizard (connoting death). Similarly, Guidieri (1987: 154) sees in the ?mage a hybrid being and/or an exceptional being endowed with authority. I tend to agree with the two latter interpretations proposed by Simmons and Guidieri. I would add, however, that contrary to theories assigning an essentially malevolent role to the manaia, visual and contextual evidence point to a benevolent function. In other words, the biting action of the manaia seems to portray a beneficent imparting of power. As in other Maori art forms, the manaia carved on the feather boxes appear in extraordinary contortions, often biting the associated tiki's neck, shoulders, armpits, thighs, or genitals. Manaia heads might also take the place of the tiki's hands and feet. That the manaia perform a magical function is strongly suggested by their presence on the two most sacred parts of the Maori anatomy?the genitals and the head. On three boxes studied, dating from about 1840 to 1865, the abdominal-genital area of each end figure is overlaid with a manaia profile (Capistrano n.d.: figs. 102-104).</page><page sequence="10">Capistrano: Ritual mutilation of power objects 63 On the earliest of the three boxes?the mutilated box attributed to Rukupo?the manaia is depicted on each end tiki's abdominal-genital area, fiercely biting the figure's phallus (fig. 2c). The manaia are often seen flanking the associated tiki and biting each side of its head, not just in feather boxes but in relief-carved architectural elements as well. This aspect of biting is important and was interpreted by Barrow (1961: 206) as evidence of a malevolent disposition, thus leading him to the conclusion that the manaia belong to a group of man eating spirits called atua ngau tangata. The biting action likewise led Douglas Fraser (1966: 54) to propose that the manaia might be atua, or spirits with essentially negative powers. The opposite, however, could very well be true? the biting manaia could actually be imparting, rather than taking away, power. Pasztory (1982: 15), in a study of North American Indian shamanistic art, called attention to a similar dilemma. Representations of human and nonhuman figures locked in struggle, she observed, signify the ambivalence of spiritual power. Physical contact may represent protection or threat, but because the threatening powers are often transformed into agents of protection, it is often unclear which representation is intended. A similar ambiguity applies to the case at hand. Among the Maori, the presence of spiritual influences was believed to be harmful in some cases?causing fear, illness, or death ? but dramatically beneficial in others?stimulating good crops, or imparting power in battle (Hanson and Hanson 1983: 50-52). Although divine assistance was considered essential for the success of all human endeavors, being in a state of tapu or under the influence of the gods clearly was not always helpful. If the influencing atua were wicked or angry, for instance, its tapu could be destructive (ibid.: 60). Nonetheless, the Maori were adept at manipulating the rules of tapu to usher divine influence into persons, places, and things where they wanted it (ibid.: 56-58). Maori explanations of the manaia reveal a similar equivocation between the positive and the negative. According to one group, the manaia represents the personal atua or spirit of the human (tiki) portrayed with it (Barrow 1961: 206). Another group, however, claims that it is a huge bird that threatened humanity in earlier times (ibid.). The carved image of the manaia is equally ambiguous, for it incorporates opposing ?mages denoting immortality (bird) and death (lizard). One key to this paradox might lie in Guidieri's (1987: 154) assertion that throughout Oceania authority and its figures are expressions of ontological ambiguity, chiefs being half human and half divine, simultaneously alive and dead. The manaia figure, he continues, is a synthetic representation of ambiguity itself. More than this?and ?n view of the Maori propensity toward anthropomorphizing the abstract?I suggest that the ambivalent image of the manaia is the physical substantiation of the unseen atua. Furthermore, if one looks closely at the ways in which extraordinary forces were believed to pass between the human and spiritual realms, it becomes increasingly clear that an essentially benevolent rather than a malevolent transfer of power is represented. The predominant channel through which spiritual forces traveled was by contact (Hanson and Hanson 1983: 53-54). The passage of divine influences through contagion, and specifically by biting, is clearly illustrated in a ritual traditionally performed by a deceased chiefs eldest son: he bit the ear or big toe of the corpse in order to acquire his father's mana (ibid.: 61). At first sight, this example would seem to support the assumption that biting draws power from the individual being bitten. Another important ritual, however, demonstrates that biting operates in two directions. In a whakanoau ritual known as ngau paepae, or "biting the beam," an individual who had become highly tapu through contact with sacred knowledge or objects of great mana was returned to a noa, or non tapu, state by biting the latrine beam?the latrine being the threshold across which godly influences passed between the realm of the spirits and the human world (ibid.: 77-86). Biting in this case functioned in the reverse direction. Power was imparted by the entity that performed the biting action. In view of this, it then becomes evident that the carved manaia that are depicted biting the associated tiki could very well symbolize the transference of power by the spirits, as embodied in the manaia, to man, as represented by the tiki. According to Simmons (personal communication, 15 October 1986), in fact, the presence of manaia on the genitals indicates the suprahuman nature of the figure represented. Moreover, 12. Whakanoa means to remove the tapu, or to make noa (Hanson and Hanson 1983: 75).</page><page sequence="11">64 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 the high chief's, or ariki's, descent from the gods is symbolized by the substitution of manaia for shoulders (ibid.). Consequently, one begins to appreciate the full significance of the formal similarities between the tiki and manaia already noted by Archey (1933; 1936). The similitude is not accidental, for the divine is anthropomorphized in the synthetic image of the manaia. Correspondingly, the convergence of the human and the divine is revealed in the bonding of the two mana/a-like profiles that make up the bifurcated image of the tiki?a symbolic figure used to represent mythical beings as well as the ariki, Maori chiefs who are, by virtue of their descent from the gods, themselves part human and part divine. While the image of the biting manaia thus signifies the transference of divine forces to man, the theme of the copulating couple, as discussed earlier, alludes in turn to the owner's genealogy and to familial and ethnic continuity. These concepts of power and continuity that are conveyed by the iconography of the feather box are echoed by its contents?precious feathers as insignia of power and prestige, and family heirlooms such as greenstone ornaments handed down through generations. Feathers and the supernatural The feathers of a great variety of native birds were prized as headdresses by the Maori aristocracy. The kinds of feathers used, the manner in which they were worn, and the great importance attached to them are recounted in legends. In the story of Hatu-Patu, for example, the hero is depicted preparing for battle by "sticking in his hair all the beautiful feathers befitting a chief, and in each ear he [places] a quantity of soft white down taken from the stomach of the albatross . . ." (Izett 1904: 319). In the legend of Taka Rangi and Rau-Mora, Taka-Rangi is portrayed "wearing upon his head a long white comb made from the bone of a whale, together with a plume of the long downy feathers of the white heron . . ." (ibid.: 398). And in the tale of Maru-tuahu, the nobleman's meticulous toilette is described thus: "[he] went to a stream and washed his hair. Then having combed it out, he tied it up in a knot very carefully, and in the knot he stuck . . . fifty red kaka [parrot] feathers. Amongst these red feathers he fixed the plume of a white heron and the tail of a huia" (ibid.: 333). The great value attached to feathers is explained in part by the symbolic significance of birds. Not only were the creatures an important and prestigious source of nourishment, but they were also associated with special powers, particularly with swiftness and heightened ability. The great Taranaki warrior, Te Kawaw, for example, was renowned for being swift of foot, hence his name, which means "bird" or "fowl" (Angas 1847: 88). The bird, moreover, represented immortality (Simmons: personal communication, 15 October 1986). This may well be the reason why carved wooden tombs were also decorated with feathers (Angas 1847: 266, 279). The association of birds with the continuity of life is again expressed in the symbolism attached to feathers when featured in dreams. If a newly married man dreamt of skulls decorated with feathers, it was believed that his wife had conceived. If he dreamt of white heron feathers, he could expect a son, while the black plumes of the huia bird prophesied a daughter (Hanson and Hanson 1983: 20, 48). Moreover, desirable characteristics associated with particular birds may have invested their feathers with special significance. The white heron, for example, the favorite image of the Maori chief, served as a model of chiefly behavior, as expressed in the adage: "A white heron which looks at the food before it eats." The saying admonished the chief to emulate the white heron, which examines its food before eating it. In a like manner, the chief was expected to wait courteously for his guests to join him before partaking of his food (Johansen 1954: 183-184). Finally, birds were under the special care of the forest god, Tane, son of the primordial parents Rangi and Papa. Tane was not only the father of the entire Maori race, he was also lord of the trees and forests, birds, carpenters, woodcarvers, and all things made of wood. As god of the forests and everything in them, Tane received the first bird caught, as well as offerings before the felling of trees (Lewis and Forman 1982: 33). The ideas of potency and continuity are thus consistently conveyed by the feather box and things associated with it?the feather headdress, the birds that provided the feathers, and the wood from which the box was carved, all of which were under the special care of the creator god Tane. The feather box itself was hung from the rafters of the chief's house?an upper realm analogous to the upper realm of the birds, Maori symbols of immortality and suprahuman powers. All symbolic elements converge, overlap, and reinforce each other to reiterate the central concepts of tribal continuity and power.</page><page sequence="12">Capistrano: Ritual mutilation of power objects 65 Continuity and disruption As symbols of power and prestige, the feather boxes were traditionally carved by members of the aristocracy not only for personal use but for gift exchange as well (Simmons 1984: 101; 1985: 49). Information on the bilateral exchange of goods among the Maori is not lacking. Unfortunately, however, there are no further data on the circumstances surrounding the use of feather boxes as objects of exchange. In a society dependent on agriculture for subsistence, the most important item of trade, not surprisingly, was food (Hanson and Hanson 1983: 107). The exchange of food was often accomplished through the mutual hosting of feasts?events accompanied by ceremonious actions and speeches of greeting and welcome. In a similar manner, the formal presentation of other items of exchange such as greenstone, obsidian, large canoes, huia feathers (ibid.: 107-110), flax cloaks (Angas 1847: 323), and feather boxes was most likely accompanied by an analogous exchange of speeches and ceremonious behavior. A ritual mutilation of the feather boxes probably would not have been necessary in such a context. This is because although each Maori group was a potential enemy of the other, their involvement in bilateral exchange indicated a cordial relationship. It was only when one group was unable or disinclined to make a countergift or reciprocal action that the shortcoming was construed as an insult and the relationship degenerated from a friendly to a hostile one (Hanson and Hanson 1983: 113). Consequently, it seems unlikely that one chief would present another with a mutilated box. Arguing from the premise that mutilation would have been performed to protect the previous owner by ensuring that his personal tapu did not come into contact with malevolent forces, such action would have expressed a mistrust of the recipient by the giver and could very well have been considered an insult. Furthermore, a box presented in gift exchange probably would have been carved specifically for this purpose and therefore would not have had a history of personal use by the giver. A whakanoa ritual similar to the removal of tapu from newly carved houses or canoes, which were tapu during the carving process (ibid.: 74), would more likely have been employed rather than mutilation. On the other hand, if the box?particularly an old one?were to be transferred to an outsider who operated beyond the sphere of the Maori gods?a Pakeha (European), for example?then perhaps some other means of neutralizing the spiritual forces present in the box would have been deemed necessary. I suggest that ritual mutilation was performed to cut the flow of spiritual influences from such objects?a precaution analogous to the licking of the wooden image or the smashing of used teacups mentioned earlier. In a sense, such action would also have signaled a break in the continuity of personal and tribal history and power. Significantly, four of the five mutilated containers studied date between approximately 1832 and 1860 (the date of the fifth container is unknown), a period when European colonization of New Zealand was at its peak and traditional Maori culture appeared most threatened (King 1983:48-50). A consequence of European colonization was disjunction. The rules of tapu were broken. Missionaries ordered the burning of "heathen" sculpture. Pakeha schoolteachers forbade the use of the Maori language. Settlers encroached upon tribal lands. Amidst such changes, the instances in which feather boxes traditionally meant for personal use might have been given to Pakeha are varied. They could have been presented to colonial officials or sold to souvenir hunters. They also could have been used in lieu of Pakeha money: ... we lost all the treasures from our house to pay for the doctor. We had kiwi cloaks and carvings that my mother gave to the doctor because she couldn't afford cough mixture. When I look back I think, "Kiwi cloaks. What a payment." And that doctor, he had a good collection. (Brake et al. 1980: 188) Moreover, the Maori regarded the Pakeha with awe. Indeed, the power of the foreigners and their god often seemed far greater than that of the atua. The Maori were particularly impressed by European technology, the efficacy of which they ascribed to the divine: The second day after we were at sea, I saw a group of savages lying round the binnacle, all intently occupied in observing the phenomenon of the magnetic attraction. . . . "This," said they, "is the white man's God, who directs them safely to different countries, and then can guide them home again. . . ." (Earle in Hanson and Hanson 1983: 41) Accordingly, there were those who thought that the European himself was divine: The missionaries have told us that God dwells in the heavens. This I no longer believe. The White man himself is the god. (Best in Hanson and Hanson 1983: 47)</page><page sequence="13">66 RES 17/18 SPRING/AUTUMN 89 It is unlikely that the Maori, cognizant of the white man's power, would freely turn over their objects of power without first having taken precautionary measures to protect themselves from the Pakeha's magic. Preventive actions associated with the removal of power objects from their traditional context in the face of colonization are well documented in other cultures. When European missionaries officially abolished "idolatry" in the Society Islands, for example, the inhabitants were careful to gather up and bury their powerful anthropomorphic sculptures of divine beings called ti'i lest they fall into the hands of the foreigners (Henry in Babadzan 1982: 71). Similarly, among the Maori: Unless you know where to look, you won't find any original carvings in this area. They were burned or hidden. Among other Maoris we have the reputation of being the most expert at hiding our face. The carvings of my tribe as I say are hidden, but before that I believe they were burned. (Brake et al. 1980: 226) Mutilation of the wooden lug head in order to neutralize the power of the feather box is clearly consistent with Maori beliefs. The head, as already discussed, was the most sacred part of the body, the locus of great power. This preoccupation with the head was widespread in Oceania, where trophy heads and skulls of ancestors and enemies often affirmed a warrior's rank and prowess. As the seat of extraordinary power, the head was also the part through which the body could be made most vulnerable. Thus decapitation and blows on the head were a frequent means of dispatching the enemy. Fijian warriors, for instance, availed of an assortment of wooden clubs specially designed for damaging specific parts of the enemy's head. Analogous methods are known to have been employed in the symbolic slaying of objects. In the Society Islands, for example, one way of "killing" the stone ti'i was by hitting its head with a hatchet (Babadzan 1982: 69). Among the Maori, the analogy between life and ritual is most striking. In hand-to-hand combat and the ritual execution of prisoners, a slicing blow with the patu's (a Maori short club) deadly blade was aimed at the head: The thrust was given into the temple of doomed men, and with a sharp turn of the wrist the top of the head was jerked open. (Robley 1915:33) In the five feather boxes in question, each of the mutilated lug heads was sliced at the temple in this manner (figs. 1, 2a, 3a,c, 4).13 REFERENCES Adhyatman, Sumarah 1987 Kendi.
