<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rodrigues, Hillary Peter. Ritual worship of the great goddess: the liturgy ofthe Durga Puja with interpretations. xvi, 417 pp., illus., bibliogr. Albany, NY: SUNY Press, 2003. $71.50 (cloth), $23.95 (paper) This book focuses on the rituals performed in the course of devi worship during the festival of Durga Puja in northern India and Nepal. Unsurprisingly, the translation of the liturgy testifies to the wide range of sources that come together in these rituals: thus vedic and puranic sources are complemented by elements from the devotionalist tradition and tantric symbolism. Furthermore, like other complex rituals, the text of the liturgy draws on multiple levels of representation and inter? pretation. The book starts with a brief genesis of the Durga Puja, which is followed by a sketch of the context within which this study was conducted, before the author proceeds to a detailed description of the ritual itself. The latter makes up the main part of the book and provides those with a specific interest in the study of ritual and the meaning of Hindu symbolism - and only such readers will per- severe - with rare insights into the way in which the worship of Durga expresses funda? mental Hindu principles, in particular with reference to femininity and cosmic renewal. The puja for the devi, in this case the goddess Durga, appears as a complex set of ritual clusters, each centring around a specific material form of the goddess - who is repre- sented in, and evoked as, various forms, among them a jar, a banana plant, a tantric mandala, and a virgin {kumari), before she appears in the form of the familiar clay image depicting Durga slaying the buffalo-demon, mahisa. For the ritual specialist - Western and Eastern alike - it is significant that Rodrigues's Brahmin informants point out that every object, sound, smell, and gesture facilitates the goddess s presence and that every part of the ritual highlights specific aspects of the Great Goddess, who is worshipped in progressively more anthropomorphic forms. These corre- spond to various states of purity and auspi- ciousness in the female lifecycle, which are addressed in manifold ways throughout the festival, but the main rituals characteristically depend on male ritual experts who command some knowledge of Sanskrit. Consequently, Durga Puja is here dis? cussed on the basis of elaborations by</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 469 Brahmin priests, who perform sacrifice and specific forms of worship like kumari puja on behalf of their paying clients. Thus the role of the purohit is emphasized throughout, but ele? ments of wider importance to the worship- pers, such as the strong influence of bhakti cults on Durga worship in general and the Bengali form of Durga Puja in particular, are downplayed. There is a discrepancy between the detailed discussion of the liturgy and the search for meaning in even the smallest acts performed by the priests and the superficial contextualization of the Durga Puja as a ritual more often than not organized by committees rather than by a single affluent family. The dis? cussion of its wider implications, which is rel- egated to the last two chapters, tries instead to highlight the 'nature' and the 'function' of Durga Puja. As a study of the liturgy this book is cer- tainly meticulously researched, and the author takes great care to explain the various ele? ments on the basis of readings of the available printed sources and to incorporate countless examples of stories, myths, and everyday ref? erences. However, only readers with some knowledge of Hindu rites will be able to imagine the way in which these complex rituals are performed and, despite the promise of an anthropologically informed study of ritual in the introduction, the context remains vague. Since the ethnography consists largely of conversations with one well-informed purohit, who performs pujas for various com? mittees and families in Varanasi, the reader without first-hand experience of Durga Puja is ill equipped to understand the significance of these rituals in the lives of the worshippers. Furthermore, since the discussion of Durga Puja is largely ahistorical, and more general scholarly work on pujas and rituals is only superficially explored, it does not lead to further insights into the nature of Durga Puja, nor into the ways in which the liturgy conveys meanings and contributes to the Pujas popularity. Since the setting is described in passing, one cannot but wonder whether less textual detail and more general back? ground would have provided a more critical and therefore more complete view of one of the most important practices contributing to Hindu identities across the globe.
