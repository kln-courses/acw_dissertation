<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY. II. A VAST amount of labour has been devoted by the Psychi cal Research Society to phenomena of what we may call, if not abnormal, at least unusual, psychology, upon which strict observers of the usual, such as Wundt, are apt to be extremely severe. The main idea of this Society, that mind can act upon mind without the intervention of mat ter, which runs through their hypothesis of telepathy, clairvoyance, and apparitions, is not in itself so absurd as common sense is apt to think. If we examine the law of gravitation or of chemical attraction, which common sense thinks so manifestly true, we find in them a similar absurdity. We believe that every molecule, and every free atom is spatially separated from its neighbour by some substance that is not material in any ordinary sense. Yet we believe that these can act upon each other through this immaterial space. That matter can thus act upon matter at a distance has seemed to philosophers incon ceivable at the very time that they acknowledge that the fact must be so. The case of mind is not more inherently impossible than this. The difficulty lies in proving the premisses. Time after time the Society has discovered fraud in its subjects or inaccuracy in its evidence, and if a certain amount remains that they accept, they are still un able to answer the objection that these, too, may be only cases of imposture or error hitherto undiscovered. Research in the confessedly abnormal, such as the hyp notic or hysterical, is valid only within narrow limits. For it is impossible to accept the judgments of such persons about their own mental states. And they can therefore occupy no higher place for research than animals, in whom we judge of internal processes by outward acts alone. To accept a hypnotic's explanation of his own thought or action is never justifiable, and is usually a manifest absurdity. Much has been written upon animals, and even upon insects. But here the further difficulty enters that in explaining their outward acts we are liable to credit them with human minds, of which we have no proof. This anthropomorphism runs through the writings of most observers of animals, and renders many of them ridicu lous. There is little to be got out of the animal mind but what we ourselves unconsciously put into it. Something is being done in the study of classes and races. MacDonald, for instance, has given rather in teresting tables of varying sensibility to pain. In his early experiments (I895-I896) which were made on I,412 individuals, he found that women are more sensitive to pain than men; that American professional men are more sensitive than American business men; that the labouring classes are much less sensitive to pain than the non labouring classes; that the women of the poorer classes are less sensitive than those in more comfortable condi tions; that the wealthy classes, in general, are more sensitive than the poorer classes, and that the left hand is more sensitive to pain than the right hand. These results are generally confirmed-by a more recent series of experi ments in which MacDonald used a "temple algometer,'r designed by himself. The instrument was pressed against the temple of the subject until a disagreeable sensation was caused, the amount of pressure being registered on a scale. arranged for that purpose. In each case the least sensi bility of pain was noted. Mr. MacDonald's observations extended over a great variety of social conditions and ages, including in all 899 persons. Of these some were public school girls, others private school girls, boys in public schools, university women,washerwomen, business women, and self-educated women. One of the conclusions at which he arrived was that in, general the sensibility to pain decreases as age increases,, The left temple, like the left hand, is more sensitive than; the right. This, it may be pointed out, is in opposition to the results of experiments made by Van Biervielt who found the left side less sensitive than the right, the visiorn of the left eye the less acute, and the left ear the more dull of hearing. Mr. MacDonald found that girls in private schools, who are generally of wealthy parents, are much more sensitive to pain than girls in the public schoolsi. It would appear that refinement and luxury tend to increase sensitiveness to pain. This also accords with previous measurements, which showed that the non-labouring classes were more sensitive to pain than the labouring classes. University women were more sensitive than washerwomen, but less sensitive thai business women, but there did not seem to be any necessary relation between intellectual development and pain sensitiveness. Self-educated women were more sen sitive than business women. This greater sensitiveness of. self-educated women may, he thinks, be due to the over taxing of the nervous system of the former in their unequalS struggle after knowledge. The girls in public schools are more sensitive at all ages than the boys. On the whole Mr. MacDonald's measurements go to show that women are more sensitive to pain than men, and that, as Shaks peare put it long before instruments of precision were used to test sensation, " The hand of lesser employment hatb the daintier sense." The prevailing weakness of psychologists is to talk in terms of cerebral physiology; they had better stand on their own ground. It adds nothing to, indeed detracts from, the strength of a mental analysis when the author tries to explain it in terms of nervous action. Professor James, a notable, sinner in this matter, boldly claims that causality in mind is only thus conceivable. The plea is probably not true, while the practice is confusing and mis leading.

Recent investigation into cerebral action has, on the other hand, been far too obviously coloured by a wish to explain mental processes. All this makes psychology merely a quack physiology. The true science has plenty of legitimate practice before it, and should confine itself thereto.</page></plain_text>
