And architects' economic livelihood and self-identity become a function of the quantity of production rather than of the sustenance through time of a few well-raised offspring. The discourse of obsolescence teaches above all, however, that the life of the building matters, and implicitly makes the sustenance of this life its highest priority. For contemporary architecture to work through its situation under capitalism, then, perhaps it will be necessary to ques tion promiscuity and find a place for sustenance. The architect would try to do more than serve for a brief time a building's legal and economic owner. She would instead try to sustain her building's usefulness and meaningfulness throughout its life, for its inhabitants, for its community, and for its society.
