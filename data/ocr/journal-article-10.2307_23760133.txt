<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes Violence escalates in Chiapas again LONDON (Mexico &amp; NAFTA report). The brutal massacre of 45 people in the village of Acteal in the San Pedro Chenal ho municipality on 22 December, 1997 brought Chiapas back to the front pages again. Most of the victims were women and children. Virtually all of them were shot in the back. They seem to have been slaughtered by thugs from a para military group, Paz y Justicia ("Peace and Justice"), which owes allegiance to the ruling party (PRI, Partido de la Revolución Institucional). It seems that around 60 armed thugs broke into a church service which was being held by the Indians. According to the bishop of San Cristóbal de las Casas, Samuel Ruiz, men, women and children were killed as they prayed in the church. The killing is said to have started about midday and lasted for at least two hours. At least 22 people were wounded in the attack. Doctors who attended to the injured said that the victims had been shot with automatic weapons at point black range. The wounded said that there had not been any warning or explanation from the attackers. The doctors also said that some of the wounded had been hit by dum-dum bullets: these burst on impact, causing horrible internai injuries and therfore have been banned by several countries. The EZLN claims that the paramilitary bands that roam around the state are under the de facto protection of the authorities. The most notorious of these bands is Paz y Justicia which also is supposed to have been behind the assassination attempt on Bishop Samuel Ruiz last year, but there are others such as Chinchulines and the Máscara Roja. Chenalho has been an area where the paramilitaries have been especially active. According to the Centro de Derechos Humanos Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, 150 people had been killed in the municipality in the three months leading up to the Acteal massacre. Following the killing of six people in November, the attackers then burnt down 20 houses in the village. Then, they blockaded the village to stop medical attention or the police reaching the village. Around 30,000 people live in Chenalho, although 2,500 have fled because of the violence. Some early reports said that the Indians were supporters of the Ejército Zapatista de Liberación Nacional (EZLN) but others said that they were simply a peaceful group of Tzotzil (known as abejas or bees) that had been forced from their homes in the villages of Tzaja lum, Chimix and Quextic by the violence in the state in November 1997. Evidence that feelings were running high in the north of the state has been clear for some time. Not only was Bishop Ruiz attacked but the visit of the papal nuncio, Justo Mullor, in December was also tense. At one point the paramilitaries refused to allow him to consécrate a new church which they said would be used only by Zapatistas. Mullor refused to meet the paramilitaries' leaders. Accord ing to Bishop Ruiz and Marina Patricia Jiménez, the secre tary of the Centro de Derechos Humanos in San Cristóbal de las Casas, the local authorities had received a warning that Paz y Justicia was preparing an attack several hours mexicon • Vol. XX • Feb. 1998</page><page sequence="2">before the massacre started. The authorities chose to do nothing until the massacre was over. The conséquences of the slaughter have been significant. The government has been forced to stop allowing the situa tion in Chiapas to fester even though its officiai investigation into the massacre reached the preliminary conclusion that the killings were triggered by a long-standing local power struggle, involving members of the ruling party, PRI. The government has now started to do things that it should have done much earlier, such as disarm the paramilitary groups which operate with impunity in the State. The replacement of Emilio Chuayffet Chemor as minister of the interior by Fran cisco Labastida Ochoa has produced a change in the gov ernment's tone. Labastida, unlike Chuayffet, appears to vi_ »u —7 . . , \t Fig. 1.

Members of the survey team included Masson, Robert Rosenswig, Daniel Finamore and Georgia West. The site has been protected by its current res idents and guardians, Fabian and Deodoro Perez, for the past 52 years. Landing on Caye Coco, a large island at the southern end Fig. 2.

Caye Coco may also be a very significant historie site. It may be the location of Chan lacan, the capital of the frontier Maya who rebelled against Spanish Bacalar in 1547. According to Belize historian Grant Jones (1989: 283-284) in his book "Maya Resistance to Spanish Rule," Chanlacan may have been located on Pro greso Lagoon, and it is described in Spanish documents as a fortified island or "poblado en el agua," references which closely match Caye Coco. Future work at this site will deter mine whether or not this site represents Chanlacan, and continue to evalúate Caye Coco's important economic and political role in Precolumbian times. Caye Coco is currently under the protection of the Department of Archaeology, Belmopan. Belize, and the site is not open for tourism. ?r * Fig. 3.

In March 1997 a mexicon team, consisting of Christian Prager and Karl Herbert Mayer, guided by an inhabitant of the small village of San Miguel, visited the little-known Maya ruins of La Montura, located in the Guatemalan Department of Peten, north of Lake Peten-Itza. It is a small archaeological site with no standing architecture but with several mounds, ail of which have been severely tunnelled and trenched by looters. The site is situated in a scarcely wooded région and within large maize fields; it is locally also known as Kinin. The ruins are rela tively easily accessible and not far from the road which connects the town of San Andres on the north shore of the lake Peten-Itza with the ruins of Uaxactun. The exact geo graphical location of La Montura was obtained by a hand held GPS navigator giving the foliowing readings: latitude 17° 12.30' N, longitude 89° 59.11' W. Tikal lies 32 km to the east, as the parrot flies. Ian Graham lists La Montura (Corpus of Maya Hiero glyphic Inscriptions, Volume 3, Part 3, Cambridge, 1982) as a Maya site with inscriptions and on the accompanying map "The Central Lowlands of the Maya Area" the ruins are featured with the indication that the location is only approx imate. Graham has visited the site and has recorded an in scribed object there. Recently Nikolai Grube revisited La Montura and documented a broken stela, which the mexicon team relocated and recorded. No published record of the stela is known, which will be designated here as La Montura Stela 1. At the end of May 1997 the ruins again were visited by Vilma Fialko of the Instituto de Antropo logía e Historia de Guatemala, Proyecto Triángulo, and Ste fanie Teufel, University of Bonn. As reported by Teufel, local peasants have burned the forest with the purpose of getting further land for maize fields. In the course of these •v:' - mk £r . '--i; JS| |ig&amp;Jf | ' J Fig. 4.

Stela 1 is carved of limestone and the broken sculpture consists of at least three major fragments: a main fragment with a hieroglyphic text, and two smaller fragments. The stela fragments lie close together. The main fragment (Fig. 4) is 316 cm high, 157 cm wide, and 46 cm thick. North-east of this lies the second fragment, which measures 100 cm x 46 cm, and is 42 cm thick. At a distance of 130 cm south-east of the main fragment is the third fragment, measuring 100 cm x 132 cm, and with a thickness of 42 cm. The inscribed fragment shows on one surface a highly eroded hieroglyphic inscription arranged in an unorthodox manner. The maxi mum depth of the low-relief is approximately 5 mm. since Fig. 5. Line drawing of Stela 1 of La Montura (Drawing: Christian Prager 1997). the fallen stela was not moved, it is not known if the reverse side features any carvings. Since one of the minor fragments apparently shows the faint remains of a non-glyphic design, perhaps depicting parts of feathers, there is the possibility that the original complete sculpture featured a figurai re présentation, possible on the surface on which it was lying during the visit by Prager and Mayer. If this supposition proves to be correct, then the glyphic surface would re present the back of the stela. The narrow lateral surfaces are plain. The following commentary on the monument's textual image by Prager is based on field notes and photographs taken by the mexicon team, which fortunately documented the inscription before the burning took place between March and May 1997. Prager writes: "The monument (Fig. 5), originally featured at least 29 hieroglyphic blocks, arranged in four vertical columns of se ven glyph-blocks each, except Column B, which consists of eight blocks. The text is to be read in double columns arranged in blocks that are designated A1 - D7. Due to érosion and the incomplète condition of the monument, hieroglyphic blocks A1-A6 are completely lost, as well as A7, Cl, and Dl. The outlines of the hieroglyphs are still visible at B5, B7, C2, and D6-7. The rest of the text remains partially legible. Stylistically, the monument was carved in an unconventional manner, showing a single hiero glyphic block at position B8, which suggests that the Sculptor miscalculated the space needed for arranging the text. Un fortunately, this glyph-block is too eroded to determine its content. I propose that there is a series of titles or name glyphs at D2-D5. It possibly Starts with ah ? mo', 'he, the ? macaw' (D2) and ? aak '?, turtle' (C3). The glyph-block at D3 shows an anthropomorphic head of unknown reading, adorned pos sibly with an animal headdress. The following block at C4 probably depicts the head variant of Chak, the rain god or GodB. Next cornes an expression (D4) that resembles an Emblem Glyph, specifying a political entity. The glyph most likely reads k'inichl ho aak ahaw, 'sun-faced-five-turtle-lord'. The text proceeds with a glyph at C5 reading ? k'u. It probably belongs to the Emblem Glyph expression, because it shows the silhouette of a sign expressing ahaw, Tord', a typical element of Emblem Glyphs. An obscure hieroglyphic block terminâtes the name phrase consisting of the numerical coef ficient 'five', ho. A Calendar Round date, possibly intro duced by a Distance Number at C6, forms the end of the inscription. The Haab date which is clearly readable, is 17 Kumk'u (C7). The Tzolk'in position (C6) is eroded, but the coefficient must be 6, 7, or 8. I propose that the Distance Number at C6 might be 14 K'in, Connecting the date, which was probably written at the beginning of the inscription, with the Calendar Round at D6-C7. Supposing that the initial date was a Period Ending, the best reconstruction for this Calendar Round might be 8 Ix 17 Kumk'u, which corre sponds to the Long Count date 9.13.10.0.14 (February 5, 702). If we subtract the Distance Number of 14 days from this date the result is 9.13.10.0.0 7 Ahaw 3 Kumk'u (January 22, 702)".

Mayer). In the archaeological 'Museo Dr. José Gómez Panaco' in the city of Balancan, in the Mexican State of Tabasco there are several Maya monuments with hieroglyphic inscriptions, including stelae, stela fragments and altars from the site of Moral (Morales), a looted inscrib ed monument fragment, 76 cm high, allegedly from the ranchería of La Cuchilla, Tabasco, and several limestone mexicon • Vol. XX • Feb. 1998</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 6. Tablet 1 of Santa Elena Balancan (Photo. Karl Herbert Mayer, 1997). tablets with texts from the archaeological site of Santa Ele na on the river San Pedro Mártir, Tabasco, near the border to Guatemala. As Santa Elena is a fréquent toponym in the Maya area, this particular site will be referred to here as Santa Elena Balancan, in order to distinguish it from other Santa Elenas. Only one of the monuments of Santa Elena Balancan in the muséum has been published before: an inscribed limestone sculpture which has been designated here as Tablet 4 (see mexicon 2 (1980): 34 and 5 (1983): 26). This fragmentary monument is 104 cm high, 133 cm wide, and 38 cm thick. There are narrow and piain frame elements at the bottom and the right-hand side. 1t was transferred to the muséum in 1979. It bears no label. Fig. 7. Tablet 2 of Balancan (Photo: Karl Herbert Mayer, 1997). The other three monuments are hitherto unpublished and have been designated as Lápida I through III according to their muséum labels. These low-relief tablets will be designated here as Tablets 1 through 3. In 1986 these monu ments were brought to the muséum by the INAH in coopéra tion with the Instituto de Cultura de Tabasco. Typologically, the sculptures are difficult to determine; they are obviously not stelae. All were found in the vicinity of a bail-court at Santa Elena Balancan. Tablet 1 (Fig. 6) is 175 cm high, 190 cm wide, and 49 cm thick. The front side displays probably 18 glyph-blocks, some of a différent size. The occurrence of numerical coeffi cients in the bar-and-dot System suggests that a calendrical date appears in the text. The repaired tablet has a piain vertical frame element at the right-hand side; the top and bottom, as well as the left-hand side are broken. Tablet 2 (Fig. 7) is 180 cm high, 150 cm wide, and 35 cm thick. The front surface shows a text containing perhaps 12 glyph-blocks within two vertical double-columns. The frag ment is enframed at the bottom and on both sides. The top is broken off. Tablet 3 (Fig. 8) is 160 cm high, 100 cm wide, and 30 cm thick. It consists of two repaired fragments; there is an irregu lar, horizontal fracture in the upper third of the bas-relief sculpture. The carved surface is severely eroded and encom passes more than a dozen glyph-blocks, one associated with three dots, indicating a calendrical Statement in the text. Fig. 8.
