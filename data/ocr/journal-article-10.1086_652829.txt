<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> PAMELA J. WARNER Framing, Symmetry, and Contrast in  Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior  During the 1850s and 1860s, Edmond (18224896) and Jules (1830- 1870) de Goncourt, noted writers, art critics, and collectors, earned a  reputation as passionate connoisseurs of eighteenth-century French art  and culture. Often seen at the bouquinistes' stands along the Seine, the  brothers avidly hunted for prints, drawings, manuscript letters, and other  pre-Revolutionary ephemera, which they used as sources for their books  on the eighteenth century.1 Hours spent in galleries and antiques shops  also rewarded them with innumerable objects for their respected collec- tion of Rococo fine and decorative arts.2 Many contemporaries believed  that the brothers not only collected the eighteenth century but lived it as  well. Indeed, caricatures of the brothers in the literary press sometimes  show them dressed in eighteenth-century clothing such as knee breeches,  with eighteenth-century objects in the background (Fig. 1). Known for  their dyspeptic remarks about the ugliness of modern life, the Goncourts  are often thought to have occupied a Rococo fantasy world. More  recently, scholars have extended the idea to include their home, seeing  it as a reconstruction of eighteenth-century interior design principles.3  An important set of photographs of the brothers' residence, however,  clearly shows that, while they certainly used art objects from the Rococo  as decorative elements in their interiors, their overall design aesthetic  was firmly embedded in values of framing, symmetry, and contrast. The  photographs' extraordinary ensemble of visual evidence reveals how  Edmond de Goncourt orchestrated a domestic experience in which  aesthetic sensations dominated daily life.4  Edmond's personal photo album, now in the Frits Lugt Collection of  the Fondation Custodia in Paris, contains forty-four interior and exterior  views of the Goncourts' house in Auteuil, which the brothers purchased  in 1868.5 While series of photographs of nineteenth-century interiors  exist, apparently no single high bourgeois residence was as completely  documented as the Goncourts' house. The photographs, taken between  1883 and 1895, include both public and private spaces, from the salons  and study to the bedroom and bathroom. Today, they represent a  precious visual record of how Edmond de Goncourt decorated the broth- Pamela ].

Thorough study of the photographs is especially warranted in light of  the inordinate amount of attention given to Edmond's textual account of  his house, which is partly responsible for the exaggerated notion of the  residence as an eighteenth-century recreation. His immensely popular  book La Maison d!un artiste, a virtual room-by-room guided tour of the  house in Auteuil, was published in 1881, both participating in and  encouraging a growing craze for all things domestic.6 La Maison describes  the residence at length, presenting it as a showcase for the Goncourts'  collections of eighteenth-century French and Far Eastern art, beginning  in the vestibule, visiting each room in the house, and emerging at the  end in the garden.7 In between, Edmond discusses wall colors, furniture,  and art objects, animating his descriptions with personal anecdotes that  recount purchases, provenances, techniques, and the historical impor- tance of some of their finest and/or favorite items. The resulting six  hundred pages are an odd hybrid that belongs to no established literary  genre—part interior design manual, part art history catalogue, part  autobiography.  Edmond long dreamed of a luxurious illustrated edition, and many of  the photographs in his album are the result of aborted projects to fulfill  his wishes.8 At some point shortly before July 1883, the French photog- rapher Fernand Lochard first came to Auteuil to photograph the house.9  Goncourt's illustrated edition never became a reality, but, at the end of  his life, he constructed the photo album with forty-four images of the  house, a visual Maison des Goncourt that provides unprecedented access  to the entirety of the Goncourts' abode.  While some of the photographs were clearly intended as illustrations  for Edmond's book, viewing them only in these terms subordinates them  to the text and assumes an easy, one-to-one relationship between the  visual and verbal representation of the house. Indeed, previous attempts  to "match" the photographs to the text of La Maison only reveal the  futility of such facile interpretations.10 Scholars tend to end their anal- yses after merely identifying some of the items visible in the images,  routinely using the Goncourts' Journal and Edmond's book La Maison as  textual authorities, as if the mere identification of Rococo objects in a  room qualified it as exhibiting a Rococo design aesthetic. The creation of  decorative panels, the use of symmetry and framing, and the importance  of contrasts, however, results in a fully nineteenth-century appearance.  These decorating principles form the meta-criteria that governed the  </page> <page sequence="3"> 38 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Spring-Summer 2008  FIGURE 1  Paul Hadol, E. et J. de Goncourt, caricature  from he Gaulois 4, no. 107 (May 1860): 5.

The Decoration of the Goncourts' Parisian Apartment  Before analyzing the visual evidence of the house in Auteuil, how- ever, it is important first to consider the way the brothers decorated their  Parisian apartment, at 43 rue Saint Georges, where they lived together  for eighteen years, from 1850 to 1868. There Edmond and Jules de  Goncourt first applied principles of symmetry and framing to the interior  decoration.11 The brothers themselves said little about the apartment.  </page> <page sequence="4"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 39  No photographs of it exist, and few visitors recorded their impressions of FIGURE 2  it. There is one valuable visual record, however, in the form of a Jules de Goncourt, La Salle à manger de la  watercolor by Jules that shows a wall of the dining room (Fig. 2).

For this  reason, it merits special attention.  The watercolor shows a now-lost Louis XV Aubusson tapestry hung  prominently on the wall; it depicts a pastoral scene after drawings by  Nicolas Le Prince and Jean-Baptiste Huet.12 Two eighteenth-century  drawings with blue mats are recognizable in the upper right corner: on  top, Quatre études d'homme dansant, dont une pour "L'Indifférent" by  Antoine Watteau, and beneath it, Le Serment de Louis XVI by Jean- Michel Moreau le Jeune. Below the drawings, a Louis XVI credenza  displays eighteenth-century porcelain and a statuette, while the stove to  the left holds porcelain pieces set in front of a gilded bronze medallion  bust of Louis XV. Jules's watercolor emphasizes the harmony and contrast  of the pink, blue, and cream colors that dominated the room. They are  present in the tapestry, repeated in the tone of the sanguine drawings  with their blue mats, and brought out again in the choice of a pinkish-red  color for the wall behind the tapestry.  In addition to this play of tonal and coloristic relationships, the  watercolor reveals a decorative strategy that will also dominate the  </page> <page sequence="5"> 40 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Spring-Summer 2008  installation in Auteuil: the creation of panels using framing and symme- try- Panels—subdivided sections of a wall that function as a unit—were  a crucial part of the Goncourts' concept of interior decorating, and also  served as the principle they used to judge other people's interiors. As  early as 1857, while still living in the rue Saint Georges, they briefly  mentioned the lengthy evolution of decorative panels in the Journal13  Rather than a ready-made means of organizing an interior, panels as  understood there require time (ten years in this case) and careful con- sideration to ripen, rarely achieving a state of completion. This idea set  the Goncourts' aesthetic apart from the increasingly formulaic approach  to interior decorating as marketed to a wide public through pattern books  and interior design manuals. Edmond stressed the slow emergence of  panels when he further defined the term in 1884:  People don't know the happiness that comes to a furniture lover  from composing apartment panels on which materials and colors  harmonize or contrast, from creating some kind of large artistic  tableaux where one associates bronze, porcelain, lacquer, jade, em- broidery. People have no idea how much time it takes in order to be  completely satisfied, the changes and displacements that it re- quires.14  Goncourt's slowly evolving attitude stood in clear contrast to the easy  promises of decorating manuals such as Charles Blanc's 1886 Grammaire  des arts décoratifs, which offered readers five "general rules" that could be  applied to the decoration of a person, a house, or a place of worship.15  Henry Havard, on the other hand, assured readers of his popular book  L'Art dans la maison (1882) that they could easily learn the principles of  decorating, even in the confusion of late nineteenth-century eclecti- cism.16 Edmond de Goncourt, by contrast, defined the work of interior  design artistically. In the composing of panels, he acted as an artist and  used walls as blank canvases on which he slowly explored harmonies of  color and line, thereby justifying the word artiste in his book La Maison  d'un artiste. The house was not merely the home of the artist: it was part  of his creation, and Edmond's perpetual dissatisfaction and constant  rearranging set him apart from the crowd, which sought pleasing results  in a short time.  The Goncourts subjected the decorative panels of their Parisian  apartment to pictorial principles of harmony and contrast, creating an  arrangement meant to have a strong visual impact experienced before  the appreciation of individual objects. Within the panels, the decorative  principles of symmetry, framing, and contrast govern each composition.  </page> <page sequence="6"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 41  Jules's watercolor shows how they framed the large tapestry at the center  with two vertical panels of matching width. The height of the stove on  the left exactly matches that of the commode on the right, creating a  strong horizontal line, and each surface features artworks arranged in  symmetrical groups of three, where two identical objects frame and set off  a centerpiece. The symmetrical placement of objects against these flat  surfaces repeats at a smaller scale the basic symmetrical pattern of the  entire wall. The overall function of the panel was to highlight the  obviously important pastoral tapestry, which becomes the centerpiece of  this display.  The classical conception of symmetry derives from Greek architec- tural theories of harmony and proportion. The orderly and coherent  distribution of parts around a central axis reflects the divine symmetry of  the human body, with mirroring parts (eyes, ears, hands, feet), organized  around a central axis (forehead, nose, neck, torso).17 Nineteenth-century  writers, including Charles Blanc and Henry Havard, frequently noted  this anthropomorphic character.18 Extended into the realm of interior  decoration, symmetry provides a means of creating a sense of order that  corresponds with what Ernst Gombrich refers to as the "human psycho- logical demand for alignment."19  The Goncourt brothers' use of symmetry seems, however, to be of a  slightly different order. Panels placed in symmetrical arrangements gen- erally act as frames, drawing the eye to the piece placed on the center  axis. They establish a pattern of regularity disrupted by the highlighted  central object, which calls visual attention to itself by virtue of its  placement and size. Jules's watercolor, however, suggests that the place- ment of objects within the framing panels subtly contrasts with the  overall symmetry of the wall. Note that the bust of Louis XV and the  spout of the pitcher both point away from the tapestry, providing an  opening onto the broader expanse of the wall and the objects it displays.  This quiet moment of rupture within the symmetrical pattern prevents  the arrangement from becoming claustrophobic. The scene of the tap- estry is already contained within its own decorative frame, after all, and  if all of the decorative elements around it merely pointed to it, the  tapestry might seem imprisoned within an overly contained environ- ment. Turning these two framing pieces away from the tapestry keeps the  viewer's gaze alerted to the other aesthetic sensations available in the  objects displayed. While certainly highlighting the importance of the  tapestry, the arrangement here also refuses to close in on it and render it  the only point of contemplation. Each object both holds its own and  simultaneously functions as part of a larger whole. There is a sense of  </page> <page sequence="7"> 42 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Spring-Summer 2008  FIGURE 3 order, certainly, but only to a point. The Goncourts avoid rigidity, which  Fernand Lochard, La Maison des Goncourt might have foreclosed the impression of lively aesthetic engagement with  à Auteuil, 53 blvd de Montmorency, June  a variety of pieces.  1886, photograph on albumen paper. BNF,  Dépt. des Estampes. Throughout the Journal and La Maison, Goncourt emphasized that  he collected for the artistic principles embedded in each piece, as  opposed to other collectors who have merely monetary concerns.20 The  task of the interior arrangement is to display both the beauty and  uniqueness of each piece and the visual coherence of the collection as an  ensemble. The walls of the Goncourts' rue Saint Georges apartment can  be seen to stage both individual objects and the collection in a coordi- nated aesthetic experience. Therefore, when the brothers moved to  Auteuil in 1868, they must have gone with a strong notion of the  aesthetics of display already in place.  </page> <page sequence="8"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 43  A New House in Auteuil  As Paul Hadol's caricature implies (Fig. 1), the Goncourts' reputa- tion as collectors of eighteenth-century art was well established in 1868,  when the brothers purchased the Villa Montmorency in the suburb of  Auteuil west of Paris (Fig. 3).21 Moving to a freestanding, single-family  house as the Goncourts did was a socially significant step at a time when  the vast majority of Parisians lived in apartments.22 To pay for the new  residence, the brothers sold some family property in eastern France,  spending an impressive 83,000 francs for the house, which had been built  during the reign of Louis-Philippe.23 They moved into the house on  September 16, 1868, and related their pleasure in decorating it in the  Journal:  Fifteen days spent arranging this house . . . in the dream of discov- eries to decorate it, to dress it up with art, in the joy of your eyes to  rediscover how its daylight illuminates and transfigures everything  that you have brought to it in terms of drawings, terracottas,  tapestries, [and] bronzes.24  The choice of a villa in Auteuil was surely not coincidental, because the  town had a reputation as a literary suburb, where three eighteenth- century authors much admired by the Goncourts had lived: Pierre de  Marivaux, Jean d'Alembert, and Denis Diderot. Moreover, the Maréchal  de Luxembourg, to whom the Goncourts dedicated an essay in their 1858  book Portraits intimes, once owned the property that became the site for  the 1830s housing development of which the villa was a part. The town  had an artistic reputation as well, as the painters François Gérard and  Anne-Louis Girodet-Trioson were also residents.25 Paul Gavarni, an  artist and close friend of the brothers, lived and worked in Auteuil as  well, and they were frequent visitors to him until his death in 1866.26  Once they were settled in Auteuil, the reputation of the Goncourts'  house-museum grew. Friends and acquaintances made special trips to  visit, intrepid tourists tramped into the garden and snooped in windows,  strangers wrote for permission to stop by, and reporters published news- paper and magazine articles about it.27 Jules's early death in 1870, not  two years after their move to Auteuil, gave a certain memorial function  to these pilgrimages. Clearly, the bereaved Edmond and his house fasci- nated his contemporaries. The photographs in Edmond's photo album,  all taken after Jules's death, document the way the rooms were laid out  and permit an analysis of the decorating principles Edmond used in  creating his interior.  </page> <page sequence="9"> 44 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Spring-Summer 2008  Symmetry at the House in Auteuil  As seen in Jules's watercolor, the symmetrical arrangement of ob- jects on the walls and flat surfaces of the Goncourts' Parisian dining room  reveals their desire to highlight key objects in their collection (Fig. 2).  Edmond extended this concern to the displays at the Auteuil house.  Symmetry was already a part of the architectural brief of the building, as  both the street and garden façades feature a three-bay design (Fig. 3).  Goncourt, however, even created symmetry where it did not exist,  framing a lone side doorway with large stone terms (Fig. 4). On the  interior, he used symmetrical arrangements to highlight the architectural  elements of the house, as in the grand salon (Fig. 5), where two matching  Beauvais-upholstered chairs frame the central fireplace. These chairs in  turn anchor vertical panels that feature two small drawings sandwiched  between the chairs and larger drawings in matching frames above. The  symmetrical patterning continues at a smaller scale on the mantel, where  a statuette by Claude Clodion is centered between two terracotta vases,  also by Clodion, on either side. A self-referential geometric grid results  from such arrangements, with objects participating simultaneously in  multiple symmetrical systems.  Goncourt's use of symmetry underscores the aesthetic priority of his  decorating principles. More than mere commodious places for living,  these rooms stage visual encounters with beautiful and refined objects.  Many of the Goncourts' contemporaries disdained the use of symmetry in  interior decorating, but the reasons they gave for their rejection of it were  social rather than aesthetic. The comtesse de Bassanville opposed it  because she felt it stanched conversation.28 Charles Blanc, who permit- ted symmetry in formal receiving rooms, where it could calm visitors  escaping the chaos and disorder of the city, advised against it in studies  or conversation alcoves because, he claimed, the order tended to kill  creativity and free thinking.29 Henry Havard, returning to the biological  analogy with the body's exterior symmetry, argued that our innards are  not symmetrical (only one heart, one stomach, one liver, etc.), and  therefore, when applied to the interior of the home, symmetry would  "unnecessarily complicate the functions of life."30  Here, one of the most important differences between Edmond's  aestheticizing approach and the practically oriented advice of his con- temporaries appears in high relief. For Goncourt, the artist's house should  at all times put visual experiences and harmonies above the simple needs  of the body or society. For this reason, even the Auteuil bathroom,  photographed by Joseph Primoli in 1891, was highly decorated and  </page> <page sequence="10"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 45  merited a chapter in La Maison d'un artiste.31 The contemplation of a  colorful print or a sliver of pottery "tickles, brightens, and reflects light"  during the "boring operations" of daily hygiene.32 Goncourt stressed here  that this pleasure was "particular to my nature," underscoring his desire  to use the aesthetic impulse as something that set him apart from his  contemporaries.  Symmetrical arrangements assist in aesthetic contemplation by gen- erating a centripetal movement in the eye, contracting the viewer's field  of vision. The gaze is drawn into the center because symmetry visually  emphasizes the element placed on the center axis. Moreover, the gradual  reduction of scale in groupings of three objects where the centerpiece is  smaller than its framing elements contributes to a contraction of the field  of vision, rather than expansion. This is visible in the grand salon (Fig. 5),  FIGURE 4  Fernand Lochard, Porte de service sur l'allée  de la grille à Auteuil, May 1886, photograph  on albumen paper.

The Clodion figurine on the  mantel is also smaller than the vases at either side. Goncourt used this  principle to accent certain cherished artworks, carrying the visitor's  attention from large expanses into increasingly smaller, restricted zones,  within which the eye adjusts to explore and appreciate the aesthetic  details of the highlighted object.  Consider, for example, the heart of the symmetrical arrangements on  FIGURE 5 the grand salon wall, where Edmond placed an Asian bronze swan on the  Fernand Lochard, Grand salon de la maison  d'Auteuil—Panneau de la glace sans tain, floor in front of a Japanese fireplace screen.

Once attention has been focused on the swan,  the serpentine play between the bird's long, curving neck and the  similarly sinuous line of the twisting trunk of the bush on the fireplace  screen emerges for appreciation, carrying the eye from three dimensions  back to two. These lines writhe, as it were, within their symmetrical  frame, providing the type of visual stimulation that so appealed to  Edmond. Discovering these visual affinities and putting them into play FIGURE 6  Fernand Lochard, Grand salon de la maison  contributed to his pleasure in collecting and decorating. d'Auteuil—Panneau de fond, July 1883,  Edmond also used symmetry as a guiding principle in the placement photograph on albumen paper.

Ernst Gombrich  has called such a hanging "decorative," in that individual works are  subordinated to a decorative pattern imposed on them.33 On the lower  tier, the upper edges of the mats are aligned, since the decorative frame  of the large central drawing impedes an easy alignment using the frames.  The upper row of drawings rests on an imaginary horizontal line that  aligns the bottom edges of the frames. The space between the framed  drawings is also carefully measured, and the slightly smaller Moreau le  Jeune of the upper tier is self-consciously centered over the larger  drawing beneath it. Such symmetrical arrangements, with correspon- dence and equal distribution of parts around a dividing line or center,  emphasize the relationships between the individual objects of the col- lection, which are displayed in relation as part of a whole rather than as  isolated objects.34  The concern for symmetry and its tendency to draw the eye inward  registers strongly in the photographs, but is rarely felt in Edmond's verbal  descriptions in La Maison. In analyzing a panel, he tends to describe the  central object of an arrangement first, followed by the successive layers of  framing objects, embedding within the text a centrifugal movement from  center outward that directly contradicts the centripetal path the eye  enacts on encountering symmetrical arrangements in the house.35 If the  reader of the book moves from center to periphery, the visitor to the  house had a visual experience that moved in the opposite direction, as  the visual function of the displays was one of framing and focusing  attention on highlighted objects. Without study of the photographs, it is  impossible to judge how these features of Edmond de Goncourt's interior  participate in his larger aesthetic project. The final element of his design  principles—contrast—gains strength when viewed in the context of  these carefully thought-out symmetrical frames, which dramatize the  visual qualities of the objects on display.  The Role of Visual Contrasts  Embedded within the decorative, symmetrical arrangement of mats  and frames, aesthetic relationships based on contrasts in the drawings  themselves create visual interest. This can be seen in a number of  examples, but nowhere more obviously than in the organization of  drawings on the back wall of the grand salon (Fig. 6). On the lower level,  Edmond hung (from left to right) Jean-Baptiste Greuze's )eune femme au  seuil d'une porte, Jean Moreau le Jeune's La Revue du roi à la plaine de  Sablons, and Hubert Gravelot's L' Entretien galant The upper row featured  </page> <page sequence="14"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 49  a now-lost gouache by Jean-Guillaume Moitte, Moreau le Jeune's Serment  de Louis XVI, and Jean-Baptiste Huet's pastel Line bergère?6 With this  arrangement, Goncourt put multiple contrasts into play: large versus  small drawings, crowds versus single figures, and tiny people who appear  minuscule versus large bodies that fill or even surpass the page.  The contrast between the grand scale of Moreau's large drawings of  public events, filled with hundreds if not thousands of miniature people,  and the smaller sheets featuring large single figures in intimate settings  causes the individual features of each to stand out. Moreau's small,  densely crowded figures merge in vast expanses of space in the two  central works, whereas the framing drawings expand the scale of the  figures, at the same time reducing the perceived size of the piece of  paper.37 The outer drawings, in their symmetrical function as frames,  focus the visitor's eye on the Moreau in the center, but, once drawn  there, the retina needs to expand to take in its small details. The  arrangement thus sets in motion a sort of optical dance that has the  potential to enchant and thereby induce Goncourt's desired state of  reverie.  The relationship between objects is not always one of formal con- trasts, however. Indeed, Edmond often paired French and Asian objects  with an eye to the formal and material qualities they have in common,  finding aesthetic affinities where the less sensitive viewer, blocked by a  cultural assumption of difference, would not be able to observe such  nuances. In the cabinet de travail, Edmond admired the way the flesh  tones of a Mayence statuette "stand out, palely pinker, against the light  blue of a long and slender turquoise vase, placing on top of this piece of  furniture, struck by light all day long, the icy opposition and accord of  two of the most tender porcelain colorings from the West and the Far  East."38 The reverberation between opposition and accord creates what  might be called a vibrational aesthetic, where objects hovered in delicate  relationships based on subtle harmonies of hue or line.39  Edmond de Goncourt's taste for the aesthetic frisson that resulted  from unconventional but aesthetically pleasing pairings led him con- stantly to undermine the organizational logic of the house as declared in  the table of contents of La Maison d'un artiste. The book suggests that the  collections were divided into rooms according to media and epoch. Thus  the dining room displayed their collection of eighteenth-century bronzes,  the petit salon the eighteenth-century drawings, the cabinet de toilette the  Saxony and Sèvres porcelains, and the cabinet de l'Extrême-Orient the  collections of Chinese and Japanese art. In this organization, Edmond  </page> <page sequence="15"> 50 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Spring-Summer 2008  imitated contemporary museology, which arranged collections quasi- scientifically according to place of origin and medium, like species.40  The photographs make clear, however, that every room, in spite of  its titular function of holding one type of art object (eighteenth-century  drawings in the petit salon, for example), featured one or more comple- mentary pieces from other parts of their collections. The table of con- tents announces that the grand salon holds "the Clodions, the Beauvais  and Gobelins tapestries, the Marie-Antoinette furniture, [and] the Sevres  vases." Edmond, however, signaled the presence of another object in the  room that fit none of these categories: a Japanese bronze basin over one  meter tall: "Among all of these eighteenth-century objects, in all of this  prettiness, I thought it was a good idea to have an important piece of Far  Eastern art introduce, as a contrast, its originality and its force."41 The  basin, somewhat surprisingly, does not appear in any of the photographs  of the Auteuil house, but the painter Jean-François Raffaelli included it  in his larger than life-sized portrait of Edmond, exhibited at the Salon of  1883 (Fig. 7). Edmond leans against the large black basin, its curvilinear  base echoing the sinuous lines of the Beauvais-upholstered armchair  placed in front of it. Japanese and French, large and small, bronze and  wood, black and gold: all of these contrasts are united and controlled by  the objects' proximity, which brings out their underlying formal similar- ities.42 The opposition between the pretty and the strong created by this  pairing allowed for a greater appreciation of the characteristics of both,  their traits enhanced by their display in relationship to one another.  Raffaelli's painting is also one of the rare representations of the color  scheme of the walls in the house. They too were subject to the principle  of contrast. The red, black-framed walls of the grand and petit salons (Fig.  8) were a particularly important element in Edmond's decorating theory,  as he commented in La Maison:  For my new small salon, I sought the way to make . . . drawings  mounted in blue, stand out as best as possible. . . . After thinking  about it for a long time, . . . I came to the conclusion that there was  only matte red and glossy black to show off the old master drawings  to an advantage. . . . I even risked a red ceiling—an audacity!—but  which rewarded me and which, in the complete enveloping of the  drawings in a unified and warm coloring, made the whites and all  the milky clarities that a plaster ceiling kills stand out.43  Not only do the red and black contrast with each other in their hue,  value, and surface (matte vs. glossy), but they also contrast with the  drawings on white paper and their blue mats. This family of contrasts  </page> <page sequence="16"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 51  FIGURE 7  Jean-François Raffaelli, Edmond de  Goncourt, 1888. Oil on canvas, 261 ×  171.5 cm.

The overall function of a deco- ration, Edmond argued here in this crucial passage, is to make the  collections it contains stand out, to bring out, highlight, and show off to  an advantage their subtle aesthetic qualities. Rooms thus disposed were  spaces of aesthetic contemplation and sensation rather than mere back- </page> <page sequence="17"> 52 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Spring-Summer 2008  FIGURE 8  Fernand Lochard, Petit salon de la maison  d'Auteuil, July 1883, photograph on  albumen paper.

Indeed, one of the more striking  features of La Maison d'un artiste is the near total absence of daily life in  the descriptions: conversations, meals, visits with friends, and the like  play little part.  A symmetrical hanging based on aesthetic contrasts therefore allows  the features of each element to attract the eye momentarily before  dissolving back into the surroundings. The lively optical motion that  results from the artful placement of objects seems geared to facilitate  multiple contractions and expansions of the gaze as it moves across a  visual field. Edmond de Goncourt's interior design strategy was one of  framing and enveloping works of art in such a way as to maximize this  visual play and lengthen the possibilities of optical pleasure and engage- ment for the sensitive viewer. The constant fluctuations among relation- </page> <page sequence="18"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 53  ships of symmetry, similarity, and contrast create a dense network of  aesthetic relationships. While the interiors themselves have long been  dismantled, the photographs serve as partial visual witnesses to this  complex system, which is only partly accounted for in Edmond's lengthy  book.44 Frustrating in their lack of color, Lochard's photographs none- theless allow a deeper understanding of Goncourt's interiors and the  aesthetic coherence that governed the decoration of the entire house.  Care must be taken, however, to recall that the photographs freeze  into a fixed image a decorative arrangement that was in constant fluc- tuation. Compare the mantel decoration in Figures 10 and 11. While the  central object is washed out in the overexposed glare of Figure 11, the  vase to the left has clearly been changed. Edmond de Goncourt often  mentioned his pleasure in moving and rearranging objects in the house.45  The slow transformation of the decorative ensembles means that the  interiors were in a perpetual state of flux, and that the symmetrical  arrangements analyzed here were only temporary. The photographs hint  at the shifting symmetrical patterns, which fragment, expand, and con- tract as discussed in relation to the arrangements in the grand salon. This  visual movement recalls the play of patterns in kaleidoscopes, which in  fact can serve as an excellent metaphor for the house in general. Derived  from the Greek kalos (beauty) + eidos (image) + skopeo (I see), the  kaleidoscope was described in nineteenth-century dictionaries as "a phys- ical instrument formed by an opaque tube containing mirrors arranged in  such a way so that small colored objects contained in the tube produce  agreeable designs with infinite variations; . . . an object that embellishes,  that makes things visible in an agreeable way."46 The action of slowly  turning the cylinder provokes endless possibilities of combination and  reformulation, where forms emerge into prominence momentarily and  then dissolve. Rather than creating rigidly ordered systems, it seems that  the symmetry of the Goncourts' interior remained open to new possibil- ities through shifting patterns of light, color, and object placement. This  sense of emergence and absorption of visual elements corresponds to  Edmond's definition of the slowly evolving decorative panel, each suc- cessive articulation of which acts as a temporary visual constellation of  certain formal elements of line and color. Each subsequent arrangement  is yet another "agreeable design" in the "infinite variations" that the  house and its collections embody. It is in the way that the decorative  arrangements "make visible" that the house cum kaleidoscope displays  the richness of aesthetic possibilities contained within the collection.

The Question of Period Style  Further study of the photographs can also help put to rest the  lingering notion that Edmond de Goncourt recreated eighteenth-century  interior aesthetics in his house. The photographs prove to be all the more  important for understanding his interiors given his decision to have the  entire collection auctioned at his death, a choice that aroused contro- versy at the time and that still hampers research. Because the actual  interiors are gone, scholars have tended to focus solely on the descrip- tions of La Maison d'un artiste, ignoring the additional evidence con- tained in the photographs.47 In spite of its fame during Edmond's life- time, the house, like much of the brothers' oeuvre, has fallen into a  confused state of misunderstanding. This state evolved partly as a rejec- tion of the Goncourts' reactionary social politics and what were seen as  their retardataire aesthetic positions, which sometimes opposed those  enshrined by later generations of art historians.48 Modernist scholars  have tended to exaggerate the Goncourts' turn to the past in order to use  them as figures who fully rejected the present. When applied to the  Goncourts' residence, this line of thinking interprets the house as a  reconstruction of an eighteenth-century interior.49  The efficiency of this reasoning lies in its vagueness. What period of  the eighteenth century did the Goncourts supposedly recreate? An early  Rococo interior or a later Louis XVI interior? Comparisons between  preserved eighteenth-century interiors and the photographs of the rooms  in the Auteuil house provide ample differences to help negate the idea.  Most eighteenth-century interiors, which are known for the use of  expanses of light colors, multiple mirrors, gilding, irregularly shaped  panels, and asymmetrical decorative motifs, do not employ the decorat- ing features visible in Edmond de Goncourt's rooms. His small fortune  did not permit the luxury of acquiring entire historical schemes to  re-install in the Auteuil home. Moreover, his use of framed drawings as  a primary decorating element knows few eighteenth-century precedents.50  The dark red and black color scheme of Edmond's walls also contrasted  sharply with the light and airy effect of earlier rooms, and was designed  to make certain objects in the room stand out rather than blend in.  It is this use of symmetry and color contrasts to highlight specific  objects in the collection that ultimately seems furthest from eighteenth- century decorative harmonies, in which every aspect of a room's deco- </page> <page sequence="20"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 55  ration blends to create a unified aesthetic experience. Rather than  generate an overall sensuous effect, Edmond staged a series of aestheti- cized encounters with cherished objects. Avoiding the Rococo tendency  toward asymmetry in his decorative arrangements, he permitted complex  visual nuances to emerge for contemplation and appreciation. Viewers  may indeed acquire a greater understanding of and admiration for the  fine and decorative arts of the French Rococo, but Edmond did not lead  them to that conclusion by imitating or recreating Rococo decorating  patterns. Rather, he sought the best installation possible to make beloved  features stand out.  The concept of period rooms, where historical imitation governs an  ensemble of authentic elements, such as paintings, sculptures, and tap- estries matched stylistically to furnishings such as chairs, desks, tables,  wall paneling, and carpets from the same period, did not really emerge  until a generation after Edmond de Goncourt's book.51 Period rooms,  stressing historical authenticity, go beyond the mere accumulation of  objects from a single period. Designers of them take the further step of  arranging those items in a manner that mimics the presumed appearance  of rooms from the period in question, using prints, paintings, and other  visual representations as documentary evidence for the distribution of art  and furniture within a room. Edmond de Goncourt did this kind of  reconstruction work in his history books, especially in La Femme au  dix-huitième siècle (1862, with Jules de Goncourt), but such was not his  concern at his home in Auteuil.  As a comparative example, the early twentieth-century home of the  avid Rococo collector Moïse de Camondo (18604935) matches the  appearance of late eighteenth-century interiors to a much greater extent.  Having set as his goal the reconstitution of the ideal eighteenth-century  home, Camondo recreated an eighteenth-century-style set of panels to  frame his suite of decorative paintings by Jean-Baptiste Huet; and in his  Salon des Huet, the large paintings and gilded mirrors were installed into  these carved wooden panels copied from the Hotel Jean du Barry, of  about 1775, in Toulouse.52 In the grand bureau (Fig. 9) he installed an  authentic set of wooden panels purchased in 1911, outfitting them with  Aubusson tapestries and more Rococo mirrors.  For the creation of these rooms, Camondo benefited from a number  of factors that distinguished his activities from those of Edmond de  Goncourt. First, he inherited a great deal of the collection from his  father, Nissim de Camondo. The family's immense fortune far surpassed  Goncourt's buying power and permitted Moïse to purchase entire suites  of large paintings, huge eighteenth-century carpets and tapestries, and  </page> <page sequence="21"> 56 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Spring-Summer 2008  hundreds of objets d'art by the finest artists. Moreover, Moïse hired a team  of educated consultants for his project, including the architect Rene  Sergent, famous for his knowledge of the eighteenth-century architect  Ange-Jacques Gabriel His team of consultants assisted in the research  and installation of the collection in spaces specifically designed in a  historicist manner. The Camondo interiors doubtless benefited from the  Goncourt brothers' own publications on eighteenth-century life and art.  The Goncourts, on the other hand, disposed of smaller means and  had to arrange their collections within a house with July Monarchy  stylistic elements. (Camondo built his house from scratch, in late eigh- teenth-century Neoclassical style.) Telling details in the Auteuil resi- dence betray the absence of a period room mentality. Tapestries, which  themselves included elaborate framing devices of floral garlands, ribbons,  or trompe-l'oeil curtains surrounding a central scene, were cut down to fit  around doors and mirrors (Fig. 10), leaving garlands that loop into an  open door, rather than back into a central gathering point, and figures  awkwardly squeezed into tight spaces. The wooden frames for tapestry  panels seen in the Camondo interiors were absent from Goncourt's  smaller rooms. Furthermore, Goncourt violated the pictorial field of at  least one tapestry, in the dining room, by putting a clock in the middle  of it and by installing a pair of sconces on it at either side of the central  panel, which could not have been done without cutting holes in the  tapestry (Fig. 11, note that the tapestry here is the same one seen in the  watercolor in Fig. 2, but there without the two narrow side panels).53  Edmond's rooms were simply too small for the grandeur of the works he  displayed there, creating a sense of containment and enclosure that was  not part of the airy and open eighteenth-century aesthetic.  Other details, such as Goncourt's systematic placement of numerous  small statuettes, vases, and other objects on shelves further contributed  to a nineteenth-century sense of crowding, and the dark red and black  walls of the large and small salons visible in Raffaelli's painting (Fig. 7)  had no equivalent in the eighteenth century. Indeed, Edmond's one  clearly articulated rule about interior decorating contradicted the stylis- tic brief of the Rococo:  At the heart of things, let's pose in principle that the only harmo- nious apartment is one in which the pieces of furniture stand out in  contrast and in opposition to two largely dominant tonalities, and  red and black are still the most pleasing combination that a deco- rator has found as a repoussoir to bring out the value of that which  furnishes a room.54  </page> <page sequence="22"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 57  FIGURE 9  René Sergent, architect, townhouse for  Moïse de Camondo, Grand bureau, 1910- 1914, Paris.

This passage reveals that, for Edmond de Goncourt, the collections of  drawings and furniture remain distinct from the room that surrounds  them. He does not pursue the fusion of interior elements that marked  Rococo interiors and that would transform later Art Nouveau interiors,  for example, into environments of seamless, all-over ornament. The  primary concern of Edmond's interior design was to create the most  beautiful setting possible for his collections, particularly his eighteenth- century drawings. The aesthetics of framing and contrast were his mo- tivating forces, not historical accuracy or recreation. While it may be  </page> <page sequence="23"> 58 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Spring-Summer 2008  FIGURE 10  Fernand Lochard, Salle à manger de la  Maison des Goncourt à Auteuil, July 1883,  photograph on albumen paper.

It was a fully nineteenth-century product, a three-dimensional  montage that expressed Edmond's taste for contrasts emphasizing the  material qualities of the pieces in his collections of French and Asian art  and heightening the aesthetic experience. Even as he insisted on the  ontological separation of the collection from its envelope, Edmond  demanded that the envelope perform a function: to highlight, to en- hance, and to make more beautiful the objects it enclosed. The collec- tions on their own were not enough for him: he required that the  conditions of viewing them accentuate their visual and emotional im- </page> <page sequence="24"> Edmond de Goncourt's Aesthetic Interior 59  pact.

This pleasure  was continuous in his activities of arranging and rearranging displays  using the principles analyzed here.  In creating his interior decor, Edmond metaphorically enacted the  actions of both the collector and the artist. As a collector perusing the  bouquinistes and antique shops on the quais of the Seine, he was drawn  to certain features in drawings, porcelains, tapestries, and statuettes. As  </page> <page sequence="25"> 60 Studies in the Decorative Arts/Spring-Summer 2008  a decorating artist, he then creatively employed these objects as compo- sitional elements in harmonious ensembles (or "panels") that were gov- erned by the principles of symmetry and contrast. It was the care he  lavished on the thoughtful arrangement of his interiors, in which a  myriad of experiences of aesthetic beauty rotated as in a kaleidoscope,  that made Edmond's home a point of reference for his contemporaries.  His sensitivity to the artistic qualities and craftsmanship of decorative art  objects, combined with the creativity he brought to their framing and  display, inspired others after him to pursue an even greater degree of  decorative integration, either in the historical accuracy of period rooms  or in the modern aesthetics of Art Nouveau.  The photographs collected in Goncourt's private album partially  preserve the visual impact of his interiors, where framing, symmetry, and  contrast represent the criteria used for the installation of his large  collections of French and Asian decorative and fine arts. The photo- graphs, in a curious parallel to Edmond's interiors, make visible the subtle  qualities of display that went unmentioned in La Maison d'un artiste.  Edmond's ongoing desire to publish an illustrated edition suggests that he  understood that it is not enough to read about the artist's house: one has  to see it in order to appreciate it fully.
