THE PURPOSE of this paper is to summarize the develop- ment and experimental validation of a three-dimensional mathematical model of the crash victim, a digital computer simulation recently developed at Cornell Aeronautical Labor- atory, Inc. (CAL)*. Since 1963, CAL has been performing research in digital computer simulation of the crash victim on a continuing basis. Prior to the present effort, these mathematical models were restricted to planar motions, with emphasis placed on frontal collisions. Experience gained in development and successful application of the planar simulations has led to the develop- ment of a three-dimensional crash victim simulation (1, 2)**- *Developed under the joint sponsorship of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Motor Ve- hicle Manufacturers Association. **Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. a continuing research program. This three-dimensional model was motivated by the need for an analytical method to study the highly variable, three-dimensional force environment and responses of the crash victim, such as occur in nonfrontal motor vehicle collisions. To test the assumptions applied in the development of the model, and to verify the logic and techniques used in the com- puter program, a detailed experimental validation of the model has been performed. Predicted responses have been compared with results from a variety of experiments, which included static bench tests to validate the airbag shape algorithm, pendulum drop tests with a dummy form restrained by an airbag, anthropomorphic dummy tests on an impact sled with both belt and airbag restraints, and a full-scale car-to-car crash test with an automobile containing anthropomorphic dum- mies. In the paragraphs that follow, the development of the model and computer program is summarized, followed by a review of the validation study. ABSTRACT A three-dimensional mathematical model of the crash vic- tim has been developed and experimentally validated at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. The digital computer simulation includes a body dynamics model of 40 degrees of freedom and a contact model that generates forces from contact with vehicle surfaces and between body segments of the crash victim, and restraint forces from belts and inflatable restraints. The validity of the computer simulation was determined from comparisons of predicted responses with those measured in various experiments, including static bench tests, pendulum tests, impact sled tests, and a full-scale auto- mobile crash test. Inputs to the computer program were based on detailed measurements of dummy characteristics and measured properties of the contact surfaces and restraints. The generally good agreement between the simulation and experimental results, plus the relatively low cost of exercising the model, demonstrate that the computer program is a useful engineering tool. 2797</page><page sequence="2">2798 J.

The body dynam- ics model, of central importance in the computer program, contains the equations of motion and joint constraint of the dynamic system. These equations were formulated from Euler's equations for a rigid body in a general manner that allows variation in the number of body segments and joints within the formulation, as described in detail in Ref. 1 . In this important respect, the model differs from other three- dimensional crash victim models (3-5), which were formulated in a less flexible manner from Lagrange's equations of motion. As programmed, the body dynamics model consists of 15 rigid-body segments (Fig. 2): the head, neck, three torso seg- ments, eight arm and leg segments, and feet. These are con- nected by 14 joints: two neck joints, two torso joints, and joints at the shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, and ankles. All joints are ball-and-socket type except the elbows and knees, which are pinned. The joints are located arbitrarily, but rigidly, with respect to segment centers of gravity (e.g.). This 15-segmçnt, 14-joint representation results in a dynamic sys- tem with 40 degrees of freedom. Joint torques, simulating muscle tone, consist of viscous, coulomb friction, and spring components, with nonlinear Fig. 2 - Body dynamics model</page><page sequence="3">COMPUTER SIMULATION OF CRASH VICTIM 2799 Fig. 3 - Contact model-graphics display model spring torques serving as joint stops. For the ball-and-socket joints, torsional and flexural spring torques are produced as functions of the torsion and flexure at the joint, whereas for the pinned joints only flexural spring torques are produced. The body contact model (Fig. 3) is defined by an ellipsoidal contact surface corresponding to each body segment. Program routines have been developed to generate contact forces from an ellipsoid contact with a plane, or from contact between two ellipsoids, allowing simulation of a contact between a given body segment and a vehicle contact surface, or between two body segments. Normal contact forces are generated as a function of penetration of contacting surfaces, and sliding friction forces oppose relative motion between surfaces that have contacted. Restraint belt forces are produced on ellipsoidal torso seg- ments by belts that lie in a plane defined by the two belt anchor points and a selected point fixed on a given torso seg- ment. The airbag model includes the gas dynamic deployment, inflation, and deflation processes, modeled with one-dimen- sional ideal gas dynamic equations. The inflated airbag model consists of a locally deformable ellipsoid with perimeter con- straints imposed on the fully inflated bag, which is assumed unstretchable. A "wraparound" algorithm is used to compute local bag shape in the vicinity of contacts, and the resulting contact force. Net forces and moments acting on the bag are computed, and displacement of the bag during its deforma- tion from contact with the crash victim and vehicle surfaces is included in the simulation. The graphics display model, developed as a tool for rapid diagnosis and interpretation of results (Figs. 3 and 4), pro- vides several optional levels of output. In the diagnostic printer graphics display, the locations of the joints and e.g. of each body segment are printed in two orthogonal views as part of the program printout. A plotter graphics display de- veloped as a postprocesser option, produces two orthogonal views of the ellipsoidal contact model, with certain human features and characteristics added to provide more realism and ease of comprehension. The plotter graphics program has been developed for use with the CAL Flying Spot Scanner, to op- tionally generate motion pictures of the simulated crash event from the plotter program from information stored on a mag- netic tape. The injury criteria model, only partially implemented in the computer program at present, is based on the American Medi- cal Assoc.-General Motors Corp. 10-point scale. Injury defi- nition is summarized in tabular form, as illustrated in Table 1, with injury descriptions and the assigned severity code given for the head-and-neck, chest, abdominal region, and the ex- tremities. The computer program is written in FORTRAN IV for use on a digital computer for simplicity of transfer and use at other computing facilities. In the program, 186 simultaneous first- order ordinary differential equations are solved using a vari- able-step exponential integrator developed recently in this research. With this program, a typical cost of simulating a 200 ms crash on the IBM 370/165 digital computer at CAL is about 60 s computer time, or about $50. The program is written in replaceable modular form throughout, to allow changes with minimum effort as, for example, new biome- chanical and human tolerance data become available. Output consists of the printer graphics display, various printed diag- nostic results, and a magnetic tape containing computed re- sults for postprocessing. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION As a means of assessing the assumptions applied in the mod- eling effort, and as a verification of the programming logic and techniques, a validation study has been performed by compar- ing predictions of the mathematical model with a variety of experimental results. Some of these experimental results were obtained as part of the present research effort, while others were taken from documentation of experiments performed in related efforts. This validation effort, described in detail in Ref. 2, will be summarized in this section. These experi- ments included: 1 .

Although all experimental results have been useful in estab- lishing model validity, for the sake of conciseness, only the most critical of these validation tests will be discussed in this section. To perform computer simulations of these tests, the re- quired inputs to the computer program were either measured or obtained from documentation of experiments performed on related projects. The measurement effort consisted pri- marily of measurement of dummy characteristics, including inertial data (e.g., segment masses, and principal moments of inertia), link dimensions and contact surface dimensions, static joint torque characteristics, and static force-deflection and frictional characteristics of the dummy contact surfaces. Also, the characteristics of restraint belts, inflatable restraints, and contact surfaces were either measured or obtained from Fig. 8 - Typical force-deflection characteristics of contact surfaces</page><page sequence="8">2804 J. A. BARTZ Fig. 9 - Initial conditions for non- test documentation. All required inputs to the program were therefore based on direct measurement, with the few excep- tions noted in Ref. 2. For example, the viscous torque coeffi- cients of the dummy joints were not measured in this research effort, but estimates of their values were obtained from the quasi-static joint torque measurements. Prior to measurement, the dummy, a 50th percentile Sierra 292-1050, was disassembled into 15 segments corresponding to the 15-segment body dynamics model (Fig. 2). The e.g. of the dummy segments were located by balancing the segments on a knife edge, as illustrated in Fig. 5 A. The segment masses were obtained from weigh scale measurements, and the mo- ments of inertia about the principal axes were determined with a statically calibrated torsional pendulum (Fig. 5C). The moment of inertia of a segment about a given axis is directly related to the increase of the period of the pendulum caused by mounting the segment on the pendulum. The pendulum period was measured with an optical sensor (Fig. 5D). Link dimensions and contact surface dimensions were de- termined with the caliper and scale instruments shown in Fig. 5B. The static joint torque characteristics were obtained by applying known forces with either a spring scale or a me- chanical jack on a known moment arm and determining the torque-angular deflection relationships. A typical torque characteristic is shown in Fig. 6. In reducing such data for input to the computer program, it was found that the assumed functional forms of the torque-deflection relationships in the computer program were adequate in all cases. The static force-deflection characteristics of the dummy contact surfaces were determined by compressing various dummy segments in a hydraulic tester and recording the seg- ment deformation measured with height gages and scales, as a function of applied force (Fig. 7). A typical set of force- deflection characteristics is shown in Fig. 8. In addition, the static friction coefficient of the dummy skin was determined by measuring the horizontal static load required to overcome static friction of the dummy torso on a horizontal surface. Among the various experiments mentioned in this section, some of the impact sled tests performed without airbags are considered to be the most critical means of assessing the model, and they will be discussed first. In these tests, a 50th percen- tile Sierra 292-1050 anthropomorphic dummy was forced into a very general nonplanar motion by locating the dummy and belt anchor points in an unsymmetrical manner on the sled.</page><page sequence="9">COMPUTER SIMULATION OF CRASH VICTIM 2805 anar impact sied tests Three tests were performed with the initial conditions shown in Fig. 9. In the first two of these runs, designed to be iden- tical repeat runs, the dummy was forced into motion with an acceleration pulse that caused a 30 mph final sled velocity in 16 in of displacement. The last run also was identical, except that it was performed at 20 mph to vary experimental param- eters. In the corresponding computer runs, the only change in input was the deceleration history to reflect this difference in speed between the tests. Measurements in the sled tests in- cluded head and chest triaxial accelerations, restraint belt loads, and dummy kinematic responses, obtained with high- speed motion picture coverage. An overall comparison be- tween predicted and measured responses is best obtained by comparing predictions from the plotter graphics display (Fig. 10B) with photographs from the high-speed movie film (Fig. 10A). It can be seen that the predicted kinematic responses are in generally good agreement with the experimental results. The main difference, head rotation, is traceable to the neck belt contacting the rigid dummy chin and rotating the dummy head in the experiment, an effect that was not simulated. A representative comparison with the measured data traces is shown in Fig. 1 1 for the 30 mph test condition. Again, the agreement is generally good, except for a lack of correlation in time during belt unloading. This lack of time correlation during unloading is traceable primarily to hysteresis in the belt material, which was not simulated in the computer pro- gram. In another validation study, the airbag model was tested by comparing force predictions of the model with experiment. The experimental results for this comparison (6) were ob- tained by striking a preinflated, unvented passenger airbag (10 ft^ volume) with a bluff torso form ("Tufy" dummy weighing 86 lb) mounted on a long pendulum arm. The air- bag was supported and reacted by an instrumented rigid planar surface. These experimental results were considered ideal to assess the rather complex airbag shape and contact force algorithm of the airbag model, without the added com- plication of gas dynamic inflation and deflation processes. Results of the comparison are shown in Fig. 12 for two initial torso velocities. In the two computer runs, the only change in input was the initial torso velocity, corresponding to the difference in speed between the two tests. It can be seen that the simulation predicts the reaction panel force to within</page><page sequence="10">2806 J. A. BARTZ Fig. 1 0 - Nonplanar 20 mph test. A - Model variation, about 10% for both cases, resulting in a rather accurate predic- tion of torso kinematics. The difference between the pre- dicted and measured quantities, particularly airbag pressure and torso velocity at the higher impact velocity, is at least partially the result of air leakage from the porous nylon bag in the experiment, as shown in comparisons presented in Ref. 2. It is felt that these favorable comparisons validate the air- bag shape and contact force algorithms of the model in a satisfactory manner. In a more critical assessment of the entire airbag model, predictions of the simulation were compared to 30 mph im- pact sled test results (7). In these tests, a Sierra 292-850 dummy was restrained with both a lap belt and an airbag that was deployed at the start of the sled acceleration pulse (Fig. 13). It should be emphasized that this comparison cannot be considered a validation of the mathematical model in the strictest sense, for the following reason. Although all inputs to the computer program were based on measurements re- ported in Ref. 7, the properties of the 50th percentile Sierra 292-850 dummy tabulated in that reference were not suffi- cient to completely define the simulated three-dimensional crash victim. Consequently, the measured properties of the 50th percentile Sierra 292-1050 dummy were used to input the computer program instead. However, because the differ- ence in properties between these two dummies probably would not have a large effect on predicted responses, the comparison can be considered a reasonable test of validity. A representa- tive comparison is presented in Figs. 14A and 14B*. The two curves labeled "with CT" and "no CT" reflect a difference in allowed torso contacts in the simulation, and indicate that the predicted results are not highly sensitive to the choice of al- *To avoid possible confusion, the data plots given in Ref. 7 were unchanged for this comparison, but the sign of the x component of acceleration was reversed to maintain a con- sistent convention.</page><page sequence="11">COMPUTER SIMULATION OF CRASH VICTIM 2807 B - Simulation of impact sled experiments lowed contacts. (The curve labeled "no CT" corresponds to a computer run in which the center torso segment was ex- cluded from the list of allowed contacts with the airbag.) Except for some lack of time correlation, the results are in reasonable agreement, and add support to the validity of the airbag model. SUMMARY A digital computer simulation of the crash victim has been developed and experimentally validated. The experiments ranged from simple static bench tests and pendulum tests through more complex impact sled tests, some including air- bags, and a full-scale automobile crash test. The representa- tive comparisons presented indicate generally good agreement between the experimental results and predictions of the sim- ulation. This good agreement, plus the relatively low cost of exercising the mathematical model (typically $50 per com- puter run) demonstrate that the computer program is a useful engineering tool. It particularly lends itself to parametric in- vestigations, extrapolation of experimental results, and design of meaningful experiments in crash victim research.
