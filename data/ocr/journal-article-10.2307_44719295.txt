ABSTRACT Although filter class specifications have been defined for most anthropomorphic test devices, no recommendation exists for the instrumented upper extremity. A three-part study was performed to determine the best channel filter class (CFC) to use for the instrumented upper extremity. By analyzing frequency content of signals from accelerometers and load cells, filtering data through three of the four possible CFC's to compare effects on the signals, and performing an injury comparison between cadaver data and the filtered load cell data, CFC 600 was chosen and recommended as the optimum filter class to use for upper extremity testing. INTRODUCTION The recommendations for filter class selection for anthropomorphic test devices are given by SAE J21 1/1 - Instrumentation for Impact Test; however, no recommendation exists for the instrumented upper extremity. The purpose of this work is to determine the best filter class to use for the upper extremity. There are multiple papers and studies with upper extremity testing with a range of filter classes used from CFC 180, 600, to 1000 or no filter at all. [1-4] There can be over 50% difference in the peak of a signal depending on the filter class used. Often the peak of a signal is all that is reported, rendering comparisons virtually meaningless. This makes it very difficult to compare work from different laboratories and makes the process of establishing injury criteria for the upper extremity very difficult. Recommendations for the lower limb exist in SAE J211, however recommendations are noticeably missing for the upper extremity. This is a possible reason for the lack of standardization between different reports. The authors sought to recommend a filter class for the upper limb using a three part approach. The end goal of the study is to recommend a CFC for the upper extremity that will give a better estimate of the true loads and accelerations found during a test, while still maintaining some noise reduction. The end result it is hoped will be the standardization of data and future work done with the upper extremity so as to facilitate comparison between tests to be performed. METHODOLOGY For the lower limb, SAE J211 recommends CFC 600 for forces and moments, CFC 180 for displacements, and has no recommendation for accelerations. The justification for this information officially is minutes of the Safety Test Instrumentation Standards Committee that are no longer available. All minutes of the Safety Test Instrumentation Standards Committee, as well as those of all Committees of SAE, are destroyed after five years and are unavailable to those who might be interested in them. A range of these classes have been used in different studies for the upper limb. However, the frequency spectrum of the data is of interest to determine which filter classes are useful. The frequency spectrum of the unfiltered signals from dummy tests were used to determine a cutoff frequency. In the past, CFC's have been chosen by the Human Biomechanics Safety Subcommittee, and put into the SAE J211/2 standard by the Safety Test Instrumentation Standards Committee. The members of the Human Biomechanics Safety Subcommittee review available cadaver data, and the choice of CFC for a given location on the dummy has been based on spectral analyses of the data. [5] The current study was accomplished in three parts. These parts are intended to outline a standardized approach to determining the CFC to be used for any signal. In the first step, frequency content is determined for some data from tests with instrumented upper extremities. The tests were side airbag deployments with two different bag aggressivities, a high and low. Bags were deployed into the upper extremity, with the hand placed in a door mounted handgrip. The dummies were instrumented with humerus and forearm 1202</page><page sequence="2">accelerometers and load cells. In the first step, Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) are taken of the available data and normalized with respect to the maximum acceleration, load, etc. found in the dataset. An acceptable cutoff frequency Is determined using an approach to be outlined. The data is then filtered in part two using each of three possible CFC's: 180, 600, and 1000 Hz. CFC 60 was not tested, as it is recommended for filtering of sled accelerations, etc and is rarely used for biomechanical testing. The results from filtering data at the CFC of choice (600) are compared to experimental values through cadaver testing. For the cadaver tests, injury analysis was performed using frontal airbag deployments onto cadavers, with five airbag types. Also, peak loads resulting from different levels of filtering in part one are compared to values found using rigid drop tower tests. INSTRUMENTED DUMMY UPPER EXTREMITY TESTING In the first part, two anthropomorphic upper extremities were instrumented with accelerometers and load cells to measure triaxial acceleration, shear, axial force, and bending moments. Two cadaveric upper extremities were also tested for comparison, instrumented only to measure acceleration. (Table 1) Upper extremities were placed in a door-mounted hand grip next to a side airbag. Four tests were run, with two different airbag aggressivities for the two types of upper extremities, dummy and cadaver. Airbag A was high aggressivity, and Airbag C had lower aggressivity. The resulting data is intended to be representative of the characteristics of loading both in terms of acceleration and loads on the upper extremity. Table 1.

For this part, the original signals were analyzed using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to determine frequency content. Data was filtered using the algorithm specified in SAE J211, using a low-pass butterworth filter. The filter algorithm was programmed in Matlab™ (The Mathworks, Natick, MA). J211 provides only information on how to calculate the filter coefficients, and Matlab's filtering algorithm FILTFILT was used to actually perform data filtering. FFTs were normalized based on maximum value, grouped by location (humerus vs. forearm) and type of measurement (accelerometer vs. load cell) and frequency content was compared. The process for normalization consists of searching the dataset from start of airbag deployment (t=0) to the end (zero signal, approximately 300 ms) for the maximum value present in the dataset. The entire dataset is then divided by this maximum value so that the dataset is normalized on a scale from 0 to 1. The value maximum value resulting, 1, corresponds to a magnitude with respect to the peak in the original signal of 0 dB. Data is changed to a scale of dB drop from maximum using Equation (1). As this signal drops off to a tenth of its original strength, for instance, it is at -20 dB. This can be checked by putting -20 dB into Equation (2). dB. 201og,„["%ÄJ (1) Where mag is the magnitude of each datapoint in the set, taken in turn, and magmax is the maximum magnitude in the dataset. Mag = 10 /20 (2) Where mag is the magnitude of each datapoint, and dB is the reading in decibels When looking at the frequency spectrum of a given signal, a 10-20 dB drop in signal strength signifies natural modes that the impact could probably not excite. [5] With this in mind, a -15 dB from maximum 'cutoff was established for the data, corresponding to a drop in signal strength from maxiumum of about 82.2%. This keeps the criteria in the -15 to -20 dB range or lower, a more conservative estimate. FILTERING COMPARISON For a filtering comparison, data was filtered at CFC's 180, 600, and 1000. Filtered data was compared to original data in two ways: appearance of the filtered data and the frequency content of the new signal. INJURY COMPARISON For injury comparison, separate matched dummy and cadaver tests showed average forearm bending failure at 61 N-m when filtered with CFC 600. Three point drop tests with considerably less noise distribution showed average forearm failure at 58 N-m, which shows no appreciable effect from the CFC 600 filtering. Based on these results and the appearance of the filtered data, CFC 600 is recommended for the upper extremity loads, moments, and accelerations. RESULTS FREQUENCY CONTENT OF SIGNALS For the Humerus AX and Forearm AZ (n=4), there is no signal content higher than 600 Hz with magnitude exceeding the -15 dB from maximum. (Figures 1 and 2) This was also found to be the case for the Forearm FZ and the Humerus MY to less than -20 dB (n=2). (Figures 3 and 4) Also of interest is the fact that in all tests performed, frequency content existed above -15 1203</page><page sequence="3">dB at frequencies above 180 dB, ruling out the possibility of using this filter class. This also further justifies the earlier omission of the CFC 60 filter class as a possibility. Using the 1000 Hz filter class would have resulted in underfiltering data. As peak loads are the same using CFC 600, filtering the data to CFC 1000 is undesirable. Figure 1. Humerus Ax Figure 2. Forearm Az Figure 3. Forearm Fz Figure 4. Humerus My FILTERING COMPARISON The data was filtered using each of three Channel Filter Classes specified in J211 (180,600,1000) to qualitatively consider the filtered data. Also, FFT's were performed on the filtered data using the same approach as for the original data. The new FFT plots are shown with the filtered data for comparison. Test number 587 is shown here, with additional tests shown in the Appendix. Filtering results for the 1000 Hz filter differ almost not at all from the original data. The trace filtered to CFC 600 follows the path of the original data closely, with peaks around 270 g's as compared to 310 g's (Figure 5). When the data is filtered to CFC 180, it results in significant reductions in the peak of the signal as well as a significant shift, predominantly apparent in the t=5 ms range of the signal, away from the original start. It moves the time of the peak acceleration back and shifts the acceleration onset time forward. This is unacceptable for test data. In the Appendix, similar trends are evident for all the tests. Figure 5. Filtered Humerus Ax, Test 587 The FFT after filtering for the Humerus Ax shows little perceptible dropoff of the frequency content until around 1500 Hz. This is a common misconception of the CFC or 'cutoff of a filter. A butterworth filter does not cut off frequencies above a specified value like a 'brick wall' filter. Instead, J21 1 specifies a cutoff frequency and then 1204</page><page sequence="4">a 4 dB rolloff frequency, which is the frequency at which the attenuation of the filter has increased by 4 dB from its maximum value in the pass band. (Table 2) This results in a more gradual attenuation of frequencies above the cutoff, apparent in the data filtered for this study. (Figure 6) There is little loss of frequency components of the signal for CFC 600 until about 1500 Hz. This phenomenon is again seen in the additional graphs for all of the tests considered, in the Appendix. Table 2.

FFT post filtering, Humerus Ax Test 587 INJURY COMPARISON For injury comparison, dummy values from the airbag tests were compared at different filter levels with cadaver values from rigid drop tests and impactor tests. Rigid drop tests and impactor tests have considerably less noise contribution, and so the peak loads or accelerations seen during such tests serve as benchmarks when deciding on an appropriate CFC. A forearm bending criteria was established using the injury comparison. The results from the frontal air bag experiments were compared with 3-point drop tests in which fracture of the ulna and radius occurred. The air bag and drop tests resulted in similar fracture patterns, and drop tests were conducted to match the loading rates seen during an airbag deployment with the forearm of the dummy in a worst-case position. The forearm was located centrally over the airbag module with the skin surface of the forearm as close as possible to the airbag module. Using matched dummy and cadaver frontal airbag tests, the small female filtered at CFC 600 gave forearm bending failure at 61 N-m. Three point drop tests from female cadaver tests gave average 5 percentile female failure at 58 N-m. For these tests, there was no appreciable effect of different filter classes on the maximum bending load data, underscoring the assumption that the 3 point drop tests had significantly lower noise than airbag tests. CONCLUSION SAE J211 specifies filter classes for the lower extremity and other dummy locations, however filter class specification is notably missing for the upper extremity. It was found that, when measuring Humerus and Forearm accelerations and forces or moments, the peak frequency content of the resulting signals were reduced by at least 15 or more dB from the maximum amplitude by the time the frequency spectrum reached 600 Hz. This is informative since by the time signal strength drops by 10-20 dB, it specifies natural modes that the impact probably could not excite. This is interpreted to mean that much of the frequency content beyond this range is probably the result of noise. It is therefore concluded that it is safe and appropriate to filter upper extremity data to CFC 600. This conclusion is justified by the frequency content of the original signals, the results of filtering data at a variety of different CFC's, and also the comparison between levels of force at injury. Filtering upper extremity data at CFC 600 results in signal levels that most closely approximate actual levels seen in a test and will therefore give the most accurate picture of loading and risk of injury.
