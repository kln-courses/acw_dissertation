<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  Reviews e Freudian Robot: Digital Media and the Future of the Unconscious. By L H. L. Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press. . xii+  pp. $; £.. ISBN ––––. By highlighting the two parallel and interdependent processes of machines tending towards anthropomorphism and the progressive mechanization of human beings in the modern age, this rich and thought-provoking book eschews the traditional dichotomy ‘human’ versus ‘mechanical’, proposing instead the notion of the ‘Freudian Robot’ as a way of understanding contemporary civilization. is intentionally broad definition encompasses every networked being that embodies what the author calls ‘the feedback loop of human-machine simulacra and [that] cannot free her/him/itself from the cybernetic unconscious’ (p. ). e aim is therefore to bypass both the idea of a competition between humans and machines and the praise of the cyborg as a way of tending towards a transhuman state. e six chapters of the book develop this initial idea, touching several crucial issues of contemporary critical theory. e author enacts a productive dialogue between media studies (Kittler), psychoanalysis (Freud, Jentsch, Jung, Lacan), in- formation theory (Shannon), philosophy and literary theory (Derrida), reassessing in the first place the problem of digital media in the light of the Freudian machine- like structuration of the unconscious and consequently enquiring into the role of Printed English as an allegedly ‘universal’ system that underlies the current Anglo- American intellectual imperialism (Chapters  and ). e book then attempts a reconfiguration of literary modernism in the light of information theory and Derrida’s Of Grammatology, specifically focusing on James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake as a ‘hypermnesiac machine’ that questions the psychical implications of alphabe- tical writing and their reverberations in the unconscious structuration of language (Chapter ). Chapter  argues that the American reception of Jacques Lacan’s works and, more in general, of French theory is affected by significant lacunae and misunderstandings in terms of conceptual definitions and theoretical frames, especially as regards Lacan’s use of mathematical thought, and more specifically of game theory. Chapter  goes to the core of the notion of ‘Freudian Robot’, by re- questioning Sigmund Freud’se Uncanny and its relationship with Ernst Jentsch’s earlier essay on the topic, and therefore reading Freud’s conceptualization of the uncanny as an animate–inanimate (or, as the author puts it, ‘human–automaton’) relationship. is analysis helps in understanding the deep use of the Freudian uncanny by contemporary engineers and cognitive scientists, and is an ideal introduction to the final chapter, where the Freudian Robot is seen as an epitome and figure of social structure in a both digitalized and post-psychoanalytic age. It can thus be said that this book paves the way for a new focus on the osmotic interaction between human beings and machines, providing a challenging contri- bution for an audience widely read in literary theory, media studies, psychoanalysis, and semiotics. By paying attention to apparently indisputable matters of fact in terms of language, writing, media relations, and production of meaning, this work reassesses several conceptual assumptions that are too easily taken for granted, </page> <page sequence="2"> MLR, .,   thus keeping alive the Freudian notion of the ‘unconscious’ as the subterranean and unacknowledged ‘machine’ that becomes evident only through misunderstandings, fractures, and apparently disjointed symptoms. By avoiding both a drastic and ‘apo- calyptic’ opposition between ‘human’ and ‘mechanical’ and a Messianic longing for a transhuman phase of history propitiated by machines, it also proposes an original understanding of the current, posthuman civilization. As the gardener says in the ancient Chinese parable quoted in the introduction, ‘He who does his work in the manner of a machine lets his mind run like a machine.’ Rather than taking this as the symptom of a loss, this book employs the relationship of reciprocity between machines and human mind as a suggestion for opening new fields for enquiry.

ISBN ––––. is volume consists of proceedings from a conference held at the University of Leeds in , that is, on the fortieth anniversary of ‘’. It therefore coincided with a wealth of other publications and forms of reflection on that year, and more importantly, the protest movements associated with it worldwide. is timing permits the editors and international team of authors to reflect on older, recent, and contemporary evaluations and representations of those phenomena, rather than on the events themselves. e aim of the volume is also to provide interdisciplinary, transnational, and other different perspectives on national or regional histories, allowing the reader to understand those histories in broader, comparative ways. e volume contains an introduction by Sarah Waters, followed by five thematically arranged sections. e first, ‘Memories and Places’, is the longest, with six chapters, by Martin Klimke on international trends in the reception of ‘’, Daniel A. Gordon on ‘Reflections of the th Anniversary’ in France, Wolfgang Kraushaar on contemporary controversies around the relationship of the West German protest movements and the Nazi past, John Foot on memories of ‘’ in Italy, Timothy S. Brown on the US, and Claire Brewster on Mexico. Interestingly, these contributions reveal a strikingly diverse pattern of reception across the coun- tries studied. e second section, ‘Personal Testimonies’, contains the reflections of the late Daniel Bensaïd on France; and the third, ‘Marginal Voices’, contributions by Susanne Rinner on recent German fiction, Stuart J. Hilwig on oral history in Italy, and Lan Yang on a new trend in understanding the Chinese Cultural Revolu- tion, long rejected by more recent Chinese government policy but now subject to reassessment in a wealth of Internet publications. In the fourth section, ‘Fictional Imaginaries’, Ingo Cornils addresses German memory culture in the form of four recent memory texts, Irene Fenoglio-Limón considers representations of the Mexi- can ‘’, and Chris Homewood writes on the highly successful German filme Edukators (). A final section, ‘Decentring ’, consists of a chapter by Sofia Serenelli-Messenger on the oral history of a provincial New Le group in Italy. </page> </plain_text>
