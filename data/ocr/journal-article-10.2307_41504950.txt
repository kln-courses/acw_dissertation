The study of early Netherlandish painting has especially benefited from such research.1 Methods of technical exami- nation initially were applied mainly to resolve questions of authenticity, chronology, and attribution. Although these objectives are still of great impor- tance, over the past few decades research has been aimed at obtaining a more general understanding of a broad range of material aspects. Technical studies can provide a fascinating and unique window through time, since we are often allowed to follow the production of a painting through its different stages. In the case of Jan Provoost's Last Judgment (fig. 1) in the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts, X-radiography and infrared reflectography (IRR), aided by recent advances in digital imaging,2 have revealed that the artist painted this panel in an ongoing creative process, since it was intensively reworked through the stages of its production. Numerous compositional changes were found between the underdrawing, the earlier paint layers, and the paint surface. Some of these changes appear to have been the result of Provoost's decision to increase the emphasis on Christ's role as redeemer of humanity, establish a perspective system requiring an intimate viewpoint, and somewhat reduce the frightening nature of the imagery. The significance of other changes, however, is more difficult to understand, and some of these changes remain enigmatic. Jan Provoost (ca. 1465-1529) was born in Mons, a town now in southern Belgium.3 He is assumed to have been trained in Valenciennes by the painter and manuscript illuminator Simon Marmion.4 An important artist in Bruges in the first quarter of the sixteenth century, Provoost held several leading functions in the local painters and saddlers guild.5 His high standing in the Flemish artistic milieu of the time is protably best reflected in the fact that he is documented to have met the illustrious German painter and printmaker Albrecht Diirer at least twice. The artists met first in Antwerp in 1520; the next year they traveled together to Bruges, where Diirer was Provoost's guest. Diirer drew Provoost's portrait on both occasions.6 The group of paintings attributed to Jan Provoost is problematic, since none of the more than one hundred works is signed, only a handful are dated, and some vary greatly in style. A mere two paintings are securely authenticated by documents: the Last Judgment in the Groeningemuseum, Bruges (fig. 4), and the Virgin in the Clouds in the Hermitage, Saint Petersburg.7 Based on stylistic comparison with these two late works (painted between approximately 1523 and 1525), George Hulin de Loo and Max J. Friedlander reconstructed a complete body of work for Provoost in the first decades of this century.8 Other panel paintings, manuscript illuminations, and works on canvas were later added to the group as well.9 Since 1934, when Friedlander published his fundamental essay on the artist, the group has enjoyed little scholarly attention.10 The stylistic variety within the group is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that some paintings were earlier attributed to Dutch, German, and Italian masters.11 In fact, the Detroit Last Judgment, which was one of the very first early Netherlandish paintings to enter an American public collection, was sold in 1883 as a work by Hieronymus Bosch.12 Especially in the study of problematic bodies of work such as the Provoost group, findings from technical examina- tions are of utmost importance. Since 1985, more than forty paintings attrib- uted to Provoost have been studied with IRR, X-radiography, and other methods of technical examination.13 The initial results of this study suggest that these paintings form a more homogeneous group than was hitherto assumed. A relatively large number of Hulin de Loo's and Friedlander's attributions are now supported by the findings of the examinations with IRR. Recent technical studies also upheld Hulin de Loo's attribution of a relatively early work, the Last Judgment in the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Massachusetts (fig. 2). Moreover, dendrochronological analyses of panels attributed to Provoost by Peter Klein of the University of Hamburg have provided a more detailed chronology within the group.14 Throughout his prolific career, Provoost painted a number of different versions of the Last Judgment. Depictions of the Last Judgment are pictorial rendi- 67</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Jan Provoost, The Last Judgment ; oak panel, 108 x 97 cm (42V2 x 38 V4 in.), with original frame.

According to art historian Craig Harbison, "the Last Judgment in the simplest sense deals with the Christian notion that at the end of time Jesus Christ will appear again to men on earth, this time to act as judge over the living and the dead."15 For many, the notion of the Last Judgment has now become more or less of an abstraction. For Provoost's contemporaries, however, the vision of Christ's forthcoming judgment of whether they were to go to heaven, purgatory, or even hell, must have been an absolute and awesome reality. Although numerous earlier depictions of the Last Judgment are known, the subject became a popular image in the sixteenth century. Visual representations of the Last Judgment usually follow a rather rigid compositional scheme, although the images vary strongly in complexity and the number of figures. The composition is often divided into a heavenly and a worldly zone, sometimes separated by clouds. Christ traditionally is placed centrally in heaven, sitting on an orb and/or rainbow. He is usually flanked to his right by his mother, the Virgin Mary, and to his left by his cousin, Saint John the Baptist, both of whom act as mediators for the prayers of the mortals in the lower, worldly zone. Prophets, apostles, angels, or saints are sometimes also present in the upper half of the composition. Saint Michael the archangel is often painted in the worldly zone, weighing the souls of the mortals or fighting the forces of evil. The gates of heaven and the mouth of hell, the final outcomes of the Last Judgment, also are depicted regularly in the lower left and right corners of the image, respectively. In Harbison's words, artists "could through a representation of the last judgment give a rather full account of their own religious world view."16 In general, Provoost's various renderings of the narrative are characterized by an emphasis on humanity's redemption and salvation rather than on a final judgment of condemnation. In the Cambridge panel, thought to be the earliest version, heaven and hell are omitted altogether (fig. 2). One is tempted to read an eschatological optimism into the Detroit panel, where large numbers of blessed enter heaven, and only a very small number of figures are depicted in hell. The four surviving examples painted by Provoost are now, in likely chronological order of production, in Cambridge (fig. 2); the Kunsthalle, Hamburg (fig. 3); Detroit (fig. 1); and Bruges (fig. 4). 17 The Detroit version is one of the finest works in the Provoost group and is exemplary for the master's high level of craftsman- ship. Through the combination of its modest scale and highly detailed execu- tion, the painting entices the viewer to approach and thus become immersed in the imagery. Provoost must have 68</page><page sequence="4">consciously striven to achieve this effect, since the perspective scheme requires the viewer to look at it from a point close to the paint surface and from a relatively low position, approximately on the level of Saint Michael's head. Although from a distance the ridge of gray clouds can be observed to be painted higher at the panel's edges than in the center, when viewed from a vantage point near the surface, they appear to be on a similar level and to recede into the background, creating an illusion of depth. Seen from this position, the semicircular row of choir stalls around the throne is depicted in a rapidly accelerating but correct perspective. Moreover, the rather extreme foreshortening of Christ's lower body and of the central angel supporting the orb functions best visually when observed from up close.18 This perspective scheme also positions the viewer in the worldly zone. The iconography of the Last Judgment is complex, and an in-depth discussion of Provoost's different interpretations of the narrative will have to remain outside the scope of this article. Some iconographical issues need to be touched upon here, however, since they are important for the interpretation of the technical documents. In the Detroit panel, Christ makes a twofold gesture that symbolizes his judgment of humanity: while his right arm directs the blessed to the gate of heaven, his condemnation of the damned is asserted through the raising of the left arm. This gesture subtly connects the doctrine of the Last Judgment with that of the Passion, since it reveals the wounds of the Crucifixion in his hands. With one foot resting on the crystal orb and the sole of the other turned toward the viewer, Christ's power over the world and its inhabitants is manifested. The wound in the right foot is also displayed, further emphasizing Christ's dual role as almighty judge and redeemer. The findings from the technical examinations indicate that Provoost's emphasis on Christ's dual role was deliberate, since he significantly increased the prominence of the wounds of the Crucifixion during the production of the painting. IRR revealed that Christ's hands were in profile in the underdrawing, but in the final painting, the palms of both hands are turned toward the viewer, displaying the wounds more clearly (fig. 5). The position of the feet was also shifted. Christ's left foot was painted higher and more foreshortened than it was underdrawn. The position of the right foot was shifted rather dramatically: in the underdrawing, this foot rests on the orb, but it was painted in a raised Figure 4.

Spronk. position, showing the viewer the sole of the foot with the wound of the Crucifixion. Through the study of technical documents it is sometimes possible to determine the moment in the production process when a change may have taken place. For example, the shape of the proper right hand was altered after the robe was blocked in with red paint, since the area that was left in reserve for the hand is considerably narrower than the hand in the final paint surface.19 This feature was revealed with IRR: Christ's robe remained mostly opaque under infrared, appearing as a relatively dark field, especially in the shaded areas (fig. 5). 20 The position of his right foot also was changed after the background, the crystal orb, and the robe were completed. The X-radiograph showed that the robe was finished as it had been initially planned, as the foot was painted on top of some folds and the hem. In certain details Provoost's depiction is very close to the description of the Last Judgment in the Bible.21 Features such as the sinking boat depicted in the background directly below the central trumpet, the cometlike falling stars set against the dark clouds surrounding the mouth of hell, and a sea that is partly filled with blood follow the events described in Revelation 8:8-10. In other aspects, however, Provoost allowed himself a surprising degree of freedom from this literary source. According to Revelation 4:4, "around the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon these seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold." Although their total number roughly corresponds with the biblical text, Provoost painted young women as well as elderly men. In fact, there are four types of onlookers: crowned females and males, dressed in pinkish robes, are positioned around Christ's throne. Seated in choir stalls behind them are laureled females and bare- headed males, dressed in white garments. None exactly matches the description in Revelation, since the elders that are dressed in white are not crowned. Another feature that is depicted rather differently from the biblical description of the Last Judgment concerns the angels announcing the different stages of the Apocalypse (Revelation 8:2- 11:19). Instead of seven angels with one trumpet each, Provoost painted three angels, one of whom is blowing three trumpets. IRR revealed a rather surprising underdrawing in this area: only one angel was planned, blowing no less than ten trumpets. Here, digital layering allows an immediate comparison between the final painting (fig. 6a) and the initial composition (fig. 6b) in a combined image (fig. 6c). In the X- radiograph of this detail (fig. 6d), the central angel is relatively dark, indicating that its outline was left in reserve from the clouds and the sky, which were painted first. The lateral angels, however, were added after the sky was finished: they appear much lighter than the central angel because two layers of paint absorb X-rays to a greater extent than one. This is further supported in the X-radiograph as the diagonal brushstrokes of the sky continue within the contours of the left angel. Again, a layered image (fig. 6e) shows the correlation between the X- radiograph and the painting's surface. The following sequence of events thus may be proposed from the technical documents: after having painted the sky and the clouds, Provoost started to 70</page><page sequence="6">Figure 6.

When he was ready to paint the angel's hands, a problem that he apparently had faced during the planning of the composition became acute. He had omitted the hands in the underdrawing, probably because it was not possible to draw them convincingly holding ten trumpets at one time. The underdrawing of the mouthpieces of the ten trumpets in the angel's mouth was also impossible to complete in the paint 71</page><page sequence="7">Figure 7. Detail, digital infrared reflectogram assembly (fig. 1). IRR: R. Spronk. stage. Therefore, the plan outlined in the underdrawing had to be changed drastically . Provoost decided to paint three trumpets, which appears to be the maximum number that credibly fit the angel's hands and mouth. Three trumpets provide less opportunity than ten for the painter to suggest a three- dimensional space through perspectival depiction and foreshortening. To resolve this issue, Provoost decided to paint those trumpets longer and to add a smaller angel on either side, each with a single trumpet, thus improving upon the initial spatial concept. This change did cause some additional minor problems that needed to be resolved. The left trumpet of the central angel, for example, was painted where a ship with a billowing sail had been planned in the underdrawing. The ship was moved to the left in the final paint surface (figs. 6a-c). When the painting was first examined with IRR by Molly Faries of Indiana University and Barbara Heller, head conservator at the DIA, in 1984, an unexpected change between the under- drawing and the final execution in paint was observed in the lower left corner (fig. 7). Faries wrote, "The man in the foreground who walks towards St Peter was originally underdrawn as a woman, decorously covered by long locks of hair."22 The figures to the man's imme- diate left and right are female, and Provoost might have made the change in order to maintain a certain balance in the gender of the blessed figures. Another change in this area concerns the resurrected man in the foreground who is being helped out of his grave by an angel. In the underdrawing, the torso of this figure is covered by a large boulder that was taken up into a first paint stage. The paint contained some black, since this area was not fully penetrated with infrared and appears gray in the IRR assembly (fig. 7). The boulder was later partially painted over with flesh tones, as confirmed in the X-radiograph, where the shape of the boulder shows up as a slightly lighter area. As a result of this change, the man appears to be less tormented in the final paint surface than in the underdrawing. Although certain elements in the painting were not underdrawn, this does not mean that they were not part of the initial compositional plan. The ornate gate of heaven to the left and the group of figures being pushed by a wheel equipped with nails toward the mouth of hell (figs. 8a- c) might have been copied from prints or pattern drawings, making detailed underdrawing unnecessary. The small, armed demons emerging from the bloody sea and vanishing into a helmet (fig. 8c) bring to mind marginalia from manuscript illuminations and may have been copied from examples that were present in the workshop. The helmet and the nails of the wheel were painted in black and thus appear dark in the IRR. The small chariot in the background was not underdrawn in its present position, but it was part of the initial planning. Faries observed with IRR that originally the chariot was placed on the horizon 72</page><page sequence="8">Figure 8. Detail (fig. 1). IRR and digital imaging: R. Spronk. 8a. Digital infrared reflectogram. The gallows are indicated by the arrow. 8b. 30% opaque visible light image merged with the underlying digital infrared reflectogram assembly. 8c. Visible light image of the paint surface. directly to the right of the gate of heaven, facing in the opposite direction (% 7). Provoost left other underdrawn features of the composition unused. In the underdrawing, Saint Michael has a small cross on his forehead which was not taken into a paint stage (figs. 8a-c). Provoost might have decided to omit this tiny detail after having painted the helmet in the background, which leaves little space for any other details. Saint Michael in the Bruges Last Judgment is equipped with such a small cross (fig. 4). Two strips, which may have been part of a banner, initially were planned to swirl down from Michael's staff on the left, as they were underdrawn but never painted (fig. II).23 Other small but striking examples of discarded underdrawn details, which were earlier observed by Faries, are the little demon in the reddish water, the minute gallows with a hanged figure on the walls next to the gate (figs. 8a-c), and a similar larger figure at the edge of the clouds hovering over the mouth of hell (fig. 9). The omission of these rather horrific features could be explained in light of Provoost's general emphasis on redemption instead of judgment and could even be interpreted as a conscious decision by the painter to reduce some of the frightening imagery. Significant changes in the composition were also found in the lower right section of the painting. Although the dark clouds above the mouth of hell remained mostly opaque in IRR, the 73</page><page sequence="9">Figure 9. Detail, digital infrared reflectogram assembly (fig. 1). IRR: R. Spronk. faint contours of a bird-shaped form were revealed. The head of a creature with a large crest resembling that of a cockatoo was positioned to the right of the jug, close to the edge of the panel (fig. 9). Since the bird-shaped figure was taken to a paint stage before it was painted over, X-radiography proved to be more informative here than IRR. The X-radiograph shows that the contours of the creature were first left in reserve from the background (fig. 10). Then the figure was painted, the lower part in a pigment that is slightly more opaque to X-rays. The eye appears in the IRR as a circle with a center pupil. The lower lid shows as a light semicircle in the X- radiograph, indicating that this detail was painted in a pigment containing an element of high atomic weight, probably lead white or lead-tin yellow. The appearance of the egg-shaped demon in the foreground was also dramatically altered. The underdrawn head and the arms of the monster were closely followed in paint, but the eggshell is a later unplanned addition. The creature's bent blue-green legs were underdrawn straight in order to brace it in its struggle with Saint Michael over the soul of the resurrected man in the center. In the underdrawing, but not on the paint surface, the demon is equipped with insectlike wings at his back and a thick, curving tail (fig. 11). The interpretation of the IRR assembly of this area is hindered by the figure at the demon's feet. Although the monster's tail looks as if it is wrapped around the man's neck, this is not the case, because the reclining figure was not included in the underdrawing. The later inclusion of the figure probably forced Provoost to change the position of the demon's legs and to omit its tail. The resurrected figure in the center foreground, the insectlike monster crawling out of the mouth of hell, and the crocodilelike reptile biting the arm of the figure in the right foreground were not included in the underdrawing. X-radiography provides important additional information on the original insectlike appearance of the egg-shaped demon. The X-radiograph (fig. 12) shows a set of wings on its back and a smaller, more pointed torso. The initial contours of the outstretched legs revealed with IRR were originally left in reserve from the background (the lower legs appear slightly darker in the X-radiograph) but were altered in the paint stage. Some of 74</page><page sequence="10">Figure 10. Detail, X-radiograph (fig- !)â¢ these earlier painted shapes can actually be seen with the naked eye as the upper paint layers have become more transpar- ent over time (fig. 13). A rather enigmatic shape revealed with X-radiography (fig. 12) that is also still faintly visible on the paint surface (fig. 13) is the remnant of a face in profile. A large nose and part of a forehead, initially painted within the demon's opened beak, are discernible. This face is not an earlier version of the face of the demon, since the top part of the beak was left in reserve from the face. Although it appears that this second head was not underdrawn, there is no conclusive information from the IRR assembly here (fig. 11). A possible explanation for this puzzling feature is that the monster was underdrawn with one head but then painted with two, one human, one birdlike, and that Provoost later decided to paint out the anthropomorphic face. Some of the changes in the lower right area might well be related to the reduction of the more horrific details in the composition discussed above. It appears that these changes were programmatic in character and part of a deliberate campaign to limit the number of highly disturbing details. Provoost reworked the Detroit Last Judgment, and possibly also the Ham- burg panel,24 to a much greater extent than the significantly larger versions in Cambridge and Bruges.25 This difference in approach appears to be based on size and could be related to differences in function and patronage; it might also be linked to the organization of labor in his workshop. Paintings of the Last Judgment were produced for religious as well as secular settings. They functioned as altarpieces, and the eschatological imagery made the subject especially suitable for a hospital church or chapel. Last Judgments were also often placed in courtrooms, where the subject had a more admonitory function. The imagery urged the judges to be fair and reminded them that their own actions would be judgecf as well, a message that was sometimes reinforced with inscriptions on banderoles or on the frame. For example, the Bruges Last Judgment (fig. 4) was painted for the sheriff's room of the city hall and paid for by the Bruges magistrate. The lower tier of the partly original frame is inscribed in Latin with a section from Chronicles 19:6, which reads: "Take heed what you do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in the judgment."26 However, the modest size and close ideal viewing point makes such a public function for the Detroit panel unlikely. Medium-sized panels such as the Detroit painting might well have been produced for churches or for sepulchral settings in family chapels. These panels' frames were often in- scribed, although they could also have been accompanied with separate epitaphs. The original frame of the Detroit Last Judgment has been lost. A difference in function implies a difference in patronage. Larger panels were probably commissioned by reli- gious or secular institutions, but the smaller versions of the Last Judgment are more likely to have been painted for private patrons or for the open market. Institutions that commissioned a relatively large painting would usually have insisted on a high degree of control from an early stage over price, materials, composition, and the involvement of workshop assistants in the production. The master most probably would have had to submit a detailed study of the proposed composition for the patron's approval before the actual work on the panel started.27 For smaller panels this was probably not the procedure that was followed, and patrons might have opted for changes in the composition while the work was in progress or after it was completed. The greater number of compositional changes in the smaller panels might also be related to the organization of labor in Provoost 's workshop.28 Within the Provoost group, the quality of the Detroit panel is unsurpassed, and there is no reason to assume that anyone but the master was involved in its under- drawing or paint stages. In general, it is in the production of larger commissions that a higher degree of involvement by assistants may be expected; they usually would not have been in a position to significantly alter a composition independently of the master. IRR and X-radiography enabled the close study of the stages of the production of Provoost's Detroit Last Judgment . The application of digital image-processing techniques is important in technical examinations, as digitally assembled infrared reflectograms both facilitate the 75</page><page sequence="11">Figure 11.

The layering technique allows the correlation between the different technical docu- ments and the paint surface to be more easily read and with a much higher degree of precision than was hitherto possible. We thus are enabled to increase our general understanding of material aspects of paintings and to gather more information for art-historical research on patronage and workshop organiza- tion. We will, of course, never be able to bridge the historical distance between us and the painters whose works we study, but it is fascinating to be able to peek over their shoulders. 76</page><page sequence="12">Figure 12.

The Martyrdom of Saint Catherine of Alexandria in the Antwerp Museum (inv. no. 838; ibid., no. 135) was auctioned in 1904 in Paris as "German School." 12. The provenance of the Detroit Last Judgment goes back to the collection of King Louis-Philippe of France, who died in 1850. It was sold in 1883 at the Nieuwenhuys auction in Brussels (lot 1) as Jerome van Aeken, better known as Hieronymus Bosch. In 1887 the panel was acquired by James E. Scripps from the Paris art dealer Bourgeois Freres. Scripps presented it to the Detroit Museum of Art in 1888, and it was accessioned the next year. Abraham Bredius attributed the panel to Cornelis Engelbrechtsen in 1914. See "Expert Opinion on Our Old Masters," Bulletin of the Detroit Museum of Art 8, no. 4 (1914): 57-58. The attribution to Provoost was published first in Friedlander 1921 (note 8), 119. 13. The results of this study will be incorporated in the author's forthcoming dissertation on Jan Provoost. 14. The style of the underdrawing of the Fogg Art Museum's Last Judgment (Friedlander 1973 [note 7], no. 159) compares well with other underdrawings from the group and supports the attribution of this painting to Provoost. The oak panel was examined with dendrochrono- logy by Peter Klein, who suggested 1503+ as a statistically probable date for production. I am most grateful to Peter Klein for sharing the results of his analyses. Klein is preparing a publication of these findings for the forthcoming proceedings of the November 1996 symposium, "Recent Developments in the Technical Examination of Early Netherlandish Painting" (note 2).

Harbison, The Last Judgment in Sixteenth Century Northern Europe (New York and London, 1976), 8. 16. Ibid., 9. Following an earlier observation by Aquilin Janssens de Bisthoven, Harbison observed anticlerical and antipapal tendencies in Provoost's various versions of the Last Judgment. See A. Janssens de Bisthoven, "Jan Provost's 'Laatste Oordeel' Gerestaureerd," Handelingen van het Genootschap voor Geschiedenis 'Societe d' Emulation' 78</page><page sequence="14">te Brugge 94 (1957); idem, "De Herstelling van het Laatste Oordeel van Jan Provost," Gentsche bijdragen tot de kunstgeschiedenis 17 (1957); Harbison 1976 (note 15), 38-39. These interpre- tations are probably not accurate, however. See the author's entry on the Bruges Last Judgment in From Memling to Pourbus (Bruges: Memlingmuseum, exh. cat., 1998, in press). 17. Friedlander 1973 (note 7), nos. 159, 158, 157, and 156, respectively. The tree ring patterns of three of these panels were analyzed with dendrochronology by Klein, who suggested as plausible dates for execution 1503+ for the Cambridge panel, 1506+ for the Hamburg painting, and 1514+ for the Detroit version (see also note 14). The Bruges panel is dated 1525. A Last Judgment in Douai, sometimes attributed to Provoost, is not taken into consideration here. 18. This low viewpoint was not applied consistently. The crystal orb and Saint John's feet, for example, were painted as observed from above. It seems quite possible that Provoost combined a number of model drawings for the various details. 19. Early Netherlandish painters, like their contem- poraries, usually would paint the background first and the elements in the foreground last. In this example, the robe was left in reserve from the background and the hand was left in reserve from the robe. 20. It is not immediately obvious why this area is opaque under infrared. Red pigments in early Netherlandish paintings usually are penetrated quite well by IRR, unless they are mixed with black carbonaceous pigment. A preliminary examination of the painting was carried out using noninvasive X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy by Karen Trentelman of the DIA Conservation Services Laboratory on October 18, 1996, using a Kevex 0750 A XRF spectrometer. Mercury and lead were found throughout the robe, indicating that the pigment vermilion (mercuric sulfide [HgS]) was used, along with a lead- containing pigment, most likely lead white (2PbC03Pb(0H)2). The Kevex 0750A XRF cannot detect carbon, and thus the presence of a black carbonaceous pigment could not be determined. The lighter areas in the robe were found to contain lead and relatively large amounts of mercury, while the darker areas were found to contain roughly the same amount of lead as the lighter areas but significantly less mercury. Noticeably larger quantities of lead were detected in areas outside the robe. In the X-radiograph, the entire robe is relatively dark in comparison with the surrounding areas. Mercury and lead both strongly absorb X-rays, and areas painted with pigments containing these elements will appear light in aÂ£ X-radiograph in proportion to the amount of pigment present. Therefore, the robe appears dark in the X-radiograph because it contains significantly less lead than the surrounding areas. 21. In addition to several passages in Revelation, see Matthew 25:31-46 and possibly also Ezekiel 1:26-28 for descriptions of the Last Judgment. 22. M.

These strips might indicate the initial position of the banner of the Resurrection with the red cross on the white field to the right of the gate of heaven. 24. This observation is mainly based on the study of the paint surface. No X-radiograph is yet available for the Hamburg Last Judgment , and study of Faries's IRR assembly is hampered by interference of the heavy craquelure of the paint film. 25. Technical examinations have revealed many compositional alterations between the under- drawing and the paint surface in a large number of paintings in the group, allowing for the assumption that these changes were part of Provoost 's normal production routine. The amount of change in the subsequent paint layers in the Detroit Last Judgment is exceptional, however. See Faries 1989 (note 22); Spronk 1993 (note 8), 1996 (note 1), and 1997 (note 14). 26.

In contracts between painters and their patrons, it sometimes was stipulated that work on certain areas of the painting would be executed only by the master himself. See L. Campbell, "The Early Netherlandish Painters and Their Workshops," in Le dessin sous-jacent dans la peinture , Colloque 3 , Septembre 1979 , ed. D. Hollanders-Favart and R.

Van Schoute (Louvain-la-Neuve, 1994), 89-99. 28. Provoost is believed to have run two workshops, one in Antwerp and one in Bruges, which implies that he must have been a member of the painters' guild in both towns. Although this was against the guild's rules, exceptions were made, as Gerard David is believed to have done the same. See H. J. Van Miegroet, Gerard David (Antwerp, 1989), 27.
