<plain_text><page sequence="1">Milton as a translator of poetry John Κ. Hale ι Attitudes to translating Since Milton was serious about most things, we expect to find him serious about translating. The evidence lies open to view: the number and variety of his translations (though his translations of poetry alone are here considered); the care with which he preserved verse translations, some of them early or slight, to publish them with his other poems in 1645 and 1673; the signs in some of his renderings that he was following a particular mode or theory of translating. Yet it would be misleading to see him as simply earnest and doctrinaire about translating. At least four possible objections complicate the picture. First, he did not always relish translating. Secondly, his language competence has been challenged, at any rate for Greek and Hebrew. Thirdly, he could be thought dependent and derivative, owing much to previous translators. Fourthly, his practice as a translator varies so much that it makes little overall sense: not only has he no theory of translation, but he is a mere dabbler in it — or so it might be argued. I state these complicating factors strongly because when they are faced and interconnected they provide a picture of Milton as translator which is more interesting than our opening one, of the earnest purist. Regarding the first complication we have the fascinating protest at the close of his translation of Bucer on Divorce (1644): 'My mother bore me a speaker of what God made mine own, and not a translator.' Was translating, then, frustration? What about the number and variety of his translations of poetry? This paper assumes that the translating of good poets, into verse, lay nearer to Milton's heart than did the translating of prose, in bulk (though his renderings of prose can be used for purposes of comparison). It will be argued that the rendering of verse into verse, being done for the needs of various occasions, should be read as occasional verse - provided we recognize that some occasions aroused him more than others, and that not all can be known or reconstructed. An earlier version of this- paper was read to the conference of the Australian and New Zealand Association for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, held at the University of Western Australia in May 1985.

His Latin was excellent. So was his Italian. French, too, but he did not translate from its poetry, and similarly with other vernaculars which he had at command. Seventeenth century Greek studies lacked the intensity and continuity of Latin studies; yet even if Milton's Greek at first lagged behind his Latin, his love and knowledge of Greek were soon manifestly strong. All modern texts of Euripides accept an emendation which began as a note by Milton in his copy of the Bacchae.1 His enthusiasm for Greek writers was lifelong, passionate and thorough. And when he is reproved for malpractice with Greek accents, the fault may well have been his printers'.2 In fact, his linguistic scholarship is typical of him: although (or because) it is prima facie impressive, it provokes people —some people —into depreciating it. Thus Walter Savage Landor, who thought that Milton's Greek verses could be readily surpassed by those of senior pupils at an English public school, got his hatchet out again for Milton's Psalms done from the Hebrew: 'Milton was never half so wicked a regicide as when he lifted up his hand and smote King David.'3 The castigating of his dependence on earlier translators involves further distortion or misunderstanding. Certainly, he incorporates phrases from other versions, for instance English or Latin versions of the Psalms; and this magpie practice may not suit one's ideal image of the translator labouring alone with the ipsissima verba of the original text. Nevertheless, it accords with other seventeenth-century translations, whether of biblical or classical texts; for example, Dryden's Aeneid. Indeed, when a version was designed for liturgical use, as I shall argue Milton's Psalms were, such incorporating of predecessors might be expected, even welcomed.4 The resolving of that complication connects with the final one, the great variety within his translating practice. Once we recognize that his reliance on ι Bacchae, line 188. See Milton's own description of his education in languages, Ad Patrem, lines 78—85, also η. 11 below. 2 There are signs of printer's attempts to correct accentual mistakes of Poems 1645 in Poems 1673, although the results were worse still: see John Carey's summary in John Carey and Alastair Fowler (eds), The Poems of John Milton, Annotated English Poets (London, 1968), 229. (That it is exceedingly hard to get Greek accents and breathings printed correctly, whether in 1645 or 1968, is shown by the presence of errors in Carey's text!) 3 Landor's witticisms are to be found in the Imaginary Conversations, in (respectively) the conversation between Southey and Landor himself and that between Southey and Porson; the first is uttered by 'Landor', without demur by 'Southey', while the second is uttered by 'Porson' to cap 'Southey's' distaste. The untruth of the first remark has made me wonder about the second also. I have upheld Milton's Latin poetry in 'Sion's bacchanalia: an inquiry into Milton's Latin in the Epitaphium Damonis', in Milton Stud, 16 (1982), 115-30. His Hebrew is supported, and the literature on it assessed, by Leo Miller, 'Some inferences from Milton's Hebrew', in Milton Q, 18, no. 2 (1984), 414-16. 4 Carey summarizes the argument, pp. 306-7 of his edition. If further evidence of borrowing among seventeenth-century translations were needed, it could come from the fact that a psalm version after Milton's borrowed from him in turn. On the whole subject see William B. Hunter, Jr, 'Milton translates the Psalms', in Philol Q, 40 (1961), 485-94.</page><page sequence="3">240 John Κ. Hale predecessors does not betoken incompetence but rather the varying occasions and purposes of translation, his translating at once has greater interest. It brings us nearer to the man himself, to his intellectual and imaginative life, than if we adopt the single rigid canon of'fidelity'. It is plain how various is his practice when we recall the ideas of his younger contemporary, Dryden. Writing in 1680, Dryden distinguished three sorts of rendering into English: 'metaphrase', 'paraphrase' and 'imitation'.5 Metaphrase keeps close to the words, and word order, of the original. Paraphrase, to Dryden, means 'translation with latitude, where the author is kept in view by the translator, so as never to be lost, but his words are not followed so strictly as his sense'. Imitation, of course, is freer still: it verges on adaptation and recreating, as in Dryden's own 'opera' version of Paradise Lost, The State of Innocence and Fall of Man. Now some of Milton's versions can be placed along this scale of Dryden's. The ode of Horace proclaims itself metaphrase by being 'rendered almost word for word'. The early Psalm versions are imitations, for instance in expanding and embellishing their originals. And many of the excerpts translated in the course of being quoted for some work of prose controversy are, in Dryden's sense, paraphrases. On the other hand, not every example is easy to classify in Dryden's terms. Psalms 80—88 do not simply render 'the very words of the text' but add a good deal of other matter; which makes them an intriguing combination of metaphrase with imitation. The Horace ode more clearly shows that Milton's attitude towards translating may be an enquiring one: it is 'Rendered almost word for word without rhyme according to the Latin measure, as near as the language will permit' (italics mine). Is this not tantamount to asking what the language will, and will not, permit? Consequently, as we appraise each version, we must understand the purpose of each; and we must appreciate the range of Milton's attempts. Again, as translator he is partly carrying out experiments; but an experiment is successful when it finds something out, not necessarily because the result is beautiful. Finally, it is implicit in what has been said so far that he brings a good deal of himself to his rendering of other poets into English verse of his own. He is not self-effacing, not even as a translator. His performances are like his attitudes: changing, personal, experimental, and sometimes passionate. 2 Checklist of the verse translations There follows a summary of his translations of poetry, listing for each: (i) Title, and reference to its number and page in the Carey and Fowler edition; (ii) Verse-medium used; (iii) Date of composition and/or publication (where 5 In the preface to his translation of Ovid's Epistles (1680).</page><page sequence="4">Milton as a translator of poetry 241 known), with its context in Milton's life and work; (iv) Milton's own remarks about it.

Various metres and rhyme-schemes: each version is in a different medium. One (Psalm 2) is identified as in 'Terzetti' in its title. Dating is likewise rather precise. Psalm 1 is 'done into verse, 1653'; but for the other seven Milton tells us the exact date, for example 'Psalm iii / August 9, 1653 / When he fled from Absalom.' Probably all eight were done in that month. 3 Verse quotations More than half of this list consists of passages of poetry quoted during Milton's prose work, usually to support some argumentative or con troversial point. Accordingly, the main aim is to support that point clearly. Hence we find few airs and graces in the versions, most of which are short and in varying degrees truncated. They keep mainly to the word order of the originals, and so start off in metaphrase and drabness, in a way that is pedantic — or would be but for a marked counter-tendency to move towards what is native English, or personal to Milton himself. Τ wo examples from Horace make these tendencies plain. One (Satires 1.1.24—6) starts off on stilts, rendering very literally. Horace says, 'Quamquam ridentem dicere verum / Quid vetat?' and Milton gives the same words in the same order: 'Laughing to tell the truth / What hinders?' But to render the next point, 'Ut pueris olim dant crustula blandi / Doctores' (literally, 'As kindly teachers give pupils little cakes as rewards'), he turns these (possibly alien) cakes into 'Junkets and knacks' (sweets and knick-knacks) — a small change, but colloquializing and welcome. The tendency is stronger when he quotes Horace again (Epistles i.xvi.40—5) on the public man whose private life is squalid, his family and neighbours knowing what the admiring world does not: 'introrsum turpem, speciosum pelle decora'. This means 'disgraceful within, despite the fair-seeming skin', but Milton gives it as 'Sees his foul inside through his whited skin'. 'Whited', with its connotations of concealment and leprosy, is not in the Latin: Milton draws in gospel allusion to the Pharisees as 'whited sepulchres' (Matthew 23.27),6 and to hypocritical purity of surface. Thus he stays close to Horace until near the end of his 6 In the King James version, 'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.' See also n. n.</page><page sequence="6">Milton as a translator of poetry 243 excerpt, when he allows himself a more personal phrasing to gain a climax; appropriating and applying Horace's point, as he begins the re-entry from quotation into the present concern. That this is a general tendency receives support from the lines of Euripides, prominently placed on the title-page of Areopagitica\ for the words italicized are ones added to the Greek: This is true liberty when freeborn men Having to advise the public may speak free . . . His thoughts run on freedom even more than do those of Theseus in the original. It is interesting that he introduces a distinction between 'true' liberty and some other sort, because similar interpretative additions and changes occur throughout his Bucer translation.7 He seems to take his stand at first inside the boundaries of metaphrase, so as to move across them with sudden, personal force. Just as in all his occasional verse, something quiet and conventional all at once yields to the surging michelangelesque terribilità. 4 The fifth ode of Horace's first book But what is true of fragmentary quotations may not hold good for renderings of whole poems. The version of Horace's lovely ode 'Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa' is undated, and the question of dating bears on the present enquiry. Are we to date it early, with Carey and others, because its subject is relief at getting free from an unreliable woman? Milton could have felt thus at more than one period of his life, and could have chosen to translate the ode for quite other reasons. Again, are we to follow William Riley Parker in thinking the version early because we dislike it? Fortunately, there are considerations more solid than these conjectures. The version is printed in the 1673 Poems but not in the 1645, which (together with other arguments advanced by J. T. Shawcross) suggests a time after 1645; a time when, as we shall see, translation and experiment occupied Milton a good deal.8 7 See Arnold Williams, 'Milton as translator: notes on Milton's method of translation in The Judgement of Martin Bucer, Appendix D of the Yale edition of the Prose Works, π (1959), 808-18. Interpretative changes are found in his quotations from Italian poets, e.g. Ariosto, Orlando Furioso, 34.80: 'Questo era il dono (se pero dir lece) / Che Costantin al buon Silvestro fece', which becomes 'This was that gift (if you the truth will have) / That Constantine to good Sylvestro gave'. Did Milton misread pero ('however', 'on that account') as vero? Or did he alter Ariosto's ironic apology to straightforward protestant indignation? 8 Carey, The Poems of John Milton, 96; Parker, in Milton: A Biography, 2 vols (Oxford, 1968), 575-8 and 745-6 ( = n. 4); Shawcross, 'Of chronology and the dates of Milton's translation from Horace and the New Forcers of Conscience', in Studies in English Literature, 3 (1963), 77-84. The full text of the Horace ode is: Quis multa gracilis te puer in rosa Perfusus liquidis urget odoribus, Grato, Pyrrha, sub antro? Cui flavam religas comam,</page><page sequence="7">244 John Κ. Hale As already noticed, the title itself suggests experiment, a testing of what English can — and cannot — do: 'Rendered almost word for word ... as near as the language will permit.' For a start, English permits nothing like Horace's metre (the 'Fourth Asclepiad' stanza). Milton substitutes unrhymed iambics, in fives then threes. It seems that metrical inventivity is promoted by the practice of translation, if not required by its theory as well on this occasion. But how successful is the product, we should rather ask. The intention of literal fidelity does not prove constricting at first: What slender youth bedewed with liquid odours Courts thee on roses in some pleasant cave, Pyrrha for whom bind'st thou In wreaths thy golden hair, Plain in thy neatness; Ο how oft shall he On faith and changed gods complain: and seas Rough with black winds and storms Unwonted shall admire . . . But then comes trouble: Who now enjoys thee credulous, all gold, Who always vacant always amiable Hopes thee; of flattering gales Unmindful? The word order is tortured and obscure. Without the Latin alongside, would we know that 'vacant' goes with 'thee' not with 'who'? or what exactly 'vacant' means? or who, and in what sense, is 'all gold'? On the other hand the ending is excellent, and not despite the Latin word order but through it; most of all, however, through the late sudden surge of Milton's own voice: Simplex munditie? heu quotiens fidem Mutatosque deos flebit, &amp; aspera Nigris aequora ventis Emirabitur insolens, Qui nunc te fruitur credulus aurea; Qui semper vacuam, semper amabilem Sperat, nescius aurae Fallacis. miseri, quibus Intentata nites. me tabula sacer Votiva paries indicat uvida Suspendisse potenti Vestimenta maris deo. The text given is that which accompanied Milton's rendering in 1673. In some respects it differs from modern texts, most notably in line 5, where 'simplex munditiiV now prevails.</page><page sequence="8">Milton as a translator of poetry 245 Hapless they To whom thou untried seem'st fair. Me in my vowed Picture the sacred wall declares t'have hung My dank and dropping weeds To the stern god of the sea. For at the close he abandons Latin syntax, rejoining the adjectives with their nouns ('uvida' with 'vestimenta', 'potenti' with 'deo', in place of Horace's 'uvida I suspendisse potenti / vestimenta maris deo'). In the same stroke he improves on both adjectives: 'my dank and dropping weeds', dedicated to the 'stern' rather than 'powerful' god of the sea.9 He sets himself a 'stern' task, from out of the midst of which he seizes the thing he has to say for himself, in his own discovered voice.10 5 English psalm versions Since he translated more psalms than any other poetry, we should look hard at his ways of rendering them. His earliest psalm version is an expansion after the manner of Sylvester's Du Bartas: thus where the Anglican Psalter version11 of Psalm 114 has simply 'The sea saw that, and fled' the young Milton swells it into That saw the troubled sea, and shivering fled, And sought to hide his froth-becurled head . . . Definitely fancy rather than imagination. And yet the identical manner turns 'The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like young sheep' into 9 Edward Le Comte, 'Did Milton mistranslate Horace?', in Milton Q, 18, no. 4 (1984), 128-9, discusses whether Milton mistranslated the idiom 'potenti. . . maris deo', in which 'potenti' governs 'maris' (and 'deo' does not): 'the god who is lord over the sea', not the vaguer 'powerful god of the sea'. If Milton did miss this characteristic idiom of Horace's, he erred with many other translators, of his century and ours. But if, as I am arguing for other reasons, the translation at its close is moving out of the straitjacket of metaphrase into something freer, the question of mistranslation hardly arises. 10 Archie Burnett, 'The fifth ode of Horace, Lib. I, and Milton's style', in Milton Q, 16, no. 3 (1982), 68-72, surveys a long tradition of assessments of Milton's version. These vary from 'near perfection' (B. A. Wright) to 'as difficult to praise as to pronounce' (Ronald Storrs). Burnett goes on to analyse the technical reasons, the differences of word order and syntax and inflection between Latin and English, which defeat literal translation; but also to point out that Milton was aware of these. That is, as my own approach confirms, the version is neither a marvel nor a mess, but a conscious experiment. 11 The question of which version or versions of the Psalms Milton was working from (English, Latin, Greek, or Hebrew) is labyrinthine but mercifully unimportant here. He knew several versions, and would have worked over several at school in the course of the retranslation procedures described by Harris F. Fletcher in The Intellectual Development of John Milton, I (Urbana, 111., 1956), chs 13-16. Moreover, psalm versions in his day were often a mosaic of previous versions: see the article by Hunter cited in n. 4 above. The Anglican Psalter version cited in the text is that of the Great Bible of 1539, which Milton would have heard read in church.</page><page sequence="9">246 John Κ. Hale The high, huge-bellied mountains skip like rams Amongst their ewes, the little hills like lambs. That has some force. It flows from interpretation, from perceiving how mountains might look like rams, and move. But if so, already at the age of 15 translation is becoming imaginative discovery. His other early psalm is quite a little tour de force. Ό give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious: for his mercy endureth for ever' is neatly turned into Let us with a gladsome mind Praise the Lord, for he is kind For his mercies ay endure, Ever faithful, ever sure. Then, as is its wont, the Hebrew doubles the thought: Ό give thanks unto the God of all gods'; where the repetition has some force, but nothing startling. Milton, however, recharges the praise by adding an interpretative metaphor: Let us blaze his name abroad, For of gods he is the God . . . ('Blaze' meaning both to make a blazon of it, and to let it blaze out, 'like shining from shook foil'.) More striking still, out of the simple repetition that God is the 'Lord of lords' (verse 3) Milton forges a God 'who doth the wrathful tyrants quell'; so that the adult Milton's preoccupation with freedom shows already here as the young one infers it from the salvation history of Israel. True, the version does flag at times, or sink: And large-limbed Og he does subdue, With all his over-hardy crew . . . (strangely foreshadowing Dryden's satirizing of Shadwell as Og!). None the less, for most of its length the version stays fresh and dynamic. Both these early psalms, then, and especially Psalm 136, make good use of the freedom which imitation offers. If only the same could be said of his nine metrical psalms of 1648. They read only a little better than the Sternhold and Hopkins they emulate. They are as contorted in word order, as frigid in conceits, as the 'Psalms of David / In Metre / According to the Version Approved by / The Church of Scotland / And Appointed to Be Used in Worship' which perpetuate this travesty of psalmody. Which of the following stanzas would the reader suppose to be by Milton, and which by Sternhold and Hopkins?</page><page sequence="10">Milton as a translator of poetry 247 (ι) Her branches on the western side Down to the sea she sent, And upward to that river wide Her other branches went. (2) Thy land to favour graciously Thou hast not, Lord, been slack, Thou hast from hard captivity Returned Jacob back. Alas, both are Milton's: Psalm 80, verse 11 (lines 45—8) and Psalm 85, verse 1 (lines 1-4). Something at least can be said in behalf of Milton's efforts. Not along the lines of W. R. Parker's defence: 'His choices are an eloquent suggestion of a troubled and despairing soul. . . Psalm 86 is highly personal in feeling, and it may have brought Milton a special catharsis in translation . . . [These psalm] translations of his maturity must be regarded as exercises in morale as well as in linguistics.'12 But would Milton express personal sorrows, or indeed his personality, in so drab and contorted a style? In any case a different choice of psalms would have better suited his woes of this period. What can be said for Psalms 80—88 is this: they are an act of the civic minded Milton. Iri 1648 the Westminster Assembly wanted new psalm versions, for liturgical use and therefore in common measure so that they could go with existing tunes. Parliament assigned different groups of psalms to various pious bards; and one such group began near Psalm 80.13 So Milton, asked or unasked, made his contribution. Its interest for the present discussion is fivefold. (1) He annotates the psalms, citing the Hebrew where it is ambiguous or where he claims new accuracy ('the very words of the text, translated from the original'). So here, if not in other translations, Milton lays his Hebrew scholarship on the line.14 (2) These versions differ in purpose from all his other translations. Not only does the fact extend our sense of the variety within his translation practice. It also creates a sense of occasion, the occasion which he sought to 12 Milton: A Biography, 322-5. 13 See Hunter, in n. 4 above. Since the Assembly of the Kirk allocated psalms in groups of forty, Hunter is inexact in implying that Milton began where one of the groups began (p. 492): his first psalm is 80, which is last in the second group of forty. Perhaps this puts a question-mark over the idea that Milton was responding to Scottish events. Since 1648 was also the year of publication of Henry and William Lawes' Choice Psalmes Put into Musicke, and he had written a sonnet for its introductory matter, should we take his psalm translating as the outcome of a variety of events; a convergence of promptings? 14 There is not space to discuss it here. Carey, The Poems of John Milton, 306-8, summarizes study of Milton's Hebrew; and add Leo Miller, 4Some inferences from Milton's Hebrew', Milton Q, 18, no. 2 (1984), 41-6. I hope to write on this topic in due course separately.</page><page sequence="11">248 John Κ. Hale rise to: Milton manifests his wish to be of civic use, even to the racking of his muse. Perhaps he was overpersuaded by a sense of standing at a crisis of history, since in 1648 Milton would see at its completest something we may call 'the Hebraic equation'. If England = Israel = the pilgrim people of the Lord, then let the psalms of Israel be the liturgical utterance of this people, choosing this day (and every day) which god they would follow; and furthermore let Milton himself be the voice of the utterance! I am speculating; but the speculation suits his serious spirit, his hopes and that sense of occasion which informs all his verse translations. (3) Why, then, is the voice such a croak? Perhaps common measure, with the other constraints of liturgy, throttled his muse. Perhaps, too, the music was better than the words (let us hope so). But I prefer to speculate further: did he take a wrong turning at the outset with these psalms by underusing Hebrew's parallelism (parallelismus membrorum), its very distinctive way of making the same statement twice but with the second an incremental saying of the first thing: Ό Lord, who may lodge in thy tabernacle? / Who may dwell on thy holy mountain?' or 'Their sound is gone out / And their voice to the ends of the earth', and so on through literally hundreds of instances of this satisfying antiphony. It is surely a puzzle, for whether as poet or Hebraist Milton might have responded more audibly to this strong flavour of the psalmist's style. (4) On one matter, fortunately, we need not speculate: Milton was clearly excited by the opportunity offered him in this piece of translating work to interpret as he translated; to expand on the psalms' plainness of thought by adding what the context implied, or allowed, or what came to his mind from his other Old Testament reading. Though such interpretative expansion is found in his versions of classical authors, he evidently saw greater scope for it here. By the same token, he scrupulously declared (by putting it into different type) whatever was not in the Hebrew explicitly. As previously remarked, the combining of imitation with metaphrase is interesting, both in principle and as an example of his experimentation with modes of translating. (5) Yet the expansions themselves do not hold strong interest, at least not for me. They tend to expressive embellishment of the psalmist, as in 'They pass through Barca's thirsty vale, / That dry and barren ground' (Psalm 84, verse 6); or to a more deliberate moralizing, so as to separate the cruelty of the wicked from the devotion of the righteous, as in 'For they amidst their pride have said / By right now shall we seize / God's houses' (Psalm 83, verse 12). Only rarely do we note touches that are personal and vivid, as in the compassionate 'There even the sparrow freed from wrong / Hath found a house of rest' (Psalm 84, verse 3). Exactly how sparrows are 'wronged' may</page><page sequence="12">Milton as a translator of poetry 249 not be clear, but Milton's opposition to oppressors is as evident in this version as in his earlier psalms. The Psalms of 1653 are different again. By now wholly blind, he could hardly attend to niceties of Hebrew pointing. Instead, the evident new departure is stanza-form and rhyme-scheme. No two of the eight psalms are alike in these respects. Once, indeed, he seems to have common measure in his sights again: Jehovah to my words give ear My meditation weigh The voice of my complaining hear . . . all of which would fit the tune of 'Crimond' and the like; but then the dreaded moment passes, my complaining hear, My King and God, for unto thee I pray. (Psalm 5) The lengthening-out of the last line defeats the ear's expectation, and revives the stanza-form; into urgency, really, as if the stanza found itself needing longer to make its address to God. And all the new stanza forms work like this. They are novel, full of run-one lines which thus convey urgency. Each sounds like the voice of somebody searching for something. Only what? A better relationship with the Lord, or a more flexible verse medium? It could of course be both, but I am less sure of the first than of the second. We have seen several signs that the translating of poetry was for Milton an experimenting with poetic voices. The complex syntax and run on lines of Psalm 4 show him seeking for 'stretch' in his syntax: Psalm iv August 10, 1655 Answer me when I call God of my righteousness In straits and in distress Thou didst me disenthrall And set at large; now spare, Now pity me, and hear my earnest prayer. Great ones how long will ye My glory have in scorn How long be thus forborne Still to love vanity, To love, to seek, to prize Things false and vain and nothing else but lies?</page><page sequence="13">250 John Κ. Hale In each whole stanza the syntax has muscle and life. In the mid-line pause of line 5 syntax is miming the turn from past to present, and the turn to God in prayer. The second stanza, even better, has the true Miltonic surge of energy in the long closing line; with its cumulative contempt, it washes the filth away as a higher tide than usual cleanses a beach. One is tempted, therefore, with benefit of hindsight, to connect this syntactic and metrical searching with a gradual return to his plans for an epic: is there not here a girding of the bardic loins, for something bigger and better than translation?15 6 Milton's Greek psalm: his best translation? Psalm 114 is not like his other translations. For one thing, it is a second attempt at a version, the first being his earliest known translation. More significantly, it is his only translation into a language other than English. That fact must have detracted from its interest and reputation, yet in some ways it accounts for its merits too. One clue is given us in Milton's note concerning the writing itself. In a Latin letter to Alexander Gill (4 December 1634) he says he is sending what is not really mine, but belongs just as much to the truly divine poet. Last week 1 adapted this song of his to the rule of Greek heroic verse. I did so with no deliberate intention certainly, but acted upon some sudden impulse. I wrote it before daybreak, while I was still practically in bed.16 The 'clue' mentioned is that he wrote the version first thing in the morning, that is, at the time of day which was later to be the time of his dictating of Paradise Lost, and which we therefore may guess was the time in general of his best, least forced, composition. At this early period, though, his own processes may not have been recognized or understood by him ('on some sudden impulse'). Another clue may lie in the choice of medium, 'Greek heroic verse'. Here again, in the translating into the medium of hexameter, is the aspiration towards epic. We might even, from our own present perspective, risk a further speculation. Since not only did some psalms narrate the deliverance of the chosen people by God and the founding of the nation Israel by that saving act, but also Milton may have seen the life of his 15 As also in the sonnets of this period. 16 Carey, The Poems of John Milton, 229. The Latin text runs: 'Mitto itaque quod non plane meum est, sed et vatis etiam illius vere divini, cuius hanc Oden altera aetatis septimana, nullo certe animi proposito, sed subito nescio quo impetu ante lucis exortum, ad Graeci carminis heroici legem in lectulo fere concinnabam . . .' Milton goes on to explain that he has written no other Greek since leaving St Paul's (nine years before), the reason being that 'whoever spends study and pains in this age on Greek composition runs a risk of singing mostly to the deaf (The Works of John Milton, New York, xn, Familiar Letters, etc., 1936, p. 17). It is not absolutely certain that this letter refers to Psalm 114, but nothing else that we have fits so well.</page><page sequence="14">Milton as a translator of poetry 251 own England through the same set of spectacles, his translating of Psalm 114 — one of the greatest of these songs of the saving acts of God, and chosen for that reason by Dante17 for souls entering Purgatory to sing — becomes a vision of the life under God of the heroic community; a combination, though as yet only a minuscule one, of theodicy with soteriology which corresponds to the much vaster intention of Paradise Lost itself. Such enthusiasm is premature, however, for we face several barriers to the proposition that the Greek psalm is his best piece of translation, (i) It comes unacceptably early in his career, (ii) It is not done into English, the language which he chose from among several to be his vocal instrument, (iii) For those who do not read Greek, its qualities can make little impact, (iv) For those who do, its imitation of Homeric Greek can be faulted as incomplete, or else as servile. To answer these points, albeit briefly, because the principles behind the prejudices are important, (i) Since Milton's career moved away from translating, his best translation cannot in any case coincide with his poetic peak, (ii) Milton felt the- urge, even need, to be master in more languages than his first. Latin, Italian, and Greek allowed him to express things which English — at least in particular seasons and moods — did not. Though he chose to write his major poems in English, it was a conscious choice.18 What we must do for each poem is to look for the thing which the chosen language and medium held for him, hidden till that moment, (iii) For readers without Greek I can only suggest that (since transliterated Greek is rébarbative) they get someone who understands Greek verse to read the verses aloud to them, so that they can hear the sounds which Milton heard in his mind's ear that morning in 1634: to listen like this can be surprisingly communicative and efficacious, probably because Milton himself was always an aural poet, (iv) 17 Dante, Purgatorio, il, 43-8. Da poppa stava il celestial nocchiero, tal che faria beato pu descritto; e più di cento spiriti entro sedièro. In exitu Israel de Egitto, cantavan tutti insieme ad una voce, con quanto di quel salmo è poscia scritto. Milton was reading the Divina Commedia soon after translating the psalm, if not during or before it: see the early entries in his Commonplace Book (1635), and Parker, Milton: A Biography, 14$. My speaking of the psalm as cognate with epic may seem excessive. Yet works of introduction to the Old Testament often speak of the Pentateuch as the 'epic', or 'foundation-epic', of Israel. And the Psalms, though lyric not epic, repeatedly look back to the same saving acts, and in the same spirit, as the Mosaic books. Moreover, seventeenth-century scholars regularly aligned the books of the Old Testament with the classical genres. 18 No one would dispute his preference for English, evidenced strongly and early in his verse: see 'At a Vacation Exercise' (1628), 'Hail native language . . .'. But the fact remains that his linguistic abilities gave him a choice of languages; he wrote verse in four, and thought the choice itself worth discussing (see, e.g., Epitaphium Damonis 171-6).</page><page sequence="15">252 John Κ. Hale For those who do have Greek, any poem composed in Greek as a dead language may well be an object of suspicion: either a faulty imitating of a greater original, in this case Homer, or else an unfaulty but for that reason servile one. If this sounds like a Catch-22, that is because it is one. In what follows the text, now to be quoted and translated, I seek to bring out precisely those indubitable merits of the version which are simultaneously Greek in Homer's spirit, Hebrew in the psalmist's and authentically Miltonic.19 Psalm 114 'Ισραήλ ore παίδες, οτ' άγλαά φΰλ' 'Ιακώβου Αιγυπτίου λίπε δήμου, άπεχθέα, βαρβαρόφωυου, Δή τότε μούυου εην όσιου γέυος υιες 'Ιούδα.

She reads 'έκκτυπέοντα· in line 19, this being G. S. Gordon's emendation of the faulty 'ϊκτυττίοντα ; and I concur. An easy alternative might be to alter '/zeyaA' ϊκτυττέοντα to '/zcyaAa κτυττίοντα , but this seems weaker in meaning and a less likely error. I see no need for Carey's (rather complicated) hypothesis that Milton 'wrote έκτ- under the influence of the indicative form μ€γάλ etcrtme, [which occurs] three times in Homer'. The English version is Carey's, but modified in places to render Darbishire's different and better text, and to bring out the expressive force of Milton's Greek more fully. As one of a number of possible source-texts the Anglican Psalter version is given (as previously when discussing his rhymed English version). I wonder, though, whether Milton consulted any source-text that morning, for he would know the psalm by heart and (what with the likelihood of his reading and translating it in four languages) he would be working — in this imitation — from a polyglot Platonic Idea of Psalm 114: compare Dante's hybridized 'In exitu Israel de Egitto'.</page><page sequence="16">Milton as a translator of poetry 253 Literal English Version When the children of Israel, when the glorious tribes of Jacob left the land of Egypt, a people hateful and barbarous in speech, then indeed were the sons of Judah the only devout race; and God ruled in great might among the nations. The sea saw, and rushed in headlong flight, wrapped in surging waves; and holy Jordan was thrust back towards its silvery source. The topless mountains came forth and tumbled together leaping like lusty rams in a rich pasture. And all the smaller crags skipped with them, like lambs beneath their dear mother at the sound of the pipe. 12 Why, Ο huge sea, did you rush terribly in flight, wrapped in surging waves? And why, holy Jordan, were you thrust back towards your silvery source? Why, topless mountains, did you tumble together leaping like lusty rams in a rich pasture? And why, you smaller crags, did you skip like lambs beneath their dear mother at the sound of the pipe? 19 Shake, earth, in fear of God who thunders out greatness; shake, earth, in fear of the high majesty revered by the son of Isaac; God who pours forth sounding torrents from the crags, and an ever flowing spring from a weeping rock. In exitu Israel. Psalm 114 (Anglican Psalter version) ι When Israel cam out of Egypt: and the house of Jacob from among the strange people. 2 Juda was his Sanctuary: and Israel his dominion. 3 The Sea saw that and fled: Jordan was driuen backe. 4 The mountains skipped like Rams: and the little hils like yong sheepe. 5 What ayleth thee, Ο thou Sea, that thou fleddest: and thou Jordan, that thou wast driuen backe? 6 Ye mountains that ye skipped like Rammes: and ye little hils like yong sheepe? 7 Tremble thou earth at the presence of the Lord: at the presence of the God ofJacob. 8 Which turned the hard rocke into a standing water: and the flint stone into a springing well. Here Milton does pay his dues to the Hebrew parallelism, for instance in the last four lines of his Greek. In fact, each time the sense doubles back on itself he varies it, and sometimes he finds a more magniloquent phrasing for the reprise. It is not the greatest thing in his version, but at least he lets the Greek go with the grain of the original. In any event, he adds things which let Greek show its different, yet complementary eloquence. Adjectives which Milton adds to the spareness of the original make the version at once Homeric and forceful. Thus in line 1 'the house of Jacob' becomes 'the glorious tribes of Jacob'; not merely is the addition a typical Homeric epithet, it makes the second mention of Israel richer than the first — in fact achieves something of the incremental effect of the Hebrew</page><page sequence="17">254 John Κ. Hale parallelism by different, Greek, means. Still loading every rift with ore, he then enlarges 'the strange people' into the resounding demon apechthea barbarophonon (two syllables, then four, then five), 'a people hateful and barbarous in speech'. That very Greek disdain for other languages (which sound mere noise to Greek ears, hence the reduplicated nonsense-sound 'barbar') is here fathered on the children of Israel. Milton has noticed how the ancient Greeks, in their own manner, regarded themselves as a chosen people. He strengthens and adds verbs. The mountains, instead of skipping like rams, come forth and tumble together leaping like rams; and then not merely like lambs skipping, but ones which skip about beneath their mothers at the sound of the shepherd's pipe. The first addition depicts the mountains' movements in their imagined parts and sequence; though not necessarily better than the terseness of the Hebrew, it is at any rate a firm and clear visualization. The second addition is fanciful, certainly, but also charming in the exact vein of Homeric extended simile.20 The best of these verb additions, though, is the last: not simply the 'presence' of Yahweh, which even in English keeps some of the stunning definiteness of the Hebrew assertion, but 'God thundering out greatness', theon megaV ekktupeonta. The last word is the verb and its onomatopoeia can be felt on the mouth. Far from misforming ekiupeonta from ktupeo, for which Carey and others are still rebuking him, Milton has coined a new word for the great occasion — the compound ekktupeo, to thunder out. God speaks his presence in power; a bold neologism suits that; no wonder the earth shook, the shook out living waters, for that was the least it could do! Milton rearranges syntax, to make the communal voice of Israel escaping Egypt sound out with the force which Greek, and the Homeric hexameter, can give it. Thus line 4 ends resoundingly with the strengthened verb basileuen: God ruled as king. The line begins cunningly, reordering the constituent ideas; not 'Among the people God ruled' but 'Among God the people he ruled'. Greek can do this because its inflections save the interlaced figure from the ambiguity it has in English. Milton is placing the word 'God' literally amidst the phrase for 'Among the people'. Even if it sounds weird to English ears, it is very Homeric, this splitting of the prepositional phrase.21 20 A logical mind might object that in having the lambs skipping and suckling, skipping while they suckle, Milton's expansion topples over into the impossible and absurd. It may be so. One may rather envisage a field filled with lambs, some feeding while others frisk (since the two activities cause each other). 21 See W. W. Goodwin, A Greek Grammar (London, 1894), 263, §I2222: 'The preposition of a compound verb may also stand separately, in which case its adverbial force plainly appears; as &amp;τι κνίφας fjXOev (κνέφας irrrjXOev), darkness came on, Iliad 1.475; ήμίν απο Χοιήον αμύναι (άπαμύναή, to ward off destruction from us, Iliad 1.67. This is called tmesis, and is found chiefly in Homer and the early poets.' Thus Milton with ϊμβαόιΧζύω + the dative, to be king in or among, compare Odyssey 15.413.</page><page sequence="18">Milton as a translator of poetry 255 But in that case, Milton has wrought a brilliant paradox. The idea of a sole God, dwelling among his chosen people on earth, and rescuing them by visionary wonders on their long pilgrimage to the land he promises them, could scarcely be less like the limited anthropomorphic godlings of Homer (whom Fate, moira, governs, not they it). The strange and exciting feature of line 4 (and by extension, of the whole version) is this: the least Homeric of ideas rings out from the most Homeric expression. Milton yokes the sound of Homer with the vision of David. He has himself sung a new song to the Lord. Not that the version is without spot or blemish, however. If we judge it by its own standard of the 'rule of Greek heroic verse', and consider such features as prosody and dialect, diction and grammar, the following might occasion censure or misgiving, (i) As to prosody, Άίγύπτιον' in line 2 cannot scan — though the metre needs it to: the iota must be vocalic, so the scansion must be —υ-, 'ΐίλυμένη (6 and 13) is another false quantity, -uu- here but —u- in fact. For all that, there are only few such technical blemishes, and a countervailing panache about such prosodie climaxes as the ends of the lines (nicely varied clausulae, and a rousing finish in the last five of them considered together), (ii) Dialect is predominantly correct, that is, Aeolic Ionic in Homer's fashion. But 'ερρώησε' (5) 'ερρσώησα?' (l2) are peculiar: back-formations from Homer's 'ρώομat', 'move swiftly' which is not found in the active voice. Such misdeeds may send some classicists into a state of shock; yet there is another way of viewing this instance, in terms of (iii) diction. Post-Homeric writers of heroic, like Apollonius Rhodius (of whom Milton was fond), imitated Homer's diction, only not rigidly: they took some liberty to coin new words on Homeric principles as they understood them, with the result that similar peculiarities and back-formations appear in Apollonius. So Milton's dubious 'ερρώησε' may claim to be within the tradition, rather than a breach of it. Certainly his diction in the poem as a whole includes a number of post-Homeric words, especially ones found in Pindar, the Attic tragedians, or the Alexandrian epic poets. Yet the black sheep are only about one in twenty, so that the predominance of Homer's own diction is not assailed, only perhaps highlighted by contrast (as in the Alexandrians). None the less, there is no defending 'έντροπάδηιΛ The word is found only in the lexicographer Hesychius, and in a radically different sense: lucky that Milton had left St Paul's by this time, or he might have been thrashed for the enormity: he must have been stuck for a word of the right size meaning 'backwards' in line 5. Similar problems meet us in the case of (iv) grammar and syntax. 'φύλα , 'tribes', is followed by the plural in Greek. Yet Milton's singular genitive, 'Ιακώβου', could be regarded as a collective</page><page sequence="19">256 John Κ. Hale noun: Jacob, renamed 'Israel' by God, as the nation — with influence, or contamination, from the Hebrew.22 The point of these (doubtless tedious) technicalities is this: Milton's Greek polarizes its modern readers, to adulate or castigate. I have tried to give the errors their due, but to see the more debatable usages with goodwill; to read them with the grain in order to recapture some of Milton's own excited Greek reverie. For instance, in the poem's last word, 'δακρυοέσσης' might be thought a word of resounding therefore apt finality; but then disapproved, on the grounds that a 'weeping' rock is just the wrong sort of rock for the occasion: the Lord makes less impact on us by striking water out of a wet rock than out of a bone-dry one. My preference here would be, noticing that the water is 'àevaov', 'everlasting', to take the final adjective and its emphatic positioning as proleptic; the springs of living water went on coming out of the rock ('πέτρης', with a side-glance at Christ's pun on the name of St Peter); it was going to be a weeping, a wet and thirst-relieving, rock from that moment onwards. No doubt such choices are a matter, in the end, of taste and interpretative tendency. My own final impression, then, of Milton's Greek performance on this occasion is this: of an excited, impassioned trying-on of Greek singing-robes; of an inflamed apprehension of a fusion of Greek with ancient Israel; of brilliant resulting moments, not without lapses and wobbles too; of a highly charged experimenting, which — among our present array of verse translation experiments - is the liveliest and most permanently interesting. It is not perfect, but does an experiment need perfection? 7 Conclusion Milton as translator of poetry is experimental and strenuous all the time. He is personal, opinionated and fiery most of the time. And for at least some of the time the occasions of translation bring out in him the passion and vision of his English masterpieces; but do so in forms which, being unfamiliar, may have the interest to us of freshness. These translations have the further importance of revealing — when we take them seriously and with goodwill — his mental and imaginative life during the difficult years of his marriage troubles and early blindness. At the least, translation kept his mind on the business and possibilities of poetry. At the best, he translates in order to make the work of some great predecessor into his own possession; and even to bring into vigorous life something that is only his to say. University of Otago, New Zealand 22 This possibility is something which I cannot discuss here (see n. 14 above, and the article by Jack Goldman in Engl Lang Ν for 1983).</page></plain_text>
