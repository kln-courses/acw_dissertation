Coraghessan Boyle, juxtaposes the existence of southern California's affluent whites and non-white underclass by relating the stories of two couples whose lives become irrevocably entangled following a fateful automobile accident. The period flavour derives from racial tensions that culminated in the Los Angeles riots of 1992 and the passage, two years later, of Proposition 187, a package of prohibitive measures to curb the influx of "undocumented" immigrants from Mexico. Delaney Mossbacher, the book's main character, is a freelance nature writer with orthodox liberal views ? a caricatured Sierra Club member. He contributes a monthly, Annie Dillard-esque nature column ("Pilgrim at Topanga Creek") to an outdoor magazine. He lives in an upscale hilltop community designed in impeccable Spanish mission style ? the product of white flight ? apparently safe from the Mexican hordes that have broken through the border (the britde "tortilla curtain" of the novel's title) and are overrunning the flatlands. To keep this alien menace at bay, Arroyo Blanco's residents install a security gate manned around the clock. For further protection, they encircle themselves with a seven-foot wall. Mossbacher initially opposes both gate and wall (erected, of course, by "illegal aliens"), branding these structures as "intimidating and exclusionary, antidemocratic even." But he wrestles with, and eventually abandons, his liberal humanism for blatant racial hatred when he discovers, on one of his daily nature rambles in Topanga Canyon State Park, that a pair of illegal aliens are hiding out in ? and desecrating ? his beloved local retreat. (They turn out to be the man, with his pregnant wife, who blundered into Mossbacher's car on a winding canyon road in the book's opening scene.)

The wall is there to guarantee that "no terrestrial thing, whether it came on two legs or four, could get in without an invitation. " At a meeting of the local property owners' association, Mossbacher tries to alert fellow residents to the danger of leaving out food for the coyote, an opportunistic native predator, trying to get them to see the similarity between "illegals" and unruly local wildlife. Yet " they wouldn't even listen ... nature was the least of their problems. It was humans they were worried about. "x While eating his breakfast one morning ? still smarting from his neigh bours' indifference to the coyote menace ? Mossbacher observes two starlings pushing aside the wrens and finches at his backyard bird feeder. This act of aggression by a non-native bird against these smaller native species inspires him to write a series of articles on introduced (alien) species for his monthly column. From his research, he learns that the mangy starlings that infest the parking lot at his local McDonald's restaurant are descended from a flock released a century ago in his home town, New York City, by a " Shakespeare buff who felt that all the birds mentioned in the Bard's works should roost in North America."2 The starling's infiltration of Mossbacher's backyard mirrors the pollution of his own perfect life by a disease-like Mexican creature.3 Tortilla Curtain is a fictional anticipation of urban geographer Mike Davis's Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster (1998). Davis is equally intrigued by the humanization of natural threats and the naturalization of human threats. "Too often," he asserts, "wildness is equated with urban disorder, and wild animals end up as the symbolic equivalents of street 1 This is a reference to the New York City pharmaceuticals magnate Eugene Schieffelin, whose two greatest passions - Shakespeare and the acclimatisation of foreign species - apparently blended happily in this particular enterprise. Henry IV Part One includes the following line: "Nay, I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but 'Mortimer'. " Playing on the bird's reputation for mimickry, an indignant Hotspur says this to his uncle, King Henry, who has instructed him never to mention the name of his brother-in-law, Edmund Mortimer, an alleged traitor. The popular literature on non-native species is riddled with unsubstantiated references to SchiefFelin's impulse. But I have been unable to establish this charming anecdote's accuracy. George Laycock ? like many others ? suggests that if Shakespeare had not penned that line (and if Schieffelin had not been such a crackpot), then "we might not be plagued with huge flocks of starlings from Florida to Alaska"; Laycock, "Aliens," Wildlife Conservation, 95 (March/April 1992), 62. Yet there had been earlier attempts to introduce starlings that had nothing to do with Shakespeare and there would undoubtedly have been further efforts independent of SchiefFelin's whims had his releases in 1890 also failed. 2 T. Coraghessan Boyle, Tortilla Curtain (London: Penguin, 1995), 41, 242, 392. 3 Ibid., 108-10, 332.</page><page sequence="3">English Sparrows, Immigrants, and the Nature of Fear 433 criminals." Coyotes and cougars are "discoursively assimilated to 'serial killers' or 'gangbangers'," he explains, referring to the white suburbanite response to a rising number of unwelcome encounters with the animal denizens of Los Angeles's "wild edge." "Reciprocally," he continues, "the urban underclass is incessantly bestialized as 'predators,' 'wilding youth,' and 'wolf packs' in an urban 'wilderness'."4 Davis mentions starlings as an example of the cosmopolitan creatures that often thrive in built-up environments. He also refers to another highly adaptable bird, a habitat and dietary generalist that flourishes in human proximity : the (house, European, or English) sparrow.5 A century and a half ago there were no European starlings or sparrows in the United States. Today, some two hundred million starlings and a further one hundred and fifty million sparrows live there. These quantities pale alongside the former numbers of the passenger pigeon, which amounted to billions in its heyday. They do bring to mind, though, the once unrivalled hegemony of this native bird ? extinct by 1914 ? whose status was transformed within half a century from farmer's scourge to supreme national icon of tragic faunal loss. Jennifer Price, for example, chooses the familiar story of its fabled super abundance, startling decline and swift cultural resurrection as the entry point for her entertaining ruminations on the meaning of nature for contemporary Americans.6 By contrast, the starling and the sparrow have not received the attention from historians and other cultural commentators that their acquisition of a dominant position within the American bird population deserves.7 For Price, the pigeon's demise highlights the growing disconnection over the 4 Mike Davis, Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster (New York: Henry Holt, 1998), 267, 207-8, 238. 5 Ibid., 206. Davis seems unaware, though, that starlings were originally imported from Britain, specifying the east coast as their source. The sparrow to which he refers is the European (house) sparrow (Passer domesticus). But he errs in attributing its arrival to Spanish colonists. Like the starling, it spread across the continent from the east, having been transplanted - as we shall see - from northwest Europe. This sparrow is not related to the many varieties of American sparrow. Most ornithologists classify it as a finch and it is most closely related to Africa's weaver finch. The European sparrow is endemic to most of Eurasia. Though Britons call it the house sparrow, nineteenth-century Americans generally referred to it as the English sparrow ? not least because most of the first generation were English imports. In this essay, I defer to this contemporary (and continuing) practice. Unless otherwise specified, references simply to sparrows are to this imported variety. 6 Jennifer Price, Flight Maps: Adventures with Nature in Modern America (New York: Basic Books, 1999), 1?55. 7 See, however, Robin Doughty, The English Sparrow in the American Landscape: A Paradox in Nineteenth-Century Wildlife Conservation (Oxford: School of Geography, University of Oxford, 1978).</page><page sequence="4">434 Peter Coates course of the nineteenth century between nature and the urban Americans who failed to see the links between the living creatures whose massed ranks darkened the rural skies and the dish in front of them in fancy New York restaurants like Delmonico's. These well-heeled urbanit?s, she argues, increasingly defined Nature as a "Place Apart" and a "Place Out There. "8 Yet as the pigeon's numbers dwindled in the late nineteenth century, those of sparrow and starling burgeoned from the 1850s and 1890s respectively. Moreover, this demographic upsurge was most notable and noticeable precisely in those urban?industrial environments where Americans increasingly lived. Affluent New Yorkers might have had pigeon pie on their plates in the 1870s but they had live sparrows on their window ledges, under their eaves, in their backyards, in their streets and in their parks (where they were joined, increasingly, after 1890, by starlings). These avian imports bridged the widening gulf between the non-human world of nature and urban-dwellers and consumers that fascinates Price by providing an opportunity for Americans to establish fresh connections with the non human world of nature. Sparrow and starling also highlight a significant form of meaning beyond Price's imaginative journeys. The Nature that features in her adventures is simply American. There is no distinction between native and other birds.9 "Why save the birds?," she asks rhetorically, and answers, "for their beauty, economic value, potential as role models, and status as God's creatures ? but, mostly, for womanhood." Why save the birds? Another vital answer, I would wager, is "because they are American." The tender new sympathies towards (native) birds whose emergence she traces in the context of the women's crusade against the plumage trade was parallelled by growing hostility towards sparrow and starling. And those in the vanguard of (native) bird protection whom she cites - notably Frank Chapman, Olive Thorne Miller and Mabel Osgood Wright - also spearheaded the assault on the sparrow.10 Price's flight maps do not include the sparrow's and starling's transatlantic passages. Yet one of the most intriguing ways in which 8 Price, 35-41, xxi. 9 In her chapter on the meaningfulness of the plastic pink flamingo - the ultimate American lawn ornament - she explains that the real flamingo " no longer even inhabits the United States" and notes, elsewhere in the chapter, that it is non-native (Price, 113, 162). This information is rather confusing. Southern Florida's flamingos are visitors from other parts of the Caribbean who appear on occasion in search of food. Since they do not maintain a permanent presence, ornithologists do not classify them as native birds. 10 Ibid., 7-58, 61, 63, 66, 81, 82, 87, 90, 94, 98, 99, 101, 62, 67, 69, 85, 94, 95, 101.

"Without question the most deplorable event in the history of American ornithology," declared a bird-book author in 1903, "was the introduction of the English Sparrow." This will no doubt sound like an astonishing claim to those acquainted with the passenger pigeon's hapless history. Yet the pigeon's notorious fate (and the wild turkey's near-eradication), though undeniably tragic, were, in his view, mere "trifles" compared to the fright ful impact of the "invasion of that wretched foreigner" on a wide range of native birds.12 Introduced to the cities of the northeastern seaboard in the 1850s and 1860s, by 1870 sparrows had already spread as far south as Galveston, Texas and as far west as Davenport, Iowa.13 Ten years later, the bird had made itself at home in most places east of the Rockies. By 1898 the "conquest" of the continent by this "avian alien" was virtually complete.14 Biologists increasingly believe that non-native species are now second only to habitat loss as the main cause of the depletion and extinction of indigenous species in the United States (and worldwide). And there is a sense in the current literature on bio-invasion ? scientific and popular ? that today's level of concern over the impact of invasive non-native species is unprecedented. In the final third of the nineteenth century, however, few issues grabbed the attention of American ornithologists, naturalists and outdoor enthusiasts quite like the "sparrow question." In fact, most Americans with an interest in birds and the natural world felt aroused and this engendered a debate of such extraordinary acrimony that it was often referred to as the "sparrow war."15 The controversy was particularly 11 "Knowing nature through nationality" follows in the footsteps of the phrases "knowing nature through labor" and "knowing nature through leisure," chapter titles in, respectively, Richard White, The Organic Machine: The Remaking of the Columbia River (New York : Hill and Wang, 1995) and Paul Sutter, Driven Wild: How the Fight against Automobiles launched the Modern Wilderness Movement (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2002). I have chosen to write about the sparrow because its expansion and impact provoked substantially more discussion among contemporaries than the starling's exploits (perhaps because they occurred first). 12 William Leon Dawson, The Birds of Ohio (Columbus: Wheaton Publishing, 1903), 40. 13 Theodore S.

Through this little bird we can explore the late nineteenth-century connections between national identity, nativism and native nature and the intersections between a culture of fear and a nature of fear.18 The liberal (or pluralist) conception of nineteenth-century American nationhood urged the United States to enlarge its population and character by accepting diverse European contributions. The conservative form ? often dubbed "one hundred per cent" Americanism ? demanded the protection of the nation's existing British- and northwest European-derived complexion by barring alien, non-conforming elements. The liberal approach located strength and greatness in broadness of demographic composition and 16 See, for example, Editorial, "The Sparrows Again," Forest and Stream, 8 (12 July 1877), 379. 17 New York World, 48 (2 May 1883), clipping (no page number), Scrapbook 56, Charles Valentine Riley Papers, Record Unit 7076, Archives, Smithsonian Arts and Industry, Washington, DC (hereafter Riley Papers). 18 "Culture of fear" is a phrase popularized by the sociologist Barry Glassner in The Culture of Fear: Why Americans are Afraid of the Wrong Things (New York: Basic Books, 1999). Glassner's best-seller examines a range of media-stoked scaremongering "fear alerts." Richard Hofstadter anticipated this theme in 1963 in a lecture at the University of Oxford that identified a "paranoid style" of thought and expression among arch-conservatives that saw conspiratorial threats to nation, culture and way of life wherever it looked. He singled out "frustrated nationalisms" as the "common ingredient" linking all manifestations of the paranoid style. See Hofstadter, The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays (London: Jonathan Cape, 1966), 3, 7, 59.</page><page sequence="7">English Sparrows, Immigrants, and the Nature of Fear 437 respect for diversity. Conservatives found them in the cohesion and purity of homogeneity and separateness. The pluralist sense of nationhood, being fluid and open-ended, confidently anticipated future developments. Hundred-per-centers, though, harked back to the past perfection and security of a completed pattern and sealed identity, viewing the unfamiliar with suspicion. This conservative outlook fostered an extreme, defensive?aggressive form of nationalism known as nativism, a trait that John Higham characterized as an "ideological disease," an exclusionary "habit of mind [that] illuminates darkly some of the large contours of the American past; it has mirrored our national anxieties and marked the bounds of our tolerance."19 Since the 1840s anxious and frustrated Americans have identified various threats, internal and external, to the well-being of American values and the American nation, among them popery, atheism, Jews, the gold standard, alcohol, exposed female ankles, salacious movies, the Soviet Union's "evil empire," "environmental extremists" and, most recently, the "axis of evil" (Iraq, Iran, and North Korea). Discussing the American tradition of exaggerating the nation's vulnerability to foreign attack, John A. Thompson referred (well before "9/11") to an "exotic flowering of alarmism."20 Non-native (exotic) species such as sparrows and starlings (not to mention Japanese honeysuckle and kudzu) were far from Thompson's mind. But his image is highly appropriate for an essay that examines the role of fear in shaping American responses to an avian foreigner. Allusions to a "crisis of ecological identity" provoked by disruptive exotics echo the fears of those who fret over the dilution (or contamination) of the nation's European heritage by an endless succession of non absorbable peoples.21 At a 1988 international scientific conference about 19 John Higham, Preface to the second edition, Strangers in the Land: Patterns of Nativism in American History, iS6os to 1920s (195 5 ; rept. New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1963). The term nativism was coined around 1840 in the context of Protestant "Know-Nothing" opposition to Irish Catholic immigrants. Yet it is more commonly associated with the anti immigrant sentiments of Anglo-Saxon Protestant Americans between the 1880s and 1920s, when it had acquired connotations of Anglo-Saxon (or Nordic) racial superiority.

Yet their larger meaning and significance (and that of their counterparts, naturalizing images), is not at all clear. In the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century, however, the convergence between two varieties of nativism was much stronger and the case for the "greening of hate" is much more convincing.23 Michael Brodhead (writing over thirty years ago) noted the common ground, rhetorically speaking, between the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century expression of anti-foreigner feeling and hostility towards the English sparrow. Yet he discounted its importance: "The parallels be tween the movement to restrict foreign immigration and the 'sparrow war' are merely coincidental."24 To observe that reactions to human and other immigrants are frequently expressed in more or less identical language does not mean that they are more or less identical in nature. Similarly, to note that objections to a particular non-native species and a specific group of im migrants are registered essentially in the same breath is not to say that the response to the former explains hostility to the latter (or vice versa).

Nonetheless, Brodhead's focus on what he considers truly memorable about the sparrow war ?its status as "one of the first great scientific controversies among professional scientists " in the United States ? under estimates its socio-cultural significance.24 Advocates of immigration restriction often objected to the sparrow as well. Brodhead also slighted the importance of the rhetorical strategy that the sparrow's enemies adopted to inflame public opposition to the bird. In addition, he overlooked the extent to which supposedly dispassionate scientific arguments were them selves entangled with attitudes to humans. Most late nineteenth-century Americans (and Britons) firmly believed that animals and other creatures were part of a "book of nature" that offered instruction by demonstrating qualities of "good" and "bad" comprehensible in human terms.25 Though poor natural science, representing birds as miniature humans was an enormously popular device for natural history writers.26 Lining up behind the sparrow, Charles Hallock, editor of Field and Stream, pronounced it "in every way suitable to be an inhabitant of the New 25 Ralph Lutts, The Nature Fakers: Wildlife, Science and Sentiment (Golden, CO: Fulcrum, 1990), 147. 26 Robert Henry Welker, Birds and Men: American Birds in Science, Art, Eiterature, and Conservation, 1800-1900 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1955), 127-28. The job of the ana logy, the simile and the metaphor is to suggest parallels between otherwise unrelated things and to encourage comparison (Paul Ricoeur calls this a "picturing function"). The effec tiveness of metaphors both naturalizing and humanizing relies on the existence of com mon assumptions about the object of comparison. Citing the (naturalizing) example of "man is a wolf," Max Black points out that the "current platitudes" that are tied to particular animals highlight certain traits that can be readily evoked through the connection while de-emphasizing others. "The wolf-metaphor... organises our view of man" by transferring the received qualities of the "subsidiary" subject (the wolf) to the "principal" subject (man). In the same way, the (humanizing) immigrant metaphor organizes our view of the sparrow. The anthropomorphic metaphors that flew around during the sparrow war possessed the qualities that make what Wayne Booth calls a "good weapon metaphor" (his example, tellingly, compares a group of people to catfish). "You don't have to be an expert in semantics, " argues the immigration historian Roger Daniels (with specific reference to the hydraulic metaphors of floods, tides and waves), "to understand that one result of the habitual use of such language is to stigmatize immigrants as the ' other, ' rather than as the ancestors of us all." This "otherizing" process also worked to the sparrow's disadvantage. See Paul Ricoeur, "The Metaphorical Process as Cognition, Imagination, and Feeling," in On Metaphor, ed.

"27 But the bird's opponents, who clearly understood national nature to mean native nature, hotly disputed its eligibility as a member of American avian society.28 They hankered after something that Henry James referred to (in another context) as a "close and sweet and whole national con sciousness "?as distinct from the "hybrid farce" (to quote fellow novelist Owen Wister) into which American identity had degenerated with the mass immigration of the unsuitable.29 Like James and Wister, the Americans most concerned about the "little foreigner" were themselves of British descent.30 As such, they might have been expected to welcome a fellow creature at a time of dire warnings about the contraction of the nation's British-derived population. But these British Americans who had enshrined themselves as the nation's native stock were also the constituency most exercised by the fate of indigenous (i.e. pre-Columbian) species of fauna due to habitat loss, excessive hunting and the influx of non-native species. Sharing their status anxiety with other native creatures, they compared their own shrinking numbers with dwindling animal populations ? not least the native birds that the English sparrow allegedly displaced. In the book of nature's avian chapter they cast the English sparrow as a generic foreigner that em bodied the distasteful features of human immigrants from non-British sources. The bird was a flexible symbol, however, also serving "old-stock" Americans as a vehicle for the expression of anti-English feelings related to other issues. How, though, did English sparrows come to be in the United States? In the 18 5 os canker worms plagued urban trees from Boston to Washington.31 Branches teemed with fat, leaf-bloated caterpillars, many of which dangled at the ends of long threads, brushing against the faces of hapless pedestrians, dangling over hat brims, falling down their necks and crawling up their backs and sleeves.

"32 By full summer barely any leaves remained. With public squares, parks and avenues effec tively surrendered to the worm, summer in the city became unbearable. With harassed citizens crying out for "a Moses" (to quote the Times), municipal authorities, civic bodies and public-spirited individuals recruited English sparrows.33 More like contract labourers than Moses, they were expected to perform their assignment at no cost save for assistance with food and shelter during winter. The first batch that survived (from Liverpool) was released in Brooklyn's Greenwood Cemetery in 18 5 3,34 From his country estate near New York City in 1859 tne renowned nature poet, William Cullen Bryant, celebrated the sparrow's arrival: We hear the note of a stranger bird That ne'er till now in our land was heard ; A winged settler has taken his place With Teutons and men of the Celtic race ; He has followed their path to our hemisphere ? The Old-World Sparrow at last is here He welcomed the "bane" of noxious insects from whose "busy beak" there would be no escape.35 Illustrating that humanizing analogies and metaphors are not inherently derogatory, a Times correspondent also thought in terms of an ennobling re-enactment of the nation's foundational experience. He described a Manhattan release site, Union Park (1866), as "the Jamestown, so to speak, of these little colonists."36 An immediate record of achievement won over many neutrals and doubters. After a few summers hardly any caterpillars were left. The Times published glowing tributes to a model "public servant" that brought deliv erance from evil. The refreshing industry and virtue that these "energetic workmen" displayed in cleansing the city's parks underscored the sloth, inefficiency and graft of their human counterparts in boss-ridden municipal ?17 government.

Here, some commented, was the immigrant success story incarnate.40 But the bird did not become a firm favourite. A close relationship with the city counted heavily against it at a time when many old-stock Americans viewed swelling cities with distaste and fear. Frank Bolles 's invective typified this anti-urban bias : City-bred man without knowledge of lake and forest, mountain and ocean, is an inferior product of the race; but disagreeable as he is, the city-bred bird is worse. The English sparrow ... is a bird of the city, rich in city vices, expedients, and miseries. The farmer's son who takes to drink and the East End makes a hard character. The sparrow who has taken to a similar form of existence is equally despicable.41 In the early 1900s Henry James recorded the "sense of dispossession" that haunted him on the streets of New York City, surrounded by the "incon ceivable," "immeasurably alien" immigrant.42 Wister, one of Theodore Roosevelt's Harvard chums and a fellow big-game hunter and wildlife conservationist, also lamented urban deterioration. Sections of Manhattan's Lower East Side were the world's most densely populated urban areas and the author of the prototypical western novel The Virginian (1902) contrasted these fallen places with the "clean cattle country" of Texas, where the untamed Anglo-Saxon superman could breathe free and stretch his powerful limbs astride a horse on hallowed ground uncontaminated by Poles, Italians and Jews. The American city had become "debased and mongrel with its hordes of encroaching alien vermin. "43 Distaste for sparrows and other foreigners was intensified by the associ ation of America with purity ? a place of new beginnings uncontaminated by the past. A central theme in a recent history of arch-conservative fears and fantasies in the United States is the concept of " threatened paradise, " with "new aliens ... seen as vermin in the garden.

Pure American. No Rats. No Greeks."45 Dismissing it as a sooty "bird of the street and gutter," critics complained that its droppings fouled ledges, window casings, porches and awnings, besmirched statues and headstones in cemeteries, and defiled park benches. The uncouth and unsanitary sparrow lived in any available cavity, furnishing its filthy and unsightly "lodgings" and "tenements" with "any rubbish."46 In its squalid nest, the sparrow outstripped the reproductive rate of native birds by typically raising three to four broods during a breeding season that often stretched from late January to early November. According to a widely quoted statistic from a landmark government report of 1889 (Barrows report), one pair in New York City could well produce, over ten years, no less than 275,716,983,698 offspring.47 "The English sparrow stands to me," reckoned Bolles, "as the feathered embodiment of those instincts and passions which belong to the lowest class of foreign immigrants. The Chicago anarchist, the New York rough, the Boston pugilist, can all be identified in his turbulent and dirty society."48 To bolster his case for stanching the flow of non-Nordics, Prescott F. Hall, chairman of the Committee on Immigration of the American Genetic Association, was also drawn to this familiar avian example. As the First World War ended and the US faced the resumption of immigration at pre-war levels, the unsavoury nature of the "new" im migrants was compounded in Hall's eyes by their lower-class complexion. In his view, population pressure in Europe that propelled emigration largely reflected this social stratum's high birth rate. He claimed that the English working class's reproductive levels had been boosted by the "vacuum" resulting from an earlier epoch of mass emigration. In a strained analogy, which implied that quantities of sparrows comparable to their human counterparts had quit England ? and under their own steam ? Hall argued that "there are just as many sparrows in England today in spite of the unfortunate spread of these birds in the United States. "49 45 Leonard Dinnerstein, Roger L. Nichols and David M.

Goethe was a founding board member of the Sierra Club, a pioneer member of the California Audubon Society, a leading player in the Save-the-Redwoods League and an active supporter of the national parks. He was also president of the Immigration Study Commission and the moving force behind California's Sterilization Law of 1913 (the conservation of natural resources and human assets going hand in hand, in his view). To illuminate the under-appreciated threat to California from growing Mexican immigration in the late 1920s, Goethe compared the "peon problem" to the "English sparrow problem." Whereas most native birds were valuable members of American society ("songsters, insect destroyers, weed-seed eaters"), the "songless immigrant" descended on grain and "in a new favorable environment ... multiplied, like the peon." By 1919 the sparrow was pushing aside native birds in southern California towns, just as the "old Type American" was being "displaced with Mexican slum inhabitants" in border cities.50 Critics like Bolles, Hall and Goethe failed to appreciate that explosive urban growth was creating hospitable conditions for the bird. Instead, those who claimed to represent the reasoning voice of scientific ornithology turned the bird's success into a character issue. Sparrows were "lazy little louts" and "vagrants" who preferred pan-handling to an honest day's work.51 When not begging on fashionable uptown streets, sparrows were scavenging. Though canker worms were easy pickings, sparrows quickly located a far more reliable food supply: the wholly or partially undigested grains ? ideal for fledglings ? that studded the horse manure which liberally littered city streets.52 50 C.

The combined horse population of New York City and Brooklyn in 1880 was per haps as high as 175,000 (one for every ten humans). Each horse produced between fifteen and thirty pounds of daily droppings.

Among the common names that Coues listed in his widely consulted guide to North American birds were "Tramp. Hoodlum. Gamin"** "Gamin" is an obsolete word for a street urchin (or "street arab") who engaged in petty thievery (such as pilfering fruit trees) and cruelty and spent the rest of his time dodging the police. "These rowdy little gamins" Coues complained, "squeak and fight all through the city. "55 Another popular American term ?"little cockney"-was an English import. "The London sparrow," remarked Lord Lilford, "has frequently, and with some justice, been compared to the street arab. " If anything, the feathered version was more incorrigible. Other genteel Victorian Britons alluded to fast-talking, chirpy and quick-witted people, especially Londoners, as "cockney sparrows." In one of her popular country house novels, Charlotte M. Yonge described one character, a governess from the capital, as "a cock-sparrow for her London manners" and a "London-bred sparrow; a pert forward chit." This urban essentialism was encapsulated in the pen and ink engraving from William Yarrell's authoritative History of British Birds (1871-85) - reproduced in the Barrows report - that depicted the bird perched on a ledge against a city skyline.56 The "immigrant finch," Fletcher Osgood protested, congregated in "great hoodlum gangs" in New England's cities.57 Another critic cited a British source to support his view that the sparrow was an insubordinate 53 "Q" "Nuisance in Feathers."

"59 Sparrows fell foul of notions of decorum and morality in other ways too. Their "disagreeable chatter" irritated middle-class urbanit?s increasingly sensitive to rising levels of noise as well as olfactory assault. In Washington, DC (where he resided for much of his adult life), Coues reckoned that the bird's interminable prattle nearly drowned "the Comanche yell of the milkman and the fierce notes of the fishhorn," not to mention the "black newspaper imps who screech every one deaf on Sunday morning. "60 These complaints were supplemented by fears that its constant fighting, its bullying of native birds and, not least, its prodigious sexual appetite, set a perilous example to the working class ? especially adolescent boys ? whose animal instincts needed curbing at the best of times. The bird's lack of "domestic ethics," reflected Osgood, "surely does not tend, upon the whole, to [the young person's] social or moral elevation, but quite the other way. "61 Thomas Gentry once witnessed twelve bouts of copulation between the same pair in under five minutes; a friend claimed to have watched fifteen within the same spell.62 But these figures were trivial compared to the calculations of Claude T. Barnes. Stopwatch in hand, he clocked fourteen successive bouts of intercourse at a rate of ?ve seconds per act, with mere five-second intervals between acts. American students of the sparrow's "abnormal" sexuality were particularly shocked and excited to learn that nymphomania complemented "satyriasis." If anything, Barnes considered the female even more lascivious.63 Gentry regrettably concluded that these "saucy knaves" often copulated for "mere sensual gratification.

Consumed with outrage, Coues dashed off a short poem about sex and the city: Sparrows to right of them ? Sparrows to left of them - Sparrows in front of them ? Copulate freely.65 Nonetheless, the most effective way to exacerbate hostility was to publicize the bird's origins. As F. C. Browne explained, the English sparrow was a "filthy, noisy, quarrelsome, and bloodthirsty foreigner" ? with the accent on the final attribute.66 Often simply identified as "this foreigner," sometimes employed were the more pointed designations of "little Britisher," "little Saxon," "English stranger," "the Englishman," "English interlopers" and "little John Bull."67 A degree of antagonism frequently informed these terms. Northerners did not quickly forgive or forget the partiality of the British ruling class and certain segments of the British public for the Confederate cause. In his correspondence with Charles Darwin, Asa Gray, the Harvard botanist, remarked on Britain's desire to see the United States "fall to pieces" and the British belief that the Yankees were itching to swallow up Canada.68 Though the threat of war passed, Northerners were livid about the construction of Confederate blockade runners and armoured rammers in Merseyside shipyards. The persistence of powerful anti-British feeling was patent during protracted efforts to secure an appropriate settle ment (1872) of compensation claims relating to the exploits of the most notorious British-built raider, Alabaman The strength of the British fleet and of British influence in Central America chafed increasingly as the United States exerted its own economic authority in the region.

Bold, active, and vivacious, its distribution is as wide as that of the Englishman."71 Americans imbued with what Thompson calls "Anglophobic paranoia"72 were thus predisposed to see the English sparrow's colonization of their nation as another example of Britain's "hogging" of the world. In his seminal study of nativism, Higham argued that, despite these international conflicts, a feeling of cultural and racial kinship "exempted" English or British immigrants from anti-English or British feeling. This widespread assumption that Anglophilia was a basic ingredient of the American upper-class outlook at the time of the great sparrow debate is supported by the reverence of patrician sport hunters for the aristocratic English creed of the fair chase. John Reiger sees Forest and Stream as a "vehicle for importing the British concept of sportsmanship" which rou tinely carried news of the American progress of eminently English sports like polo and cricket. Meanwhile, New York City businessmen of the 1870s flocked to clubs that specialized in fox-hunting.73 Yet many sparrow defenders suspected that the bird's detractors were motivated by naked anglophobia. "I cannot account for the bitterness of some writers against this plucky little bird, " declared a Chicagoan ("Norman ") in a letter to Forest and Stream, "unless it is that he is a Britisher. " "Norman" identified the sparrow's enemies as those who "invariably decry everything coming from England: dogs, guns, gentleman sportsmen, even breeders who visit our dog shows." Disclosing that he was born in Britain, "Norman" contrasted American intolerance with easy-going British tolerance. Over there, he insisted, the denizens of wretched city streets and sumptuous country seats were united in gratitude for the worms, slugs and grubs the bird consumed.74 70 David Dimbleby and David Reynolds, An Ocean Apart: The Relationship between Britain and America in the Twentieth Century (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1988), 27. 71 John Watson, "The English Sparrow: 1.

Robson of Abilene spoke to the Kansas Horticultural Society about a bird that he had spent twenty years observing in its native haunts. He explained that, on reflection, he was unhappy with his talk's title ? "The English Sparrow." For Illinois issued naturalization papers to a "larger British biped" after five years' residence, while Kansas granted citizenship after just nine months. Yet "Jack Sparrow," despite residing in the United States for a quarter century and having produced many generations of "native born" sparrows, was still lumbered with the pejorat ive designation "English Sparrow." Robson saw no grounds for continuing to withhold "all the rights and privileges of free American citizenship and also ... the use of his proper name ? the House Sparrow. " He reminded his audience ? among whom, no doubt, were hostile farmers ? that the press and many leading citizens had hailed the bird's introduction (to save shade trees from ruin) as a glorious act of patriotism. In his effort to create an Anglo-American fraternity of sparrows he rode roughshod over the niceties of ornithological taxonomy, presenting them as "English cousins" to native sparrows.76 Objections based on the bird's allegedly bad character and alien origins, which Robson associated especially with Coues, told him more about Coues's nativism ? the "extreme hatred in your heart against all bipeds of foreign birth " ? than about the bird's true nature. He interpreted Coues's antipathy as an expression of the flag-waving Americanism of the second generation immigrant eager to obliterate all foreign traces, a bombastic effort to establish his credentials as a "Native American" that was necessary because you "just barely escaped being the subject of Queen Victoria because your parents emigrated to this country, and to cover this fact you became a bitter 'Know Nothing'."77 Coues was too young to have joined the Know-No things, an anti immigrant movement of the 1840s and early 1850s principally opposed to 75 "N.D.," letter to the editor, NYT, 8 September 1878, 9. 76 Speech reprinted in full in Prairie Farmer, 13 September 1884, n.p., Scrapbook 59, Riley Papers.

Though this term is now reserved for the indigenous inhabitants of those parts of North America that became the United States, in the nineteenth century a Native American was effectively an Anglo-Saxon Protestant of British origin; Native American was the title of the newspaper of the Philadelphia branch of the American Republican Party, a nativist organization that clashed with Irish Catholics in the 1840s.79 Yet Americans of British descent who bestowed native status on them selves did not automatically extend this status to floral and faunal immigrants from Britain. Domesticated species of non-native provenance such as cows, horses, wheat, and apples had been effortlessly naturalized, biotic citizenship having been granted unconsciously centuries earlier. In the latter part of the nineteenth century, however, many Americans of British stock consciously identified with truly indigenous species whose plight they attributed directly to the depredations of those more recently arrived feathered immigrants from England, the sparrow and starling. Notwithstanding their appropriation of native identity, sparrow critics like Coues retained an awareness of the continent's original human inhabitants. Anticipating Alfred Crosby's notion of ecological imperialism, Coues saw the sparrow's impact as part of a larger European biotic takeover, the ultimate manifestation of which was the elimination of native peoples (though he did not call them native). The aboriginal survivor, he noted, "sadly likened" floral and faunal usurpation "to the invasion of his country by the pale faces. "80 The Indian's recession did not bode well for native avifauna in the face of the sparrow's rapid advance, which, Coues warned, was just as likely to encompass the entire continent. By the late 1870s, as the last flickers of Indian resistance were extinguished and the buffalo was disappearing from the Great Plains, growing numbers of British Americans reflected on ? and 78 Coues was born in New Hampshire in 1842.

The English sparrow made a very late cameo appearance in Ecological Imperialism as a leitmotif of North America's "Europeanized" natural world (292?93), also in his earlier book, The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492 (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1972), 210?11.</page><page sequence="21">English Sparrows, Immigrants, and the Nature of Fear 4 51 sometimes bemoaned ? the impact of energetic Europeans on aboriginal species, especially non-human. The hardening of opinion against the sparrow following the Barrows Report (1889), which officially sanctioned popular hostility, prompted the British Consul at Baltimore to report home to the Foreign Secretary a month after its publication.81 The consul referred to the " universal "- but, in his opinion, largely unfounded ? "ill-will" towards what he also preferred to call the house sparrow, which Americans vilified, not least for "refusing to eat American insects" and hounding insectivorous native birds.82 British visitors agreed that the bird was a bad ambassador for Britain. Reflecting on his first trip to North America in 1881, the Duke of Argyll, a keen ornithologist, described the pleasure of a new floral and faunal experi ence ? a reaction evidently shaped by the hegemony of "Sparrowdom" back home. "With very few exceptions," he explained, "every bird one sees is a bird one has never seen alive before." He soon realized, though, that he had not shaken off the old country entirely because misguided Americans had transplanted "our old and forward little friend ... the London ,,QQ sparrow. The sparrow also attracted the attention of Ernest Thompson Seton, a prominent Canadian-American nature writer who had been born and raised in South Shields in northeastern England. Among his many highly romanticized animal stories was "A Street Troubador: Being the Adventures of a Cock Sparrow" (1901). This was a yarn about two English sparrows, Randy and Biddy, who were thoroughly at home exploring Manhattan's "brick wilderness." Seton recounted their rough courtship in Fifth Avenue's gutters, their constant brawling (even on Sundays), and their efforts at setting up home. The pair abandon a bird house for an unlikely nest site on top of an electric lamp in Madison Square Park, before finally settling on a notch in one of the park's elms. A drawing that depicted the bird box that Randy and Biddy had quit was topped by a sign that read "To Let: No English Need Apply. "84 81 W. F.

And British immigrants had not clustered in major cities, tending towards invisibility if not always effortlessly assimilated.85 During the sparrow war the most visible immigrant groups east of the Mississippi were southern and eastern Europeans and their West Coast counterparts were Japanese and Chinese. Before restrictive quotas were imposed on European immigrants from outside the continent's northwestern regions in the early 1920s, various measures to exclude Japanese and Chinese were already in place. In her popular beginner's guide to bird study (1902), Neltje Blanchan stressed the difference in attitude towards feathered undesirables and their human counterparts from Asia during the heyday of sparrow "mania." To highlight the sparrow's mis deeds, she drew on the imagery of the "yellow peril," beginning to catch on as shorthand for American fears of invasion ? demographic and/or military ? from China and Japan. "As the 'yellow peril' is to human immi gration," she warned, "so is this sparrow to other birds." Yet so strong was indiscriminate enthusiasm for the bird during the 1870s and 1880s, in her view, that had a "sparrow exclusion act" been suggested, "it is doubtful if a single senator who lent his voice to secure the Chinese exclusion act would have given it his support. "86 A "sparrow exclusion act" of sorts had in fact recently been enacted. Imperial acquisitions in the Caribbean and Pacific in 1898 heightened federal scientific awareness of the threat that casually or deliberately introduced organisms posed to the biotic security of the contiguous United States and of the challenge that mainland species and the "ill-advised acclimatiz ation " of species from other countries presented to new island dependencies such as Puerto Rico and Hawaii. For Theodore Palmer, assistant chief of the Department of Agriculture's Division of Biological Survey, existing regulations (1898) to keep human and livestock diseases at bay and to restrict entry of certain immigrants provided ample precedent for exclusion of potentially noxious animals.87 By empowering the Secretary of Agriculture to bar foreign species "injurious" to agriculture and horticulture, the Lacey Act of 1901 challenged the "open-door" policy that had held sway since Columbus appeared in the western hemisphere. And no species had been 85 Charlotte Erickson, Invisible Immigrants: The Adaptation of English and Scottish Immigrants in Nineteenth-Century America (London: Weidenfeld and Nicholson, 1972), 64?73. 86 Neltje Blanchan, How to Attract the Birds; and Other Talks about Bird Neighbors (New York : Doubleday, Page and Company, 1902), 208?9. 87 Palmer, "Danger of Introducing Noxious Animals and Birds," no, 107-8.</page><page sequence="23">English Sparrows, Immigrants, and the Nature of Fear 45 3 more instrumental in fostering disenchantment with species transfer and providing the impetus for legislative action than the English sparrow.88 Though the sparrow's impact on crop yields supplied the main impulse for remedial action, its "crimes" against native birds aroused the strongest public feelings. The superiority of native birds had long been an article of faith for the American cultural nationalist. Eco-jingoists among the post Revolutionary generation of thinkers and writers chastised their peers for neglecting familiar local materials in their obsession with the exotic.89 Alexander Wilson, a Scottish immigrant who became the most renowned American ornithologist prior to Audubon, praised the bluebird for its lovely voice, "pleasing" manners and prodigious consumption of nasty insects. He regretted that "no pastoral muse has yet risen in this western, woody world, to do justice to his name, and endear him to us still more by the tenderness of verse, as has been done to his representative in Britain, the Robin Redbreast."90 This chauvinistic thrust was particularly evident during the "literary war" in which the nightingale and skylark were "singled out for literary slaughter."91 Bryant may have been gung-ho about the sparrow in the late 1850s, but in 1832 he rebuked his brother for enthusing over the skylark because it was "an English bird, and an American who has never visited Europe has no right to be in raptures about it. "92 After the Civil War these feelings became more widely shared as part of a growing appreciation of the nation's fading complement of native nature. The nation's best-known nature writer, John Burroughs, praised the robin as "one of the most native and democratic of our birds; he is one of the family and seems much nearer to us than those rare, exotic visitants." And Blanchan welcomed the native song sparrow's tune as "ever the simple, homely, sweet melody that every good American has learned to love in childhood.

"94 According to William T. Hornaday, a New Yorker who was the leading wildlife protectionist of his day, the worst crime of this "national sorrow" was to crowd out native birds ("its betters").95 The scrupulously clean white dove that graced buildings such as Boston's Trinity Church served as the sparrow's moral opposite within Osgood's "Christian ornithology." Its urban presence set a noble, much-needed example to unruly city dwellers.96 Now these wholesome and uplifting natives found themselves forced to "emigrate to other quarters,"97 giving a new twist to the expression "flight to the suburbs." Yet not even in a "more retired neighborhood" (Olive Thorne Miller) were native birds safe from molestation.98 And critics considered the sparrow that intruded into the leafy suburbs to be as much out of place as an immigrant who had strayed beyond the tenements.99 A woman who lived on an estate on the Hudson immediately to the north of New York City saw it as her duty to "banish to the city the little pests." She identified herself as a direct descendant of John James Audubon ? the naturalist whose Birds of America (1838), a magisterial celebration of the magnificence of American bird life, exposed the folly of European taunts about the impoverished, degenerate condition of American fauna. Then she harked back to the American struggle for independence, and alluded to the longer history of conflict between tyrannical conservatives and freedom-loving liberals. English sparrows, she insisted, were "as much the enemies of our birds as ever Tories were of Whigs."100 "Strangers," asserted Coues, "whether human or faunal, were in possession of the native's former haunts." And these "sturdy little foreign vulgarians" were depriving "our" American birds of "certain inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness after their own fashion. " The "plucky little natives"- who, "like their human brethren, become strongly attached to the homes of their nativity " ?initially gave a good account of themselves, Gentry explained, in their struggle to defend home 94 Osgood, "English Sparrow," 324, 319. 95 Hornaday, Our Vanishing Wild Life, 334. 96 Osgood, 323.

"103 In Eurasia a pair produces between three and five fledglings annually. While expanding across North America, though, the average was twenty-four. "Horde" - with its Asiatic roots and connotations of nomadic savages wreaking havoc as they roamed at will ? was an extremely common descriptor of undesirable immigrants at this time. "Swamping" was also a key term in the nativist's verbal arsenal and Prescott Hall was reminded of the sparrow when contemplating the consequences of high immigrant reproductive rates for America's "superior" classes. The nation's British stock, he maintained, were voluntarily checking their reproductivity (a phenomenon known as "race suicide"), fearing a bleak future for their children in a nation increasingly dominated by non-British aliens.104 What was the remedy? Frustrated sparrow opponents sought to re vitalize a stressed native nature through acts of purgation.105 "Ship them all home," insisted William Walsh of Brooklyn. Do native songbirds a big favour by shooting the "bad" English sparrow whenever you can, recommended Mabel Osgood Wright, the founder of the Connecticut Audubon Society (and author of genteel books such as The Garden of a Commuter's Wife). "Strike," enjoined Gentry, in the name of rational science and patriotism, until "the last foe expires." Mindful, perhaps, of how urban consumption was depleting the passenger pigeon population, others emphasized the bird's culinary merits as an incentive. "The sooner legislative protection is repealed in this country and young America let loose upon them to convert them into pot-pies the better," advised the Indiana Farmer 101 Elliott Coues and D.

By 1902, however, ten states had adopted laws that extended protection to native songbirds, whether insectivorous or not, yet specifically excluded the English sparrow and categories of "bad" natives such as granivorous flock feeders.107 The most fervent sparrow opponents also sought protection for raptors and other birds that preyed on sparrows. Though Jennifer Price did not map these connections in her captivating discussions of passenger pigeon pies, hats festooned with dead birds and the campaigning fervour of female bird protectionists, the English sparrow and immigrant controversies were part of the larger debate over the thinning ranks of native birds. Protectionists, male and female, identified an assort ment of guilty parties: pot hunters, market hunters (particularly those working for the plume trade), stylish ladies, specimen collectors, callous city lads (gamins) armed with sling shots, blacks (in the South), immigrants (in the North) and, last but by no means least, English sparrows. By the mid-1880s many conservationists had targeted the millinery business as the gravest threat to American birds. So had the British Consul at Baltimore and farmers and horticulturists who rued the demise of useful insect-eaters. Hornaday did not entirely absolve the Anglo-American "lady of fashion." And the Times reported that native birds had "vanished forever" thanks to both milliners and the sparrow.108 For patrician New Yorkers, however, blacks and foreigners posed an even bigger menace. The fight to conserve native race and native nature had found a common enemy. "You might just as well cut down four twenty-inch trees and let them lie and decay, as to permit one woodpecker to be killed and eaten by an Italian in the North," Hornaday reflected on the native bird's high economic value (not least as enemy of non-native pests such as the codling moth and boll weevil).109 He warned that Italians "rapidly filling up" the United States in 1912 were importing beastly attitudes towards defenceless songbirds. He instructed game commissioners and wardens, state legislators and judicial officials to pay particularly close attention to a lurid British 48, io8; Indiana Farmer, 27 December 1884, Riley, Box 14, Scrapbook 58.

"no Hornaday drew a defiant line between America's shores and the barbarism beyond: "Antonio shall not come to this country with [his] song-bird tastes ... and indulge them here!" He then took aim at the republican hunting ethos for instilling the belief in "every foreigner who ... lands on our liberty-ridden shore, " that " now, at last, he can do as he pleases ! "m The first thing the male immigrant did to demonstrate his release from Old World tyranny, Hornaday insisted, was to buy a gun and go for wildlife that was up for grabs. To make matters worse, the most avid and depraved of immigrant hunters ? Italians ? were " spreading, spreading, spreading. If you are without them to-day, to-morrow they will be around you. "112 Not content with preying on American homes and jobs, the Italian "invades your fields, and even your lawn," to take a pot shot at all kinds of native bird, however tiny.113 Hornaday advocated state bans on the ownership, possession, or discharge of firearms by aliens and a proscription on their use for hunting by any naturalized alien from southern Europe resident in the United States less than ten years.114 Like the defenders of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe, the sparrow's supporters counterattacked with accusations of blatant prejudice and defamation. Thomas Brewer, the bird's leading proponent, grounded his views in his observations of bird life on Boston Common, on whose edge he resided. Conjuring up images of a happy, vibrant nation defined by immigration, he portrayed the northeastern city as a site of touching fraternity between native sparrows (hitherto rarely seen in cities, 110 Hubert D. Astley, "A Roccolo in Italy," AviculturalMagazine, 3, 3 (January 1912), 81, 83; Hornaday, foreword, 95, 98, 96. 111 Hornaday, ioi (emphasis in original). 112 Hornaday, 95?98, 100, 105, 101, 102. 113 Though Hornaday did not directly compare Italians with English sparrows, he drew a parallel with an alarming alien species that had terrorized the West Indies, but which, mercifully, was not yet resident on the American mainland: "Toward wild life, the Italian laborer is a human mongoose. Give him power to act, and he will quickly exterminate every wild thing that wears feathers or hair. " English sparrow and Indian mongoose were often twinned, though, the former serving as a stark warning to those tempted to import the latter. See Edward M. Earle, "The Mungoose in Jamaica," Forest and Stream, 39 (28 July 1892), 69; "The Biological Survey," Science, 26, 678 (27 December 1907), 914. 114 Hornaday, 103. Prompted by the injuring and even killing of game wardens by subsistence hunting Italians, Pennsylvania enacted legislation in 1906 barring gun ownership or possession by non-naturalized immigrants.

As for the familiar complaint that sparrows "drove off" the bluebird, it was more a case of an intolerant native refusing to extend hospitality to the newcomer.115 Meanwhile, Robson accused Coues of keeping quiet about the American jay's bullying of small, insectivorous native songbirds.116 And insofar as native populations were declining in some areas, supporters stressed that the sparrow had become a scapegoat for changes inimical to native avifauna associated with rapid urbanization that were in full swing long before the sparrow flew into town. To reinforce his point that allegations were mostly unsubstantiated, the author of a British article reprinted in a Boston weekly invited his readers to ponder the impression that a foreigner visiting England for the first time would form if the first natives he encountered happened to be swarthy : "The English are singularly dark in complexion; indeed, they might be described as tawny rather than fair!" Flimsy generalizations like this, he declared, had rendered the humble sparrow the most mud-"bespattered" of all birds.117 However, the case for the sparrow in the 1890s was most memorably put by the American poet George Horton. His maudlin ode "To an English Sparrow" freely conceded that its singing was inferior to that of native songsters. But where were those fickle "visitors sweet" of June when most needed in the depths of soulless winter? Deploying humanizing metaphors as liberally as the bird's opponents, he thanked the "brave, saucy Briton" for its nerve and loyalty: "you stayed." This cheerful tenacity gave him the opportunity to recast its notoriety as a "fighter" in a more sym pathetic light.118 In fact, the survival instincts of the "tough little Britons" with their "bull-dog courage" threatened to melt the hearts of even their harshest detractors.119 Though derided as sentimentalists and "so-called humanitarians," the likes of Horton presented wildlife conservationists seeking to arouse the public to ruthless action against the sparrow with a considerable dilemma. For the selective incitement of violence against it sat uncomfortably with efforts to expose wanton cruelty against other (native) birds and nurture tenderness towards them.

Each bird shall nip him. He shall grow small by degrees and beautifully less, until the last thread of his garment and the last hair of his head shall be borne away in triumph to line the nest in which a valiant sparrow shall give its now native country another brood of these vigorous workers !120 Half a century after the first introductions, debate pivoted increasingly on whether the bird was receiving a "square deal in our Land of Liberty." The desire to cleanse the United States of English sparrows struck some as contrary to the essential American creed of tolerance and equal justice for all. "Under the constitution," cautioned one of Blanchan's correspondents, the sparrow was " entitled to his attorney and his day in court. "121 Her own views had mellowed considerably between the publication of How to Attract the Birds (1902) and American entry into the First World War. By 1917, she felt, native birds had had sufficient time to adapt to "the ways of these foreigners in their midst, just as, happily, we humans have had to learn to live tolerantly and peaceably with Jews, Italians, Slavs, and many other European immigrants whose virtues were not at first appreciated. "122 What now worried her most was the effect on American children of sparrow-hatred and the official endorsement of eradication campaigns. Coues had regarded the very youngsters that he sought to mould into guardians of native birds as potential recruits in the sparrow war. The main character in Citizen Bird (1897), a book he co-wrote with Wright, was a naturalist who opens the eyes of his niece and nephew and their friends to the delights of American birds, all of which he encouraged them to cherish - with the exception of the English sparrow.123 And in the fall of 1916 the New York City-based League of American Sportsmen raised the chilling prospect of the English sparrow as the sole representative of birdlife in America. To forestall this nightmarish scenario the league's founder and president advocated nationwide extermination (citing the successful local campaign against the "British intruder" launched in 1915 in San Diego, where the sparrow had arrived as recently as 1913).124 120 Henry Ward Beecher, "Star Paper," The Christian Union, 16 (8 Aug. 1877), 103. 121 As quoted in Neltje Blanchan, "Prussianizing the Campaign Against Sparrows," The New Country Fife, 32 (Sept. 1917), 82. 122 Ibid., 82. 123 Wright and Coues, Citizen Bird, 182, 203-4. 124 "Plan to Wipe Out English Sparrow," NYT, 15 September 1916, 17.</page><page sequence="30">460 Peter Coates A precedent like this was precisely the sort of action that aroused Blanchan's anxiety. Alluding to the German invasion of Belgium, she wondered whether the human race was "good enough to withstand the brutalizing effect of wantonly torturing and killing even a sparrow. " (Bear in mind, she entreated, that the sparrow was often the only bird that American children fated to grow up in large cities ever saw.) Authorization to persecute it could therefore "Prussianize" these young Americans, who then "might just as well grow up in Berlin. "125 Whether the growing rapprochement with Britain in the wake of the Venezuela crisis (prompted, not least, by a shared sense of an emerging German threat), the flourishing of a British American variety of Anglo Saxonism or the eventual wartime partnership moderated attitudes to the English sparrow is hard to measure.126 As early as 1884 Robson had urged "anti-sparrow men" to abandon their "foolish prejudices" and drop their "cruel crusades" because "you can not extradite him, for like yourselves and numbers more of his countrymen, he has come here to stay."127 Most sparrow critics knew full well, long before 1900, that though they might chalk up the occasional local victory they were never going to win the war.128 The American author of a 1900 essay about the demise of native avifauna compared American callousness with the "love and protection" that the English ("from peer to peasant") showered on their birds. Deploring-in more or less equal measure ? the depredations of the English sparrow ("little pirate") and man ("the real 'bird of prey'") on native American birdlife, Eugene Rolfe recommended following the British lead, so often disparaged by Americans. For "even the gamin of London," he reported, 125 Blanchan, "Prussianizing the Campaign," 82. 126 On this growing intimacy see Anna Maria Martellone, " In the Name of Anglo-Saxondom, for Empire and for Democracy: The Anglo-American Discourse, 1880-1920," in Reflections on American Exceptionalism, ed. David K. Adams and Cornells A. van Minnen (Keele: Ryburn, 1994), 83-96. 121 Prairie Farmer, 13 September 1884. Pooh-poohing all the fuss over the sparrow, an Englishman living in New York City in the 1870s remarked on the relatively modest size of the American population, pointing out that numbers back in Britain were ten times larger ("N.D.," letter to the editor, NYT, 8 September 1878). This ratio has since become reversed. Though the sparrow's North American population has declined by 2.5 per cent annually since 1966, there are still over ten times as many in the United States as in Britain. 128 Besides, though the bird was naturalized across most of the continent, its onslaught was running out of steam. The switch from horse power to electric trolleys in the 1890s, and eventually to motorized vehicles, dramatically affected sparrow numbers ; far fewer piles of manure and pools of spilled grain littered city streets meant far fewer sparrows.</page><page sequence="31">English Sparrows, Immigrants, and the Nature of Fear 461 "is fain to share his crust with the birds of the park."129 He did not point out, though, that most of those blessed English birds were his con founded English sparrows. As a leading British naturalist explained shortly before 1900, the "little brown-coated crowd" had "conquered" London too.130 Nor was Rolfe aware that the American "sparrow war" was part of a transatlantic phenomenon whose British front had opened two decades earlier than American hostilities and which also peaked in the 1890s.131 A British book about the sparrow, subtitled The Avian Rat (1899), urged readers to "save the bread of the people from these feathered robbers." Denouncing the bird as a parasite that failed to live in a "natural manner," the authors even queried its British identity. A bird of indeterminate origins, it had "no natural location" in Britain.132 Despite the occasional dig at the Irish, however, pejorative references to nationality - obviously - were a lesser feature of Britain's sparrow war, which focussed on the damage inflicted on corn and other crops. Yet it was no less bitterly fought and also featured bloodthirsty calls for extermination. Letters to the London Times protesting against wholesale "murder" by "sparrow clubs" expressed revulsion at the annual dinners of these " ornithocide " societies, which distributed cash prizes (between the cheese and the dessert courses) to members who had killed the greatest and second highest number over the preceding year.133 The ferocity and duration of the sparrow war in the bird's homeland casts valuable light on its American counterpart. As well as reminding us not to neglect material considerations as we seek to extract cultural value from this topic, a comparative perspective serves to underline the mallea bility of the sparrow's symbolic value. Insofar as attitudes to the sparrow tell us as much about people as they do about the sparrow, the bird's immigrant identity appears, at first, to have been the main explanation for 129 Eugene Strong Rolfe, "The Passing of the Birds," New EnglandMagazine, 22 (June 1900), 416, 419. 130 W.

Yet some of its enemies were perfectly happy to import British birds such as the skylark. A closer look indicates that the lower-class and urban identity invariably assigned to it was also a major sticking point. This emphasis on social status and place of residence rather than nationality per se ? to the extent that these categories can be separated at a time when many immigrants were working-class urbanit?s ? is supported by a comparative dimension. That British commentators often appraised their own bird in identical fashion to American observers of similar social rank reminds us that the assignation of pejorative human qualities to animals is by no means restricted to non-native species.134 But unless we look beyond economic and ecological considerations to meanings that submerge their identities as flesh, blood and feathered entities, it is hard to explain the depth of feelings once aroused by a small, unremarkable bird to which few Americans today would give a second thought.135 134 The most notorious victim of negative humanization in Europe and North America has probably been the indigenous wolf. See Peter Coates, '"Unusually Cunning, Vicious and Treacherous': The Extermination of the W?lfin United States History," in The Massacre in History, ed. Mark Levene and Penny Roberts (Oxford: Berghahn Books, 1999), 167-70, I?3'. 135 Until a few years ago, few Britons gave the sparrow much thought either. Then the press was suddenly awash with stories about the dramatic sudden decline in sparrow numbers, from traditional urban haunts to suburbia and the countryside. Responding to a feeling that an essential part of the nation's natural (and urban) heritage was under threat, the Independent newspaper (15 May 2000) offered ?5,000 to the person who could explain the mysterious demise of this "cultural emblem." The story was even picked up in the United States. See, for example, Robyn Dixon, "Silent Warning? Sparrows are Vanishing Throughout Great Britain," Eos Angeles Times, 12 July 2002, at: http://www.ecology.com/ eco...o2/articles. As for current American attitudes to the sparrow, it is worth noting that the New York Public Library's recent (11 October 2000 to 1 February 2003) exhibition Urban Neighbors: Images of New York City Wildlife, featured the house (as distinct from English) sparrow in the section entitled "Street and Backyard Neighbors" rather than in "Unwelcome Neighbors" ("animals for whom almost no one has a good word").</page></plain_text>
