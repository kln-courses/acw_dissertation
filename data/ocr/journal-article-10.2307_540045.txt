<plain_text><page sequence="1">TIMOTHY J. MITCHELL Bullfighting The Ritual Origin of Scholarly Myths Logical and methodological errors abound in what currently passfor authoritative analyses of the Spanish bullfight: misuse offolklore, misapplication of Spanish notions of honor and masculinity, cavalier disregardfor the explanations of the people who actually stage the events, and manifest intolerance of cultural ambiguities. Research will proceed in productive directions when the matador's performance is distinguishedfrom the psychocultural elaborations it elicits. Myth and Craft BULLFIGHTING IS AN ACTIVITY THAT OVERFLOWS the traditional generic cate- gories of folklore. It exhibits characteristics of a folk craft, a folk ritual, a game, and a festival. It paradoxically meets Barre Toelken's criteria for both folk arts and fine arts (1979:182-186). It is a mass spectacle and an "agrobusiness" at the same time. For centuries it has been the inspiration or subject matter of ballads, legends, poems, plays, paintings, novels, and films. It has been, with the pos- sible exception of the Inquisition, the major focus of other nations' exoteric lore about Spaniards and their alleged national character. And it has generated a vast number of erudite, ambitious, and often improbable interpretations. Modern social scientists have tended to confuse matters even more, simulta- neously mystifying the unequivocal essence of tauromachy and oversimpli- fying the labyrinthine cultural reverberations of the bullfight-event. In this ar- ticle I argue that bullfighting is not the hypermasculine metaphor it has been made out to be, and I suggest constructive directions for future research. Early scholarly "myths" of bullfighting were, appropriately enough, myths of origin. The 18th and 19th centuries witnessed the struggle between the Roman Circus theory originally propagated by Golden Age theologians and the Moorish thesis propounded by Moratfn and popularized by Goya. A nativist position eventually found an apologist in the Count of Las Navas (L6- pez-Valdemoro 1900). All three hypotheses were eclipsed following a major exposition of ancient bovine artifacts organized in 1918 by the Count of Las Almenas and several archaeologists, thanks to which man's fight with the bull came to be seen as pre-Castillian, pre-Moorish, pre-Roman, and altogether TimothyJ.

For the first time, the bullfight was linked to the sacrifices primi- tive peoples had made to their divinities, and, according to Alvarez de Miranda (1962:40), the revelation was nothing short of sensational. Only a few years later, Sir Arthur Evans's use of Spanish terms to describe certain taurine im- ages he had unearthed at Knossos fanned the fires of the revolutionary "Neo- lithic" thesis. Archaeologists of several different nationalities subsequently elaborated the Cretan-origins hypothesis of Iberian tauromachy; one even ar- gued that Theseus was the first bullfighter, and the Labyrinth was in reality the sacrificial dance of the Minotaur (Alvarez de Miranda 1962:45-46). The ritual explanation of the bullfight was well entrenched among Spanish intel- lectuals active in the 1920s and 1930s. Some, like Unamuno, found cause for malaise therein; others, like Lorca, adopted an attitude of mystical affirmation. The bullfight was also a prime target for the libidinal hermeneutics of the early 20th century. Maurice Barres had already sung the voluptuous nature of bloody deaths in Spanish bullrings (1894); by the 1920s Freudianism had been successfully welded onto the sacrificial view of tauromachy-"Gross comedy of blood, sex, dionysian and sadistic; the ancient rites of the brute and of the Christ meet here in the final image of stability" (Frank 1926:236). In his satir- ical Relato immoral, Fernandez Florez saw bullfighting as the first and easiest demonstration of Freud's pertinence to Spanish life (1927:240-241). His tongue-in-cheek remarks on the essential femininity of the matador were to be taken in deadly earnest by later exegetes. The climax was reached with Ba- taille's surrealist melange of eyes, eggs, gorings, and orgasms in Histoire d'oeil (1928). Another major line of attack was initiated by Perez de Ayala and consoli- dated in 1930 by Bergamin, whose El arte de birlibirloque vindicates bullfighting as a fount of the most sublime aesthetic emotions, available to a chosen elect of spectators with properly cultivated sensibilities. These diverse trends (the bullfight as sacrifice, fine art, sex act, or sex crime) were brilliantly fused by Michel Leiris in his Miroir de la tauromachie (1964[1937]). This French ethnologist and belletrist took the bullfight as a starting point for a series of meditations concerning the role of transgression in the erotic, the aesthetic, and the sacred. The romantic exaltation of Spain's sanguinary customs was temporarily laid to rest by the awesome destruction of the Civil War (1936-39). Taurine studies entered a new era with the historical investigations ofJose Maria de Cossio, whose importance for later scholarship cannot be overestimated. It was not until Cossio published the first volume of his encyclopedia (1943), for example, that the bullfight came to be understood within the context of the hundreds of patronal festivals that form the backbone of Spanish folk religion (637-688). The variety of ways in which bulls are manhandled in these tradi- tional fiestas was further explored by the Revista de Dialectologia y Tradiciones Populares (RDTP), founded in 1945, which published important studies by Julio Caro Baroja, Hoyos Sainz, Garcia Matos, Vicente Risco, and other major Spanish folklorists. The idea that bulls were fundamental to magic rural fer- 395</page><page sequence="3">TIMOTHYJ. MITCHELL tility rites was first advanced by Casas Gaspar (1950) and found its most suc- cinct formulation in Alvarez de Miranda (1962). Alvarez de Miranda began by analyzing a number of defunct Spanish leg- ends and folktales that associated the bull with miraculous transformations of women into men, or homosexuals into heterosexuals, and with magical anti- dotes for feminine infertility (1962:59-87). He found that such "myths" were outnumbered by similarly defunct Spanish folk rituals that actively and prag- matically sought to exploit the sexual magic of the bull that the stories ex- pressed. One of these rites allowed him to develop the first coherent if not entirely plausible theory of the folk origins of the modern bullfight. Instead of tracing it to the aristocratic and equestrian one which preceded it, as did Cossio and other historians, Alvarez de Miranda traced both to an archaic wedding custom that called for bride and groom to infuriate a bull with darts and spot their garments with his blood (1962:89-113). He went on to argue that each of the three suertes or "acts" of the modern taurine performance derived from some element or episode of the fiesta of the nuptial bull (1962:115-131). How- ever, since this custom did not lead to the death of the bull but was only in- tended to evoke his fecundating power by ritually spilling his blood, Alvarez de Miranda concluded that the suerte de matar (act of killing the bull) in modern bullfights really derived from the internal logic of knightly tauromachy, al- ready a secularized, ludic deformation of the original folk ritual (1962:109). Thus he subverted one of the major "mythemes" of pre-Cossio taurine his- torians, especially the enthusiasts of the Neolithic and Cretan theses, who were sure that the bullfight reflected the archetypal blood sacrifice of one ancient bull cult or another. "The great paradox of Spanish bullfighting," Alvarez de Miranda asserted, "is that only when it ceased to be a sacral question did it begin to seem a sacrifice" (1962:110). This distinction has been ignored by more recent researchers who make the most of Alvarez de Miranda's data and magico-sexual hypotheses. I think modern bullfighting can best be understood as an unusually dynamic variety of folk craft rather than a profane survival of folk ritual. It constitutes a traditional body of knowledge and practices transmitted orally through something like an apprentice system. It requires a highly sophisticated under- standing of animal behavior, adherence to very specific norms and procedures, and a fair degree of nerve in carrying them out. This is not an interpretation of bullfighting but a definition; interpretation begins with the use each bull- fighter makes of the tradition, his physical and mental abilities, his style, his capacity for innovation or his respect for orthodoxy. This traditional craft or technology produces no artifact, which might seem to exclude it from the sphere of material culture altogether. A dead bull is what remains at the end of the process, but it is the skill with which that death is administered that constitutes the raison d'etre of the matador's performance and its one valid aes- thetic criterion. We are thus dealing with a folk craft that paradoxically be- longs in the sphere of "temporal" culture. The bullfight is Bruce Jackson's online, nonreplicable activity par excellence (ackson 1985:132-138).' 396</page><page sequence="4">RITUAL ORIGIN OF SCHOLARLY MYTHS Bullfighting is possible in the first place because an isolated and frightened toro bravo usually flees head first in a straight line. Beyond this basic character- istic, individual bulls vary greatly in their behavior and no two are ever exactly alike. The history of bullfighting is the history of the development of ever more efficient techniques for controlling the animal raw material. The first professional bullfighters were 18th-century slaughterhouse employees who al- ready knew a lot about bovid behavior and who discovered that they could earn more money by doing their job in public. According to Garcia-Baquero, Romero de Solis, and Vazquez Parlade (1980), it was the then-dominant guild system that served as the model for turning the original folk technology into a profession, as evidenced by (1) the drive to submit every one of the suertes of the bullfight to strict reglamentation; (2) hierarchism, with a particular nomen- clature for each of the successive ranks or specializations (picador, banderillero, mozo de estoques, etc.), as well as rigid observance of seniority and a clearly defined period of apprenticeship for young novilleros; and (3) the drive to get governmental authorities to guarantee the exclusivism of the new profession and the strict imposition of the ordinances (Garcia-Baquero et al. 1980:99- 109). Diaz Yanes has argued that few other groups in 18th- and 19th-century Spain were as committed as bullfighters were to the ideal of professional per- fection, pushed onwards by a ferocious degree of internal criticism and the will to submit every kind of bull to the intelligence of the bullfighter (Diaz Yanes 1983:234-239). This ideal of technical progress eventually enabled bullfighters to shift from basically defensive ways of handling the bull to more offensive ones. Generations of selective breeding changed the bull as well, making him increasingly "noble" (i.e., cooperative). With time, bullfighters learned to correct the defects of the particular bull that emerged from the chiquero into the ring, teaching him, as it were, to charge in a way that permitted his human opponent to demonstrate his skill, valor, and arte. Aesthetic concerns, derived directly from the nature of the craft, accompanied this evolution every step of the way: What kind of play is a specific bull capable of and with what degree of skill does the matador play upon this ever-changing quality? Aesthetic standards grow out of technical ones and are largely interchange- able for the "close group" of the matador and his party. The strictly masculine minisociety of the cuadrilla, rooted in the archaic laboral practices that still in- filtrate so much of Spanish society, has yet to be given the attention it deserves in taurine exegesis. The popular exaltation of the matador blinds many to the fact that tauromachy is always and everywhere a group activity-each man with a role to play, clear-cut obligations and privileges, and a semifeudal loy- alty to his captain. Many other groups participate in the bullfight-event, and it might be con- venient to see them as so many concentric rings of seats surrounding the cir- cular enclosure where the cuadrilla performs. The aficionados might be defined as the closest group, one which understands the problems of the bullfighting craft, and which shares the technical/aesthetic concerns of the bullfighters and their historic passion for perfection. This group is not to be confused, though 397</page><page sequence="5">TIMOTHYJ. MITCHELL it sometimes overlaps, with the taurinos or fans, the unconditional supporters of a single bullfighter who stake their group identity on his charisma. The "way to watch" a bullfight most in accord with its vocational essence is ac- cessible to a minority of spectators only. Specialized knowledge, an unima- ginably rich and esoteric vocabulary, broad experience, and a discriminating sensibility-these are the characteristics of the true aficionado. No anthropol- ogist who wants to talk about sacrifice or sex will have much sympathy with the endless discussion of technical details aficionados are given to-bracing in the attack, the distinction between natural and changed bullfighting, the proper execution of such and such a suerte, whether or not the bull was prop- erly picced, and so forth. But it is here that we will find, boring or not for outsiders, the real "essence" of bullfighting. Yet another group has formed around this one, the critics and journalists whose livelihoods derive from bullfighting's economic dynamism. The best critics have played an essential role in the technical and artistic progress of the profession.2 It is precisely this progress which has enabled another group, chiefly comprised of 20th-century belletrists, to "discover" that tauromachy is a fine art, a geometry, or a metaphysical combination of both. This group has managed to redeem bullfighting from its former ill repute among intellec- tuals even though their high-flown aesthetic standards are basically foreign to those of the closer groups. But it is yet another group of true outsiders, often nonnatives, who have developed interpretations of the bullfight-event that differ most radically from the explanations of the people actually involved in it. Earlier I discussed a num- ber of fanciful theories pertaining to the genesis of tauromachy-veritable myths derived from the study of a ritual. These excesses do not necessarily mean that outsiders' evaluations are bound to miss the mark. As long as the testimony of insiders is given some small measure of attention, outsiders' per- spectives which seek to establish broad comparisons between the bullfight and other institutions or values peculiar to Spanish culture or its Mediterranean context can be useful to a majority of Hispanists, folklorists, and social sci- entists in general. Let us turn our attention to a number of studies that purport to do just that. Bullfights and Metaphors In a recent article in American Ethnologist, Carrie B. Douglass asserts that "the bullfight is a metaphor that makes a statement about the social order," inasmuch as the social order is often represented by a sexual one and "the bull- fighter is to the bull as man is to woman" (Douglass 1984:242-243). Honor, construed in sexual terms, is "the key to the interpretation of the Spanish bull- fight" (1984:242). I argue that ideologically, at least, the bull is female, an animal structurally equivalent to a woman. The role of the male is to control, contain, and finally kill the bull. I show that the 398</page><page sequence="6">RITUAL ORIGIN OF SCHOLARLY MYTHS popular image of females in (southern) Spain is that if not controlled by men, they are extremely dangerous and upsetting to the social order due to their sexual nature. It is through the treatment of the bull and the transference of language usually reserved for the toro bravo and the bullfight to women and the erotic relations between the sexes that the parallels between the bull and the female can be seen. [Douglass 1984:243] Douglass limits her purview to southern Spain and thereby eliminates most of the provinces where the bullfight is held, but her hypothesis is arresting enough to merit close consideration. Her evidence is mainly metaphorical and linguistic in nature and derives almost entirely from Spanish sociologist E. Tierno Galvan, who pointed out various ways taurine vocabulary can be used in a sexual context (1961[1951]:60-64). Tierno found that "the Spaniard" often employs bullfight terminology to characterize a woman of striking physique or to refer to his urge to dominate her. Douglass attempts to buttress this in- formation with the proverb "toro muerto, vaca es," which she uses as the title for her article and translates as "the dead bull is a cow." "Through domina- tion," explains Douglass, "the wildly potent and mortally dangerous bull is identified with what is socially female" (1984:251). But in actual usage this saying does not refer to the bullfight, nor to the brave bull, nor to male-female relations. Best translated as "dead bull is cow," the phrase derives from the fact that the meat of a dead bull is prepared, packaged, and sold in exactly the same way as cow meat, and is used in contexts similar to those of the English "six of one and a half-dozen of the other." It is used to indicate the triviality of certain distinctions and is the structural opposite of 'jabon e hilo negro, todo es para la ropa" (soap or black thread, everything is for clothes) which is used to mock those who fail to discern differences that are important. Douglass falls into graver error with the one-way metaphorical evidence she borrows from Tierno. "What does it mean," asks Tierno, "that the Spaniard sees the conquest and possession of a woman the same as he sees the conquest and defeat of a brave bull?" (1961[1951]:61; emphasis mine). Tierno does not inquire as to whether the Spanish woman sees matters in the same light and neither does Douglass. But a cursory examination of Spanish folklore reveals that the metaphor is entirely interchangeable: both men and women can and do picture themselves as the bullfighter and the opposite sex as the bull. A few items from the taurine cancionero: Ven aquf, torico; Come here, little bull; ven aqui, galain, come here, gallant, que soy la torera [fem] for I am the bullfighter que te va a matar. that is going to kill you. Cuando me citas, When you "cite" me, me siento toro bravo, I feel like a brave bull, nifia bonita. pretty girl. Con la capa el torero With the cape the bullfighter maneja al bicho, handles the beast, y la mujer al hombre and the woman handles the man con su abanico. with her fan. 399</page><page sequence="7">TIMOTHYJ. MITCHELL Si me ves con otro hablando, If you see me with another man, no dudes de mi querer, do not doubt my love, el hombre es siempre un toro the man is always a bull y un torero la mujer. and the bullfighter a woman.3 For every metaphor that pictures the woman as a wild creature who must be dominated and penetrated with a long instrument, there is another that pic- tures the man as a gullible patsy whose blind charges are easily governed by a woman. Moreover, only men can be called "cornudos" (horned ones or cuck- olds). But by no means should it be inferred, as Tierno and Douglass infer, that male-female relations constitute the main facet of life that taurine vocabulary has lent itself to. Cossio lists some 220 different sayings and metaphors derived from the bullfight, the characteristics of the bull, and the bullfighter, no more than 10 of which make some connection with female appearance or sex rela- tions (Cossio 1947:232-242). Far more common are phrases that refer to de- ception, difficult or dangerous situations in general, skill, anger, and so forth. Even Tierno recognizes the existence of other spheres of application (1961:51). To Cossio's list can be added the use that Catholic priests have made of taurine terms to portray the truths of the faith, a custom that goes back several cen- turies (Pereda 1965:24-32). The bullfight, for its part, has borrowed a number of ecclesiastical terms to refer to different aspects or moments of the perfor- mance (Arauz de Robles 1978:155-156). Perez de Ayala (1963, Book One) de- scribed the Spanish political scene in taurine terms and vice versa. Bullfighting and arteflamenco have exchanged a considerable number of concepts and terms (Quinones and Vega 1982; Gonzalez Climent 1953, 1964). Any sphere of cul- ture can give and take words to and from any other; it does not follow that therefore some profound structural connection exists. Douglass refers to Tierno as the one scholar who "has seen the event of the bullfight in its fun- damental and principal essence as a confrontation between male and female" (Douglass 1984:252). Tierno does nothing of the sort; while indicating that taurine vocabulary lends itself to sex relations, he does not turn around and assert that therefore sex relations are the essence of the bullfight. This is Doug- lass's own hasty non sequitur, compounded by a tortuous analysis of "the Spanish Honor Code" (1984:254). "The bull is not female," she explains. "Rather, in the relationship with the torero, it has the same structural position as woman in the Honor Code relationship between the sexes" (1984:254; em- phasis in original). The bullfight serves to reaffirm all social hierarchies, rea- sons Douglass, because it reaffirms the sexual one (1984:243). But does it in- deed? The only hierarchy that can be seen is a man's victory over an animal. From this real (not symbolic) domination, the notion of domination itself can be abstracted and applied to other relationships: man over woman or woman over man-depending upon your informant or which folksong you listen to; light over darkness; good over evil; guile over force; vertical over horizontal; plebeian over aristocrat; son over father; Christian over Moor; sacrificer over 400</page><page sequence="8">RITUAL ORIGIN OF SCHOLARLY MYTHS victim; life over death and death over life. I have encountered every one of these possibilities in one author or another, each claiming that his particular equation is the "key" to the bullfight.4 Julian Pitt-Rivers has managed to include several of these hermeneutic pos- sibilities in an analysis of the bullfight that eschews mundane attention to evi- dence for the higher proofs of anthropological intuition, artfully combining every 20th-century religious or sexual comparison made seriously or in jest with a few more he has discovered on his own. Contrary to Alvarez de Mi- randa, Pitt-Rivers maintains that the suerte de matar is truly a sacrifice and that the corrida in general is a religious rite (1984:27-47). The bullfighter initially appears as a feminine figure who artfully tricks the totally masculine bull into wasting his energy in useless charges; in the final suerte, this prepotent virility has passed into the bullfighter, who now dominates (at least in theory) the bull's every movement (1984:35). But if the matador kills clumsily, whatever points he may have earned earlier with elegant cape work will not prevent the jeers of the crowd. "This demonstrates that we are not dealing with a sport or a theatrical representation but with a sacrifice" (1984:36). When the matador finally plunges his sword into the bull's withers, he completes the process of humiliation and feminization with a symbolic rape (1984:38). But that is not all: since the "vagina-wound" between the bull's shoulder blades is thor- oughly bloodied (from the pic and the banderillas), Pitt-Rivers concludes that the bullfighter heroically breaks the taboo against copulation during men- struation at the moment he perpetrates his "rape" (1984:38-39). The symbolic violation of the [menstrual] taboo restores the natural rights of both sexes: freed of cultural bonds by the deed of the outlaw/hero, who allies himself with Nature, men are once again true men and, no longer fearful of women, the latter become authentic females, able to sign the peace in the war between the sexes. [Pitt-Rivers 1984:40] With Pitt-Rivers, the most prestigious modern anthropologist to take an in- terest in bullfighting, taurine studies have taken a major step backwards. He effectively resurrects the mystagogy and vulgar Freudianism of the 1920s un- der a thin veneer of structuralist terminology. He utilizes Alvarez de Miranda's research into the magic rites of the bull (Pitt-Rivers 1984:40-42) but omits mention of his predecessor's refusal to see any sexual or sacrificial significance in modern bullfighting (Alvarez de Miranda 1962:106-113)-a negation shared, incidentally, by other Spanish folklorists (G6mez-Tabanera 1968:295; Blazquez 1975:74). The fact that this traditional temporal craft is executed in public, with the performers dressed in a specified way and following the same specific routines, makes the bullfight seem like a ritual. But the insiders-cuadrilla, aficionados, critics-do not attribute any sort of symbolic meaning to their actions. In a true ritual, like the Mass, the officiant and his communicants are engaged in symbolic activity; their every word and action has an agreed-upon spiritual referent. Participants in a Mass take note of, but do not define as central, the 401</page><page sequence="9">TIMOTHYJ. MITCHELL skillfulness with which the priest elevates the chalice, or his style in distribut- ing hosts, or the aplomb with which he consecrates the blood of Christ. But in the "ritual" of the bullfight, the entire point is to evaluate the external be- havior of the "officiant." Skill, grace, and sang-froid are precisely the qualities on display and they do not stand for anything beyond themselves. Thus it would be-and is-ludicrous to place the bullfight on the same spiritual plane as the Mass, to call it a religious rite, a sacrifice, or a daring violation of the menstrual taboo. Even Michel Leiris exercised greater caution in this regard than Pitt-Rivers: the former began with the bullfight-event and followed it through risk, transgression, and erotic analogies to arrive at a novel conception of the sacred, emphasizing all along that he was constructing metaphors, searching for affinities, for resemblances, for mirrors (Leiris 1964[19371:23, 24, et passim). Pitt-Rivers begins with an erotic theory of the sacred and proceeds through a mechanical distortion of the data to "reveal" the true essence of the bullfight, its hidden reality, its fundamental structure. Leiris, furthermore, was intent upon developing a series of personal meditations; his work belongs to the genre of belles-lettres. But Pitt-Rivers wants his essay to have the status of fieldwork; he simultaneously converts his meditations into accomplished facts and attributes their invention to the natives themselves: "It remains to be seenjust how the Andalusians have found in the sacrifice of the bull the means to overcome the contradictions that complicate relations between the sexes in that region" (Pitt-Rivers 1984:44). Quod erat demonstrandum! Thus, to the logical error of taking the metaphor for the essence there cor- responds the methodological error of inventing the informant. Douglass con- fides that "the upper classes no doubt enjoyed the bullfight as a covert meta- phor for the relationship between the sexes and used the relationship between the sexes as a metaphor for the relationship between the classes" (1984:255). This is a succinct formulation of her own premise which she places into ribald aristocratic minds. Yet, in fairness to foreign anthropologists, it must be pointed out that Spanish sociologists have been no less predisposed to attribute their interpretations to hypothetical or fictitious subjects. I have already men- tioned Tierno's appropriation of "the Spaniard." Similarly, he claimed that "the taurine spectator" goes to bullfights in order to confirm his quasi-reli- gious faith in hombria (manhood) (1961[1951]:74-76). All taurine spectators? For Arauz de Robles, it is the greater glory of the masculine sex that "the pub- lic" really comes to enjoy at a bullfight (1978:177), or, a little more specifically, a traditional "Spanish Man" whose days are numbered (1978:178). Every de- tail of tauromachy as well as the folklore it elicits are to be understood in terms of pure machismo. What makes Arauz de Robles more refreshing, if no more reliable, than other taurine exegetes is his emphasis on the bullfight as a "vi- rility contest" (1978:182), in which a totally masculine bull bests a totally mas- culine horse and is subsequently vanquished by a totally virile matador (1978:183). The bullfight is "cosa de hombres," a narcissistic spectacle of, by, and for men wherein women are mere ornamental adjuncts (1978:185). 402</page><page sequence="10">RITUAL ORIGIN OF SCHOLARLY MYTHS The abuse of the hypothetical subject has been constant in the many psy- choanalytic interpretations that have been made of the bullfight over the years. Conrad asserted in The Horn and the Sword that it "may be thought of as a culturally sanctioned ritual through which culturally produced but repressed fears and frustrations find release and expression in displaced aggression against the bull as a symbol par excellence of power and authority" (1957:185). As the bullfighter dominates and dispatches the bull, "the Spaniards" uncon- sciously fantasize that their fathers, lords, bishops, and kings are all being done away with in the arena (1957:190-191). The Oedipus complex, the primal horde, ritual parricide, totemic feasts, and other familiar Freudian themes have all been brought to bear on the bullfight by Desmonde (1952), Ingham (1964), Betancourt (1970), or Gomez Pin (1981). "Tauromachy implicates the pub- lic," affirms the last, "because it implies fraternity, it implies the identification of the multitude with one-the bullfighter-who by killing the bull symbol- ically repeats the founding act of humanity" (Gomez Pin 1981:417). Psychoan- alytically minded researchers could search out the repressed reactions of real individuals who attend or have attended bullfights to discern what they might be projecting onto whom. But in practice they have preferred to project their own preconception of the bullfight's "meaning" onto an artificially con- structed recipient of said meaning, a fault they share with most other taurine exegetes. Bullfighting and Manhood For the sake of argument, let us momentarily overlook the logical and methodological failings of taurine exegetes and conjecture that perhaps, for some Spaniards in some regions, the bullfight is taken as a celebration of male supremacy or even as a covert sexual innuendo. Where might we look for such Spaniards? Following Pitt-Rivers and Douglass, we can initially confine our search to the eight provinces of Andalusia. We can then ask if attitudes akin to "machismo" are generalized there or if they are more prevalent in one social class than another. Gilmore and Gilmore have already provided a specific an- swer to this question: Andalusian machismo is found almost exclusively in "the subordinate lower class of landless day laborers" and constitutes a mech- anism whereby impoverished, uneducated, and politically impotent men "seek to disidentify from the powerful Andalusian mother figure and thereby to resolve intrapsychic gender identity conflict" (Gilmore and Gilmore 1979:281-283). In reviewing studies from the Mediterranean area in general, Saunders notes that it is mainly among proletarians that the idea of women as aggressive creatures who must be dominated receives greatest elaboration (1981:451). "If a man cannot validate his masculinity through the exercise of authority in the home," concludes Saunders, "he may-at least in theory- explore other ways of doing so" (1981:451). One of these ways may be the Carnival ritual. Gilmore and Gilmore analyze the Carnival songs composed by male proletarians and find them to be obsessed with images of women (usu- 403</page><page sequence="11">TIMOTHYJ. MITCHELL ally mothers-in-law) who are as powerful and hypersexual as wild beasts (1979:292-297). It might be inferred that such men could find in the bullfight another ritual statement of their anxieties and a ritual vindication of their threatened sense of manliness. This is precisely the inference that Pitt-Rivers and Douglass elevate to the status of ontology when they sever it from its one possible social base. Meanwhile, Perez Delgado finds that fantasy elaborations about the bullfighter are most intense among those Andalusians who cannot afford to go to bullfights (1978:863). So for the moment all we have is a hy- pothetical connection between a fantasy image of male domination and a fan- tasy image of the bullfight which might exist (consciously or unconsciously?) in the minds of an impossible-to-determine number of poor men in southern Spain. Douglass's conviction that upperclass men go to bullfights to gloat about dominated women or Pitt-Rivers's idea that Andalusian women yearn for a bullfighter to violate the menstrual taboo do not have any demonstrable basis in fact. Furthermore, Caro Baroja has emphasized that it is not the profes- sion, but the situation, of bullfighting that popular culture in Andalusia has elaborated: taurine heroes are almost always very young novilleros or martyrs fatally gored in the bullring (1983:18). Contrary to what we might have been led to suspect, totally virile, domineering types are as absent from Andalusian taurine mythopoesis as are realistic, professional types. Women, for their part, are commonly pictured as either remote beauties one glimpses in the palco of the aristocrats or maternal figures who worry about or mourn for the child- bullfighter (Claraumunt L6pez 1982:125-131)-not uncontrollable, devour- ing shrews thirsting for domination. The female companions of bullfighters are, in fantasy and "real life," flamenco singers and dancers (Quinones and Vega 1982:704-705). But let us suppose, for the sake of argument, that certain cultural notions of what it takes to be a real man lie behind a young man's decision to become a bullfighter. Suppose that these factors operate more intensely if he belongs to a social class that greatly prizes virility, male prepotence, feminine submis- sion, and simultaneously suffers poverty and social margination. In Spanish Gypsies Douglass could find a group of mostly southern Spaniards for whom the "Honor Code" is most directly related to virility in an almost exaggerated way (San Roman 1976). Furthermore, the list of Spanish Gypsies who have become major matadors is long and glorious. But aficionados and critics all agree that Gypsy bullfighting places very little emphasis on virility or valor (Sureda Molina 1967; Arauiz de Robles 1978:28-30; Quifiones and Vega 1982:706-708; Bergamin 1985:31-34). Hemingway noted of a great Gypsy bullfighter named Cagancho that "his cowardice at the moment of killing is disgusting ... a coldblooded gypsy defrauding of the public by the most shameless, anger-arousing obtainer of money under false pretenses, that ever went into a bullring" (1932:250). It turns out that Gypsies interpret bullfight- ing as a matter of style, of astuteness, of grace-all values that form an im- portant part of their culture (San Roman 1976:254-255). Even moments of panic and flight are prone to aesthetic elaboration. Machismo doesn't enter 404</page><page sequence="12">RITUAL ORIGIN OF SCHOLARLY MYTHS into the picture at all, but an elusive artistic/spiritual quality known as "duende" does. Andalusia is overrepresented in the ethnographic literature and this unfor- tunately enhances a long-standing tendency to see it as "typical Spain." Other areas of the Peninsula with climates less agreeable to tourists and researchers have a great many dealings with bulls; perhaps in these other regions we will find evidence of Tierno's generalized Spanish "faith in manhood," of some ideal concept of true masculinity or vulgar concept of cojones (slang for testi- cles). Such evidence might reasonably be sought in the fiestas de toros popular in rural and urban areas of northern, central, and eastern Spain. The "running of the bulls" in Pamplona is only the most famous example of what takes place in hundreds of folk festivals throughout both Castilles, Le6n, La Mancha, Ex- tremadura, Aragon, and Valencia, where communities ostensibly pay homage to their patron saints by stampeding and harassing bovids before slaughtering them and partaking of their flesh. Despite their diverse theoretical approaches, Spanish ethnographers and folklorists have tended to consider these fiestas as the historical/psychological basis of the modern bullfight (Ortiz-Canavate 1931; Alvarez de Miranda 1962:31-58; Gomez Tabanera 1968:167, 293-295; Herrera Casado 1973; Maldonado 1975:54-56; Caro Baroja 1984:17-19). The great antitaurine prophet, Eugenio Noel, saw them as the barbarous reservoir of all the distorted ideas of masculinity that find their quintessential expression in the bullfight (1967[1914]:119-125). Arauz de Robles caps his view of bull- fighting as a "virility contest" by reference to certain primitive festivals that featured the jubilant excision of the bull's sex organs (1978:184). A different picture emerges when these encierros (bull runnings) are studied more closely. Though a certain amount of courage is required to run alongside a group of bulls or to approach a toro defuego at night (a bull with two burning torches attached to his horns by a metal apparatus), courage is never consid- ered sufficient in itself. Even those who oppose such events on grounds of cruelty recognize that the chief values involved from the natives' point of view are courage and dexterity (Martinez 1986:14). In a study of the toro de fuego festival in Valencia, Mira found that "macho" qualities like raw courage and willingness to take risks took a definite back seat to another quality, coneixe- ment (roughly, know-how), which stipulates that the risks taken must be cal- culated ones and resolved with skill and agility (Mira 1976:122). "When some- one does not show coneixement, his possible bravery is simply considered a form of useless risk and only provokes criticism and angry protests" (Mira 1976:122). Ingenuity, not manliness, is the foundation of the folk aesthetics that presides over this archaic folk ritual. Pamplona's sanfermines provide an even more striking example: the development of a body of techniques for par- ticipating in the traditional encierros has reached such a degree of sophistication that there are now several informal "schools" or styles that compete with each other in strategic maneuvers and artistic ambitions in what only appears to be several minutes of chaos (Echeverria 1983). More dangerous than the bulls, it turns out, are the many tourists who do not share close group knowledge and 405</page><page sequence="13">TIMOTHYJ. MITCHELL aesthetic criteria, take the encierro to be a simple question of guts, and simul- taneously risk trampling and obstruct native artists by "running their own fear" (Echeverria 1983:138-139). Echeverria concludes that the current "state of the art" of bull-running is analogous to the formative stage of modern bull- fighting, wherein a number of individuals began to invent the diverse suertes that would one day become standard procedure (1983:123-124). And the point is an important one because, as I discussed earlier, the history of the urban bullfight is the history of the slow but steady rationalization of the various ways that the peoples of Spain have played with bulls. The artistic elaboration of the burla, wherein a human eludes a beast's blind charge through ingenuity and grace, was and is clearly present, perhaps dominant, in the taurine rituals of the Spanish folk. And it is this element, not the necessary but insufficient one of valor, that has governed the development of tauromachy to this very day. If bullfighting really were Arauz de Robles's "virility contest," the bull- fighter would not stand a chance. But tauromachy, as defined by numerous matadors and aficionados, is nothing more nor less than a standardized set of norms and procedures which, if executed properly and with a certain degree of nerve, will lead to the swift demise of the bovid with something approach- ing mathematical certainty. Note that I say nerve, not valor or courage or bravery. These terms are best reserved for a lofty quality of the human spirit, the will to confront some spontaneous or unpredictable danger to achieve some social good. Nerve can be defined, at least in the case of bullfighting, as the quality required for carrying out a series of prearranged acts which have been developed to reduce personal risk to a minimum! No spectator who un- derstands the nature of the craft will blame a matador for being unnerved by certain bulls-the unpredictable ones which throw their heads around or turn sharply or "learn" too quickly during the course of the fight. By the same token, a bullfighter is expected to perform with a double measure of artistry with an easy, cooperative bull. The ideal bullfighter, according to the foremost taurine critic of the 20th century, is simply the one who can deal successfully with the most varied kinds of bulls (Corrochano 1961:40). In practice, some bullfighters do much better with bulls that permit a max- imum demonstration ofarte. Others prefer to pit their technical dominion and ingenuity against problematic bulls. Spanish Gypsy bullfighters can be con- sidered an extreme development of the first group; the second has been the historical breeding ground for certain bullfighters who have chosen to em- phasize (and exaggerate) the dangers of their profession and their own superior "valor." In such bullfighters, and more probably in their fans, it might be pos- sible to find some evidence of that deeply rooted faith in manhood that Tierno found in "the Spaniard." Consider the case ofIgnacio Sanchez Mejias, Lorca's much lamented matador of the 1930s. Cossio situated him among the bull- fighters who had "achieved fame for their valor above any other consideration or cause" (1961:975). Even a critic as obsessed with getting his money's worth of courage as was Hemingway found him unpalatable: "He laid his bravery on as with a trowel. It was as though he were constantly showing you the 406</page><page sequence="14">RITUAL ORIGIN OF SCHOLARLY MYTHS quantity of hair on his chest or the way in which he was built in his more private parts" (1932:94). The historian Bennassar ranks Sanchez Mejias first in his gallery of prototypical Spaniards, talented men who dedicated their lives "to the service of an irrational impulse" (1985[1975]:17-18). His death in the bullring at age 43 and Lorca's lyrical gifts made Sanchez Mejias one of the best known matadors outside of Spain and something of a demigod in his own country. But two points need to be borne in mind. First, Sanchez Mejias was not a kamikaze. It was paradoxically his mastery of technical resources and ingenious tricks that enabled him to make such a convincing show of his "care- less" courage (Bergamin 1981:71). Second, no matter how many bullfighters choose to ham up their virile valor or how many spectators come to worship them, the fact remains that the craft itself has been shaped cerebrally, by the precedence of intelligence over strength, strategy over raw courage, brains over brawn. Jerry Lee Lewis can play the piano in a macho style but that does not convert the piano into an instrument of machismo. Virile valor, like Gypsy duende, is only an interpretive mode. As a technology bullfighting is sexless; as a form of art, both sexes have something to contribute. The many dozens of women who have become bullfighters have conclusively demon- strated this point (Boado and Cebolla 1976). Each bullfighter interprets the craft in accordance with his or her degree of expertise, reflexes, physical ability or defects, imagination, ingenuity, and in accordance with the particular cultural values (they are legion) which his or her personality has selected. Likewise, each spectator of the bullfight interprets the spectacle according to his or her competence in matters taurine, social class, values, personality, mood, etc. "The public" varies enormously accord- ing to province, time of year, condition of the bulls, weather, presence or ab- sence of food and alcohol, number of tourists, and other even more intangible factors (Claramunt 1982:118-125). And the public or publics change over time as well, with one generation more demanding or indulgent than its parents, more or less circumspect, more or less knowledgeable (Diaz-Canabate 1970:105-108). Bullfighting and Cultural Complexity The bullfight-event constitutes a perfect model of the four main varieties of cultural complexity enunciated by Saunders (1981:437) in that people can plug into-or reject-it at one of several ideational levels, as a function of their so- cial status, in terms of consciously held attitudes regarding "traditional" and "modern," and as a function of unconscious ambivalence stemming from their personal lives. If we add one more factor to the list, their relative familiarity with the close group criteria of the taurine performers, then we have all the ingredients for the broadest variety of possible reactions. Just as taurine vo- cabulary lends itself to many cultural spheres, only one of which is sexuality, the bullfight-event is complex enough to generate an almost unlimited num- ber of cultural and psychological resonances. A brief review of such psycho- 407</page><page sequence="15">TIMOTHYJ. MITCHELL cultural elaborations will demonstrate the extent to which social scientists with sexual axes to grind have distorted the data. To begin with, a great deal of ideational culture has grown out of an aspect I mentioned earlier, the radical temporality of this idiosyncratic folk craft. Perez de Ayala argued that bullfighting was "the only strictly temporal art," inasmuch as its unfolding is the act of creation itself, not just the effect or il- lusion of such creation which obtains with music or ballet (Perez de Ayala 1963:1276). The impermanence of a matador's performance paradoxically po- tentiates its durability, in the form of mythicizing remembrances that convert the bullring into the privileged domain of laudator temporis acti (1963:793-798). These "praisers of times past" tend to locate the finest and most artistic mo- ments of bullfighting in its so-called Golden Age (1914-20), whose brevity was entirely in keeping with the ephemeral nature of the taurine performance itself. The heroic/aesthetic exploits ofJoselito and Belmonte, the two great rivals of the period, form the "enemy-twins" nucleus of 20th-century taurine mythology. Similar rivalries have provoked similar mythologies in every "age" of bullfighting (Vila 1947; Corrochano 1961:45-51). At times taurine culture's built-in penchant for nostalgia evokes the bitterest sort of disillusion- ment in aficionados-especially those, says Savater, whose deficient knowl- edge of metaphysics keeps them from seeing that the perfect bullfight they dream about never existed and cannot exist (1983:119-124). At other times it provides grounds for a quasi-religious reverence for the giants of the past; taurine writers offer ecstatic descriptions of the immortalfaenas that took place long before they were born (for example, Rios Mozo 1985:33, 38, 46, 59 et passim). Though Bergamin, unquestionably the most prestigious philosopher of the "planet of the bulls," has contributed to this mythic nostalgia, he never- theless underlines the aesthetic miracle of tauromachy which is available at any time to the right sensibilities (1981:39-41, 1985:25-34 et passim). One of Ber- gamin's firmest tenets held that bullfighters who melodramatically flaunt their virile valor effectively falsify the artistic truth of bullfighting, turning it into a kind of sadomasochistic pornography for the ignorant multitudes (1930:41- 45, 1981:50-58, 1985:106-107). That this attitude enjoyed wide currency among taurine insiders was evidenced by their almost total rejection of the last great idol of said multitudes, El Cordobes, whose suicidal antics in the ring made him a "legend in his own time" and simultaneously provoked an out- pouring of nostalgic countermythology on the part of disgusted aficionados (Collins and Lapierre 1968; Pozo and Bard6n 1980; Diaz-Caiiabate 1970:134- 145). It can be stated in general that "the public" is the villain of the piece for most aficionados and serious critics. The public-or so goes the exoteric lore- wants only for thrills (the cheaper the better), is easily fooled, is given to base proclivities, and has a way of capriciously exalting certain matadors only for the pleasure of destroying them afterwards (Bergamin 1981:42-26; Rios Mozo 1985:50-53; Claramunt 1982:148-150). Worst of all, it is alleged, the public no longer pays heed to the inner core of aficionados that have traditionally 408</page><page sequence="16">RITUAL ORIGIN OF SCHOLARLY MYTHS watched over the purity of the bullfighter's art. This informal but formerly powerful "senate," which has an exact parallel in the so-called cabales of fla- menco, has at times been too swift to judge and condemn heterodoxy (Gon- zalez Climent 1964:48-49, 419-429). Ironically, innovators who have taken steps along the road to rationalization-which is the essential historical thrust of bullfighting itself-have been routinely damned at first as the corruptors of the "eternal essence" of tauromachy. It is my contention that said rationali- zation is the basis of the 20th-century discovery of tauromachy's artistic ap- peal. With this brief survey of aesthetic elaborations we have only begun to de- scribe the ideational possibilities of taurine culture. During the 19th-century "Heroic Age," bullfighting was seen not so much as a fine art as a martial art. Bullfighters were identified as warriors or gladiators and their performance as so many episodes of a grandiose popular saga (Bleu 1983[1913]; Altabella 1965:7-47). A related psychocultural development has portrayed the matador as the archetypal Spanish stoic or as the reincarnation of a Classical heroic ethos (Fernandez Suarez 1961:302-303; Perez de Ayala 1963:1271-1276). The bulls themselves have undergone an intense anthropomorphism in Spanish culture: on the one hand, certain bulls have become "legends in their own time" on the basis of size, strength, number of horses killed, strange or amusing behav- iors, number of innocent bystanders killed, etc. (Cossio 1943:323-406). On the other, those bulls that were able to get the best of an unfortunate matador have been branded assassins, cowards, and traitors in the popular ballads that recount the tragic goring (Gil 1964:62, 72, 89, 92, 94 etpassim). Praised for his heroic deeds or vilified for his homicidal tendencies, the bull has generally been considered anything but a victim. The "outsider myths" of the 19th century were essentially literary and ro- mantic, not anthropological or psychoanalytic, and they established a group of archetypes that have dominated bullfighting's image in novels, paintings, music, and films to this day (Lasker 1976; Delgado-Iribarren Negrao 1982; Fernaindez Cuenca 1982; Gonzalez Garcia 1983; Gonzalez Troyano 1983). The tragic death of the matador has been de rigueur in these middle-brow and high- brow spheres of cultural resonance, despite the fact that, statistically, the pic- ador and the banderillero are more likely to be killed in the line of duty (Carande 1964). It is here that taurine culture effortlessly bridges the social or ideational gaps between landless day laborers and belletrists, between oral poetry and cinema, between men and women, between insiders and outsiders. For few events are as productive in psychocultural responses of all kinds as the death of a prestigious bullfighter. That of Manuel Rodriguez "Manolete," for ex- ample, was unquestionably a major sociocultural event of the post-Civil War period and the reverberations continue to this day (Vizcaino Casas 1971:57- 58; Arauz de Robles 1978:11-12; Soto Viniolo 1986:7-66). Few areas of life and culture in Spain fail to intersect in some way with the bullfight-event. Its structural connections with Spanish folk religion, for in- stance, are more striking and a good deal more solid than Pitt-Rivers's mys- 409</page><page sequence="17">TIMOTHYJ. MITCHELL tagogic misrendering of bullfighting itself as religious ritual complete with sexually ambiguous priests and victims. The bullfighting calendar is basically identical to the calendar of summertime patronal festivals. The prestige of a town is symbolically expressed by the caliber of the bullfighters it can contract to honor its supernatural protector. "Cults" of matadors-usually local boys who have made good-are almost as ubiquitous as local cults of saints and answer to the same logic of community differentiation. Like the numerous fiestas of"Moors and Christians" or the Fallas in Levante, bullfights represent urban festival/spectacles that serve old "sociocentric" needs in new circum- stances (Mitchell 1986). Spain's hundreds ofpenas or taurine clubs provide sup- pers and socialization for their members in much the same way as the religious cofradias (Zumel 1982). The rivalries of the bullring have always been oversha- dowed by the rivalries among supporters of different matadors, apologists for different styles, promoters of neighboring towns; in exactly the same way as the conflicting story traditions between the clans of primitive societies (Fischer 1963:260), people in Spain use their particular versions of taurine myths and legends as badges of identity. Taurine culture as a vehicle of sociocentrism functions on many levels: Cordoba, for example, prides itself on the dispro- portionate number of great matadors born in that city or nearby (Sainchez Gar- rido 1985); the cities of Ronda and Seville each dispute the other's claim to be the fons et origo of modern bullfighting (Garcia-Baquero et al. 1980:93-94)- which Cossio attributes to the region of the Pyrenees (1961:850-854). At a more inclusive level, the bullfight has been utilized by the defenders and de- finers of Andalusia's cultural singularity, some of whom claim that it owes its existence to what might be termed a flamenco Volksgeist (Gonzalez Climent 1964:449-461). Meanwhile, Madrid's aficionados pride themselves on being the definitive connoisseurs of taurine art and the supreme arbiters of Andalu- sian pretensions (Bleu 1983:12; Arevalo and Moral 1985:100-101). Finally, at a nationalistic level, the institution of tauromachy has been one of the most powerful generators of cultural specificity Spain has known, the very essence of the Spanish raza (race), casta (caste), or sangre (blood)-all the naturalistic metaphors that Handler and Linnekin find at work in processes of"tradition- alization" (1984:277-278). And, fully in keeping with Saunders's third cate- gory of cultural complexity, bullfighting has lent itself to the opposite process: the most famous group of"modernizers" in Spanish history, the Generation of 1898, was determined to extirpate the bullfight, and precisely because they identified it with the traditional essence of their country! (Prado 1973:11-61; Cambria 1974:48-100). Conclusion The abuse of linguistic and folkloristic data, the confusion of metaphor with essence and fantasy with explanation, the willful disregard for the explanations of insiders, vulgar Freudianism, reductionism-these logical and methodolog- ical errors have characterized outsiders' interpretations of bullfighting. But the 410</page><page sequence="18">RITUAL ORIGIN OF SCHOLARLY MYTHS principal defect to be deplored is their one-sidedness. Unilateral interpreta- tions of a cultural phenomenon that is as multilateral, dense, and contradictory as the bullfight cannot help but miss the mark. Rather than developing a tol- erance for this ambiguity, taurine exegetes have tended to reduce it to some simple monolithic sign that can be equated to some other. They illicitly gen- eralize a belief or a fantasy that may only belong to a few members of a social class or to a single level of culture as perceived by a few masculine informants in a given province. The resultant distortions of reality deserve to be branded "scholarly myths" and unhesitatingly grouped with other outsider myths of a romantic or archaeological hue. I do not believe that it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a foreigner to understand bullfighting, as one elderly aficionado told me. But research will only advance when (1) the body of techniques that con- stitutes the entirely unambiguous essence of tauromachy is distinguished from the highly ambiguous psychological and cultural resonances of the bullfight- event, and (2) when these psychocultural resonances are sorted out according to the specific groups, classes, levels of culture, etc. that may harbor them at one moment or another. Folkloristic, sociological, and anthropological inves- tigations can then proceed productively in many possible directions. Caro Ba- roja has already indicated four concrete ways in which our information about rural encierros and their connection to civil and religious institutions need to be improved (1984:18-19). Arevalo has outlined ten major enigmas relating to the history, politics, sociology, and biotechnology of bullfighting that have yet to be resolved (1984:56-59). Psychologically minded folklorists may wish to look more closely into the intricate web of rituals and superstitions that many bullfighters rely upon to one degree or another or the mimetico-char- ismatic chemistry between matadors and their penas. Little attention has been paid thus far to the structural connections between comic bullfighting and the serious kind, with reference to the different groups who enjoy or condemn either one. A systematic exploration of the matador as a hero of modern mass culture in Spain and Latin America has yet to be undertaken. The manner in which the folk aesthetics and forms of arte flamenco have influenced those of bullfighting is another promising area for research, provided it is henceforth carried out on a less mystical plane. And it would be extremely useful to know more about the ways in which women of diverse backgrounds and personal- ities have joined in or opted out of taurine culture over the years. We do not need another "interpretation" of bullfighting. We have dozens, each more strained than the last. Nor is it a question of affording a vague, open-minded tolerance to the ones that exist. It is a question of seeing the lim- its of all interpretations, their arbitrariness, their perverse blind spots. It is, finally, a question of recognizing that several hundred years and several thou- sand books have left questions of vital import untouched. As Bergamin put it in one of his final taurine essays (1985:114), "Will we ever be able to learn all that bullfighting teaches us?" 411</page><page sequence="19">TIMOTHYJ. MITCHELL Notes 'This paragraph is a condensed, folkloristic summary of the lore and precepts contained in the taurine treatises or tauromaquias so hastily dismissed by Alvarez de Miranda (1962:117) as well as some modern ex- planations that noted bullfighters have made of their art. See Delgado 1985[1796]; Cossio 1947:1-82; Chaves Nogales 1969[1935]; Armifian 1953; Ortega 1950. 2And they have been as ignored by anthropologists as the bullfighters themselves. No folk craft has stim- ulated a critical literature of the rigor and quality of taurine theory and analysis. For the major critics of the 19th century, see Altabella 1965 and F. de Cossio 1986. For the 20th century, see Lujan 1982. 3Martinez Remis 1963:111, 70, 176, respectively; see also 66, 72, 165, 168, 171, 174-175. The frequent assimilation of the image of wily temptress with that of the bullfighter and the fact that women protagonize numerous rural encierros have recently led Delgado Ruiz (1986:108-125) to conclusions diametrically opposed to those of Douglass-though he does not abandon the basic fallacy that the bullfight is a sexual discourse. See also Alvarez 1964 and Arauz de Robles 1978:41-51. 4Douglass's attempt to construe an enormously complex cultural variable as a simple binomial can have ludicrous results: "In the 15th century the purity of women was expanded into a national concern for racial purity" (1984:248).
