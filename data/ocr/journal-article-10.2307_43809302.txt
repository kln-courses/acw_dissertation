<plain_text><page sequence="1">101 AND COUNTING: DALMATIANS IN FILM AND ADVERTISING Erica Sheen Abstract In both academic and animal welfare circles, Disney's live action films 101 and 102 Dalmatians have been criticised as a commercial exploitation of the breed. From this perspective, it was widely held that the Dalmatian has been subject to over-breeding and abandonment as a direct result of these films, and that Disney should be held responsible for this abuse. I question these assumptions. I discuss the Hollywood animad image as a form of intellectual property and provide a detailed account of negotiations between Disney and Dalmatian breed associations in America and the UK. In response to critics who described the films as "an advertisement for the breed", I suggest that Disney's animal imagery should be seen as a more complex cultural and economic negotiation between filmmaker and audience, and conclude that our understanding of the commercial deployment of the Dalmatian image must be situated in a more nuanced account of the relationship between advertising and film. Keywords : Dalmatian, dog, Disney, film, advertising Introduction Until recently, studies of the animal image have approached it as a form of exploitation. When we turn an animal into a sign relation, we enhance its potential for abuse: we cherish the toy, but neglect the dog. However, in his study of animals in film, Jonathan Burt has proposed an approach that emphasises "positive directions". (Burt 2002: 197) Burt combines the exposure of industrial exploitation with generous readings of cinematic representations of animal agency and its transformative effect on human lives. However, as he himself acknowledges, one result of this balanced approach is that it is: difficult to assess what particular kinds of animal imagery feed the different attitudes and actions we take towards the animal world . . . [W]hen audiences do respond to the plight of animals as a result of a film this response can be highly selective and unpredictable. (Burt 2002: 188) As he records, "there are also films that have led to a surge in sales of featured animals": © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2005 Worldviews 9,2 236-254 Also available online - www.brill.nl</page><page sequence="2">IOI AND COUNTING 237 In an interesting development of this, a filmmaker recently provided the public with guidelines as to whether or not to buy an animal after seeing a film. Included in the titles at the end of 102 Dalmatians is the caveat that "the producers, the Walt Disney Company, the American Humane Association and the Dalmatian Club of America want every pet to have a loving and permanent home. If you are adopting a pet be sure you are ready for a lifetime commitment and research your choice carefully". The advice is sensible but coming after two films - 101 Dalmatians (1996) and 102 Dalmatians (2000) - that have effectively acted as advertisements for this visually striking breed of dogs, it seems an inadequate gesture. (Burt 2002: 189) The aim of this discussion is to expand Burt's account of the rela- tion between welfare and exploitation in the Disney Dalmatians film, and in doing so to suggest that the difficulties he identifies derive in part from his own frames of reference. His critique of the modernist and postmodernist reduction of the animal to "pure sign" (Burt 2002: 29) is spot on, but his own approach reproduces some of the same problems. This is because, whilst his account ranges widely across contrasting traditions and practices of filmmaking, he makes no dis- tinctions between the modes of production that sustain them, and as a result is frequendy guilty of allowing highly emotive images to substitute for analysis.1 In his chapter on "Vision and Ethics", for example, he reproduces images of dead horses in productions includ- ing Eisenstein's October and Fred Niblo's early Ben-Hur.2 But he does not discuss the implications of the industrial and institutional différences between the Soviet film industry and the Hollywood studio system in the 1920s. In fact, he doesn't discuss Eisenstein's film at all. One result of this is that he does not identify the frame of refer- ence that determines the conditions of an animal's participation in the making of a film - that is, its status as property. Clearly, such an approach will require an account of the mechanisms of appro- priation by which a particular mode of production asserts its inter- ests in that property. In the context of the Hollywood studio system, of which Disney is an exemplary instance, the two most important are advertising and the laws of intellectual property. From this per- spective, Burt's suggestion that 101 and 102 Dalmatians had "effectively acted as advertising" is particularly problematic. As we shall see, the complementarity between filmmaking and advertising in Hollywood cinema requires a far more nuanced analysis.</page><page sequence="3">238 ERICA SHEEN Disney and the Breed Image In order to develop such an analysis, we have to introduce another category surprisingly absent from Burt's study: the category of breed. Burt describes the Dalmatian as "a visually striking breed". This is of course true, though arguably more because it is a breed than because it is visually striking. Like any breed, the Dalmatian's appear- ance is systematically produced and reproduced by the activity of breeding. As such, it has both a distinctive equivalence to, and appli- cation within, the Hollywood studio system; that is to say, a generically- based system of production, distribution and exhibition that predicates its economic future on the long-term reproducibility of its most profitable images. Other Hollywood dog images are visually striking for the same reason: the Labrador retriever, the German Shepherd, the Rottweiler have all been endowed with generically coded person- alities that move easily from film to film. Hollywood has shown itself extremely receptive to breed-based conceptions of image, both in the human and in the animal; Disney in particular has been instrumental in creating a link between the animal image and a social and physical ideal of Americanness. However, one of the paradoxes of this approach to production is that whilst the breed image sustains a strand of generic production with remarkable efficiency, particularly in comparison with the human star (many dogs have been used to play Lassie, thereby sustaining the "Lassie" character past the lifetime or career of a single animal in a way not usually possible for human characters),3 its status as property is problematic. There is no intellectual property in the breed image as such, precisely because the way it works as an image is to reproduce itself without significant differentiation. There is only prop- erty in an image if it has been produced by innovative creative labour, and is thus recognizable as unique and original. There is property in Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck because they are rec- ognizable as Mickey and Donald, not as generic mice and ducks. Indeed, Mickey is the prime example of how profitable this creative innovation can be: profitable enough to seek to change the American constitution in a series of copyright term amendments designed to retain corporate ownership of the image and prevent it from enter- ing the public domain. But whilst Disney has property in animator Bill Peet's original designs for the animated feature One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961),4 or in specific photographic images from the</page><page sequence="4">IOI AND COUNTING 239 live action remakes, it has no property in the generic Dalmatian image and is consequently unable to prevent people using drawings or photographs of Dalmatians, even in merchandising operations that are clearly derivative of their films. Such situations were pervasive in the 1990s, when the re-release of the animated feature and pro- duction of the two new live action films 101 and 102 Dalmatians cre- ated a market eager to exploit the Dalmatian breed image to the full. Publisher William Heinemann's re-marketing of Dodie Smith's original story, The Hundred and One Dalmatians or the Great Dog Robbery , (Smith 1956) provides one of the most interesting examples of this. Heinemann had held the text copyright since 1956, the date of first publication. In 1993, Heinemann released a "new gift edition", now titled The Hundred and One Dalmatians ,5 with illustrations by Vanessa Julian-Ottie (Smith 1993).6 The publisher's blurb refers to Disney's animated film, describing it as "a perennial favourite in the cinema, constantly reissued to the delight of generations of children and their parents". This is illuminating: to describe the film as " constantly reis- sued" naturalises both the mechanisms by which a range of com- peting property rights are asserted, and Heinemann's own exploitation of them. Of course, these mechanisms were already being exploited to the full by Disney itself. In 1991, Disney launched the Disney Press with Walt Disney's 101 Dalmatians: A Counting Book , and in the same year gave the animated feature a theatrical re-release. The video followed in 1992. The company thus created as many oppor- tunities as possible to profit from its existing rights in the work before embarking on the production and release of the live action remake in 1994-5. The limited value to Disney of the generic Dalmatian image is the main reason why we should be sceptical of readings of the film that describe it, as Jonathan Burt does, as an advertisement for the breed. It is true that the use of real Dalmatians in the live action films raises some of the same questions as product placement, an increasingly visible aspect of film production in the "synergistic" econ- omy of New Hollywood of the 1980s and 90s.7 But it is not par- ticularly useful to limit our understanding of this complex dynamic to the question of "whether or not to buy an animal". From its ear- liest stages of development, 101 Dalmatians provides an excellent demonstration of this. To explain, I must provide a biographical out- line of its author.8</page><page sequence="5">240 ERICA SHEEN 101 Dalmatians : From Page to Screen In the late 1920s and early 30s, Dodie Smith trained as an actress, worked her way through a position as toy buyer at Heals (there are photos of her with soft toy animals) to a successful career as a writer of English drawing room plays, the best known of which is prob- ably Dear Octopus (1938). She became a Dalmatian owner when her husband, Alec Beesley, bought her a puppy because he thought it the perfect accessory for her visually striking personal style (one of the many ways in which this flamboyant, assertive woman and her submissive husband were far more like the De Vils than the Dearlys). When the war started, the couple moved to the US, where Smith worked as a scriptwriter for Paramount, working on productions including The Uninvited (Allen 1944) and Darling How Could Tou (Leisen 1951). When the war ended, the audience for her distinctively pre- war English plays had gone. Casting about for another genre, she decided on a children's story about Dalmatians, and in 1956 pub- lished 101 Dalmatians. Within three years she negotiated a very good deal with Disney, and Disney's seventeenth full-length animated fea- ture was released in 1961. At this point it would be tempting to suc- cumb to a "literary" idea of authorship, and suggest that this is an endearingly eccentric English story mercilessly exploited by money- minded Americans, but even this brief synopsis makes it obvious how misguided that would be. From toy buyer to scriptwriter, Smith's professional experience makes it unlikely that she was not herself actively exploiting a market for animal images already operating under the rubric of the Disney cartoon.9 Dumbo and Bambi , the first full-length animated features about animals, were released soon after Smith's arrivati in the US, in 1941 and 1942, and they were fol- lowed after the war in 1955, the year she was writing the book, by the first dog story, Lady and the Tramp . She was also actively exploiting the post-war American market for stories about England and the English. In this respect, Smith's own exploitation of the Dalmatian breed image has a slightly queasy asso- ciation with Hollywood's use of animals as cultural stereotypes. It is made even queasier by its configuration within the English class system. Smith's story presents not one but two breeding pairs of dogs: Pongo and Missis, owned by Mr and Mrs Dearly, who repro- duce within the legitimate social framework provided by the Dearlys'</page><page sequence="6">IOI AND COUNTING 241 marriage; and Perdita, a stray who has whelped after an accidental mating, and whom the Dearlys acquire as a wet nurse when Missis is unable to provide sufficient milk for her fifteen puppies. It is the Dearlys who give Perdita her upmarket literary name, though in doing so they also vest her with its Shakespearean subtext of sexual promiscuity and class hybridisation. Perdita is a liver bitch, not the more "classic" black and white, liver pigmentation being a some- what unpredictable genetic permutation in Dalmatian breeding: "Perdita had been the only one in her family and always thought herself a freak" (Smith 1993: 29). Her freakish nature expresses itself when she succumbs to the call of the oestrus, runs off into the coun- tryside, encounters another dog (also a liver Dalmatian, happily), and is immediately impregnated. Despite Smith's coy use of the free indi- rect style (the dogs "made swift arrangements for their marriage" [Smith 1993: 29]), Perdita is clearly "lost" in every sense: a fallen woman, an unmarried single mother - absolute anathema in the mid 1950s. When she gives birth, her puppies are sold (to Cruella, as it later turns out) and in her search for them she becomes literally lost and then subsequendy found by Mrs Dearly, who sees her immedi- ately as surrogate mother rather than an animal in need of care. She is assimilated into the Dearlys' household, serves as a kind of canine maidservant when Pongo and Missis go in search of their own puppies, and is reunited by their efforts with her own family and even finally with her "husband", Prince. Prince is the "hundred- and-oneth" Dalmatian (Smith 1993: 186). He is notable for his absence throughout the narrative, as indeed from all subsequent adaptations, which, in rationalising him out of the story, also sacrifice his poten- tially explanatory relation to the statistic that constitutes its title. (I shall explain this suggestion in due course.) Soon after Perdita's intro- duction into the household, there is one particularly unpleasant moment when Pongo watches her suckling his puppies and "felt proud and protective - and extremely sorry for Perdita. Really she was a very pretty girl - if not a patch on his Missis". (Smith 1993: 31-2). It should come as no surprise that Bill Peet reworked this story of sexual misadventure into a more comforting 1950s image of Mummy, Daddy and a bouncing baby-boom family. I can only glance at the possible link between Smith's story and the post-war survived of an all-but-discredited European discourse of eugenics. But it is worth pointing out that 101 Dalmatians is not the only evidence</page><page sequence="7">242 ERICA SHEEN that Disney's animal stories decontaminate a distinctively Germanic tradition of Tierromane ("animal novel") by assimilating it into the healthy productivity of post-war American domesticity.10 Besides this reorganisation of the story's structure of parenthood, Peet's most obvious change is the film's visual emphasis on the pup- pies as a breed image characterised by playful hyperactivity. This is true to the breed: Dalmatians are playful and hyperactive. But it is also reflects the preoccupation with youth culture characteristic of film and advertising in the 1950s. Indeed, the link between youth culture and breed image emerges as precisely the range of conno- tations associated with the Dalmatian in the American media prior to the publication of Smith's story and its production by Disney. In the 1940s and 50s, the Dalmatian had a high profile in advertising, but one campaign stands out. In 1947, Texaco launched a long-run- ning campaign for its "Firechief" gasoline. The campaign was directed at both a national and a domestic market. Both these nuances came together in what is still the central stereotype of national and domes- tic security: the fireman. In an American context, there is a tradi- tional association between the (usually full grown) Dalmatian and the fire station. The brilliance of Texaco's campaign resides in its perception of the potential of the puppy image to work as a relay for a highly contemporary mix of post-war ideas about hearth and home. Starting from a drawing of a single puppy running alongside the footplate of a fire engine with a fire helmet in its mouth, the campaign evolved into a series of full-page cartoon images of five puppies at play: running away from a scarecrow; chewing up a cro- quet set; getting tangled up in a lawn sprinkler; being chased by a Thanksgiving turkey; playing with Christmas decorations; and, more improbably, surfing-boarding - an image that makes clear that the world of the fire station has merged with that of the cartoon, with its characteristically anthropomorphic repertoire of animal agencies. Paradoxically, the release of the breed image from the visual confines of the fire station enhances its connotative capacity to promote the "Firechief" brand. The slogan links the puppies' hyperactivity with the power of the gasoline: "plenty lively"; "action packed"; "raring to go"; "nothing frisker". In its development of what is implicitly a continuing narrative - it ran for over nine years - it draws on and feeds into the imaginative domain of the Disney animated feature. It may be difficult to argue that Dodie Smith had seen this cam- paign (though, given its coverage, it would be surprising if she had</page><page sequence="8">IOI AND COUNTING 243 not), but a professional animator like Bill Peet could hardly have missed it. It goes without saying that Texaco was not trying to sell Dalmatians. But Texaco knew it was creating a demand for some- thing other than petrol. In an image of the puppies playing around a traditional parlour chair, published in 1950, readers were asked, "Like these pups? We'll be happy to send you a reproduction in full color, suitable for framing" (figure 1). The Dalmatian image may give metaphorical identity to the prod- uct, but it also quite literally furnishes the world of the public it thereby helps to reconfigure as market or audience. What we are presented with here is not as much an image as a two-way act of visualisation. In the 1950s, advertisers and filmmakers used images to "see" their customers as much as those customers used images to see films and adverts. Indeed, in the economic conditions that fol- lowed the breakdown of verticali integration, Hollywood filmmakers were increasingly forced to draw on the skills and techniques of advertising in order to target their audiences and draw them into the world of cinema.11 Disney and the Breeders: Exploitation v . Welfare The media profile of the Dalmatian in the years leading up to the production of the first Disney film was unequalled until the time of the live action remakes in the 1990s. From 1996 to 2000, the live Dalmatian image was used to sell almost everything: dog food; shoes; cars; analgesics; soya milk; cake; chocolate; dental insurance; pet insurance; telephone and television companies; video cameras and recorders; mobile phones; vacuum cleaners; bathroom cleaners; deter- gents; facial cleanser; support hosiery; incontinence pads; MacDonalds; Pepsi; Budweiser.12 The thing that's immediately noticeable about this list is its inclusivity. I suggested that the Texaco campaign of the 1950s enhanced the connotative capacity of the Dalmatian breed image. In the 1990s, that capacity was almost unlimited. But whilst the Dalmatian's media profile in the '50s demonstrably preceded both novel and film, an analysis of the Dalmatian in advertising from the mid '80s onwards suggests that, second time round, this enhance- ment came after the films, not before.13 If that is the case, it raises certain questions, questions that are at the heart of the difficulties in assessing those "selective and unpredictable" responses to the</page><page sequence="9">244 ERICA SHEEN Fig. 1. "Like these pups ?" Texaco advertising image (1950).</page><page sequence="10">IOI AND COUNTING 245 animal image identified by Jonathan Burt. Is Disney responsible for the commercialisation of the Dalmatian breed image in the after- math of the live action films? Was the breed subject to abuse as a result of this commercialisation? If so, should Disney be held account- able for its effects? To try to answer this, let us take two contrasting positions of inter- est within the debate: an animad welfare worker, and an advertising executive. John Terry is Welfare Co-ordinator for the North of England Dalmatian Club (hereafter the NoEDC). In this role, he identifies and collects dogs in need of rescue, co-ordinates efforts to re-home them, and works to discourage irresponsible breeding and ownership. In an interview with me, he made it clear that he would unhesitatingly answer all three questions in the affirmative. Paul Edwards is Director of Creative Strategy at Publicis.14 I approached him for an advertising "creative's" view on why advertisers would use a Dalmatian image in their work. He suggested that its primary appeal would be the fact that it's a beautiful animal, with classic design features and elegant physique. When asked how he would explain the increased popularity of the image in the period follow- ing the films, he rejected the idea that advertisers would simply be copying Disney, and pointed out that people who make adverts are filmmakers too, and as such similarly engaged in acts of creative innovation. How do we reconcile these seemingly opposing views? Certainly, a high proportion of the adverts featuring Dalmatians between 1996 and 2001 supports Paul Edwards' views. For instance, a Persil cam- paign of 1996 demonstrated the detergent's "stain release" proper- ties by showing a Dalmatian shaking its spots off. Similarly, a Renault campaign of 2001 showed a stylish woman dressed in black, driving a Mégane with a Dalmatian in the back seat. She brakes suddenly, and the dog's spots slide forward to the front of its body. It then shakes itself and the spots setde back in place. Again, it would be hard to argue that images like this sell Dalmatians: as with the Texaco campaign, one's response is more likely to be a desire to get a copy, or at least to see them again, than to go out and buy a dog. In fact, they may have been influential on the design of the sequel 102 in its tendency towards a more fantastic, even surreal, visual register: certainly, the image of a puppy shaking its spots off emerges in the marketing of the DVD. Since 102 constituted something of a rapprochement in Disney's approach to welfare issues, the creativity</page><page sequence="11">246 ERICA SHEEN of the relation between advertising and film may once again turn out to be a significant factor in determining our response to the issue as a whole. If this is the case, there would appear to be a significant complementarity between the interests of the animal welfare worker and those of the advertiser or filmmaker, or at least an unresolved tension between complementarity and opposition. It is this unresolved tension that becomes most apparent when we consider the film's production history in detail. In 1995, Birds and Animals Unlimited, the company contracted to supply, train and maintain animals for the film, contacted the Dalmatian Club of America (hereafter the DCA), to tell them that Disney was about to begin a live-action remake of the classic car- toon. According to Julie Lux, the DCA's Public Relations Officer, Disney was "concerned about the health and welfare of puppies used in the movie".15 Rob Lawson, also an officer of the DCA, stressed the mutuality of this concern: "we both had an investment in health and welfare of the breed; no 'blame' was ever an issue".16 Notwith- standing, Peggy Rudder, the then president of the DCA, asked Disney to re-consider their commitment to the film, but of course they did not. They also refused the DCA's very reasonable requests: the inser- tion of a disclaimer urging people to take advice before buying a puppy, a link from the movie website to the DCA website, and the inclusion of information about the breed in press material. Subsequently the DCA also applied to the Disney Foundation for contributions to their welfare funds, and were again refused. Lawson was neither sur- prised nor critical of this refusal. As he explained it to me, Disney makes films and cartoons that feature animals: to make a donation to a single interest group would "open up a Pandora's box." Lawson's interpretation of this position affirms the professionalism of both insti- tutions, but it also identifies the potential areas of conflict between them. As the film went into production in England, the DCA mounted a campaign to raise public awareness about the breed. This resulted in more than two hundred newspaper articles and interviews on national TV in slots such as the Today Show, ABC Early Morning, CBS News, CNN and local TV. Eva Berg, current president of the DCA, makes an extremely acute observation about this campaign. Whilst she points out the rise in welfare cases in the immediate after- math of the film, she also believes that the DCA's "somewhat pre- cautious warnings to future Dalmatian owners" were partly to blame for the breed's negative press: "the Dalmatian shortly thereafter</page><page sequence="12">IOI AND COUNTING 247 became a much maligned breed ... we slipped in popularity from the #9 most popular breed to somewhere in the 80s".17 There are several important things about this, all of which complicate any analy- sis of the relation between exploitation and abuse within this com- plex event. First, Disney initiated contact with the DCA on a welfare basis, but would not agree to their requests. Second, the DCA urged Disney to involve itself in a public campaign on welfare issues, but acknowledge that their own campaign in response to Disney's refusal may have produced some of the bad effects subsequently attributed to the film. As 101 Dalmatians went into production in England, Birds and Animals Unlimited now approached the British Dalmatian Club (hereafter the BDC) with a view to making contact with owners and rescue organisations that might be prepared to allow their dogs to be used in the film. Their proposal was to lease the animals, send trainers in to work with them, and return them to their owners after filming. This is in itself a controversial idea. As a property relation, leasehold has distinct advantages for the lessee, the most obvious being the fact that s/he has neither the capital outlay nor the oblig- ations and penalties of full ownership. It works well with houses and cars, but its application to animals is worrying. Indeed, its viability as the basis of a business contract depends on the very vagueness of an animal's status as property, and of the level of protection to which it would be entitled as a result. Predictably, the proposal pro- duced great anxiety, and the BDC called a special general meeting under the motion "this meeting does not support the making of 101 Dalmatians using live dogs, and instructs the elected Officers and Committee to proceed no further with co-operation with Disney or Disney Representatives." In the debate that followed, the member- ship was starkly divided: those against cooperation believed that Disney would not be able to make the film without their help and would give up if they refused; those who supported it believed that Disney would make the film anyway and that the interests of the breed would be better served if they stayed involved. Eventually the motion was carried, and Birds and Animals Unlimited had to pro- ceed without BDC support. They advertised in British newspapers, bought some dogs, leased several litters. It is universally agreed that they treated all their animals with exemplary care, but obviously this care was exercised within the framework of a mode of ownership that some would consider to be in itself a form of abuse.</page><page sequence="13">248 ERICA SHEEN It is obvious from the accounts of those involved in this episode that it was a painful and divisive experience.18 One immediate out- come was the BDC's formation of its own welfare service. Until then, an independent organisation, Dalmatian Rescue, had been run by one of the club's previous presidents. Now, in 1996, the BDC set up its own rescue: clearly, the experience of dealing with Disney on this issue focused questions of responsibility in a very immediate way. It also led them to refuse Disney's offer of a donation - a strong contrast with the position taken by the DCA. Is the difference between the two breed associations simply the result of the fact that the DCA did not have to deal with the question of the acquisition of animals, and was therefore less compromised by Disney's proposals? Or are British breeders and owners less likely than their American coun- terparts to see commerce as an appropriate support system for the relationship between humans and animals? One way or the other, Disney was obviously surprised by adverse response to the produc- tion, and took a number of measures to counteract it when they planned the sequel. The plot of 102 , based in an animal rescue cen- tre, with an animad rights activist hero, was both a visualisation of, and a response to, this opposition. In its presentation of a "con- verted" Cruella now working on behalf of animal welfare, the film offers a retrospective reading of her exploitation of Dalmatian pup- pies (and their final triumph over her) as an allegory of the pro- duction itself. I suggested earlier that the economic conditions of Hollywood in the 1950s necessitated an active visualisation of its potential audience. 101 and 102 demonstrate clearly that the act of visualisation required by the synergistic economy of New Hollywood is itself synergistic, calling for a "vision" of a market that invests in animal welfare and ethical business practices as much as in gasoline and framed reproductions. Disney renewed contact with the DCA and offered all the things they had refused in 1996: the disclaimer, the website links, and a discussion on the DVD release of 102 of the responsibilities of Dalmatian ownership. By that time, of course - as Jonathan Burt points out - it would have been too late for anyone who needed the warning to have benefited from it. In the last analysis, the key question is whether or not these films caused a rise in the number of abandoned ani- mals. It is hard to arrive at any firm conclusion about this, not least because to do so relies on the interpretation of statistics. I present</page><page sequence="14">IOI AND COUNTING 249 below a grid made up of some of the figures we would need to take into consideration. The Kennel Club figures go back further than the other three sources, but I have included them despite the lack of available com- parison. As already noted, the BDC welfare service dates from 1996; the Battersea Dogs Home current database dates from 1995: Year KC DR BDC BDH 1986 752 1987 773 1988 861 1989 1372 1990 1474 1991 theatrical re-release of original 101 1504 1992 video release of original 101 1898 1993 2235 1994 2794 1995 3120 0.17 1996 theatrical release of live action 101 3910 100 56 0.23 1997 3786 106 80 0.37 1998 3058 75 172 0.41 1999 2679 96 280 0.43 2000 theatrical release of live action 102 2752 103 201 0.47 2001 2062 91 150 0.51 2002 2071 87 168 0.47 2003 2253 25 217 0.45 Key: KC: Kennel Club Dalmatian puppy registrations; DR: dogs handled by Dalmatian Rescue; BDC: dogs handled by BDC welfare service; BDH: Dalmatians handled by Battersea Dogs Home, as a percentage of the overall number of dogs Kennel Club registration figures show that in 1996 there was a rise by over 25% to an all-time high. This could be, and has been, taken to confirm the belief that Dalmatians were over-bred in anticipation of the film. The figures began to fall immediately afterwards, but the pattern repeats in 2000: a rise, though here a smaller one, fol- lowed by a fall, a much bigger one of about 35%. This pattern of rise and fall is distinctive enough to suggest that it aligns in some way with the release of the two films. Or is it? The figures had begun to rise well before then, and the biggest increase, by over 50%, came in 1989. How do we interpret this? Might it not suggest</page><page sequence="15">250 ERICA SHEEN that the significant pattern relating to the release of the films was actually the fall in registration numbers rather than the rise? If so, is it not possible that the significant event recorded by these figures is - in line with Eva Berg's observation - the breeders' negative reac- tion to the films rather than the films themselves? Perhaps a correlation between registration and rescue figures can help us decide. After the inception of the BDC welfare service in 1996, the numbers of rescued dogs rose fivefold across the next four years. And even though Dalmatian Rescue began to scale down its activities after the new service was instituted, their figures remained relatively constant, confirming an inclusive rise across the two ser- vices by 2.5. Since registration figures had already begun to decline, this means that rescue figures were proportionately even higher in relation to a decline in the population's overall rate of growth. Once again, the pattern is distinctive enough to suggest an alignment with the release of the two films ... or is it? Could it be that this align- ment is an effect artificially produced by the isolation of Dalmatian statistics from those of other breeds? I asked the Battersea Dogs Home in London for figures of Dalmatians as a proportion of their overall intake. In 1995, Dalmatians represented 0.17% of the total dogs cared for. In 1996, the figure began to rise, and continued to rise until in 2001, when it reached an all-time high of 0.51%. After that, it began to dip. Clearly, the breed did experience an increase of homing difficulties in relation to the overall dog population dur- ing the period in question. But Battersea pointed out that the same period saw a rise in the general proportion of breed dogs within their overall dog population: from 44.68% in 1998 to 56.73% in 2003. It is thus at least possible that the rise in Dalmatian rescue figures correlates more significandy to a general rise in the breed dog population than to internili fluctuations within the Dalmatian population. If that is the case, we may have to conclude that Disney's films are less a cause of population change than an effect.19 Clearly, the more sets of figures there are, the more we need, and the more difficult it is to interpret them. But what is interesting is not whether they enable us to come to any firm conclusions; it is rather the fact that they seem to be the only way we can try. The status of the statistic as a way of seeing the unseen is built into this story in the overlap between the hundred and one dogs of the tide and the invisible mass of homeless dogs that may or may not have been brought into being by the films. In fact, this homeless mass</page><page sequence="16">IOI AND COUNTING 251 becomes visible only in Disney's films, and not simply because, by definition, films use images rather than words. It becomes visible as a result of precisely those changes to the story we would have to describe as the creative innovation that identifies the films as Disney's property. I suggested earlier that Perdita's missing "husband" has a potentially explanatory relation to the statistic that constitutes the title of the story. What I meant by this is that the absent father stands as a figure for a breeding context in which puppies are pro- duced for exploitation rather than nurture. Smith systematically sup- presses this aspect of her own story. When "Prince" re-appears at the end, a triangular structure of three sets of parents - one human and two animal pairs - reconfigures the homeless mass as an extended aristocratic family (Smith's word is "dynasty" [Smith 1993: 190]). By contrast, Disney's "normalisation" of the structure of parenthood exposes the inadequacy of the family as a system of support for over a hundred puppies, so each successive adaptation must offer its audi- ences an acceptable solution to the problem paradoxically created by the films' own attempts to be responsible. The way they do this underlines my account of filmmaking as a two-way act of visualisa- tion. Both versions of 101 draw on a mode of visualisation that has been embedded within the narrative in the person of "Roger", Disney's version of Mr Dearly. In both, that mode of visualisation results in the creation of an intellectual property in the Dalmatian breed image. In Smith's story, Dearly is a government officer. We are not told what work he does, only that he is "rather unusually rich" (Smith 1993: 2). At the end, it is simply his unlimited buying power that solves the problem, when he buys Cruella's Hell Hall and converts it to a dog paradise. By contrast, Disney's Roger is poor but creative: first a songwriter, then a computer game designer. Both films call on his skills to create a future for the puppies. In the animated feature, the way he does this unleashes the "utopian" potentiell of the film's generic associations with the musical. When Pongo, Perdita and ninety-nine puppies arrive on their doorstep, Roger and Anita instantly decide to keep them all and set up a "Dalmatian Plantation". The film then ends with a song in which the less-than-utopian implications of this idea, particularly for the USA in the 1960s, are just about kept in check by an extraordinary sequence of rhymes that imposes a discourse of population control on the homeless puppies: "Dalmatian . . . plantation . . . population . . . location . . . aggregation".</page><page sequence="17">252 ERICA SHEEN Disney was clearly aware that this image would no longer work for an audience in the 1990s. The live action 101 Dalatians visualises the precise mechanisms by which this control is exercised, and sit- uates them in a benevolent relation to the homeless puppies. The Dalmatians do not make their own way home: they are returned by the police, who warn Roger and Anita that the animals will have to be taken to the pound unless they can offer them a home. Fortunately, Roger designs a successful computer game retelling the story of Cruella De Vil (with graphics that re-package the visual style of the original cartoons: Disney thus asserts a continuity between its properties in the old and new versions of the story, whilst opening synergistic links with the 1990s computer game industry). The cou- ple then buy a house in the country and move there with all the Dalmatians. The final image of an isolated rural retreat completely overrun by animals does not answer the question it poses to the audience. It merely serves to anticipate the statistical form that ques- tion might take. Conclusion Ian Hacking has pointed out that the term les miserables , which Victor Hugo took from Eugene Sue and used as a title for his novel, was also the title of the standard topic for world statistical congresses in the mid-nineteenth century (Hacking 1991: 188). Les miserables are society's unthought; those we cannot see but need to visualise. At the turn of the twenty-first century, Dalmatians became les miserables of the animal world. Disney's interest in facilitating their visualisa- tion unquestionably lay in the identification of potential audiences rather than in animal welfare. Is it because they showed us what they thought we didn't want them to prevent us from seeing that we think they are responsible for producing it? I asked everyone with whom I discussed these issues whether they believed the breed had suffered abuse because of Disney's films. NoEDC and BDC members thought it had. Birds and Animals Unlimited thought it had not. We might allow Simon Underwood, the Field Operations Manager of the Dogs Trust (until recently the National Canine Defence League, or NCDL), to mediate these two positions. Although he could not provide any figures, he said that he believed that the number of Dalmatians in their shelters had not risen in the after-</page><page sequence="18">IOI AND COUNTING 253 math of the films, and that concern about the effect of the film within the breed associations had been an overreaction. But he did acknowledge that the Dogs Trust mainly handles cross-breeds, and would be likely to re-direct a breed dog into a breed association welfare service, like the BDC. What this means is that even home- less Dalmatians are visible mainly as Dalmatians, not as dogs, and to some extent invisible just as dogs. It also suggests that the NCDL's own use of a Dalmatian in their 1996 "Toys Aren't Us" advertis- ing campaign, released to coincide with the film, could itself be seen as an exploitation of the Dalmatian breed image.20 This is not to say that the campaign was irresponsible. Quite the contrary. It means, as I have argued throughout this discussion, that we must continue to re-evaluate the relationship between advertising and film; in par- ticular, that we should entertain the possibility that both have a cre- ative role to play in the production of responsible images of animal ownership.

Ihere are striking exceptions, such as James bond, lhe concept ot the breed image gives us considerable insight into why the Bond stereotype of masculinity has a mode of cinematic longevity usually reserved for animals. 4. Bill Peet was the storyteller and animator to whom Walt Disney gave an unprecedented sole creative authority over the production. See Peet (1994). 5. Note that the title became a number rather than words in the 1990s, a fact that will be significant to my argument in due course. Notwithstanding, I use the formulation 101 as a generic title where suitable. 6. Julian-Ottie holds the copyright to her illustrations. The publisher's blurb points out that "she has drawn Missis, Pongo, Perdita and all fifteen puppies from life", the point being, at least implicitly, that her illustrations are not copies of Peeťs cartoons. By contrast, the contractual conditions of Peeťs employment with Disney gave him no authorial rights in his work, and he received credits only for story and character styling. His disillusion with this situation contributed to his decision to give up animation and become a children's writer and illustrator. 7.

Bambi , for instance, was adapted from a novel of 1923 by Austrian writer Siegmund Salzmann, who published under the name Felix Salten. Salten's output was dominated by animal stories which functioned as allegories of the political conflicts that led up to the humiliation of the Austrian people in the Anschluss of 1938. Amongst these were Florìan Das Pferd des Kaisers (1933) the story of a noble Lippizaner stallion reduced to pulling a carriage through the streets of Vienna after World War 1. 1 1 . "Vertical integration" refers to the economic structure of the Hollywood mode of production from the early 1920s to the late 1940s, whereby the studios owned the means of distribution and exhibition as well as production. This monopoly was challenged by antitrust proceedings, leading to the Paramount decree of 1947, by which studios were obliged to divest themselves of their systems of distribution and exhibition. 12. Thanks to Mark Hugill of Xtreme Information for data on Dalmatians in contemporary advertising. 13. Prior to 1995 (when advance publicity for the live action 101 became wide- spread), the Dalmatian's media presence was almost solely limited to a Pedigree Chum campaign in 1985 featuring Avril Bale Stock, owner of a then top-winning dog, and to the "Derek the Dalmatian" campaign in 1987 for Bernard Matthew's "Top Class" canned dog food. Both campaigns had connotations of pedigree and class rather than appearance and behaviour. 14.

We might glance back at those two advertising campaigns of the 1980s, referred to in n. 13 above, both with connotations of pedigree and class rather than behaviour and appearance. It may be that there is an aspect of the enterprise cul- ture of the mid-late 80s that aligns with a rise in the popularity of breed dogs, but it is beyond the scope of this discussion to develop this idea. 20. It should be noted that the "Toys 'R' Us" chain worked in partnership with Mattel as Disney's official toy licensees. References Allen, Robert C. and Douglas Gomery. 1985.
