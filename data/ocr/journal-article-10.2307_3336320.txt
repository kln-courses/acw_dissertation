At the same time the increasing demand for nontraditional objects, such as argillite carvings, opened new markets. The focus of all this museum-related eupho- ria, hysteria, one-upmanship, adventure, and hard work was the objects made and used by Northwest Coast peoples. In the epilogue, Cole struggles with the significance of these works and seems reluctant to accept the mate- rial as art. As an art historian, I find his attitude disturbing: "...some public art museums are reluctant to accord it [ethnological material] a status equivalent to easel painting or European sculpture. But, right or wrong, artifact has become art...(p. 285). Cole continues in a footnote: "Probably it [Native American art] should not be conceived of in such terms [easel painting and European sculpture], except, of course, the zw(rk of contemporary artists. It [Native American art] is decorative art, which is not the same, though not inferior to, 'fine art' " (p. 357, italics mine). How weary this begins to sound. Faced with our increasing comprehension of the power and sophistication of Northwest Coast art, softshoe semantics seem out of place in the 1980s. Surely the fact that it is different from "our" art is no reason to give it another name. Cole's feelings about this material do not detract from his major contribution, which is to describe the historical process of Northwest Coast art collection. His survey, complete in itself, leads one to speculate about the details of collecting in other parts of the United States. The material culture of the Northwest Coast was attractive and plentiful, but it was only one of hundreds of cultures of interest to muse- ums-and the great collecting boom of the late nineteenth century affected all areas of the country. Cole has approached art historical material from a new angle, and we begin to see in new ways. It might be instructive to ex- pand our vision further. Zena Pearlstone Los Angeles, California COSTUMES OF MEXICO Chloe Sayer University of Texas Press, Austin, 1985. 240 pp., 100 b/wz &amp; 36 color illustrations, 3 appendixes, glossary, bibliography, index. $29.95 cloth, $18.95 paper. In the introduction to this volume, Chloe Sayer states: "When Indians are in a state of transi- tion and are being absorbed into the national culture, costume is often one of the first as- pects of their own indigenous culture to disap- pear" (pp.10-11). Yet the 200 pages that follow belie this pronouncement. As the author traces 2,000 years of Indian costume development, emphasizing the numerous transitions and disruptions in Indian life during the past 450 years, she demonstrates the remarkable viva- city, adaptability, and ingenuity evident in the dress of Mexico's indigenous peoples. The book sets itself an ambitious task: it surveys native Mexican dress from ancient to modern times, incorporating historical data as well as copious information on clothing types and techniques of manufacture. Though the 26 I</page><page sequence="2">book is an important contribution to the liter- ature, its success at this monumental endeavor is uneven. The text consists of three parts, divided into eight chapters. I shall consider each in turn. "Part I: Costumes before the Conquest" consists of two chapters, "Central Mexico, the Gulf Coast, and the Maya," and "Oaxaca, Guerrero, and the Aztec Empire." These are confusingly titled, for the Aztec material is not subsumed under Central Mexico. Examination of these chapters reveals that the real distinc- tion here is a chronological one. Chapter one deals mainly with Pre-Classic and Classic peri- od materials, chapter two with Post-Classic data gleaned principally from codices and from early sixteenth-century literary and pictorial sources. Part I is the least satisfactory portion of the book. Sayer's effort to provide archaeological background in the first chapter results in a half- accurate, sketchy synthesis. Her information on archaeological textiles is useful, but seems to derive mainly from two textile articles in the Handbook of Middle American Indians (though she does not directly credit these sources). To focus on just one example, she considers tex- tile fragments found at Teotihuacan, and brief- ly mentions the evidence in ceramic and mural art for clothing styles of Classic Period Cen- tral Mexico, but she does not illustrate any of these. She refers to the "city of Tlamimilolpa" (p. 21), which is in actuality a residential com- pound at Teotihuacan. Her coverage of the Maya is better, although more comparative drawings would bolster her discussion. Chapter two is more satisfactory, for here the author has the rich textual sources of the conquest to rely upon. Sayer writes well, and she successfully evokes Aztec sumptuary display. While she does cite Patricia Anawalt's Indian Clothing before Cortez (University of Oklahoma Press, 1981), Sayer should refer the reader more directly to this masterful synthesis of ancient Mesoamerican costume, which pro- vides the in-depth, well-illustrated analysis of the Pre-Columbian period that Sayer's volume does not. "Part II: The Post-Conquest Heritage" is divided into two parts, "Costume in New Spain (1521-1821)" and "Independence and After (1821-1917)." In both chapters, Sayer excels at formulating capsule summaries of history, setting clothing into its social context. She admirably illustrates that textile history is, indeed, social history and that changes in in- digenous clothing result directly from political, economic, and social changes in the society at large. Sayer analyzes the forced adoption of European clothing styles as well as the volun- tary appropriation of Hispanic garb and needle- work techniques by the Indians. Though she discusses clothing styles of all classes of society (Indian, Mestizo, Creole, and Hispanic), in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, clothing of the wealthy is of course the best documented. By the nineteenth cen- tury, urban travelers and archaeological ex- plorers began to devote more attention to In- dians and Mestizos in their writings and illus- trations. Sayer includes several color plates of Continued on page 84 MONBRISON 2, RUE DES BEAUX ARTS 75006 PARIS - Tel. 46.34.05.20 . _~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,,, 27</page><page sequence="3">unlike other Idoma carved masks in style and iconography, Ekwaja also bears no close re- semblance to any Igala mask I have seen, in- cluding those associated with the Ata. In ad- dition it is quite unlike those in use in nearby Igbo communities. The royal line in Agila claims descent from Igala, thus legitimizing its right to rule. To rein- force this claim, which is partly historical and partly a mythical charter, a number of symbols are employed that are said to derive from Idah. One such symbol is Ekwaja, a carved and blackened female mask dressed in solid red (probably formerly ododo but now commercial) cloth and holding two brass bells, of European type but identified locally with Idah. The coif- fure of twin cones (seen not in Agila but fur- ther south) is ringed by a woven fillet into which are placed three red feathers. Prominent protruding ears are pierced by pendant ear- rings of brown glass beads, worn by all royals in Agila and also identified with Idah. The corners of the small open mouth are accen- tuated with "cat's whisker" scars (not seen in Agila today), and vertical keloids mark the forehead from hairline to the bridge of the nose. The eyes are of a cowry shape never seen in Idoma anthropomorphic masks. The pro- portions of the face are much broader than those of Idoma face masks, and more im- portant, it is not painted white but black. If there were any doubt as to the mask's gender, this is made very explicit by its owners and reinforced in performance. When Ekwaja enters the village playground, she sits motion- less until a woman spectator calls, "Oo-hoo- hoo! How beautiful you are!" She then rises and dances slowly to a complex drumbeat that differs markedly from that of other Agila mas- querades. Her title, ekwataida (ekwu-Ata-Ida), "mask of the king of Idah," makes clear her royal association. Her measured, careful stance and movement pattern reinforce this persona. The Agila people say that she impersonates Aja, the beautiful first wife of one of the Atas of Idah. The only scholar to have mentioned Ek- waja was R.G. Armstrong (Peoples of the Niger- Benue Confluence, 1955), who speculated that Aja might possibly be identified with the legendary first female Ata of Idah, rendered by Clifford as Ejaunu (i.e., Eja=Aja). But John Boston (The Igala Kingdolm, 1968) transcribes this as Ebelejonu, (i.e., Ebele-ejonu), which is linguistically too far removed to be a real possibility. Nonetheless, given the frequent claim that candidates for the kingship of Agila formerly traveled to Idah for their investiture,or at least to receive the beads of office and other regalia, the evidence of oral tradition reinforces a possi- ble Igala origin. Furthermore, the mask's style, while not close to any of the reported Igala ex- amples, bears a greater family resemblance to Igala masks than to Idoma or Igbo ones (e.g., the Egwu Ata masks in Neyt, pp. 40-42). The most perplexing aspect of this is that there appear to be no contemporary counterparts of Ekwaja in Igala kingdom itself. This does not preclude the possibility of an Igala origin, for there is a tendency for masquerades to "go to the bush" when political expediency dictates. It is therefore possible that Ekwaja is a mas- querade that once existed in Igalaland but now lives on in southern Idoma as a historical rem- nant. The alternative seems to be that it is, and always was, a local masquerade found only in Agila and invented for the express purpose of validating the royal house's cherished connec- tion to Idah. If that were so, we might expect that it would be executed in a style closer to the Idoma norm. I would be very interested in the reactions of other scholars to these spe- culations, particularly anyone who has worked in Igala. Sidney Littlefield Kasfir Middlebury College books Continued from page 27 Nebel's lithographs (1836) and Garcia Cubas's illustrations (1876) depicting the hybrid dress of the indigenous populations during this era. This section of the text features some especially well-chosen illustrations, including a number of notable pieces from the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Among these are some fine Maya textiles donated by the explorer Maudslay. These two chapters form the valuable core of the book. Many anthropologists, art histori- ans, and archaeologists who will use this vol- ume are most familiar with the archaeological past discussed in Part I and the ethnographic present of Part III. Part II successfully fills in the gaps and links the two. The text of Costumes of Mexico is divided almost equally between pre-twentieth-century and twentieth-century material. The four chap- ters of "Part III: Twentieth-Century Mexico" constitute exactly half the book. They are "Fibres, Spinning and Dyeing," "Weaving, Embroidery and Other Decorative Techniqu- es," "Contemporary Male Dress," and "Con- temporary Female Dress." Sayer seems most authoritative in the first two of these chapters, which provide an outstanding introduction to materials and techniques. She discusses with equal facility both indigenous skills and the myriad innovations to the native textile artist's repertory. The last two chapters survey male and female costume throughout Mexico. Here, the level of discourse and cursory treatment of a large body of material is best suited for a general, nonscholarly audience. Paradoxical- ly, it is these readers who may be most con- fused by these chapters, however. When the author moves from the Tarahumara and Hui- chol to the Tzeltal, Totonac, Huave, and Yuca- tec Maya in one paragraph (p.191), the reader who lacks prior familiarity with these ethnic groups and their geographic settings may have some trouble keeping up. In these two chap- ters, Sayer discusses a lot of clothing that is not illustrated, and she does not refer the reader to illustrations in other books, as is customary. This limits their value. Moreover, these two chapters do not define regional dif- ferences well, nor do they elucidate individual versus village style within regions. Yet many books published in Mexico have focused end- lessly on regional costume differences with- out providing the adequate overview and historical dimension that Sayer successfully achieves. The author sums up the volume in a brief (7 pp.) but eloquent conclusion about accul- turative forces and reasons for the gradual abandonment of traditional garb in many pue- blos. This is followed by three well-illustrated appendixes on the backstrap loom, weaving techniques, and embroidery stitches. A useful glossary of Hispanic, Indian, and weaving terms is provided as well. The volume is handsomely illustrated with numerous line drawings and photos, including a full thirty-six pages of high quality color plates. On one of the maps, the state of Chia- 84 EKWAJA MASK. AGILA, 1978.</page><page sequence="4">pas was inadvertently omitted from the list of states and their Indian villages (p. 11); its com- munities are listed under Oaxaca. The most serious flaw in the book is the lack of proper text citations or footnotes: there are none. While the bibliography is excellent and the index is quite thorough, the scholarly reader needs a better coordination between text and bibliography. The author repeatedly presents detailed, specialized information with no reference to her sources. When she does cite an authority, the offhand manner of so do- ing reduces the usefulness of the reference. A few examples, all taken from just one fifteen- page section of the text, will suffice to indicate the enormity of the problem. On page 99, the author quotes directly from four nineteenth- century observers: Garcia Cubas, Bullock, Ty- lor, and Calderon de la Barca. While in each instance it is simple enough to consult the bibliography for the volume citation, no page numbers are ever given for direct quotes. In some instances, simply consulting the biblio- graphy is not so helpful. In an interesting discussion of the evolution of the rebozo (p. 106), she mentions the work of Ruth Lechuga. The bibliography lists four studies by Lechu- ga, all published in Mexico, and all difficult to get in this country. The researcher who wants to explore the rebozo reference further must do at least four times as much work as should be necessary to track down the proper volume, and then proceed to hunt for a passage on the history of the rebozo. In a very interesting discussion of the many ethnic in- fluences on the development of the Saltillo sarape, Sayer says, "Imported textiles may also have been influential. As Paula Maria Juelke points out, these came from the Philippines, China, the East Indies, Holland, and Spain, which had in turn inherited a range of Moorish designs" (p. 103). Juelke is not listed separately in the bibliography. One must either know that she is the second author, with James Jeter, of an important catalogue on the Saltillo sarape, or else comb all entries to find her name. (Thank God the first author's name begins with J also!). Elsewhere Sayer refers to the work of "Electra and Tonatiuh Gutierrez" (p. 109). In the bibliography, a book by Gutier- rez and Momprade is listed, but in actuality, Electra Momprade is the first author of this work. Sayer also cites the work of many in- dividuals who are not listed in the biblio- graphy at all (Jimenez-Moreno, on p. 93, for example). Is this personal communication? Work in progress? Unpublished manuscript? While not of pressing interest to the general reader, such lacunae will infuriate the textile scholar who tries to use this book. In summary, every conceivable type of biblio- graphic confusion results from this lack of at- tention to the rudiments of proper reference citation. I don't think the University of Texas Press would tolerate this scholarly sloppiness in a work on European history or Classical ar- chaeology. Why relax the standards here? Is it that textile studies are still thought to be peripheral to scholarly pursuits? Even if this book is aimed at the general public, it could easily have footnotes listed unobtrusively at the end. Despite my severe criticisms, I do find this to be a lovely and useful book, generously il- lustrated and packed with important informa- tion. It is as close as we are likely to come for some time to a one-volume English-language work on this topic. It is unfortunate that the editors at the University of Texas Press did not demand that Costumes of Mexico conform to their usual high standards of scholarly refer- encing. Had they done so, it would truly be a first-rate reference book as well as a readable, lively introduction to the rich topic of Mexican Indian dress. Janet Catherine Berlo University of Missouri-St. Louis PUEBLO INDIAN TEXTILES A Living Tradition Kate Peck Kent School of American Research Press, Santa Fe, 1983. xiv + 118 pp., 80 b/w &amp; 30 color illustrations, map, bibliography. $14.95 paper. The history of textile production reaches back nearly two millennia in the American South- west. In Pueblo Indian Textiles: A Living Tradi- tion, Kate Peck Kent examines the historic and contemporary weaving traditions of the Pueblo peoples of Arizona and New Mexico. In parti- cular, she is concerned with the "textiles made in the indigenous tradition during the classic period of historic Pueblo weaving, 1848 to 1880, and to those that represent modifications of classic forms" (p. 6). The book thus serves as a companion volume to Kent's other book- length study of Southwestern textiles, Pre- historic Textiles of the Southwest. The author looks at textiles from historical, technical, and functional perspectives. She first considers the evolution of historic Pueblo tex- tiles, from the Spanish to the modern period. Then she discusses the technical elements of historic Pueblo weaving and the varieties of Pueblo textiles. In an appendix, Kent presents a detailed catalogue of the Pueblo textile col- lection of the School of American Research, where she conducted the research for the book and from whose collection she draws most of her examples. Pueblo textiles are much less well known than their Southwestern counterparts, Navajo blankets and rugs. Kent attributes this to the fact that the more recent Pueblo textiles have been created for internal consumption, rather than for an external market. As she says: "Much of the fascination of Navajo weaving lies in its variety and innovativeness of design and in the ways in which it has changed through the years to meet the demands of the market place. Traditional Pueblo textiles do not have this kind of appeal. They must be appre- ciated, instead, for their historical significance, their cultural authenticity, and the technical proficiency that many of them display" (p. 8). Kent charts four periods in the development of historic Pueblo textiles. During the period of Spanish domination, lasting from A.D. 1540 to 1848, she sees several important shifts taking place. Although much of the prehistoric technology-upright treadleless looms and spinning yarn with a stick spindle and whorl-survived the period, other elements of 85 By Appointment AFRICAN ART Genevieve McMillan 40 Bow Street Harvard Square Cambridge Massachusetts 02138 (617) 864-0629 african/wood conservation angela van slyke kennedy &amp; associates art conservation 2505 mandell houston, tx 77006 (713) 520-1808 ___ I ---? --- - ?~__ ~~~r _ ^^rr?T^7^^y~~~~I^^^^ __ f ^TCT ^^B __^^y3[^t^?^^^ __^^^Kl?L1TTT^N^ff^?^^^^ _ =_^^^^^^^^^ r_?L1TCI?liCIIII?1111? if 11I1TrEii7 E</page></plain_text>
