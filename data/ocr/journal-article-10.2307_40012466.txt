<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE "QUICK WAY" WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM Apologists and critics of theistic beliefs have long supposed, in their practice, that significant points could be scored, one way or the other, by making observations about the alleged origins of such beliefs. For many years the authority of the prophets or of the apostles or of the Church Fathers was pointed to as support for the theistic claims of Christianity; and the origination of religious be- liefs in special revelatory experience was alleged as a basis of added credibility. More recently the tide has tended in the opposite direc- tion, and critics of theism have sought to discredit it, in what I call the "quick way," by attacking its worth through an assault upon its origins. There are undoubtably connections between origins and worth in the domain of religious (and other) beliefs; it will be the aim of this essay to clarify such connections and to show something of their complexity; but much of the reliance on the "quick way" has been misguided. I David Hume and Auguste Comte both considered it significant that theism began long before the Age of Enlightenment, in which they rejoiced, and both used the argument that something with its origins so deep in the barbarous ages of ignorance and superstition must be regarded with suspicion from the outset. Hume, of course, does not limit his anti-theistic argument to this "quick way." On the contrary, some of the richest textured discussion in classic modern philosophy of religion is to be found in Hume's writings. But in his essay "Of Miracles," Hume clearly employs the argument from ori- gins to add to the burden of credibility set upon the defender of traditional religious belief. It forms a strong presumption against all supernatural and miraculous relations, that they are observed chiefly to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations; or if a civilized people has ever given admission to any of them, that people will be</page><page sequence="2">328 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION found to have received them from ignorant and barbarous an- cestors, who transmitted them with that inviolable sanction and authority, which always attend received opinions. 1 Hume never admits - never even considers - the possibility that there might have been certain privileged times (or chosen peoples) at which (or to whom) special revelatory events might have occurred. His ground for failing to entertain such a crucial hypothesis is clearly, in the context, his uniformitarian assumptions about historical happenings and about human nature: It is strange, a judicious reader is apt to say, upon the perusal of these wonderful historians, that such prodigious events never happen in our days. But it is nothing strange, I hope, that men should lie in all ages. You must surely have seen instances en- ough of that frailty. 2 Thus with one stroke Hume has discounted all contentions that there might have been something unusual going on in the intercourse between gods and men, or that at certain times and in favorable illuminating circumstances it is possible for even simple hearts (note the contrast in overtones between "simple" and "barbarous") to be put in touch with profound truths. Hume may (or may not) be right in his uniformitarian premise, but in adopting it straightaway here he has begged the main question against his theistic opponents. Hume's "quick way" from origins requires not taking seriously the theological claims that are the essence of the matter for the believer. Why must all times be considered equally propitious for God to reveal himself? Why should the sophisticates of the world be assumed to have better qualifications than simple folk for receiving profound religious truths? Perhaps there are impressive arguments in favor of these metaphysical and epistemological principles, but to vindicate them against contrary arguments from well-developed theistic world- views will require plunging into the detailed texture of philosophic point and counterpoint. Hume is quite willing, as I have noted, to take this needed plunge; but to this extent his "quick way" from the origins of theism is irrelevant to his case and serves only to muddy waters that are hard, at best, to keep clear. 1 David Hume, Enquiries Concerning the Human Understanding, Section X, Part II, ed.

Selby-Bigge (Oxford: Clarendon Press, Second Edition, 1955) p. 119. 2 Ibid. pp. 119-120.</page><page sequence="3">THE "QUICK WAY" WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM 329 Auguste Comte places even more essential weight on the ancient beginnings of theistic religion. For Comte the Law of the Stages could be relied upon to show that the theological way of thinking was (and is) now outmoded. Such thinking was a primitive animistic way of unifying observations and correlating concepts, he argues, but it was long ago made obsolete by the impersonal metaphysical mode of thought; and now, in modern times, even the metaphysical has given way, properly, to the scientific (positivistic) way of thinking in which the observable itself is the adequate basis for predictive understand- ing and control. 3 Anyone who is "on a level with their era" 4 will therefore think positivistically, not theistically. Theistic beliefs are discredited simply because they owe their origins to a stage in human history that has been outgrown. Unfortunately for Comte's "quick way," the Law of the Stages has little to commend it as capturing a real empirical regularity in human history or in human psychological development. Empirical thinkers, metaphysical speculators, and theological believers have a way of being contemporaries, though in different mixes at different times and in various cultures. Different ways of thinking may pre- dominate under different circumstances, but there is nothing in the rhythms of actual social observation to indicate that there is an in- variant serial order that runs from theology through metaphysics to positive science, as Comte thought. Periods of religious skepticism alternate with periods of religious revival. Whether the content of religious belief is worth much or little, therefore, is a matter for more substantive consideration than whether at some given time they happen to be in or out of fashion. Marx and Freud both offered what they deemed to be such sub- stantive considerations, though still in terms of the attack on religion through its origins, by appealing to the causes of theistic belief within human individuals rather than to the mere beginnings of such be- liefs in times long past. Marx's "quick way" was to denounce theistic belief as "ideology" generated by the material circumstances of society, and to argue that the (falsifying) origin of theistic, "other-worldly" religion was exposed in the need of the economically oppressed classes for an "opiate" to give consolation for what their masters cruelly deny them in this world. Setting aside theistic religion as a whole, as Marx's 3 Auguste Comte, Introduction to Positive Philosophy, ed. Frederick Ferre (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill Co., Inc., 1970), p. 2. 4 Ibid. p. 4.</page><page sequence="4">330 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION argument from origins permitted him to do, made it unnecessary to give any detailed examination to the specific claims of religious doc- trine - one basic reason for the absence of any really sophisticated philosophy of religion within Marxist thinking to this day. The difficulty in Marx's "quick way" with theism is that his ideo- logical dismissal from class origins both fails to account for contrary social effects from certain forms of theism, as from Judaism and Christianity, and further fails to settle any questions of truth or fal- sity that may then arise. Sometimes, it is apparent, religions finding their focus of worship in a supernatural being like God do distract attention from this world and function as an "opiate of the people." But sometimes, as well, Christian and Jewish theisms have in fact re- directed urgent attention upon economic and political relationships. The great prophetic tradition of early Judaism was very much attun- ed to worldly matters. Marx himself stands in this tradition, directing stern polemics against exploitation in society in terms of a firm backdrop of perceived ultimate reality. Christianity, inheriting the pro- phetic tradition along with the Hebrew Scriptures, has also stimulated movements of social reform. Quite in contrast to its (also note- worthy) role as sanctifier of the status quo, Christianity can at times challenge its adherents to adventures in "creative insecurity."5 The Marxist ideological dismissal does not seem to work, even on its own sociological ground. Why not? Could it be that sometimes the power of God breaks freshly through even the sin-hardened hearts of smug "social" religionists? This is to pose the question in the language of theistic belief itself, of course, but what is wrong with that? What makes the materialist explanations of Marx better than the super- naturalist answers of theists themselves? To reply once more in terms of the Marxist ideological "quick way" would be question-begging. Again, more substantive and detailed arguments become necessary to supplement the appeal merely to socio-economic causes. Freud, too, offered a "quick way" to set aside the claims of theism by arguing that belief in God originates in certain psychological cau- ses that make religious belief of this kind an "illusion."6 Although he used arguments from both kinds of origin, i.e. based on his con- tempt for primitive and ignorant historical beginnings as well as on 5 See Peter A. Bertocci, Religion as Creative Insecurity (N.Y.: Association Press, 1958). 6 Sigmund Freud, The Future of An Illusion, translated by W.D. Robson-Scott, ed. James Strachey (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday &amp; Co. 1964).</page><page sequence="5">THE QUICK WAY WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM 331 his diagnosis of neurotic psychological causes, the latter became his primary contribution to the literature of the "quick way" of assessing the worth of theistic belief. Faith in God, on Freudian theory, arises out of the need for wish-fulfillment in a hostile and unsatisfying world, both physical and social. We fear the power of raw nature and feel the need for protection by a father-figure like the remembered, seem- ingly omnipotent father of our infancy; thus, out of this felt need, we believe in an invisible Father who is in benevolent control of all events: "The Lord is my Shepherd." We also need the bolstering by self-esteem and by promised reward that comes from supposing that our values are supported in the universe at large, and that virtue (so contrary to our natural desires, but so essential to the possibility of civilized existence 7) will be rewarded ultimately even though, perhaps, only in "another world." Thus, we believe in an Anthropomorphic Creator to flatter our egos and in a Cosmic Cop to keep ourselves (and our neighbors) in line. Such belief, caused by the need to satisfy wishes, is in Freud's sense "illusion." Therefore theism is set aside as illusion, and our new urgent task is to find alternative sound scientific bases for self-esteem and social control. 8 The Freudian dismissal, however, is premature. Believers in God may, of course, argue that Freud's analysis of the dynamics of reli- gious believing is grossly incomplete;9 but even within the Freudian framework it is possible for believers to demand continued attention to their claims. A believer may continue to argue, for example, that the mechanisms of ego-need that Freud has pointed out are exactly the mechanisms created in us by God himself to make sure that we will not stray too far, in our secular pride, from his everlasting concern. "Our heart," as Augustine put it, "is restless, until it repose in Thee."10 Why? Because "Thou madest us for Thyself." Why not? Could God not use wish-fulfillment as a means of indirect self- revelation, if that is his will? Why is such a suggestion plausible or implausible? Just because a belief is motivated by wish-fulfillment (hence in this specialized sense is an "illusion") does not necessarily mean that it is untrue. Even Freud acknowledged that his belief in the 7 Sigmund Freud, Civilization and its Discontents, translated and edited by James Strachey (N.Y.: W.W.

When is an "illusion" reasonable? Might be- lief in God be one such reasonable (or true) illusion? Why or why not? These issues remain, despite the attempted Freudian "quick way" with the worth of theism. The need for the finer texture of philosophical debate remains unabated by any of the appeals to origin - historic or causal - that we have considered. II A new voice lifted recently in defense of the importance of obser- vations about origins to the reasonableness or truth of theism is that of Albert W. Wald. 12 Wald develops a carefully conditional argum- ent for the (logical) possibility that empirical discoveries concerning the origins of theism may, under some circumstances, give us signi- ficant grounds for assessing the worth of such belief. And, if this is so, he concludes: "Since 'religious questions' and 'philosophical ques- tions about religion' could be answered by scientific means, they might well be thought to be scientific questions or at least to be scientific questions about religion rather than philosophical questions about religion." 13 I doubt that Wald's argument supports any such major conclusion about the relationship of science to the assessment of the worth of religious belief, but it is a bold effort in behalf of an old tradition and is therefore well worth scrutiny. Wald begins with the familiar distinctions between the two senses in which beliefs may be said to have an "origin": origin in terms of beginning (history) and origin in terms of cause (psychology) . 14 To this he adds the equally familiar distinction between truth value and reasonableness, as two senses in which a belief may be considered 11 Freud, The Future of an Illusion, op. cit., Chapter X. 12 Albert W. Wald, "The Origins and the Worth of Theism," The International Journal for Philosophy of Religion (Volume V, No, 1, Spring 1974), pp. 45-60. 13 Ibid., p. 59. 14 Oddly, Wald charges my treatment ol this subject in my Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion (N.Y.: Scribners, 1967). pp. 85-86, with having over- looked this distinction. That charge is especially puzzling since I begin the subsection in question with a topic sentence which reads: "One of the ways to explore the doctrinal element of religion is to approach it 'genetically,' that is, with a primary interest in its origins: its historical or psychological roots in the lives of religious persons" (last two emphases added) . Then I divide the subsection into two paragraphs , one dealing with psychological causes and the second with historical beginnings. To his accusation of "vagueness" on this point I must therefore plead "not guilty."</page><page sequence="7">THE QUICK WAY WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM 333 to have (or lack) "worth." 15 Then, with two senses of "origin" and two meanings for "worth," he is ready to set up a set of four claims which he proposes to attack: 1. The beginnings of a belief are irrelevant to its truth value. 2. The causes of a belief are irrelevant to its truth value. 3. The beginnings of a belief are irrelevant to its rationality. 4. The causes of a belief are irrelevant to its rationality. 16 The attack itself is carried on by means of an argument form that is essentially the same in each case: Assume that the beginnings (or causes) or a belief are such that, under those circumstances, such a belief is usually false (unreasonable) ; then, if theistic belief can be shown empirically to have such beginnings (or causes), it will pro- bably be false (unreasonable) . The argument form is straight modus ponens. "If p is thus-and-so begun (caused), then p is probably false (unreasonable) ; but p is thus-and-so begun (caused) ; therefore p is probably false (unreasonable) ." The same argument form, of course, would admit of being used to show the probable truth (or reason- ableness) of theistic beliefs, in principle, if it can show the opposite. Wald takes care to acknowledge this, formally, in his article. But since all his examples of actual arguments to fill his abstract argum- ent form illustrate what he takes to be ways of discrediting the truth (or reasonableness) of theistic belief, it will simplify matters stylistic- ally if we simply let this two-edged character of the abstract argument form be understood and get down to the interesting specifics of whether or not Wald has found a new "quick way" to undercut the worth of theistic belief. For this purpose we should hear Wald's argument against claim number 1. (above) in full: Suppose that the belief that there is a god was first held by virtually all members of a culture c at time t and place p and that they believed substantially the same proposition that many people believe today. Also suppose that these people were ex- tremely ignorant; so ignorant that most of what they believed was false. Saddled with such ignorance, they were beset by 15 My discussion of this matter in Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion, op. cit., was mainly in terms of the reasonableness of beliefs, since the aim of the chapter was, as I stated, "to help us judge responsibly how reasonable it is to be religious or to have a religion" (original emphasis), Ibid., p. 84. 16 Wald, op. cit., p. 47.</page><page sequence="8">334 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION fears and insecurity. They were so unable to adapt to their en- vironment that they soon perished. Suppose that one's belief that there is a god had such begin- nings. Also suppose that either no other evidence for the truth or falsity of the proposition is available or all the available evid- ence is equally balanced between truth and falsity. In this case one can infer that the proposition that there is a god is probably false if it is meaningful at all. The reason for this is as follows. Since most of what was believed by the people in c at t and at p was false, it is more likely that the proposition that there is a god is false than that it is true, for it is one of the propositions believed in c at t and p. Thus, if one's belief that a god exists began in such surroundings, then certainly this would show that the proposition one believed is probably false. 17 The argument against claim number 2. (above) is similar: Suppose that what causes the people of culture c to believe that there is a god is their belief that a god will fulfill their [sic] need for security together with their desire for security. Suppose also that most of the beliefs that are caused by such a desire for security are beliefs in false propositions. In this case there is empirically establishable information about the causes of the belief that would show that the proposition believed by these people was probably false. 18 Likewise the arguments against claims numbered 3. and 4. (above) take the same form: Surely if someone both had good reason to accept [the Freudian Theory] and that person realized [N.B. !] that this scientific claim implied that probably there is no god, then it would be reasonable for that person to believe that there is no god... Exactly the same situations obtain if one considers the causes instead of the beginnings of theism. 19 On this basis Wald declares that he has demonstrated the "irra- tionality" of the view "that scientific enquiries into the origins of beliefs could not possibly provide information about the worth of those beliefs. ..."20 How shall we weigh his achievement? 17 Ibid., pp. 48-49. 18 Ibid., p. 49. 19 Ibid. 20 Ibid., p. 60.</page><page sequence="9">THE QUICK WAY' WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM 335 I wish to acknowledge, first, that Wald's arguments are formally valid. If we adopt as the first premise that most of the beliefs in a given set of beliefs are false (unreasonable), then when we add the second premise that belief p is a member of that set and that nothing more is known about p, it follows that belief p is probably false (un- reasonable) . It is upon this impeccable principle that Wald relies each time. The analogue familiar to all students of probability theory is of the urn full of little balls that are colored either black or white. If it is stipulated that most of the balls in the urn are black, then any particular ball (the next one, etc.) about which nothing more is known than that it is a ball in the urn, will probably be black. This is a deductive outcome, reflecting the meaning of "pro- bable"; hence Wald is correct in shifting his modal qualifiers at one point when he says: "then certainly this would show that the pro- position one believed is probably false." 21 The certainty of the pro- bability in that case came from Wald's stipulation that "most of what was believed by the people in c... was false," and therefore merely because "it is one of the propositions believed in c..." (eg. it is one of the balls in the urn) , it is more likely to be false (or black) by the rules that have been adopted. In pure logic it would have been equally easy for Wald to have made the case against theism air-tight (though without the plausible empirical appearance) by stipulating that just as all the balls in the urn may be declared black so all the beliefs of culture c may be declared false; the formally valid con- clusion then would have been: "certainly this would show that the proposition one believed is certainly false," since the probabilities of the alternative have been reduced to zero. That would have been what we might call the "quickest way of all' with theism! But Wald sensibly does not choose to suggest it, doubtless because he is in- tent on maintaining that empirical research rather than his logical stipulations are at the heart of the matter. 22 Wald's argument turns out to be formally valid, then, but episte- mologically uninformative. Perhaps this is because, in addition to the felt arbitrariness of mere logical "supposings," one senses that beliefs are being treated as though they were little black or white 21 Ibid., p. 49 (emphasis added) . 22 I suggested this "quickest way" to Wald in personal correspondence of June, 1973, as an objection to an early draft of his article, but although he deals with a number of "replies from critics," he omits mention of this one.</page><page sequence="10">336 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION balls in an urn: purely formally, from the "outside," as it were, without any attention to the finer epistemological texture that makes for the real interest in the subject matter. Of course if a "quick way" is what is being sought, the need to consider any of this finer texture is interpreted as a defeat. But in my judgment the need cannot be evaded, even within the framework of Wald's general position. For one thing, there are many different types of beliefs. To con- sider them only in respect to their being painted black or white (true or false; reasonable or unreasonable) is to fail to notice the many differences among "balls" of the same "color" - and the many shades of gray. I agree with Wald, for example, that sometimes, under some circumstances, we may reasonable adopt a belief (or re- frain from doing so) because of its "origin," in the sense that the credibility of our source plays a part in any rational judgment. Some- times, that is, an argument from authority is reasonable: // the "autho- rity" is really an authority and has the credentials to prove it.23 Wald remarks that ...if one justifies the inference from "Einstein believed that F = ma" to "F = ma is probably true" by appeal to a prin- ciple like: Beliefs of reputable physicists in propositions of elementary physics are probably beliefs in true propositions, then the inference would be cogent. 24 But in the principle he adduces, Wald himself recognizes that differ- ent types of beliefs need to be previously discriminated. Beliefs, even when held by reputable physicists, in propositions of elementary physics are in important ways different from beliefs in propositions in literary criticism, for example, or in foreign policy, or, indeed, in theology. We all know, similarly, that we tend to believe what our doctors tell us about our physical condition; we have good empirical warrant to suppose that it is reasonable to accept as "credentialed" the authority they bring to this domain; but many of us have strong reservations about extending that authority to political beliefs, and the like. It is an elementary condition on the argument from authority, in advance of its employment, that the domain of beliefs in question be carefully distinguished from other domains where the authority of 23 See my Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion, op. cit., pp. 97-98, for addi- tional discussion. 24 Wald, op. cit., p. 51.</page><page sequence="11">THE "QUICK WAY" WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM 337 the source simply fails to pertain. What Wald has done, in ignoring this fine texture regarding different kinds of beliefs when it pertains to his "quick way" with theism, is to have thrown all belief-balls into the same urn without noting that there may be significant logical differences between theistic and other types of beliefs - differences that would make his statistical sample heterogeneous and thus inade- quate for his purpose. Also he fails to note that there may be signifi- cantly different sorts of "credentialing" processes in those different domains of belief. With regard to credentials, it is clear from what has been said already that the credibility of one's sources tends to vary quite specifically with the subject matter. I used to know an old farmer whose beliefs on nearly every subject I considered to be wrong- headed and mulishly perverse. Most of his beliefs, ranging from astronomy (of which he knew nothing) to zippers (which he mis- trusted) , were (let us "suppose," a la Wald) false and unreasonable. But if I wanted to know when a field was ready for mowing or wheth- er a cow was likely to calve in the night, I knew no better authority. Why was this? Because agricultural life was one area in which the old man had had special access to experience that made his judgment - within that area - expert. I would have been foolish to have applied Wald's argument: that seine most of the farmer's beliefs were false, these particular beliefs were probably false, too. The po- pulation of his beliefs was not homogeneous with regard to reliability, as the applicability - in principle - of Wald's "quick way" presup- poses. The differences are what make all the difference! Similarly, to come down to cases, may it not have been that the ancient Hebrews held a set of beliefs that were widely heterogeneous with regard to their truth (or reasonableness) ? Though scientifically ignorant, perhaps some of them were moral geniuses; though no more enlightened than their contemporaries in many subjects, perhaps they were - for various reasons of historical circumstance and heritage - unusually sensitive in spiritual matters, unusually open and re- ceptive to the larger meaning of the events in which they found themselves. If so, then their authority in these domains would be impressive even though the majority of their beliefs (let us suppose) were of little worth. And if so, then the simple inference from (largely) ignorant beginnings to (probably) false or unreasonable beliefs would not follow. How can we tell? How do we know what to suppose about individual (discriminated) types of beliefs</page><page sequence="12">338 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION once we have ceased treating all beliefs in a culture like little black or white balls homogeneously in an urn? The only recourse then is to the careful sorting out of the beliefs themselves. The "logical possibilities" that Wald claims to have unearthed are "possible," then, only in the most vacuous sense of formal self- consistency. As an epistemic "quick way" Wald's approach is not logically possible since the "supposings" that it depends on simply cannot, in principle, reasonably be carried out until after obtaining the results of those substantive philosophical arguments that presum- ably were to have been avoided by turning the matter over to the Department of Anthropology. Before the empirical question of the proportion of false (or unreasonable) beliefs within a given culture can even be considered to be a relevant statistic for or against the support of religious beliefs, in other words, the prior philosophical question of the appropriateness of lumping together the religious beliefs of a culture with the rest of that culture's beliefs must be wrestled with. The same holds true for sifting the worth of beliefs variously caused. Only after this process, necessarily dealing with the fine texture again, would it be logically relevant to conclude, as Wald did, that 'religious questions' and 'philosophical questions about religion5 could be answered by scientific means." But the irony is that in the process of weighing the subset of religious beliefs in question, to decide whether the statistical sampling techniques or psychoanalytical methods of the scientists have any logical point, these questions would have been to that extent "answered" - not by the scientists, of course, but by the logically necessary preliminary work of the philosophers. By then the statistical samplings and the probablistic inferences of the scientists would be seen as the empty exercises they would be; and Wald's conclusion that questions in the philosophy of religion "might well be thought to be scientific ques- tions or at least to be scientific questions about religion rather than philosophical questions about religion" would be perceived to be a hollow hope. Much depends, as it turns out, on Wald's proviso that "no other evidence for the truth or falsity of the proposition is available or all the available evidence is equally balanced between truth and falsity." The key question, then, is whether one's appeal to the wider (cultural or causal) reference class of beliefs may be taken before or only full inquiry has established a perfect epistemic balan-</page><page sequence="13">THE "QUICK WAY" WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM 339 ce in the primary theological reference class. 25 Delaying that appeal to the expanded reference class of beliefs until after full inquiry would be abandoning all pretense of a "quick way," of course, and to that extent my primary case is unaffected. But even after such inquiry, the logical relevance of findings concerning the truth (or reasonableness) of beliefs in the larger cultural reference class to judgements concern- ing the worth of beliefs in the smaller theological reference class is far from clear. As a pragmatic device to assist in decision-making when no adequate grounds are available - like flipping a coin in order to decide which of two equally unknown paths to take, if retracing one's steps and standing still are precluded - so facts about the expand- ed reference class might be psychologically persuasive in obtaining clo- sure. But flipping a coin might after all be less misleading. At least the latter method avoids suggesting that something more is known about the probability of the restricted reference class in question when, ex hypothesi, inquiry has shown that the contrary is the case. If all epistemic considerations are in perfect balance, the logically appro- priate response is suspense of judgment. Admittedly, pragmatic pres- sures may not allow us to suspend decision in many areas of life - religion among them - but Wald's arguments were clearly aimed at the logic, not the pragmatics, of belief. In this, too, we see that they have failed. The importance of noticing the origins of theism is not in making possible some "quick way" of disposing of it (or of philosophy of religion) , then; but I said earlier that the genetic approach to reli- gious belief is not without its value. What may now be said about ihe actual significance of the beginnings and the causes of theistic belief? Ill If we are to clarify the connections between the origins and the worth of theistic beliefs, we had better be careful to specify whose (what kind of) theistic beliefs we are talking about. My interest is not in the beliefs of children nor of fundamentalist atavists from an earlier era. Rather, I am interested here in considering what mature and thoughtful contemporaries, who remain theists, have to learn 25 I am indebted to Professor Christopher Boorse for this suggestion, made in the discussion following the presentation of this paper to the Department of Philosophy at the University of Delaware.</page><page sequence="14">340 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION from a study of the origins, both historical and psychological, of their beliefs. This will need to be no more than a sketch here, but even in brief I wish to point to a more constructive and more complex ap- proach to origins in the philosophy of religion than has been common among the advocates of the "quick way." First, with regard to the historical origins of theistic belief, I sub- mit that sophisticated contemporary theists learn the logic and the essential content of their religious beliefs by comparison and con- trast with the beliefs of their predecessors of long ago. It is impos- sible to suppose, that is, that theistic beliefs can or should carry all of the same functions, today, that they presumably did for pre- scientific men and women living thousands of years ago. Zeus is no longer needed to account for the phenomenon of thunderbolts; Jeho- vah's curse is no longer required to explain the menstrual cycles of women. The fact that early belief in gods and in God arose in a context of ignorance of the principles of modern science is instructive: if scientifically educated men and women continue to find theistic belief religiously important, it is clearly not as a substitute for scien- tific ignorance. Awareness of the origins of theistic belief forces greater discrimina- tion in identifying the various functions of such belief and in select- ing out what is essential. If we assume that once upon a time people relied on their theistic myths to do some jobs of explanation that science now performs with greater adequacy, and if we further as- sume that thoughtful contemporary theists do not require such a function, this forces us to notice what else is (and was) going on in the logic of theistic belief. Freed of the dogmatic notion that all be- liefs are of the same type (empirical) and have only one or two functions (descriptive, explanatory) , contemporary philosophers of religion may set to work analyzing the theistic phenomenon with more richness of concept and perception. A principal function of theistic belief, other than descriptive or explanatory, is to summarize and focus affirmatively the basic values of the believing community. In the images and myths that constitute the evocative background to all such belief, we find the celebration of what is taken as most high and most real. We find this in Greek polytheism, in which various valued traits are divided among a pantheon of gods and are venerated distinctly, at different times and with different rites. The lucidity and restraint of Apollo, the lusty intensity of Aphrodite, the wisdom of Athena, the ecstatic madness</page><page sequence="15">THE "QUICK WAY" WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM 341 of Dionysus - all are vividly displayed, creating the basis for com- munity in shared values. We find the same value-focusing function in the great images of biblical theism, too, in which the supreme values of the originating community are symbolized in stories about the one God and his various relationships with creatures - angelic, human, or natural. The values of personhood, of faithfulness, of love, and the rest, are woven into the rich tapestry of legend and myth that is the matrix for both Christian and Jewish beliefs of a more explicit sort. Those more explicit beliefs, the doctrines that philosophers usually turn to first, function to articulate the primary imagery of theistic faith in propositional form. Rational theology articulates and syste- matizes the value matrix to allow believers to think consistently in terms of the supreme values which are otherwise expressed and re- inforced in worship. Some of the beliefs of theists are mainly needed for systematic purposes, then, as in the doctrine of the Two Natures of Christ (which preserves the intensely held values on both sides of the image of Christ as truly God and truly man), or as in the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception (which allows Mary, inten- sely valued in her own right, to stand outside of the biologically trans- mitted line of Original Sin so as to be a fit vessel for the Infant God himself) . Other functions, once the development of systematic doctrine has matured, include the affirmation of specific community through creeds and other means of group identification. Many theists say things in creeds (and sing them in hymns) as a way of associating themselves with a great heritage - the "fellowship of saints" - and utter the familiar propositions sincerely, affirmatively, but with- out literal intent. Other things are going on, when a thoughtful con- temporary theist expresses his belief in "the ascension of Christ" than the silly supposition that Jesus lifted off from the earth like a Saturn rocket headed for the moon! And when someone assents to the proposition that Jesus "sitteth at the right hand of God the Father," such a person need not be supposed to accept with this that God has a pair of buttocks (to sit on) or that his "hand" has fingernails. Other functions can be identified, once the origin of theistic belief in the ordering and expressing of values is noticed as basic to the development of historical religion. I shall not attempt to complete the</page><page sequence="16">342 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION list here. 26 But one last word on the history of the explanatory func- tion of theistic beliefs may be of special interest to philosophers of religion. In so far as people give an explanatory use to their funda- mental value imagery (and historically it is manifest that this has been done at all times) , it is because among their genuine values is the desire for a sensed comprehensibility of the whole context in which their lives are set. In some religious traditions this desire is discouraged (e.g. Zen Buddhism, and some strands of Christianity which profess to glory in paradox or absurdity), but in the main- stream of Western theism the value of understanding is compatible with the set of values symbolized in the mythic matrix of the religion. This is certainly true of most Greek polytheism, despite the funda- mentalist obscurantism that emerged from time to time to plague philosophers in Athens, It is also true that in most Christian tradi- tions the legitimacy of the craving for understanding is woven into the fabric of faith itself. When this is the case, those seeking to understand the world com- patibly with their images of fundamental value have made use, natur- ally enough, of whatever the best in contemporary culture can pro- vide. Often this best has not been any too good, from our smug standpoint. This is why the images of theism have been entangled so long with prescientific misconceptions of the natural order. This is why, as well, the mythic matrix of Christianity has been articulated in theological theory deeply dependent for its basic categories on the philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. A study of the origins of such efforts to relate Christian theism to the rest of the world of know- ledge reveals the extent to which the intellectual history of late Clas- sical culture has influenced the way in which the doctrines, through which Christians have struggled to give explicit propositional and systematic expression to their fundamental faith, have been fashioned. It also liberates, to the same extent, since it helps to distinguish the essential matrix of value-laden imagery from the propositional vehic- les that have been used, by accident of history, to articulate it. Other possible vehicles exist today: the philosophies of Whitehead and of Heidegger are only two of the possible ways in which contemporary 26 See my chapter "The Dimensions of Faith," in Exploring the Logic of Faith, co-authored with Kent Bendall (N.Y.: Association Press, 1962), pp. 43-76. I there discuss the reassuring, judging, challenging, ethical, existential, convic- tional, scientific, historical, attentional, and metaphysical functions of theistic discourse.</page><page sequence="17">THE "QUICK WAY" WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM 343 theologians are struggling to give explicit conceptual form to the historic myths of biblical theism. 27 Whether any of these will suc- ceed in creating a new mainstream of distinctly contemporary the- istic belief is uncertain; the work, however, is well under way and worth careful philosophical attention. The other sense of "origin" we have seen, involves psychological causes of theistic belief rather than its historical roots. Here we are interested in why people today are drawn toward theistic belief (as well as why anyone ever believed theistically) . Some of these causes I have already touched on in my discussion of beginnings. People have values, and some people have the sort of values that are well symbolized by the anthropomorphic images behind all theistic be- lieving. Those images, as Freud noted, give comfort and strength; they also, as Freud did not note, may challenge and stir to generosity or even self-forgetfulness. There is nothing reductionist in acknow- ledging the presence of needs and psychological mechanisms in the background of theistic belief. Psychological mechanisms themselves are entirely neutral, as I suggested above in Part I, to the question of whether there are extra-psychological realities to which (or to Whom) those mechanism are responsive. Theistic belief is, for all that its imagery is directed at a super-human object, a fully human phenomenon; and as a human phenomenon it shares fully in the workings of human psychology. Why some theists consider this fact an embarrassment or a threat is a mystery to me. This is the context, then, in which I wrote the following passage; for which I remain un- repentant: The way in which an idea arises has no particular bearing on its worth. No doubt the genesis in most individuals of the reli- gious doctrines they accept is accounted for... by the psycholo- gical mechanism of suggestion. We normally find our religion, like our politics, implanted early by our families or other close 27 The literature of Whiteheadian theology is extensive. Two of the leading thinkers in this area are John B. Cobb, Jr., A Christian Natural Theology, Based on the Thought of Alfred North Whitehead (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1965) and Schubert O. Ogden, The Reality of God (N.Y.: Harper &amp; Row, 1963). Equally extensive is the literature developing the Heideggerian articulation of Christian faith. A pioneer was Rudolf Bultmann, Kerygma and Myth ed. H.W. Bartsch and trans. R.H. Fuller (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1961), and other important figures are John Macquarrie, An Existentialist Theology (London: SCM Press, 1955) and The Scope of Demythologizing (N.Y.: Harper &amp; Row, 1961). Schubert Ogden has made contributions to this mode of rearticulation as well as to the Whiteheadian mode in Christ Without Myth (N.Y.: Harper &amp; Row, 1961).</page><page sequence="18">344 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION associates, and implanted deep. But the mechanisms of sugges- tion are entirely neutral to the reliability of the beliefs that may take root by their means. The multiplication table is not dis- credited by the fact that it is normally "drilled into us," by rote, in an entirely uncritical way. Nearly everything that we learn as children, fact no less than fiction, travels the (ines- capable) suggestion route. Research with "sleep learning" me- thods represents an attempt by adults to tap once more the re- sources of human suggestibility. How thought comes into the mind, then, is no sure guide to a judgment on whether the thought should be permitted to remain. 28 It is true, of course, that there are abnormal cases in which be- liefs are maintained in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence. And at such times the mechanisms by which such beliefs are gener- ated and sustained are of the utmost interest to therapists. If I be- lieve that I am Napoleon, or that I am in constant danger of being attacked by lurking dangers all around (when no dangers exist), or that I can fly out ten-story buildings by flapping my arms alone - then my well-being demands that my mechanisms of belief be care- fully studied and, if possible, repaired. But even so, it is the insist- ence on believing things that can be clearly shown to be false that marks me down as crazy. To believe strongly that I am Napoleon if I am Napoleon, or that there are surrounding dangers if I am at the battle front, or that I can fly if I have access to an airplane in good condition - these show my rationality. It is the rational be- lievability of my beliefs that needs to be known before the rationality of my propositional attitude can be evaluated. To Job's pestering "comforters," his stubborn insistence on maintaining his belief in his own perceptions of the moral situation seemed irrational and per- verse. That is because they were convinced (on dogmatic grounds) that his beliefs were false. Only God (and Satan, in that story) knew that Job was right and rational. Before theists can be convicted of neuroticism for holding to their images, doctrines, and practices, they must be shown to be clearly wrong-headed, maintaining beliefs that can very probably be shown to be false. There is much presumption, especially among certain social and occupational classes, that theistic beliefs are false, but behind all this presumption is surprisingly little 28 Frederick Ferre, Basic Modern Philosophy of Religion, op. cit., pp. 85-86.

Wald, op. cit.</page><page sequence="19">THE "QUICK WAY" WITH THE WORTH OF THEISM 345 in the way of sensitive understanding of what thoughtful contem- porary theists may be believing. In the end, the continuing causes for theistic belief, despite all the vast changes of circumstances and knowledge over millennia of religious history, must be some sort of experience that permits or demands expression through the evocative myths which constantly renew themselves in ever differing circumstances. I hesitate even to attempt to give these experiences names: the sense of Significant Otherness, the encounter with a Tremendous More, the perception of Meaningful Abidingness, the grateful intuition of Yes - these are halting phrases to say what probably cannot in proper principle be said, since saying is always at a level of conscious awareness that seems shallow by comparison with the deep data that call persons back again and again to the archetypes, however systematized and articulated, that touch us dumbly with God. I do not believe that the only imagery that can do this is the imagery of the theistic religions. Spiritual depths are not exhausted by God-talk. On the contrary, I rejoice in the possibility of many mythic traditions feeding the hungers of religious response to the universe. Perhaps some day, though I doubt it, theistic myths will stir no more responses. Forces more powerful than any I can com- prehend will determine that outcome, not I, nor any band of philo- sophers of religion. But for the forseeable future, as in the historic past, theism will be with us, and no "quick way" will save us from the demand for deep encounter.
