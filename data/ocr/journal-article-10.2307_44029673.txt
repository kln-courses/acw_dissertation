<plain_text><page sequence="1">This essay explores the enactment of the Judaic polemic against idolatry for two important contemporary novel- ists: Cynthia Ozick and Ronald Sukenick. It articulates the polemic that these novels have retrieved in very dif- ferent ways, and addresses some implications of taking Ozick and Sukenick literally. Iconoclastic Commitments: Idolatry and Imagination in Cynthia Qzick and Ronald Sukenick ADAM KATZ In A critical this Jewish essay, logic View, I that argue calls can that the be what rendered "Judaic Lionel polemic accessible Kochan, against in in secular his idolatry" book terms: Beyond constitutes insofar the Graven as it an presents urgent Image: A Jewish View, calls the "Judaic polemic against idolatry" constitutes an urgent critical logic that can be rendered accessible in secular terms: insofar as it presents itself an argument addressed to humanity, as it already does in the Hebrew Bible, and not merely a localized belief, it is always already accessible in such terms. In this case we can, as Kochan, contends, "expound the Biblical argument against idolatry in the Bible s own terms, and also in those elaborated by later thinkers, rabbis and philoso- phers" (1). Here, I examine Ronald Sukenick s Mosaic Man and Cynthia Ozick's The Puttermesser Papers as attempts to take the Judaic polemic against idolatry literally. Both texts put the polemic against idolatry to work in broader epistemological and moral terms, accounting for the relationship between modes of representation and the demand for justice. Furthermore, as innovative works of fiction, these books pro- vide promising test cases for exploring the implications of the second commandment for contemporary cultural critique. Mosaic 38/3 0027-1276-05/1 1301 8$02.00Â©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">114 Mosaic 38/3 (September 2005) Kochan images" singles or "alien out worship": the following the rejection elements of of symbolic the Judaic intermediaries argument against between "graven the images" or "alien worship": the rejection of symbolic intermediaries between the human and the divine (the "imagination") in favour of symbolic action imitating God and re-enacting the human-divine relationship; a privileging of direct, pedagogical, oral transmission of memories over monuments claiming to represent the original event; a proscription of realistic human images, as indirect attempts to fix the reality of God; a concept of time as in flux, always "beginning," rather than divided into dis- crete sections; and, finally, an egalitarian ideal of social justice. According to Kochan, the rejection of idolatry entails a demythologizing approach to the world but not, contra Max Weber, a disenchanting one: its purpose is to open the world to applica- tions of Jewish law, aimed at enacting and renewing creation and revelation. While Kochan touches on some affinities between the Judaic polemic and post- representational thinkers like Jacques Derrida, Leora Batnitzky's study of Franz Rosenzweig, Idolatry and Representation: The Philosophy of Franz Rosenzweig, provides a more helpful way of articulating the polemic with contemporary discussions. Batnitzky distinguishes between two contending definitions of idolatry in Judaism. One, associated with the medieval Jewish philosopher Maimonides and the German Jewish philosopher Hermann Cohen, views idolatry as worship of the wrong object: that is, idolatry involves a mistaken conception (anthropomorphic, in particular) of God. The other, associated with the medieval thinker and poet Judah Ha-Levi and Rosenzweig, sees idolatry simply as worship that has not been commanded by God. From this latter perspective, the whole question of what kinds of images are prohib- ited is misguided: what matters is the terms of sanctification within which the image is addressed. For Rosenzweig, idolatry is a denial of God's freedom to enter human reality however He chooses, and denies the possibility of authentic divine-human encounters (which must always be "figured" in some way - and, moreover, not sim- ply as a compromise with our inability to imagine the unimaginable, but because the encounter is a distinctive event, to which form/content distinctions do not apply). Batnitzky uses the two German words for representation to clarify the distinction: Vorstellung , representation in the sense of establishing a relationship between sign and object (a question of knowledge), is the type of relationship that concerns Maimonides and Cohen. Vertreteny representation in the sense of standing in for something or someone, in an ethical or political sense, meanwhile, is what concerns Rosenzweig. Perhaps the concerns are complementary, though: the interest in representation might stake out a Judaic position as a universalizing, pedagogical one within philosophically and/or aesthetically oriented intellectual communities while the interest in representa- tiveness insists that the experiential structure of the observant Jew provides the ethical and intellectual resources for such confrontations.</page><page sequence="3">Adam Katz 115 The communal, symbolic, and ritual structures that commemorate the Mosaic revelation would in this case enable the rigorous inquiries into the limits of figuration within historically concrete settings that we would demand if the Judaic polemic is to participate effectively within the field of contemporary theory. I do not say that only observant Jews can effectively engage in cultural critique! Rather, a minimal acknowl- edgment of Jewish "precedence" is involved. The "originary hypothesis" of Eric Gans provides us with a way of conceptualiz- ing such "precedence." Gans posits an originary event, at which, driven to the edge of collective self-destruction through the exacerbation of mimetic rivalry into mimetic crisis, the proto -human community emits the originary, ostensive sign of renuncia- tion of the object at the centre of the crisis. For Gans, language, culture, and religion must all be seen as iterations, adaptations, and developments of the resources for increasingly universal modes of (and in response to increasingly complex challenges to) reciprocity implicit in the originary scene. In his Science and Faith: The Anthropology of Revelation Gans situates the Mosaic revelation in relation to originary thinking. Focusing on Moses's initial experience of God on Mount Horeb, Gans notes that, in answer to Moses s request for Gods name, "what God replies to Moses here is not a name, but a declarative sentence, an utter- ance that neither designates a particular center like the ostensive nor attempts, like the imperative, to reconstitute it. The declarative does not refer directly to the world; it constructs a model of the world on the internal scene of representation that all men have inherited from the originary event. The God whose 'name' is a declarative sen- tence makes himself accessible only as spirit" (63). This unfigurable God "no longer offers a concrete focus for desire [...]. God as the source of being answers no to our desire to possess him," but this "refusal guarantees the objectivity of being as well as its accessibility to conceptual thought" (65), allowing for the "freedom to engage in thought beyond the ideological bounds of hierarchical society" (64). While Gans goes on to argue that "the Mosaic revelation [ . . . ] was not in itself sufficient to found a uni- versal religion" (81), pointing to the more universalizing extensions of Christianity and Islam, it is enough for my purposes here to insist that the specifically Mosaic dimension of the monotheistic revelation will be renewable and needed insofar as the maintenance of that revelation depends upon the iteration of its original discovery in communal, ritual, and political modes of signification. Or, in other words, the main- tenance of that revelation depends upon a witness to this decisive iteration and exten- sion of the originary event: a liberation both universal in its egalitarian implications and "strong enough to maintain the solidarity of a community in crisis" (66).</page><page sequence="4">116 Mosaic 38/3 (September 2005) Sukenick which he reads has been the Judaic committed polemic for in decades: terms of "But anti-mimetic it's not till traditions this very in second, writing as to I which he has been committed for decades: "But it's not till this very second, as I write these words, that Ron realizes his dislike for making things up is deeply connected with Jewish rules. The Jewish tradition has a long history of struggle against imitation, Ron remembers. Imitation is not the real thing. It's made up. It leads to the graven image. Which leads to the Golden Calf" (96). In opening his book with a remarkable retelling of Creation and the Fall, at the start of the chapter titled "GENES," Sukenick aligns his writing almost point by point with the attributes of the Judaic polemic enu- merated by Kochan, pushing their implications into the contemporary: In the beginning was the WORD which is unspeakable, unreadable and unintelligible. Beyond human perception. Sublime. Writing not yet language. Dazzle. Pure information. Generative. Algorithmic. Digital, i.e., DNA. Digital Not Analog. Helical. The master code. Original. The first person. Iconoclastic. Always beginning. Then the WORD says. It says language. It says analogy. A metaphor. A picture. RNA. Real. Not Artificial. You Mensch. Personal. Genetic. Chronic.

Graven images finally. Imitation. Fake. Not you. Losing it. In the same world as you. Where's the WORD? What's the story? (9) Mosaic Man is presented in an apparently analogical relation to the Bible, with each chapter mimicking a book or section of the Bible ("Genes," "Ex/ode," "Umbilicus," "Numbers," "Autonomy," "Profits," "Hand Writing on Wall"). Following Sukenick's three stages of the unfolding of modes of signification, the structure of the book sug- gests that we must be always be situated in the "WORD saying," not "in the beginning," since the beginning is "not yet language." There are signs indicating or marked by the beginning, and Sukenick seems to privilege very contemporary signs - information, digital, DNA, etc. - aligning himself with contemporary attempts to retrieve the begin- ning. The present might, in fact, be defined as the struggle to recover the beginning from the emergent. Attempts to retrieve the beginning are necessarily located in the world of proliferating simulacra - inevitably the pictures are replicated. The present is</page><page sequence="5">Adam Katz 117 therefore an ever-renewed struggle against sinful relations with signs, with a directly moral character - the struggle against idolatry is simultaneously the attempt to be a "mensch in the world." And we can see why this might be: the "viral" is associated with psychological attributes that lead one to try to reduce the world (and oneself) to a preconceived and resentful image: "anality," "sublimated," "obsessive," "not you." The struggle to retrieve and register the beginning must therefore be undertaken by enter- ing the realm of simulacra and, to use Batnizkys terms, "risking idolatry": "Images are dangerous for the same reason that they are vital: while images make new realities possible, they constantly run the risk of idolatrously denying the very source of their power: the ever new will of God to move the world toward redemption" (140). Why mimic the Bible? Even more to the point, is that not mere "imitation"? Is taking the Bible literally not a form of idolatry? If Sukenick were simply replicating or parodying the Bible, these charges would have some merit. But, as Kochan writes, the "idolization of the 'letter' is averted in favor of a plurality of meanings, all acknowl- edging their relationship to their origin" (167). As a result of the interaction of written and oral traditions, both asserted to be coeval, the "deification of the text as image is averted; any suggestion of self-subsistence and self-sufficiency is refused; and between text and reader an expository dialogue of indefinite duration comes into existence, engaging all past readers in the way they will also engage their successors" (168). Sukenick incorporates the relation between oral and written into his writing in several ways. First, he makes his chapter titles not merely imitations of the Biblical books, but puns and plausible mispronunciations. Second, he incorporates first per- son discourse situated in the present, including the present of the writing. Third, he introduces different modes of discourse, situating at various locations across what we might think of as a speech/writing continuum: tape recorded conversations, often fragmentary; graffiti-like handwritten symbols; Talmudic-style textual commentaries within the text. Beyond these features, though, I would argue that Sukenick is making an even stronger claim to present his text as simultaneous with the Biblical one, equally closely linked to the beginning. In the "Jerusalem" section of "Autonomy," telling of Sukenick's stay in Israel in the early 1980s, Sukenick writes about his arrival: "Going up to Jerusalem this time he remembers the first time. And all the times. It is hard to remember which time is which. Israel, Jerusalem especially, is a place where every- thing seems to happen at once" (120). On the page before this, meanwhile, Sukenick remembers that "Ron used to take the sherut from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv and back all the time, it's a familiar drive now. But the first time still sticks in his mind. So hes more than surprised when he takes in the occupants of the sherut this morning [...]. The reason Ron is surprised when</page><page sequence="6">118 Mosaic 38/3 (September 2005) he looks around in the sherut is that the passengers are exactly the same as that first time years ago. It's enough to make him suspicious" (119). Now, in what sense is this "literally true" (105) and in fact more literally true than what must obviously be the case, which is that such a remarkable coincidence could not have happened? The sim- plest answer is that it is literally true at the time of the writing - which does not just mean that Sukenick "feels" like it is true. Israel, for Sukenick, is a timeless place, an endless present: "Not only is time in Israel such that everything happens at once but it also happens in the same place. Over and over" ( 140). Rather than a mystifying, this is an iconic representation of Israel, and as such absolutely literalistic as well as scrip- tural. As icon, Israel represents what we might call an extra-mimetic level of experi- ence, the ongoing "coincidence" of regularities emerging out of chaos, "Bible" from "babble" (148); a "writing not yet language" experienced in its becoming-sign. It is, then, on this level of experience that we can consider Sukenick's text con- temporaneous with the biblical one, a different accessing of the same code. And appropriating experience, or events, through what Charles Sanders Peirce called the iconic sign can legitimately be considered literal on the condition that such signs are prior to, and a condition of, the kind of referential, declarative discourse more com- monly considered as "literal." An iconic sign, according to Peirce, represents its object through resemblance to it (Buchler 98-119). It is helpful, of course, to think of the iconic sign in terms of such representations as maps, photographs, and so on. Such signs are characterized by some continuing, even physical, contact with the object - in however mediated a fashion, they touch the object, and to that extent intermingle with it, are part of it. We can, in other words, see the icon as the manifestation, in sig- nification, of "feeling," or the experience of "Firstness": "a state, which is in its entire- ty in every moment of time as long as it endures" (82). In that case, the adequacy of the iconic sign has to be understood less in terms of accuracy (can it stand up to scrutiny by those placed in different contexts, freed from direct contact?) than by whether its deployment or embodiment maintains, preserves, and renews the event it represents by enacting its unfolding. A proper relationship to the iconic sign represents while (by) resisting any encroachment upon that event's originary status. Idolatry is, above all, a sinful, envious, and slavish relationship to the iconic sign: rather than a beginning that is always beginning, the iconic sign has occu- pied one's space of action, has anticipated anything one might consider doing. This at the same time makes it the only conceivable source of power, which one must appease and to which one must gain as exclusive access as possible. The proper, sanctifying response to the iconic sign, meanwhile, is to derive the law from it, which in turn makes history possible: history is nothing more than the record of attempts to resist idolatry and sanctify the beginning.</page><page sequence="7">Adam Katz 119 Sukenick's book is, in fact, structured precisely along these lines. History, in Mosaic Matty right down to the posthuman present, is the struggle between the temp- tations of the "Golden Calf" and the struggle to retrieve the originary code; and, moreover, as indicated by the various "Indiana Jones" -type "sub-plots" throughout the novel, the struggle to liberate the originary code from attempts to instrumental- ize it in the service of the construction of ever more technologically advanced "Calves" and "Golems." Sukenick s own personal history is written within this frame- work: his mistreatment of a young woman in Paris in the 1950s is associated with his "infection" by the "viral" writing of Celine, his childhood fantasies drawn from comic books blind him to the crisis of Europe's Jews and the trap of assimilation. And all of the characters - including the "real life" ones - can most productively be read as icons representing this struggle, as, for example, "Art," who, despite his desire to become a serious writer, represents contemporary America's craving for "shallow materialism" (95), and American Jewish society's craving, in particular. Perhaps most notably, Sukenick reads the condition of the American Jewish writer as representative of the struggle within Judaism (itself exacerbated by the struggle within America between materialism and authenticity), between its two "tracks": "the Mosaic and the Aronian, and they finally separate into two types, the Rabbi and the Mogul. Follow the Rabbi track far enough and you get to the extreme Rabbi, who transcends Jewishness by applying Jewish ideas of morality and justice to everyone. This can be risky and Extreme Rabbis sometimes get crucified. Nobody has to tell us where the Mogul track leads, it leads to Mr. Huge. And Mogul just spells Golem inside out, the uncircumcised son run amok" (248). The second, concluding section of the novel, "Writing" (containing the chapters "Profits" and "Hand Writing on Wall"), is a sustained struggle to wrest the "Mosaic" from the hyper-mimeticism, the idolatry gone mad and high-tech, of contemporary American culture. And the struggle is engaged from within technologies, contrived and stereotyped plots and characters, and idols of that culture, which implicate the author himself: "We forgot to mention Ron's an invention. Silicon and fiber optic, solid state. Bar coded, trade marked, copy written. A nomad now no longer mad. Crazy maybe. He prefers the artificial to real bone and gristle. Prick him he doesn't bleed. Tickle him he doesn't laugh" (257). Sukenick's strategy is to inhabit and then discard (before they can be idolized) figures situated on the boundary between idolatry and the writing not yet language, such as "One of our personalities [ . . . ] a tummler. A comic, a crazy" (203). Sukenick's iconic Jewish stand-up comedian is both complicit and critical, both inside and outside the culture: he tells subversive, inventive tales of origin (for example, of a secret and all-powerful language called "Gnomic" that "far outstrips the subtleties and</page><page sequence="8">120 Mosaic 38/3 (September 2005) complexities of any human language, proceeding by puns and triple or quadruple entendres" [209] ), but at the same time "our boy was after an oscar" (205 - the "oscar" is one of many contemporary forms taken by the Golden Calf in Sukenick's novel), at least as much "Aronian" (punned as A Ronian on occasion) as "Mosaic." In the end, Sukenick insists on a firm line between idolatry and the "writing not yet language." The comic is discarded like all of the other simulated identities and the "real me," the one who has written the book, going by the "secret scriptural name" "RaMSCaM," "is it": Because he's it, his profits don't count. No oscar could make a difference. And besides, he doesn't make a dime. He's never propheted. So what does he get out of this? He is basically a Jew de mot, an author though he declines authority. There are too many things he doesn't know. He's a medium for events he can't comprehend. He's known as a writer but thinks of himself as a teller. Like a bank teller he gives you an account of certain exchanges. He tells your fortune. He keeps the books. He's a scribe prodding the tribe to remember itself against the progressive alzheimer's of history, recording what he hears and sees and the voices in his head. We have met the writer and he is us. (215) This understanding of the writer as a "medium," located, in Hannah Arendt s phrase, "between past and future" (202-13), and from that location remembering and judg- ing, is in perfect conformity with the Jewish polemic against idolatry Kochan has articulated. Sukenick's alliance with the polemic against idolatry leads him to trans- form what could be considered a familiar postmodern tactic of self-reflexivity (lead- ing to the undecidability of the idolatrous nature of the sign) into an unequivocal claim for the sign's originary status: self-reflexivity is the articulation of that instant when the flow of experience has not yet quite become sign, intensifying the freedom and responsibility associated with that moment when things are still open. Sukenick articulates this mediumistic space through a progressive "becoming invisible" that is played out on various levels throughout the novel. In the "Ghost Ghetto" section of "Autonomy," Sukenick returns to Venice as an elderly, obscure, invisible writer. The "scarlet of his invisibility [ . . . ] has become an emblem of holdout against an idolatrous, icon conned, oscar crazed hollywooden world." Even more: "his invisibility, in fact, is simply an extension of his normal situation - the consequence of obscure critical esteem for his literary work, buried by myopic hype for his more journalistic, if ostensibly profitable, output as a writer - an invisibility recently more painful as a result of deaths, divorce and geographical circumstance, by the removal, in short, of all those who had been closest" (160). Following the "eddy of incident," Sukenick aimlessly wanders around Venice, an</page><page sequence="9">Adam Katz 121 aimless, circular city, a "self-referential" (169) city, "a city so full of thereness his pres- ence isn't necessary." He finds the old Jewish ghetto, "the first in the world" (164), and keeps circling around, finding himself unable to exist. In the course of his wanderings, he encounters a young couple, who seem vaguely familiar, to whom he is strangely drawn, and whose acquaintance he comes to make. The young man, a writer, it turns out, is caught in the same struggle between the "visible, ongoing decay of the world" and the invisible, the "otherworldly" (162) that has characterized Ron's own life and work, a struggle he is currently re-engaging in Venice, a city that is itself an icon of this tension. He remembers that on his first trip to Venice, he had a vision; "he literally saw himself as a successful author twenty years in the future," and "in remembering who he was going to be, he begins to remember who he is" (175). It finally emerges that the young man is himself, twenty years earlier, which Sukenick realizes when the young man exclaims to his wife, while looking at Sukenick, "I just dreamed I saw myself twenty years from now." At this point, Having looked at my reflection in his eyes for that instant, I at last understand without innocence. That I myself am it, for him, at this moment as twenty years before, that ghost and warn- ing of another world I once merely intuited. Ecco! Blinded by this vision, I finally see my own invisibility, as he, miraculously, fades and dis- appears into passing time. (180) This revelation of a timelessness in time, a revelation that is both effect and retroac- tive cause of previous revelations, and of the historical and semiotic conditions of such a vision, this seeing of one s own invisibility while blinded, points, I believe, to only one conclusion regarding the meaning of invisibility in Sukenick's text: it is a becoming sign, oneself, of the originary event commemorated, re-enacted, and re- begun with the sign. Only a sign, and an iconic sign in particular, whose very materi- ality is what enables it to signify the invisible, can be seen in its invisibility. And this becoming sign of the writing not yet language is an imitation of the Biblical God, here conceived as intelligence situated between randomness and code. A prerequisite of situating oneself thusly, though, seems to be identifying oneself with the "Extreme Rabbi," who steps outside of Judaism into the universal. Sukenick makes a similar gesture near the opening of the novel: "Personally, being Jewish is just an advanced case of being human, and being human may be a terminal disease that's run its course. Personally, maybe we're just beings, forget human, beings among other</page><page sequence="10">1 22 Mosaic 38/3 (September 2005) beings, some hairy, some furry, some feathery, some leathery, and some who possibly will arrive from other sectors of the universe" (16). The Mosaic as icon does not depend, then, on any explicit affiliation with the Jewish people. While Mosaic Man focuses very carefully on anti-Semitism as a particularly virulent consequence of idol- atrous tendencies, most forms of Jewish community are eschewed and denounced, explicitly or implicitly: the "aronian" tendency leading to "shallow materialism" seems to be the prevalent one in American Jewish culture, and the "intricate soft irony" of the Arab-Israeli writer Anton Shammas seems to Ron "so much more Jewish than the aggressive assertivenes s of the Israelis" (149), to take just a couple of examples. I emphasize that I do not point this out as a criticism of Sukenick, but rather, first, to note the rigour of his understanding of Judaism as a mode of knowledge (his writing is utterly free of nostalgia for more compact and homogenous forms of Jewish com- munity) and, second, to set up a pertinent point of contrast with Cynthia Ozick's articulation of the Judaic polemic. Ozick's acteristics essay, of "Literature idolatry - as that Idol: an Harold idol can Bloom," lead only enumerates to itself and "four has essential no meaning char- acteristics of idolatry - that an idol can lead only to itself and has no meaning other than itself; that an idol always has an ideal precursor on which to model its form; that an idol can have no connection to human deed and human history-mak- ing; that an idol crushes pity" (191). Like Kochan and Sukenick, Ozick associates the Judaic struggle against idolatry with the human capacity for beginning, which makes it impossible and blasphemous to try to capture definitively either God's or the human image: "Scripture tells us that the human being is made in the image of God, and since we do not know how to adumbrate God, we remain as free, as unpre- dictable, as unfated in our aspirations as quicksilver" (189). Ozick pushes the Judaic polemic to its anti-literary and anti-imagination conclusions, opening her essay by declaring the "Jewish writer" to be an "oxymoron" (178), and later on asserting: "no Jew may be an idolator or idol-maker; poems are the products of 'strong imagina- tions/ and poets are dangerously strong imaginers, vampirishly living on the blood of earlier imaginers, from Moloch to Moloch; no Jew ought to be a poet" (193). And in contrast to idolatry, Ozick also posits a return to shared beginnings, equally available to all: "The mainstream Jewish sense does not regard a hope to recapture the strength, unmediated, of Abraham and Moses as a condemnation [...]. [I]t is only through such recapture and emulation of the precursor's stance, unrevised, that life can be nourished, that the gift of the creator can be received, praised, fulfilled [...]. There is no competition with the text, no power struggle with the original, no envy of the Creator. The aim, instead, is to reproduce a purely transmitted inheritance, free of</page><page sequence="11">Adam Katz 123 substitution or incarnation" (195). Ozick raises the stakes even higher by focusing not simply on idolatry, which can be charitably seen as an error or momentary devi- ation, but on idol-making: "Idol -making: I posit this not figuratively, not metaphor- ically, not what Bloom might call "metaleptically," but literally. And I choose for Bloom the more drastic term "idol-maker" over "idolator" because the idolator, having no self-consciousness, is a kind of innocent conformist. The idol-maker, by contrast, has the highest self- consciousness of all, and should be prepared philo- sophically, conscientiously, for the consequences of the pervasive idolatry in which he has, in effect, a vested interest" (187-88). Ozick's own writing might be taken as a kind of anti-literature, then, aimed at detecting and correcting the imagination's tendency to strive to supplant the original. And this assumption, in fact, provides a very good guide for making sense of The Puttermesser Papers. (See Timothy Parrish for another reading of Ozick's novel in terms of her iconoclastic commitments, and for a discussion of Ozick's own invest- ment in the modes of idolatry she "risks" in the book's middle chapters.) I begin by discussing one of the middle three chapters (each of which addresses, rather pro- grammatically, a specific type of idolatry: civic idealism, aesthetic idealism, ethnic idealism), "Puttermesser and Xanthippe." Then I turn to a discussion of the opening chapter, "Puttermesser: Her Work History, Her Ancestry, Her Afterlife," and the con- cluding chapter, "Puttermesser in Paradise," suggesting that these chapters provide a rather surprising way to frame the book's polemic. Ruth Puttermesser is a liberal New Yorker, faithful to the philosophical and literary classics of Western culture, a believer in the virtues of the imagination, and passionately committed to the civic idealism here associated with the first generation of American- born children of Jewish immigrants. She is a thoroughly (and undoubtedly deliberately) "flat" character: her thoughts and emotions are described in mostly neutral terms, with explicit narratorial judgments introduced occasionally. To put it directly, Puttermesser is a foil, a "bad example," from start to finish - in Brechtian fashion, we are meant to study Puttermesser, not identify with her. Each chapter in the novel stands alone - no references are made in the later chapters to the earlier ones, there is no suggestion that Puttermesser "grows," or learns from her mistakes. We could account for this by not- ing that the chapters were originally published separately as stories, and at some dis- tance from each other. There is a more important point, though: like the characters in the Bible, or in Rabbinical tales, Puttermesser is an allegorical, stock character. We are not to be distracted from the pedagogical intent of the stories. Early in "Puttermesser and Xanthippe," we see Puttermesser displaced from her civil service job by opportunistic bureaucrats, and her initial attempts to reverse this</page><page sequence="12">124 Mosaic 38/3 (September 2005) injustice. We are told that Puttermesser "imagined daughters. It was self-love: all these daughters were Puttermesser as a child" (36). Following the death of Puttermesser's imagined daughter, Puttermesser sees a naked girl lying in her bed. Puttermesser has created a Golem, whom she then proceeds to bring to life. Already, the tension between Puttermesser's use of her imagination to usurp the prerogative of the Creator and the certainty that her sovereignty over her creation is illusory is evident: "The girl did not resemble Puttermesser at all; she was certainly not one of the imaginary daughters" (37). The fantasy materialized in the Golem - who, rejecting Puttermesser's preferred name, Leah, insists on calling herself Xanthippe, after Socrates's "shrewish" wife - is complex. First of all, the story invites a feminist reading, on several levels: a woman appropriates extraordinary powers previously reserved for male rabbis, and Xanthippe helps Puttermesser win election to the mayoralty (on the "Independents for Socratic and Prophetic Idealism" ticket) and then transform the city into a civic paradise. Such a reading is misleading, though: the sinfulness and ultimately devas- tating consequences of the production of the Golem are identical, regardless of sex; Puttermesser insists on treating Xanthippe as a domestic servant, resisting her grow- ing independence; and Xanthippe's destruction and Puttermesser's downfall comes from Xanthippe's discovery of desire, leading to unrestrained sexual indulgence. This is not to say that the story is anti-feminist - the point is that no grievance (whether it be misogyny or Puttermesser's unjust termination) justifies the turn to idolatry. Even more, insofar as the idol attacked here is Puttermesser's naÃ¯ve civic ide- alism, the belief that "good government" as a worldly image of paradise can be realized here on earth, the idol is causally related to (and a disguise for) such Utopian desires. Puttermesser "deactivates" Xanthippe and leaves her "body" in the attic of Gracie Mansion, just as the "Great Rabbi Judah Loew undid the Golem of Prague in the attic of the Altneuschul" ( 100). It might appear that Puttermesser has learned her lesson but the implicit contrast with Judah Lowe reminds us that the Prague Golem was deliber- ately created to protect the Jewish community from destruction, while Puttermesser's was created as an unconscious manifestation of egoistic and alien fantasies. There is something cruel, on the face of it, about Ozick's treatment of Putter- messer. Puttermesser seems to learn nothing, to simply repeat the same mistakes over and over, and to be completely responsible for those mistakes, with no extenuation. Her brutal murder in the concluding chapter seems to reinforce this thoroughly judg- mental presentation. At a certain point one has to ask: what, exactly, is wrong with Puttermesser? Ozick does answer this question, and in a way that is as rigorous as her sustained denunciation and therefore pretty close to unbearable: after all, "The</page><page sequence="13">Adam Katz 125 Second Commandment runs against the grain of our social nature, indeed against human imagination. To observe it is improbable, perhaps impossible; perhaps it has never been, and never will be, wholly observed [...]. [I] t is uniquely antithetical to the practices and premises of the pre- Judaic and non-Judaic world" (198). The opening chapter, "Puttermesser: Her Work History, Her Ancestry, Her Afterlife," is apparently concerned with placing Puttermesser as an American Jew, but does not allow us to place Puttermesser in familiar categories. She "had a Jewish face and a modicum of American distrust of it" (4), while at the same time despising the all-American "Breck girl" look which would presumably be the standard of compari- son. After law school she joins a "blueblood Wall Street firm" (6), into which the Jewish lawyers, with a couple of exceptions, futilely strive to assimilate. Puttermesser, though, leaves because they treated her "like a fellow- aristocrat" (7). Oddly, though, she "could have come from anywhere," with an impeccable New England heritage and accent (but then she remembers Dreyfus). Her farewell dinner, though, reveals that they see her as a Jew: "They explored the rites of her tribe. She had not known she was strange to them" (8). Seemingly gratuitous and blatantly "unrealistic" details like her having a younger sister who "married an Indian, a Parsee chemist, and [had] gone to live in Calcutta" (3) prevent Puttermesser from coalescing as a character. At this point, the narrator interrupts (this first chapter has a meta-fictional quality absent from the rest of the book): she tells us what would happen "if this were an opti- mistic portrait" (12), and then tells us what will really happen, eliminating all suspense from the story of Puttermesser s life. Puttermesser will never change in any significant way: "The difficulty with Puttermesser is that she is loyal to certain environments." This enigmatic comment is followed by a description of Puttermesser 's fantasy of "gan eydn," Hebrew for Paradise, "a term and notion handed on from her great-uncle Zindel, a former shammes in a shul that had been torn down" (12). Her fantasy is essentially a replication of her everyday pleasures, only without interferences or unpleasant conse- quences. From here until the end of the chapter, the narrative becomes extremely unsta- ble, and in such a way as to destabilize the rest of the book. We are told that Puttermesser has bi-weekly Hebrew lessons with her Uncle Zindel, and their relation- ship is portrayed in some detail. Then, the narrator once again breaks in abruptly: Stop. Stop, stop! Puttermesser 's biographer, stop. Disengage, please. Though it is true that biographies are invented, not recorded, here you invent too much. A symbol is allowed, but not a whole scene: do not accommodate too obsequiously to Puttermesser 's romance. Having not much imagination, she is literal with what she has. Uncle Zindel lies under the earth of Staten Island. Puttermesser has never had a conversation with him; he died four</page><page sequence="14">126 Mosaic 38/3 (September 2005) years before her birth. He is all legend: Zindel the stingy, who even in gan eydn rather than eat will store apples until they rot. Zindel the Unripe. Why must Puttermesser fall into so poignant a fever over the cracked phrases of a shammes of a torn-down shul? (The shul was not torn down, neither was it abandoned. It disintegrated. . . ) (16-17) Why does Puttermesser require such a fantasy, involving both a benevolent uncle who transmits his "Yiddishkeit" to her, along with the pathos of the abandonment of the tradition? "Puttermesser must claim an ancestor. She demands connection - surely a Jew must own a past." Both her parents were American born, and "her father is near- ly a Yankee"! In other words, "America is a blank," and all ties to the Old World have been cut off. "Of the world that was, there is only this single grain of memory: that once an old man, Puttermesser 's mother's uncle, kept his pants up with a rope belt, was called Zindel [...]. To him Puttermesser clings" (17). But: "Puttermesser does not remember Uncle Zindel; Puttermesser's mother does not remember him. A name in the dead grandmother's mouth. Her parents have no ancestry" (18). Now, if Puttermesser is not in fact clinging to "this single grain of memory," those could not have been her fantasies of her time with Zindel that we have been introduced to. If her "biographer" is "accommodating Puttermesser's romance" she is doing so in a rather indirect way, by projecting back into Puttermesser's actual life a fantasy Puttermesser could conceivably have had if she had remembered Uncle Zindel. But then we have to revise the "narrative conscience's" (as I will refer to the voice chiding the "biographer") explanation of Puttermesser's fantasy: that is, she is not claiming an ancestor, even in an illusory way. Even more - her fantasy of gan eydn could not have been real either, because she had learned that term from Uncle Zindel. Her biographer, apparently, is desperate to find some thread to connect Puttermesser to a past from which she is so alienated that she does not even experience her alien- ation. In fact, for Puttermesser, the old immigrant Jewish East Side seems to be enough: in the old photographs, she "sees the teeming" (17). And, so, why is it a defect in Puttermesser that "beyond and behind" this teem- ing, "something more is teeming" (18)? Puttermesser "cannot see" this world that has been lost - but so what? And why does the narrative conscience object to the biogra- pher's attempt to restore this continuity - even to the extent of (as we find out later) constructing a "blank America" on which to project such fantasies? "The scene with Uncle Zindel did not occur. It could not occur because, though Puttermesser dares to posit her ancestry, we may not. Puttermesser is not to be examined as an artifact but as an essence. Who made her? No one cares. Puttermesser is henceforth to be pre- sented as given. Put her back into Receipts and Disbursements, among office Jews and</page><page sequence="15">Adam Katz 127 patronage collectors [...]. Hey! Puttermesser 's biographer! What will you do with her now?" (18-19). If Puttermesser "dares to posit her ancestry," it must be without realiz- ing that she is doing so. On some level, she registers the past from which she is so alien- ated that she does not realize she is alienated from it - the biographer is only invent- ing, then, to record an absence that is, somehow, there. The only conclusion we can draw, I believe, is that a very profound essentialism - or, perhaps, orthodoxy is more precise - is being asserted here: we are asked to accept the justice of Puttermesser 's "punishment" even while we are given to understand that her fundamental, essential sinfulness (her failure to retrieve and sustain the thread of tradition) comes through absolutely no fault of her own. And Ozick is also indicating what we need to accept in order to accept this: that as long as there is the faintest sign of those threads, even mem- ories of having lost memories, we are obliged to sense and pursue them. And if we are thus obliged, it must be because we are somehow framed for this obligation. The narrative conscience is proven right because, as we are told in the closing chapter, "Puttermesser in Paradise," the profile of her father constructed in the open- ing chapter is false. Here, in words that we are told Puttermesser typed into her com- puter moments before her death, is given, verbatim, that (invented) description of her father: "My father is nearly a Yankee [...]. Providence, Rhode Island, beats richly in my veins" (217). "Pure" American and "pure" (ethnic) Jew turn out to be interde- pendent fantasies. But the instability of that opening chapter is further aggravated - now, we are led to believe that the entire opening chapter has been constructed around "improbables" that Puttermesser, or the "genie" in the computer, had been typing near the end of her life - her fantasies of Paradise (not, here, gan edyn ), show up on the computer as well - and turn out to be equally false. The effect is to create a centre of gravity at the instant before death toward which all discourse seems to be rushing and which, in turn, accounts for both the reality of the world and its infinitely flexible, "quicksilver" quality: "It happens that in the several seconds before we die the well of the ribs opens, and a crystal pebble is thrown in; then there is a distant tiny splash, no more than the chirp of a droplet. This seeming pebble is the earthly equal of what astrophysicists call a Black Hole - a dead sun that has collapsed into itself, shrinking from density to deeper density, until it is smaller than the period at the end of this sentence. Until it is less than infinitesimal." And when this pebble has "flown" to the "bottom of this bottomlessness [...] there was PARDES" (213), or Paradise. After the elderly Puttermesser is murdered and raped (in that order) by an intruder, she goes to PARDES. Ozick's PARDES is a "puzzling present" (222), in which every- thing that ever existed exists - and its opposite - and its opposite, because the "secret meaning of Paradise is that it too is hell" (234).</page><page sequence="16">128 Mosaic 38/3 (September 2005 ) The suggestion that the "pebble" that is "dropped" "in the several seconds before we die" means that the pebble is connected, however distantly, to PARDES. If we reverse that, PARDES is already present, or at least its signs and indications are pres- ent, in those "several seconds." But if such signs and indications are present in those several seconds, signs and indications of the possibility of those several seconds must be present in the previous several seconds. And so on. In which case, "PARDES," as an "acronym for a way of understanding" (220), from the "simplest," most obvious level of meaning, to the "secret meaning" (221), is always present, in all signs. In other words, the "sod," or secret level of meaning of The Puttermesser Papers is that the entire book is situated on the point at which "the earthly and the heavenly are so interlocked that one passes willy-nilly ; and whether speaking or silent , from one to the otheryy (215), the point at which signs are articulated so as to indicate that fleeting beginning - or to construct an idolatrous network of self-referential signs, closing off that beginning, perhaps forever. If, as the depiction of Puttermesser s PARDES suggests, she is damned, it is because she never seized that infinitesimal instant, that "always beginning," where we are genuinely in God's image, and made it the generator of her actions. The fact that she could only have done so by sensing the trace of a trace of memories to which she never had genuine access is the most powerful way of indicating everything that is both unnatural and uncompromisingly demanding in the rejection of idols. And the unreasonably uncompromising stance taken by the book's narrator, and her "cruelty" and arbitrariness towards Puttermesser, is further revealed as an exercise in the "quicksilver" freedom and the consequent responsibility that Puttermesser has failed to take on: giving even the semblance of independent "life" to a character in a novel is a capitulation to idolatry. Sukenick's put us on origin a path is more towards plural its retrieval than Ozick's, is correspondingly and the range of more signs expansive which might and put us on a path towards its retrieval is correspondingly more expansive and diverse. Rather than fashionably privilege his account, though, I would recommend embracing both as opposing ends of a continuum which must be grasped as a whole. Returning to Batnitzky 's examination of opposing articulations of the Judaic polemic, perhaps we should look for different ways of articulating theoretical perplexities (Maimonides) and experiential structures (Rosenzweig). Sukenick transforms his perplexity (his location in between "writing not yet language" and simulacra) into a generative experiential structure: the Judaic polemic becomes a strategy for aligning self-reflexivity with truth within contemporary circuits of signification. Ozick's found- ing perplexity (the Jewish writer who can not exist - a "kind of sphinx or gryphon"</page><page sequence="17">Adam Katz 129 ["Literature" 198] - advancing an impossible polemic) becomes a site of judgment of the community s willingness to bear the originary experiential structure. Neither position can cancel the other and each signifies - with its own political valence - the inexhaustible generativity of the origin and the paradox of the Judaic polemic itself, whose refutation of any a priori claim of access to the divine must be testified to in the singular.
