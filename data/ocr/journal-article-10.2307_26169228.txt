Thomas General Motors Company Richard A. Wiik Takata Jacqueline E. Brown General Motors Company ABSTRACT General Motors and the Takata Corporation have worked together to bring to production a new, industry first technology called the Front Center Airbag which is being implemented on General Motors' 2013 Midsize Crossover Vehicles. This paper reviews field data, describes the hardware, and presents occupant test data to demonstrate in-position performance in far side impacts. The Front Center Airbag is an airbag that mounts to the inboard side of the driver front seat. It has a tubular cushion structure, and it deploys between the front seating positions in far side impacts, near side impacts and rollovers, with the cushion positioning itself adjacent the driver occupant's head and torso. This paper includes pictures of the technology along with a basic description of the design. In-position occupant performance is also described and illustrated with several examples. Single occupant and two front occupant far side impact test data are included, both with and without the airbag present. Resulting performance differences are discussed leading to the following test observations: a) In a far side impact with a single driver occupant present, the deployed airbag functions as a restraint to help keep the occupant away from the intruded passenger compartment structure. b) When two occupants are present, the deployed airbag functions as a cushion between the front occupants. In addition, field data from the Fatal Analysis Reporting System and National Automotive Sampling System - Crashworthiness Data System are initially presented to illustrate the challenges that this technology attempts to address.

This section presents the single driver Figure 4. Injured Belted Front Outboard Passenger occupant data. Body Regions in Far Side Impacts - NASS-CDS 1999 to As shown in Figure 6, the FARS database study revealed 2009, 1999 model year and newer vehicles that 58% of the front outboard occupant fatalities and 73% ofthe driver fatalities in far side impacts were to a single driver occupant. The NASS-CDS data analysis identified the head, thorax, and arm regions of the belted driver and front outboard passenger as the body areas most frequently injured in far side impacts. These three body regions were also found to be the most frequently injured regions in Gabler et al (2005). [1] The following figure illustrates occupant kinematics that may have been involved in some of these injuries: The single far side occupant in the top left view can be Figure 6.

Figure 9 shows a picture of the vehicle interior. injury sources were modified to reflect what was thought to have happened. For example, in 29 of the cases that the GM team coded as involving center console related injuries, the NASS-CDS coding is shown as the transmission lever even though the text in most of these cases indicates the center console as the injury source. Those cases with observed center console loading and no observed transmission lever contact in the pictures were changed to the center console category. Figures 7 and 8 illustrate two such cases.

Field Data for Two Front OccupantsEvery time a right front passenger is present, there is also a driver, thus two front occupants can be present in far side impacts with a high level of frequency. 42% of the far side fatalities studied were to a front occupant who had a second adjacent occupant present, as is shown by summing the two far side impact conditions in Figure 13 where two occupants were present.

As illustrated in Figures 14 and 15, in both far side impact scenarios with an adjacent occupant present, a portion of the far side occupant head injuries were attributed to contact with the adjacent occupant. Note that GM classified the injury source for several cases as “unknown,” because of the specifics surrounding these cases. Also, with a second occupant present, the primary source of head injury is no longer contact with a portion of the passenger perimeter, as it is for the single driver occupant. Figure 12. Sources of Torso Injury to Single Belted Driver Occupants Front occupant belted fatalities in non-rollover far side impacts, 1999 to 2009, 1999 model year and newer vehicles The primary sources of injury in a far side crash are the items adjacent the occupant, including the center console and the adjacent seat. The inset picture shows that the occupant's torso can move into the region of the vehicle occupied by these components. Figures 7 and 8, presented earlier, illustrate two cases Figure 14.

Safety / Volume 1, Issue 2(August 2013) 357 No pictures from example cases with two front occupants are provided, as the cases with two occupants tend to look similar to the cases with a single occupant, absent some of the damage to intruded interior surfaces potentially caused by the far side occupant in the single occupant cases. This field data analysis illustrates the potential for an occupant to be injured in a far side impact. The Front Center Airbag described in the section that follows attempts to address some of the far side impact injury potential observed. Figure 15.

In some cases it is difficult to determine which object adjacent the torso caused the injury, as it could have been some combination of the center console, adjacent occupant, and adjacent seat.

[4] The Front Center Future efforts are aimed at reducing the size and mass. Airbag's shape and features have been configured to minimize the potential for localized loading. The Front Center Airbag cushion is also sealed with a silicone layer on the fabric and silicone beads at the sew lines, similar to a roof-rail side impact airbag, so that it can hold inflator gas at higher pressures during the later occupant loading times in a far side crash and for longer duration rollover events. Figure 20. The Cushion Design The cushion is a unique shape when compared to other airbags. As shown in Figure 20, the cushion has a tubular structure that has a “figure 8” shape. A tube filled with pressurized gas becomes very rigid and is difficult to bend, so Figure 21. The Diffuser the tubular structure contributes to the cushion's lateral stiffness. Two tethers are used in the cushion design to help curve it A diffuser is included inside the cushion to direct the toward the driver occupant. An external tether routes from the majority of the gas upward and a portion of the gas forward top of the cushion to its seat anchoring location. A second, around the lower tubular region via a small round vent hole, lower tether routes fore-aft on the cushion and passes through as illustrated in Figure 21. two slots in the unfilled lower region. Both tethers are shorter in length than the surrounding cushion panels and, as a result, curve the cushion toward the occupant when the cushion is under pressure. The thickness of filled cushion near the occupant's head is greater than it is adjacent the occupant's torso. Inflated coverage is positioned adjacent the occupant's head to provide cushioning for this body region. The upper tether also acts as a membrane, similar to a drum cover, over the un- inflated upper cushion regions that must be present to reduce stress concentrations and make the design pressure / volume balanced.

Front Center Airbag technology development was also conducted in side impact rigid body sled tests containing a DEFINITIONS/ABBREVIATIONS seatbelted ATD in the driver seat, using SNCAP and IIHS test pulses, with the buck oriented at a 15 degree angle to AIS - Abbreviated Injury Scale perpendicular for the SNCAP condition and in a ATD - Anthropomorphic Test Device perpendicular orientation for the IIHS condition. ATD performance goals were met in these conditions. FARS - Fatality Analysis Reporting System In addition, the Front Center Airbag was evaluated in the FMVSS - Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard existing North American regulatory and consumer metric test HIC - Head Injury Criteria conditions that contain near side seated ATDs. The Front IARV - Injury Assessment Reference Value Center airbag was judged to have no effect on the test results, except that it helped limit the magnitude of the driver kph - Kilometers per hour occupant's rebound kinematics. mm - Millimeters SUMMARY/CONCLUSIONS mph - Miles per hourNASS-CDS - National Automotive Sampling System - Based on a field data analysis, approximately 11 percent Crashworthiness Data System of the non-rollover fatalities and 29 percent of the side impact NHTSA - National Highway Traffic Safety Administration fatalities to belted front occupants occur in far side impacts. The head, torso, and arms are the predominant body regions nm - Newton Meter that are injured in these crashes. In far side impacts with a RFCR - Rear Facing Child Restraint single belted front occupant, head injuries are primarily TWG - (Side Impact Out-of-Position Injury) Technical Work caused by the intruded interior, and torso injuries are Group primarily caused by the adjacent center console and seat. In far side impacts with adjacent front occupants, the other occupant may be a source of injury in some cases.
