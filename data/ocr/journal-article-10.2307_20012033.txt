<plain_text><page sequence="1">D. DIEKS PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION ABSTRACT. Two proposals for a physicalistic analysis of causation - the so-called transference model and an account given by J. L. Mackie - are examined and found wanting on the score of physical objectivity. This shortcoming can be remedied, but it is further argued that both proposals embody a too restricted conception of what a physicalistic analysis of causation should be. A more general program is proposed. There has been some discussion lately concerning the relative merits of various types of physicalistic and non-physicalistic analyses of causa? tion.1 The distinction is broadly between approaches in which an attempt is made to provide an account of causation in terms of physical descriptions of events and states of affairs, i.e., descriptions according to our best physical theories, and approaches which appeal to "an? thropomorphic" standards. The accounts from the latter category are usually variations on the theme that the notions of manipulation and human intervention are crucial for an understanding of causation. On the other hand, the proponents of physicalistic accounts customarily claim to be able to give an objective analysis of causation and its direction by making use of objective physical properties; in this way, they maintain, causation obtains its rightful place as a category of physical ontology and does not need to be relegated to the realms of psychology or anthropology. In this article I shall examine two concrete proposals for physicalistic analyses which have been brought forward in the literature - the so-called transference model and an account given by J. L. Mackie. It will turn out that both proposals are wanting: they do not satisfy their own standard of physical objectivity. The two accounts can perhaps be suitably modified in order that they do satisfy that standard. I shall argue, however, that both accounts embody a rather narrow conception of what a physicalistic analysis of causation should be, and that their possible modifications suggest a wider notion of physicalistic analysis. According to this wider notion human patterns of use of causal concepts are taken as the basis of the account so that there is a certain rapprochement with the non-physicalistic approaches. Nevertheless, the objective physical status of the analysis is not affected. Erkenntnis 25 (1986) 85-110. ? 1986 by D. Reidel Publishing Company.</page><page sequence="2">86 D. DIEKS 1. The first candidate for a physicalistic analysis to be considered here is the so-called transference model of causation.2 In this model the causal bond is identified with the transfer of physical quantities like energy and momentum; the direction of causation is identified with the direction of flow of these physical quantities. Much stress is placed by the pro? ponents of the transference model on the "ontic" status of the analysis (as opposed to the "nomic" status of approaches which make essential use of physical laws). The idea is that energy and momentum are there as objective components of the world, and retain their identity through physical processes; the flow of energy and momentum is likened to the motion of physical objects. There is therefore not only numerical equality of energy and momentum before and after physical interaction, but it is the same energy that is present. According to this point of view the question of the existence of energy and momentum should be well distinguished from the question which physical laws hold with respect to them. Aronson (1982), for instance, stresses that we could rightfully speak about a flow of energy and momentum even if there were no conservation laws pertaining to these quantities. The transference model is thus not meant to be equivalent with a strictly nomological view of causation. On such a nomological view cause and effect are state descriptions (at different times) which are connected by physical laws. But, as has been objected many times against such an account, this does not make it clear why we think of the cause-effect relation as asymmetrical. If a state description S(tx) of an isolated physical system at time ii leads, together with the deterministic laws of classical physics, to a description S(t2) at time t2, it is also true that S(t2) leads us back to S(tx). Why should we consider S(tx) as the cause of S(t2), and not S(t2) as the cause of S(ii)? Apparently the asymmetry in the treatment of S(tx) and S(t2) could only be justified on physical grounds if there were some objective physical features which would make it possible to discriminate between the two state descrip? tions. But such a distinction cannot be made in an obvious way on the basis of the fundamental laws of classical physics alone. In order to appreciate this it is important to note that the laws, being time reversal invariant, do not single out events of a "cause-type" which would always occur earlier than events of an "effect-type". Any process which is nomologically possible has a counterpart that is just as possible and</page><page sequence="3">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 87 that develops in a time order which is exactly opposite to the one of the original process. The laws by themselves are therefore not sufficient to establish a physically objective order of time which could be used to discriminate S(tx) from S(t2) (in other words, it is not possible to define an objective earlier-later relation on the basis of physical laws alone). Now every particular situation requires for its theoretical description and explanation the specification of boundary and initial conditions besides the specification of the appropriate physical laws. Any actual asymmetry must therefore be related to the prevalent boundary and initial conditions. The transference analysis can be regarded as representing one way of making use of this fact: although there is the nomological possibility of a flow of energy-momentum both one way and the other, in any actual case the boundary conditions determine one particular direction of the flow. The transference model of causation consequently seems to succeed in attributing a definite direction to every physical process (viz., the direction of energy-momentum flow in that particular process). Of course, this alone does not automatically qualify the model as an adequate physicalistic account of causation. In order to judge whether or not the transference model is adequate in this respect we also have to investigate the relation between the direction of energy-momentum flow and the direction of causation in those cases where we are able to unambiguously assign the latter direction. However, before embarking on that question I want to investigate two preliminary issues: first whether it is permitted to speak about energy and momentum as a kind of substance which retains its identity through time and further to what extent the transference model really succeeds in assigning an objective physical direction to every process. 2. In his (1982) Aronson writes: We often find in the physical sciences that there are certain fundamental quantities which are conserved throughout a physical interaction_Once such quantities are ascribed to objects an 'accounting' problem arises when bodies interact in that we wish to know what happens to them before, during and after interaction takes place. For the purposes of illustration, consider the following experiment. It consists of two spheres, a and b, one moving and the other at rest at time!. At time2, a makes contact with b, comes to a halt while b moves off at time3. In other words, a lost all of its momentum in this sequence of events while b gained momentum. The obvious answer to the questions 'What happened</page><page sequence="4">88 D. DIEKS to a's momentum?' and 'How did b acquire its momentum?' is that it was transferred from a. This means that, barring friction, the momentum b has at time3, is exactly the same momentum a had at time! .... This makes sense of how it is that the causal relation is stronger than the mere correlation of events. In the case of a causing b to move, fr's momentum at time t3 is the same as a's at time!. Denying this would lead to quite a mystery, for then we would have to say that somehow a lost all of its momentum at time2 and b acquired the exact same amount at that very moment. It would be more natural to regard a's loss and fr's gain as stages of a single process of transference of one and the same quantity rather than, ? la Hume, separate and distinct events. Besides, we have yet another advantage in retaining the identity of quantities here, for not only do we explain why b moved at all but we have also explained why it moved when and where it did, i.e., b moved at time2 because, at time2, a's momentum was transferred to b in a single instance. So, it is this process of transference which makes the sequence causal vis a vis the constant conjunction of events. Natural as the view advocated in the above quotation may seem, it is at variance with the treatment given by modern physics of processes of "energy and momentum exchange". Actually, the idea that energy and momentum possess an identity of their own which is retained throughout physical interactions is already foreign to classical physics. In the classical theories energy and momentum are introduced as quantities which obey global conservation laws, so that it is possible to assert that before and after physical interactions the total amount of these quantities is the same. There is no need to regard energy and momentum as a kind of substance which is transferred, while retaining its identity, from the particles and fields before the interaction to those after the interaction. Nor is it usual to do so. For instance, when a moving particle hits two resting particles and sets them in motion, it is never asked which part of the incoming particle's original energy has been transferred to the one of the other particles and which part to the other. The question even has a ring of absurdity. This has doubtless to do with the fact that the various parts of the energy cannot be distinguished experimentally, so that there is no empirical content in their distinction. Nevertheless, it is of course possible to form oneself a mental picture of the process in which the several parts of the energy have their own identity, although this cannot be verified by experimen? tal means. That even such a picture leads to grave difficulties has only become clear with the development of quantum mechanics. Already in Planck's original theoretical derivation of the law for the distribution of energy in black body radiation (1900), which ushered in the era of quantum</page><page sequence="5">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 89 theory, it is essential that the elements of energy possess no identity of their own. That is, the interchange of two energy elements must be considered as not changing the situation in any way; the physical states before and after the interchange are literally identical. This is not just one possible way of viewing things. If it is supposed that the states are different, although it may not be ascertainable experimentally, the statistics used in the derivation become different and this leads to a wrong form of the radiation law (viz., Wien's law instead of Planck's law). The mere ascription of an identity to the energy elements therefore entails consequences which are observably wrong. Later in the development of quantum mechanics it has become clear that the lack of identity which was mentioned above is not restricted to the case of energy elements. The same considerations apply to sets composed of particles of one and the same kind. For instance, if two electrons are scattered it is impossible to tell which one of the incoming electrons is the same as a chosen one of the pair of outgoing electrons. Even stronger, not only is it impossible to answer the question experimentally, but the mere supposition that an answer is possible (that is, the supposition that the electrons possess an identity of their own) leads to contradictions. This peculiar situation, which is in strong conflict with classical intuitions, obtains quite generally. Also if there is no interaction between the electrons, quantum theory tells us that there is no genidentity of the various particles. This means that if we make repeated measurements of the positions of n electrons we find at each measurement n places; but according to quantum theory it is not permitted to regard any two places in subsequent measurements as belonging to the path of one and the same particle. The theoretical description of so-called identical particles, of which some peculiarities have just been sketched, is an integral part of the modern formalism of quantum theory, quantum field theory. In quan? tum field theory physical interactions are described by means of the "annihilation" and "creation" of particles in various states. For the purpose of illustration consider an experiment in which energy is "transferred" from one particle to another by electromagnetic radia? tion. According to quantum field theory the original particle is "anni? hilated" and a new particle, with less energy is "created" together with a photon, i.e., an excitation of the electromagnetic field. Absorption of the photon by the other particle (I use the terms of the classical picture for clarity) is described as the annihilation of a photon and the second</page><page sequence="6">90 D. DIEKS particle, plus the creation of a new particle with more energy. As mentioned before, if quantum field theory is right it cannot be main? tained that the new particle is "really" the same particle as the one that was present before the interaction or that literally the same energy which was in the field before the interaction is in the particle after the interaction. It appears from the foregoing that according to modern physics the situation is like what is considered "mysterious" by Aronson in the above quotation; a loses all its momentum and b acquires the exact same amount. Actually there is no mystery here, because the inter? actions are governed by conservation laws. Although there is no genidentity in the quantum world (which, to the best of our knowledge, is our world), there is conservation of total amount of energy, momen? tum, etc. Thus, in a physical system with fixed energy there is at every moment of time the same total amount of energy, but there is no link between any two parts of the total energy at two different times. Physics therefore provides no ground for the belief that a literal transfer of energy and momentum takes place in physical interactions. The position that such a transfer constitutes the objective physical counterpart of what we in everyday language call the causal bond is consequently unwarranted. However, the flavor of the transference model can be rescued if we do not insist on the idea that literally the same energy and momentum are transferred in physical processes. We can consider energy and momentum densities as functions of space and time coordinates and we can calculate the changes of the densities if we vary the values of these coordinates. This gives us a rate of change in every direction. In this way we can mathematically define a "current" of energy and momentum. In view of the conservation laws the total "current" for an isolated system must vanish. If we bear in mind that the fact that we can work with such a current does not mean that amounts of energy of momentum are transferred in a literal sense (that is, while retaining their identity), we can now reformulate the transference model in terms of currents of energy and momentum. Indeed, in all examples presented by the proponents of the model it is possible without further changes to replace the notion of a flow of energy/momentum by the mathematical notion of a current of these quantities. Let us therefore investigate whether the transference model succeeds in giving an objective physical basis to the direction of causation by</page><page sequence="7">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 91 identifying this direction with the direction of transfer of energy and momentum; by the "transfer" of physical quantities we shall from now on understand the current discussed above. 3. It is an assumption of the transference model that the direction of the flow of physical quantities is uniquely determined and has an objective physical status. This is tantamount, as will be argued below, to the assumption that there is a unique "arrow" of time. But it is well-known from discussions about time that the idea of an "arrow" of time (and the related idea that there is a "flow" of time) is very problematical from a physical point of view. Physics only gives support to the conceptually quite different notion of temporal asymmetry in physical processes. Let me briefly discuss the crucial difference with an eye to its implications for the problem of causation. One of the most obvious characteristics of time as we know it from everyday experience is that it "flows". There is a privileged point on the time axis, the "now", which divides that axis into past and future; and this point is moving in a definite direction, viz., towards the future. As a consequence of this motion of the dividing "now-point", future moments are constantly changing into past moments. The correspond? ing picture of time, with which we are acquainted through intro? spection, agrees with the well-known A-sequence analysis of McTag gart. It is a remarkable fact that this familiar way of looking at temporal concepts does not find support in modern physics. As stressed by many authors,3 physical theory instead leads to a notion of time which is more in agreement with what McTaggart called the ??-sequence. Here we do not find a "flow" of time, or a motion of a "now-point". The time axis is treated in the same way as the spatial coordinate axes; and just as there is no privileged "here-point" on these spatial axes, there is no "now" on the time axis. The concepts of "becoming", "happening", etc., which are so familiar from daily life, are thus denied a fundamental status within physics. In the words of Weyl (1949), "the objective world simply is, it does not happen". This "static" way of looking at time has come into particular prominence since the development of the theory of relativity, but I think it should be stressed that it is also perfectly compatible with classical prerelativistic physics. It is true that Newton</page><page sequence="8">92 D. DIEKS himself in a famous passage says that "time, by itself, flows equably"; however, the notions of a "flow of time" and a privileged "now-point" cannot be distilled from the equations of Newtonian physics. The conceptual means to express such a flow are even completely lacking within physics, which becomes especially clear when it is asked how fast time flows. I believe therefore that it is justified to maintain that the notion of a "flow of time" lacks foundation both from the point of view of prerelativistic and from that of relativistic physics. Of course, this does not mean that there is something illegitimate in our distinction of past, present and future. The thrust of the foregoing remarks is that these categories do not have an ontic status according to a physicalistic point of view, in the sense that they do not occur in our best fundamental physical theories. Supposedly our way of seeing the history of the world as being divided into past, present and future must be explained on the basis of the workings of our consciousness; this division would then have a psychological status (though with a physical basis; see later on). What is the exact significance of this digression for the transference model of causation? The point is that if we do not employ the notion of a temporal flow we can only speak about the values taken by physical quantities at various moments; there is then, consequently, no flow of these quantities either. Suppose, to make this clear, that we consider a physical process in which two bodies (A and B) are taking part; we consider the process during a time interval Ai. At every moment A and B possess the well-defined amounts of energy, EA{i) and EB(t). Let us suppose further, for the sake of simplicity, that there is no field energy so that EA(t) and EB(t) are the only energies involved in the process. Then the energy conservation law takes the following form: EA(t) + EB(t) = E, with E a constant (the total energy) which is independent of t. EA(t) and EB(t) by themselves vary: there is an exchange of energy between A and B. But what is the direction in which the exchange is taking place? The answer to this question depends entirely on the order of time. Suppose we order time in the usual way, with At = [tx, i2] and tx &lt; t2. Then, if EA(tx) &gt; EA(t2), the energy of A has diminished during the time interval [tx, t2], whereas B has gained energy; the energy "has gone from A to B". However, if the "positive direction of time" is from t2 to tx, the direction of energy exchange is reversed compared to the preceding case. Now we would say that A's energy has increased from its low value at t2 to its higher value at tx\ consequently, there has been</page><page sequence="9">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 93 an exchange of energy from B to A. Mathematically this is expressed by the fact that the time derivative of the energy changes sign if we substitute -t for t. So, the notion of a unique direction in the transference of physical quantities stands or falls with the notion that there is an intrinsic direction of time; and this idea of an intrinsic direction of time is inextricably bound up with the idea of a flow of time, from past to future. But as we have mentioned above, from a purely physicalistic point of view there is no such flow of time. The directionality of processes in which physical quantities are changing, in the sense that it is only justified to say that there processes run one way and not the other, thus appears to be not an objective physical characteristic of these processes. To take an example: if we place ice cubes in a glass of hot water, there is nothing in the physics of the situation that would force us to say that there is a flow of energy from the water to the ice, instead of the other way around. This conflicts with the assertion by Aronson (1982) that in this case physics teaches us that we should say that the water causes the ice to melt and not that the ice causes the water to cool down. The reader may feel uneasy at this point since the above argument may appear to imply that there is a complete symmetry in time; that there is no difference between past and future. This is not so. To appreciate this it is crucial to make a sharp distinction between the following two concepts: an asymmetry in time and a direction in time. The difference can perhaps be brought out in the clearest way by a spatial analogy. Suppose we draw the graph of a function of the jc-coordinate, f(x). For the sake of concreteness, let us assume that this graph is asymmetrical in the following way: for x?&gt; ? &lt;*&gt; the function approaches the value zero and for x-&gt; + *&gt; the function increases without bound. Consequently, there is a difference between the behavior of the function in the two asymptotic regions. But it is obvious that this does not entitle us to conclude that there is an intrinsic direction in the X-axis. Of course, we usually assign coordinates in such a way that the negative numbers end up at the "left-hand side"; but this does not introduce a unique direction. There are two directions: one from positive to negative numbers and one from negative to positive. Moreover, we could just as well assign coordinates in the opposite way, with positive numbers to the left and negative numbers to the right. There simply is no inherent direction in the X-axis. Clearly, this does</page><page sequence="10">94 D. DIEKS not contradict the possibility of meaningfully distinguishing between various regions of the X-axis on the basis of structural properties of some function f(x). Whereas it is not difficult to convince oneself of the validity of the above remarks for the case of the spatial axes - after all, nobody maintains that there is an intrinsic left-right or right-left orientation, or still more absurd, that there is a "flow" of the "here", from, e.g., left to right - there is a difficulty in seeing that the same applies to the time axis. As argued above, from a physicalistic point of view the source of the difficulty lies in a confusion of psychological time with physical time. Indeed, the above considerations about the difference between an asymmetry and a definite direction of the X-axis can almost literally be repeated for the time axis. Instead of a function f(x) we now have to consider physical processes which are time dependent. Study of the properties of these processes can then lead to the notion of a time asymmetry. Strictly speaking, this asymmetry is not a property of time itself, but of the time-dependent processes which are considered. However, if the majority of a class of considered processes displays the same asymmetry we may speak about this asymmetry without reference to a particular process from the class. It turns out that practically all physical processes (at least if described in terms of macroscopic parameters) are asymmetrical in this way. In daily life the class of thermodynamic processes is the most important example. For instance, a hot object in cool surroundings always loses heat; motion always damps out by friction (although this friction may sometimes be very small, as in the case of the planets in the solar system). We further have the asymmetry of radiation processes: an electrically charged particle emits radiation after it has been accelerated, not before. On a cosmic scale there finally is the asymmetry connected with the expan? sion of the universe. In view of the pervasiveness of asymmetrical processes, reference is often made to the asymmetry of time tout court, without mention of the processes involved. It is important to realize that the above description of physical asymmetries does not rely on the notion of the "direction" of time. For instance, the assertion that hot bodies in cool surroundings (practically) always cool down can be understood as follows: pick an arbitrary hot body; this body will exchange energy with its surroundings, so that its temperature will not be constant. Suppose T(tx)&gt; T(t2) with T the temperature of the body as a function of the time coordinate; then for (practically) all other bodies which are warmer than their surroundings</page><page sequence="11">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 95 at time tx we shall find likewise that T(tx) &gt; T(t2). It will be plain from this formulation that the content of the assertion is completely in? dependent of whether tx &gt; t2 or t2&gt; tx; indeed, we are free to choose time coordinates either way, as argued before. Let us return to the transference model of the direction of causation. The motivation behind the model is to make sense of the asymmetry of the causal relation in the face of the fact that the basic laws of physics are time symmetric. The model accomplishes this task by supplying a definite direction to every individual physical process in the form of the direction of energy-momentum transfer. But the direction of energy momentum transfer can only be regarded as an objectively given direction, inherent to the individual process, if there is an objective direction of time. As we have seen, this latter concept is very dubious from a physical point of view. Is a reformulation of the transference analysis possible which instead employs the concept of time asymmetry that does possess a physical foundation? The following proposal seems to be obvious. Define the positive time direction in the usual way, for instance by stipulating that states of thermal disequilibrium be earlier than states of thermal equilibrium (of the same physical system). Now calculate the currents of energy and momentum in the usual way and call the physical systems which lose energy (in the positive time direction) during an interaction "causes"; etc. It should be noted, however, that this procedure does not attribute an intrinsic causal direction to an individual physical process; rather the procedure assigns a relative direction to every such process by compar? ing its evolution with the overall background asymmetry. Use is made of the fact that although the "direction of transfer" by itself has no objective status, the direction of transfer in one process relative to the one in another process is objective (the directions are equal or opposite, independent of the choice of the positive direction). But it is not clear a priori why this relative direction which can be assigned to every physical process should have anything to do with the direction of causation. As can easily be seen, the proposal to identify the direction of causation with the relative direction of energy/momentum transfer boils down to the proposal that, with the usual time ordering, objects which possess high temperatures are causally active whereas objects with low temperatures are causally passive (with the exception of those processes, borderlining the impossible, which are not in accord with the second law of thermodynamics, i.e., in which heat "flows" from cold</page><page sequence="12">96 D. DIEKS bodies to hot bodies). It surely is not self-evident that the asymmetry of the causal relation should in this way be related to differences in temperature. I shall come back to this question later. 4. There is another class of candidates for a physicalistic analysis of causation which encounter similar problems as the transference model, although they do not rely on the questionable notion of a flow of physical quantities. It is the kind of account proposed by J. L. Mackie in his book The Cement of the Universe (1974). Mackie offers an account of causal priority in terms of the notions of fixity and unfixity. For Mackie past and present events and states of affairs are fixed, settled and unalterable, whereas at least some future ones are still to be fixed, as yet undecided. However, some future events may already be fixed, namely if there is a sufficient condition for their later occurrence. The asymmetry of the cause and effect is supposed to result from the fact that an effect cannot be fixed at a time when its cause is not fixed. This leads to the following criterion: if A and B are causally connected in a direct line, then if B is fixed at a time when A is not fixed, it must be A which is the effect and B the cause. As observed by Mackie himself, this account possesses an objective status only if there is a real contrast between the fixity of the past and the present and the unfixity of some future events. But on a physicalistic analysis it is not clear what this contrast should be. The notion that the past is unalterable and fixed whereas the future is to a large extent still undecided, in other words that past and future possess a different ontic status, is in fact closely connected with the idea of a shifting "now", i.e., the flow of time. As argued before, physics does not lend support to the conception that the flow of time constitutes an objective physical phenomenon. As soon as the objective status of the "now" - which separates past from future - is denied, the objective meaning of Mackie's "fixity" becomes obscure. To see this it is perhaps useful to imagine a world in which there are no knowing subjects, but which is otherwise exactly like ours. This artifice will serve to prevent the intrusion of undesirable elements of a psychological nature into the analysis. In the world just described we cannot characterize an event by means of reference to some person's having experienced (or not having experienced) its occurrence. There is no "now" in this world - if we believe the physicalistic account - and</page><page sequence="13">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 97 therefore no objective distinction (as far as the mode of existence is concerned) between past and future. The whole history of the world forms one space-time, which can be represented by a four dimensional manifold as is customary in the theory of relativity. If the notion of "fixity" refers to the mode of existence of events or states of affairs - in the manner that they are either in the future or in the past - it has no objective referent in that world. But then it cannot have an objective physical status in our world either, because the only thing that is added in the transition to our own world is the knowledge of events possessed by knowing subjects. From a physicalistic point of view this is not relevant for judging the status of the events. There is, however, a second way in which we may conceive the notion of "fixity". We may use the idea of a deterministic physical theory and define an event as "fixed" at time t if a sufficient condition for its occurrence obtains at t. It follows from Mackie's account of causal asymmetry, which was summarized above, that Mackie employs both senses of fixity intertwined in his criterion for causal priority. Nevertheless it should be emphasized that two quite different concepts are at issue here.4 All events are "fixed" in the first sense of the word if we work with a tenseless notion of time. By contrast, whether or not all events are "fixed" according to the second meaning of the word depends on whether the universe is deterministic or not. In a wholly deterministic universe there is at any time a sufficient condition for the occurrence of all events at all other times, so that every event is "fixed" in the second sense. However, if the universe is truly described by an indeterministic theory at least some events are "unfixed" because there are no sufficient conditions for them. It is important to note that this latter "unfixity" can be a tenseless notion itself. It is not the case that an event which is undetermined by physical theory necessarily becomes determined as soon as it has actually occurred (this will be illustrated by an example further below). The fallacy which is very easily committed here is due to an ambiguity in the word "determined"; on the one hand there is the psychological notion of "being in one's past", "known to have happened" and on the other hand there is the notion of "fixed by deterministic laws". It is the very same ambiguity that leads to difficulties in Mackie's notion of "fixity". In what way do these difficulties reveal themselves in Mackie's account of causal asymmetry? As far as the first sense of "fixity" distinguished above is concerned, we have seen that from a physicalistic</page><page sequence="14">98 D. DIEKS point of view all events are fixed. Clearly, Mackie's criterion is useless then to single out a cause effect asymmetry. If we also consider "fixity" in its second sense, we have to distinguish between universes which are deterministic and universes which are not. In a deterministic universe again all events are fixed, so that once more we have no means to discriminate between causes and effects. This is a shortcoming of Mackie's account, because it seems Implausible to believe that the existence of an asymmetry between cause and effect depends on whether or not our universe is deterministic. It can be argued that causal asymmetry existed no less before the advent of quantum theory than after and if those who seek a deterministic "hidden variable" underpinning of quantum mechanics will succeed at some future moment of time, it is implausible to assume that this will affect the difference between cause and effect. But more important, it is not clear that Mackie's criterion is successful in an indeterministic world. In an indeterministic theory (which would be a true description of such a world) it will generally be the case that the conditions obtaining both before and after the occurrence of an event are insufficient to predict or retrodict that event. This means that the events which are described by an indeterministic theory are "unfixed" before as well as after the event. Quantum mechanics, which is currently believed to apply to all physical processes, is a case in point. Suppose that the physical data (a complete set of measurement results) at time tx determine a state vector | *l/(t)), t &gt; tx, for some physical system and that we are interested in the outcome of a measurement (at t2) of a physical quantity A. As is well known, quantum mechanics only supplies probabilities for the various outcomes: |(a? | i?j(t2))\2, if |a?) is the eigenvector belonging to the measurement result a?. The outcome of the A-measurement is there? fore unfixed before t2. Now, let us assume that the actual outcome is ak. If the measurement has been a so-called "ideal" measurement, the system must be described with the vector | ak(t)) after the measurement (i&gt; t2). The physical conditions at some time t3, with i3&gt; t2, can be represented by a complete set of measurement results at t3. But although these conditions may suffice to determine a state vector 11//(0) for t &gt; t3, they do not uniquely fix a state vector for t &lt; t3. This simply follows from the observation that all state vectors |a?(?)), and not merely | ak(t)), could have given rise to the same physical conditions at i3, albeit with different probabilities. From this it follows that the outcome of the A-measurement at t2 is unfixed at any time t. But then</page><page sequence="15">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 99 the notion of "fixity" evidently does not do its job in the indeterministic world of quantum mechanics either; it is impossible to base a concept of causal asymmetry on a notion of "fixity" which equally applies to all events at all times. That the "fixity" account leads to problems in a strictly deter? ministic universe was already noted by Mackie himself. This point has recently been taken up again by Newton-Smith (1983) who has offered an improved version of Mackie's account which is intended to obviate these difficulties. Let us briefly consider this new version. Newton Smith's proposal is based on a new definition of fixity, which runs as follows. At time t event A is fully fixed if both A has occurred and either there is no sufficient condition for A or a sufficient condition for A's occurrence has occurred. In accordance with Mackie's pattern of analysis, A is then the cause of B if and only if A and B are causally inseparable and any time at which B is fully fixed is a time at which A is fully fixed. To see the improvement on Mackie's analysis, consider a fully deterministic world. Let A occur at tx and B at t2 where A and B are causally inseparable. In view of the assumption of determinism, there is at time tx a sufficient condition for the occurrence of B. But B is not fully fixed until time t2. A is fully fixed at time tx. Thus any time at which B is fully fixed, A is fully fixed. Therefore A is the cause of B. The account thus leads to an asymmetry of causation in a deterministic world. The notion of fixity as defined by Newton-Smith is easily seen to rely even more than Mackie's original notion on the distinction between past and future. For instance, in an indeterministic universe (our universe, as far as we know) there is no sufficient condition for most events at any time. But then the new definition of fixity reduces to: at time t event A is fully fixed if it has occurred. The objections against the objective physical status of the concept of fixity and against its usefulness as a foundation for the cause-effect asymmetry therefore equally apply here as in Mackie's original proposal. 5. What should count as an adequate physicalistic way of analysing causation? The presupposition in the foregoing pages has been that in a satisfactory physicalistic account there should only be physical descrip? tions of events or states of affairs, that is, descriptions in terms of the</page><page sequence="16">100 D. DIEKS concepts occurring in physical theories, without reference to knowing subjects qua conscious beings. This requirement is, of course, only a necessary condition for any account to be physicalistic; further con? ditions will have to be satisfied in order to make a particular account satisfactory as a physicalistic analysis of a given concept. What then are the specific requirements for a physicalistic analysis of causation? Various points of view on the question of what an adequate analysis of causation should come to can be found in the literature. First, there is the viewpoint that such an analysis should make it clear what causation really means; accordingly, what we need is a semantical analysis or a definition of causation. A discussion of this viewpoint threatens to bring us into difficult and controversial questions about the meaning of meaning; I do not want to go into those questions. I think that independently of the particular position chosen here it is plausible that what we mean by terms like cause and effect is intimately connected with the experiences we have when we handle things, influence processes, exert forces, and so on. It is improbable that a physicalistic account, wholly couched in physical terms, could ever succeed in giving precise descriptions of these experiences of ours. Anyway, a semantical analysis is not what I regard as the aim of a physicalistic analysis. Second, the opinion is frequently encountered that a physicalistic account of causation should reveal what causation really is, what the true nature of causation is. The account in terms of the transference of physical quantities constitutes one example: the proponents of the transference model claim to have discovered that causation is the transfer of energy and momentum. I cannot concur with this conception either. There is a clear essentialist undertone in it: the presupposition is that there is fundamentally only one kind of causation, the nature of which can be found by physics. Moreover, the assumption is often implicit that a successful analysis will amount to an identification of causation with a relatively simple physical concept; that there is some more or less well-known physical notion which lies there waiting to be discovered as corresponding to the essence of causation. I think this point of view is rather implausible a priori. If we consider the various contexts in which the terms cause and effect are employed and the different shades of meaning we attribute to those terms in those varying contexts, there appears to be no obvious reason why there should be one physical paradigm underlying all these cases. For example, it surely is</page><page sequence="17">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 101 not prima facie probable that such different cases as that we consider the Big Bang to be the cause of the present condition of the universe and not vice versa, that we apprehend the death of a relative as the cause of grief, and the fact that we regard our hammer-blows as the cause of the motion of a nail should be explainable from the occurrence of the same physical processes in all cases. Of course, this does not prove anything; it might turn out that the same physical mechanisms do after all occur in all cases where we use causal concepts. But it seems to be overly restrictive to begin with taking as the objective of a physicalistic analysis of causation that it should reveal one "true nature" of causation. For this reason I want to advocate a third type of physicalistic account. Here the aim is to investigate whether our use of causal concepts in various contexts is related to physical characteristics of those contexts. The following strategy can be followed: starting from the patterns of use of concepts like cause and effect in a particular context, we can endeavour to determine what physical characteristics of that context make those patterns of use possible; put differently, what physical properties make our ways of using causal terminology con? sistent. If we succeed in executing this rather modest program we are in a position to give a physical explanation for the applicability of our causal concepts in the particular context we have considered. It may very well be that the study of a different context, in which we also use causal terminology, will lead us to regard other physical correlates for cause and effect. In this sense the type of approach advocated here is more general than the previous ones. Because the point of departure of the analysis in this third approach is the way in which human beings employ causal concepts, it is natural to expect that the relation of human beings to their surroundings will enter into the account. This will, however, not detract from the objective physical status of the analysis as long as no explicit reference is made to these human beings qua conscious beings. As long as we confine ourselves to the study of humans qua physical systems, partaking in physical processes, physical asymmetries, and so on, and do not use as basic in the analysis conscious experiences of causal efficacy, differences between past and future, etc., it makes no essential difference whether humans or complicated physical systems (e.g., computers) are considered. There is therefore no reason to doubt the physicalistic character of the analysis. Consequently, the approach here advocated is not vulnerable to the</page><page sequence="18">102 D. DIEKS charge of anthropomorphism. It may be maintained, however, that there remains something anthropocentric in it. The concepts of cause and effect are explicitly linked to the use human beings make of them; if there were no human beings in this world, it can be concluded that there would also be no causes and no effects. Can this be right? Or, in other terms, consider a parallel universe in all respects similar to the one we inhabit except that there are no conscious beings in it. Could it be correct to say, on the strength of a physicalistic analysis, that in that world there are no causes and effects although that world is physically speaking exactly like ours? I submit that it is indeed perfectly rational to hold such a view. As soon as we renounce the objective of making an identification of causation and some physical process, we can aspire only to ascertain the physical conditions which must be fulfilled in order to make our usual way of using causal concepts applicable to the world. But then, if we consider a hypothetical world without subjects who employ causal concepts, we can only say that the conditions for such use are satisfied (or not satisfied). Moreover, we can make the counter factual statement that if there were beings like us in that world, they could consistently use causal concepts the way we do (in case the pertinent conditions are fulfilled). But given that there are no such beings, there are strictly speaking no causes and no effects. It is perhaps of interest to note that the point of view that has just been expounded is in marked contrast with the one which lies at the basis of the so-called causal theory of time. The assumption of the causal theory of time is that causal concepts are in some sense more fundamental than spatio-temporal notions. In our approach the situa? tion is reversed: space and time are considered as the basic concepts in terms of which physical laws are formulated and thus as the basic ingredients of any physicalistic analysis. By means of such a physi? calistic analysis we can determine the physical conditions underlying the use of causal concepts; these concepts themselves only appear at the level of knowing subjects. Although causal connections may therefore have an epistemological role in the acquisition of knowledge about space-time relations by knowing subjects, they are not fun? damental in the ontological sense according to this point of view. 6. What does a physicalistic account of causation in the sense just set forth look like? To answer this question we must be able to say something of</page><page sequence="19">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 103 the patterns of use of our causal concepts. There are of course problems as soon as we try to determine unambiguously what the use of a concept is. Patterns of use may vary from one social group to another or even from one person to another. Fortunately, this need not bother us too much in the context of an analysis of causation. The reason is that there is a "core-meaning" of causation on which all authors on the subject seem to agree. This consists in the observation that we use the notions of cause and effect in the context of our manipulation of physical systems and our intervention in physical processes.5 More generally, we use causal terminology in the case of interactions between physical systems such that the evolution of the involved systems is disturbed. Although there certainly are other contexts in which we use the notions cause and effect, let us for the time being confine ourselves to this class of instances. There is a natural connection between the physical processes in this class and processes which define a time asymmetry. An extensive exposition of this connection has been given by Reichenbach (1956); I shall only mention the essential points. As mentioned before, the notion of time asymmetry is linked with the existence of de facto irreversible processes. It is not a trivial problem within physics why such processes exist at all. The basic laws of nature are all time symmetric (with the possible exception of a certain process in elementary particle physics, something which is of no relevance for the present discussion). This means that when we observe a process in which a physical system goes from an initial state S0 at t0 to a final state Si at tx, the fundamental physical laws tell us that the reverse process, which proceeds (at to) from a state identical to Si except that all velocities are reversed and which ends up at ii in a similarly reversed copy of S0, is also possible. Something more can be proved. A totally isolated system (a system without interaction with its surroundings) will display time-symmetric behavior. This means that departures from equilibrium will occur as often as approaches to equilibrium; moreover, in due course every deviation of equilibrium - however great - will be realized. Consider, as an example, a glass of water which is isolated from its surroundings. Physical theory tells us that if we wait long enough, ice cubes will form in one part of the glass, whereas the water starts to boil in another part. After this strange event has happened the ice will melt again and the water will cool down, just as we are used to observing. But in the history of the glass of water there are just as many of "strange" ice formation events as "ordinary" ice melting events. Why is it then that we, contrary</page><page sequence="20">104 D. DIEKS to the above account, never see anything happen like the spontaneous coming into being of ice cubes? The most important ingredient of the answer to this question has been made clear, after suggestions by earlier authors, through the systematic treatment by Reichenbach (and in somewhat modified version, by Gr?nbaum (1973)). The crux of the matter is that practically all physical systems which occur in nature, as far as we observe it, are not totally isolated. Deviations from equilibrium which are actually observed do not arise as a consequence of internal fluctuations, but as a result of interactions with the outside world. Take our example of the glass of water again. If there are ice cubes in the water, we of course do not assume that this is the result of an internal fluctuation of the water in the glass. Instead, we are sure that the ice has been put in there from outside. This is justified because the time scale on which we could expect ice cubes to develop spontaneously from the water is enor? mously long so that it is highly improbable that we have come across such an event; whereas we know from experience that it often happens that outside manipulation brings ice into water. Once the ice is in the water, the ice plus the water system will with overwhelming probability approach thermal equilibrium, unless the motions and positions of the ice molecules have a very special correlation with those of the water molecules. In this latter case it could occur that the surroundings of the ice cube cool even further, whereas the remaining water would become warmer. The physical condition which lies at the basis of the occurrence of irreversible processes as we know them from observation is, in Reichenbach's terminology, the "branch structure" of our part of the universe. The idea is that the part of the universe we live in is in thermal disequilibrium and that "branch systems" regularly split off from the main environment. Branch systems come into being in a disequilibrium state and remain isolated from the main environment for a certain period. The assumption is further that the formation of branch systems is a random process, in the sense that there is no selection mechanism which would give preference to one initial condition over another. It is this latter assumption about the branch structure of our part of the universe which makes the further cooling down of the ice cube - in our above example - so improbable (although not completely impossible). Systems which are created in a disequilibrium state through a process of interaction with the outside world are all branch systems. This analysis of the origin of irreversibility is of great relevance for</page><page sequence="21">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 105 the question as to the physical foundation of our use of causal concepts. As explained in the discussion of the "transference" account of causation, irreversible processes define a temporal asymmetry. It now becomes clear that this asymmetry is related to an asymmetry of C-type and E-type events defined as follows: C-type events are events of outside intervention, i.e., events of interaction with the outside world in which disequilibrium is created; E-type events are events in the history of the system in which there is a marked disequilibrium, but less than at the moment of creation of the disequilibrium. The branch structure hypothesis now says that in our part of the universe physical systems in whose evolution C- and E-type of events are distinguishable frequently occur and, moreover, that these C- and E-type events (practically) always occur in the same order. Of course, the usual convention of choosing time coordinates is the one in which E occurs at later times than C. But the asymmetry which is involved here is independent of the choice of the earlier-later direction. There is an obvious connection with causation in the following way: we regard interventions from outside (C-type events) as causes, whereas we consider the departure of equilibrium in the E-type of events as effects. The branch structure hypothesis therefore not only explains the occurrence of irreversible processes, but also makes it clear why it is consistent (in our part of the universe) to assume that causes always precede their effects. This is an example of how a physicalistic analysis can explain that our patterns of use of causal concepts are consistent. Let me briefly discuss in the following some other features of the proposed physicalistic analysis. Consider a cask of hot water, in which an ice cube has been thrown. The ice will melt and the temperature of the water will become somewhat lower. In the above analysis the throwing in of the ice can be viewed as the cause of the process in which thermal equilibrium is approached. Similarly, if some hot water is poured into a cask filled with ice the pouring in of the water can be seen as the cause. In both cases our normal usage of causal concepts can be accommodated. By contrast, the transference model, in which it is claim? ed that energy-momentum transfer represents what causation really is, wants us to say that in both cases the causal chain is from the water to the ice, viz., from high to low temperature. We see here clearly the different objectives of the two analyses. The transference model is normative in that it tells us how we should use causal concepts. The analysis proposed in the above is descriptive, in that it takes the</page><page sequence="22">106 D. DIEKS accepted usage of causal terminology as a starting point. I submit that it is a weak point of the transference account that it has normative pr?tentions without taking due account of what are considered im? portant differences between causes and their effects in daily life. Once again, suppose that we disturb a cask filled with water by pouring in some water of a slightly higher temperature; then the transference model says that the direction of causation is from the disturbance to the water. But if we pour in some water with a slightly lower temperature the model tells us that the direction of causation is from the water to the disturbance. The crucial role of disturbance itself, which is the same in both of these examples, does not receive any attention in the model. As mentioned before, in the absence of outside intervention there would be complete time symmetry in the behaviour of the water. In that situation there would not be much point in identifying a particular direction of causation. That the transference model nevertheless fixes one particular direction in such cases is therefore rather a weakness of the model. It is a weakness not unfamiliar from normative accounts; often there is something arbitrary in prescriptions how we should use our concepts. The fact that cause and effect can be distinguished, in contexts where systems are disturbed from outside, without the employment of tem? poral criteria is of great importance for the much discussed question of whether backward causation is possible. Of course, in daily life this is not a matter of much debate; many of our intuitions are even in? adequate if we try to imagine cases of backward causation. As explained above, this can be understood as a consequence of the validity of the branch structure hypothesis for our part of the universe: causes always precede their effects if that hypothesis is strictly valid. However, in the scientific literature the notion of backward causation (or retrocausation) is occasionally used, and in a way which fits in with the analysis presented above. Consider the following example. Suppose we have a physical system consisting of some medium in which waves propagate. Normally, if we create a point-like disturbance in such a system waves will spread out from the disturbance after the disturbing event. But now imagine that the following strange situation would occur as a rule. Long before the system is disturbed, waves start to contract towards the point where the interaction with the outside world will eventually take place. Exactly at the moment that I, by my own free will, touch the system with my finger all these waves come together at the precise spot of my finger. In physics this is known as "advanced</page><page sequence="23">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 107 radiation" and is often given as an example of retrocausation:6 the act of putting my finger in now causes the waves in the medium to contract at earlier times. It is clear that our above analysis which relates the 'cause' to the disturbing event can also handle this case and can thus be made to agree with the way causal terminology is used in scientific practice. Moreover, it it not hard to envisage physical conditions under which such events would occur frequently. Obviously, the branch structure hypothesis in its normal form cannot hold for these events; the disturbances in these hypothetical cases should have "special" charac? teristics. There should be correlations between spatially separated systems in circumstances where we don't expect them; but there is nothing in the laws of physics which would forbid such a state of affairs. Anyhow, in the hypothetical universes where retrocausation is a normal phenomenon and where, supposedly, retrocausal concepts would be current, a physicalistic analysis of the type defined here is just as possible as in our own universe. There also, it would be possible to account for the use of the (retro-)causal concepts on the basis of the analysis. By contrast, an analysis in the spirit of the tranference model tells us that in all those cases there is no backward causation: the direction of transfer of energy and momentum is from the waves to the place where eventually my finger will be - my finger gets kicked by miraculously contracting waves. As stated before, it is not a presupposition of our account that there is one meaning of causation or that there is one essential nature of causation. Also the supposition, frequently made in the literature,7 that there is one "core-concept" of causation, whereas there are various "generalizations" (in some sense) of this core-concept, or metaphorical use of the concepts cause and effect, is irrelevant for our purposes. We can freely acknowledge the existence of different ways of using causal concepts in various contexts, and inquire into the physical basis for these patterns of use. A last example, which seems to capture the notions underlying Mackie's account, may suffice here. In the cases examined thus far there was a structural difference between cause and effect, in that the cause corresponded to an intervention from outside. However, sometimes there is no such difference and yet we distinguish causes from effects. For instance, we may consider a closed physical system; there are then no interventions from outside and our earlier procedure for singling out the cause does not apply. Indeed, it may be argued8 that in an isolated system which is</page><page sequence="24">108 D. DIEKS described by the deterministic theories of classical physics everything is interconnected so that it is quite arbitrary to discriminate between "causes" and "effects" (actually this can even be maintained in the case of quantum mechanics because an isolated, and therefore not observed, system is described by a deterministic Schr?dinger type of equation). As mentioned before, the behavior of such a closed system is completely time symmetric and reversible, so that there is no way of establishing some kind of asymmetry between various states of the system on the basis of properties of these states alone. In spite of such arguments, we are wont to regard the earlier states of the system as causes of the later states. Our intuition tells us that the states in the past are unalterable, whereas the future states still have to be realized. Moreover, we often are in the position that we have knowledge of the past of the system and that we are able to predict and explain its future to some extent on the basis of that knowledge. The reverse situation, in which knowledge of the future leads to inferences about the past, is hardly conceivable. These common experiences, which guide our use of causal terminology in the context of isolated systems, seem to be fundamental to Mackie's account of causation in terms of the notion of "fixity". I have rejected that account as an objective physicalistic analysis of causation because in it reference was made to the physically unfounded notions of the past and the future. Nevertheless, a physicalistic analysis is possible here. Instead of referring to past and future as such we can refer to the asymmetry inherent in the workings of our memories, seen as physical recording-devices. The asymmetry of recordability can itself be explained along the lines of the "branch-structure account" of temporal asymmetry: memories (and other recording devices) can be considered as quasi-isolated systems.9 Once there has been an interaction with the outside world, which introduces a certain amount of order into the system (a low entropy state) there will occur processes in which the entropy will be increasing ("forgetting"); this is exactly on a par with the behavior of branch systems. Consequently, there is an objective physicalistic explanation of the asymmetry of recordability analogous to the account of temporal asymmetry in the behavior of branch systems. In this physicalistic analysis of the one-sidedness of memories (which makes use of the branch structure hypothesis) it can also be explained why there is an asymmetry between retrodictability and predictability. Now, we can describe our use of the concepts cause and effect for isolated systems as follows: of two states of the system at two different times tx and t2, the one at tx is regarded as the cause of the one at t2 if</page><page sequence="25">PHYSICS AND THE DIRECTION OF CAUSATION 109 (practically) all memory contents at t2 include the memory contents at tx. Although this formulation may have the appearance of anthromorphism, the above arguments show that there is no obstacle to an objective physicalistic account here. The different ways of assigning causes and effects in the case of isolated and non-isolated systems lead to different properties of cause and effect in these two cases. As argued, there is no objection in principle against the possibility of backwards causation if causes are identified with interventions of disturbances. However, if the cause effect asymmetry is related to the asymmetry of our memory-contents, it is clear that effects must always come after their causes (if the earlier-later order has been chosen in the usual way). Failure to distinguish between the various ways in which causal concepts are used seems to be an important factor in the controversies surrounding such questions as the conceptual possibility of backwards causation, the "nature" of causation, etc. In the strategy adopted here one is able to largely evade such problems by refraining from attempts to establish the "right" way of using causal concepts. Instead the analysis only starts when the use of such concepts in a certain context can be considered as given. This seems to be the obvious way to "make contact" between concepts known from daily life and the elaborate theories of mathematical physics.
