<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRAHMANISN. BY SIR A. C. LYALL, K. C. B., G. C. I. E., MEMBER OF COUNCIL OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. In order to bring out clearly the point of view from which I shall approach this subject, I must begin by a few preliminary observations. We know that Christianity, the highest and purest Faith in the world, has always been essentially a militant and mis sionary religion, pressing onward unceasingly to extend its doc trines and to make fresh proselytes. We know, also, that in the seventh century of our era another Faith arose, even more in tensely militant, more fiercely intent upon propagation than Christianity?the Faith of Mohammed or Islam. By this rival Faith Christianity was fiercely attacked, and was eventually driven out of Asia and Northern Africa, leaving only a few obscure sects, like the Armenians and Nestorians, surviving in countries which had once been almost wholly Christian. All the western region of Asia was easily overrun and converted by the Mohammedans; but eastward of Persia the spread of their religion ceased to coincide with the spread of their dominion; they could conquer India, yet they could only convert it very partially. In peace and war, they are always proselytising; nevertheless, Islam makes little or no material progress throughout Eastern Asia. A vast majority of the population inhabiting that side of the continent adhere to older beliefs, which differ profoundly from the creed of Islam. The dividing line, the religious frontier between East and West Asia, runs, therefore, through India; for the two great religions of the East, Brahmanism and Buddhism, are both of Indian origin; and it may be broadly affirmed that, while all the dominant religions of the world are derived from Asia, the whole eastern side of that continent, including Japan, has been profoundly and permanently affected by the teaching and traditions of an Indian</page><page sequence="2">BRAHMANI8M. 921 ascetic, Sakya Muni, the Buddha. Yet, although Brahmanism has exercised a vast influence over the beliefs and worships of Asia during many centuries, and still numbers, at the lowest calcula tion, more than two hundred million votaries, it is not a Faith that can itself be traced back to an epoch or a founder; nor can any concise narrative be here attempted of its course, its changes, or general development. The utterances of certain semi-divine sages, the philosophic systems of some great thinkers and commen tators, have authoritatively shaped the leading conceptions upon which the religion now rests; we know, also, that different ideas and rituals have been dominant at different periods, that there have been degradations and revivals, and that the doctrines and practices of North India have varied, and still vary, from those of the South. But here it is impossible to attempt more than a sketch in outline of the general characteristics of Brahmanism. In the first place, it is neither militant nor aggressively mis sionary: it does not openly attempt to make proselytes, in the sense of persuading them or compelling them to come in. Sec ondly, it is not historic; it has sacred books, but no sacred history. And, thirdly, it has never been defined by formal creeds, nor has it ever accepted a single personal Deity. The general character of In dian religion is that it is unlimited and comprehensive, up to the point of confusion; it is a boundless sea of divine beliefs and prac tices; it encourages the worship of innumerable gods by an in finite variety of rites; it permits every doctrine to be taught, every kind of mystery to be imagined, any sort of theory to be held as to the inner nature and visible operation of the divine power. Now, at first sight, this is not unlike the old polytheism of Greece, Eome, and the pre-Christian world generally, with its multitude of divinities and multifarious ceremonials. There are passages in Augustine's "Civitas Dei" describing the worship of the unconverted folk among whom he lived, the deification of "very natural object and even of physical functions, that might have been written yesterday by a Christian bishop in India. But then, one might ask, why was not all this paganism swept out from among such an intellectual people as the Indians, as it was out of the western countries, by some superior and more highly organized Faith? Undoubtedly, the permanent conditions and the course of events which contrive to stamp a particular form of religion upon any great people are complex and manifold; but</page><page sequence="3">922 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. into an analysis of these elements I cannot go. It is sufficient for my present purpose to point out that the two sheet-anchors of Brahmanism are the institution of Caste, and the Sacred Books, both of which were unknown to European paganism. The effect of Caste is to give all Hindu society a religious basis; and the Sacred Books provide Brahmanism with a theology, that is, with a science or philosophy of religion. I believe I may say that the old polytheism of the Bom an Empire had neither of these two things. According to Greek ideas, the business of framing laws for all departments of human life, of laying down rules of con duct, belonged to Politics; while the philosophers of Greece and Borne were rationalists and teachers of morals, they seem to have regarded the popular superstitions with good-natured contempt. They conformed to public worship that they might avoid odium and accusations of impiety, but they gave it no help or counte nance; and in philosophic discussions they treated the ordinary polytheism as unworthy the notice of serious men. They never, or very rarely, gave an inner meaning to myths and fables, or read the minds of the people through their fanciful beliefs. But the Indian philosophy does not ignore or hold aloof from the religion of the masses; it underlies, supports, and interprets their polytheism. This may be accounted the keystone of the fabric of Brahmanism, which accepts and even encourages the rudest forms of idolatry, explaining everything by giving it a higher meaning. It treats all the worships as outward, visible signs of some spiritual truth, and is ready to show how each par ticular image or rite is the symbol of some aspect of universal di vinity. The Hindus, like the pagans of antiquity, adore natural objects and forces?a mountain, a river, or an animal. The Brah man holds all Nature to be the vesture or cloak of indwelling, di vine energy, which inspires everything that produces awe or passes man's understanding. Again, it is very common in India, as it was in Greece and Borne, to deify extraordinary men, and the Brahman does not tell his disciples that this is absurd; he agrees that such persons must have been special embodiments of all-per vading divine power. In short, he accepts every variety of cult and objective worships as symbolical; it is merely the expression or emblem, suited to the common intelligence, of mysterious truths known to the philosophic theologian. In this manner, the gross idolatry of the people is defended, and connected with the loftier</page><page sequence="4">BRAHMANISM. 923 ideas. It is maintained that God is a Pure Spirit, but to make Him wholly impersonal is to place Him beyond the reach of ordi nary human interest and imagination; so it is well for the less advanced minds to be encouraged by forms and signs of His pres ence. All worship, it is said, is expressed through the senses symbolically. A temple or church is a visible mark of our belief that the divinity abides among us; an image is the mystical token of the indwelling spirit; while prayer and sacrifice are the pre paratory training toward more intelligent devotion. What we can conceive in our minds we may well picture to our eyes: and, by this method, the innumerable shapes and sacred places of Hindu polytheism are consecrated and adopted into the higher theology. It is on this principle that all the innumerable signs and carved images of divinity are accounted for among the upper classes. Each form, and every detail of that form, they say, is the outer clothing of some idea or impression; pictures and sculpture repre sent some mode of the divine presence: although the high doctrine is that knowledge, not worship or ritual, is the true way that opens the door to the soul's complete emancipation. Above and beyond the miscellaneous crowd of things and per sons, living or inanimate, unseen or embodied, that are worshipped as possessed by divine power, we have the great deities of Brah manism, from whom all this divine power proceeds, and in whom the principal energies and the fundamental laws of nature are personified. Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva are the realistic abstrac tions of the understanding from objects of sense. They denote Creation, Preservation, and Destruction, the constant succession of birth and death throughout all existence, the process of de stroying to produce, and of producing to destroy. Here we per ceive that, as soon as we pass upward through the disorderly mass of ordinary paganism, we come upon polytheism backed by philos ophy; we may scatter the irregular levies, and are confronted by the outworks of disciplined theology. The great Brahmanic Trinity are adored with various rites and sacrifices; they have in numerable temples, images, and personified attributes. Yet to all the more intellectual worshippers, Vishnu and Siva represent the course and constitution of Nature. And, if you inquire fur ther about these things, you will learn that all phenomenal exist ence is a kind of illusion, to be gradually dissipated by the acqui sition of knowledge; for the reality becomes intelligible only to</page><page sequence="5">924 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. those whose souls have been strengthened and clarified by long meditation, by ascetic exercises, by casting out all worldly thoughts and desires. To the eye of inner illumination, those who know God only by delusive appearances see no more than the shadow of divinity. And, conversely, to the empirical or naturalistic mind the whole religion is intelligible as a kind of reflection or mystical transformation of human experience, the vast shadow of the earth projected upon the sky. But all Hindus worship directly the high gods of Brahman ism. Brahma, having accomplished once for all his work of cre ation, has retired into the background of the popular Pantheon; he has very few temples or images; Vishnu and Siva divide the al legiance of devout and orthodox people. It is impossible here to give the diverse names or emblems under which they are wor shipped; yet some mention must be made of the Sakhtis?that is, of the divine forces of preservation and destruction, especially the female principle of productiveness, as personified by goddesses, the mates or consorts of Vishnu and Siva. The worship of women plays a material part in all polytheistic systems; and the grosser forms have been caught up and transmuted into loftier conceptions of divine maternity. In Brahmanism, the lower rites are unclean and disreputable, though they become purified in the higher regions of ideas; and a curious likeness may be observed between the consorts of the great Hindu divinities and the emana tions, or abstract personalities, of the Gnostic systems that pre vailed in the first ages of Christianity. These emanations were arranged in pairs of male and female; and, indeed, it is obvious that human speculation can only attach form or function to divin ity by drawing upon terrestrial analogies. Thus, Vishnu and Siva, with their consorts, are the pinnacles of the visible Brahmanic edifice; they are different manifestations of the Supreme Being; they represent among educated men sepa rate systems of worship, which, again, are founded on separate schools or opinions regarding the relations between God and man, and the proper ways and means of attaining to spiritual emanci pation. For, the whole purpose of the higher Brahmanism is to find and show the path which leads upward, from the simple un varnished popular superstitions to the true and pure knowledge of the Supreme Being, by laying out a connection between the upper and lower aspects of religion. One of the cardinal points</page><page sequence="6">BRAHMANISM. 925 upon which the two systems differ is in regard to what are called the Avatars?the bodily appearance of the Deity upon earth. Vishnu, according to those who belong to Vaishnava tradition, has several times descended upon earth, and has appeared in va rious forms. From the high spiritual point of view, this tradition may be interpreted as a devout belief which helps worshippers to realize, so to speak, the relations between divinity and humanity, which brings the Supreme Being within our limited powers of conception, establishes a bond of sympathy, and allows us to ad dress to Him prayers and offerings. In fact, the dogma of Ava tars is symbolical of the spiritual link and intercourse between God and man; it sanctions and gives meaning to a widespread popular tradition, that divinities sometimes come down and mingle with mortals and their affairs. Siva, on the other hand, is never represented by an image, al ways by an emblem of his powers, destructive or regenerative. He has no Avatars; and the high theologians of this school refuse to admit that the Deity assumes visible embodiment. They argue that, by assuming a man's bod}^, He would become subject to the laws of mortality, to changes, imperfections, human passions, and the like, to birth and death?and this they hold to be impossible, and inconsistent with the divine nature. The Avatar, they say, is an illusion. They permit and encourage all the rites and wor ships of the people as making generally for devotion; but they maintain that the only true spiritual path to salvation, for the superior intelligences, is by ascetic practices, by meditation, by separation from all worldly thoughts and cares; so that the soul gradually obtains true communion with the Supreme Being, and becomes at last absorbed, like a drop into the ocean, into light and rest. The metaphor sometimes employed is that the soul is like the flickering lamp, tossed by the winds and darkness, which loses itself completely in bright, noon-day sunshine, and remains still and quiet. To this doctrine, the reply of the Vishnu worshipper (I am quoting from a writer in a contemporary Hindu magazine ?the Dawn) is that it is too high for the people. Worship and prayer can only be addressed by ordinary folk to a personified Deity. The spiritual Brahma may be realized by intense thought and constant discipline of the mind, so that Spirit can commune with Spirit; but only the ascetic who has arrived at the loftiest stage of devotional contemplation can reach this height. Iir the</page><page sequence="7">926 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. meantime, what is to be prescribed for the untrained, inferior souls? Man's spiritual cravings are as strong and as natural as his physical wants. What, then, should be his spiritual food? He should take shelter under something, to inspire him with hope, liberate him from fear, and qualify him to be grateful and loving so that he may be loved in return. A theology which does not at tempt to be popular can never be generally useful; and so it is necessary to accept and believe in ways of approaching the Deity that can be used and understood by the people. Yet, each of these two schools only professes to show a different path to the same goal of the soul's liberation, and its absorption into Pure In telligence; for the Hindu mind cannot accept, as an ultimate no tion, a personal Deity caught in the meshes of time, space and causality. It must follow until He is placed somewhere beyond all phenomenal relations; although the problem of reconciling the conditional with the unconditional remains insoluble. This, I re peat, is the high philosophical religion at the back of the rough, outward, popular worship of all kinds of animals, stocks and stones, natural forces, deified men, local gods, and so on. I do not think that the common paganism of Europe in the old times had anything like this behind it, any more than the wild super stitions of uncivilized races have in other parts of the world at this day. And, certainly, the Indian religions have one great advan tage unknown, I think, to the ancient polytheisms'?they have their Sacred Books. This, then, is the philosophic religion at the back of the popu lar worship, to which it gives an explanation and a final purpose. For Brahmanism holds out to all men, as its scheme of salvation, the hope of escape from the pain and weariness of sensitive exist ence in any shape or stage. If a Hindu be asked what is the object and ultimate good that he is striving to reach through re ligious rites and devotional exercises, he will answer "Liberation." Whether he be peasant or pundit, his reply will be the same; he must free his soul, the divine particle, from the bondage of the senses, from the pressure of encompassing phenomena, and so gradually become united with spiritual infinity. To attain this union, it must pass through very many bodies or forms of life; and whether the passage be short or long, easy or arduous, depends upon a man's deeds, whether they be good or ill, pleasing or dis pleasing to the high gods. Belief in the transmigration of souls</page><page sequence="8">BRAHMANISM. 927 is common among all primitive races, having probably been stamped on the imagination of mankind by the constant alterna tion of death and life in the natural order of things animate. With the Hindus, it has become, universally, the shape into which they have cast the instinctive clinging to some future existence which belongs to all humanity; they are convinced that each birth is a waking out of sleep and a forgetting; and to the conception of a long journey, with many stages, they have added the good or moral purpose of purification and final changelessness. The inner self, that which speaks, is but a particle of the divine essence, which passes like a drop of water through cloud and river into the ocean. When we realize this to be the effective creed of Brahman ism, we can understand how such a system, with its long, laborious way to salvation, its antipathy to action, its preference of grace to works, and its conception of Divinity as something im personal, remote, and everywhere diffused, stands totally apart from the energetic, unwavering religions of the West, from firm reliance on a personal God, the Judge and Moral Governor of mankind, to Whom all must give immediate account after death. In regard to the Sacred Books, they contain, partly, the sav ings, precepts, and mystic utterances of the ancient sages; partly, prayers and psalms; and, partly, abstruse speculations on the di vine nature, with scholastic dissertations and commentaries. The modern students and teachers of the various schools or sects of Brahmanism treat these books as authoritative, and are constantly discussing, expounding, or adapting them to the ideas and cir cumstances of a people that is becoming profoundly affected by European modes of thought. One thing must be noticed in these Books, that they are not historical: they give no account of the rise or spreading of the religion, they do not trace it back to a founder, as in Christianity, Mohammedan ism, or even Buddhism. The Hindu would say, in the words of an early Christian Father, that the objects of religious knowledge are not historical, that such things in their essence can only be comprehended intellectually, or through divine inspiration. And the fact that Brahmanism has no authentic and universally ac cepted sacred narrative, that it is not concentrated round the life and acts of a personal founder is, I think, one reason why it has remained diffuse, incoherent, without a central figure or dominant</page><page sequence="9">928 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. plan. On the other hand, this very want, so to speak, of dogmatic! backbone has left the religion elastic and tolerant, has enabled its teachers to assimilate and adapt the lower forms of worship, in stead of endeavoring to destroy them. Perhaps I may now have succeeded in showing where lies the true strength and backing of Indian polytheism, which looks at first sight so irrational, grotesque, and superficial. It is upheld and interpreted by the Brahmans, who hold the stewardship of the mysteries; so that, as the worshipper advances in intelligence and culture, he may find explanations which satisfy him, and inner meanings to account for outward forms. Although the Brah manic religion is not militant, does not make war upon rivals, nor openly go about to make proselytes, yet it is always ready to in struct and admit the ignorant folk into its outer courts; and thus it gradually draws in the wilder races of India, who live in the woods and hills of the central region, or on the skirts of the moun tains. It comprehends and absorbs miscellaneous beliefs and worships, treating all divinities as manifestations of universal power, discovering germs of truth in the lowest layers of super stition, and treating the way of ascent to higher notions as a kind of ladder, leading by steps from the bottom to the top. "What is the meaning of Toleration in the Vedic sense of the word? Not that which makes all souls equal, all castes equal, and creates a confusion worse confounded, defeating the Providential design. The Sacred Teaching should be adapted to the souls in the order of their merit, but not that all souls, ripe or unripe, rude or unrude, barbarous or civilized.should be adapted at once to the Sacred Teaching. The right meaning of Toleration is?allowing each soul to stand on its own rung, and bidding it see below and see above, and understand that it has got over so many rungs, and that there are so many rungs to be got over still. The ladder is tremendously high. But if you should ill-advise that soul that its rung is false, and that your own rung, say several steps above the former, is true, and that it should get at once to your rung, is it possible or conceivable to jump over at once several intermediate rungs? In perfect concordance with the multifarious merits of the myriads of coexistent souls, the Perfect Lord has fixed the corresponding number of stages of religion." In this extract from the writing of an educated Hindu of the present day, we have the working principle of Brahmanism, and its attitude toward the people at large, very fairly expounded. Nevertheless, we have always to remember that, while the religion is tolerant, philosophical, and non-militant, yet, if Brahmanism were attacked by persecution, political pressure, or by some dis</page><page sequence="10">BRAHMANISM. 929 tinctly aggressive heresy within its own dominion, it would make an obstinate and dangerous resistance; and that any offensive dis regard of caste rules or social prejudices might provoke a violent insurrection. But this is merely to say that a pacific religion may be formidable in self-defense. The secret of Brahmanism, therefore, is to make abstract re ligious conceptions popular by means of symbols, pictures, and images; and conversely to recognize the rude idolatry and nature worship of the peasantry as being in some way the ignorant ador ation of the greater gods. At the bottom of the religious scale, this worship is addressed to hills, rivers, or animals, to the thing or creature itself. Next follows the process of personifying the mountain or the flood, the tiger or the boar; they are the embodi ment of deities who wield power, usually malignant; and it is gradually revealed that some profound theologic doctrine may be symbolically expressed by the same figures. On the slopes of the Himalayas, where Buddhism and Brahmanism are intermixed, they worship certain mighty female deities called the Divine Mothers, who are types or incarnations of powerful energies that can harm or help mankind. One of the most famous of these deities is figured to the people as the Diamond Sav, whose image may be seen at Benares, and who is also understood to be incor porate as the Abbess of a Buddhist nunnery in Tibet. Now, the Buddhist symbol of Ignorance, which is the efficient cause of all Illusion, is a pig; while, on the other hand, the wild boar, like other fierce and destructive animals, is worshipped by primitive folk in the hills and forests. A most capable observer, Sir John Edgar, believes?and I quite agree with him?that this aboriginal boar-worship has become identified with the philosophical type of ignorance and illusion; so that here we have at one end of the ladder of religious evolution a mysterious dogma, and at the other end a wild beast. We have the same example in central India, where the boar has become one of the twelve great incarnations of Vishnu, and I may quote an account of the transforming process, as it was described, thirty years ago, by a missionary who wrote the best handbook of popular Hinduism that is known to me: "To the south-east of Ajmere is a district inhabited by a tribe called the Minas. An incident in the history of one of their progenitors, according to their present tradition, has led them to look on the boar as a sacred animal, though this may be a relic of boar worship. When the Mohammedans came to India, the Minas seem to have confounded vol. clxxi.?no. 529. 59</page><page sequence="11">930 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. the Mohammedan horror of the boar as an unclean animal with their own regard for it as a sacred animal, and to have been induced, in some degree, to conform to their faith. In fact they were half con verted to Islam. Their old idol, however, they still worshipped, but gave it the Mohammedan name of Father Adam. Subsequently, the Saiva Brahmans got hold of them. They did not persuade them to give up the worship of Father Adam or of the boar, but simply to allow that Father Adam was a name of Siva, and to worship the cow as well as the boar. Temples were erected in their principal villages and stones placed in them bearing representations of Siva as Father Adam, of a cow and a boar, and inscriptions to the effect that the Mo hammedans respected the boar and the Hindus the cow, but the true followers of Father Adam respected both; and if they should neglect the worship of any one of the three, the worship of the other two would not benefit them. There are several Saiva temples in the district in which I heard the Brahmans invoke Mahadeva, and the Minas Father Adam." The truth is that the method of reconciling all these religions with a double face, with an outer form and an inward meaning, is Mysticism. The Mystic is one who is illuminated by the light of real knowledge, who discerns the veiled divinity or the secret doc trine behind symbols, who perceives the unity of spiritual truth under many forms; and whose business it is gradually to lift the curtain to those who are fitted to understand, while he allows the stage-play to go on in front for the benefit of the crowd. This is, I think, the secret of the true Asiatic religion, and to a great de gree the source of its strength and power of resistance. Of course, Mysticism has existed in all religions, and has everywhere had its dangers; everywhere, it has led to Pantheism, or the identification of God with Nature, and even to the self-deification of the Mystic himself?he fancies that he is himself divine and confuses him self with God. But, in the West, this dissolving power of Mysti cism, which reduces all positive, outward religious beliefs and wor ship to symbolism, and regards the historical facts of religion as mere shadows and signs of mysterious truths, has been vigorously resisted both by Christian churches and by Islam. Instead of ex plaining the lower worships, they have trampled out and destroyed them; they have insisted on the unequivocal acceptance of the facts of sacred history as essential to salvation; and, undoubtedly, this has been one main reason why the militant Faiths have con quered and kept a permanent dominion. But, in Eastern Asia, the two different faces of religion (I may call them the mythical and the mysterious) have remained</page><page sequence="12">BRAHMANISM. 931 and have worked together?the outer worship for the people who must have their innumerable deities, their images, and their miraculous legends; the inner teaching that explains all these things as symbolical, as signs and shadows of divine truths. You will understand that Hinduism and Buddhism have never set out formal creeds, containing articles of faith which a man must ac cept at his peril; they have not turned dogmatic propositions, such as those contained in the Athanasian Creed, into ecclesias tical laws, so that a heretic who disputed them might, as in the Middle Ages, be punished as a pernicious law-breaker. All these masterful methods of enforcing unity of belief, which gave the Boman Church such power in the Middle Ages, and which caused religious wars and long persecutions, are unknown to the tolerant and somewhat indifferent religions of Eastern Asia. The people could always worship as they liked; and the priests, or stewards of divine mysteries, did not attempt to persecute, because they treated all outward forms and rites as of little importance, the one thing really essential being the inner truth which lay behind. Nevertheless, I repeat that to my mind the strength, for re sistance against outward attack, of these Eastern religions lies in the fact that the polytheism is backed by the philosophy; the ruder worships are supported by intellectual explanations, and the two forms are closely allied; indeed, they blend and run into each other. But I do not pretend that this kind of un derstanding between simple worships and subtle interpretations is unknown elsewhere. On the contrary, the gradual elevation and refining of ritual and doctrine has always gone on, is still going on, in all societies that have a studious and intellectual priesthood. You find it in the Boman Catholic church, which has a scientific theology for the elect, and manuals of simple devotion, full of miracles and saintly legends, for the masses. But, while it is the business of theology to provide a reasonable ground for implicit faith, no Christian church openly allows tampering with the plain statements of historic fact contained in Bevealed Scrip ture, or permits articles of faith to be treated as anything but positive truths. Hinduism has neither one authorized revelation, nor a Church to guarantee and uphold it. Yet, in one way, the very looseness of its formation is an advantage, because it can as similate and find room for almost any religious conception, treat ing everything as a fresh manifestation of the all-pervading divine</page><page sequence="13">932 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. spirit. And Science troubles the Eastern Mystic no more than a fresh religion; for Science may be understood as merely a sym bolical language, shadowing forth the truths of divinity. One may even treat the Asiatic process of assimilating and melting down all religious ideas as belonging to the general intellectual tendency to accept the continuous growth and elevation by slow change of all forms and feelings, and the gradual development of higher and wider truths contained in primitive beliefs. As the Brahmans would put it, their religion has two forms: the interior, which is invariable; the exterior, which may be con stantly modified and adapted to circumstances. The interior truths, the divine secrets, the real way of salvation, are known only to a few; the great majority of men, being timid and ignorant, are concerned mainly in propitiating the powerful and malignant influences by which they fancy themselves to be sur rounded. As knowledge increases, as man succeeds in subduing and controlling the forces of nature, he overcomes or despises the troubles of this transitory life, he attains spiritual independence, and rises into a higher sphere of religion and morality. My suggestion is that a religion of this sort, which has its outworks in paganism, and its citadel in Pantheism, has always had great power of resistance and endurance, for the very reason that it can change and accommodate itself to social or intellectual conditions. How it will maintain itself in front of the rapid influx of Euro pean education and material civilization is another and much more difficult question. In India and in Japan, and to a certain degree wherever European influences have spread in Eastern Asia, they are changing the whole atmosphere in which fantastic superstitions, and metaphysical speculations, grow and flourish; they are introducing orderly government and pacific leisure, scientific methods of inquiry and critical reasoning. Yet, after all, the influence of Europe is mostly industrial and political; we are reorganizing the old-fashioned Asiatic governments and de veloping commerce and the sources of wealth. I hope that the morality, public and private, of the countries that are falling within the sphere of European influence will be improved. I am not sure what effect may be produced upon the profound spirit ualism of Eastern Asia. And this brings us to the weak side of a religion, which, though intensely spiritualistic, is founded on somewhat vague</page><page sequence="14">BRAHMANISM. 933 philosophy, and embraces schools of thought, accepts different theories as to the divine nature. It has no dogmatic rulings upon such questions as are settled by Christian and Mohammedan creeds; and since it has no ecclesiastical laws, it requires no man's implicit obedience to its teachings I do not say that Hinduism contains nothing more than philosophic speculations and devo tional rhapsodies. In the ascetic desire to be rid of the flesh, to extinguish worldly thought, and, above all, in the longing to escape illusion, change and all the ills of earthly existence, there is a dominant strain of morality; and the great doctrine of trans migration of souls may well operate as insisting on the penalties 01 sin and the way of ascending to salvation by purity of conduct. Yret Hinduism, and even Buddhism, has never succeeded in so limiting and clearly stating certain rules of faith and morals as to lay down and impress them upon the people at large, for their practical guidance in life. They have nothing, for instance, like our Ten Commandments or the Lord's Prayer, which order our lives and direct our consciences. It would be presumptuous to attempt any kind of prediction as to the religious future of India, what will be the nature and direction of the changes that must follow altered circumstances and larger experiences. The antique polytheism will probably disappear, though slowly, before wider and more precise concep tions and before a higher standard of rational morality. Long ago, indeed, the Hindu philosophy struck out one line of thought that undermines all anthropomorphic conceptions of divinity? that ultimate Being must be out of relation with the phenomenal world, except, possibly, by an unconscious projection of creative energy. But metaphysical ideas, though they are the central stronghold of all religious systems, have little or no influence upon the multitude; and the more practical question is, what effect will be wrought upon educated Hindus by the teachings of physical science. The supremely dominant principle of modern times is that the world is in a course of continual evolution, that life from the protoplasm is but a phase of immemorable existence, and that the death of individuals is merely the natural process whereby all material forms are thrown into the crucible for reproduction in fresh diversity. But this principle has already been recognized by Indian thinkers, with the vital difference that to them the whole order of nature was spiritual, it was stated in terms of vast</page><page sequence="15">934 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. metaphysical theories regarding the deified forces and the mys terious relation to phenomena of some Absolute Being from whom all souls issue, and to whom they return in dreamless sleep. The Indians could not agree to change a philosophic doctrine for a scientific discovery. On the contrary, they would accept Cole ridge's view that the development theory, a theory of progress as regards the physical being, is typical of the progress of man as a spiritual being; that the living soul, springing from an unknown eternity, is capable of endless improvement, ever rising higher and higher through numberless cycles of existence. They would firmly resist the invasion of the spiritual domain by uncompromising materialism, which would insist on dissipating all the allegories, symbolisms, personifications, and theosophies, leaving only the mechanical processes of plastic matter, the observation of phe nomena, and, possibly, as some cold comfort, the worship of Humanity. If we are to have the cultus of Humanity, why not of all sentient life, of Nature in its totality? And that will bring us round again to a materialistic pantheism. But the Hindu mind is essentially speculative and transcendental; it will never consent to be shut up in the prison of sensual experience, for it has grasped and holds firmly the central idea that all things are manifestations of some power outside phenomena. And the tendency of contemporary religious discussion in India, so far as it can be followed from a distance, is toward an ethical reform on the old foundations, toward searching for some method of reconciling their Vedic theology with the practice of religion taken as a rule of conduct and a system of moral government. One can already discern a movement in various quarters toward a recog nition of impersonal Theism, and toward fixing the teaching of the philosophical schools upon some definitely authorized system of Faith and Morals, which may satisfy a rising ethical standard, and may thus permanently embody that tendency to substitute spiritual devotion for external forms and caste rules which is the characteristic of the sects that have from time to time dissented from orthodox Brahmanism.
