<plain_text><page sequence="1">245 VERIFICATION, PERCEPTION, AND THEORETICAL ENTITIES BY MICHAEL LUNTLEY I The connections between the verificationism characteristic of the logical positivist movement and certain implausible theses about our perceptual capacities are well known. The unanswerable difficulties which beset instru- mentalist attempts to draw a clear distinction between theoretical and observational vocabularies formed the backbone to the broadly realist back- lash against instrumentalist philosophy of science. However, with the re- emergence of verificationist leanings in Dummett's influential work in the philosophy of languagel it behoves us to assess the assumptions about perceptual capacities in recent realist/anti-realist controversy. McDowell has focused attention on the nature of such capacities,2 but I shall not discuss his arguments here, for this would require a lengthy pruning of side-issues and complications peculiar to the philosophy of mind. I hope to show that the scientific realist's criticisms of instrumentalist theses about perception are compatible with meaning-theoretic anti-realism and, furthermore, are a necessary part of the anti-realist position. The consequence of this is that scientific realism requires much more supporting argument than is usually considered necessary, and that adoption of meaning-theoretic anti-realism does not restrict one's options in the philosophy of science as much as is commonly thought. This is important when one bears in mind that much of the criticism of anti-realism has identified it with a reductionism which implies perceptual theses that I shall be arguing against.3 As my immediate concern is with the philosophy of science, I shall hereafter refer to positivist verificationism as 'instrumentalism', reserving 1The main papers are to be found in Truth and Other Enigmas (London, 1978), especially essays 1, 10, 14, 21, and "What is a Theory of Meaning?

Pettit (Cambridge, 1978), and "Anti-Realism and the Epistemology of Understanding", forthcoming, where much of McDowell's argument hinges on the status of our perceptual capacities for seeing that another is in pain, and our general perception of meanings. 8For example, Dummett has often been classified as a covert behaviourist of sorts; cf. C. McGinn, "An A Priori Argument for Realism", Journal of Philosophy, 76 (1979), 113-33, and McDowell, op. cit. Particularly in the'latter case, this is connected with the fact that McDowell thinks Dummett committed to ideas about what we see when we see that another is in pain that are clearly linked to the problems about perception I consider below. For an independent argument against construing anti-realism as a reductionist thesis, cf. my "The Real Anti-Realism and other Bare Truths", in Realism and Anti-Realism in the Philosophy of Language, ed. A. C. Grayling (Brighton, forth- coming).</page><page sequence="2">246 MICHAEL LUNTLEY 'verificationism' and its cognates for Dummettian anti-realism. The termin- ological matter is important. I use 'anti-realism' as a proper name for Dum- mett's revisionist position in the theory of meaning, not as a description satisfiable by any position opposed to any sort of realism. I shall argue that such anti-realism is compatible with scientific realism just because it can be clearly distinguished from instrumentalism. My task is twofold. First, to show that anti-realism generally does not require constraints upon our per- ceptual capacities in the manner of instrumentalist epistemology. Secondly, to correct the view that anti-realism's most serious challenge is to account for scientific progress. This, of course, is Putnam's main worry about a verificationist theory of sense.4 As will become plain below (in ?V) anti- realism has no problems in accepting that there is whatever scientists and other empirical enquirers take there to be. It is only about the nature of the reality we ascribe to such objects that anti-realists will raise awkward questions. If scientific realism is the view that theoretical terms really refer,5 the anti-realist can accept that, but will ask whether the denoted entities exist independently of the possibility of our knowledge of them. The consequences of this for causal theories of evidence and reference will be noted below. II Before embarking on the main argument, a preliminary perspective may be gained on the issue by considering the following problem. In generalising the idea of proof-conditional semantics from intuitionist mathematics to discourse about empirical reality, what analogue should be employed for the concepts of "proof" and "effective decision procedure"? Intuitionists require that mathematical proofs be constructive, by which they mean that a proof of a statement of the form 3aA(a), where the variable a ranges over the natural numbers, is constructive just in case it proves a specific instance A(n), or yields an effective means, at least in principle, for finding a proof of such an instance.6 With discourse about empirical reality it is tempting to generalise the semantics thus: The meaning of a statement of the form 3aA(o), where the variable ranges over theoretical entities standardly held to be unobservable, is given in the conditions under which we have a proof of a specific instance A(n), or an effective means, at least in principle, for finding such a proof. But to undertake such a generalisation prompts the questions: What constitutes a proof of A(n)? and, What constitutes an effec- tive means for constructing such a proof? The analogues for these central semantic concepts are not readily forthcoming, and asking such questions 4See H. Putnam, "Reference and Understanding", in Meaning and the Moral Sciences, (London, 1978), 97-119, and also Lecture 11 of that book. 5See Putnam, op. cit., p. 19 ff., and the paper by Richard Boyd which he there refers to, "Realism, Underdetermination and the Causal Theory of Evidence", Nous, 6 (1973), 1-12.

Dummett, Elements of Intuitionism (Oxford, 1977), p. 9.</page><page sequence="3">THEORETICAL ENTITIES 247 tends to elicit the supposition that a proof of A(n) must always be a proof from some statement (or set of statements) about an effectively decidable state of affairs - an observation statement. In so giving the meaning of A(n) in terms of such non-trivially different kinds of statements, we tread the path from anti-realism to instrumentalism. In this paper I shall be arguing that we avoid this route by denying that the requisite analogue of proof be such a notion of proof from some set of statements agreed to be effectively decidable. One effect of such an argument is to increase the range of statements held to be effectively decidable. The problem is to find concepts to play roles analogous to that played by those of proof and effective decision procedure in intuitionist mathe- matics. Now the point of making the truth of some arithmetical statement depend upon its constructive provability is that the intuitionist will only count the statement as true if he knows it to be so, or is in a position to acquire such knowledge. To know that an arithmetical statement is true is to know a proof of it, or an effective means for finding one. However, with discourse about empirical reality, it is far from clear that knowledge of the assertibility of some statement consists in knowledge of a proof of it. In a great many cases, and it is the purpose of this paper to show that the range is huge, we can simply recognise the assertibility of the statement in question without that recognition being inferred from our assessment of the asserti- bility of statements of some other class. That is, on the present proposal, the analogue of proof required, when we generalise anti-realist semantics to discourse about empirical reality, is our possession and operation of recogni- tional skills for directly ascertaining the assertibility of the disputed state- ments. This is not to deny that the possession of such skills requires posses- sion of knowledge sufficient to justify one's recognition of some object if challenged, but it is to deny that the skill is, as it were, cashable out into such knowledge. The proposal is that the operation of such a skill is, in itself, ceteris paribus, a bona fide act of knowledge acquisition. The require- ment that possession of such skills is intelligible only on the supposition that one possess knowledge sufficient to justify a recognition if challenged serves to indicate the defeasibility of such skills. This is important in two respects. First, it might be thought that in making the ability to recognise that A(n) dependent on the ability to justify 'A(n)' if one's recognition is chal- lenged, we allow that the sense of 'A(n)' is given in the proofs appealed to in such justification, and will these not be the normal instrumentalist's proofs from such-and-such a class of observation statements? This objection is ill-founded, for if we possess a skill to recognise, on appropriate occasions, that A(n), then this state of affairs is as effectively decidable as an observa- tion statement. That we support this recognition, when challenged, by appeal to proofs, involves us in reductionist moves only as much as does the fact that picking up and biting an apple in order to show that I was not mistaken in my claim to recognise the fruit involves holding apples "reducible"</page><page sequence="4">248 MICHAEL LUNTLEY to the sum of the possible tactile and gustatory sensations evoked by them! Furthermore, if the initial idea of recognising A(n) is shown to be legitimate, then there is no reason why the items appealed to in proof of A(n), on those occasions that the recognition is challenged, should not, in being effectively decidable states of affairs, be as far outside the compass of what instrumentalists took to be effectively decidable as I will argue A(n) is. The whole point of my proposal is to redraw the limits of what is effectively decidable by replacing the traditional empiricist account in terms of observa- tion sentences with a broader conception in terms of that for which we possess the requisite recognitional skills. As such skills are learnable, the range of the effectively decidable in empirical reality may depend only on our ingen- uity and inventiveness.7 For a larger range of cases than is usually granted, I am proposing that an effective decision procedure for ascertaining the assertibility of a statement is simply: Open your (trained) eyes and observe. Secondly, it might be suggested that a prime virtue of the instrumentalist position lies in the fact that misperceiving A(n) is consistent with genuinely perceiving that p, where 'p' is framed independently of the theory inspiring A(n)- i.e., 'p' is an observation statement. But, if the recognition that A(n) is direct, there is no such level to escape to in explaining misperceptions - we can only say how things seem to us. However, the defeasibility of the recognitional skills which I am invoking allows us to handle such mispercep- tions without the need to invoke a level of seemings to which one retreats when the perception of A(n) is challenged and shown wrong. The recognition that A(n) is, after all, only a recognition ceteris paribus. From the vantage point of the present perspective, I shall now argue (?IV) that we do, contra the instrumentalist, have knowledge of theoretical entities without that knowledge being inferred from knowledge of a small class of observation statements. Furthermore, I shall argue that this is compatible with anti-realism (?V); that the case for scientific realism must therefore meet Dummett's semantic arguments against realism head on (?VI); and that the ensuing anti-realist possibilities in the philosophy of science have much to offer (?VII). But first, we recall some of the perceptual theses which were so contentious a generation ago. III At the core of instrumentalist epistemology was an identification of knowability with observability. The proper objects of knowledge were only those propositions describing observable states of affairs or those that were a deductive consequence of such propositions. This, of course, leads to what Ayer calls the distinction between primary and secondary systems of 7It might be thought that, on this approach, the open-endedness of the information required to support a recognition entails the impossibility of giving a general theoretical account of meaning for natural language. It would be impossible to treat this matter, even perfunctorily, here, so I shall ignore it, except to claim that the entailment is not as obvious as might appear.</page><page sequence="5">THEORETICAL ENTITIES 249 explanation8 and generally, to the idea that there is a sharp distinction be- tween theoretical and observational vocabularies. The epistemological un- certainty enjoyed by theoretical entities (they were held to be only induc- tively linked to observational reports and so subject to sceptical reproach) generated an ontological mistrust of such things. This suspicion is typified in such remarks as: In regard to an observational term it is possible, under suitable circumstances, to decide by means of direct observation whether the term does or does not apply to a given situation. . . . Theoretical terms, on the other hand, usually purport to refer to not directly observable entities and their characteristics.9 It is the claimed unobservability of theoretical entities which gave rise to doubts about their real existence. That being so, one typical counter-move by realists has been to pour scorn on the idea of unobservables. Maxwell's classic paper is a case in point.10 There he ridiculed the idea that observing through a microscope isn't really observing and asked should we, on the instrumentalist view, say that when we look through a window-pane, we can only infer that it is raining, while if we raise the window, we may "observe directly" that it is . . . rather than that, there is, in principle, a continuous series beginning with looking through a vacuum and containing these members; looking through a window-pane, looking through glasses, looking through binoculars, looking through a low-power microscope, looking through a high- power microscope. (p. 7) This continuity is to be matched by the continuity of things to be seen in our different observations: there is a virtually continuous transition from very small molecules (such as those of Hydrogen) through medium-sized ones (such as those of fatty acids, polypeptides, proteins and viruses) to extremely large ones (such as crystals of the salts, diamonds and lumps of poly- meric plastics). (p. 9) My object is not primarily to add to the discussion about the theory/ observation dichotomy, although I will, in the course of my argument, lend substance to Maxwell's polemic. My point is to show that there is much that an anti-realist will hold in common with the scientific realist's rejection of instrumentalist epistemology and its concomitant theses about perception. I will argue that the fact that our perceptual capacities are not 8A. J. Ayer, The Central Questions of Philosophy (London, 1973), pp. 109-10, 142-55. 9C. G.

IV My argument to show that we can, ceteris paribus, non-inferentially recognise objects usually deemed unobservable consists in subjecting the usual over-emphasis on seeing to a comparison with hearing. I will first sketch the example through which the comparison is made and then, in considering objections to the enterprise, show that there is a good prima facie case for the effectiveness of our perception of theoretical entities. Consider the case of a blind person unaffected by philosophical contro- versy. He hears a dog bark and is told, "There, now you know there's a dog here. That's him barking". On hearing a geiger-counter click he is told, "There, now you know there's a radiation source nearby". Will our subject be able to distinguish theoretical from non-theoretical entities here on the basis of some distinction between different kinds of perception? Without our visual prejudices, which suggest that perception of the former object is, in some sense, more direct than that of the latter, it is difficult to see how auditory perceptions are to support instrumentalist distinctions. Presumably, the blind man may be told something like this, "This is a dog, hear him barking. Feel him, he is an animal and makes this noise in a way similar to you or me speaking". With such information there is a means whereby the sound can be attributed to a particular kind of readily identi- fiable object. This is not apparently so with the radiation source, for its re-identification depends upon the continued operation of sophisticated detection equipment. The lack of such a requirement in the re-identification of the dog may suggest that some distinction between direct and indirect auditory perception is possible. In the case of the dog, it is enough that our blind person attribute the sound to an object that is also perceivable by tactile and olfactory sensations, but with the radiation source no such back- up is available. (I will return below to consider the importance of tangibility in characterising the observable.) But this labelling of "direct" and "in- direct" perceptions is hardly perspicuous as yet. It has an intuitive appeal when we are dealing with sight, but how it is to be unpacked for hearing is, I think, an illuminating question. The suggestion for a distinction between direct and indirect perceptions which I shall pursue is to say that the issue is a function of the number of intervening causal processes (ICPs) involved in a perception. On such a basis we might say that the geiger-counter's clicking is an indirect sensory input just because of ICPs between that which is responsible for the genera- tion of the sound and our perception of it, causal processes, that is, over and above those "normal" ones involved in any auditory perception. Conversely, the dog's bark is a direct sensory input just because it only involves normal processes. To make the distinction in this manner is, in effect, to say that</page><page sequence="7">THEORETICAL ENTITIES 251 we can distinguish between natural and non-natural perceptual processes. But the difficulty of justifying this distinction lies behind Maxwell's claim that there is a continuous series between perceptions of different kinds. For it will be said that whilst possession of a geiger-counter is superfluous for our having auditory perceptions at all, it is necessary for our auditory perception of radiation sources. This relates to the above quoted remarks about observing through window-panes, microscopes and the like. These need not be seen as mere polemic on Maxwell's part, but linked to the question of ICPs in perception. On the present suggestion, the whole weight of the instrumentalist distinction comes down to the question of how many ICPs it takes to make a perception theoretical. For whilst a microscope is not necessary for ordinary seeing, it is necessary for the visual perception of very small objects. And if the latter is a bona fide perception, then are we not at the beginning of a series of perceptions culminating in perceptions that essentially involve electron microscopes and the like? If not, then it must be said, at the stage of comparing naked eye and microscopic percep- tions, just what the importance of unaided perception consists in other than anthropomorphic prejudices. Indeed, this question arises whenever anyone attempts to draw a line between natural and non-natural perceptions. The value of raising this question about hearing is that it makes it a lot harder to find a plausible answer. In deciding what are to count as non-natural ICPs in hearing we would have to consider such questions as: Would we say that a man who only perceived sounds with a hearing aid had no direct sound perception, that he could not really hear sounds? When we speak on a telephone or listen to a record, do we hear the voice of our caller or the singer, or only the effect of their voices? It would seem that anyone wishing to uphold the theoretical/observational dichotomy in the case of the blind man and the sounds of the dog's bark and the geiger-counter's clicking would also be committed to drawing a line somewhere in the above examples. That we do not, as a rule, draw such distinctions serves to highlight their arbitrari- ness as they have been drawn by instrumentalists in the case of visual perception. The foregoing argument may, however, be thought susceptible to the following four objections. (a) In allowing that our blind subject can identify the dog not only through hearing but also by touching him, does this example not serve to underline the importance of tangibility in characterising the observable? Might not the instrumentalist claim that just this distinguishes the objects perceived by the two sounds and shows the radiation source to be a theo- retical entity? There are two considerations that tell against the feasibility of such a defence for the instrumentalist. First, and most importantly, the very problem that we are trying to resolve recurs within the range of tactile experience. Tangibility will only serve as an adequate criterion for observ- ability if we can first decide what items are subject to our tactile awareness.</page><page sequence="8">252 MICHAEL LUNTLEY What is to count as tangibly "observable" and what is not? For instance, although the feel of a dog would evidently be construed as a direct feel, what about the trained physician's feel of a hernia, of an irregular heart rhythm, of an enlarged liver, and so on? Considered only as tactile experi- ences, it is hard to see any reason for construing such feels as indirect, just as in the blind man example it was hard to see any reason for counting the hearing of a radiation source as indirect. Relative to our visual experience we may think it reasonable to count the physician's feels as indirect; that is, he only really feels irregularities in the patient's outer tissue and hypo- thesises hidden inner states to explain this. But the whole point of my discussion has been to break such emphasis on visual perceptions. Further- more, that we are able to construe some perception within a particular mode of sensation as indirect considered relative to some other mode of sensation (as the radiation source is unobservable relative to touch) is hardly a founda- tion for an effective ontological distinction between real observables and fictitious theoretical entities reducible, in some sense, to the former. If we cannot sort out any one mode of experience as basic, then we appear to be left with the proposal that the instrumentalist's favoured class of observables comprises the conjunction of those items directly observable by each sense, where this is defined in terms of the lack of abnormal ICPs in the perception. Secondly, given that the quality and range of our tactile experience varies considerably over different parts of the body's surface, then even if the instrumentalist felt he could accept the physician's "theoretical feels" be- cause they correspond to objects that may be directly felt during surgery,l1 it is not fanciful to suppose that genetic mutation might provide us with the ability to feel items currently outside the tactile range, e.g., large bacteria. But if so, why should we prefer such developments that owe their being to genetic mutation rather than those dependent on technological innovation? Once again, we must fall to considering the question of ICPs in our perceptions. (b) The instrumentalist may now protest at my characterisation of the theoretical/observational distinction in terms of the number of ICPs present in a particular perception along the following lines. It may be said that we need to distinguish between those cases where the causal processes are all of one kind and those where they are of essentially different kinds. For example, although there is no difference of consequence between looking at an object through a window-pane and through normal atmosphere, there is a difference between these cases and observing through an electron microscope. How- ever, for such an objection to hold, we would need to know whether this entailed that seeing someone over a closed-circuit television link is, or is not, a bona fide perception. An analogous case in auditory terms would be to ask whether, on such an objection, a partially deaf person was only granted "1How the instrumentalist will accommodate the modality here is something positi- vists never satisfactorily answered. I will not press the issue here.</page><page sequence="9">THEORETICAL ENTITIES 253 genuine hearing when using an ear trumpet and not when using a deaf aid? Clearly, the involvement of different kinds of causal processes in a perception does not, of itself, question the legitimacy of the perception, but the present objection serves to raise consideration of two ways in which the perception may be doubted due to deviance in the causal process. The first case is deviance in the sense that one questions whether the interface, as it were, between two kinds of causal process is subject to a law-like correlation. However, such deviance involves a scepticism more extreme than that encountered in instrumentalist thought and I shall ignore it here. The second case is deviance in the sense that the perception is not the immediate consequence of a causal interaction with the subject - the perceived object may then no longer exist at the time of the perceiver receiv- ing the image. This second sort of deviance may suggest to the instrumen- talist a modification to the present objection. (c) Although we might speak of seeing the object in a "live" television broadcast, or a deaf person hearing with a deaf aid, few can now say that they have seen Lloyd George, or heard the Great Caruso. The requirement that perceptions involving different kinds of ICPs are legitimate only if "live" would then licence the instrumentalist claim that this is due to their being reducible, in some sense, to possible perceptions without the relevant technology. (The modality again poses problems for the instrumentalist as observed above in note 11.) Now clearly, we are disinclined to speak of seeing when considering recorded sensory inputs, for the object concerned may no longer exist. Seeing has at least this resemblance to knowing; you cannot be said to see what does not exist; and you cannot be said to know what is not so. So we say we have never seen Lloyd George, but only a film of him; we have not heard the Great Caruso, but only a recording. But this does nothing to rule out perceptions via ICPs of more than one kind. The instrumentalist has yet to say why the occurrence of such varied intermediaries in perception should incline us to think the object concerned does not exist. He could, after all, claim doubts about the existence of objects "perceived" in unaided perception by saying that we really only see the light of distant galaxies and not the galaxies themselves even though they are often described as visible to the naked eye, if the point was a worry about the time lapse in perceptions of these kinds. So although such com- plexities in the causal processes involved in perception compound the possi- bility of error, this is not to say that it cannot be overcome. (d) If I have agreed that perceptions can be counted genuine only if the object in question exists, how are we to know this? The instrumentalist might reply: only if the object is perceptible without the intervening tech- nology. It is not hard to see what has gone wrong with this bare refusal to countenance perceptions involving the sophistications of technology used in the many sciences. We must recall the point of ?II above that possession of a skill to recognise some item is dependent on the possession of knowledge</page><page sequence="10">254 MICHAEL LUNTLEY sufficient to justify the recognition if challenged. Take the case of our recognition of other people and call that knowledge, upon which we rely to back up our recognitions of others, part of our everyday theory of persons. Although we simply recognise when an object is a fellow person, this recog- nition is justifiable by reference to our theory of persons. This fact gives some reason for doubting the recognition of persons via, say, television links. The reason is that the technological intermediaries between the object and perceiver restrict the possibilities of applying such theory, and leave the perceptual skill isolated from it. On the other hand, meeting someone allows a good deal of information to be acquired that would be impossible to obtain from the television, just because one is involved in a certain amount of interaction that feeds our theoretical requirements. It is this that makes meeting someone so special and of greater use than watching them over a television link, not because one is thereby closer to them without ICPs in the perception. Knowledge that some object is not a sophisticated automaton is not gained by standing very close to it, as the instrumentalist objection to ICPs seems to suggest. It is gained through the consequences of the object's actions on our theory of persons, consequences measured through the inter- action we achieve with the object. But the same point holds just as well of micro-particles. Our perception of these would be problematic if all we could say of them was that they were streaks of green that appeared in cloud chambers when certain conditions obtained in the apparatus. If we could not interact with these things, deflect them, speed them up, make two or more collide, then there would be something suspicious about their status. But we can do these things, and it is the effects these objects have on our theoretical knowledge, whether in terms of actual or possible manipulations of them or, more abstractly, in terms simply of the theoretical consequences of, say, counting a faint point of light a distant star, that provides the logical space in which these entities exist. This is to break any identification of knowledge and observability and to make our knowledge of particulars much more dependent on that information (whether it properly be called "theoretical") gathered from the interactions (manipulative and theoretical) obtained with particulars. Such information constitutes our proofs, or methods of verifica- tion, by which we ascertain the assertibility of statements to the effect that there are such things as micro-particles. In which case, there is no problem with perceptions via, e.g., television links due to the intervening technology which might incline us to accept "live" perceptions because reducible to uncluttered"normal" perceptions; the problem is to do with the lack of interaction and the ensuing divorce of the recognitional skill from its sup- porting theory. Only someone in the grip of a philosophical theory could suggest that two-way television links, or telephone conversations, do not provide genuine perceptions. This, I have argued, would be required by the instrumentalist epistemology. I conclude then that there is a good, prima facie, case for thinking that</page><page sequence="11">THEORETICAL ENTITIES 255 we can, contra instrumentalist epistemology, non-inferentially recognise "theoretical" entities. The ability to do so is not, of course, universal. There is a division of perceptual labour here of a kind with Putnam's division of linguistic labour in securing reference for natural kind terms. It remains to be seen what follows from the possession of such skills. V Returning to the case of the blind person and the examples of the dog's bark and the geiger-counter's click, then, apart from this talk of ICPs, there is another totally separate question to be considered when thinking about the correctness of a realist attitude to the objects identified by these two sounds. Consider the following two questions. Could our subject, if asked, determine whether or not a dog was in the room with him, or whether or not a radiation source was there? If the object's presence is not effectively decidable, then one may be led to suppose that statements describing such things are not necessarily either true or false. One may accept those anti- realist arguments which claim that no sense can be given to supposing such statements necessarily bivalent if the decision procedures for their asserti- bility are non-effective. Of course, if one took the distinction between direct and indirect perception of these objects seriously, it could be argued that there was no method by which our subject could determine the presence of the radiation source. Because this perception depends on ICPs, the relevant technology may not be available to make the detection of radiation possible. The anti-realist withholding of bivalence for statements about radiation sources would then be dependent upon the instrumentalist's theory about our essentially indirect perception of such things. However, I have argued that such instrumentalist theses should be rejected, and I will now show how the anti-realist position has no necessary connection with instrumentalist ideas about ontology developed from theses about the directness or otherwise of certain forms of perception. We can, and must, separate these points. Common to both is the idea of ICPs in perceptions of certain kinds. If we are to perceive radiation sources, certain sophistications of technology are required. That, in itself, is an uncontentious point, but there are two uses to which it can be put. (This point is similar to one about the perception of others' pains, that in order to perceive that another is in pain, it is necessary that he behave in a certain manner. This is the nub of Wittgenstein's question about how we should imagine that a stone has pains.) First, there is the idea that I have rejected, that the necessity for such ICPs implies that the things perceived via them are some- how unreal, or of only derivative ontological status, dependent on directly perceivable objects. Although agreeing wholeheartedly with those realists who scorn such theses about our perceptual capacities, there is still the further point about the determinacy of the reality of the objects so perceived. We might reject the identification of knowability with observability which</page><page sequence="12">256 MICHAEL LUNTLEY gave rise to the old positivist form of verificationism, but the newer verifica- tionism which identifies knowability with provability, and the recognitional skills supported by such proofs, still has a pertinent point to make. For example, no matter how generous one feels about counting a-particles as real because we can, on occasion, effectively know of their existence, we still have the problem of whether or not we have any right to say that there must be a determinate answer to the question of whether there is an c- particle crossing the room now. The problem arises from the fact that the meaning of an assertion that such a particle is crossing the room is given by a subjunctive conditional whose antecedent is most likely counterfactual. But again, although this might force us to take an anti-realist attitude to such statements, so that we do not insist on bivalence for them, it does not commit us to holding any ontological reductive theses about them. Instead of arguing that only if we can observe these particles are they real, and we cannot observe them, therefore they are not real, as the instrumentalist does, we ask the following. Granted that only if we can produce effective evidence for the existence of such particles will we count them as real, can we however claim to be able to do this on all occasions? On those occasions when the antecedent of the relevant subjunctive conditional is actually satisfied, we are content to accept that science has shown the existence of such a particle. Indeed, the anti-realist will insist that this is what it means for there to be such a particle, that certain procedures are carried out and such results arrived at. In that case, the anti-realist will be the first to admit that there are, and have been shown to be, such things as o-particles. He has no problems with that. What he will question is our right to insist that the reality of such things is a possibly recognition-transcendent affair, in that a determinate answer is guaranteed to questions of the truth and falsity of statements like: (1) There is an c-particle crossing my study now or, (2) If a cloud chamber were situated in my study now, it would react in such-and-such way. The anti-realist will not baulk at epistemological problems about whether we can see that there is a particle crossing the cloud chamber, or, in the case of others' pains, see that the other is in pain. However, he will ask whether, when we do see that a particle has crossed the chamber, we are seeing something which may occur without any recognition by us. That, and that alone, is what the anti-realist will challenge.l2 If, on those occasions when the relevant procedures are carried out and the evidence is forthcoming for the assertibility of the presence of invisible particles, or others' pains, then so be it. There are these things, but only in the sense in which an 12This is why I believe it important to get right the question of the status of our perceptual capacities, to see it as devoid of any wrangle over the ontological status of "theoretical" entities like micro-particles or pains.</page><page sequence="13">THEORETICAL ENTITIES 257 anti-realist will make any ontological claims. In not requiring that his proofs be prooffrom such-and-such epistemically and ontologically privileged class of statements, the anti-realist will hold that there are only those things for which we have effective decision procedures. There are no questions of ontology over and above this.13 VI I have argued that the anti-realist need not deny that terms such as 'a-particle', 'electron', 'gene', etc., refer; what he questions is the determinacy of the reality to which they refer. In so far as I took scientific realism to be the thesis that theoretical terms refer, anti-realism is compatible with this and the rejection of instrumentalism. But, of course, scientific realists would insist that far more is at issue here. I take it that the thesis that theoretical terms refer has been meant to imply that they refer to a reality that exists independently of our ability to know it. This is required in order to give substance to the idea of convergence in the history of physical theory.14 That is to say, I do not expect my argument to induce scientific realists to embrace anti-realism in the theory of meaning, but rather to show that realism as generally intended in the philosophy of science does involve a need to counter Dummett's arguments against meaning-theoretic realism. Realists such as Maxwell, or more latterly Putnam and Boyd, have taken the main problem as being that of giving an epistemological account of how theoretical terms refer. (Boyd, in particular, has lately given some detailed analysis of the use of metaphors in science from which he generates a notion of "epistemic access" which he thinks allows him to state, in a more general form, the essentials of causal theories of reference and knowledge. He thinks that the notion of reference is fundamentally an epistemological one and that "the issue of reference for a general term is the issue of its role in making possible socially co-ordinated epistemic access to a particular sort of thing or natural phenomenon". The mark of epistemic access is the "relevant sort of socially co-ordinated epistemic success".16) But if the scientific realist must counter Dummett's arguments against meaning-theoretic realism, then causal ac- counts of epistemic success will only work if they show us to be causally l3For further argument on this point see my "The Real Anti-Realism and other Bare Truths" (note 3 above). 14Cf. Putnam, op. cit. and Boyd, op. cit. It is not clear that Putnam can still accom- modate the idea of convergence, given his apparent volte face in "Realism and Reason", Presidential Address to the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association (December 1976), reprinted in Meaning and the Moral Sciences, 123-40. It is interesting to note that Boyd, "Metaphor and Theory Change", in Metaphor and Thought, ed. A. Ortony (Cambridge, 1979), no longer seems to accept Putnam's position (cf. p. 408n.). For various definitions of scientific realism, see Bas C. van Fraassen, The Scientific Image (Oxford, 1980), Ch. 2, and note that in Mathematics, Matter and Method (Cambridge, 1975), p. 69, Putnam did include the idea that reference be reference to an external independent reality in his account of scientific realism. He does not appear to recognise the possibility that the question of reference per se and the sort of reality to which we refer may be separable. 16"Metaphor and Theory Change", pp. 358, 384.</page><page sequence="14">258 MICHAEL LUNTLEY related to objects that may exist independently of possible recognition by us. The anti-realist may speak of epistemic success via unproblematic observation of micro-particles and the like. It is another matter whether in so doing, we are gaining access to objects that exist independently of our possible knowledge of them. If we are, the argument for scientific realism needs to tackle anti-realism head on, rather than arguing against instrumen- talist epistemology. That Boyd thinks that obtaining a satisfactory notion of epistemic access constitutes a problem is indicative of the extent to which instrumentalist epistemology is seen as the main opponent for realists. Of course, I do not intend the above as an argument against Boyd's important case for realism, but only as suggestive of the territory over which such debate must range.l6 If I am right in thinking anti-realism to be innocent of instrumentalist epistemology, then as anti-realists we can begin to do philosophy of science with a clear conscience and without encumbering the dead weight of largely successful arguments against earlier verificationists. VII In so far as the compatibility of anti-realism and the acceptability of certain recherche areas of science has been suggested by the earlier part of my argument, then it may seem that I have made anti-realism out to be a much more acceptable, and far less radical, doctrine than might otherwise have been thought. The last couple of pages should have scotched that idea. I have now suggested that the anti-realist will, for statements like (3) There is an ot-particle crossing the cloud chamber now be quite happy to accept the determinacy of its truth and falsity, providing the chamber is operational now, because it is decidable in virtue of our observa- tion of the particle; an observation justifiable, if challenged, in terms of our theory of the workings of cloud chambers. However, he will not accept that bivalence necessarily holds for (1), because its assertibility conditions are given by a pair of subjunctive conditionals of the form (2), whose antecedents may be counterfactual. But surely the realist will respond that the whole point of the development of scientific theories is to achieve a unification of sense to such assertions. What else, he might ask, does our theoretical knowledge achieve other than that there are such things, irrespective of our abilities at any time effectively to prove their existence? Indeed, so plausible is this response that it will seem that my arguments serve only to produce a reductio ad absurdum of anti-realism. I think that this is not so. Essentially, this counter-challenge from the scientific realist amounts to saying that the theory of meaning has no role to play in determining what there is in the world; it is rather up to science to tell us what there is. But, as we have seen, the anti-realist can accept the scientist's conclusion that there are a-particles and electrons, or the plain man's that there are pains; 16For specific arguments on Boyd's position, see T. S. Kuhn, "Metaphor in Science", in Metaphor and Thought, 409-19.</page><page sequence="15">THEORETICAL ENTITIES 259 what he will question is whether these things exist independently of the possibility of our knowledge of them. On my proposal, the anti-realist restricts reality to entities for which we have effective decision procedures. On the strength of the foregoing argument this cuts right across the tradi- tional boundaries between theoretical and observational, or mental and behavioural statements. Perhaps we should see the scientific realist as purporting to offer some sort of transcendental argument to the effect that we are obliged to under- stand scientific achievement in a realistic manner on pain of not being able to account for the developments that have occurred in the sciences.17 I shall not consider the possibility of such arguments here, but it suggests that the case for scientific realism needs to be conducted at a level other than that at which it is normally. However, there is a much more important reason why I do not consider such transcendental arguments here. This is to do with the legitimacy of the realist objection I canvassed at the beginning of this section. It may well be thought that given the fact that anti-realism seems to entail a difference in the way one treats statements (1) and (3), then whatever difficulties one has in producing good transcendental arguments, this is preferable to the anti-realist alternative. What remains to be pointed out is the nature of this alternative. The realist response to anti-realism's treat- ment of (1) and (3) is to claim that it ignores the unification of sense achieved by the scientific community for these statements. Regardless of how this can be supported by transcendental means, I shall now show that this point has seriously underestimated the strength of the anti-realist position. For consider this: Is it necessary that anti-realism countenance a difference in sense between (1) and (3)? A moment or two's reflection should show that it is not. An anti-realist theory of meaning will insist that (1) and (3) differ in sense only in referring to different regions of space-time. The meaning of a statement to the effect that such a particle is crossing a particular portion of space-time is just that if the relevant instruments were to be situated there then they would react in such-and-such a way. This meaning, given in the subjunctive conditional, is invariant whether or not the region of space-time is accessible. Presumably a realist would agree in thus character- ising the meaning of such statements, so the nub of the matter lies in what may be extracted from this. The anti-realist will only say that, if as in (3) the particular region of space-time falls within the confines of the relevant detection equipment, then the statement is bivalent. On the other hand, (1), in referring to a region of space-time not so fortunately endowed, cannot be said necessarily to be bivalent. Of course, (1) is the statement that an oc-particle is crossing my study at a particular time, now. That this is, 170f those who call themselves scientific realists, Rom Harre has been the most willing to call his position Transcendental Realism: see his Natural Being (Oxford, forthcoming). See also R. Bhaskar, A Realist Theory of Science (Leeds, 1975).</page><page sequence="16">260 MICHAEL LUNTLEY contrary to realist intuitions, held not to be necessarily bivalent does not rule out the possibility that some statements about cc-particles and my study at some other time t might be bivalent if the relevant detection equip- ment is available at t. That such similar statements should vary in their bivalence would only be indicative of a-particles problematically popping in and out of existence, if existence were thought of as independent of our ability to recognise it. After all, intuitionists allow that some statements about numbers are bivalent whilst others are not, in particular those quanti- fying over infinite domains. Similarly, the scientific anti-realist (to coin an ugly phrase) may allow that some statements about empirical reality are bivalent whilst others are not. That there should be this difference between (1) and (4) There is an oc-particle crossing my study at time t where t is some time when I do possess the relevant detection equipment, is no more puzzling than that there should be such a difference between (5) There were 126 paper clips on my desk on March 7th, 1980 and (6) There are 126 paper clips on my desk now. The question of bivalence for (4) and not (1) is, like that for (5) and (6), a function of the general anti-realist account of other times18 and is not a matter of hostility to the existence of micro-particles as such. But in that case, in giving such central importance to the question of realism about other times, should I not say what is to count as an effective decision pro- cedure for statements about the past? Some past-tensed statements are true, yet in making the anti-realist's ontology consist only of that for which we possess such procedures, how is this to be allowed? I cannot answer these points here, but the idea that they pose serious difficulties is contrary to the change of perspective heralded in ?II above. A realist would deny that any present evidence guarantees the truth of some past-tensed statement p, but this is only because he assumes that the sense of 'p' is so very distinct from the evidence for its assertibility. However, analogous to the sort of expanded account of effectiveness I have presented for empirical reality, it would be open for the anti-realist to say that some procedure E, by which we assess the assertibility of p, is effective yet defeasible evidence for p. When the realist complains that E does not guarantee p's truth or falsity, we simply ask, "Guarantee what? What is this conception that overreaches our methods for determining p's assertibility?". That is, some criteria, in what I take to be Wittgenstein's use of the term, may be found that effectively determine the truth of some past-tensed statements, although they could not determine the past as the realist believes he conceives of it. From this perspective, it is not so much that the anti-realist is restricting reality in some reductionist manner, but that the realist is, unintelligibly, enlarging i8Cf. Dummett, "The Reality of the Past", Truth and Other Enigmas, 358-74.</page><page sequence="17">THEORETIOAL ENTITIES 261 reality. At this point the onus of proof lies with the realist, who must say just what it is he thinks the anti-realist is denying.19 Therefore, the anti-realist will portray the difference between (1) and (3) as about determinacy of truth-value, not meaning. Of course, it has often been the case that the question of the determinacy of truth-value has been raised in consequence of a difference about meaning. This is how we should characterise the instrumentalist position. He would hold (1) not necessarily either true or false, because reducible in meaning and ontological import to sets of statements giving observational reports. However, if the anti-realist agrees with those criticisms of such perceptual and ontological theses that I have considered, there is no reason why he should hold (1) and (3) different in meaning rather than in the determinacy of their truth-conditions. So, that science has achieved a unification of sense for statements about the whereabouts of micro-particles does not, of itself, show that such sense must be characterisable within a realist theory of meaning. The question of the unification of sense is one thing, the question of how that sense should be treated in a general theoretical manner is another. It is here and here alone that the dispute between realists and anti-realists in the philosophy of science must take place, and given that we can separate anti-realist epistemological and perceptual theses from those of the instrumentalist, the anti-realist position gains much by way of respectability. There are still some very difficult questions to be answered, about how and why this unification of sense has taken place. The realist will want to argue that it is because of an underlying ontological unification. If my argument is correct, this question is much more open than might otherwise have been supposed. The difference between realist and anti-realist in this respect comes to this. In cases like (3), the required bivalence has been achieved since we have an effective decision procedure for our statements; the realist takes this as a warrant for asserting bivalence of related cases that lack such decision procedures. But the anti-realist might see cases of bivalent state- ments only as symptomatic of that general evolutionary strategy which favours our finding determinate answers to the questions we put to nature; and all he need then question is the legitimacy of the realist warrant for generalising from such cases to those where the requisite decision procedure is non-effective.20 Linacre College, Oxford 19Undoubtedly, the realist will say that the anti-realist is denying the objectivity of the past, and I have said nothing yet to show how such a complaint may be countered. It is a large question, but for a start towards the development of a viable anti-realist account of objectivity in the philosophy of the social sciences, cf. my "Understanding Anthropologists", Inquiry, 26 (1982). 20I am grateful to Michael Dummett and Rom Harr6 for helpful comments on earlier stages of this work.</page></plain_text>
