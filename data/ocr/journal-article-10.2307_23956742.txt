<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God. II : Essays in Anthropomorphism, by A. Marmorstein. (Jews' College Publications, No. 14.) Pp. vii+163. (Oxford University Press, 1937.) Dr Marmorstein's five essays constitute an examination of the rival preferences for allegory and for literalism among early Jewish teachers in their interpretation of the Scriptures—Scriptures which are pronouncedly anthropomorphic in their references to the nature and workings of God. The problem as treated by Philo for the edification of his co-religionists in Alexandria is familiar : between the literalism which arose from piety and reverence, and the scoffing condemnation of those who, literalists likewise, found anthropomorphic language barbarous and ridiculous, stood the allegorists (including some of the Septuagint translators) who tried to avert criticism and misrepresentation of the Bible, and so to protect the dignity of God in Jewish doctrine. Dr Marmorstein shews the same process at work also in Palestine, and he marshals material indicating that among the Tannaim, ' there were</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 179 two schools, one opposing, and the other defending the literality of the Biblical text on which their theological outlook depended and their conception of God was based. This division was carried on by the great teachers of the Amoraic period. On the whole, one can say so at the outset, the anthropomorphic trend of mind so warmly defended and propagated by R. Akiba and his followers gained the upper hand first, and the greater number of teachers adopted his view; whilst only a small minority cherished and dared to propagate allegorical doctrines'. In his fourth Essay, Dr Marmorstein deals with some of the habitual formulae which characterize literalist and allegorist; e.g., אלמלא מקרא ׳ כתוב אי אפשר לאומרו Were it not explicitly written in Scripture, it would be impossible to say such a thing' (literalist); וכי אפשר לומר כך ׳ Is it possible to say so ?' (allegorist); ׳ וכי תעלה על דעתך לומר Could you even think of saying ... ?' (allegorist); דברה תורה כלשון בני אדם 'The Torah speaks in human fashion' (allegorist); משמיעין את האוזן ׳ מה שיכולה לשמוע The ear is suffered to hear what it can understand' (allegorist); while the very common כביכול Dr Marmorstein regards as the mark of the literalist. This last expression is a philological puzzle; and he proposes to explain it as the initials of the words כיוצא בדבר יש ׳ כת ואפשר לומר Similarly it is right and possible to say . . .' Dr Marmorstein comes to the conclusion that it was precisely those rabbis who, like R. Akiba and R. Meir, had imbibed foreign culture and known the attraction of allegory and the satisfaction of mind which relegates the idea of Godhead to the realms of abstract speculation— it was they, particularly, who were strongest in their insistence on the literal meaning of the Scriptures. ' They were fully aware that by divesting the heroes of the Bible of their real existence, whether faults or virtues, by transforming them into abstract virtues or academic faults, the most vital forces of historic consciousness become weakened and falsified.'</page></plain_text>
