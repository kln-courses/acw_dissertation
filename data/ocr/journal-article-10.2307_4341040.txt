This collocation, found eight times in Aeschylus and always with the T,,v8v elided, does not occur in Sophocles, Euripides, or Aristophanes. PhQ 19 (1940) 147 (Spaeth) Carmen Arvale. For the meaning of lue, rue, pleores, Semunis, see under RELIGION: BICKEL Cato. R. E. SMITH. Cato Censorius. A study of the personality of Cato the Elder. The author, after dis- cussing the nature of political biography in the ancient world, subjects Plutarch's biography of Cato to a critical examination and concludes that Plutarch's account is an "inanimate" biography, little better than a caricature, because Plutarch, adopting the traditional character of Cato as the enemy of progress and the foil to the phil- hellenic Scipio, has Cato move about exhibiting certain moral qualities. The author claims that a fresh examina- tion of the evidence, especially of Cato's own works, proves that less than justice has been done to him; far from being merely a narrow and vindictive reactionary, Cato held political views which sprang from a true concern for the well being of the body politic. G&amp;R 9 (1940) 150-65 (Vlachos) Cicero. RUDOLI SYDow. Kritische Beitrage zu Ciceros Sestiana. Critical notes on Pro Sest. 7 (p. 164 Klotz), 12 (168), 14 (169), 16 (171), 23 (174), 37 (183), 69 (203). RhM 89 (1940) 74-8 (Heller) D,onysius Halicarnassensis L. RADERMACHER. Phidias in eijent iibersehenen Zitat aus Dionys 7rEpt LUJuGEW,3s The Phidias mentioned by Dionysius, according to a scholium cited by Spengel (p. 166) on Arist. Rhet. 1371 b 6, is hardly the great Athenian, but may be identical with an artist of the second century B.c. Hence the ref- erence to him is an addition by the scholiast, and the fragment otherwise, with one slight correction, may be genuine. RhM 89 (1940) 78-80 (Heller) Epicurus. HANS HERTER. De physiologia Epicurea. Exegetical note on a passage in a papyrus from Hercu- laneum edited by W. Schmid (Ethica Epicurea, Leipzig, 1939). RhM 89 (1940) 80 (Heller) Galen. ERNST WENKEBACH.

Notes, mostly critical, on Gorgias' Defense of Pala- medes. 3. Exegetical notes on the first prooemium of Lucretius: the composition of 44-49, 67-79, and how Lucretius, an Epicurean, could pray to Venus.

PhW 60 (1940) 349-51 (Plumpe) Plato. KATHLEEN FREEMAN. Plato: The Use of In- spiration. Show that Plato's attitude towards poetry is understandable if one accepts Plato's concept of the ideal man. Grant that the ideal man is he in whom the intellect is supreme and the intellectual method the only means of apprehending the truth, and Plato's adverse verdict on the validity of the poet's inspiration is the logical derivation from his premises. Plato's assumption that intellect and the poetic faculty are in complete oppo- sition is due to Plato's inability to admit any other method for arriving at the truth but the scientific method. And lastly, Plato's evident irritation against the man of inspiration springs from an inner conflict, the quarrel between the poet and the philosopher within himself. G&amp;R 9 (1940) 137-49 (Vlachos) Soranus. F. ERNST KIND. Zu Sorans Repositions- technik des vorgefallenen Fusses. The following cor- rections of the text of Soranus are proposed: p. 139, 3, Ilberg, 7rEfL o TOoXJov instead of &lt;TO0&gt; 7reptvaLov; p. 139, 4, Ilberg, aVTO instead of avTOv- AGM 32 (1939) 333-6 (Edelstein) Statius.

CR 54 (1940) 13 (Jones) Tacitus. HELLMUT ROSENFELD. Die Dioskuren als AEVKO) 7rwxk und die alces = Elchreiter der Vendalen. Alcis in Tac. Germ. 43 is (a miswriting for) nom. plur., meaning 'elks, stags', animals frequently associated in Germanic religion and folk-belief with spirits of light and fertility. Just as Euripides referred to the Dioscuri as 'the two white colts', so the Vandals called these Indo- Germanic cavaliers by the name of an animal which was first their outward embodiment, later, when anthropo- morphism took place, their steed. (See below, Religion, Bickel and Naumann.) RhM 89 (1940) 1-6 (Heller) PHILOSOPHY. RELIGION. SCIENCE BAUMANN, E. D. Die Krankheit der Jungfrauen. The pseudo-Hippocratic treatise, Diseases of Virgins, is in- terpreted as a rational explanation of a psychic epidemic ascribed by the people to divine influence. Janus 43 (1939) 189-94 (Edelstein) Die Katalepsie der Antiken. Collection of passages concerning the name of KaTrXdN.'iS and the character of the disease with special emphasis on the teaching of Soranus (Caelius Aurelianus). Janus 42 (1938) 7-24 (Edelstein) BICKEL, ERNST. Nordische Stammgut in der romischen Religion. Welcomes Rosenfeld's suggestion with a few additional notes on the passage (see above, Ancient Authors, Tacitus) ; then reviews certain matters of Roman religion in which we should see, not Greek in- fluence upon the Italic peoples after their arrival in Italy, but concepts which they brought with them from the north. A cult of the twin gods existed at Rome be- fore the founding of the temple of Castor. The fire of Vesta was originally laid in the chilly north; Terra Mater was older than Cybele at Rome, and Tacitus (Germ. 40) observed a Germanic parallel to her cow- cart. Certain words in the Carmen Arvale (lue, rue, pleores, Semunis) should be interpreted against an Italic background: Norden's Greek parallels are misleading. The Saturnian verse of this hymn likewise should not be regarded as Greek. Altheim's doubts of Jupiter's Italic origin are unfounded: rather, this god conforms to the Nordic and Indo-Germanic concept of the great sky-god, whereas Zeus, under the influence of certain Mediterranean cultures, was a god of mountains and storms. Finally, the essentially Roman reverence for numina is in strong contrast to the anthropomorphic tendencies of Greek religion. RhM 89 (1940) 12-43 (Heller) DILLER, HANS. Die Lehre vom Blutkreislauf, eine verschollene Entdeckung der Hippokratiker? Rejection of the claim, revived during the past few years, that the circulation of blood was known to the Hippocratic writers. AGM 31 (1938) 201-18 (Edelstein) ERHARD, HUBERT. Hippon als Biologe. Short outline of Hippon's biological theories which are characterized as unoriginal and mostly dependent on Thales and Pythagoras. AGM 32 (1939) 325-8 (Edelstein) EsSER, A. ALBERT M. Antike Gasvergiftungen. Dis- cussion of a few passages from Roman literature in which poisoning through gas is mentioned. AGM 32 (1939) 21-6 (Edelstein) GERLACH, WOLFGANG. Das Problem des "weiblichen Samens" in der antiken und mittelalterlichen Medizin. Short survey, especially of the Aristotelian and Galenic theories of female semen, and a clarification of the influence of these ideas on later centuries.

The different names used in classical antiquity for fenugreek are collected and the qualities of the plant described. Janus 43 (1939) 123-30 (Edelstein) NAUMANN, H. Tiergestaltige Gotter in Germanien? In support of Rosenfeld's thesis (see above, Ancient Authors, Tacitus), discusses other evidence, scanty enough in case of great gods, more abundant in case of daemons, for theriomorphism in early Germanic religion. RhM 89 (1940) 6-11 (Heller) ORIENT, JULIUS. Romische chirurgische Instrumente aus dem Randgebiet Pannoniens. Enumeration of Ro- man instruments found in Hungary. AGM 32 (1939) 136 (Edelstein) ROBERTSON, D. S. The Flight of Phrixus. All mod- erns (with the exception of Wilamowitz) represent the ram who carried Phrixus as flying. The ancient evi- dence, however, is conclusive that in the original story it swam. It is so represented in all known art before the Hellenistic period and by all writers with the excep- tion in Latin of St. Augustine and in Greek of Nonnus and a few prose-writers, only two of whom are earlier than the Christian era.
