Every reader of the Bible knows that God created human beings in His "image" (be-salmo). But what exactly is that "image"? What is it that God and human beings share? Lorberbaum's central claim is that in the tannaitic literature God is construed anthropomorphically. This claim in fact involves several distinct claims that the author usefully summarizes in the Introduction (pp. 12-23): the Tanaim construed God in a way that ascribes to Him human capacities and qualities; the anthropomorphic notion of God is reflected in their view of man, i.e. in their anthropology no less than in their theology; the anthropomorphic notion of God is not only a matter of abstract theological conceptions and speculations, but has consequences for halakhah, e.g., the types of punishments authorized; some Tanaim rejected anthropomorphism. From the narrow perspective of the history of science, the chapter in which Lorberbaum surveys the history of scholarship on tannaitic views of God is of particular interest. He does not delve into this history simply for the 308</page><page sequence="2">sake of completeness. Rather, most earlier scholars ascribed to the Tanaim non- anthropomorphic notions of God, and Lorberbaum sets out to show that they were in fact unconsciously projecting onto the texts their own anti-anthropo- morphism, which they inherited from medieval Jewish philosophy, notably Maimonides. In other words, these scholars succumbed to what Gadamer calls a historic "prejudice," which conditioned their scholarly interpretations of the tannaitic texts. This seems to be a plausible thesis: when teaching the Guide of the Perplexed one often faces the incredulity of students when told that Maimonides wanted to extirpate anthropomorphism among his contempo- raries. "Ironically," Lorberbaum concludes (p. 78), "the Maimonidean radicalism of the twelfth century has become the orthodoxy of modern Jewish studies." Lorberbaum defines the aim of his own approach, which he describes as "ethnographic," as follows: "to reconstruct a worldview or a frame of mind from the 'inside,' i.e. from the viewpoint of the thinker," striving not to apply any preconceived theological or metaphysical presuppositions to it (p. 104). These words will sound familiar to most historians of science. What about Lorberbaum's own interpretations? Are they supposed to get at the actors' views as they really were? Or are they too informed by some historically conditioned "prejudice," perhaps the tendency of recent Israeli historiography to extirpate "myths"? Lorberbaum does not deal with this question, which is indeed easier to ask than to answer.</page></plain_text>
