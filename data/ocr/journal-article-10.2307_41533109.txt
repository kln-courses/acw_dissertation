A. MARWOOD The last three lines are within a previous erasure. The symbols on the front ends of the bolsters are not easily identifiable : that on the right may be the crescent and disc of Caelestis. In roughly the centre of the externally-facing side of each bolster is carved a human face perhaps representing respectively Sun and Moon. The left side of the die bears a relief of a genius wearing a mural crown ; the left hand supports a cornucopiae : the right pours a libation over an altar. The right side of the die depicts a cupid holding a bunch of grapes in the left hand and a sickle or bill-hook, perhaps of oriental type, in the right. The stone was found in the course of F. J. Haverfield's excavations of 1910, re-used forming part of the uppermost surface, thought to belong to 369, of the road bisecting the depot of Corstopitum and south of "Site XI". The reading and expansion of the familiar Dolichene formula ending the last line ("by command of the god") is now widely accepted as given above. Translation : "To Jove the eternal Dolichenus and to Caelestis Brigantia and to Salus, Caius Iulius Apolinaris, centurion of the Sixth Legion, by command of the god". General Remarks on the Date of the Ai.tar As nothing remains of the words replaced, the fact of the erasure tells us little ; it could represent an original mistake by the stonecutter or a rededication at an unknown date. The date of the inscription is directly indicated by four factors ; the known or probable dates for the presence at Corbridge of vexillations of the Sixth Legion, the known prevalence of the cults involved, the style of the lettering and the archaeological context of the stone. In the realms of circumstantial dating evidence, the political, military and religious contexts of the second and third centuries in the British provinces are relevant considerations, as are the religious attitudes and policy of central government and in particular those of the imperial family. The question of date is of course inseparable from the consideration of the many various and problematic religious inferences possible from this important dedication which are central to, and justification for. this reassessment. In this respect, and as regards the exact dating of this document, the archaeological context adds little. On the grounds of the</page><page sequence="4">THE ALTAR OF IULIUS APOLINAR1S AT CORBRIDGE 319 form of the lettering, P. Merlat, with regard to the two attested probable periods of occupation by the Sixth Legion (see below), prefers an early third century date (2). Legio VI Victrix at Corstopitum (Corbridge) The epigraphic evidence conveys the impression that one or more vexillations of the Sixth Legion were in garrison at Corbridge for a considerable period ; tombstones and building dedications, besides the religious offerings, indicate permanence (3). However, probability aside, a vexillation's presence is attested with certainty at a particular time by only one dedication, that to Sol Invictus, dated to the governorship of Calpurnius Agricola and so to 163 to 166 (4). However, two building dedications render a presence by the Sixth Legion for some of the years 197 to 210 beyond doubt (5), whilst the Concordia dedication by this legion reinforces this conclusion by virtue of the similarity of this tablet's style to another naming Virius Lupus as governor (197 to about 202) (6). Generai. Remarks on the Political Context of Apolinaris' Altar N. Jolliffe has suggested that an officially Romanised cult of Brigantia is associable with the reorganization of the province, and in particular of the Brigantian state, during the reigns of Septimius Severus and his sons, and consequent on the triumph of Septimius in the civil war with the governor of Britain, Clodius Albinus. This view, with that of a "deliberate identification of Brigantia with the person of the empress" (as Caelestis) has been restated recently (7). The upheaval consequent on Albinus' expedition involved widespread destruction in the Pennine area, which may even have included the (2) Merlat, p. 267, note 2. (3) Tombstones : R IB, 1175, 1190(?).

MARWOOD fortress at York (in which command Corstopitum would have been) : the years following the victory at Lugdunum in 197 saw the beginning of recovery and rebuilding in the area. The evidence for rebuilding at Corbridge has been referred to, and, whatever its exact function in the next two decades, the archaeological and epigraphic evidence together with the military circumstances prevailing leaves us in no doubt of the continuing and perhaps enhanced importance of Corbridge (at the junction of Dere Street and the Stanegate and where the former would have crossed the River Tyne) in the Seveřan scheme and not least in the context of the campaigns in Scotland (208 to 211). At an unknown date in the third century, but perhaps rather later than this, the defences of the cantonal capital of the Brigantes, now Aid- borough, are replaced in stone, and York, already the headquarters of the Sixth Legion, importantly, receives colonial status (perhaps in connection with the imperial presence, 208 to 211) and, on the settlement of the problematic division of the province of Britain, becomes the seat of the governor, ex officio the legate of the Sixth Legion, of the new praetorian province of Britannia Inferior (8). At the end of her important study of the cult of the goddess Brigantia, Jolliffe suggested that it may have been official policy to propagate a Romanised cult of Brigantia, perhaps now adopted as the guardian deity of the new colony, from a Brigantian centre throughout the whole of the new province to promote the process of Romanisation and provide a focus for loyalty to the new administration (9). If that centre was York, then this would have been a likely place for Iulius Apolinaris, as a centurion of the Sixth Legion to have encountered the cult, and we may note that the mural crown, the usual attribute of the tyche-fortuna of a city, is worn by the genius on our altar and by the goddess herself in the fine Birrens relief 0°). In passing we may note the possibility that when the defeated Sixth Legion was sent back from Gaul it was with a leavening of Septimius' own trusted officers (") : could Apolinaris be one (8) B. R.

If so he would surely have been especially understanding of any official policy to foster the cult of Brigantia. A parallel development occurred on the Danube frontier where Noreia, originally a local deity, became the tutelary deity of the province of Noricum, and indeed Caelestis had earlier spread throughout North Africa from Carthage, with which, by the time of Septimius, she was synonymous (12). Both these cults became associated to some degree with the imperial cult. Noreia became Augusti (or Augusta), was associated with Roman deities (including Victoria) and was honoured by imperial officials, including procurators, as well as by natives (13). The idea of Brigantia's official promotion is strengthened by the Seveřan dates of the three datable dedications (of 208, 212 to 217 and c. 210) (14). Furthermore, the deity is honoured in the Roman cult form and the use of dea (deus in the case of Bregans/ Bregantes, perhaps the male form) on six of the dedications, is taken to indicate a Romanised Celtic culti15). Indeed, two of these associate Brigantia with Victoria, an important imperial abstract deity (16). Moreover, apart from the two Celtic dedicants (17) and the three imperial officials (the procurator Nigrinus, Apolinaris and the, presumably legionary, architectus , Amandus) (18), three of the dedicants are perhaps recently, if not very recently, created citizens - all three are Aurelii (19). Lastly, but importantly, two of the texts overtly link Brigantia with the imperial cult through the imperial numen (numina at Greetland) while the Brampton altar, perhaps not surprisingly, has the familiar "devoted to his numen and majesty" (Caracalla s) (20).

MARWOOD However, it is at least notable that none of the eight dedications looks intrinsically the result of an official act : even the Brampton dedication by the procurator, M. Cocceius Nigrinus, is in fulfilment of a vow. In connection with this altar, which is dedicated deae nymphae brig(antiae) "for the welfare and safety" of Caracalla and all the divine household, Jolliffe recalls Caracallas concern, especially in 213, with the propitiation of healing deities ; included among these, according to the obviously incomplete list supplied by Cassius Dio, was, notably for us, Grannus, a Celtic god syncretistically conflated with Apollo and worshipped in Germany - where the emperor was campaigning in the same year (21). Whether or not Apolinaris was himself a priest of Dolichenus, as his name may indicate (22), and whether or not the iussu dei indicates an incubatio (and hence a personal communication with Dolichenus as a healing deity) (23), this officer, or the priests who advised him on the appropriate offerings for his situation, would have been aware of any political desirability of promoting one or more of the cults involved or would have been susceptible to the propaganda of central government in this respect. Perhaps, as E. Birley has suggested, a more likely occasion for the Brampton dedication is that of the thanksgiving, which we can assume was officially prompted, consequent on the receipt of the news of Caracalla's supposed deliverance after the murder of his brother and co- tei) Jolliffe, p. 58 ; Cassius Dio, Roman History , LXXVIII, 15, 5-7 : "For even while abroad he sent to them prayers, sacrifices and votive offerings, and many couriers ran hither and thither every day carrying something of the kind" : E. Carey, Dio's Roman History , IX ( The Loeb Classical Library ), London and New York, 1927, p. 319. Caracalla is in Britain until late 211. (22) Speidel, p. 22, 46 ; as occurred in the Dolichene cult, Apolinaris may have adopted his cognomen , possibly as a professional priestly name. Apollo was an important member of the Dolichene pantheon (Speidel, p. 21-24 ; Merlat, p. 190-192) and this seems to be attested for the Corbridge cult by a fragmentary relief frieze (Speidel, p. 33-34 and plate IV ; Richmond, p. 181-186). It has now been established that serving soldiers could be priests of Dolichenus : Speidel, p. 46-54. Of the three other instances (all civilians) where ApoKDinaris is the name of the dedicant, two certainly (Merlat, p. 53, nr. 55 of A.D. 193 and p. 171, nr. 190) and the third probably (Merlat, p. 56, nr. 62, p. 58-59, nrs. 63 and 64) were priests. This last man was from Commagene : moreover, the priests were frequently of oriental origin : Merlat, Essai , p. 194 and note 9. Merlat considered the name ApoKDinaris to be indicative of a Graeco-oriental origin : Merlat, p. 171, 267 and note 3 ; Merlat, Essai , p. 15. The analysis of I. Kajanto must now qualify this view, the name being a genuine latin form : The Latin Cognomina , Helsinki, 1965, p. 20, 53-55, 107.

Whatever the immediate inspiration or occasion for the erection of the Brampton altar this need not compromise the idea of the culťs official promotion generally "as the personification of the local area and its place in the imperial scheme of things" (25). I. A. Richmond contributed the idea that the assimilation of Caelestis- Brigantia to the Dolichene cult may well have been "nicely calculated to attract men of the Sixth Legion in whose sphere of operations the cult of Caelestis Brigantia had been developed" (26). This point has been more recently reinforced by Merlat in his corpus of Dolichene monuments (27) and it perpetuates the view that Dolichenus was served by a priesthood whose missionary zeal and need for a livelihood led them to the deliberate assimilation of deities into the Dolichene pantheon in order that "every devotee might find a familiar figure" therein. This view has now been firmly challenged by M. P. Speidel, who, whilst noting that the syncretism manifested on our altar "may have made it easier for some men of the British Sixth Legion to feel at home in the Dolichene cult", argues convincingly that "aside from the goddess Salus, invoked here no doubt for personal reasons, and from the local aspect given to luno Dolichena (Caelestis Brigantia), there is no evidence that the priests of Dolichenus added gods at random to the cult just to attract worshippers" (my parentheses). Speidel prefers, justifiably, not to assume that soldiers were "lured into meaningless beliefs by clever advertising tricks of oriental priests", but rather that "the rich yet recurrent, and therefore doctrinally meaningful circle of gods as evidenced at Rome, Heddernheim, Corstopitum and elsewhere must be taken to express for the soldiers the tenets of the Dolichene cult - proof that they were attracted by the cult s rich intellectual life" (28). The Deities and their Epithets Aeternus expresses the cosmic and supreme character of Dolichenus who, in common with other Syrian ba'als, was originally and essentially a (24) Quoted in RIB, 2066 ; several inscriptions are known that were set up in 213 throughout the north of Britain apparently as part of an officially orchestrated affirmation of loyalty by the army, perhaps following unrest after news of the murder ; Frere, op. cit.

The connection between eternity and the heavens was explained by Merlat ; Dolichenus is a god of the heavens whose revolution is manifestly immutable and eternal and therefore Dolichenus is also eternal. The use of the epithet aetemus would seem to express the feelings of the devotees of Dolichenus, in this case Apolinaris, that the deity is a supreme one and Merlat suggests that its presence may also be a symptom of the syncretism which the Dolichene cult epitomises (29). The Sun and Moon, members of the Dolichene pantheon, indicate eternity and the passing of time (30) and may be symbolised on the Corbridge altar. The perception is perhaps best expressed in a dedication from the Aventine Dolicheneum at Rome : "... to Jove, the Best, the Greatest, Dolichenus, the Eternal Preserver of the Whole Sky, Pre-eminent Godhead, Unconquered Provider ..." (31). Caelestis , as an epithet, though perhaps expressing in essence what aetemus does, in the Apolinaris dedication has a greater significance as it is probable that Caelestis Brigantia represents the syncretistic conflation of at least two deities. It has been generally held that caelestis directly or indirectly represents Dea Caelestis or luno Caelestis, the Roman interpretation of Tanit-Pene- Baal ("face of god"), the Punic goddess of the moon, fertility and healing among many other functions of a mother goddess including, perhaps, that of virgin warrior. The equivalent of Roman luno Regina and thought of by the Greeks (at least in one of her aspects) as Aphrodite "Urania" ("the heavenly"), she probably derives from the Elat/ Asherat of the Phoenician pantheon recorded in the fourteenth century B.C. Ras Shamra tablets, rather than from Astarte, the Phoenician fertility goddess (as is some- times assumed). Herewith, significantly for us, is an original connection both with Eshmoun of Sidon, god of medicine, who under Hellenistic influence became assimilated to the Greek (and hence Roman) Asklepios, as well as with Atargatis interpreted by the Romans as Dea Syria. As Aesculapius, the former is associated in Africa and elsewhere with Caelestis : Atargatis represents a fusion of Anat and Ashtart, two members of the ancient Phoenician pantheon (32). Taniťs cult (her name (29) Merlat, p. 266 and note 3. (30) Speidel, p. 27. (31) Merlat, p. 192, nr. 200. (32) G. C.

The Romanised Dea Caelestis had achieved widespread popularity (as well as at Rome) by the time Septimius commemorated her on his coins (34). Richmond regards Caelestis Brigantia as the local aspect of luno Caelestis, the equivalent of Dea Syria, the Romanised Atargatis. Hence, he regards an early third century date probable on the grounds of both the affinity between luno Caelestis and Brigantia and, more particularly, the development of this affinity "in loyal compliment to the Afro-Syrian dynasty of Severus and in particular to Iulia Domna" (35). The only unequivocal evidence of the worship of the empress as Caelestis Dea is the dedication from Mainz : [iuliae augustae] caelesti deae ... (36). E. and J. R. Harris, in their account of the Corbridge altar, and R. P. Wright in RIB (1791), accept the assimilation of Caelestis with Dea Syria which the metrical "creed" from Carvoran inscribed by the tribune Donatianus (whose name strongly implies an African origin) seems to put beyond doubt (37). This remarkable but undated inscription has also been assumed to imply the identification of Caelestis with Iulia Domna, a view which has since been challenged (38). Whether or not I. Miindle is justified in denying the necessity of this identification, and whatever political initiatives may, if any, have officially encouraged the association of ruler-worship with the cult of cosmic deities, a dedication (undated but assignable to the early third century) at Apulum to "Caelestis Augusta, Aesculapius Augustus and the two genii of Carthage and of the Dacias", set up by a legionary legate under a joint reign, reinforces the impression of an association between Caelestis and the imperial cult. Our assumption of the legate's Carthaginian origin, made on the basis of his choice of deities, is supported by the spelling of his name (39). Miindle may, however, be methodologically right to deny on present evidence any imperial patronage of the Caelestis-cult before the official importation of Caelestis (33) As note 32 and Birley, Deities , under 8b.

MARWOOD to Rome and her 'marriage' to the sun-god Elagabalus by the emperor of that name (40). The identification of Caelestis with the Dea Syria (Atargatis) has been confirmed by a recently discovered dedication at Alba Iulia near Apulum ; erected by a priest of Dolichenus in honour of "Iupiter Optimus Maximus Dolichenus and the Dea Syria Magna Caelestis for the perpetual welfare of the Roman empire and the Thirteenth Legion", this altar, significantly for us, shows that the Dea Syria and Caelestis can be equated with the consort of Iupiter Dolichenus, otherwise luno Regina (Dolichena) (4I). This discovery strengthens the suggestion of Merlat that the combination of Caelestis with Brigantia is designed to elevate the latter to the level of a cosmic deity to render her associable on equal terms with Dolichenus (42). Whilst not reaching this conclusion (in 1941 ) Jollifife suggested, and in this was followed by Richmond, that the combination represents propaganda for the imperial cult, and both these scholars regarded the fine Birrens relief as proof of the equation of Caelestis with Brigantia through the medium of Minerva Victrix explicable as the warrior aspect of Tanit- Caelestis (43). In the context of the highly allegorical Birrens relief, it is notable for us that Minerva is a special protectress of Iulia Domna, whilst the goddess's wings may perhaps allude to Septimius' recent or even current successes in Scotland (44). Picard, however, argues against any connection between Minerva and Caelestis in an African context (4S). If Apolinaris were of Graeco-oriental origin (see note 22), then this would perhaps suggest that his conception of Caelestis was chiefly, if not only, as Dea Syria (perhaps, as at Mainz, assimilated to the Syrian Iulia Domna) rather than as Tanit : although, for this to be so, we would have to assume the unity of the inscription and that a re-dedication has not taken place (see above and figure).

Sponsorship of the Cui.t of Doi.ichenus Of the twenty certain or probable dedications to Dolichenus found so far in Britain all but that from Caerleon belong to the northern frontier, most of these are from the Hadrian's Wall zone, and only five are datable within a useful time-span with certainty. These dedications imply that the Corbridge inscription is likely to date to the period from the reign of Antoninus Pius to that of Caracalla, but that it could quite possibly belong to the period up to the reign of Maximinus Thrax (235 to 238) (46). The Dolichene evidence from the empire as a whole is consistent with this time-span whilst permitting a date in the reign of Hadrian and even into the second half of the third century (47). However, technically possible dates aside, all the factors bearing directly on the date of this altar imply a date in the last years of the second century or in the first three decades of the third century : the circumstantial evidence - political, religious and military - favours a date in the early years of the third century, though a later one is still possible. In the light of Speidel's analysis we must now beware of any ready acceptance of the theory that any emperors "and in particular the Syrian- African house of the Severi publically propagated the Dolichene cult" (48). The cult did indeed reach a zenith in popularity under the Severi (though it was already flourishing under Commodus), but no emperor's reaction to it is documented, and the epigraphic evidence does not warrant the assumption of a planned imperial policy (49). Common Aspects of the Deities The deities have in common the attributes of universal and personal tutelary deities and those of healing deities : Dolichenus and Caelestis as part of their natures as supreme and cosmic deities ; and Brigantia, whether as the local aspect of Caelestis or simply as the tyche-fortuna of the Brigantes, is essentially a tutelary deity. Salus, who perhaps is here (46) RIB, 320, 1330, 895 (restored), 1022, 1896 (restored); Merlat, p. 262-275; Harris, p. 56-73 ; Birley, Deities, under 8h.

MARWOOD most closely to be connected with the fruits of the harvest as symbolized by the cupid and the genius (50), can be variously : Salus Publica, deity of the overall well-being of the Roman state ; Salus Augusti (/Augusta), more closely identified with the person of the emperor ; or her more restricted aspect as the guardian of good health, equivalent to, if not the Romanised version of, the Greek Hygieia, the associate of Aesculapius. I have remarked above on Caelestis4 association with Eshmoun-Aescula- pius in North Africa and elsewhere (51). Our perception of Caelestis and Brigantia as healing deities is strengthened by the probable assimilation of both to Minerva (as expressed in the Birrens relief) for whom there is considerable evidence in the north of England attesting her connection, and therefore by association that of Brigantia, with a healing cult (52) : the latter is directly so attested by the form of address "goddess-nymph Brigantia" on the Brampton altar which indicates that here anyway Brigantia is "essentially a water-goddess and therefore a goddess of healing", a function which, interestingly, Salus appears to have fulfilled in parts of Spain (see below). An interesting alternative interpretation of the cupid with grapes is that of a representation of the unhealthy season of autumn (53). The Role of Salus in Religious Dedications The order of the deities on the Corbridge altar need not imply anything about the role of Salus : it may be that she is included by Apolinaris, whose name may hint at a Graeco-oriental origin, out of deference to the religion of both the state and the army of which he was an important member. It was perhaps too readily assumed by I. A. Richmond that Salus-Hygieia is necessarily indicated here (54). A review of the epigraphic evidence provides no sure justification for our excluding the possibility that Apolinaris perceived her either as Salus Publica, the state deity commemorated in the "Acts of the Arval Brethren" where she ranks closely behind the Capitoline Triad in importance, and whose cult was (50) Harris, p. 56 note 5 ; Merlat, on the other hand (Merlat, p. 267), sees the genius as the anthropomorphic representation of the fertilizing quality of Dolichenus : the genius may also symbolize Brigantia as a local goddess4.

Regarding specifically the Corbridge dedication the case has now been reinforced by the discovery of a joint dedication to Iupiter Dolichenus and Salus Augusti (/Augusta) by an auxiliary officer in Pannonia (see below).

MARWOOD Aesculapius) there are at least thirty-eight inscriptions where no qualification or epithet is attached to Salus. However, at least twenty of these are from Spain in parts of which, it seems likely that an indigenous deity was thus addressed in the guise of the appropriate Roman deity (62). Here, especially in Lusitania, Salus seems to have become a water-goddess or genius of wells or springs, which, similarly in the north of England were often associated, in the Roman period, and doubtless before, with healing cults (63). Obviously, the form of an inscription and other circumstantial evidence can indicate, more or less strongly, which particular aspect of the deity, if any, was perceived by the person or group responsible for the inscription concerned (which need not be in every instance a cult-offering) (64). Salus is among the twenty deities honoured regularly by the Equités Singulares Augusti as attested by the presently known (forty-nine) religious inscriptions erected by members of this unit found, for the most part, on or near the side of their pre-Severan barracks on the Caelian Hill at Rome. Within this remarkable body of dedications, dating overall from (62) Such as : Ricardo Hurtado de San Antonio, Corpus provincial de inscripciones latinas, Cáceres (Diputación provincial de Cáceres, servicios culturales), Cáceres, 1977, numbers : 63 (saluti valeria privata lavs) and 64, Baños de Montemayor ; 290, Ibahernando ; 322, Madrigalejo ( = C/¿, II, 653) ; 357 (saluti vicinia caperensis ), Oliva de Plasencia ( = C/¿, II, 806); 447, Santa Ana; 592, Valencia de Alcántara; 336, Montánchez ; 510, Torreorgaz (?) ; all in Conventus Emeritensis, Hispania Lusitania ; J.

Tullius Cratippus as Sacerdos Romae et Salutis (probably in office in the 30s or 20s B.C.) at Pergamon (CIL, III, 399) which must imply S. Publica as must the much- restored dedication (of A.D. 211) of the slave or freedman Hermes from the island of Brattia (Brač), Dalmatia (CIL , III, 1 0 1 09), whose form owes much to that of the records of the Arval Brothers ; and three dedications erected by imperial procurators : that from Sarmizegetusa, Dacia Apul. (Roumania), of A.D. 253-259 (AE , 1933, 13) whose extensive deity-list includes Salus, Hyg(ie)ia and Aesculapius ; that from Napoca, Dacia Porol. (Cluj, Roumania), of the early third century, to Salus alone (AE , 1974, 544) ; and that from Forum Claudii Vallensium, Alpes Atretianae et Poeninae (Martigny, Switzerland), also to Salus alone, dating from a joint reign, probably that of A.D. 161-169 (Marcus and Verus), and erected in association with the town's inhabitants (G. Walser, Römische Inschriften in der Schweitz , III (Verlag Paul Haupt), Bern, 1979, nr. 271). There is no need to identify Salus-Hygieia on any of these three, and at Sarmizegetusa and Martigny S. Augusti or S. Publica are inherently preferable.</page><page sequence="16">THE ALTAR OF IULIUS APOLINARIS AT CORBRIDGE 331 the period A.D. 1 18 to A.D. 250, there is a strikingly formalized group, essentially numbering fourteen, dating from the years A.D. 1 18 to A.D. 143 (65), all of which are altars celebrating the receipt of the honourable discharge and represent the fulfilment of vows. Of these altars all except one (66) are corporate dedications by several or many men (67), and all but three (68) are dedicated to not less than nine specifically named deities (whether singular or plural names) (69) ; Salus is honoured on all of this latter quite distinct group (of eleven) (70). Salus is included in two other dedications, on marble cippi (as opposed to altars), one circumstantially dated to about A.D. 130 (71), the other of a more uncertain, but second century, date (72), which share some of the essential characteristics of the eleven : however, they represent the fulfilment of vows of individuals and do not celebrate the honourable discharge. Both men are officers and one, P. Aelius Lucius, has certainly been transferred to the Seventh Legion Gemina (73). This is not the place for anything but the briefest of comments on these thirteen dedications including Salus (74). The deities include : the great state deities and some of the lesser ones whose cults are not known to have been prescribed for the army (75) ; the Genius of the Emperor and (65) C/L, VI, 31138-31151. (66) CIL , VI, 3 1 1 39 (A.D. 1 28) of M. Ulpius Tertius alone, which is also anomalous in its arrangement. (67) CIL , VI, 31138 (A.D. 118) appears in several ways to be prototypical ; also, uniquely, it does not name those receiving the discharge. (68) C/L, VI, 31147 (A.D. 139), 31150 (A.D. 142), 31151 (A.D. 143): Iupiter O.M., Hercules and Mars only, respectively, are combined with the Genius of the Emperor (Antoninus Pius). (69) One has nine, 31 138 of A.D. 118, the earliest : after this the minimum is fifteen deities on 3 1 1 44 of A.D. 1 36 ; the latest in this group, 3 1 1 49 of A.D. 141, bears the unique maximum of twenty. (70) Thus: 31138-31146, 31148, 31149. (71) C/L, VI, 31174 ; Speidel 1965, p. 102, 104 ; G. L. Cheesman, Journal of Roman Studies, 4(1914), p. 15-16.

In contrast to the series of fourteen, neither of these cippi has either a consular or calendar date. (73) In Hisp.

MARWOOD that of the Equités Singulares ; and other deities of special significance for the unit as mounted-troops, Epona and the Campestres, Celtic in origin, now "naturalized" Roman deities worshipped widely among the armies of the west (76). Also included are deities deriving from the unit's recruiting areas : the Matres and Suleviae from the north-west (especially Britain and Germany) and Silvanus, Apollo and Diana, concealing in Roman guise native deities of Illyricum and Thrace ("). There is considerable scope for debate as to the status of the dedications in relation to official military religious practice (78). In each of the thirteen dedications discussed above, Salus is in close proximity to Felicitas (Publica) and the Fata ; indeed ten of these have them in the order Felicitas-Salus-Fata, and only once are the three separated (79). Study of the inscriptions leaves no doubt that Salus, as has been observed (80), is here to be interpreted as Salus Publica. Apart from this remarkable group there are eight remaining military dedications. The altar from Caerleon, South Wales (Isca, Britannia), dated circumstantially to A.D. 198 to A.D. 209, which is the gift of P. Sallienus Thalamus (from Hadria, Italy), Prefect of the Second Legion Augusta, and his sons, bears the unique 'Salus Regina' and so is problematic ("). Salus Augusti is unambiguously implied as the deity included in the dedication inscribed on the pillar found near Bonn, on the opposite side of the Rhine ( Germania Inferior), bearing the date 229 or that of 23 1 , where she follows Jupiter Propugnator and Victoria ; here she is Salus of the emperor (Severus Alexander), his mother, the army and the imperial ("divine") household, all ponderously expressed and in the genetive. The stone was erected in the name of the First Legion Minervia with its associated auxiliary regiments, by the legionary legate acting under the authority of the provincial governor (82).

Dated circumstantially and plausibly to the late second century or to the first third of the third (84), it is dedicated to Iupiter Dolichenus and Salus Augusti (or Augusta). With the possible exception of an altar erected by two freedmen in the same place which is tentatively restored as dedicated to the same two deities, partly by inference from the decuriones inscription (85), this is the only dedication attesting this combination other than that of Apolinaris at Corbridge. The inscriptions found at Rome, Binchester (England : Roman Vinovia), Ammán (Jordan : Philadelphia/ Arabia), Apulum (Dacia Apu- lensis ; Roumania) and Obernburg (West Germany : Nemaninga/ Germania Superior) leave, respectively, little or no doubt that Salus- Hygieia is envisaged. The dedications from Rome, Binchester and Obern- burg are those of army doctors {medici). Whilst five out of the eight dedications under review include Aesculapius (Asclepius at Rome), those from Rome, Binchester and Amman are to Aesculapius and Salus only, with that from Rome, which is the gift (dated A.D. 82) of S. Titius Alexander, medicus of the Fifth Pretorian Cohort, calling her "Salus of Fellow Soldiers" (86). Interestingly, on the Apulum stone and on that from Amman (assuming the restoration salujti is correct), Salus precedes Aesculapius for which order there is no parallel among the civilian dedications (87).

Rubrius Zosimus, medicus cohortis of the Cohors IV Aquitanorum , may originally have begun with the great healers, Apollo and Aesculapius, who now follow Iupiter O.M., apparently added some time later ; Salus is next with Fortuna, logically, completing a dedication fulfilling a vow pro salute of the prefect of the cohort who, presumably, had been nursed through an illness (c. A.D. 162-210?) (89). It is not quite so certain which Salus (assuming sa[lu]ti to be the correct restoration) was in the mind of P. Catius Sabinus, a military tribune of the Thirteenth Legion Gemina, which post he should have held just before A.D. 200 (®°), when in fulfilment of a vow he names Salus fifth on his altar at Apulum, after the Dii Penates, the Lares Militares, the Lar Vialis and Neptune among a remarkable collection of deities connected with luck, general welfare, health, healing and safe-journeying ; as observed above, Salus precedes (A)esculapius with "Fortune the Homebringer" in between them (9I). A review of the epigraphic evidence indicates that it is inappropriate to be categorical about the role of Salus in dedications without corroborating evidence, and it is methodologically preferable to proceed on the assumption that Salus-Hygieia need not have been entirely separate from the descendant of the ancient Roman deity of welfare in the minds of many dedicants, but rather that she was an aspect of her which had developed when a need was perceived for a Roman deity to fulfil the function of Hygieia. An obvious stimulus for this was the official transplantation from Epidaurus to Rome of Asclepius shortly after the epidemic of 293 B.C. (92). By the time of the epidemic of 1 80 B.C. we find restored, the order discourages an identification with Hygieia. I have not reviewed the dedications to Hygieia where she retains her latinized Greek name. (88) RIB, 1028 : M.

Conclusion In this paper I have sought to reopen issues rather than to make definitive statements. The studies of Speidel and Mündle mean that a planned imperial policy, before Elagabalus, of promoting the association of the imperial cult with the cults of cosmic deities, and in particular with those of Caelestis-Tanit-Dea Syria and Iupiter Dolichenus, can no longer be assumed : spontaneous identification by individuals is another matter. The reasons for the assimilation of Caelestis and Brigantia in our inscription, and allegorically at Birrens, and for the connection (the idea of which is still plausible) between the fruition, apparently brief, of the cult of Brigantia under the Severi and the Romanisation, pacification and reorganisation of the Brigantian state, may be less to do with regional official policy than with religious sentiment and with a sincere manifestation of loyalty (without forgetting Caracalla's health-concern and the politic pretences of imperial officials after the murder of Geta). In other words, a spontaneous identification of interests by members of Brigantian communities - Celtic and Roman - is perhaps implied rather than direction and guidance by the imperial household or government, of Iulius Apolinaris, his colleagues and the native provincials "through religious propaganda and allegory and the deliberate identification of Brigantia with the person of the empress (as Caelestis), to identify their aspirations and future welfare with his (Septimius') new imperial dynasty" (my parentheses) (94). Certainly there was at least a spontaneous assimilation of luno Caelestis with the imperial cult (as at Apulum), indeed with Iulia Domna specifically (at Mainz) and with the Dea Syria (at Alba Iulia). Apolinaris' perception of Salus is, ultimately, unfathomable ; Salus Publica, Salus Augusti or Salus-Hygieia, all are possible in this context. The issues concerned could hardly have manifested themselves at a more strategically important place (except perhaps York) than Corstopi- tum. University of Manchester. M. A. Marwood.
