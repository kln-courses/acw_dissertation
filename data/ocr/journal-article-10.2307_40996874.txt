<plain_text><page sequence="1">100 WOISIKA RIDDLES W.A.L.STOKHOF "Why is a raven like a writing-desk?" "Come, we shall have some fun now!" thought Alice. "I'm glad they've begun asking riddles." Alice's Adventures in Wonderland 0. The present pages do not contain much more than a set of data, collected during my stay in Alor and Timor (Nusa Tenggara Timur, East Indonesia) and are meant to be a basis for further, more serious research. In the introduct- ory paragraphs information is given on the Woisika and, in addition, some remarks . on the formal aspect of the Woisika riddle, the riddle occasion, the parties involved and the function of the riddles1. 1. Woisika is one of 13 languages spoken in the Alor archipelago. It is used by a group of approximately 12.000 people in central Alor. From a linguistic point of view twelve of these languages are of interest as belonging to the so-called non-Austronesian or Papuan languages, though ^traces of Austronesian influence are easily demonstrable in leksis and syntax. Whether these languages belong to the so-called Trans-New Guinea Phylum as is suggested by Wurm 1975 remains still to be proved (see Stokhof 1979 and forthcoming a) . Swidden agriculture (rice, maize) figures prominently in the economy of the Woisika in association with chicken, pig and goat raising and intensive gardening around the houses (tubers) . The</page><page sequence="2">378 men hunt throughout the year (deer, wild pigs and smaller game) . Wild fruits and edible fungi are gathered. Fish and shrimps are caught in larger brooks . During one of my visits to the area I was attracted to the riddling games played by juveniles and since I was not able to understand everything in detail I asked my informants to collect some riddles for me. Markus Mailau and Linus Kamengmai supplied me within a few days with a set of more than three hundred riddles and the collection is still increasing. The riddles offered below are the first hundred I obtained. It should be borne in mind that they do not derive from actual riddle sessions but were elicited from informants . 2.1. On riddles and riddling in Indonesia not much seems to be known. In the literature on the subject I did not find any serious observations about riddles in Indonesian or languages spoken in Indonesia. Most recent anthropological and linguistic f ieldstudies do not mention riddles at all. Elli Göngäs Maranda states that "It is in the nature of f minor forms1 that they easily escape the attention of the f ieldworker" (1976:128). This may be true for recent work, but there is a substantial amount of material available in earlier sources from authors who did have a vivid interest in the subject but whose work almost completely escaped the attention of the riddle-scholars/folklorists. Among the more outstanding collections and studies are the ones by: Helfrich 1884 for Bengkulu, Helfrich 1891 for Lampong, Helfrich 1895 for Ser'awai and Besemah, Kreemer 1928 for Aceh, Van Ophuysen 1891/93 for Batak, Sunderman 1905 for Nias, Jacobson 1919 for Simalur, Spiegel 1894, Moekadi 1908, Holwerda 1923 and Kartosoedirdjo 1923 for Madoera,</page><page sequence="3">379 Holle 1861 and 1869 for Sunda, Hupé 1846 for Dajak, Kruyt 1929, Adriani and Kruyt 1912/1914 , Bikker 1934 for Toraja, Fortgens 1928 for Tabaru, Pieters 1922 for Bum, Niemann 1886 for the Alfur(u), Poensen 18 77, Kreemer 1883 and 1886, Winters 1879, Luijnen- berg 1906/7, Roo de la Faile 1933/34, Meyer Ranneft 1893 and 1897, all for Javanese, De Clerq 1870 for Tonsea - to mention a few2. 2.2. The last decades little attention seems to have been given in Indonesia to the publication of what is sometimes paradoxically called the literature of non-literate societies, pre-literate cultures or non-literary languages3, and especially to the "minor forms", such as charms, proverbs, swearings, and, in particular, riddles1*. This in contradiction to neighbouring countries, e.g. Santos 1958 (Tagalog riddles), Evans 1951, 1954 (on Dusun riddles) . Elsewhere (Stokhof 1976) I have ventured the opinion that study of languages and cultures and subsequent dissemination of its results in the form of descrip- tions, text editions as well as more practically orientated materials for textbooks, literacy programs and bilingual education projects, are part of the linguist's responsibilities. This work is, in my view, crucial for it is not illusory that in Indonesia certain languages, literatures and folklores may become in danger of extinction because of the ever growing influence of the national language. But there is yet another, maybe even more urging reason why the study of local languages and cultures should be taken in hand more intensively: this kind of research</page><page sequence="4">380 may eventually contribute to a better mutual understan- ding between ethnic minorities and ethnic majorities, between the periphery and its centre; between rulers and those ruled. 3. The Woisika riddle does not strike me as high literary achievement. But this estimation is, after all, quite an ethnocentric statement influenced by western concepts of literature or ideas of what literature should be. How true this is, appeared during the sessions with the informants where it sometimes happened that what I considered to be trite, dull or of little literary importance, was experienced as fascinating and/or well formulated. It is conspicuous that students of non-western cultures sometimes tend to superimpose schemes on verbal activities on the basis of home-made constructs in which vague aestheticism or functionalism play a role. No harm is done as long as no universalism is implied: there is nothing against fitting phenomena into one typology or another, but we should be aware of the fact that at least the assignment of aesthetic value is highly culture specific. Instead of scholar's personal evaluations attention should rather be paid to how the community itself experiences verbal activities and from what point of view. Schärer 1966, Fox 1971, 1975, Adriani M. and A.C.Kruyt 1912/4 are instances for Indonesia where a first onset of this approach to local literature is demonstrable. Needless to say this approach is only possible after a long and intensive contact with the culture in question. 4. The Woisika know several "minor" and "major" forms of verbal composition / art such as myths, legends, songs, riddles, magical formulas, which they set apart from</page><page sequence="5">381 other verbal activities because of their form and content and/or use and occasion. Needless to say, these forms are an inseparate part of daily life but it is possible to set up a kind of taxonomy with the above features as parameters. They have separate names for all these genres which indicates that they are aware of their different form and content. The Woisika distinguish these activities from other "common" verbal activities in that they show one or more of the following properties : 1. they are used on particular occasions 2 . they are aimed at a particular audience and 3. they are produced by (a) particular (group of) person (s) 4. they are (or consist of) units which show a high degree of semantic and formal cohesion. In myths , ritual songs and magical formulas the form (and to a certain extent also the content) , the producer and the target group are highly predictable since they are conditioned traditionally and occur on special occasions (e.g. death feasts, after hunting parties, etc.) . This distinguishes these activities from the other verbal phenomena characterized by one or more of the above mentioned features: non-ritual songs, anecdotes, proverbs, plays on words / puns and riddles. Songs sung during the ringdances fit into either category depending on what occasion they are performed. 5. The riddle in Woisika, unlike in some other areas in Indonesia, is not restricted to certain periods of the day or the night, or to certain prescribed occasions or periods important in social life such as is the case for instance with the East Toraja of the Bola'ang Mongondow who are allowed to play the riddle-game only</page><page sequence="6">382 during the night vigils over the dead before burial, or the Western Tora ja who do it during the period that the grains come out (Kruyt 1929 , also Potter 1950). Riddling in Woisika does not seem to be subject to any taboo or related to any taboo whatsoever. Whereas magical formulas, ceremonial songs and, quite clearly, nursery songs may all be seen as verbal warding off of unknown entities, I did not find any evidence for this hypothesis in the case of the Woisika riddles. 6. There are no formal age groups in Woisika. Generally speaking any child from 4 up until 12-14 years (for females) and 14-16 years (for males) is called /'dum moK/ 'little child'5, or /'dum moK ma 'le/ 'little girl' and /'dum moK lam/ 'little boy1, /dum/ being the general word for 'child'. Girls are considered nubile from 14-16 years onward depending on the physical development of the person in question and are then called /ma 'le fon/ 'young female, virgin'. For boys this moment falls some- what later, i.e. between 16 and 18 years. They are called then /'lam lu 'tel/ 'young male'. It is exactly in this formal peer group where riddling is attested, i.e. the unmarried female and male individuals in their puberty and early adulthood. Their tendency towards riddling set them apart from the /'dum moK/ as well as from the older married people /lam ma 'le sâK/ . Interest in riddling normally ceases after marriage. Adults regard riddling as a diversion primarily appropriate to the young: a pastime or funny play sometimes full of criticisms and at times somewhat bawdy. „It may be played wherever and whenever two (or more) adolescents feel like it: on the way to school or to the gardens, or on the way homeward, during picnics, on moonlit nights before going to sleep, after a succesful hunting day.</page><page sequence="7">383 Riddling especially occurs during the long evenings when there is not much to be done for them apart from the occasional ringdances (Woisika /pi "Ian/ Kupang Malay lego-lego) and listening to the discussion of the adults . A starts propounding a riddle and B answers. When two groups are competing B may ask advice from his team- members. It is allowed to reply several times until the right solution is given. If B is not able to solve the problem he gives up and will then in turn challenge A. This goes on until everybody (in case of group competition) has got his turn to answer as well as to question. Winner is of course the individual / group who / which has solved most riddles. The loser has to pay the reward which has been agreed upon before the play started; usually a piece of sugar cane, some fresh shrimps caught during the preparations for the picnic, a handful of kenari nuts (Canarium commune) or a part of the game after the kill has been divided. 7. The way in which the riddle is formulated is important. If the opponent (s) do (es) not agree upon the formulation of the riddle which may have been misleading, e.g. not in accordance with the traditional forms and imagery and thus a possible reason for the opponent's failure, the contestant (s) could come to blows. Sometimes different solutions are allowed by the riddler, e.g. riddle no. 66 where f civet1 as well as 'cat' are accepted as correct answers, but it also occurs that the poser rejects the solver's answer since it is not the expected solution. The present author experimented during the interviews with what he considered to be perfectly suitable answers but not one solution was accepted. The</page><page sequence="8">384 informants simply did not see the analogy between riddle image (see par. 10) and the alternatives offered. This proves for Woisika that the relation between the kernel and the expected solution is traditionally determined. This observation was corroborated conversely by the fact that sometimes the fit between problem and solution had to be explained to the author: riddling is a highly culture specific phenomenon (see also par. 9) . The older people and those recently married often like to listen but do not participate in the play itself. They restrict themselves to slightly derisive remarks about the simplicity of the riddles6. In general, an audience is often very stimulating for the contestants since the riddles and their solution are overtly and immediately evaluated, commented upon and teasing remarks and admiring exclamations often abound. A positive reaction is mostly expressed by laughter shared by all those present. Most riddles are traditional, i.e. they are orally transmitted from one age group to an other. The /'dum moK/ are often present at riddle plays and although they do not tend to participate until they are accepted in the group (on the basis of physical criteria / age(?)) they obtain of course their own stock of riddles and automatically learn how to pose them. The Woisika possess an unlimited set of riddles, although quite limited in form, imagery and theme. Many riddles are just different renditions of the same problem and are well known to the whole community. Thematic innovations occur, see e.g. riddles no. 7, 78, 82, 88, and 92. The riddles do not imply a special (group limited) knowledge; they are not secret or even private lore . Since the riddles presented here result from male informants I have not been able to find out whether</page><page sequence="9">385 boys and girls show a different appreciation of / or preference for certain riddles7. 8. The question of what part the riddle plays in the community and what is the attitude towards it has to be answered as follows: As stated in par. 6 the (married) adults take cognizance of the phenomenon, and nobody is inclined to see in riddling more than a pleasant diversion. However since riddling is characteristic of a limited group of individuals who all share the feature that they are (about to be) accepted as adults by their community and who recently attained their sexual maturity, I am convinced that there is more involved than entertainment only. Of course, it is a kind of contest: creativity in formulation and acuteness of apprehension guarantees success for riddler as well as for the riddlee. But apart from this training in verbal play, sharpening of the wit, development of competitive feelings and transfer of knowledge / experience, it is to my mind, first and foremost an informal way of social intercourse, a first verbal reconnoitering, a legitimate occasion for flirting which eventually results in courting. Moreover, riddling sessions are at least partly a kind of substitute for physical activity for the marriageable boys and girls originating from separate clans whose physical contacts are strictly controlled by the exogameous patrilineal and predominantly virilocal Woisika. But in addition I am inclined to see the riddling contests as remnants of reported but now obsolete initiation ceremonies, a kind of self imposed extended rite de passage, characteristic of the tran- sitory stage in which they find themselves: the social and physical puberty8.</page><page sequence="10">386 9. Not all events of life seem to function as theme for riddles in Woisika nor did I find all sorts of enigmas known from the literature. I did not encounter onomatopoeic riddles as reported for some African cultures (Dupire and De Tressan 1955, Arnott 1957) nor wordless riddles . The following themes were not attested: 1. actual events (data on things just happened) 2. eschatological and transcendental themes 3. traditional themes (data on clan origin, itineraries of ancestors, warfare, etc.) 4 . themes on neighboring peoples or governmental and religious leaders. How and what people think about things, events, etc. is partly related to a shared set of similar experiences they have had as members of the same ethnic and/or linguistic group. Riddling is only possible when there is such a set of shared experiences. Although the riddles do not cover all important aspects of Woisika life, the choice of the themes and the properties focussed on in the riddles gives and outsider an impression of certain priorities in Woisika life. Moreover, they may eventually help us to obtain an insight into the differences in ways of perceiving and thinking between outsiders and the Woisika. Using Schapera's system as adapted by Glazier and Glazier 1976 as starting point, the range of themes seems to be limited to nine domains. Table 1 shows the distribution of the themes (as formulated in the accepted solutions) expressed as a percentage of the total number of available riddles (300) :</page><page sequence="11">387 % 1. Animal world 35 2. Human body and its functions 17 3. Utensils and other objects 16 4. Natural phenomena 11 5. Crops and other foods 10 6 . Vegetable world 7 7. European culture 3 8. Domestic and subsistence 0,5 activities 9. Abstract ideas 10. Ill advised and impossible acts 0,5 Table 1: themes used in riddling 10.1. In Woisika the word /'tawaV (from the verb /'taU/ 'to establish, to determine; to understand1) means 'invented story', i.e. something which is not true, and it is often translated by Woisika informants into Indonesian as dongeng 'tale' or teka-teki 'riddle'. The word is distinguished from /a 'ten laK/ 'true story1. The Woisika riddle is an independent communicative unit. In general its model consists of two basic elements: 1. problem and 2. solution. The problem comprises: 1.1. Introductory formula (optional) 1.2. Kernel (presenting the riddle image) which usually has two elements: 1.2.1. riddle subject (= the constituent on which the attention of the riddlee is f ocussed) 1.2.2. riddle predicate (= what is stated about the riddle subject) 1.3. Final formulas Example: riddle 53</page><page sequence="12">388 1 . Problem: 1.1. Introductory 'ne-tawan 'tawa^ noK(-te) fI know a riddle1 formula my+riddle riddle one(+and) 1.2.

Solution ah 'Faeces1 The initial formula is always the same, the final is either interrogative or adhortative. The introduction is obligatory when the riddling begins but facultative as soon as it is clear that what is said is not to be taken at face value. So, during a riddling event, after the first conundra have been lanced, the subsequent ones will usually only be completed with a final formula. The RS is posited on the basis of the solution. The informants did not have any problem in establishing which constituent in the kernel is focused upon. However, the present author often experienced difficulties here since the RP sometimes also contains constituents which could be considered as RS . Moreover it occurs that a constituent which is used as RS in riddle X is part of the RP in riddle Y where it has to be taken at 'face value', i.e. where the referent is a manifestation of the meaning. Compare R24 and R9 (the RSs are underlined) : R24 dum ki'rin noK 'wo-funi-nboko A little child that is impossible to catch (water) vs. R9 dum ki'rin noK ' je-karan-aK i'leh-te si 'lang A little child pulls : his beam up and down (snot)</page><page sequence="13">389 In some cases the RS is not mentioned at all, see par. 12. The RP may be simple or complex: Simple: Riddle no. 53 a child // that frightens adults Complex: Riddle no. 179 a child //■ that does not use his machete to clean the (unirrigated) arable land, but to obtain his food solution: the crocodile (which uses its tail to kill people, ani- mals, etc.) 10.2. Georges and Dundes have proposed topic and comment where I use riddle subject and riddle predicate, respectively. Topic is, however, in linguistic literature often associated with given, that what is known to Speaker and Hearer on the basis of their shared knowledge of situation and context (frame of reference) , whereas comment is viewed as new information. In the riddle kernel all elements represent new information, since the frame of reference is lacking (see par. 11). So, from that point of view there is no given. For that reason, I prefer in my discussion of the Woisika riddles the terms (riddle) subject and (riddle) predicate with the description as given in 10.1. 10.3. The vocabulary used in the riddle is not archaic or what the Woisika would consider 'poetic1 as is some- times the case with the songs sung by the old men during the ritual lego-lego or when they relate about the mythical past. That kind of words which is not always completely understood by the younger people could only create unnecessary misunderstandings when used in riddling.</page><page sequence="14">390 Apart from the repetition in the initial formula, no 'literary1 devices are attested, e.g. I find neither rhythm nor alliteration. Though the place of the stress is relevant in the language on word level it is not used as an artifice. No syllable counting or rhyme or the like has been discovered as in other types of Woisika oral composition. However, the construction of the central part of the conundrum, i.e. the formulation of the problem itself strikes me as very concise. According to L.L.Kamengmai this is especially characteristic of the Ateita area but I have not been able to check this out. 11. It is a well known fact that a successful transmission of a verbal message between two cooperative parties presupposes a relatively high degree of shared knowledge . This knowledge can be mapped into the following subsets: 1 . language 2. cultural categories and their (cognitive) order 3. data relevant to the context (i.e. the (immediate) lingual environment of message) 4. data relevant to the pertinent situation (i.e. extra-lingual environments) 5. paralingual and kinetic data In a 'normal1 act of communication these five kinds of knowledge enable the H to understand speaker's intentions. In riddling the disambiguating function of the frame of reference constituted by 3. and 4. is almost completely missing. The H who is referent oriented in a normal speech situation is left with nothing but what is transmitted by the lingual form per se (its linguistic meaning) . H can not obtain additional data from the preceding or following section of the discourse nor</page><page sequence="15">391 does he possess any actual, directly applicable knowledge to find out what is actually meant by the S. The only information which is available to Woisika riddlee and which belongs to 4. (extra-lingual data) is: a. the conventional signalling devices (i.e. introductory and final formulas characterize the utterance as a riddle) b. the intended referent (i.e. the solution of the riddle) is not a manifestation of the meaning of the sign (i.e. the kernel) c. the referent (s) of the riddle kernel and the intended referent share certain features d. the choice of the riddle subject is limited to certain domains, and e. the imagery used in the formation of the kernel is more or less conventionalized Point b. is, as I see it, the most particular aspect in riddling, especially in the so-called "true riddle" (see below) . The hearer /riddlee knows a priori that what has been said by the speaker/riddler should not be taken at face value. There is a difference between the meaning of the message directed to him and the thing/event meant (the intended referent) . I would like to stress this point because of the contention sometimes found in the literature that the solution (my intended referent) and the riddle subject are identical. See e.g. George and Dundes 1963:114 where they state this for their so-called literal non-oppositional riddles such as, e.g. "my fader has a tree, it bears fruit, outside green and inside white", solution: "coconut". Here not the meanings of 'fruit' and 'coconut' ar-e identical but both utterances refer to the same thing. Harries (1976:324) does not restrict</page><page sequence="16">392 himself to the relation between riddle subject and intended referent but relates the whole kernel (his Precedent) with the intended referent (his Sequent) and states that "the meaning of the riddle lies in the semantic identity shared by both Precedent and Sequent " . As I said above, in my view, riddle subject (or kernel, for that matter) and the intended referent refer to the same thing/event but they are two different (sets of) meanings. The semantic features which converge in the linguistic meaning of a sign are only partly universal features. The linguist in his effort to give a description which covers all admissible referents tries to establish the meanings on the basis of the reactions of his informants at different occasions. He will set up oppositional relationships for the language under investigation. Consequently, his description will be to a certain degree culturally determined since "a natural language reflects a naive vision of the world" (Ebeling 1978:10). However, it will consist of only functional features, not of redundant ones . On the other hand the language user may have different clues at different times for recognizing an utterance as a suitable designation of a given phenomenon. It is incorrect to speak of semantic identity. Take again as example riddle 53 (par. 10) . In this case I can not find any shared semantic (= linguistically relevant) features. The aversion to, or fear for, faeces is not a constituent of the meaning of /ah/. Here two extremely different meanings are matched together on the basis of a culture specific analogy which from a linguistic point of view does not share any distinctive features. In this instance the feature FEAR/AVERSION is</page><page sequence="17">39 3 a distinctive feature in the kernel expressed by the verb but an associative (= not distinctive) feature in the intended referent: the riddlee in his search for the solution / intended referent uses not only semantic features but non-semantic features as well. 12. Many of the conundra presented here belong to what folklorists call the 'true riddle1. This is a composition consisting of a riddle subject plus a riddle predicate and where in the RP the information given about the RS is incompatible with / or contra- dictive to our knowledge of the real world (the so-called block of the riddle) . See the following examples : R273: i'li-K 'wo-ba 'sâra-si (S: 'lanpu' je-Ili) water+this it+make flame+non-past lamp its+water 'This water can be put to fire1 ('petroleum1) R125: i'li-K tarn â-mâ-ra-si (S: 'tama) water+this boil rice+ccoked+become+non-past ('seawater') 'When you boil this water it becomes rice' R159: 'dum noK 'je-wa 'wo-nâ-te gal ' je-ma-lo-nkan (S: ku'me) child one its+foot it+is+not+ it it+goes+for-a- ('snake') but -walk+possible 'This child does not have feet but is perfectly able to walk' R28: a'si-K 'wo-ba ' almakan-da-si (S: ta 'fui la 'ko) faeces+these they-Hnake people+become+non- our+penis liquid past 'These faeces are made human beings' ('sperm') As can be seen from these instances, it sometimes happens that no manifestation of the meaning of a given (set of) sign(s) exists in the real world. It is one of the conventions of riddling that the riddlee accepts this fact and considers what is evoked by the riddle kernel to be a concept/image of something in a fictional world. In fact, many riddle kernels would be rejected by certain linguists as 'unacceptable', 'ungrammatical '</page><page sequence="18">394 or 'unnatural1/ because they are semantically odd or deviant. The same intended referent (IR) can be evoked by different images at different times dependent on what the riddler choses to focus the attention of the riddlee on, e.g. R125 (see above) where the production of salt from seawater is focused on (cooked rice = salt) and R127 (you can play in this water, but drink only a little of it: seawater) where the impossibility to use seawater as drinking water is stressed. Compare also: R32 This little child is able to bind a buffalo RII 8 In this village the people do not have hands or feet but they can go wherever they want R159 See above R132 This waistband can kill people R139 This worm can swallow a pig S : A snake (Python reticulatus) On the other hand, different intended referents may have the same riddle subject (but of course, a different RP) , e.g. RS string / IR cotton, yarn (146) IR pubic hair (178) IR angling line (8) IR worm (196) IR branch of rice panicle (221) IR branch of tree (224) IR thread of cobweb (221) IR eel (235) In some instances the IR of riddle X is used as the RS of riddly Y whose obligatory solution again is similar to the kernel of riddle X: Rl42a P: Mat used to wrap unhusked rice in S : The waves of the sea</page><page sequence="19">395 RI 42b P: The waves of the sea are always rolling S : Mat for wrapping up unhusked rice R150a P: If you throw a stone in this rice-container it directly hits the bottom S : Pond R150b P: If you throw a stone in this pond it hits the bottom S : An empty rice-container Only a few sets of these mirror-images have been encountered. Sometimes two independent riddles are combined into one complex one consisting of two RSs and two RPs : R206a P: Although it is a little child it goes far S : kuT R206b P: It is an adult but he does not walk far S: ka'poran R206C P: When it is far a little child goes, when it is near the adult goes S: kuT (arrow used for long distance) and ka'poran (arrow used for short distance) R234 P: A little child that does not want to enter the village of the adults but the adults want to visit the village of the little child S: shrimps and fishes The RS may coincide with the grammatical subject (Sb) but this is not always the case (the RSs are underlined) : Sb Adv.loc.

Optional cross-referencing independent pronouns occur: ja ~ ga neutral forms: 'he, she, it, they1 gal (slight emphasis), 'gala (def initeness) jên (emphasis) 'it him who', 'jêru (ref lexivity) , 'jera (antithesis), etc. In the riddles often an (non-generic) indefinite noun phrase is used e.g.: 'dum noK' 'a child' which may or may not be followed by one of the many forms of the third person pronoun. The suffix -aK abounds in the material. Elsewhere (Stokhof 1978) I have termed it an anaphoric suffix; it expresses previous knowledge of the speaker, unknown to the hearer. This view is confirmed by the many instances offered in the riddles. In the solutions inalienables often take the t-prefix for generic reference: 'eyes' RIO t-en 'genitals' R27 ' t-al t-a'ful</page><page sequence="22">39 8 'teeth1 R185 t-aeh9 For further details I refer to Stokhof forthcoming b. 13. There is a relationship between RS and IR in Woisika but it is not so obvious that we are abl£ to predict the IR as soon as the RS has been given. 'Table 2 shows that 42% of all RSs are human, only* 2, 7 8 animal and 45/72 non-animate. I cannot explain this tendency to anthropomorphism, though I am aware that it occurs elsewhere too, e.g. Muranda 1976:130 quoting Milner. It is interesting to note that a comparison of all human RSs and their pertinent IRs shows that more than 51% had an animal as its IR. Non-adults are favoured as RS. L.L.Kamengmai suggests that child/little child is often chosen as RS since much of what is told about it may be true: fa child can be ordered to do practically every thing you want (in Woisika society) ' . This statement then implies that child/little child is not more than a dummy, itself not important for the solution of the riddle, but merely the carrier of the properties assigned to it in the RP. This may be partly true, but on the basis of the further explanations given by L.L.Kamengmai I found that: 1. little child often points to an IR which is relatively small, e.g.: eye, needle, star, moon, red pepper, matches, scorpion, worm, bee, faeces, fireflies, 2. child often point to an IR which a. forms a part of a greater whole: clapper and bell hammer and gong arrow and bow pestle and mortar</page><page sequence="23">399 trivet and fireplace poles and granary/clan house feet and body b. is a heavenly body: sun, moon, .star The connection between RS and IR is often based on sensory, functional or behavioural analogy. Examples are: 3. visual analogy: mango/egg worm/snake Piper Betle and fruits from the areca palm (Areca Catechu) /male genitals string/pubic hair string/thread of cobweb beam/snot hanging from nose fence/teeth soldiers /matches 4. auditory analogy: crack (of a rifle) /sound produced by breaking wind sound resulting from frying food/ jingling of coins pattering of the rain/ jingling of ankle bracelets 5. olfactory analogy: stench of a corpse/stench of a ripe Jack fruit {Arto- carpus integri folia) 6. analogy based on taste-bud perception: bitter vs. sweet/salt (water) - fresh (water) bitter water/coffee (a drink) 7. tactile analogy: stone/faeces from a turtle (stonehard when dried) 8. functional analogy: buffalo/horse (both are used for transport) machete/teeth (both cut) house/clothes (both offer protection/enclose house/snail shell animate beings)</page><page sequence="24">400 soldiers/trap (soldiers function as night watch/mouse traps are set at night) door/teeth (both close/block entrance) 9. behavioural analogy: pig/crocodile (both live in mud) 9 . is a good example of a connection based on several different analogies. Asked why a pig was chosen as the RS for a crocodile L.L.Kamengmai answered : 1. both have four short legs (visual) 2. both have a dark skin spattered with mud (visual) 3. both live in mud (behavioural) These instances prove that in Woisika the choice of the RS contributes indeed to the solution of the riddle. However, the poser may prefer not to facilitate the solving and choose riddles where no RS is mentioned at all (9.5% of all riddles do not show a RS) e.g. R241: fmuta-ndar) 'me jâ faflen-si (S: ton i'ten-ta) stink+when carry wrap-up+non-past (S: Jack fruit ripe+ resultative) 'When it stinks then it is buried1 S: A ripe Jack fruit (Artocarpus integri folia; it is eaten (= buried) in spite of its very strong odour) Or only a third person is indicated in the form of an obligatory third person prefix on the verb, e.g.: R26 : kaftë-nkari-te fwo-funi-nboko (S: il) eat+possible+but it+touch+iirpossible (S: water) 'You can eat it but not touch it1</page><page sequence="25">401 types of RS total % I I Lrin-14-e adults ™ën 0,42 2 2'94 4 adults women 2,52 2 2'94 4 | little child 10,92 I non-adults „^ .,.„ fern. child 1,26 22,68 oo CQ 42 „„ -Q A non-adults „^ .,.„ mle child Q^4 22,68 oo CQ 44,78 „„ -Q $ child (gen.) 9,66 | •5 human beings (general) 16,38 x' o 1 animals 2,78 3 x' -HL plants 8,04 r- plants 8,04 r- w h stone 3,40 ;8 house 3,09 TJ a) string 2,78 S water 2,78 I village 1,85 S tree 1,70 45,72 h firewood 1,24 37,68 8 &amp; door 1,24 -H hat 1,24 S skin 1,24 cooked rice 1,24 ball 0,93 mat 0,93 other objects (&lt;0&gt;93) 14,02 | | riddles without RS 9,5 Table 2: relative frequency of RSs as a percentage of the total number of riddles (300) 14.1. w 1.

The investigations were made possible by grants from the Netherlands Foundation for the Advancement of Tropical Research, WOTRO, (Grants W38-7 and W38-22) and sponsored by the Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia (Jakarta) and the Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa (ibidem) . I am grateful to Hein Steinhauer for many helpful comments on the earlier version of this paper. How little is known about riddles and riddling in Indonesia is demonstrated by data from the Human Relations Area Files at Cornell University extracted in 1966 by Roberts and Forman, where apart from "Indonesian" and "Malays" not any local language and/or culture in Indonesia is mentioned. They set up four sets of "cultures". "Cultures" which are reported as 1 .Definitely having riddles: Afgan, Amharic, Apayao, "Arabic", Austrian, Aymara, Bemba, Bhil, Bisayan (central) , Bulgarian, Bush Negro, Callinago, Cambodian, Chagga, "Chinese", Cornish, Cuna, Czechoslovakian, Dard, Dhegiha, Eskimo (central) , Estonian, Fang, Fellahin, (modern) "Formosan", Gondi, Greek, Guj erati, Hausa, Hottentot, Hungarian, Iban, Ila, Indonesian, Iranian, Irish (rural) , Kashmiri, Kikwyu, Kol, Korean, Kurdish, Lapp, Lithuanian, Lovedu, Malays, Maori, Masai, Mayan, (Ycatan) , Mbundu, Mongolian, Ngondi, Ngoni, Nuer, Polish, Rumanian, Rundi, Rwala, Samoan, Serbia, Somalia, Soviet Union, Syrian, Thonga, Tibet, Tiv, Ukrainian, Wolof, Yao, Yakut, and Yugoslavian. 2. Definitely not having riddles: Manus, Miao, Pukapuka. 3. Being indeterminate: Aden, Burmese, Chukchee, Oraqi, Jordanian,</page><page sequence="46">422 Kuwait, Lebanese, Nanane, Nootka, Saudi, Arabian, Thailand, Tuareg, Yemen, and 4. Cultures in which the presence of riddles is unreported: Ainu, Albanian, Aleut, Andamans, Azandi, Aztec, Bahrain Islands, Bambara, Bedouin, Bellacoola, Burusho, Bushman, Caingang, Carib, Caucasian, Cayapa, Choroti, Comanche, Creek, Crow, Delaware, Dorobo, Easter Islands, Eskimo (Copper) , Gandian, Georgian, Goajiro, Gros Ventre, Guana, Hadhramut, Ifugao, Incan, Indian, Iroquois, Jivaro, Kachin, Kamchadal, Kapauku, Katab, Khasi, Koryak, Laotian, Lepha, Lo lo, Luo, Manchurian, Mandan, Marquesas, Massachusetts (historical) , Mende, Micmac, Mongo, Monguer, Montagnais, Mosquito, Mossi, Munduracu, Murgnin, Nambicuara, Navaho, New Ireland, Nupe, Ojibwa, Orokaiva, Paiute (northern) , Papago, Pawnee, Porno, Punjab (east) , Rif , Russian (great) , Samoyed, Semang, Senegal, Seri, Siberian, Sinkiang, Sino- Tibetan border, Shilluk, Sirono, Siwan, Talamanca, Tallensi, Tanala, Tapirape, Tarahumara, Tarsco, Tehuelche, Tepztlan, Tewa, Tikopia, Timpisa, Tiwi, Tlingit, Tubatulabal, Tucuna, Turkestan, Tupinamba, Twi, Utter Pradesh, Yahgan, Yakut, Yoruba, Yuman (plateau) , Yuman (river) , Yurok, Vedda, Wogeo, and Zuni. It is clear that in this enumeration political entities and ethnic entities have been hopelessly mixed up; for instance, what do Indonesian, Soviet Union or Yugoslavian culture mean and why are Serbia and Ukranian mentioned separately? Why use quotation marks for Arabic and Chinese and not for instance for Indian, Indonesian or Soviet Union? Why is Russian (great) mentioned in 4. whereas Soviet Union is given in 1.? Apart from all this, it is demonstrative of the lack of knowledge about the riddle in Indonesia whereas quite a number of materials is available, see the bibliography. Our knowledge of Papuan riddling is very limited. Held 1957 found only a few riddles in Waropen. Boaz 1927 contends that the riddle is rare in amerindian cultures. This is confirmed by Beals c.s. in 1953 l. On the other hand it is a popular entertainment in Africa, e.g. Meyer Fortes 1967, Dupire and Marquis de Tressan 1955, Arnott 1957, Bascom 1949. See Burns 1976 for bibliographical data. For Europe see, e.g. Taylor 1951, Opie and Opie 1959, Evans 1976 fnt.2. 3 Why not call it verbal art or oral composition? This I prefer to the coining of another new term as Adams 1979 does: "telantry is a new word [ ] referring to the language arts which develop to be spoken and listened to, that is, utterances embellished beyond the minimal needs or ordinary discourse, such as myths, legends, tales, poetry, songs, chants, prayers, puns, name jokes, swearing, riddles, and any other special forms. With this new term ( ) we may properly limit the use of the word "literature" to written material". 4 Fortunately, this is rapidly changing: The National Centre for Language Development, Ministery of Education and Culture, Jakarta, has undertaken to publish a large set of recordings of oral</page><page sequence="47">423 literature. See Amran Halim in Rusyana and Raksanagara 1978:V ff. 5 Woisika is written in phonemic transcription as given in Stokhof 1979: supraglottal . .. _ I - i - . - =-i , - i - - . - i - glottal . .. _ labial - . apical , - palatal . - velar w p t k 3 occlusives PT K 1 b 8 taj^^- Tfriíl r nasals m n n io _______________________________ e w fricatives f s £ M X CO - . - , •h o o -p lateral - . - I , ■P ^ e § ãe u ì? centrals w U j I h Consonants /P, T, K, U, 1/ are archiphonemes of /p, b/, /t, d/, /k, g/, /u, w/ and /i, j/, respectively. front central | back lax tense I lax tense high i i u û mid e ê o ô low ae â^ ã ~~^^ao unrounded rounded Vowels Usually the riddle and the solution are given in Woisika followed by a word-for-word English transcription. Woisika morpheme boundaries have been indicated by '+' in the English text. English words which together constitute the meaning of a Woisika morpheme are hyphenated. In addition a free English translation is given, which in § 14. is followed by a free Indonesian translation by L.L.Kamengmai. In the Woisika examples offered in the text the morphemes are separated by a hyphen. (') Indicates the place of the stress.</page><page sequence="48">424 6 Though adults do not participate in riddling, they may sometimes use sophisticated proverblike expressions cognate with the imagery and themes used in riddles. This type of composition is usually resorted to in cautious warnings or mocking innuendos. However, here the traditional introduction and challenae/auestion are absent, of course. See e.g. Hart 1964:124 "youthful Filipinos are apt to recall double-entendre riddles in the presence of young, unmarried ladies to tease or embarrass them", and Menez 1975:139 fnt.14. ° Compare Van Gennep 1960: "rites which accompany every change of place, state, social position and age". I do not find any evidence to regard riddles as "expressive models, or representations, of the serious and even formal interrogation of subordinates by superordinates", as stated by Roberts and Forman (1972:182) though several cultures have been reported to use interrogation techniques in initiation and puberty rites, e.g. for Indonesia: Tehit (Bird's Head, Irian Jaya - personal communication Don A.L. Flassy) . Their interpretation of riddling: "Riddles may be regarded as natural models (as opposed to formal models used in mathematics W.S. ) which represent interrogation ( ) " is trivial. 9 The contradistinction to for instance the Tallensi riddles (Meyer Fortes 1967) which seem often to consist of a very short even monosyllabic question with a more or less elaborated response, the Woisika riddles show the opposite pattern. The solution is often only one word - the question, though tersely formulated, is longer. 10 The riddles given below have not been arranged according to any criteria; they form the first hundred of the collection.
