<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY ANNUAL MEETING, 1965 The 30th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology was held on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, May 6, 7, and 8, 1965, on the campus of the University of Illinois in Urbana. The host for this meeting was the Department of Anthropology of the University of Illinois. Approximately 325 persons registered; actual attendance was over 350. MEETING OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE As required by Article VI, Section 3, of the Constitu- tion of the Society, the annual meeting of the Executive Committee was held prior to the annual business meeting of the Society. An account of this meeting is included in the report of the Secretary. ANNUAL BUSINESS MEETING The annual business meeting was called to order by President Albert C. Spaulding at 4:20 P.M. on Friday, May 7, 1965. About 120 members attended the business session. The reports of the Secretary, Treasurer, and Editor (all printed below) were read and approved by the mem- bers present. The results of the election of officers (909 valid ballots received) were reported by the Elections Committee (David S. Dibble, William T. Field, Jr., and E. Mott Davis, Chairman) as follows: President-Elect, Joe Ben Wheat; Treasurer, Nathalie F. S. Woodbury; Editor-Elect, Robert E. Bell; Executive Committee members (to 1967), Wil- liam Mulloy and John M. Corbett. A motion was passed that the Society approve the nomination and election of Nathalie F. S. Woodbury as Treasurer of the Society to serve from 1965 to 1969 without having been elected a year previous to taking office as stipulated by Article II, Section 2 of the By-Laws. Old Business: Reports (printed below) were read on the conferences on Prehistoric Archaeology in the Aswan Dam Area and on Lithic Technology, which were spon- sored by the Society and the National Science Foundation in 1964. A report on progress of plans for the VII INQUA Congress was read, and members were urged to par- ticipate. New Business: R. D. Daugherty invited members to attend the International Conference on Radiocarbon and Tritium Dating taking place June 7-11, 1965, at Wash- ington State University. There was a brief discussion, initiated by C. H. Mc- Nutt, of publication problems in American archaeology. Numerous outlets for publication are available, but local journals are begging for manuscripts while American Antiquity is overloaded. The following resolutions were presented by the Com- mittee on Resolutions (Waldo R. Wedel, Chairman, and Douglas S. Byers) and were approved by the mrmbership: Be it resolved that the Society for American Archae- ology at its 30th Annual Meeting in Urbana, Illinois, express its gratitude to the University of Illinois at Urbana, to its President, David Dodds Henry, and to the Department of Anthropology and its Chairman, Joseph Casagrande, for their hospitality; Be is further resolved that the Society exp;ress its appreciation to the Program Committee, George I. Quim- by, Chairman, and to the Local Arrangements Committee, John C. MacGregor, Chairman, for the time and effort spent in arranging a highly successful meeting, and to the University of Illinois Women's Glee Club, Elmer Thomas, Director, for its entertainment at the annual dinner of the Society; Be it further resolved that the Society express its deep appreciation to Stephen T. Boggs, soon to retire as agent for the Society at the American Anthropological Association office in Washington for his wise council and superior management of the Society's affairs during his term of office; B2 is further resolved that the Society express its appreciation of the untiring and excellent services of its retiring Treasurer, Alfred Kidder II; And be it further resolved that the Society express its sense of great loss in the death since the last meeting of the following members: Glenn A. Black, Henry A. Carey, J. Louis Giddings, Jr., Samuel K. Lothrop, Ivar Skarland, and Arthur George Smith, and that the Secretary be instructed to send a copy of this resolution, together with expressions of sympathy, to the families of the deceased. ANNUAL BANQUET On Thursday evening, May 6, the annual banquet was held at the Urbana-Lincoln Hotel. After the dinner, the University of Illinois Women's Glee Club, directed by Elmer Thomas, entertained with a wide variety of very excellent music. Following this, L. S. B. Leakey of the National Museum, Nairobi, Kenya, presented an illustrated address entitled "Man's Earliest Tools and Weapons." BARBECUE On Friday evening, May 7, a barbecue was held at the Illini Grove. CONFERENCE ON PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE ASWAN DAM AREA, BELLAGIO, ITALY, AUGUST 24-28, 1964 The salvage program in prehistoric archaeology in the reservoir area of the new Aswan Dam in the United Arab Republic and the Republic of the Sudan has been in operation for approximately five years. In addition to the research of these countries, field work has been conducted by representatives of UNESCO and a number of Euro- pean, Asian, African, and American countries. The pur- poses of the conference were (1) to review the scientific results of the various expeditions; (2) to delineate the important problems of prehistory as perceived in the light of the results attained; (3) to compare the effectiveness of the various research methods which have been em- ployed; and (4) to discuss plans for future research with particular reference to major scientific objectives, im- provement of liaison among expeditions and between expeditions and local governments, and problems of logistics. The conference was sponsored by the Society for American Archaeology under a grant from the National Science Foundation and by the Rockefeller Foundation, which placed its Villa Serbelloni at the disposal of the conference. Twenty-six participants were present repre- senting the United Arab Republic, the Republic of the Sudan, UNESCO, the National Science Foundation, the Society for American Archaeology, the French Expedition, the Scandinavian Joint Expedition, and the expeditions of the University of Colorado, Yale University, Columbia 303</page><page sequence="2">304 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [ VOL. 31, No. 2, 1965 University-Museum of New Mexico, the University of Ghana, the Sudan Antiquities Service, and the National Museum of Canada. J. 0. Brew, Chairman of the UNESCO International Monuments Committee, served as chairman of the conference. Problems of supply and transportation and the prob- able schedule for the filling of the reservoir were dis- cussed by Thabit H. Thabit, Commissioner of Antiquities for the Republic of the Sudan, and Anwar Mohammed Shukry, Director of the Department of Antiquities for Egypt (United Arab Republic). Ali Vrioni, Director of the Service for the Monuments of Nubia, UNESCO, com- mented on the operation of the program from the stand- point of UNESCO. RWsum6s of the scientific results were presented by the directors and research representatives of the various expeditions and were followed by extensive discussions of the questions of interpretation and meth- odology raised by the work accomplished. Particular at- tention was given to the Pleistocene geological history of the area. The conference was closed by a session on planning of future research. The major remaining area of research is the upstream part of the reservoir basin in the Republic of the Sudan. The roster of participants was: WILLIAM Y.

SPAULDING CONFERENCE ON LITHIc TECHNOLOGY A conference on Lithic Technology, sponsored by the Society for American Archaeology and supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation, was held at Les Eyzies (Dordogne), France, during the week of No- vember 23-28, 1964. The purpose of the conference was to bring together a small number of American archaeologists who had been doing research Ion lithic technology, particularly as it related to Paleo-Indian horizons, or who were about to embark on such a project, together with experts in both percussion-flaking and pressure-flaking. A second objec- tive was to examine a number of late Old World Paleo- lithic collections with regard to their potential technical relationships to Paleo-Indian technologies. Professor Francois Bordes, Director of the Institute of Prehistory at the University of Bordeaux, France, and leading expert in percussion-flaking techniques, hosted the conference at the Institute's Les Eyzies laboratory. Donald Crabtree of Kimberly, Idaho, leading expert in pressure-flaking techniques, together with Professor Bordes, conducted a series of controlled experiments in the pro- duction of various kinds of flakes and implements. These experiments, suggested by the knappers and by the other participants, were designed to establish criteria for the recognition of various techniques employed by prehistoric peoples in the production of their stone tools. Charac- teristics resulting from various percussion and pressure techniques were noted. These will be detailed in future publications. Several collections of artifacts from America were analyzed by Bordes, Crabtree, and others for indications of the method of manufacture. One morning was spent in the examination of collections in the Les Eyzies Museum. This was a most successful conference, and it is felt that the results will greatly benefit American archaeology as they become generally available.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY The following regular committees were appointed by President Albert C. Spaulding and approved or elected by the Executive Committee, as required by the Constitution and By-Laws of the Society. Nominating Committee: Jesse D. Jennings, Chairman, Richard D. Daugherty, and Erik K. Reed. Program Committee: George I. Quimby, Jr., Chairman. Local Arrangements Committee: John C. McGregor, Chairman, Charles J. Bareis, Donald W. Lathrap, and Arthur H. Rohn, Jr. Elections Committee: E. Mott Davis, Chairman, David S. Dibble, and William T. Field, Jr. Resolutions Committee: Waldo R. Wedel, Chairman, and Douglas S. Byers. The Nominating Committee presented the following names for the 1965 election of officers: President-Elect: Clement W. Meighan, William H. Sears, and Joe Ben Wheat. Treasurer: Nathalie F. S. Woodbury. Editor-Elect: Robert E. Bell. First Executive Committee Member: William Mulloy, S. J. Olsen, and Dee Ann Suhm Story. Second Executive Committee Member: John M. Cor- bett, Allan H. Smith, and Earl H. Swanson. The Executive Committee held a special meeting at Chapel Hill, North Carolina, on May 8, 1964, and its regular meeting at Urbana, Illinois, on May 5, 1965. Other than those committee actions already noted, the actions of the Executive Committee included approval of the Milwaukee Public Museum for the 1966 Annual Meeting, the University of Michigan for the 1967 Annual Meeting, and the Museum of New Mexico for the 1968 Annual Meeting. The committee approved the reports of the Editor, Treasurer, and Secretary for 1964-65 and the proposed budget for 1965-66 as prepared by the Treasurer and modified by the Executive Committee. The President was instructed to appoint a special com- mittee to make specific recommendations toward enabling the continued publication of Abstracts of New Worldl Archaeology. The committee received reports of two conferences sponsored by the Society in 1964 -a Conference on Pre- historic Archaeology in the Oswan Dam Area and a Con- ference on Lithic Technology. Reports were also received from the Society representatives to the Council of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and to the VIII INQUA Congress. The Committee took under advisement a report by John H. Rowe, Chairman of a Committee appointed in 1962 to look into the possibility of establishment of a medal, named in honor of E. G. Squier, to be awarded by the Society in honor of outstanding achievement in American Archaeology. The Committee voted to accept the offer of Kraus Reprint Corporation to reprint Volumes 11 through 25 of American Antiquity. A motion was passed thanking and commending Al- fred Kidder II for his excellent service to the Society as Treasurer for the past four years. The Committee approved the nomination and election in a manner different from that stipulated in the By-Laws, of Nathalie F. S. Woodbury as Treasurer to serve from 1965-69, and referred the matter to the Annual Business Meeting for final approval. Alfred Kidder II was appointed a delegate to the International Congress of Anthropological and Ethno- logical Sciences in Moscow and to the International Con- gress of Americanists in Madrid in 1964. The office of the Secretary has handled the following work load during the past year, in addition to coordi- nating Society affairs such as nominations and elections: new membership applications received, approved, and sent on to the Washington office, 242; complaints, changes of address, and similar matters received, acknowledged, and mostly sent on to Washington, 82; inquiries about membership from persons who did not join or have not yet joined, 86; requests for publications and miscellaneous matters, 47; requests for information on archaeology</page><page sequence="5">SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY 307 (principally from junior and senior high school students and a few from high school counselors), 270; total items processed, 727. Following the recommendations of the past secretary and the Executive Committee, a list is now being main- tained of the names and addresses of all students writing for information on archaeology as a career, with a note as to the nature of the query. This list is to be checked in future years to see how many of these young people make their way into the profession. To all of these inquiries, the office sends a reprint of Rowe's article from Archae- ology entitled "Archaeology as a Career." Respectfully submitted, E. MOTT DAVIS, Secretary REPORT OF THE TREASURER With a continuing increase in membership (206 during the fiscal year), coupled with the effect of the first full year of increased dues, the Society appears to be in very good financial condition. This has made possible a budget, approved by the Executive Committee, that will take care of all normal activities covered by the Operating Fund and should leave us with a cash surplus of perhaps as much as approximately $3000. Had it not been for neces- sary, but unanticipated, expenses involving a change to envelopes from wrappers for the mailing of American Antiquity and the printing of a new supply of office materials, we would have ended the fiscal year with a small cash surplus. As it is, increased income will much more than offset the cash deficit of $1110 that is shown in the Auditor's report on the Operating Fund as of March 31, 1965. The Publication Fund is also in good condition, with a cash balance of $19,647. This is not as optimistic as it might seem, since it is largely the result of the publication of only one Memoir during the past two fiscal years. We are budgeting for at least two Memoirs this year, and there are ample funds for a third, should it be ready for the press before next spring. The third section of the budget pertains to Abstracts of New World Archaeology. Volume 3 is in galley proof and there are funds in hand for its publication. For Vol- ume 4, which is in copy, there will remain no further subsidy from outside sources. The Executive Committee is therefore faced with the problem of obtaining a new subsidy or continuing this valuable series under the Pub- lication Fund. During the past year the Executive Secretary's office of the American Anthropological Association found it necessary to raise its charges for handling the distribution of back numbers of American Antiquity. This has been included in the new budget but will decrease in future as more and more volumes are depleted and as the Kraus Reprint Corporation takes over back numbers. Finally, as the first Treasurer of our Society to serve his entire term under the agreement through which the office of the Executive Secretary of the American An- thropological Association handles all the routine of bill- ing, banking, and accounting, I should like again to record my thanks to Stephen T. Boggs and Margery Foote for their unfailing cooperation, sound advice, and fruitful investment of funds not required for immediate purposes. Respectfully submitted, ALFRED KIDDER II, Treasurer FALLS CHURCH, VA., April 23, 1965 Gentlemen: I have examined the Statements of Receipts, Disburse- ments, and Assets of the Operating Fund, the Publication Fund, the Permanent Fund, and the New World Archae- ology Account for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1965. My examination was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and such other audit- ing procedtures as I considered necessary in the circtum- stances. In my opinion the accompanying statements present fairly a summary of the recorded receipts and disburse- ments and the assets arising from such cash transactions as at March 31, 1965.

Volume 20 contained 25 major articles, two obituaries, 42 Facts and Comments articles, 86 book reviews, four sections of Current Research, the report of the 1964 annual meeting at Chapel Hill, various announcements, the Society membership list, and the index to Volume 30. In this volume of American An- tiquity, about 70% of the space was taken up by articles, 14% by book reviews, and 10% by Current Research. The number of book reviews published was more than twice that of the preceding year. Three new titles in the Microcard series, Archives of Archaeology, were published jointly by the Soiciety and the University of Wisconsin Press. There are now 26 titles in the Microcard series. In 1964-65, the Society also published Memoir 18-Robert E. Greengo's Issaquena: An Archaeological Phase in the Yazoo Basin of the Lower Mississippi Valley -which runs to 130 pages. Also in press is Memoir 19, Contributions of the Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project, assembled by Douglas Osborne and edited by Bernard S. Katz. This large memoir will be distributed with the October issue of American Antiquity. This year there have been few American Antiquity editorial staff changes, and all of these involve assistant editorships for Current Research. Gareth Lowe has re- placed William R. Coe for Eastern Mesoamerica, and Thomas C. Patterson has replaced Edward P. Lanning for Highland South America. The current editor will retire in May, 1966, at which time Robert E. Bell, Editor-Elect, will assume office. The coming year will be transitional. At present enough manuscripts have been accepted to fill all the remaining issues of American Antiquity that will be published by the outgoing editor. This means that all manuscripts from now on should be submitted to the Editor-Elect for evaluation. If manuscripts are submitted to the outgoing editor, he will automatically forward them to the new editor. In our opinion, the Society for American Archaeology has chosen a very capable man for its new editor. He has had considerable editorial experience and is well-known to you as a man of integrity and good judgment. May we suggest that you make his job easier by sending him well- written manuscripts that conform in all details to the journal style. He faces not only the time-consuming routine of editing but also the problem of steadily rising publication costs. Undoubtedly he will appreciate manu- scripts that are succinct and not oberburdened with detail that might better be published in Microcard form. Respectfully submitted, T. N. CAMPBELL, Editor DESIGNATION OF RADIOCARBON DATES Previous to the development of radiocarbon dating, the age of levels or artifacts was expressed in years before or after the beginning of the Christian era. Even those who used dates in the systems of "guestimates," which had some benighted vogue a few years ago, employed the A.D./B.C. system. Because of the nature of radiocarbon dates, and particularly because the figures were referred to the half-life of C 14, Libby began recording dates in years before the present. As a result, we have had to deal with a second system of counting, that is, dates B.P. As time went on both sets of dates were used indiscrimi- nately, so that sometimes dates B.P. and A.D./B.C. could be found in a single book or even chapter. The adding and subtracting in order to reduce these to a single scale was distracting to say the least. For a time there was not much that could be done about this because no standard was established by the laboratories which were developing the method. Also, there were difficulties so far as the laboratory men were concerned in expressing the dates by means of the Grego- rian calendar. The situation was discussed at various international radiocarbon conferences. At the Cambridge Conference in 1962 it was decided that all dates would b- referred to A.D. 1950. Since this decision it is clear that dates which are quoted as B.P. are really no longer "before the present" but actually before 1950. Given this stand- ard reference year, that is, 1950, it is possible to end the confusion by doing away with B.P. Dates B.C. can be estab- lished simply by subtracting 1950 from the mean of the years B.P., which is usually quoted in laboratory lists, and dates A.D. are found by subtracting the mean from 1950. We hasten to add that this by no means relieves the author of the significant responsibility of providing the laboratory number of the sample dates and the range of error. This latter is very important because it is the range of error which indicates the area where the date may lie, given two chances out of three if it is one sigma. Those who have followed the progress of the use of radiocarbon dates, particularly by archaeologists, can point to some horrendous and ludicrous mistakes in interpretation of chronological data because the nature of the statistics in- volved in calculating the dates has been ignored (Fred- erick Johnson). (Hereafter American Antiquity will follow the practice recommended by Johnson -Editor.) NOMINATING COMMITTEE FOR 1965-66 The chairman of the 1965-66 Nominating Committee is Douglas S. Schwartz, Department of Anthropology, University of Kentucky, Lexington. Offices for which nominations will be made are: President-Elect (one-year term, will serve as President in 1966-67) and two mem- bers of the Executive Committee (two-year terms). Members of the Society are reminded that they may suggest names of candidates for these offices before De- cember 1, 1965.
