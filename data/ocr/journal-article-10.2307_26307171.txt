DATING RESULTS FROM EXCAVATIONS IN QUARRY TUNNELS BEHIND THE PYRAMID OF THE SUN AT TEOTIHUACAN Linda Manzanilla,3 Claudia López,3 and AnnCorinne Freterb instituto de Investigaciones Antropológicas, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de Mexico, Ciudad universitaria, 04510 México, D.F. bDepartment of Sociology and Anthropology, Ohio University, Athens, OH 4S70I, USA Abstract In this article we summarize the results of an ongoing project designed to study the tunnels and caves of Teotihuacan, emphasizing those findings derived from the excavation of four extraction tunnels located immediately to the east of the Pyramid of the Sun. In particular, we present radiocarbon and obsidian-hydration dates from the Cueva de las Varillas, where 13 Mazapan-phase burials were found and which has substantial evidence for a post-Teotihuacan occupation. In addition, the Cueva del Pirul has produced evidence of another 14 human burials, which were predominantly children, as well as complete dog skeletons, in a context clearly related to underworld symbolism. After the fall of Teotihuacan, these underground cavities excavated into tezontle continued to provide space for the practitioners of Tlaloc and fertility cult activities. In Aztec times, they were living spaces, and given the lack of space on the surface, this was a function that they served well into the twentieth century. This paper reviews some of the results of an ongoing project, be gun in 1987, in the Teotihuacan Valley (Arzate et al. 1990; Barba et al. 1990; Chávez et al. 1994; Manzanilla 1994a, 1994b; Man zanilla et al. 1989,1994). The study deals with a system of tunnels under the northern part of the ancient city, a system originally cre ated for the extraction of porous volcanic materials used to build the ancient city of Teotihuacan (Figure 1). Barba Pingarrón (1995) has demonstrated that 670,000 cubic meters of volcanic scoria were removed from the large depressions in the northern half of the val ley. After the extractive activities, the tunnels were used as dwell ing, ritual, and burial sites for post-Teotihuacan occupations. THE TEOTIHUACAN SYSTEM OF TUNNELS The existence of underground passages in Teotihuacan is well known. Heyden (1981) reproduces the glyph of Teotihuacan from the Codex Xólotl (Dibble 1951), which depicts two large pyra mids overlying a cave with a person inside (Figure 2). It is likely that this figure represents the oracles mentioned in the Relación de Teotihuacan (Soruco Saenz 1985:107) that were frequently lo cated in caves. In addition, toponyms such as Oztoyahualco and Oztoticpac make reference to caves. Archaeological research conducted in these tunnels includes Linné's (1934) excavations at San Francisco Mazapa; De Terra and Bastien's (Armillas 1950) exploration of the Calaveras Pit. where 35 human skulls were found; Carmen Cook de Leonard's (1952: 49; Millón 1957) work at Oztoyahualco; and Michael and Eliza beth Goodliffe's (1963) excavations in four interconnected tun neis in Purificación, containing Teotihuacan, Mazapan, and Aztec II and III ceramics. Other projects of note are Obermeyer's (1963) excavation of the Huexóctoc Cave in Oxtoticpac; Heyden's (1973, 1975; Baker et al. 1974) study of the tunnel below the Pyramid of the Sun, excavated by Acosta and used during Teotihuacan II times (first to third centuries a.d.) for ritual purposes; Basante Gutiérrez's (1982, 1986) explorations in several tunnels and holes in the valley; and finally Soruco Saenz's (1985, 1991) exploration of a cavity probably for solar observations, located to the south east of the Pyramid of the Sun, where a basalt stela on an altar displayed a ray of light in its center at the beginning of the sum mer solstice. In August 1992, we began the extensive excavation of four tun nels to the east of the Pyramid of the Sun (Manzanilla 1994a, 1994b; Manzanilla et al. 1994). In 1994, two other cavities were tested by the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia's (INAH) Proyecto Especial 92-94. One was found to be a smaller replica of Soruco Saenz's solar observatory (Moragas Segura 1994). The general ob jective of our project consisted of locating and defining tunnels and cavities of archaeological interest based on their potential rit ual or economic use. These include: the original extractive activ ities related to porous pyroclastic volcanic materials, large-scale storage, burials, offerings related to fertility rites, and domestic and manufacturing activities. Storage and funerary loci found in two of the four tunnels excavated behind the Pyramid of the Sun (Cueva de las Varillas and Cueva del Piral) informed on all of these topics, and numerous activity areas related to post-Teotihuacan oc cupational levels (hearths, hide- and textile-working areas, bi facial obsidian-production loci, etc.) also were located. 245</page><page sequence="2">246 Manzanilla, López, and Freter Since 1987, we surveyed the northern part of the Teotihuacan Valley from a geological perspective, in order to assess the dis tinct types of volcanic phenomena present in the region. The lo cation of visible holes and depressions were registered along with their coordinates, azimuths, and lithological contexts (Arzate et al. 1990; Barba Pingarrón 1995; Barba et al. 1990; Chávez et al. 1994; Manzanilla 1994a, 1994b; Manzanilla et al. 1989, 1994). Magnetometry, electrical resistivity, gravimetry, and ground penetrating radar were used in the intermediate sectors between depressions to detect anomalies associated with the presence of cavities and to trace the tunnels. In order to confirm the magnetic results and locate the tunnels precisely, several electrical profiles were measured on top of the magnetic profiles. In addition, ex ploratory drillings were made to obtain cores of the subsoil asso ciated with certain anomalies (Arzate et al. 1990; Barba et al. 1990; Chávez et al. 1988, 1994; Manzanilla et al. 1994). Finally, extensive archaeological excavations were carried out to reconstruct activities that took place in the tunnels. Radio carbon and obsidian-hydration dates have been obtained from primary contexts. Chemical, phytolith, pollen, botanical, and faunal Figure 2. Glyph of Teotihuacan from the Codex Xólotl. Figure 1. View of Teotihuacan from the Pyramid of the Moon to the south. macrofossil analyses have been undertaken alongside archaeolog ical analyses. Quarry tunnels are common in the northern part of the Teoti huacan Valley. At the time of the initial settlement of the valley, the area was probably characterized by a substrate of volcanic emis sion zones submerged in volcanic tuff. That is the reason why large volcanic bombs are observed inside tunnels. The emissions zones are characterized by linear basaltic flows surrounded by pyro clasts (porous volcanic scoria). To build the city, the Teotihua canos extracted the pyroclasts by tunneling under the overlying tuff. Where many chambers coalesced, large depressions were formed when the ceilings collapsed. In some cases the scoria was excavated in areas already weak ened as a result of contact between tuff and pyroclasts with the slopes of the emission zones, as is the case with the tunnel asso ciated with the Pyramid of the Sun. Perhaps the Teotihuacanos were looking for a preferred size and color of pyroclasts; because of its lightness, this material was easily extracted, transported, and made suitable for construction use. In summary, the system of tunnels, or man-made holes, in the Teotihuacan Valley was the result of quarrying porous volcanic materials under the volcanic tuff (tepetate) for building enter prises, during the Patlachique or Tzacualli periods (150 b.c.-a.d. 150). We wish to correct, therefore, the idea, derived from Heyden (1975) and Millón (1973), that they are natural. No natural pro cesses in volcanic contexts produce large or long passages, except lava tubes, and these are certainly not lava tubes. These cavities have been excavated by extracting pyroclasts that were once ejected into the air, and then fell still hot enough to fuse with the former materials. The original settlement of the valley consisted of three-temple plazas surrounded by dwelling sites, and not the very dense ur ban site originally proposed by Millón (1973). The quarry mouths were found very near these pyramid complexes, due to the quan tity of construction material needed for the raising of the pyra mids themselves. The plazas of these complexes seemed to be deliberately located on top of the tunnels. We do not yet know whether there is a physical connection between the tunnels and the plazas.</page><page sequence="3">Teotihuacan quarry tunnels 247 Figure 3. Three of the tunnels excavated, inside the protected archaeological zone [Cueva de la Basura, Cueva de las Varillas, and Cueva del Pirul]. OCCUPATIONAL HISTORY AND CHRONOLOGY Four tunnels, located 200-270 m to the east of the Pyramid of the Sun, were excavated. Three (Cueva de la Basura, Cueva de las Varillas, and Cueva del Pirul) lie inside the protected archaeolog ical zone (Figure 3). The fourth (Cueva del Camino) is located under the road near the La Gruta Restaurant. In general, the four have the same general stratigraphic sequence: a series of modern and Postclassic occupational levels within a loose, grayish-brown matrix, approximately 1 m deep. This mate rial overlies a fill of yellowish-brown disintegrated tuff. On its sur face we found either Coyotlatelco activity areas or Mazapan funerary remains. Within it we found painted Teotihuacan pottery sherds, painted slate, and human bones, including cut skulls. This fill was cultural because it was also present in tunnels with no tuff (tepetate) overlying the volcanic scoria (tezontle) where the tun nels were excavated. Originally it may have had Teotihuacan buri als or ritual activity areas, probably looted during Coyotlatelco times. A third stratum (clearly represented in the Cueva de la Basura) was represented by a reddish-brown volcanic scoria fill with small basalt fragments, bone, mica, obsidian, ceramics, and carbonized materials. Below a modern occupational level, Cueva del Camino— deprived of natural light—yielded a vast amount of Aztec III ma terial, with food-preparation and cooking-activity areas, particularly hearths with comales, dated between a.d. 1280 and 1450 (Beta 65547, 560 ± 80 b.p.) (see Appendix) (Figure 4). In addition, there were complete plates and jars, projectile points, grinding instru 1800 1600 U00 1200 1000 eoo 600 (00 200 AD 0 BC &lt; m t- io UJ , CD &lt; ® n ui i m «* ; in o&gt; ct&gt; CUEVA DEL CAMINO CUEVA DE LA BASURA Figure 4.

Spe cifically Teotihuacan materials, such as stucco polishers, portrait figurines, and candeleros, were present as if the Aztec were se lecting and treasuring these objects. Under this Aztec occupation, many green-obsidian fragments were recovered. Obsidian-hydration dates averaged a.d. 699-865, perhaps related to a disturbed Epiclassic occupation (represented clearly by Coyotlatelco and some Mazapan ceramics). The Cueva de la Basura is located 88 m to the east of the Platform of the Sun. Below a modern occupation level, and in many sectors of the tunnel—some near the entrance, and others in the dark parts—some Mazapan ceramics were located, present ing clear evidence of Coyotlatelco activity areas (around a.d. 700) and ritual activity areas with omechicahuaztle objects (engraved objects made from animal long bones or deer antler, frequently found also in the next tunnel mentioned). In the disintegrated tuff stratum we recovered mica, carbonized materials, potter (partic ularly broken Teotihuacan polychrome pottery), lithics, cut and rounded human skulls, onyx pendants, needles, pounders, Pru nus capuli seeds, etc. (with radiocarbon dates between a.d. 350 and 550). There is also one date (Beta-69912, average calibrated date ca. a.d. 80) that could be related to the original extractive activities in the tunnels. Besides the early 14C date from this cave (Beta-69912), there are others from the lower tunnel of the Pyramid of the Sun (M-1283; Millón et al. 1965:33) and the Temple of the Feathered Serpent (Rattray 1991:12) that date to ca. a.d. 80. This could be evidence of major construction enterprises involving the tunnels and the main pyramids. The Cueva de las Varillas was 50 m in length; it had a vast en trance chamber, 18 m in diameter, with seven small niches, and a tunnel that crosses three small chambers. Its southern side is con nected to another chamber that had well-preserved funerary and storage contexts, which will be discussed below. Except for the funerary chamber (Chamber 2), the rest of the cavity contained modern, Colonial, Aztec, Mazapan, and Coyo tlatelco domestic contexts, as well as disturbed ritual materials from the Teotihucan era. Many different activities are represented by the Epiclassic and Postclassic living floors (dated from a.d. 650 to 1500) (Figures 5-7): spinning, sewing and weaving, painting and sealing, wood and bone working, food preparation and consump tion, domestic ritual, and perhaps hide preparation. Living floors were detected by the presence of compacted clay surfaces, hearths, traditional food resources (Manzanilla and McClung de Tapia 1996), many types of artifacts, and refuse areas. Figurines from Preclassic to Colonial times were found, as well as a basalt human 1800 1600 K00 1200 1000 800 600 AOO 200 AD 0 BC CUEVA DE LAS VARILLAS Figure 5.

Many of the vessels seem to be ritually killed; we have been able to reconstruct them by piecing together sherds coming from dif ferent squares of the grid, and in some cases, from different cham bers, as if they were intentionally smashed and scattered. There are also some hints of a cult that involved marine ele ments, such as different types of mother-of-pearl shells, a caudal spine from a sting ray, and fragments of marine turtle shells. We can also cite some examples of foreign pottery from the Gulf Coast and the Maya area (particularly polychrome sherds). Underneath these occupation levels, there are 3 m of disinte grated tuff, a material that naturally overlies, in a compact way, the pyroclastic fill in which the cavities were excavated. This loose fill had some fragments of painted slate and cut human skulls with polished rims to allow drinking. These resemble the ones De Terra and Bastien found in the Calaveras pit associated with Miccaotli ceramics (Armillas 1950). In the funerary chamber of this cave (Figure 8), beneath the modern occupation and the Aztec floors, there were funerary and storage contexts (these last probably to store Amaranthus for the deads' masks, but also for "incubating" maize or Chenopodium) of late Coyotlatelco and early Mazapan date, with complete ves sels. Thirteen burials in all were found. A group of three seated adults facing south (one with a bilobulated skull) were placed around a pillar in the chamber (Figures 9 and 10), and two infants were placed near the adults at the level of their heads. This first group appears to be placed on the northeastern fringe of the cham ber. All of the burials had complete (Figures 11 and 12) and ritu ally killed pottery vessels, as well as some projectile points as offerings. The complete vessels associated with the adults are mostly Macana Red-on-brown tripod molcajetes that may date to the tran sition of the Terminal Corral/Tollan phases (Cobean 1990). These vessels are associated with two radiocarbon dates (Beta-75377, with an average around a.d. 930, and Beta-75381, with an average date of a.d. 730), and two obsidian-hydration dates, one of which (94-51) averaged around a.d. 930 (the other is related to an Aztec intrusion near Burial 2). Some of the infants near the three adults had associated Mazapan Red-on-brown painted bowls, which Co bean (1990:46) dates to the Terminal Corral phase. Two obsidian hydration dates (94-49 and 94-50) from this context average around a.d. 950. The association of this type of bowl with human burials Figure 8. View of the excavation process of the fu nerary chamber of the Cueva de las Varillas. at Teotihuacan has been documented by Linné (1934:75) and Armillas (1950:56). In the central sector of the chamber and at a somewhat higher topographical level, seven newborn infants were found, some in a seated position, and others in the fetal position. They were placed in and east-west band in the central part of the chamber beneath a large hole cut in the ceiling. In the eastern half of the chamber the Late Coyotlatelco contexts are higher than in the western half, as if a large excavation in the disgreggated tuff was made for place ment of the adult and child burials. Offerings consisted of trian gles or rectangles of cut mica as well as some hearths with Figure 9.

They were dated to the seventh century a.d. In this chamber we also found seven circular storage-bin bases (Figure 13) distributed in different sectors and depths of the level corresponding to the adult burials. In an inner chamber (Cham ber 3), 50 m inside the cave, we had already found six of these storage contexts (Figure 14), one with a vast amount of stored Che nopodium (verdolaga), but with no apparent association to burials (Manzanilla 1994a). The Cueva del Pirul was the last excavated (Figures 15 and 16). We encountered Aztec structures and activity areas with cali brated radiocarbon dates between a.d. 1410 and 1435. In different chambers near the entrance for the tunnel, we have found another 14 burials under the Aztec material that date between the sixth and ninth centuries a.d. These included two seated adults (one with bilobulated skull, and the other dated to the sixth century a.d.), Two young adults in fetal positions, and sets of child (four) (Fig ure 17) and perinatal burials (six). A group of six burials, mainly infants, was placed around a killed hemispherical monochrome bowl Figure II. Mazapan Red-on-brown bowl associated with Burial 4 in the Cueva de las Varillas. Figure 10. View of Burials 5 and 6, also seated adults. with seal-like designs of a type named "Jiménez Sealed Brown" (Cobean 1990:194-198; Good and Obermeyer 1986:258, Plate 7; Nichols and McCullough 1986:Plates 8 and 9). This type has been assigned by Cobean to the Coyotlatelco sphere and to the Corral complex. He suggests that these bowls were used to drink choco late. Our excavations have uncovered numerous examples of this type, with different kinds of seal motifs. Another type frequently found in contact with the disintegrated tuff is a negative painted bowl (Good and Obermeyer 1986:Plate 11). Three complete, articulated dog skeletons (Figure 18), two adults and a puppy, one with skeletal deformities, were found near two of the children and one of the newborn infants. They may have been conceived of as guides to the underworld. In another sector, a newborn infant was placed inside a bowl (Figure 19) near one of the seated adults (with a calibrated radiocarbon average date of a.d. 550) and an eight-month-old baby in fetal position covered with another bowl. These two tunnels (Cueva de las Varillas and Cueva del Pirul) gave us elements to confirm three of the functions predicted by the project: storage areas associated with Tlaloc and fertility ritu als in the womb of the earth, burials as part of the underworld Figure 12. Red-on-orange and Red-on-brown tripod Macana molcajetes as sociated with Burials 2 and 6 in the Cueva de las Varillas.</page><page sequence="8">252 Manzanilla, López, and Freter Figure 13.

Virtually all the underground cavities in the Teotihuacan Valley were origi nally extraction places excavated around a.d. 80 to obtain pyro clastic construction materials under the volcanic tuff. In later periods, these underground passages were used either ritually or domestically. Thus, the tunnel underneath the Pyramid of the Sun could be conceived of as one of the many tunnels that ran under the ancient city (and under the volcanic tuff), in the northern part of the Valley, and not as a natural cave. From the Guatemalan highlands, Brady and Veni (1992) have documented Mayan examples of "man-made caves" excavated into volcanic or volcanically derived rocks. Some of these are associ ated with sites of ritual importance and with intermittent springs. In Teotihuacan, the tunnels are also excavated in rather loose con solidated volcanic materials, using perhaps pointed basalt or andes ite picks, or even just loosening them by hand. Instead of housing springs, as Heyden (1975) originally proposed for the Pyramid of the Sun (that would be a very improbable phenomenon in this type of porous material), there are perhaps small water courses that de rive from vertical seepage in the northeastern sector of the valley. These courses have been mentioned in various interviews with lo cal people. The real springs emerge in the alluvial plain in the south western part of the ancient city. In Xochicalco, a system of more than 19 man-made tunnels, of which the Observatory is just a part, is also a quarry from which one of the two types of limestone for building was ex tracted. Recent geophysical work undertaken inside and on top of the Cueva de los Jabalíes and Cueva de los Amates (better known as the "Observatory"), has produced evidence of interconnections between these systems, as well as a grid-like plan (Manzanilla 1993). The eastern sectors of both systems run beneath the west ern part of the Acropolis, suggesting that they continued to the main plaza. The tunnels were excavated in different levels of the mountain, suggesting either stratification of the systems, or stair like ascensions. RITUAL USE OF THE TUNNELS Caves had multiple functions and meanings for pre-Hispanic peoples. Some of these include shelters, living sites, ritual places associated with lineages and rites of passage, solar observato ries, quarries, dwellings of the gods of water and those of death, mouth or womb of the earth, underworld, fantastic space, etc. Creation myths relate caves to the sun, the moon, food, and hu man group emergences (Taube 1986). Caves are entrances to the underworld (and, therefore, funerary chambers), but also accesses to the womb of the earth (and thus, a place where fertility rites also take place). Water petition ceremonies for good harvests take place in caves, where water spirits dwell (Weitlaner and Leonard 1959). Figure 14.

There is evidence of cult activities in caves from the Forma tive period, related to ancestor and underworld worship (Townsend 1993:41), but also to frog/water deities (Spranz 1973:63). In Post classic times, we also have examples of caves related either to the assumption of power or to foundation rites, as well as to the Tlaloc cult, together with numerous cases of underground dwell ing sites. The Nahua associated three locations with the underworld: Mic tlan, Tlillan, and Tlalocan. Mictlan was located to the north, and was guarded by the gods of death (Mendoza 1962). The Nahua believed that the sun entered Mictlan during the first month of its zenith passage, that is Tóxcatl (in May), in the prelude to the rainy season (Broda 1982:94); thus, solar observatories, such as the "As tronomical Caves" at Teotihuacan, were used to observe these ze nith passages. According to Anderson (1988:153-154), Tlalocan was concep tualized in many ways among the Nahua of central Mexico: a place of great wealth, where there was no suffering, where maize, as well as squash, amaranth, chile, and flowers were abundant; a place of beauty, where birds with lovely feathers sang on top of pyramids of jade; a four-room construction with four water containers, as well as an underground space filled with water, which connected the mountains with the sea. It also was a place where rivers originated. Sullivan's (1965:55) translation of the Florentine Codex "Prayer to Tlaloc" states the following, referring to the gods of rain; "And you who inhabit the four quarters of the universe, you the Lords of Verdure, you the Providers, you the Lords of the Mountain heights, you the Lords of the Cavernous Depths." It is possible that the underground cavities created by the ex traction process were conceived of as the underworld of Tlaloc, the Tlalocan, in its invocation of Tonacatecuhtli, god of suste nance and fertility. The burials, particularly those of infants, re lated to rain water pouring from the ceiling of the tunnel, the storage loci, and the marine elements found in the Cueva de las Varillas reinforce this interpretation. The underworld issue is stated by the adult seated burials as well as by the complete dog skeletons. Figure 18. Two dog skeletons a meter to the west of the child burials in Figure 17.</page><page sequence="11">Teotihuacan quarry tunnels 255 Figure 19. A newborn infant (Burial 16] inside of a bowl, found in Cham ber 1 of the Cueva del Pirul. In a recent study of a Nahuat-speaking group in the Sierra de Puebla region of Mexico, Knab (1991) described a myth that men tions the geography of the underworld or Talocan, as conceived by the inhabitants of San Miguel Tzinacapan. Caves are consid ered to be entrances to the underworld. In particular, the eastern and western entrances of the myth are toponyms related to the Teotihuacan Valley, and the northern and southern entrances are geomorphological features of the same valley. It is probable that the myth of the Nahuat-speakers in the Sierra de Puebla is de rived from a version based on the sacred geography of the Teo tihuacan Valley, but it is also quite possible that both have their source in an archetypical Mesoamerican conception of the under world. In thinking about ritual use of the underground cavities, dif ferent rites could have been practiced inside the tunnels. Brady and Stone (1986:19) proposed that Naj Tunich cave in Guate mala could have been a burial place for members of Maya roy alty. There is a high probability that this is also true for many caves and tunnels ritually used during the Classic period in cen tral Mexico. We have entertained the hypothesis that the principal bureau crats of the ancient city of Teotihuacan were buried in this under world, a Tlalocan, or underworld of the state god. Many of the polished stone funerary masks, found mainly in private collec tions, but also from pre-Hispanic looting, could have come from these burials. In fact, we have evidence that people using Coyo tlatelco, Mazapan, and Aztec ceramics dwelt in these caves, and looted them. Yet we believe that there could be some primary con texts left undisturbed by these and modern looters. In the funerary chamber of the Cueva de las Varillas, Epiclassic Early Postclassic peoples constructed a shrine for the tlaloques or Tlaloc assistants, represented by the seven babies deposited in the central part of the chamber, precisely underneath a hole in the cavi ty's roof, a hole that may have allowed the pouring of water on top of the shrine during the rainy season. The adult burials were seated facing south, with their backs to a pillar (a sustaining element left by the Teotihuacanos in their extraction activities, to prevent the cavity from collapsing). Other types of rites practiced inside the tunnels could have been related to fertility ceremonies in the womb of the earth. In fact, Armillas (Navarrete, personal communication 1992) men tioned the fact that hundreds of storage-vessel fragments were thrown out when the La Gruta Restaurant was enlarged. Large scale ritualized storage would be one of the main aspects we are interested in. In the Cueva de las Varillas, we recovered 13 storage-bin bases, of which 7 surround the burial area, and 6 are in an inner chamber, located 50 m from the entrance, which is too far inside to be prac tical for economic use. Some only contain Chenopodium (huauh zontle); others, only Amaranthus (sixteenth-century historical sources mention the placing of amaranth pastes over the faces of Tlaloc sacrificial victims), and still others contain the remains of maize and other plants (Manzanilla and McClung de Tapia 1996). We believe that some of these form part of fertility propitiation rites, serving as loci for "incubating" seeds for future agricultural cycles. It is interesting to that the Pyramid of the Sun is the only struc ture not constructed from the porous volcanic material known as tezontle, which comes from the tunnels. Instead it was built mainly with earth and small fragments of tuff (Rattray 1975), a material that generally overlies the volcanic scoria. It seems that this mon umental construction is the only one built with organic soil com ing either from Formative agricultural fields in the northern half of the valley (nearly all the main constructions in the city are founded on the volcanic tuff) or from the alluvial plain, perhaps from the Acolman area. In 1989, we interviewed elderly members of the local commu nities regarding the "caves" at Teotihuacan. Different persons men tioned a myth that states that in the past, in February, a man was seen coming from under the Pyramid of the Sun, carrying maize, amaranth, green beans, and squash in his hands. Many added that under the Pyramid of the Sun there were also chinampa-\ike fields where all this foodstuff was collected. The concept of a mountain of sustenance—the Tonacatepetl of the Nahua tradition—is frequent in Mesoamerica. Also common is the sacred mountain with a cave from which water emerged (Freidel et al. 1993:430). We propose then that the Pyramid of the Sun was conceived of as a Tonacatepetl or "mountain of sus tenance"; this is reinforced by the mention made in the Relación de Teotihuacan (Paso y Troncoso 1979:222) in which the idol in the summit of the pyramid was Tonacateuctli. Other "mountains of sustenance" were built in rain-producing mountains such as Tetzcotzingo and Mount Tlaloc, according to Townsend (1993:38). Finally, the Templo Mayor of Tenochtitlan would have been a continuation of this tradition (Broda 1987). The Pyramid of the Sun could have synthesized three inti mately related concepts: the Tonacatépetl, the main temple for the state-god Tlaloc, and the sacred mountain (the center of the uni verse, represented as the center of the four-petal flower, as López Austin [1989] has suggested). Teotihuacan was built as a sacred copy of the cosmos. Its ter restrial plane is divided into the four corners of the universe; it has a celestial plane with the sky itself and the summits of the temples, but also an underworld represented by the system of tunnels under the northern half of the city. Its main avenue con nected the natural sacred mountain of Cerro Gordo—where To briner (1972) detected a cave of special significance—with-the Pyramid of the Sun (the artificial "mountain of sustenance"), and the spring area to the south (Townsend 1993:41). The east-west avenue traces the path of the Pleiades in the summer solstice (Townsend 1993).</page><page sequence="12">256 Manzanilla, López, and Freter RESUMEN Este artículo expone resultados recientes del proyecto "Estudio de túneles y cuevas en Teotihuacan," particularmente aquellos derivados de la exca vación de cuatro túneles de extracción ubicados inmediatamente al este de la Pirámide del Sol. En particular, se pone énfasis en los fechamientos de radiocarbono y de hidratación de obsidiana de la Cueva de las Varillas, en la que se hallaron 13 entierros de tiempos Mazapan, y en la cual se tiene evidencia de ocupación intensiva post-teotihuacana. Asimismo, el cuarto túnel—la Cueva del Pirul—ha proporcionado evidencia de otros 14 enti erros, predominando niños, además de esqueletos completos de perros, en un contexto claramente alusivo al concepto del inframundo. Después de la caída de Teotihuacan, las cavidades subterráneas—alguna vez canteras de tezontle—fueron lugares de culto a Tláloc y a la fertilidad. En tiempos mexicas, fueron lugares de vivienda, dada la escasez de espacio en la su perficie, función que conservaron hasta la primera mitad de este siglo.

APPENDIX: CALIBRATED RADIOCARBON AND OBSIDIAN-HYDRATION DATES OBS1DIAN-HYDRATION ANALYSIS Like amino-acid racemization and fluorine diffusion, obsidian hy dration is a chemical process, therefore, physical environmental factors affect the rate of rim formation. These environmental fac tors have been divided into primary variables (those that directly affect the time function—the obsidian source, the effective hydra tion temperature [EHT], soil RH and pH) and secondary variables</page><page sequence="14">258 Manzanilla, López, and Freter (those that affect the rim formation but are independent of the time function—artifact burning, surface weathering, artifact reuse and spalling off of thick hydration rims due to mechanical strain). The hydration-dating analysis for the tunnels at Teotihuacan was con ducted in 1994, at which time the primary and secondary variables affecting the hydration process of the site were defined or esti mated insofar as possible. Primary Variables EHT estimate. Based on air-temperature data recorded over a seven-month period, the average temperature in the tunnels was estimated at 288.54°K or °C (6°F), which translates into an EHT of 289.35°K. This EHT of 289.35 °K, when placed into Michels's (1986) in duction equation for Pachuca obsidian, produced a hydration-rate estimate of 6.95 microns/1,000 years (see Freter [1993] for a com plete summary of this method). Obsidian source, soil RH and pH Estimates. The obsidian source (chemical composition) in this hydration analysis was held con stant; all artifacts analyzed were from the Pachuca green obsidian source (Cerro de Las Navajas, Hidalgo). Soil RH in this study was estimated to be 100%—the same as the conditions under which the induction experiment (Michels 1986) was performed. Given the current data available (see Freter 1993:288-289), this estimate appears to be a reasonable one. Soil pH was also estimated to range between 4 and 10, a range that in previous studies (summarized in Freter [1993]), appears to have no effect on the hydration process. Secondary Variables Secondary hydration variables were also considered in this anal ysis. It did not appear, based on both excavation context data and microscopic examination, that any of the dated artifacts were sub jected to fire or burning after their manufacture. In addition, given the enclosed nature of the tunnels, there was no apparent surface weathering of the hydration rims. Given the relatively recent time period under investigation, mechanical strain limitation of the hy dration rims, which usually appears after a rim has a depth of 50 microns or more, was not a factor with this set of artifacts. The last secondary variable, artifact reuse, through either reworking or edge wear, was investigated by measuring between 15 and 20 (the exact number depended upon the clarity of the slide and hydration rim) separate places along all exposed edges of the artifact slide. If great variations in rim widths were present on a single artifact, and they clustered on one side of the artifact, then it was identified as artifact reuse, and a different hydration-date estimate was pro duced for each side of the artifact. The artifact reuse encountered in the tunnels sample is very consistent with the occupation his tory of the site, and clearly demonstrates that reutilization of the tunnels occurred over a relatively long time span. Error Range of the Hydration Dates All hydration dates in this analysis were assigned a two-sigma stan dard deviation of ± 140 years. This error range is based on two error sources: first, the EHT estimate and, second, the hydration rim measurement. The ± 140 year error range is an extremely con servative one, based on the temperature data having a ± 1 °C in its estimate, and the hydration-rim measurement error having a vari ation of ± . 1 micron. DESCRIPTION OF CONTEXTS AND CERAMIC TYPES In the following section, dates are presented for each of the con texts sampled in the different tunnels. In most cases, this informa tion is accompanied by a descriptive summary of the context.

Burial 12 In CV C2 N337 E101 2a Z = 2287.75 m.o.s.l., at a depth of .13 .50 m, there was a Coyotlatelco neonate burial, in a flexed posi tion, associated with carbonized wood, ceramics, lithics, mica, animal bone, and two bowls to the north (RT 2666, 2267). Appar ently, the burial had been placed in a hole in the tuff. To the west there was a hearth. Pottery fragments consisted of flat-bottomed and orange bowl fragments, a Coyotlatelco decorated hemispher ical-bowl fragment, and a complete bowl made from a recycled cut jar. To the north of this activity area there was a bowl with a flat bottom, decorated on the interior with a white slip with orange stains, and on the exterior with a red band.

There was a large quantity of domestic pottery, particularly frag ments of large jars: Damajuana jars, buff-colored bowls, red banded bowls, Xico bowls (monochrome composite-silhouette bowl, following Good and Obermeyer [1986:244]), sealed bowls, orange incised bowls, Mazapan Red-on-brown decorated bowls, an orange comal rim similar to one reported by Cobean (1990) for the Terminal Corral phase, a textile-impressed pottery fragment, a Thin Orange bowl rim, and polychrome hemispherical-bowl frag ments. This is an activity area that shows the persistence of the Coyotlatelco pottery tradition into the Mazapan phase. We suspect that textile-impressed pottery for salt production also belongs to the Mazapan phase, if not to the Coyotlatelco phase. Maybe some of the lacustrine phytoliths (Judith Zurita, personal communica tion 1995) found in some activity areas may account for the trans portation of salty materials from the Texcoco region to the tunnels.
