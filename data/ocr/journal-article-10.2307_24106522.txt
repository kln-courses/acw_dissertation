This scientific explorer was also a great teacher, emphasizing demonstration and experiment. Somewhat later came C. V. Raman (1888-1970), the greatest of Indian scientists. Precocious (his first scien tific paper was published when he was about seven teen), indigenous and entirely self-taught, he was the natural scientist of the world of light and sound waves. The first half of his career (1907-1933) was spent in Calcutta and the remainder in Bangalore. He is best known for his discovery (Raman effect, discovered in 1928, Nobel Prize awarded in 1930) that photons inter acting with matter can change their frequency, the shift being characteristic of its internal excitations. Prior to this, photons were known to be fully absorbed (e.g. photoelectric effect) or scattered elastically (ordinary or Rayleigh scattering of light, or Compton effect). The Raman effect, is a new phenomenon probing the inter nal states of molecules and of condensed matter. Some of the other major discoveries of Raman are the origin of the musical nature of the tabla and the mridangam, the diffraction of light from stationary wavefronts of ultrasound in liquids, light scattering from polymers and from short-lived shear fluctuations in fluids, and the soft mode associated with structural phase transitions in solids. Raman's style was imaginative and incisive, doing relatively simple but often ingenious experiments to probe phenomena. He was primarily a research scien tist with a large number of research students over a long (~ 40 years) and productive scientific career; these stu dents helped shape physics in India for a generation or more. These two gifted experimental physicists, who flour ished towards the end of the classical period in physics (Bose) and when quantum mechanics was being born (Raman) worked at a phase of the subject when it was possible with meagre facilities (generally the norm) to make major qualitative discoveries. That period, as we all known, is history and two major realities the world over are 'big' science, or 'small' science (laboratory scale) with sophisticated tools. We will discuss below the Indian physics experience in these two categories, but before that, mention some other physicists who made major contributions. Satyendranath Bose ( 1894— 1974) was the first to realize the statistical mechanical consequences of identity in quantum physics (Bose Einstein statistics) and applied it to light or photons, thus inventing quantum statistical mechanics. Meghnad Saha (1893-1956) showed that the origin of unusual stellar line spectra is the presence of different ionic species in stellar matter due to thermal removal of elec trons, thus clarifying a great mystery in astrophysics and making it possible to know stellar temperatures. Saha was also active in public life, e.g. science and economic planning, calendar reform, a stint as nomi nated Member of Parliament, and founding and nurtur ing an Institute of Nuclear Physics in Calcutta, K.
