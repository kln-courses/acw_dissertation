<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charlotte Benton From Tubular Steel to Bamboo: Charlotte Perriand, the Migrating Chaise-longue and Japan The translation into bamboo, in Japan in 1940-1, of that most evocative of Modernist furniture designs of the 1920S, the tubular steel chaise-longue designed by Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand and Pierre Jeanneret, has long presented an enigma. This article explores both the larger background to, and the immediate circumstances of, this transformation. It also considers the legacies of Japanese craft production initiatives in the inter-war years to the development of Japanese industrial design in the early post-war years, and of Charlotte Perriand's experience of Japan to her post-war work.

The reality, how- ever, was rather different; Thonet produced the designs only in limited quantities-probably lar- gely as result of opposition from vested interests within the furniture trade.22 The designs were thus, effectively, consigned to the category of luxury furniture. The 'failure' of the venture with Thonet23 was one of several factors which may have prompted Perriand to adopt a less dogmatic approach to questions of form and materials in subsequent 6 Le Corbusier/C.

The pool of collectors and patrons, foreign or Japanese, able and willing to pay the high prices needed to sustain the labour-intensive and time-consuming practices of the most refined of the fine crafts was a limited and diminishing one [9]. And, for more run-of-the-mill skills, export markets could call the tune. In the l900s, H. G. Ponting recorded the extremes to which hybridization could now be taken and the 'commendable talents' of fine craft skills 'prostituted to unworthy causes' in - response to Western demands.

Less visible lessons from Japan would be drawn in the design of details: for example, Perriand adapted the prin- ciples employed in traditional Japanese architec- ture to ensure the smooth running of sliding elements in designs for sliding screens and parti- tions a' la japonaise (as used in her chalet at Me'ribel) and for the sliding doors of storage fitments intended for mass-production.

Perriand, upper floor of her own chalet at MWribel-les- Allues, 1960 text characteristically involved a critical appraisal of such traditions and methods to identify their 'transferable' potential, and demanded lateral thinking on the part of the executant. Thus a low 'trepied' stool-whose form was derived from peasant examples-was made by a Savoie black- smith. And a series of 'tables en forme' intended for one-off or small-batch production was exe- cuted by a carpenter, Jean Chetaille, with whom Perriand collaborated from the 1950S. Perriand has stressed how important to her it was that Chetaille was not a cabinet-maker and had few preconceived ideas about furniture-making. She valued not only his experienced sense of quality in the selection of appropriate and properly sea- soned woods, but also his ability to respond to challenges, and to conceptualize the proportional revisions necessary to make a design fit the dimensions of a particular piece of wood without compromising the character or intentions of the design."4' Examples such as these were, however, the exception rather than the rule in Perriand's post- war work, since they went against the grain of prevailing economic pressures. As Perriand acknowledged: Actuellement . . . les createurs de modeles sont dans une impasse. Oii bien on fait de 1'artisanat, oii bien de la serie. Dans le premier cas, autant s'orienter vers 1'artisanat pur, meme s'il fait figure de production de luxe. C'est pourquoi je dessine ces grosses tables en bois, que j'aime. Du moins sauvegarde-t-on ces belles 50 techniques artisanales qui tendent malheureusement a disparailtre et deviennent par le fait meme de plus en plus couiteuses.142 In so doing, she identified the central problem which had beset the practice of the traditional crafts in Japan from the Meiji period onwards. Yet if, as Morris-Suzuki suggests, the early post- war economic priorities of Japan had tended towards the wholesale jettisoning of generations of indigenous craft knowledge and practice, as design became increasingly important to Japanese production so there seems to have been an acknowledgement of the need to reinstate the fundamental qualities and values of the crafts as essential attributes of the practice of good design. As one of MITI's criteria for the G-mark design award, introduced in 1958, succinctly put it (my italics): The form and function of the product should work together in a way that is unique; the product should be able to be mass-produced economically using advanced tech- nology; the product design should enhance the natural quality of the material that it is made of and should be in touch with human nature.143 CHARLOTTE BENTON Cambridge Notes My thanks to Charlotte Perriand for answering ques- tions on this period and for permission to reproduce relevant illustrations of her work. This article originated in a short paper given at the conference 'Obscure Objects of Desire?', organized by Tanya Harrod, at the University of East Anglia, in January 1997, and was printed in the conference proceedings published under the same title by the Crafts Council in 1997. The paper has been extensively revised and extended for publica- tion here; my thanks to Tanya Harrod for her comments and suggestions on an earlier draft of this later version. i As a consequence it has been described as 'prob- ably the most machine-like in appearance' of the partnership's furniture designs.

However, it may be noted that Perriand has recorded that Le Corbusier was as interested in the image as in the Charlotte Benton</page><page sequence="21">reality of industrial production (quoted in M. di Puolo, M. Fagiolo &amp; M. L. Madama, La Machine a s'asseoir: Le Corbusier, Charlotte Perriand, Pierre Jean- neret, De Luca, Rome, 1976) and that Le Corbusier himself stressed the humanistic qualities of the design when he wrote: 'nous l'avons recouverte d'une magnifique fourrure de poulain; elle est legere au point d'etre pouss&amp;e avec le pied, man- oeuvr&amp;e par un enfant . . . Notre chaise-longue prend toutes les positions; mon poids seul suffit a la maintenir dans la position choisie; nulle m6ca- nique.' See Le Corbusier, Precisions (first published 1930), Editions Vincent, Freal &amp; Cie., Paris, 1960, pp. ii8, 121. Furthermore, the anthropomorphic qualities of the design seem self-evident. 2 Perriand's forthcoming memoirs, to be published by Odile Jacob, Paris, in Spring 1998, and the projected publication of the two-volume complete catalogue of her work edited by Roger Aujame should provide some correctives. 3 Notwithstanding the obvious limitations imposed by my reliance on Western sources. 4 Since it was-arguably-these and, in particular, the direction that Perriand's work had begun to take before she left France in 1940 that would predispose her to a sympathetic approach to the recreation of the design as craft. 5 On Perriand's life and work, see C. Perriand, Charlotte Perriand: un art de vivre, Musee des Arts Decoratifs/Flammarion, Paris, 1985; C. Benton, Charlotte Perriand: Modernist Pioneer, Design Museum, London, 1996. 6 Perriand used the phrase in an interview with Suzanne Tise in 1985. Literally translated this means 'an upholsterer's training'. As Perriand explained, she meant that the students were expected to acquire 'les techniques artisanales tra- ditionelles'. My thanks to Suzanne Tise for the loan of her tapes of this interview. 7 See previous note. 8 Notably the Salon d'Automne and the Salon of the Soci6t6 des Artistes-D6corateurs (SAD). 9 See the illustration of her 'Coin de Salon', shown at the 1926 SAD Salon, in Benton, op. cit., Fig. 1. 10 See Gustave Henriot's review of the SAD Salon, Mobilier et decoration, May 1927. Perriand was helped in this early success by the fact that her work was conspicuously well made, thanks to an introduction from Maurice Dufrene to his crafts- men.

Although Le Corbusier must have been a forbidding figure for the twenty-four-year-old Perriand, she thinks that with her 'new woman' image (hair cut a la Jose- phine Baker, short skirts and chromed ball-bearing necklace), she would probably have seemed rather formidable herself.

Wilk, Thonet: 150 years of Furni- ture, Barron's, New York, 1980, and G. Massobrio &amp; P. Portoghesi, La Seggiola di Vienna, Martano Edi- tore, Turin, n.d. [1970s]. 20 Le Corbusier wrote, apropos their use in the Pavil- lon de l'Esprit Nouveau at the 1925 Paris Exhibi- tion: 'Nous avons introduit . .. l'humble fauteuil Thonet de bois 6tuve, certainement le plus banal comme le meilleur marche des fauteuils. Et nous croyons que ce fauteuil, dont les millions d'exem- plaires meublent notre continent et les deux Am6r- iques, porte de la noblesse, tant sa pauvrete est un concentre des formes susceptibles de s'harmoniser au corps.' Le Corbusier, L'Almanach d'architecture moderne, Cres, Paris, 1925, p. 145. 21 See Perriand, Charlotte Perriand: un art de vivre, Fig. 7, for an illustration of the exhibit. 22 According to Perriand, retailers and traditional furniture makers mounted strong opposition to metal furniture on the grounds that it would undercut their business. Nevertheless, Thonet actively acquired rights to produce the steel furni- ture designs of a number of avant-garde designers in this period, so the question arises whether this initiative was intended as much to protect the Charlotte Perriand, the Migrating Chaise-longue and Japan 51</page><page sequence="22">interests of wood furniture manufacturers and retailers (including Thonet itself) as to any real intention to mass-produce these designs. Further- more, it seems likely that the acquisition of such designs would have provided Thonet with a high- profile image with which to promote the firm's more mundane stock. 23 However, the share of the royalty which came from those of the partnership's models which Thonet did produce helped to keep Perriand solvent since she-like the other assistants in the atelier-was not paid a salary by Le Corbusier. 24 Evidenced by such things as her membership of the Association des Ecrivains et Artistes Revolution- naires (AEAR) from the early 1930s, her 'manifesto' photomontage on 'la misere de Paris' in her exhibit at the Salon des Arts Managers in 1936, and her work for the Popular Front's Ministry of Agricul- ture exhibit at the 1937 Paris Exhibition. 25 In the mid-1930s, Perriand went on expeditions with Pierre Jeanneret and Fernand LUger to collect and photograph such objects. Examples of their photographs were shown in the Fernand Lager exhibition at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris in 1997. 26 This was, effectively, a long-standing interest. Jos&amp; Lluis Sert recorded that Perriand often arrived at the atelier with some 'adorable' new find, such as 'une modeste chaise de belles proportions, en bois et paille, table en bois, grosses planches, et tous les "defauts" du materiel bien visibles.' See J.-L. Sert, 'Charlotte Perriand', Aujourd'hui: art et architecture, no. 7, March 1956, pp. 58-9. Through skiing trips to the mountains Perriand became increasingly famil- iar, at this time, with peasant furniture types and methods of making. 27 See L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui, no. 1, January 1935, pp. 25-32. It was as a consequence of such work that Perriand would come to be seen as the creator of '[des] etudes si heureuses ... pour humaniser les doctrines rationalistes' (Decor d'aujourd'hui, no. 37, 1946, p. 59). 28 Perriand, Charlotte Perriand: un art de vivre, p. 27. The design drew on the example of a modest wooden chair with a rush seat, which Perriand had come across by chance; made by prisoners, the chair retailed at next to nothing. Perriand's design exploited the material for its structural properties (rather than disguising structure, as in her earliest independent work). 29 Perriand remembers Pierre Chareau, in particular, remonstrating with her. 30 As, for example, in the lightweight demountable mountain refuge in aluminium Perriand designed with Pierre Jeanneret in the late 1930S, and her work-with Pierre Jeanneret, Jean Prouv6, and Georges Blanchon-on designs for standardized, prefabricated, temporary wartime housing made in aluminium and intended to be delivered fully equipped. 31 See, for example, the irregularly shaped table designed for her own apartment (Benton, op. cit., Fig. 7) and the desk designed for the newspaper editor J. R. Bloch (Perriand, Charlotte Perriand: un art de vivre, Fig. 21). 32 Perriand was unaware of Japan's nationalist poli- tical agenda and pan-Asian ambitions. 33 For example, besides inviting foreign specialists to assist in the mechanization of the textile and cera- mics industries, and in the building of the railways, in the 1870S the Japanese commissioned Western architects and engineers to design a number of public buildings, as well as to teach Western-style building design and construction techniques. Between 1868 and 1900 alone several thousand foreign specialists were invited to Japan as advi- sers, entrepreneurs and teachers. 34 For some discussion of the period C.1868-1900, see J. Okada, 'Applied arts and handicrafts in Japan', in C. F. Yamada (ed.), Dialogue in Art: Japan and the West, Zwemmer, London, 1976, pp. 167-80, and F. Fischer, 'Japanese design: from Meiji to Modern', in K. B. Hiesinger &amp; F. Fischer, Japanese Design: A Survey since 1900, Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, 1994, pp. 8-13. On artistic relations between Japan and the West, see, in particular, G. Weisberg (ed.), Japonisme: Japanese Influence on French Art I854-1910, Cleveland Museum of Art, 1975 (reprinted 1988); and T. Sato &amp; T. Watanabe (eds.), Japan and Britain: An Aesthetic Dialogue I850- 1930, Lund Humphries, London, 1991. On Japanese technology, see T. Morris-Suzuki, The Technological Transformation of Japan, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1994. 35 The official Japanese report on the 1873 World's Fair in Vienna alone ran to ninety-six volumes. 36 Specialists were invited not only by central govern- ment but by regional and municipal organizations, as well as by individual firms. One of the most influential foreign specialists for the development of Japan's 'art industries' was the German chemist Gottfried Wagener (often mistakenly referred to as 'Wagner'). Invited to Japan as a consultant in i868, he stayed there until his death in 1892. He advised on technical improvements in various branches of porcelain manufacture, particularly in Arita, and 52 Charlotte Benton</page><page sequence="23">also had an influence on the development of cloi- sonne as an export-oriented craft. Wagener also assisted in the organization of the Japanese exhibits at the Vienna (1873) and Philadelphia (1876) World's Fairs, and that of the first National Exhibi- tion of Industrial Art held in Tokyo in 1877. In addition, he was actively involved in projects for the setting up of museums and technical schools in Japan. He also reported his experiences of Japan in German-language publications of the period. 37 For example, in the early 1870S two weavers and a specialist toolmaker from the weaving industry in Kyoto were dispatched to Lyons to study methods of production and master the use of mechanized looms. They took back to Japan a small number of Jacquard looms and a study collection of textiles samples. Installed in Kyoto, the looms were used to teach local weavers new methods, and to make samples. However, at least until the early years of the twentieth century, as Wilson Crewdson reported in 1910, a 'primitive' type of draw-loom remained in use for the more elaborate silk textiles, with 'the Jacquard loom ... as a rule only used for the less expensive silks and especially for fabrics in which cotton is mixed with silk'; see W. Crewdson, 'Japanese Art and Artists of Today III: Textiles and Embroidery', Studio, vols. LI-LII, 1910, pp. 40ff. 38 See previous note. 39 Sectoral associations included the Japan Textile Association, founded 1885. 40 Schools founded in this period included those in Tokyo, Osaka and Arita, and in Ishikawa and Kagawa prefectures. 41 An industrial museum was created in Kanazawa in Ishikawa prefecture in 1876 on the initiative of a local merchant and the local authority; in Kyoto a Hall of Weaving and a Hall of Dyeing were estab- lished, in 1877 and 188o respectively, to demon- strate new techniques to local artisans. See Morris- Suzuki, op. cit., pp. 92-3. 42 Besides being included in official Japanese govern- ment exhibits at World's Fairs from 1867 onwards, the development of the 'art industries' was encour- aged by officially sponsored exhibitions in Japan, such as the National Exhibitions for Industrial Art (sometimes referred to as the Exhibitions for the Encouragement of the Domestic Industries), the first of which was held in Tokyo in 1877, and the exhibitions of Design and Applied Works spon- sored by the Ministry of Agriculture and Com- merce from 1913 onwards. Morris-Suzuki notes the importance attached to exhibitions, national and international, by the Japanese government in promoting Japanese awareness of Japan's com- parative performance (Morris-Suzuki, op. cit., and see note 35). Also, according to Masanori Mor- oyama, exhibitions were one of the main means by which the crafts established a claim to parity with art. (See M. Moroyama in Modern Woodcraft, National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, n.d. [1987].) 43 For example, the shogunate and the daimyo had provided the main source of employment for lac- quer craftsmen; see J. Hutt &amp; 0. Impey, 'Japan', in Lacquer, Bracken Books, London, 1984, pp. 70-135. And the removal of the privileges of the samurai led to the abandonment of the wearing of the daisho (large and small paired swords), which resulted in a loss of livelihood for numerous specialist metal- workers and lacquerists. 44 For the traditional crafts, see J. Earle (ed.), Japanese Art and Design, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, 1986. 45 For examples of such work and a discussion of techniques, see A. Jackson, Japanese Country Tex- tiles, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, London, 1997. 46 Throughout the text I have often used the terms 'crafts' and 'industrial arts' more or less inter- changeably, partly because handcraft remained a salient feature of Japan's moves towards volume production well after the introduction of mechan- ization. I have also used the term 'fine crafts' to try to distinguish between those of the traditional crafts which were patronized by the elite in the Tokugawa period and by the Imperial Court and collectors in the Meiji period, and the traditional folk (sometimes called country) crafts which were practised by and accessible to a wider spectrum of Japanese society, and which-while they were of interest to ethnographers at this time-were not valued by collectors until much later on. 47 In former times particular craft specialisms (includ- ing particular designs or types of design) had tended to be based on families and passed from one generation to the next. (This practice was not specific to the crafts but was widespread and applied even within the liberal professions.) L. Deschesne, in his book La Concurrence du Japon (Librairie de la Societ6 du Recueil General des Lois et des Arrets, Paris, 1905) observed that 'les progres de la grande industrie sont en train de modifier cet 6tat des choses' (p. 17). 48 For example, aniline dyes increasingly replaced vegetable and mineral dyes, especially in the production of cheaper textiles (though also in silk). Interestingly, a contemporary commentator Charlotte Perriand, the Migrating Chaise-longue and Japan 53</page><page sequence="24">attributes much of the initial blame for the decline in quality of production to foreign exporters 'who had them [crafts for export] manufactured in the treaty ports and in the interior at the lowest prices, since their whole aim was to make as much money as possible. The artisans themselves forsook to a great degree the old patterns and the old methods of work, and sought eagerly for new forms and decorations to please European taste, which hitherto they had not known. The most tasteless things . . . thus reached their market and found their customers.' See J. J. Rein, The Indus- tries of Japan, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, London, 1889, p. 328. 49 See M. Eidelberg &amp; W. R. Johnston, 'Japonisme and French decorative arts', in Weisberg, op. cit., pp. 141-55. For the example of the production of fakes in lacquer, see Hutt &amp; Impey, op. cit. 50 Eidelberg &amp; Johnston (see previous note) observe that, by the 189os, Siegfried Bing had become 'disdainful of the lowered quality of goods coming out of the East', and that the growing 'rapprochement between modern French decora- tive arts and a Japanese aesthetic' by this time 'made it easy for Bing ... to switch the emphasis of his business from orientalia to goods reflecting the modern style.' In England A. L. Liberty and E. W. Godwin were amongst those who were critical of this hybridization and decline in quality; see Sato &amp; Watanabe, op. cit. 51 Which was detailed in a thirty-volume report on the economy compiled between 1882 and 1884 by a government official. (See Morris-Suzuki, op. cit., p. 99.) Perhaps surprisingly, Christopher Dresser's Japan: its Architecture, Art and Art Manufactures (Longman, Green &amp; Co., London, 1882), gives little sense of this crisis. However, it should be remembered that, when Dresser visited Japan, travel was restricted for foreigners, and that, as a guest of the Japanese government, he may have been particularly shielded from evidence of such problems. 52 Significantly, it was a Westerner, the American scholar Ernest Fenollosa (1853-1908), who had arrived in Japan in 1878 to teach political economy and who became absorbed by Japanese art and culture, who-together with his student Tenshin Okakura-led the campaign to conserve and pro- mote the traditional arts. By 1929 some 3,500+ objects had been designated and more than 1,ooo buildings identified as worthy of protection. See Yearbook of Japanese Art, 1929-30, pp. 11o-i6. 53 Such as the Lacquer Artists' Association of Japan, 1889. 54 Athough it seems to have been a central purpose of the early schools to develop skills in Western-style 'art industries', and particularly in the use of materials and techniques not widely used in Japan (such as glass-making), they were also used to promote the traditional crafts, such as lacquer- work. 55 Yearbook of Japanese Art, 1929-30, p. 117. The number of posts, originally fixed at twenty, was increased in 1906 to twenty-five, which is perhaps an indication of the success of these initiatives in promoting the fine crafts in the early years of the century. However, by the late 1920S there were substantial numbers of vacant posts. In 1928, the Yearbook reported that 'the artists number only eight', of whom one was an architect, one a photo- grapher, and the remainder 'painters in the Japan- ese style' (p. 29), and by 1931 this number had been reduced to six (Yearbook, 1931-2, p. 117), despite a number of initiatives to promote the arts to com- memorate Emperor Hirohito's accession in 1928. For some examples of the type of work produced, see V. Harris, Japanese Imperial Craftsmen: Meiji Art from the Khalili Collection, British Museum Press, London, 1994. 56 Morris-Suzuki, op. cit., pp. 99-100. 57 Rein, op. cit., p. 328. 58 In Modern Woodcraft, op. cit. Some explanation of the rise of the woodcrafts is suggested by Rein who, noting the former absence of individualized styles of cabinet-making because of 'the very simple way of living . . . among all classes of Japanese people', observed that 'in modem times and with the necessity to furnish the houses of foreigners and natives after the European style, artistic cabinet-making has been developed and attempted with growing success.' Rein, op. cit., P. 335. 59 Rein, op. cit., p. 328. 6o H. G. Ponting, In Lotus-Land Japan, Macmillan, London, 1910, pp. 49-50. 61 Extrapolated from the tables given in Rein, op. cit., PP. 544-5. 62 See previous note. 63 This success was aided by the coincidence of blight in other important areas of silk production with the period when Japan entered the export market. 64 Early exports of hand-spun silk proved too uneven for use in the European silk industry. But the export of yarn increased significantly from the 1870s, when mechanized spinning was introduced 54 Charlotte Benton</page><page sequence="25">to supply the kind of even textured silk required. Early attempts to export silk textiles also encoun- tered difficulties, since the cost of quality Japanese silk textiles was higher than that of European silk textiles of comparable quality; and the widths in which silk was traditionally woven in Japan were narrower than those in general use in Europe. 65 Sold at first mainly to markets in the East. 66 As an example of a European manufacturer copy- ing the techniques and/or imagery of the Japanese crafts, the Birmingham silversmiths Elkington and Co. began successfully producing cloisonne wares in the Japanese syle from the 1870s. (As an ex- ample, see the cloisonne enamel on gilt metal vase made by Elkington in 1876 in the V &amp; A; museum no. 562-1877.) In France, too, a number of produ- cers, including ceramics and glass makers, adopted Japanese imagery and techniques (see Weisberg, op. cit.). 67 In 1929 raw silk, silk textiles, cotton yarn and cotton textiles accounted for 63% of Japan's exports by value. 68 Deschesne, op. cit., pp. 4, 21. 69 Predominantly in the Pacific, South America, and Africa, but also including the USA. 70 C. Amero, Le Japon d'hier et d'aujourd'hui, Hatier, Paris, n.d. [c.19o6], in his chapter 'Les arts et l'industrie' (pp. 233-61) notes growing Western fears of Japanese competition in the former's mar- kets (particularly in Asia), and the emergence of 'd'impudentes contrefaqons'. 71 Morris-Suzuki, op. cit., pp. 1oo-1. 72 H. A. Phillips, Meet the Japanese, J. J. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia and London, 1932, pp. 69-71. These moves did not, however, stem the production of poor-quality crafts for export, as both Phillips and Leslie Johns record. Johns describes a visit to a lacquer workshop where he found two distinct classes of production: 'One cheap, mostly very gaudy, sold abroad at great profit as "the real thing", and the other extremely fine, carefully executed in the best of taste, by no means cheap, and requiring a very great deal of careful and intensive labour.' See L. W. Johns, Japan: Reminis- cences and Realities, Stanley Paul &amp; Co., London, n.d. [1930s], p. 90. 73 Phillips, op. cit. 74 H. G. Moulton, Japan: An Economic and Financial Appraisal, Faber &amp; Faber, London, 1932, pp. 131-2. (The study was undertaken for the Brookings Insti- tution.) Moulton notes that 'notwithstanding the growth of capitalistic enterprise and the economic expansion of the last thirty years, Japanese indus- trial establishments remain on the whole extremely small in size as measured by occidental standards. Indeed, it may fairly be said that small-scale indus- try is still the rule in Japan.' The table on p. 132 shows that at this time nearly 50% of Japanese factories employed fewer than ten workers, and the total number of factories employing over 500 workers was under 6oo. 75 Present Day Japan, 1929, p. II1. 76 Especially in the public services, the professions and in the larger commercial concerns; schoolchil- dren also wore Western-style clothing. 77 Y. Ninomiya, 'Features of the Japanese department store', Travel in Japan, vol. VI, no. i, 1940, pp. 19-21. But the extent of the penetration of such goods into Japanese households is likely to have been very limited before the Second World War, since the domestic lifestyles of the overwhelming majority of Japanese remained traditional, and Japan was, overall, a low-wage economy. Thus, as Morris- Suzuki observes, 'changes in household technology were slow and uncertain' and 'few families could afford many electrical gadgets, and items like refrigerators and washing machines remained a rarity' (Morris-Suzuki, op. cit., pp. 129-30). 78 Ninomiya, op. cit. Department stores existed in Japan before the 1920S, but they were popularized in the period of reconstruction after the Great Earthquake and thereafter made a deliberate effort to appeal to a wide public by offering a wide range of goods and services, with a conse- quent effect on the fortunes of smaller retailers. Bernard Leach noted the huge changes which had taken place in Tokyo and other urban centres during the 1920S, when he returned to Japan in the mid-1930s: 'I confess I rubbed my eyes with astonishment, this was certainly not the Japan I had left behind in 1920 . . . ' See Leach, 'Impressions of Japan after fourteen years', Kogei, no. 53, May 1935, p. 10. 79 B. H.

Taut, 'The Japanese village', Travel in Japan, vol. 2, no. 3, 1936, pp. 22-8. 82 The figure for rural income is given by Taut (see previous note). Taut also quotes a figure for the agricultural population (apparently based on official Charlotte Perriand, the Migrating Chaise-longue and Japan 55</page><page sequence="26">statistics) of 80%; other contemporary and more recent sources give a much lower figure than this for the rural population. 83 A semi-official Japanese publication of the mid- 1930S admitted that 'agricultural progress has lagged partially because the agricultural method of feudal days is still being used.' See Empire Founding Commemorative Enterprise Society, Japan in Advance, 2 vols., Nakaya Mitsuma Printing Co., Tokyo, n.d. [19361, vol. II, p. 17. 84 Nevertheless, raw silk, silk yarn and silk textiles still accounted for a sizeable chunk of Japan's export economy in 1934 (18% by value), although thereafter they declined in importance. Despite this blow to its rural industry, Japan was quick to respond to emerging trends. Thus, already by the early 1930s it ranked second to the USA in rayon production and, though output was far behind that of the USA, had plans for expansion. Japan had also begun a 'unique' development which com- bined rayon and silk to produce fine textiles with the appearance of silk but which were both cheaper and had more 'modern' handling properties than real silk. 85 Taut, 'The Japanese village', op. cit. 86 See previous note. Taut wrote: 'in their daily work they still use tools, implements, baskets, nets, etc., made in the best traditions of their crafts, of most beautiful appearance and much more so than those of their like in any other country.' 87 Japan in Advance, op. cit., vol.

The Museum was financed by a wealthy Japanese busi- nessman and philanthropist Magosaburo Ohara, who also founded a Folk Museum and an Art Gallery at Kurashiki (a folk pottery producing centre known to Leach), near Okayama. 92 See K. Muraoka &amp; K. Okamura, Folk Arts and Crafts of Japan, Weatherhill/Heibonsha, New York and Tokyo, for the chapter titled 'Recent changes in folk crafts', pp. 151-7. 93 Japan's participation in the 1925 Paris Exhibition and the return of Japanese students who had trained in European avant-garde offices and insti- tutions (such as the Bauhaus) undoubtedly con- tributed to this interest. In addition, there were exhibitions of European work in Japan, such as those of contemporary French decorative arts organized by the Franco-Japanese Art Society in Tokyo. There were also some high-profile commis- sions to Western architects and designers at this time: in addition to Frank Lloyd Wright's design for the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, Henri Rapin-a leading French artiste-decorateur (and one of Char- lotte Perriand's teachers)-was commissioned to design the interiors of Prince Yasuhiko's house at Shirogane, Tokyo. A number of new groups were formed and periodicals launched which reflected this greater diversity of interests and practice. In addition a boost was given to the status of the crafts/industrial arts in 1927 by their inclusion, for the first time, in the annual 'Teiten' exhibition organized by the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts. 94 See Hiesinger &amp; Fischer, op. cit., and S.

Viatte et al., Le Japon des avant gardes, 1910-1970, Centre Pompidou, Paris, 1986. 95 For some discussion of linguistic shifts in the early twentieth century, see Toyojiro Hida's essay in Design in Transition, 1868-1945, National Museum of Modem Art, Tokyo, 1988, pp. 34ff. 96 Sendai was the largest city in north-eastern Japan and the political, economic and cultural centre for the region. For some discussion of the Institute, see Hiesinger &amp; Fischer, op. cit. 97 In 1925 the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce was divided to form separate minis- tries. The activities of the research section do not seem to have been studied in any detail, but it seems likely, from illustrations of prototypes, that it encouraged the direct imitation of Western models. See Design in Transition, op. cit., Figs. 199-202. 98 It is possible that Perriand's Japanese colleagues at the rue de S&amp;vres received some official support for their studies, especially since the reconstruction which followed the Great Earthquake of 1923 put a premium on knowledge of new constructional techniques. 99 The name is recorded by Charlotte Perriand in an article written during her stay in Japan. I have so far been unable to discover details of Schreeman's background and specialism, and would be glad to hear from anyone with information on these. 100 This episode in Taut's life has been largely ignored by architectural historians; my account is depen- dent on the brief discussion of these years which appears in Felice Fischer's 'Japanese design: from Meiji to Modern', in Hiesinger &amp; Fischer, op. cit. 101 The particular emphasis he gave to production quality would be influential for those Japanese designers then associated with the Institute who 56 Charlotte Benton</page><page sequence="27">would emerge to prominence in the early post-war years, such as Isamu Kenmochi and Riki Watanabe. 102 Fischer records that Inoue wanted to revive local craft production and that Taut was associated with Inoue's workshop at Takasaki for some two years during which he produced designs for several hundred items, including furniture, lights, trays and bowls, which were sold through the Miratesu craft shop in Tokyo from 1935. It is not clear whether these designs were also intended for export. 103 Japan in Advance, op. cit., vol. II, p. 187. 104 Sori Yanagi was the son of Soetsu Yanagi; then a student, he was later to become well known as a designer. Although Perriand has said that Yanagi (now curator of the Folk Craft Museum established by his father in Tokyo in 1935) did not share all his father's views, it is probable that he was able to point out to Perriand on her travels the kind of work particularly admired by Yanagi senior. 105 P.

Ferdinand Barbedienne (1810-92) was a leading Second Empire furniture manufacturer and bronze founder, and the key figure in the exhibit of French bronze work shown at the World's Fair of 1878. Barbedienne had himself been inspired by Japanese cloisonne' work. J. J. Rein wrote: 'Of all Frenchmen he has accomplished most in general bronze manufacture, and especially in the employment of imbedded enamel, and is almost certainly the only one who has succeeded in imitating Japanese cloisonne' enamel and using it as surface decoration.' Rein, op. cit., p. 332. 111 Quoted in Renous, op. cit. 112 See C. Perriand &amp; J. Sakakura, Contact avec lart japonais: tradition, selection, creation, Kujio Koyama, Tokyo, 1941. 113 Information from Charlotte Perriand. 114 Perriand possesses letters from some of the latter which describe their frustrations with the way in which they were being taught, and their enthu- siasm for Perriand's approach. 115 Renous, op. cit.; and information from Charlotte Perriand. ii6 The Takashimaya was one of the big six of the developing phenomenon of the department store in Japan. The use of department stores for exhibi- tions was already well established. As Ninomiya explained: 'The Japanese department store ... does not confine itself to the selling of merchandise. For the tens and hundreds of thousands of customers who crowd the store, the management offers a variety of attractions and free services: exhibitions of arts and crafts, of products from all parts of the country and those to stimulate public interest in national affairs are periodically held in the spa- cious salons invariably found in the Japanese department store...' (see Ninomiya, op. cit.). 117 See note 112. ii8 Information from Charlotte Perriand. 119 It may also be the case that new health and safety legislation had an effect on the practice of some crafts, especially those such as lacquering which were known to carry health risks. J. J. Rein had drawn attention to these in his description of lacquering processes (Rein, op. cit.), and Johns noted the discomforts of a lacquering workshop (Johns, op. cit.). It may be remembered that, in the early 1920S, the Paris-based designer Eileen Gray had to abandon lacquering because of its effect on her health. 120 Some rural crafts, such as rush weaving, survived in pockets because of the sustained demand for such things as tatami covers, and for new products such as table mats; with the spread of electricity in rural areas came powered looms. The numbers of artisans making hand tools dwindled, as mass- produced alternatives proliferated and as mechan- ical devices replaced some hand-tools. Western dress became more usual, with the result that the hand-loom for the weaving of cotton textiles began to be replaced by the sewing machine. See R. K. Beardsley, J. W. Hall &amp; R. E. Ward, Village Japan, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1959. 121 For a history of the post-war Japanese crafts as 'art' and for a discussion of contemporary practice, see R.

Charlotte Perriand, the Migrating Chaise-longue and Japan 57</page><page sequence="28">123 T. R. Havens, writing in the early 198os, estimated the number of 'professional' craftspeople in Japan as about 3,500 (compared with about 30,000 profes- sional artists). See Havens, Artist and Patron in Postwar Japan: Dance, Music Theater and the Visual Arts, 1955-1980, Princeton University Press, 1982, P. 7. 124 See Faulkner, op. cit. 125 Leach recorded, in the early 1950s, the 'semi-indus- trialization' which had overtaken the pottery centre of Seto, and that in the former silk-weaving village of Kinumura he saw 'some fine traditional silk weaving in a sort of experimental institute' but that, whilst the hand-weaving was 'expert', the quality of the design was 'dreadful' and 'bad synthetic dyes' had replaced 'good vegetable dyes'. See B. Leach, A Potter in Japan 1952-1954, Faber &amp; Faber, 1960, pp. 57, 115. 126 See Morris-Suzuki, op. cit., pp. 136, i8l. 127 Major potential markets for low-cost goods, such as the USSR and China, were now completely closed to Japan as a result of her alliance, in the Cold War, with the USA. 128 Morris-Suzuki characterizes Japan's approach to new technology as predominantly 'intermediate' and adaptive during the second half of the nine- teenth and first half of the twentieth century. (See Morris-Suzuki, op. cit.). 129 See Penny Sparke's article on the crafts in post-war Italy elsewhere in this issue. 130 Morris-Suzuki, op. cit., p. 120. 131 Including the Creative Art Education Institute (1951), Kuwazawa Design School (1954), and Visual Art Education Centre (1955). Bernard Leach bitterly criticized the failure of the schools of design in this period to capitalize on Japan's rich inheritance of distributed craft skills and know- ledge; as he saw it, such institutions, 'instead of fostering the remnants of Japanese craftsmanship ... are bent upon importing foreign plants and making them grow upon Japanese soil whether they want to or not.' Noting that, in Shizuoka, the municipal- ity had just spent ?1oo,ooo on creating a school of industrial design-'yet another lifeless error'-he observed that a fraction of the money spent on creating schools of design 'which are fast destroy- ing handcraft traditions' could 'work wonders in preserving and adapting, and even in exporting Japanese handcrafts alongside improved indust- rially-designed goods.' Leach, A Potter in Japan, op. cit. pp. 186-7. 132 Such as the Japan Advertising Artists Club (1951), Japan Industrial Designers' Association (1952), and Japan Interior Designers' Association (1958). 133 For the history of Japanese design since the Second World War, see, in particular, Hiesinger &amp; Fischer, op. cit., and the relevant chapters in Takashina &amp; Viatte, op. cit.; also P.

Other exam- ples of Perriand's renewed links with Japan after the war were her organization of a Japanese tea house exhibit at the 1957 Salon des Arts Menagers. The intention here was not to emphasise backward- looking rituals, but to draw attention to those elements of traditional Japanese architectural prac- tice which were relevant to contemporary French architectural concerns. Perriand also selected Noguchi lamps and Japanese folkcraft pottery for the Galerie Steph Simon for which she acted as consultant. 141 Information from Charlotte Perriand. 142 Renous, op. cit. 143 Quoted by K.
