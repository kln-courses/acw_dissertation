He asserts  that Russia and the Russian language remain a defi ning infl uence in the lives  of millions of émigrés to the West and citizens of post-Soviet countries, even  where local nationalist agendas seek to downplay and underestimate the preva- lence of Russian. These people are the members of the “Russian world.” They  include those who “preserve ties of culture and identity with Russia, many of  whom in fact have Russian citizenship and consider themselves fi rst and fore- most Russian citizens, even if they live outside of Russia,” but also include all  Russian speakers whose connection to Russian language and culture remains a  prominent component in their identity.  Tishkov, writing for an English-speaking audience, explains how and why  Russian intellectuals began to press the government of the Russian Federation  to embrace the idea that there was a “Russian world” and to support its mem- bers. Through colorful personal anecdotes as well as historical analysis, Tishkov  also explores the character of the earlier waves of emigration from Russia to the  West and the identity of descendants of Russian-speaking emigrants, offering  an explanation as to why some continued to feel a connection to Russia and  others did not.  Although many of the issues that confront the Russian-speaking world  affect other diasporas as well, Tishkov claims a unique character for the Russian  world—its connection to the legacy of a supranational state with many  different ethnicities and languages. The history of the Soviet period, in which  he sees the promulgation of the Russian language as a tool of modernization,  makes it more diffi cult to classify and measure “native” and “non-native” speak- ers among those in the post-Soviet states who are also fl uent in their national  language.  In the most provocative sections of his paper, Tishkov argues that  conventional  estimates of the prevalence and social importance of Russian in post-Soviet  countries such as Georgia, Latvia, and some Central Asian states are distorted  by skewed self-reporting, willful suppression of Russian by the governments,  1 </page> <page sequence="6"> 2 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies and other biases. For this reason he believes that Russian should become an offi - cial language in several former Soviet republics, including Kazakhstan, Ukraine,  and Latvia, due to the high proportion of Russian speakers there.  The subjects Tishkov touches upon speak to the continuing search for the  meaning of “Russianness” in the post-Soviet context. After the dissolution of  the Soviet Union left millions of ethnic Russians in the “near abroad,” a Russian  term for those countries formerly Soviet republics, identifying and making  sense of Russia’s new borders was the central concern of Russian intellectuals  and scholars seeking to defi ne their nation.  For millions of people living in  new countries, a quest to seek an authentic national identity led to a struggle  between the infl uence of titular cultures and language and Russian. As a result,  the changing status and perception of the Russian language in the newly inde- pendent states refl ect ongoing processes of national consolidation and self-un- derstanding. Tishkov’s analysis helps to shed light on how Russians are navigat- ing these challenging questions.   Martha Brill Olcott Gregory Dubinsky </page> <page sequence="7"> Valery Tishkov | 3 Introduction Gorbachev’s liberalization brought the opening of Russia to the outside world  and with it interest in and contact with the Russian1 diaspora.2 After the dis- solution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), the problem of the  diaspora evolved quickly, when it was transformed into a political and even a  humanitarian challenge.  Unlike the earlier diaspora, most of this new community had not emigrated  from Russia, but rather were displaced from Russia because international bor- ders had shifted and the Russian state had shrunk. As early as the beginning of  the 1990s, these people came to be called “Russian fellow countrymen” (rossi- iskie sootechestvenniki), or “countrymen abroad” (zarubezhnye sootechestven- niki), terms that were problematic from a legal standpoint, as “countrymen” are  usually seen as bearers of identical passports.  Nevertheless, it is more or less clear who is referred to here—people who  preserve ties of culture and identity with Russia, many of whom in fact have  Russian citizenship and consider themselves to be fi rst and foremost Russian  citizens, even if they live outside of Russia on a temporary or permanent basis.  They belong to a “Russian world” (Ruskii mir), a term only recently in use in  Russian social science discourse.3 The term most frequently refers to the world  of Russians living outside of Russia, in the Russian diaspora, and has a his- torical and cultural-linguistic character, something akin to “fellow countrymen  abroad.” The last few years have seen the publication of many directories, collec- tions of documents, studies, and journalistic pieces devoted to the subject of  Russians abroad,4 and there have been numerous conferences on the subject.5  The Internet has an entire network of Russian resource sites (a Google search  on “russkoye zarubezhiye” [Russians abroad]6 returns 2 million links, as does a  search on “Russkiye v Amerike” [Russians in America”]). The problems of the  so-called new Russian diaspora—or more precisely the situation of Russians  living in the newly independent states (NIS) and the fate of Russian language  and culture there—are also of great interest to scholars and politicians. There  have been many scholarly books published on the subject, 7 and hundreds, even  thousands of articles. As for political statements and various speculative pro- nouncements, these exist in enormous quantity. There is no doubt that we are  dealing with a phenomenon that has a long history but which today has ac- quired a different confi guration and meaning, having become a part of new  communities networked together, as well as a part of state politics and interna- tional relations. 3 </page> <page sequence="8"> 4 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies I have written about the problems of the diaspora and the Russian popula- tions in the former Soviet countries in various earlier works,8 but given newly  published materials on the issue and sparked in part by President Vladimir  Putin’s declaration of 2007 as the “Year of the Russian Language,” I decided  to prepare the current article that analyzes the scholarly understandings and  political connotations of the “Russian world” doctrine. It does so by laying out  the history of the Russian diaspora and the prospects for the “Russian world.” It  also evaluates Russia’s relations with the Russian world and seeks to offer policy  recommendations for its politicians and governors. The Russian World as Humanitarian  Challenge and Political Project A group of intellectuals from Russia were pioneers in setting the elaboration  of “the Russian world” as a philosophical project, including most prominently  Gleb Pavlovskiy, Petr Shchedrovitskiy, Sergey Chernyshev, Yefi m Ostrovskiy,  and Maksim Shevchenko. Some of these men had ties to the Ukraine and  Crimea and seemed more keenly aware of the problems of state collapse and  the need to help those now living beyond the borders of the Russian Federation  who primarily identifi ed themselves with Russia and Russian culture.  In the beginning of the 1990s Gleb Pavlovskiy raised the problem of the  “Russian revival” in his correspondence from Odessa with Chernyshev:  There are diffi culties being Russian. Speaking Russian, even calling one’s self  Russian, is diffi cult, and this diffi culty is growing all the time, threatening to  become a daily fact, and it is impossible to live without naming it, and without  naming one’s self. The destruction of the USSR, the drowning of “Soviet” in the  River Lethe, has not returned his former rights to the Russian. That word today  resonates not so much with identity as with concern about identity. There is  nothing simplistic here, nothing but challenges, in the name of lost worthiness.  This loss has become a fact, and it more fully distinguishes Russians and their  older name—distinguishes, but does not draw them closer....9  There is no doubt that for Russian intellectuals from Odessa, such as  Pavlovskiy, or from other parts of the former USSR no longer within Russia’s  borders, the problem of Russian self-identity (both legal and ethnic) was much  more signifi cant and pressing.  Some people, like Professor Yuri Lotman of Tartu University,10 tried to take  on a new self-identity, identifying with the Estonians (in the Soviet era them- selves the minority), even becoming one of them. But such efforts were few and  mostly unsuccessful.  Moving to Russia became the most acceptable lifestyle choice for many.  Some of these people, like Konstantin Zatulin,11 became prominent politicians  and political spokesmen for the Russian-speaking populations in the FSU (for- mer Soviet Union). Some created formal and informal groups, such as think  tanks, that have had a signifi cant infl uence on politics, primarily by providing  </page> <page sequence="9"> Valery Tishkov | 5 the upper echelons of Russian state power with a steady supply of experts. Some  of their suggestions became Russian state objectives, and others eventually state  policy. This includes the plans for the “Russian world,” which took over ten  years to become a formal policy. The history of this project merits analysis. In 1993 the Russian Institute and Russkiy Zhurnal were founded in Moscow,  headed (as they are today) by Gleb Pavlovskiy, but it was not until 2000, when  Shchedrovitskiy and Sergei Gradirovskiy began the network project Russkiy Mir  (Russian World) through the Internet portal Russkiy Arkhipelag. The materials that  they have assembled there allow us to see how the “Russian world” evolved.12 According to Petr Shchedrovitskiy, “the idea arose in the period between  1993 and 1997, gradually crystallizing from a pre-understanding, an amor- phous sense of the necessary form, to the completed name.” Shchedrovitskiy  laid out what he termed the “geo-cultural blueprint” of the “Russian world” in  the following way: “the social, cultural, and general human world is a unity of  will and imagination. If nothing stands behind the idea of the Russian World  except words, if there are no actions, if there is no component of the will, then  of course there will be no Russian World. Precisely as would have happened  had not tens, then hundreds, then thousands of people begun to form a Greater  Europe, then it too would of course not have come about.” In this sense the Russian world is a “networked structure of large and small  communities that think in and speak the Russian language.”13 “Admitting the  existence of a Russian world allows us to speak of ‘Russian capital,’ an aggregate  of cultural, intellectual, human, and organizational potentials, which express  themselves in the linguistic thought processes and communicative (humanistic)  resources of the Russian language. The energy of will of various ethno-cultural  groups that think and speak in Russian permits their potential to be realized,  turning this into a series of images of the future.”14 The Russian world is not an  aggressive world, but rather a progressive one, not trying to expand its territory,  but rather being present in the cultural space, in the consciousness of people  scattered across the globe. “To create a new image for Russia, the country that  never was, means to take part in the ongoing re-division of the world, to make  a Velvet Revanche after our country’s defeat in the Third World War, the Cold  War,”15 Shchedrovitskiy wrote in 1999. I am omitting several complex arguments made by this famous “methodolo- gist,” who was attracted to the writings of the “great scholar Lev Gumilev,”16  particularly his idea of “passionarity” (passionarnost) in the actions of groups of  humans, or ethnoses,17 as well as the possible complementarity of their behav- ior. I cannot, however, fail to cite one clarifi cation that P. Shchedrovitskiy of- fered in his interview that bore the weighty title, “Who and What Stand Behind  the Doctrine of the Russian World?”:  Behind the doctrine of the Russian World there stands a fundamental proposition  about the complementarity of our culture to world development. That is, I affi rm,  because of the specifi cs of language, the basic ability of various languages to  </page> <page sequence="10"> 6 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies express or not express various aspects of thought and content, the solution of  global problems of development require various languages and cultures; and, in  this sense, various ways of thinking (which bring with them various ways of  acting). These are necessary because when we encounter global problems, we  would then be able to establish the cooperation and communication of cultures.  The doctrine I am espousing is based on the proposition that the twenty-fi rst  century will be an age of multicultural dialogue.18  And, since this will be a dialogue and a competition among cultural systems,  what might Russia offer after the Cold War? “Is Russia’s foreign policy secure in  a human and technological way?” Yefi m Ostrovskiy and Petr Shchedrovitskiy  ask in the article “Russia, the Country that Wasn’t.”  In a simpler form, this “securing” is called the creation of Russia’s image,  which is described as “not a luxury for the rich” but rather “an irreplaceable in- strument of foreign policy for the new generation ... a necessary condition for  Russia’s existence in the world of nations in the twenty-fi rst century.”19 The concern over Russia’s unrealized modernization (before the Putin  presidency) preoccupied many Russian experts, including the authors of the  Russian world. However, they saw the recipe for the country’s return to health  differently than did, for example, the nationalist-isolationists or the imperial  revanchists.  The state that arose on the territory of the Russian Federation at the start of  the 1990s was not an adequate form for the inclusion of Russian society in the  world’s historical process. In the place of the more-or-less competitive scientifi c  and engineering community that was responsible for two-thirds of the world’s  inventions and discoveries, there was created a completely non-competitive   pseudo-oligarchic class and a society of petty shopkeepers, who were a feeding  ground for extremist parties.20  In the view of the authors, the existing social degradation was offset by the  large global Russian diaspora. More than half of the world’s Russians live out- side of Russia, including an entire range of world-class professional communi- ties, such as computer programmers, who are recruited in large numbers from  among Russian emigrants. “Thus it is already possible today to speak of the  formation of a sort of ‘hammock,’ in which the Russian Federation is, as it were,  suspended in a net of connections and relationships that are supported from  outside the country.”21  The authors were also attracted to theories that argued how one great battle  in the world must be followed by another, believing that after three world wars  (the Cold War being the third) there will be a fourth—the battle for the legacy  of the USSR and the Eastern Bloc. This war will not be for new territories, but  rather for the expansion of ties between the people and those states that inhabit  the World of Worlds. “It is being decided today whether our country will enter  the twenty-fi rst century as a Great Power or whether its territory and resources  (material and intellectual) will enter the century as simply one of the stakes  </page> <page sequence="11"> Valery Tishkov | 7 that goes to the winner ... to create Russia’s image today means to create a new  system of connections between Russians—the Russian World in the context of  geo-economics and world cultural policies.”22  The authors and participants of this project, which at the beginning was  entirely intellectual, explained that they were not speaking of a “Russian geopo- litical world” in the form of the CIS, nor about a “Eurasian continental bloc”  that Alexander Dugin23 and his supporters advocate. Neither were they speak- ing about some other military–strategic alliance meant to guarantee Russia’s  security and position in the post-Soviet space. Nor does the project have as its  goal the isolationist one of “returning Russia to its uniqueness as a civilization”  (which was the “Russian Islands” project of Vadim Tsymburskiy24) or some  trivial integration of our country with western civilization, becoming part of  the cultural–historical and political core.  But then what were they talking about? According to P. Shchedritskiy, they  were talking about “replacing the vanishing subjects of world development, na- tional states and, through a technical knockout, new ones will emerge, among  which the world’s diasporas, large transregional unities, or strategic alliances of  countries, world-cities (the infrastructural knots of the world’s geo-economic  net) and anthropomorphic structures (aggregated groups and associations us- ing networked forms of organization for their activities and cultural policies for  active participation in the world’s processes).”25 All of this metaphoric journalism had an infl uence on many of the young  people who were drawn into working on Russkiy Zhurnal’s projects, as well  as on some politicians and more traditional scholars. The idea that it was not  national governments but rather diasporas, as networked communities, that  would now be the major world players gained currency in various articles and  books and also in some quasi-offi cial Foreign Ministry and state programs26  that were focused on “countrymen abroad,” as ethnic Russians living outside of  the country were termed.  The idea of a kind of assigned role, or “mission of the Russian world” proved  to be inspiring against the background of primitive nationalist and isolationist  constructs, and is an idea that still has emotional and ethical signifi cance, and  helps shape policy goals and their realization.  For example, in an interview article entitled “The Mission of the Russian  World,” Boris Kruming-Sukharev, co-chairman of the International Association  “Russkaya Kultura” and head of that organization’s center in Estonia, explained  that the creation of the Russian world was intended to “carry a mission, to  widen the habitat for the distribution of the Russian language and for the pres- ervation of the Russian people, by using their common activity, their numbers,  and their quality.”27 Those outside of Russia who subscribe to the idea of a “Russian world”  are more likely to support an economic and cultural partnership with Russia.  The project’s authors called for a “geo-economic direction,” getting the  </page> <page sequence="12"> 8 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies diaspora of Russian-speaking peoples to guarantee Russia’s “inclusion” into  the technological and fi nancial reservoirs of the West. This would strengthen  Russia’s position in the global economy and in the world more generally. As  Petr Shchedrovitskiy wrote: The more world problems that are expressed and, perhaps, solved within the  framework of the Russian language, the more in demand the cultural and human  resources of the Russian world will become. The paradox of today’s situation  is that any country which pretends to the status of world power tries to satisfy  not only the interests of its own citizens, but also tries to work in the interest of  citizens of other states and countries. The greater the number of citizens of other  states who have need of Russia, the more stable is Russia’s position in the world.  The foundation of its stability and necessity informing Russian statehood can  and must be sought within the confi nes of the Russian World, in policies of the  constructive development of its world networks.28 Equally important to the western orientation of the concept was the idea  that there was a “new abroad” for the Russian state to draw on. Writing in 2003,  Sergei Gradiovskiy formulated this idea in the following:  The Russian World, when taken in the geo-cultural framework that we are offer- ing, is directed at the integration of our state with the donor countries for the fl ow  of immigration into Russia (and not with the countries that receive emigrants  from Russia), in other words, with a potential or actual Third World. In this  sense the Russian Geopolitical World that we project is related to post-imperial  formations in Europe, such as the British Commonwealth, the group of Ibero- American states “nourished” by Spain, the society of Francophone states and  other analogous formations.29  This vision of the project as a kind of “white man’s burden” in relation to  former colonies was also present from the beginning, based on two not-entirely  correct suppositions—that the USSR had been an empire, while the new coun- tries (the former Soviet colonies) are like developing countries—that is, the  so-called Third World.   In fact, the modernized Soviet periphery, from the Baltic states to Kazakhstan  and Kyrgyzstan, can in no way be regarded as third world—there is a social and  cultural chasm between them and Afghanistan or the nations of Africa. The  examples, however, of the Francophone world and their experiences are more  useful in the given instance. There was also a discussion about what the borders of the “Russian world”  would be and on the criteria for inclusion; in other words, what made for self- identifi cation with the “Russian world.”  In the opinion of some of the authors of the concept, “the Russian language  cannot and should not be the sole boundary of the Russian Geo-cultural World.”  Spanish-speaking Mexico is offered as an example of a place that is part of more  than one cultural space, because migration fl ows draw it into the cultural space  of the English-speaking United States, as North American “Latinos” encourage  </page> <page sequence="13"> Valery Tishkov | 9 bilingualism, to enable integration. Similarly, they argue, the Russian world  could also attract people who do not speak Russian and who are not Orthodox,  but who maintain other kinds of affi liations to Russia or Russians. The “Russian  world” is not simply a union of a Russian people divided by state boundaries. What makes the whole “Russian world” project interesting is that it has been  set against the realities of the modern world and Russia’s policy priorities. In  fact, the metaphor of the “Russian world” was embodied in a political proj- ect during Vladimir Putin’s presidency, though its realization suffered from the  same dramatic metamorphoses that the “Russian world” itself did. In October 2001, at the First Congress of Foreign Countrymen in Moscow,  President Putin announced the task of consolidating and structuring “a unifi ed  Russian world” to serve as the most important economic, political, and intel- lectual resource of Russia, and proposed making this one of the priorities of  state policy.  However, the very next year, the president’s administration proposed a citi- zenship law adopted by the State Duma30 that eliminated many of the hopes  Russian “foreign countrymen” had had for special connections to and support  from Russia. That law removed all preferences or special circumstances for offer- ing Russian citizenship to foreign citizens of the former USSR and to people  who had kept their old Soviet passports and had not received citizenship in any  of the successor states of the USSR.  The law compounded restrictions that had not long before been introduced  by the law “On the State Policy of the Russian Federation Regarding Foreign  Countrymen.”31 The latter offered an ethnically selective principle for defi n- ing “countrymen,” with the hidden xenophobic principle of giving preference  only to those who “do not have their own state outside of the boundaries of  the Russian Federation” (that is, “countrymen” who are not Jews, Ukrainians,  Armenians, Georgians, and so forth).  Those seeking to propagandize the idea of a “Russian world” fought against  these changes. At that 2001 congress an International Council of Foreign  Countrymen had been established, under the honorary chairmanship of  Moscow mayor Yuri M. Luzhkov. In October 2003, this council organized an  international forum, “The Foreign Diaspora—Russia’s Intellectual Resource,”  in which representatives of 58 countries took part. The participants adopted an  appeal to President Putin in which scientists, cultural activists, social activists,  and educators from the “Russian abroad” announced their readiness to “facili- tate the creation of a positive image for the new Russia” and to work out the  “conceptual underpinnings of a Russian World uniting the Russian diaspora.”  The most important point in this appeal, however, was the request to “con- structively re-work” the two laws mentioned above. The law on citizenship  was eventually amended, but the amendments did not change the unfriendly  inclination of that act in regard to former Russian fellow citizens.32 The forum  also adopted resolutions about the activity of the international council and its  </page> <page sequence="14"> 10 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies regional associations, about supporting education in the Russian language and  for Russian-speaking people, about publishing and TV broadcasting, and even  one about conducting a gathering of pre-revolutionary Russian nobility from  the Russian abroad.33  The Second Congress of Foreign Countrymen took place in 2005, but now  without any euphoria since immigration into Russia from the FSU states had  in effect been closed off. In 2007 new interest in the theme was provoked by a series of circumstances,  fi rst among them the union of the Russian Orthodox Church Overseas with the  Russian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate and the declaration by  the Russian Federation’s president that 2007 was to be the “Year of the Russian  Language.”   In his annual address to the federal assembly in 2007 President Putin once  again turned to the idea of the “Russian world,” saying:  Historically, our country was formed as a union of many peoples and cultures.  The foundation of the spirituality of the Russian people has from time immemo- rial been the idea of a common world, common for people of various nationali- ties and confessions. This year, the Year of the Russian Language, gives reason  once again to remember that Russian is a language of the historical brotherhood  of peoples, a language of true international communication. The language is not  just the repository of an entire layer of truly world-class achievements, but is  also a living space for a multimillion-fold “Russian world,” which, of course,  is signifi cantly wider than Russia itself. Thus, as the common heritage of many  peoples, the Russian language will never become a language of hatred or enmity,  of xenophobia or isolationism.34  President Putin on June 23, 2007 ordered the creation of the “Russian World  Fund” ... “in order to popularize the Russian language as a cultural asset of Russia  and an important element of Russian and world culture, as well as to support  programs teaching Russian language abroad.” The fund was accredited in the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Science. Vyacheslav  A. Nikonov was appointed executive director. The fi rst European Russian forum  was held on October 1–2 in Brussels, with the theme, “Russophone Society in  Europe and its Role in EU–Russian Relations.” This was followed by an inter- national conference organized by the Russian Academy of Sciences on October  22–23 on the theme, “Russian Language in the CIS and Baltic Countries,”35  then by a general gathering of the Academy of Sciences on December 19 that  considered the topic, “Russian Language in the Modern World.”36  Factors and Dynamics of the “Russian World” Any conversation about the Russian world has to begin with the people of  Russia. They created the largest territorial state in the world and are among the  ten most populous states of the world. The Russian state has many exemplary  accomplishments, and its contribution to world civilization and world culture  </page> <page sequence="15"> Valery Tishkov | 11 is more than remarkable. It is not every state and people that is able to give  birth to a phenomenon of global proportions, something that might be called  a “world”—that is, a trans-national and trans-continental community that is  united by its attachments to a single state and by its loyalty to that state’s cul- ture. Along with Russia, such worlds belong only to Spain, France, and China,  and perhaps also Great Britain and Ireland. A “world” or diaspora is not simply the sum of the emigrants who have left  the territory of a historical state in various epochs. That is an approximate but  not precisely identical phenomenon. Obviously, without mass emigration there  can be no appearance of a culturally related population beyond the boundar- ies of the state. Simply by itself, however, a large number of emigrants do not  guarantee the appearance of a related external world. There can be a great many  emigrants, as for example those from India, whose external emigration is the  largest in the world. However, the racial, linguistic, and caste differences at the  moment of departure and their quick assimilation in the case of those from  India has not created a phenomenon that might be termed an “Indian world”  similar to the “Huaqiao world” (of overseas Chinese) or “Russian world” (of  emigrants from Russia). Why is it more correct to say that people from Russia (not just Russian  people) gave birth to the Russian world (not the world of people from Russia),  although the emigration from Russia and those countries which at one time  were part of Russia has as multiethnic a character as do the peoples of Russian  themselves?   One major reason is that ethnicity often loses its particularity in the diaspora.  Emigrants from a particular country are perceived by the receiving society to be a  homogeneous mass (culturally identical). For some time emigrants from Russia  were called and continue to be called Russians, as an adjectival form based on  the name of their country of origin, and nothing more. As a rule, the emigrants  themselves follow this simplifi ed understanding, although there are many situa- tions and reasons by which they might reject “Russianness” and declare that they  are Jews, Gypsies, Chechens, Cherkess, Finno–Ugrics, and so forth. Let us say that for the French or Americans it may be more signifi cant that  someone in their country comes from Russia and speaks Russian than the fact  that he might be a Chuvash or an Ossetin. In the broader world the latter cat- egories are more remote. Emigrants themselves often agree with this, since it is  more diffi cult for them to explain that Russia has Chuvash and Ossetins and  many other various nationalities living within it. This simplifi ed understand- ing of emigrants from other countries is the norm—people in Russia also see  emigrants from China as Chinese, from Spain as Spaniards, and Great Britain  as English. Within Russia the ethnic differences among citizens remains more  signifi cant. “Overseas we are all Russians, but at home we are all different” is  one of the common sentiments of the countrymen, refl ecting a deeply primor- dial understanding of ethnicity. </page> <page sequence="16"> 12 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies The shared Russian language is another reason why the diaspora becomes a  Russian diaspora, and not a simple emigration or gathering of all who have left  the country. Language becomes the primary cultural differentiating characteris- tic by which they recognize and build their unity in the external world.  As a rule, those who have lost that trait lose their allegiance to the Russian  world. Tatars from Lithuania, Cherkess from Jordan, and Adygei from Kosovo  are not a part of the “Russian world.” The Russian Federation law on govern- ment support for “countrymen” does consider them part of the historical group  of “countrymen” from Russia now living abroad, and as such they qualify for  assistance should they opt to resettle in Russia.  Descendants of Russians or Jews who left Russia before or just after the 1917  Revolution and who are now assimilated into the linguistic and social environ- ment of where they live, are also not part of the Russian world in the full sense of  the term, even if the desire to engage in charitable acts, try to reform Russia, and  in some cases more cynically earn some easy money, may have led them to “re- member” their Russianness. We saw a great many examples of this in the begin- ning of the 1990s. One of these descendants, who barely spoke Russian—Boris  Jordan—for a time headed the TV channel NTV, and still has substantial busi- ness interests in Russia. Many of the “returnees” are not just acting out of deeply  practical reasons, but have also created deep emotional and cultural attachments. The “Russian world” also includes those who left the country, regardless of  how long ago, those who preserved their Orthodox faith, their knowledge of  Russian, and also, in varying degrees, loyalty and allegiance to Russia. Russian  Dukhobors in Canada or Lipovans in Romania, both groups who emigrated  from Imperial Russia long ago, remain a part of the “Russian world,” even  though their environment did not make it easy for them to retain their Russian  identity, particularly their connection to the Russian language. Former residents  of the USSR who emigrated to Europe and America in the last two decades who  continue to play the famous TV game KVN (Klub veselykh i nakhodchivykh— The Happy and Clever Club) in Russian are a part of the Russian world, even if  they are not ethnic Russians, but Armenians, Georgians, Ukrainians, and their  native roots are found today not only in Russia, but also in the new indepen- dent states. By formal citizenship and political loyalty they might belong more  to Ukraine, Georgia, or Armenia, but in the linguistic and cultural sense they  preserve a strong orientation toward Russia and Russian culture.  There are also many other details that I have observed in émigré life, among  New Yorkers (especially in Brighton Beach), in San Francisco, and in Los  Angeles (especially in university areas and around IT companies) where those  from the former USSR live. Their personal communications, sources of infor- mation, the books they read, their daily lives, and their interests are to a great  extent processed through the Russian language and revolve around Russia as a  kind of cultural magnet (the most frequent expression is “this is like in Russia”  or “this isn’t like in Russia”). </page> <page sequence="17"> Valery Tishkov | 13 In particular the Russian language and Russian-language Soviet and post- Soviet culture serve as the historical memory that unites people and constitutes  that world. The connection with Russia, in the sense of loyalty and attraction,  remains the most important characteristic of the Russian world, but the con- nection can be mutable and take contradictory meanings and directions. There  is a sense of connection and a demonstrated attitude toward Russia, whether it  is among the descendants of Russian emigrants who have preserved Fort Ross  in California or the battlers against “the Kremlin’s regime” who live as political  emigrants in London. Thus the Russian language, Russian-language culture,  and a demonstrable interest in the Motherland are what create the criteria for  membership in the “Russian world.” Taking the criterion of Russian language, what kinds of numbers are we  speaking of today? According to data from the Summer Linguistic Institute,  Russian is the native language of 147–150 million people, and another 113– 120 million are fl uent in it as a second language. The total of those who know  and use Russian is about 260–280 million people.37  Thus, for example, in Russia and Belarus about 97 percent of the population  can speak Russian; in the Baltics and Ukraine, about 80 percent; in Moldova,  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, and Georgia, about 70 percent. In terms of  the overall number of speakers, Russian is the fi fth most-spoken language in the  world. For a number of historical reasons, the scale of its distribution has not  been growing, but rather shrinking over the past two decades. Between 1991  and 1997 several thousand Russian schools were closed in the new abroad,  while the number of people studying Russian dropped by more than 2 million.  Nevertheless, school instruction in Russian (apart from in Russia, where 97 per- cent of students study it) continues in the majority of the post-Soviet states—75  percent in Belarus; 41 percent in Kazakhstan; 25 percent in Ukraine; 23 per- cent in Kyrgyzstan; 21 percent in Moldova; 7 percent in Azerbaijan; 5 percent  in Georgia; and 2 percent in Armenia. The distributive geography of Russian outside of Russia is extremely broad.  In addition to the new former Soviet states, there are Russian speakers living  in Europe (about 3 million), the United States (about 3 million), and Israel  (750,000). According to the 2000 census in the United States, Russian was the  fi rst domestic language for 706,000 people.38 During the 1990s the Russian- speaking population of the United States nearly tripled. However, not all of  these people are ethnic Russians. What then does Russian ethnicity mean as  a distinguishing characteristic, when the “Russian world” includes about 25  million ethnic Russians in post-Soviet states and a few million others further  abroad? The further back in time one goes, and the greater distance from Russia the  emigrants’ new home is, the less useful ethnicity becomes as the distinguishing  characteristic of the “Russian world.” Russians (also known as Great Russians)  were an obvious minority and remain so in the farther parts of the “Russian  </page> <page sequence="18"> 14 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies world.” Thus, for example, in the United States only 25 percent of Russian  speakers are ethnic Russians. In Europe, two-thirds of the Russian speakers  are Russian Germans, Greeks, Jews, Armenians, Ukrainians, and other non- Russian emigrants from the USSR and the post-Soviet states. For example,  more than a million Russian Germans (known also as Volga Germans), who  are native Russian speakers, moved to Germany from Kazakhstan and Russia  in the 1990s. In European countries, questions of discerning ethnic origin are  even more complex. In Finland there are 33,400 Russian speakers, of whom  5,000 are the descendants of old émigrés who either moved to or remained  in Finland when it was split off from imperial Russia. The rest are post-Soviet  emigrants. Who are they—Russians? Karelians? Belarussians? Most likely these  are primarily Russian people, since Finland abuts Russia’s European north. This  is not the case in all countries, however. In other Scandinavian countries, Great  Britain, France, Poland, and the Czech Republic there are now hundreds, even  thousands of Russian-speaking emigrants from Russia, representing numerous  ethnic communities. There are no reliable statistics on this. Thus, non-Russians  for whom Russian is the native or main language of communication can be  ascribed to the Russian world. But what can we make of people’s individual identifi cation with the Russian  world? Can all Russians and Russian-speaking people be considered part of the  Russian world (if they don’t consider themselves so)? In Latvia or Estonia, some  ethnic Russians joined human chains of people demanding independence, and  in recent years some local Russian supported moving the Monument to the  Soviet Soldier in Tallinn,39 and others were in favor of closing Russian schools  in Riga.  It is a diffi cult question deciding whether or not such people are part of the  “Russian world.” Russian ethnic identifi cation might draw such people to the  Russian world in spite of their political and ideological identities, and their citi- zenship, since they have not been given a fully equal place in Estonian or Latvian  society. To achieve this they have to stop being Russian and become Estonian or  Latvian. However, Russian youths who study Estonian but have not forgotten  Russian can scarcely be considered to be part of the “Russian world” when they  do their national military service as part of NATO’s forces. Certainly they would  never be considered as such by the authors of the “Russia world” project. A well-known Russian philosopher, Alexander Tsipko, noted in his sketch  about Odessa that there was a “tendency to leave the Russian world but to  preserve the Russian language, as the Russian cultural legacy is personal and  collective capital.” Tsipko himself was from Russian Odessa, knew it in the  1960s through the 1980s, and has observed that Odessa today is moving from  the Russian world toward embracing Ukrainian statehood and the West.40 It is  impossible to ignore this new dynamic in the Russian world. If we do, we risk  alienating those whom we consider to be part of the Russian people and whom  we would like to identify with the “Russian world.” Russian ethnicity plays  </page> <page sequence="19"> Valery Tishkov | 15 much the same role for the later (Soviet and post-Soviet) waves of emigration  and for the new diaspora that did not emigrate as Orthodoxy did for earlier  (pre-Soviet) waves of emigration. Even Russian ethnicity may not always be an  indisputable proof of belonging to the Russian world.  For post-Soviet émigrés and for those who did not move anywhere but had  the borders of their own motherland “emigrate” away from them, the dominant  factor in identifi cation with the “Russian world” is language, as well as ethnic  and other lingering ties to Russia. Identifi cation with the “Russian world” is  greatest for those in the former Soviet states who experience discrimination  and/or the diminished status of Russians or of “Russian-speakers” in favor of  the “titular” ethno-nationalities. In these instances religion plays a lesser role,  though one that continues to grow. For all the variety that has been noted, the  situational and mythological quality of the “Russian world” is a reality that  shows itself in a wide variety of instances, most of them signifi cant for Russia  and of value to Russians. The Old Russian World For the past 150 years there has been a substantial emigration from Russia, al- though not all of those who left Russia formed a diaspora. In pre-reform Russia  there was an intensive and widespread colonization and primarily a religious  emigration (of Russian Old Believers). Although the settlers of the eighteenth  through the fi rst half of the nineteenth century almost always remained within  the ever-widening boundaries of Russia, some of them settled in Dobrudzhe,  which was incorporated into Romania and Bulgaria in 1878, and in Bukovina,  which in 1774 became part of Austria. Even earlier, in the 1770s and 1780s, more  than 200,000 Crimean Tatars moved into Ottoman territory. In the beginning  of the nineteenth century there were 275,000 Tatars and Nogai who lived in the  European part of Turkey (Rumelii).41 In 1771 about 200,000 Kalmyks moved to  Djungaria (Kalmyks offer an example of multiple diaspora identities—for many  of them their homeland is the country they left, and even several countries at  once, depending on the situation and on the individual or group choices).42  The migration of populations increased signifi cantly during the reforms of  the mid-nineteenth century. More than 500,000 people left Russia between  the 1860s and the 1880s, mostly Poles, Jews, and Germans going to neighbor- ing European states and a smaller number going to countries in the Americas.  What was notable about this wave of emigration was that it did not lead to the  formation of a lasting Russian diaspora. The reason in this case was that many  of those leaving had been a diaspora in Russia and were thus moving to what  they viewed as their true historical motherland (Poland, Germany, or Israel  [Palestine]). This made it impossible for them to hold a lingering identifi cation  with Russia. The descendants of these fi rst emigrants from the Russian Empire  whom I have interviewed live in many countries of the world, but they identify  </page> <page sequence="20"> 16 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies with Poland, Israel, and now, with the Baltic countries, Ukraine, or Belorussia,  and have no sense of being in diaspora.  In addition, for a large number of those leaving Russia at that time, this emi- gration was not ideological, but rather one wholly based on economic survival.  The number of intellectual elites and ethnic activists among them was not suf- fi cient to instill in the emigrants a sense of being part of a diaspora. Without in- tellectuals as producers of subjective ideas there is no diaspora; there is simply a  migrant population. It may be that the antimonarchical sentiments of the early  Russian migrations also played a contributing role, but this question requires  further study. Most likely, such sentiments were of secondary importance to  what was largely an illiterate population drawn into resettlement. In the last two decades of the nineteenth century there was a sharp increase  in emigration from Russia. About 1.1 million people left, mostly for the United  States and Canada but other destinations as well. One unusual group was the  “mukhazhiry,” people who lived primarily in the western part of the North  Caucasus and who left during the war in the Caucasus. They resettled in various  parts of the Ottoman Empire, primarily in the Middle East. Today the descen- dants of these emigrants, according to various sources, number about 3 million  people in Turkey alone.43 These people were the foundation of the Cherkess di- aspora,44 which formed before their territory in the northern Caucasus became  part of Russia. The activity of the Cherkess diaspora in the several countries in  which it exists—including associations, political groups, printing houses, and  kinsmen networks—has always been focused on preserving their language and  culture, without positive reference to Russia.45  The contributions of the donor nation (in this case Russia) to preserving the  diaspora after the initial ejection of the population were minimal. It was not  possible to write about the mukhazhiry in Soviet times, let alone have contact  with them. The motherland disappeared from the ideological complex of the di- aspora for a long time for many and, for some, forever. The Caucasus was some- where over there, beyond the iron curtain, and provided scant nourishment for  the diaspora other than a mission for some individuals to fi ght the USSR and  communism. For example, Abdurakhman Avtorkhanov,46 a Chechen political  scientist and popular writer who lived in West Germany, held a concept of the  motherland so vague that his history of the deportation of the Chechens and  Ingush was based on the conviction that the Vainakh47 disappeared in the geno- cidal furnace of Stalinist repression.  Bereft of any connection to its motherland, the Cherkess diaspora had virtu- ally disappeared as such—its population generally assimilating into host coun- try—only to be reawakened by the situation in the USSR and then Russia.  Those living outside of Russia were sometimes faster to become politicized by  the changing environment than those still living in their ancestral lands, and  those in the diaspora were able to help devise a whole range of new collective  and group strategies.  </page> <page sequence="21"> Valery Tishkov | 17 The presence of fellow countrymen (or tribesmen) abroad helped the former  Soviet people to master the outside world that had suddenly opened before  them. The diaspora also became a source for facilitating new forms of activity  such as entrepreneurship. Members of the “rich diaspora” might help set up  businesses or at least help organize shopping tours in Turkey, Jordan, the United  States, and other countries. Finally there was the hope (mostly in vain) that  large numbers of emigrants and their descendants would return to their histori- cal homelands, creating a favorable demographic balance that would strengthen  the hand of titular nationalities48 that wanted to form “national” governments  during the “parade of sovereignties.”49 The Abkhaz were the fi rst to try to add foreign fellow countrymen to bolster  their numbers. The Kazakhs, the Chechens, and the Cherkess (Adygeis) then  followed. For example, the war in the former Yugoslavia made appealing the  image of Russia’s Adygei region50 as a homeland for the Adygeis who felt unable  to remain in Kosovo or emigrate to more attractive countries. The Republic  of Adygei adopted a special law on the repatriation of Adygeis that resulted  in the resettling of only twenty families from Kosovo. This example suggests  that historically remote migrations with physical and cultural isolation from  the motherland rarely create lasting diasporas despite the efforts of those in the  motherland.  A similar situation might have occurred with the primarily eastern Slavic  emigration from Russia at the end of the nineteenth century, had it not received  a powerful replenishment later. In the fi rst two decades of the twentieth cen- tury, emigration from Russia increased—before World War I about 2.5 million  people left Russia, settling primarily in countries in the New World. During the  approximately 100 years from the beginning of mass external migration up to  1917, about 4.5 million people left the Russian Empire. Can all these emigrants  (or, more precisely, their descendants) from pre-revolutionary Russia be consid- ered a diaspora or part of the Russian world? My answer is, of course not. First, in terms of territory the majority of emigrants from the Russian empire  during that period left from Poland, Finland, Lithuania, western Belarus, and  western Ukraine (Volynia). Thus to a signifi cant degree Russia laid down the ma- terial for the diasporas from other countries, which gained i nternational recogni- tion only later. Although many of the emigrants were comfortable with Russian  culture and even considered Russian their native tongue, one could scarcely  consider, for example, Adolf Hitler’s comrade-in-arms Alfred Rosenberg—who  came from Lithuania and who spoke Russian better than he did German—to  be a representative of the Russian emigration. That said, political speculation by  historians does permit constructions of that sort. American historian Michael  Kellogg claims that Hitler’s supporters from the Baltic republics and from anti- Bolshevik emigrés served as “Russian roots of Nazism” in Germany. 51  The ethnic composition of this emigration also infl uenced its ability to be- come a Russian diaspora. Of the 3.3 million pre-revolutionary emigrants from  </page> <page sequence="22"> 18 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies Russia to the United States, 41.5 percent were Jewish. Of the 1.6 million emi- grants in the fi rst decade of the twentieth century, 44 percent were Jewish,  27 percent were Polish, 9 percent were Lithuanians, 8 percent were Finns, 6  percent were Germans, and 5 percent were Russian.52 Pogroms and campaigns  of discrimination against Jews in Russia, as well as poverty, conditioned among  them a deep and long abiding negative image of the motherland, some of which  persists today. The successful integration of these emigrants into American so- ciety (not without problems and discrimination well through the middle of the  twentieth century) helped promote the forgetting of “Russianness,” imputing  either as a territory or as an ethnic community. The many descendants of this  emigration whom I have met in the United States, Canada, and Mexico (several  dozen of them among my colleagues and fellow social scientists alone!) have  almost entirely failed to preserve or feel ties to Russia. That means they are not  part of a diaspora. This holds true as well for Poles, Finns, Lithuanians, and  Germans. Of the 4.5 million emigrants from pre-Revolutionary Russia, only about  500,000 were considered “ethnic Russians,” but these also included Ukrainians,  Belarusians, and some Jews. The 1920 U.S. Census counted 392,000 “Russians”  and 56,000 “Ukrainians,” but these are clearly exaggerated fi gures since among  them were people from other ethnic groups, particularly Jews. The article on  “Russians” in the Harvard Encyclopedia of Ethnic Groups warns that in the cen- suses of 1910, 1920, and 1930 that category included not just Great Russians,  Ukrainians, and Belarussians, but also Russian Jews, Latvians, Lithuanians,  Estonians, and Carpathian Rus from Gallicia, who considered Russian their   native tongue.53 The Canadian census of 1921 similarly counted almost  100,000 “Russians,” although this category included almost all eastern Slavs  and Jews who had come from Russia. And what percentage of the descendants  of these as many as 500,000 Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians feel a per- sonal connection to Russia is diffi cult to say exactly, but it likely constitutes a  very small fraction. Traditional Diaspora and Diffi cult Circumstances The history of the contemporary Russian diaspora more rightly begins with  the migrations after 1917. During the period 1918–1922 there was a politi- cal emigration of those who did not accept Soviet power or had lost the civil  war, the so-called “White Emigration” of about 1.5 to 2 million people, the  overwhelming majority of whom were ethnic Russians. They were not only the  constituents of a diaspora, but lived as a diaspora, seeking to preserve Russian  language and culture and oftentimes the Orthodox faith. This migration led to  the birth of the “Russian world.” The “White Emigration” shows that while migration is primarily socio-eco- nomic in nature, there generally exists a political dimension to diaspora formation.  </page> <page sequence="23"> Valery Tishkov | 19 There were many from the elite among these emigrants, and they felt a greater  sense of loss for their motherland (and their property). This was in contrast to the  laboring emigrants “in rough-cut sheepskin coats” (as earlier Slavic immigrants to  Canada were sometimes termed). The “White Emigration” produced a parallel  cultural stream, which now has partially been returned to Russia.  In the past two decades the descendants of this wave of emigration have shown  the most sympathy for and political interest in Russia. Even greater than the nos- talgia of those in the diaspora is what some in Russia seek to make of it, defi ning  the culture of the diaspora as a lost norm and its language as “pure” Russian. The  Russian (ethnic or national) diaspora has been reborn, rich with the attention  and apologetic generosity of contemporaries in the historical homeland. Before  our very eyes historians have constructed a myth about the “Golden Age” of the  Russian emigration, which may be at odds with its actual history. The White Emigration continued to bolster its ranks with new members.  During World War II there were almost 9 million prisoners and forced laborers,  of whom only about 5.5 million returned to the USSR. Many were killed or  died of their wounds or of disease. At least 300,000 so-called displaced persons  (DPs) remained in Europe or moved to the United States or other countries.  This group shared cultural and political values with the White Emigration, al- lowing a merging of these two streams, as both were interested in preserving the  use of the Russian language and were willing to have only minimal contact with  the motherland maintained even into the Khrushchev years.54  My American informant Semyen Klimson was taken from Belarus as a young  man by the Germans and then remained in the west after the war. He married  Valentina, the daughter of a White emigrant (a relative of General Krasnov55  and the theosophist Madame Blavatskaya56). During our last meeting at their  home in Virginia in the summer of 1998, Valentina Vladimirovna [Klimson]  confessed that her French education (she grew up in France) made her feel more  like a Frenchwoman, but she remains Russian and keeps up the language “just  for Semyen, who stayed Russian.” The small but politically vocal emigration from the USSR to Israel, the  United States, Germany, and Greece in the 1960–1980s was even more ide- ological. From 1951 to 1991 about 1.8 million people left the country (the  most was in 1990–1991, about 400,000), of whom nearly 1 million were Jews  (two-thirds went to Israel and one-third to the United States), 550,000 were  Germans, and about 100,000 each were Armenians and Greeks. The emigra- tion continued in subsequent years, but at a somewhat reduced rate. The most  recent wave of emigration from Russia to the West has been the most mosaic  of the diasporas, varied both in reasons for emigrating and in conglomerate  identity. Tourist visits, study at foreign universities, and temporary residence  (including for the privileged in their own homes in London or Paris) replaces  the need for emigration in many cases.  </page> <page sequence="24"> 20 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies Diaspora, Identity, and Ethnic Agglomerations People leaving Russia have formed the Russian national diaspora and also cre- ated basic ethnic agglomerations in two countries (the United States and Israel)  that form the these countries’ core populations. Jewish migration has always  been a signifi cant part of the exodus from Russia, but at the end of the twenti- eth century Jews formed the majority of all who left the USSR and the Russian  Federation. Formally the Jews and Germans from Russia were reuniting with  or returning to their historical homelands, but in essence this was an exodus of  people who were culturally Russian. They left for various reasons—economic,  ideological, professional, and personal. Jewish émigrés from previous waves had  generally adapted successfully to their new societies, many of them losing the  Russian language and any emotional connection to Russia. The descendants of  the fourth prime minister of Israel, Odessa-born Golda Meir,57 could hardly be  numbered among the representatives of the “Russian world,” the same as the  scores of American professors of Russian–Jewish origin whose grandparents had  emigrated from Russia. Not all Jews “returned” or “rejoined” their “historic homeland, however, and  not all Jews rejected Russia. With perestroika58 and the opening up of the USSR,  people who left the country were not forced to reject it. One can learn Hebrew  without forgetting Russian, and it is no longer necessary to break off contact with  friends and relatives in Russia. The ubiquity of Russian-language culture, print  media, and TV in Israel is second only to Hebrew and far exceeds Arabic.59  The recent Jewish emigrants from Russia to the United States were more  quickly acculturated than their Israeli counterparts. This part of world Jewry  might also be conditionally ascribed to the Russian world, especially if this  affi liation is not understood as exclusive. Today, it is possible for people to si- multaneously participate in several cultures and to consider themselves part of  several cultural–civilization communities.  Many of the Germans who moved from Russia and Kazakhstan to Germany  over the past 20 years also have ties to the “Russian world.” The local Germans  consider them to be Russians, as many do themselves. Perhaps only their chil- dren, once they have learned how to speak German without an accent and have  forgotten Russian, will cease to link themselves to Russia and will thus leave the  “Russian world.” Such situations highlight how the “Russian world” is not just  a statistical group of people who have migrated from Russia. Rather, it is a form  of cultural behavior and identity. If one were to exclude from the total number of historical emigrants from  Russia and their descendants all those who are completely assimilated and can- not speak Russian—all those who consider themselves to be French, Argentine,  Mexican, or Jordanian and have no sense of connection to Russia—even so  the number of “overseas countrymen” would remain large and diffi cult to de- fi ne through “objective” traits. Membership in a diaspora depends upon self- identity and refl ects emotional choice.  </page> <page sequence="25"> Valery Tishkov | 21  Here is a personal example. I was acquainted with the late George Ignatieff,60  the famous Canadian diplomat and rector of Trinity College at the University of  Toronto. He not only considered himself Canadian but, precisely, a “Russian– Canadian” (which was what Nikita Khrushchev had taken him to be when they  met at the UN and when Ignatieff went to the USSR in 1955 as part of the  offi cial Canadian delegation). There is no question that Count Ignatieff should  be considered to be part of the Russian diaspora. Almost 20 years later I met his son, Michael Ignatieff,61 a well known jour- nalist and writer, who did not know a single word of Russian, and considered  himself part of the Canadian diaspora in England, stating that, “For me, being  a Canadian,” he said, “is simply one of those privileges that I received as a birth- right.” To categorize the younger Ignatieff as a member of the Russian diaspora  would have been an obvious usurpation of his right to choose how to live his  own life. In 1987 he wrote a marvelous book called The Russian Album,62 about  his journey to a childhood to which he could no longer return and his connec- tions to family heirlooms.  For a reader in Russia the book is a historical and cultural document cre- ated by a member of the Russian diaspora despite the fact that Michael himself  would not grant this. However, during a meeting with him in his bohemian  apartment in old London in January 1997, he did not look like a representa- tive of the Russian diaspora, unlike his father, whom I had seen in Toronto.  However, Michael wrote the following curious words about him: “At the same  time he always kept himself apart from the Russian emigration, with its frac- tional intrigues and antediluvian politics. When I was a child he always seemed  more Canadian than Russian to me. Even today he remains a more patriotic  and sentimental Canadian than I am myself. For him Canada was the country  that gave him a new life.”63 In London Michael told me that he was fi rst of all  an Englishman because his mother was English. However, in 2006, when he  decided to run for prime minister of Canada as a Liberal Party candidate, he  emphasized his “Canadianness” as his sole and unquestioned identity. Which of  the two Ignatieffs was part of the diaspora, and which of them belonged to the  “Russian world?” There is no clear answer. Identity drift of an individual or a  group can be situational and, in any event, dynamic. A great deal depends upon  instrumental (or personal) calculations and also on the economic and political  infl uences of the country of exodus and that of emigration. The Far Russian World of Today The collapse of the USSR did not result in a mass emigration from Russia to  more developed countries in the West. Nonetheless, the post-1991 exodus was  large enough, especially in the fi rst half of the 1990s. According to Russian  fi gures, for the entire period from 1989 to 1999, 1.046 million people left  Russia and the “near-abroad”64 countries, with 97 percent of that migration  to the United States, Canada, Israel, Germany, and Finland.65 This part of the  </page> <page sequence="26"> 22 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies emigration also includes the fairly numerous Russian groups that were formed  by emigrants from Russia and other post-Soviet states to Central Europe (espe- cially to the Czech Republic and Poland). In all respects, Russians in America are the most powerful and notable  Russian diaspora or part of the “Russian world” as well the most signifi cant  for Russia. Russian Americans (Russian-speaking emigrants from the former  USSR) constitute slightly over 10 percent of the total foreign-born population  in the United States with an average age of 32.5 years—a young and dynamic  part of the overall population. Their main areas of concentration are the New  York Tri-State area (24 percent), California (16 percent), Illinois (16 percent),  Pennsylvania (10 percent), Massachusetts (8 percent), and Florida (7 percent).  The average income of Russian Americans is $50,000 per year; 53 percent have  BA degrees or higher; 57 percent own their own home (as compared to 41  percent of the total foreign-born population); 67.5 percent work in managerial,  technical, professional, and other high-qualifi cation jobs (as compared to 45  percent of the total foreign-born population). The number of large businesses  owned by Russian Americans is increasing: some 300 businesses and other en- terprises in Denver and 700 in the San Francisco region.66  In 1999–2000 Galina Komarova of the Institute of Ethnology and  Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences conducted a study of the  Russian residents of the greater Boston area—about 20,000 people in 2000.  One of her conclusions was that the Russian-speaking community in this urban  conglomerate is sustaining itself by creating niche labor jobs and communica- tions due to its continued use of the Russian language.67  The situation of the modern Russian-language diaspora in the far abroad  (primarily Europe and North America) differs from that of its predecessors in  terms of its attitude toward both language and politics. Russian remains the  domestic language for several million emigrants from the former Soviet Union,  who now live—and the majority of whom will continue to live—in the West.  Russian is also used at work by those who have business or professional inter- ests in Russia or who are in groups in which there is a high concentration of  Russian speakers. Thus, for example, in the Washington offi ce of the Carnegie  Endowment for International Peace’s Russia and Eurasia Program, directed by  former U.S. Ambassador to Russia James F. Collins, at least half of the staff are  either fully bilingual or are native speakers of Russian.  Ethnicity, language, citizenship, and professional interests frequently form  a complex conglomerate (“conglomerate identity”). An example of this is  Carnegie staff assistant Diora Ziyaeva, an Uzbek national from Tashkent and  member of a professorial family. Her father is an Uzbek and grandmother is a  descendant of Armenians from Turkey. Ziyaeva is fully bilingual in Uzbek and  Russian. She graduated from a high school whose primary language of instruc- tion was Russian but took courses in Uzbek while at the University of World  Economy and Diplomacy. In 1999 she was part of a high school exchange that  brought her to the United States, where she learned her fl uent English.  </page> <page sequence="27"> Valery Tishkov | 23 When asked about Russian and the Russian-speaking community in America,  Ziyaeva said, “People watch Russian TV here as much as they do American TV.  Russian movies are also popular—the fi lms of Balabanov,68 Mikhalkov,69 and  some others. People are aware of Russian literature, but people today generally  read less. We watch the news in Russian or get it from the Internet.  The end of the Cold War and Russia’s new face have uncoupled the Russian  language and Russian culture from many negative connotations and emotions,  although this process is being decidedly slowed by certain aspects of contem- porary Russian politics and the continued view in Western society that Russia  is the main enemy of democracy and stability. For all its contradictions and the  mutability of the political situation, the “Russian world” of the far abroad will  not be reduced, in contrast to that of the near abroad, which will be discussed  below. Democratic guarantees for ethno-cultural diversity and the high social  and cultural status of the bearers of Russian-language culture will preserve the  “Russian world” in Western countries.  Post-Soviet Diasporas in the Russian World What happened to the “new Russian world” that appeared after 1991? The col- lapse of the USSR gave the non-titular peoples (mostly Russians and Russian  speakers) three possible life strategy choices—assimilation into the titular lan- guage and culture; emigration to Russia; and fi ghting for equal status in their  new societies. The majority of specialists and professionals only looked at the  fi rst two possibilities—the most unnatural from the viewpoint of rational hu- man choices and the most diffi cult to realize. My position remains as it was in the beginning of the 1990s. I favor parity of  status and a two-community state in a number of the newly independent states,  as well as the guarantee of cultural and linguistic rights for national minorities  (including fellow countrymen from Russia) in those states where status parity  is practically impossible. At the same time, I separate the question of the non- titular population or national minorities and the question of the status of the  Russian language, as a signifi cant portion of the titular population as well as  many ethnic minorities often are also native speakers of Russian. The events of the past fi fteen years have substantially changed the position of  Russians and the status of the Russian language in the post-Soviet states, and as  a result I have modifi ed my position somewhat. Until quite recently it seemed  to me that the assimilation of Russians in the new states would be impossible  in the presence of a Russian ethnic nucleus next door to Russia, especially given  the global status of Russian as a language of modernization and one that con- tributed to the professional successes of many former Soviet citizens. I have now  come to realize that the assimilation of Russians, including linguistic assimila- tion, is possible, albeit it is still not widespread. However, the main cultural  process after the formation of the new states has been the de-Russifi cation of  the titular nationality, including the move from Russian to (titular) national  </page> <page sequence="28"> 24 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies or state languages. This is a linguistic “desiccation” of the Russian world. Will  the post-Soviet states repeat the pattern of what happened when England and  France left their colonies, and the Anglophone and Francophone worlds were  preserved? Or will there be a variant of the post-imperial situation in the former  Austro–Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire, when neither German,  Hungarian, nor Turkish became anything like a lingua franca, while the new  national cultures left almost nothing in their cultural baggage from the previous  imperial states?  In the instance of the far abroad and their old worlds, I use the term “new  Russian world” not for a geographic space, but rather for an imagined (con- structed) socio-cultural community that is made up of not just Russians.  Representatives of other ethnic groups can be ascribed to the Russian world  by language and by a demonstrable connection to Russia, its language, and  its culture. The “Russian world” in the near abroad includes not only the  Russian Dukhobors who live in the Bogdanovsk region of Georgia, but also the  Karabakh Armenians who do not speak Armenian. The Russian world includes  a signifi cant part of the Russian-speaking Belarussians, Ukrainians, Kazakhs,  Uzbeks, Orthodox and Russian-speaking Gagauz in Moldova, Russian-speaking  Tatars in Lithuania, “Siberian” Latvians, Central Asian Koreans, and some other  Table 1.

However, the demographic and socio-cultural foundation of the new  Russian world (of the near abroad) is composed of ethnic Russians—in fact, to  a much greater degree than is true in the Russian world of the far abroad, where  everyone who speaks Russian is considered Russian. Let’s look at the demographic foundation of the Russian world, the numbers  of ethnic Russians who live in the CIS and Baltic countries, as compared to the  Soviet census of 1989 (table 1). The changes over the past thirteen years tell a  great deal.  We can see that the overall number of Russians in the Russian world of the  near abroad after 1989 was reduced by almost 7.5 million people (29.4 per- cent), although about 2.5–3.5 million of them moved to Russia and about 0.5  million emigrated to the far abroad.71  Where did this approximately 3.5 million people disappear to? Most of them  are from Ukraine (from which about 0.5 million people moved to Russia while  the number of Russians there was reduced by 3 million) and Kazakhstan (from  which about 1 million left, while the number of Russians dropped by 2 mil- lion). If the census data is interpreted simply as data about the mechanistic  movements of population (birth, death, migration), then in Ukraine in the  1990s there was something like a “terrible famine” of Russians in which no  fewer than 2.5 million disappeared, since of the 3 million that vanished, only  0.5 million can be ascribed to a natural drop in population, which was about  the same among Russians as it was among Ukrainians. However, that is not the case. No one starved to death in Ukraine in the  1990s. The reduction in the number of Russians took place fi rst as a result of a  change of identity on the part of some citizens from Russian to Ukrainian (pri- marily people of mixed heritage or from mixed families). This was not assimila- tion in its classic form, since those who registered as Ukrainians considered this  identity to be a more comfortable and politically benefi cial state in independent  Ukraine, but they did not lose their knowledge of Russian, and they remained  people of double or mixed identity. There was an analogous census shift in  the Ukraine between the censuses of 1926 and 1937, save that it went from  Ukrainians to Russians, thus complicating the problem of fi guring out how  many Ukrainians died during the period of collectivization72 and famine in the  1930s.73 The explanation in Kazakhstan is a different one, for it is much harder for a  Russian to register as a Kazakh for a whole host of reasons—ethno-linguistic, re- ligious, and even phenotype differences are often too great. However, the 1999  census took place in Kazakhstan during a time of heated nationalism and the  expectation that Kazakhs would prove to be the decisive ethnic majority there.  According to informants, the census was conducted with little enthusiasm by  the census-takers among the population of the country’s big cities, which led  to an underestimate primarily of the Russian population, which is more urban  than the Kazakhs. However, the massive emigration of Russians has already  </page> <page sequence="30"> 26 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies stopped, in part due to generally positive economic conditions. Those Russians  who remain are trying to solidify their rights and their status, even though the  greatest irony is that Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbaev uses Russian in  most of his most important public addresses. In Kazakhstan, as in a few other  post-Soviet states, Russian has gained the ill-defi ned status as the “language of  international communication.”  Russian Language and the Russian-Speaking  Population of the CIS and Baltic States In the USSR Russian was the language of the state and party bureaucracies,  of education, the press, the army, science, and high culture. Even more im- portant, it was the language for communication between peoples of various  nationalities. It was the native language (in the sense of primary language for  knowledge and communication or as the fi rst language learned in childhood)  not just for ethnic Russians, but also for tens of millions of non-Russians. In  the last Soviet census (1989) just before the collapse of the USSR, about 19  million people of other nationalities in addition to Russians named Russian as  their native language, while 69 million people indicated that they were fl uent  in Russian as a second language. In fact, the Soviet censuses under-reported the  number of non-ethnic Russians who spoke Russian as a native language, as the  question of native language required no explanation of the degree of linguistic  competence. Many people claimed their native language to be the language of  their nationality, even if they were not fl uent in that language. Thus millions  of Russian-speaking Soviet people claimed Belarusian, Ukrainian, Moldovan,  Kyrgyz, and other languages to be their native language, even if they did not use  or even know the language.  I did fi eld work in Ust–Ordynsk Autonomous Okrug in Irkutsk oblast in  1989 (soon after the census was taken), where I asked local Russian-speaking  Buryats (Mongols) what language they had indicated on the census as their na- tive tongue. Almost all responded that they had chosen “Buryat,” even if they  were unable to speak a word of Buryat. “If you put down Buryat as your nation- ality, it somehow doesn’t seem right to call Russian your native language,” was  what I was commonly told. It is possible to suppose that if the real fi gures for the distribution and use  of Russian by those who lived in the union republics were known, it would  have been much more diffi cult to put into place such wide-ranging restrictions  against the use of Russian in public life and in offi cial documents that were  introduced in a number of countries. About half of the populations of Ukraine,  Latvia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic,74 and a third of the population of  Moldova, Estonia, and Georgia (if you include Abkhazia and South Ossetia)  were deprived of the right for their language to have offi cial status. With the  aim of distancing themselves from Russia and to push Russian speakers away  </page> <page sequence="31"> Valery Tishkov | 27 from power and other resources, these states put this usurpation of linguistic  rights into effect with international support. Following the collapse of the USSR, for the fi rst time in history large num- bers of Russians and other Russian speakers found themselves becoming stateless  peoples, even though most were living where they had always lived and some  were even living where they had been born. In Latvia close to half the popula- tion fell into this category; and in the capital Riga a majority—and a third of the  population in Estonia. The primary goal of this policy of exclusion—to cause the  migration of Russians back to Russia—has not been achieved. The overwhelming  majority of Russians stayed in the Baltic countries and many are going through a  process of integration into new state communities and national cultures (Latvian  and Estonian). They are unique in the “Russian world,” as they must battle to  achieve equal status and to preserve their cultural identity in the face of the most  powerful and thorough attempt at assimilation that Russians have ever faced.  The situation varies from country to country in the Commonwealth of  Independent States (CIS), but it is nowhere of benefi t to Russians or Russian  speakers, even though Russian is the offi cial language of the CIS and Russia has  tried in every possible way to infl uence the language policy of the CIS member  states, doing what it could to support the Russian-language cultural and infor- mation space. In the USSR in 1989 about 20 million people did not speak Russian, mostly  people living in Central Asia and Azerbaijan. Eighteen years later there has been  a sharp drop in the number of people who know Russian in this region, as well  as the prevalence of the language’s use (Table 2). It is clear that Russian maintains a powerful presence despite its reduced  status, as Russian is effectively a state language only in Belarus and an offi cial  language only in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan (in the latter, the departure of  President Askar Akaev meant that status was essentially revoked). In Belarus  97 percent of the population speaks or can speak Russian; in the Baltic coun- tries and Ukraine around 80 percent can do so; and in Moldova, Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, and Armenia around 70 percent can speak Russian. The  total number of those who consider Russian to be their native language is  26.4 million, 63.6 million are fl uent, and 37.7 million claim a less-than-fl u- ent knowledge of the language. This is nearly half the 1989 fi gure. As indi- cated above, many of those who do not speak Russian live in Central Asia and  Kazakhstan, but their numbers have increased in Georgia and in Ukraine as  well. In these two countries it may be that people did not wish to show that they  know Russian for political reasons. Yet the linguistic situation can change rather  quickly, and in the course of a generation a people can gain or lose one lan- guage or another. When I visited Tbilisi in 2000, my Georgian colleague, the  ethnographer Liya Milikishvili, told me that her children already had trouble  with Russian and that her colleagues would undertake collaborative projects on  Georgian ethnography only if their texts could be done in Georgian.  </page> <page sequence="32"> 28 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies There has been a huge and rapid drop in education in Russian and in the  teaching of the Russian language, and a sharp reduction of the Russian-lan- guage information space. In the 1990s alone about 20,000 Russian schools were  closed in the new abroad, and the number of students who studied in Russian  was reduced by more than 2 million. The tempo has slowed somewhat in re- cent years. Today, apart from Russia (where 97 percent of the students study in  Russian), school instruction continues in Russian in the majority of the post- Soviet states—in Belarus 75 percent; in Kazakhstan 41 percent; in Ukraine 25  percent; in Kyrgyzstan 23 percent; in Moldova 21 percent; in Azerbaijan seven  percent; in Georgia fi ve percent; and in Armenia two percent.75  A very informative study on Russian-language usage was done in October  2007, by Eurasian Monitoring and Nasledie Evrazii, using the polling ser- vice Tsirkon and their local partners.76 The study has data for 12 countries  (Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were not included), with 15,000 respondents  (1,000-2,000 people per country). One of the important indicators of the presence of the language in a society  and its real status is data on the language used at home. Figure 1 shows that in  about half the countries (Latvia, Armenia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, and  also Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) Russian has in fact ceased to be a language  that people use at home.

It is hard for me to believe that Georgian  families use Russian only one-fi fth or one-sixth as often as in Azerbaijan or  Takijistan. It is possible that this refl ects the political preference of respondents  to not admit any cultural ties to what many there see as Georgia’s chief interna- tional protagonist.  On the other hand, in Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine, the majority, or at  least half, of the population speaks Russian as a primary or secondary language  at home, while a minority speaks only in the titular language. In Moldova,  Estonia, Kyrgyzstan, and Latvia, from 20 percent to 40 percent of the popula- tion speak Russian at home.  FIGURE 1.

Russian is almost never used when speaking with  friends and acquaintances outside of work in the Caucasus, Lithuania, and  Tajikistan. Again, it is diffi cult to believe that only one percent of the popula- tion of Georgia uses Russian for communication outside of the home—it is  enough simply to be on the streets and in public places in Tbilisi and to hear  people there to see that this is not the case. On the whole, the picture presented  by this data is accurate, as there is a high degree of Russian language usage in  about half of the CIS and in the Baltic countries. In Ukraine, Russian usage is  virtually the same as Ukrainian usage, while in Belarus the entire population  uses Russian outside the home. </page> <page sequence="34"> 30 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies FIGURE 2.

People claim to read the Russian press or Russian books at  about the same level of frequency as they use Russian in speaking at home and  at work, and Russian-language television is the unconditional leader among  their sources of information. This data suggests that the Russian language is increasingly beginning to be  connected not to the colonial past but to an opportunity for modernization.  The anti-Russian component of post-Soviet nationalisms has noticeably weak- ened, but it has far from disappeared; however, it continues to serve as one of  the primary components of ideology and socio-political practices in the new  national societies. But what is the language situation within the ethnic Russian population in  the newly independent states? According to data78 about the degree of fl uency in  the state language among Russians living outside of Russia (fi gure 6), Russian- speaking residents are learning titular languages, albeit oftentimes slowly and  less frequently in countries where there is a different religion and languages that  share nothing in common with Russian (Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan).79  </page> <page sequence="36"> 32 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies A higher percent of Russians have learned Armenian than any other national  language, because there are so few Russians in Armenia and they have no other  choice in order to live there. It is not surprising that more than 70 percent of  Russians are fl uent in Belarusian and Ukrainian because of the closeness of  these East Slavic languages. In the Baltic countries Russians are learning the  national languages most rapidly and without loss of Russian.  FIGURE 5.

In countries where Russians are able to do so, they  are less interested in learning the national language. The data on languages that the children and grandchildren of the Russians  are using in their studies is also illuminating (fi gure 8). The children and  grandchildren of half of the ethnic Russians in Ukraine are being educated in  Ukrainian, and education patterns in the Baltic countries suggest that within  the next ten or fi fteen years there will be little or no Russian language instruc- tion. Mass linguistic assimilation of Russians or at least a signifi cant bilingual- ism may become the reality of the new Russian world. Today no one in Great Britain can dictate the norms of the English language for  the United States or Canada, where linguistic peculiarities specifi c to each country  have emerged in the English spoken there. There are variants of Spanish in the  Latin American countries, and there is a separate French  language in Canada.  FIGURE 7. What Language Do You Use at Work, in Your Studies?

As Ukrainian philologist  Y. V. Dorofeyev has written, the Russian language has two possible futures in  Ukraine, one as a dialect of Ukrainian and the other as a national variant of  Russian:  The fi rst is unlikely, though it can not be excluded entirely. The second possibility  for the development of Russian is independent development as a result of which  it becomes the Ukrainian variant of Russian. This possibility is more likely and  more promising, so we consider it necessary to direct the attention of linguists  to those tendencies which even today speak of the possibility of the formation of  national variations of Russian in the future.80 In Lithuania the infl uence of the Lithuanian language on Russian is already  noticeable, creating a national variant of Russian. V. Y. Mikhalchenko, of the  Language Institute of the Academy of Sciences, writes of Lithuania:  Some language communities, such for example as the Russians, have lost the  help of language normalizers, since there are no institutions or people who argue  against the use of local borrowings or their modifi cation to fi t Russian linguistic  norms. In connection with this there is a danger of the loss of a given linguistic  community of the Russian literary language and its replacement by another form  of the language, local popular variants of Russian.81 These kinds of variations are to be expected because of the way that linguistic  laws work, as “in the modern world national variants of languages form not  because two groups who speak one language live far apart from one another,  but because of the intensive communication of various ethnic groups, and even  more so from the entire aggregated conditions of the independent lives of na- tional and state societies of people who initially spoke one language.”82  Unlike the hierarchical relations between the literary language and a dialect,  all of the national variants of a language must in theory have equal status, al- though the original Russian language will be acknowledged and continue to  exist. This seems certain to create diffi culties. For example, in Great Britain  the opinion still exists that national variants of English are “spoiled” languages,  while the French call the French spoken in Canada by the dismissive name  “joualle” (hick). In Russia, scientifi c and political circles, including linguists,  stick strictly to the linguistic norm of using “na Ukraine,” 83 not wishing to  recognize the parallel norm of “v Ukraine.” Russian linguists also demonstrate  their rigidity with regard to other new usages of Russian linguistic norms in  the new states, such as the renaming of peoples and states (Kyrgyz instead of  Kirghiz, and Kyrgyzstan instead of Kirghizstan84), interpreting these as viola- tions of the norms of the Russian language. So what is the optimal strategy for linguistic policy in regards to Russian in  the post-Soviet states? It seems to me that most of these countries will preserve  Russian in their cultural arsenal in a national varietal form (Ukrainian Russian,  Kazakhstan Russian, Moldovan Russian, etc.), which will develop along parallel  </page> <page sequence="39"> Valery Tishkov | 35 tracks. At the same time the interaction of Russia and the other newly indepen- dent states will guarantee common, supranational tendencies towards linguistic  normalization and the leveling of differences between linguistic variants with- out their complete confl uence.85 In this situation, Russia cannot act as the sole  owner of the Russian language, but it was and remains the source country and  base for Russian-language cultural production. Russia must be ready to fulfi ll  this cultural and politically useful mission. Return of the Russian Language Despite its relative loss of position, some specialists argue convincingly that  Russian will retain its status as one of the so-called “world” or “top” languages.  The peak of Russian language usage came in 1990, when 350 million people  spoke the language to some degree or another, in more than 100 countries.86  Then Russian lost its status as the fi rst foreign language of instruction in many  of the world’s schools, and teaching of the language stopped entirely in many  others (Bulgaria, Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Cuba, and Vietnam). In  2000 the number of people fl uent in Russian had shrunk to 320 million, with  half these losses coming in the post-Soviet states.87  The retreat of Russian from the world arena was connected to the collapse  of the USSR and the fall in Russia’s international status and the reduction of its  foreign policy activities (the foreign Houses of Friendship were closed, as were  cultural centers and free language classes at embassies). The number of foreign  students studying in Russia dropped sharply. The place of Russian in some re- gions and spheres was, as a rule, taken by English, which at the end of the twen- tieth century was pushing out not only Russian, but also other languages.88 The situation began to change in favor of Russian again in the last decade.  One of the fi rst countries that brought Russian back into the school system was  Poland. In the last few years there has been intensive trade between Poland and  Russia, as well as between Poland and the border areas with Belarus, where the  populace speaks Russian. Economic factors proved to be stronger than political  considerations not just in Poland, but also in other countries of Eastern Europe,  where Russia has established economic and trade connections. The large coun- tries of Asia—China, Vietnam, India, Turkey—have been drawn into border  and small-lot trade and shopping tourism. Hundreds of thousands of traders  and migrant workers from China, Vietnam, and Turkey have learned Russian  in recent years. The shrinking of Russian has also abated in Western European  countries, and there has been a growth in interest in the study of the Russian  language in the United States and Japan. In the past ten years, countries like Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Greece,  Turkey, Egypt, Bulgaria, Croatia, Montenegro, and the Czech Republic have  seen enormous fl ows of Russian-speaking tourists from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus,  and other countries of the CIS. Tens of thousands of workers in tourism fi rms,  </page> <page sequence="40"> 36 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies merchandising and sales, and service industries have begun to master Russian,  which to a great degree defi nes the new wave of Russian’s spread in the world.  As T. B. Kryuchkova has written:  Of course, the maids, waiters, and bartenders don’t study Russian in universities  or in the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, but they master the language  to the degree necessary for their communicative needs that do not go into the  offi cial statistics of course numbers or other means. However, they use Russian  as an intermediary language, perhaps more intensively than do people who may  have studied Russian in high school or college because of fashion, left-wing views,  or academic interest.89  Besides economic factors, which have displaced ideological ones, a power- ful resource for the spread and habituation of Russian in Europe has been the  new Russian-speaking emigration. The principal difference between the most  recent wave of emigration and previous ones is that they preserve the language  and their ties with Russia. Migrants from other countries who are not ethnic  Russians also contribute to the support of the Russian language. These migrants  characteristically have multiple or conglomerate identities, but the uniting fac- tor for them is the Russian language.90  In the past ten to fi fteen years, Germany has became a country with sig- nifi cant Russian-speaking enclaves. Knowledge of Russian is in demand there  and is even given some priority in the labor market. In 2000 there were fi fteen  newspapers in the country published in Russian, and there are Russian-language  radio and TV stations. Many Russian-speaking emigrants try to ensure that their  children are bilingual. There are some schools in Germany where all subjects are  taught in both German and Russian. There are social organizations such as “The  Berlin Society of Russian-Speaking Parents and Teachers.”91 In France the de- mand for Russian instruction has grown strongly among new emigrants, people  in mixed marriages, and those coming from the former Soviet republics as well  as the descendants of the older emigrants. In 2006 the “Union of Russophones  in France” was established, with its activities focusing on supporting Russian  language and culture among immigrants from the former USSR and Russia. Language diversity in Europe is supported by a number of non-Anglophone  countries, and Russian is increasingly mentioned among the languages that re- quire support and distribution in international structures, since a large number  of inhabitants of Europe use Russian to communicate, particularly the new and  potential members of the European community. Russian is called a language of  the accomplishments of world civilization, and efforts are required to overcome  the negative stereotypes associated both with Russia and with the language it- self.92 The important role played by the spread in Europe of the ideology of  linguistic and cultural diversity must be noted, as it works in favor of Russian. Russian has a real chance to maintain and enlarge its world presence and  its role in world culture, economics, and politics. To this end Russia has es- tablished a whole range of programs and projects to foster Russian and to  </page> <page sequence="41"> Valery Tishkov | 37 support the interests and needs of Russian-speaking people living abroad. The  state organization Roszarubezhtsentr93 is much more active, as is the International  Association of Teachers of Russian Language and Literature (MAPRYaL).94  Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also actively trying to maintain Russian’s  position as a world language in various international organizations, including  a new initiative to make Russian one of the working languages of the World  Food Organization.  In Moscow in May 2007 then-Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev  announced that “our country today has suffi cient resources and possibility to  strengthen the status of Russian in the world, and to solve the problems that  Russian-speaking citizens of countries in the near and far abroad encounter.”95  There are indeed Russian state resources that could be added to those already  mentioned, since the British Council today spends €750 million to advance  English overseas, while the Goethe Institute spends €250 million to support  German. Almost that same amount is spent by France, Canada, and Belgium  for Francophone programs. In 2006, €8.5 million was allotted from the Russian  budget to support Russian abroad. This fi gure was increased several-fold in  2008, and the activities of the Russian World Fund will be fi nancially well  supported. However, there are absolutely no resources that would suffi ce “to solve the  problems that Russian-speaking citizens of countries in the near and far abroad  encounter,” nor are there suffi cient legal and other possibilities. These prob- lems must be resolved fi rst of all by those governments whose taxpayers are  Russian-speaking citizens and non-citizens, as well as by those who live in the  post-Soviet states themselves. Crises of the New Russian World Let us examine more closely the situation and prospects of the Russian diaspora  in three newly independent states, referring mainly to language and identity  issues. Estonia and Latvia Since no mass exodus of the Russian-speaking population occurred, the state  machinery of Estonia and Latvia has used a system of censuses and a policy  of assimilation to try to reduce the numbers of Russians in their countries. As  the former president of Latvia, Vaira Vike-Freiberg, announced, “The Russian  problem in Latvia is that there are too many of them.” To a certain degree this  policy has succeeded, and the Latvians form the majority of the population. There have been Russians living in what is now the territory of Latvia and  Estonia for countless generations. Latvia was one of the most important cen- ters of Old Believer Orthodoxy in the Russian Empire, while in the period of  independence between the two World Wars it was an area of Russian–German– </page> <page sequence="42"> 38 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies Latvian trilingualism, and in the Soviet period it had Russian and Latvian bilin- gualism.96 In Estonia Russian–Estonian bilingualism was widespread. In both  republics, the position of the national languages was very strong—there was  no linguistic assimilation toward Russian among Latvians and Estonians (the  exception was the group of “Siberian” Latvians who returned from Stalinist  exile). In the late Soviet period, national-language presses and television pro- grams were developed, as were encyclopedia publications, theater, literature,  and musical and vocal culture. Russian and the national languages in Soviet  times functioned as if they were in parallel linguistic worlds.97 In the view of  authoritative scholars, the migration policy of the “center” was not aimed at  “conscious Russifi cation,” and even less so at “ethnic cleansing, colonization, or  other measures of genocide” as local politicians and scholars in these countries  sometimes maintain.98 The social and cultural situation changed sharply after the collapse of the  USSR, and the Latvians and Estonians have been limiting the use of Russian  and the Russian cultural and historic legacy. I will analyze only one theme of  this battle in Estonia—the change in toponyms, or geographic names, in order  to remove Russian geographical terms and other connections with Russia. This  method of reconstructing a population’s identity is well known from history,  since spatial terms are one of many matrices for orienting collective and indi- vidual consciousness. In Russia itself, incidentally, there was a massive changing of names starting  in 1991–1992 with the goal of removing the Soviet/communist legacy. The  practice largely stopped after a lot of the population reacted negatively to re- moving the Soviet names—the names of the recent past. Although as a general rule toponyms must be in Estonian, a new law on  geographic names adopted in 2003 in Estonia permits exceptions “for historical  and cultural reasons.” If the local authorities have chosen a non-Estonian top- onym, then this must be confi rmed by the Minister of Regions in accordance  with the opinion of the Council on Geographic Names and also in view of the  language that the majority of the population of the given place spoke in 1939.   Remember that geographic names in Estonia have changed more than once.  Until the beginning of the twentieth century, many offi cial place names were  in German, and these German names were Russifi ed. During the fi rst period  of independence, place names were changed to Estonian, but the “German”  and “Russian” names were frequently used in daily life. At that time many vil- lages in the regions bordering Russia and on the banks of Chud Lake were also  Estonianized. For example, Kazapel became Kasepaa, Kikita became Kukita,  Alekseyevka became Nomme, Rayusha became Taja, Tikhotka became Tiheda,  Oleshnitsy became Alajoe, and so on. In many cases these were settlements that  had been founded by and were inhabited by Russian peasants and where the  Russian population remains the majority to this day. It is interesting that the  question of the restoration of Russian toponyms did not arise, for the Russian  </page> <page sequence="43"> Valery Tishkov | 39 population felt themselves to be at home, regardless of Estonian national policy,  and were little inclined to engage in social activism. Although the law on geographic terms does not prohibit reverting to the  old names of these places, in practice this has rarely happened. In its second  report on fulfi lling the framing conventions of the OSCE in protection of na- tional minorities, the Estonian republic’s government pointed to an additional  possibility covered by law: places could be known by two offi cial names. This  could be used to preserve a place’s “foreign name,” or return an earlier Estonian  one. These decisions can be taken by local authorities in agreement with the  Minister of Regions, who must confer with the Council on Geographic Names.  To the best of my knowledge, by the end of 2007, parallel names had been es- tablished for only a few historically Swedish villages in western Estonia. The town of Kallaste unsuccessfully tried to re-establish its historical Russian  name. On June 27, 2005, the town council of Kallaste decided to petition  to establish a parallel historical name “Krasnye Gory.” A settlement with that  name had been founded in the beginning of the eighteenth century by Russian  fi shermen, Old Believers who had moved from Russia to Estonia. Maps of the  time gave the Russian, the Germanized (Krasnogor) and the Estonian (Kallaste)  names. At the end of the nineteenth century the Russian name was the  offi cial one. In 1920 the settlement became a village, now with the Estonian  offi cial name. In 1938 Kallaste received the right to call itself a town. Besides  Kallaste, there was only one other Estonian village—Mustvee (Russian name  Chernoye)—that grew from a “Russian” settlement. Although the town council  of Kallaste decided to petition for the parallel name in June 2005, no approval  has been given or decision taken about what would seem to be an obvious  request. There is another problem with Russian toponyms. In its second opinion  about Estonia (February 24, 2005) the OSCE’s Consultative Committee on  the Framework Convention noted that the limited interest shown in the Lake  Chud region for double names might be because a “parallel name” had to be  written in the Latin alphabet. In the committee’s view, the permission to use the  Russian alphabet for double names might increase interest in the use of Russian  toponyms in the region. The Estonian authorities, though, were not willing to  make this change. There was no open dissatisfaction or other reaction from the  Russian population, which lacks social and political organizations of its own as  well as elected representatives in power.  My Russian sources say that the Russians in Estonia continue to use the  Russian names in conversations among themselves. It is possible that this is  enough for their current ethno-cultural needs. Those who represent the Russian  world in Estonia may perhaps have more important things to worry about—but  then what are they? One of these is to preserve the part of the Soviet identity  that was connected with victory against fascism in World War II, which pits  them against the revisionist versions of history in the Baltic countries. The  local  </page> <page sequence="44"> 40 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies Russians do not support pro-communist attitudes or forces, as was the case ten  years ago, but they want to preserve a part of their national collective pride.  They also want to preserve instruction in Russian in the educational system, a  problem that is particularly acute in Latvia. Ukraine  Ethnic Ukrainian nationalism dominates in Ukraine, and the greatest part of  the diaspora from Russia is ethnic Russian. One solution would be for Russia to  advocate a variant of Russian identity. This is not yet on Russia’s agenda. In fact,  many of the most extreme Russian nationalists in Russia are people who came  from Ukraine or are somehow connected with Ukraine. Russians in Ukraine are  not concerned with the feelings or interests of the Hungarians or Poles living  in Ukraine, nor are they interested in the ties of local Tartars and Chuvash to  Russia. They are concerned about the preservation of their own Russian iden- tity, and seek affi rmation of their Russianness by Russia. In accord with the obligations it accepted by entering the Council of  Europe, Ukraine must join the Charter of Regional or Minority Languages.99  The Ukrainian law “On Ratifi cation of the European Charter of Regional or  Minority Languages” was signed in 1999, but was declared unconstitutional  by a decision of the Constitutional Court of Ukraine on June 12, 2000. The  question was raised again in 2002, when Ukraine’s president Leonid Kuchma  presented the European Charter on Regional or Minority Languages to the  Upper Rada. The draft law on ratifi cation says that the charter applies to such  national minority languages as Belarusian, Bulgarian, Gagauz, Greek, Yiddish,  Crimean–Tatar, Moldavian, Polish, German, Russian, Romanian, Slovakian,  and Hungarian. It passed on May 15, 2003, although Deputy Justice Minister  Valeria Lutkovskaya has recently brought up the possibility of Ukraine seeking  to amend the law.100  The Constitution makes Ukrainian the state language. In addition, it guar- antees the “free development, use, and defense of Russian and other languages  of the national minorities of Ukraine.” This problem is also addressed by other  legislation and laws: the Law on National Minorities in Ukraine; the Declaration  of National Rights in Ukraine; and the Concept of Cultural Development of  National Minorities in Ukraine. The Law on National Minorities in Ukraine  gives a state guarantee of the right for national minorities to use and study  their native language in state early education institutions or through national  cultural societies. The state is also obligated to prepare specialists for pedagogic,  cultural-educational, and other teaching institutions. A statement on govern- ment obligations is also found in Article III of the Declaration of Rights of  Nationalities in Ukraine: “The Ukrainian government guarantees all nation- alities and national groups the right to use their native language freely in all  sphere of public life, including education, manufacturing, and the receipt and  dissemination of information.”101 </page> <page sequence="45"> Valery Tishkov | 41 Thus at the legislative level, the country has created conditions to realize and  defend the rights of national minorities. Ukrainian legislation in this regard does  not contradict international legal norms and many international experts regard  it as one of the most democratic in existence. Nevertheless, a fundamental lan- guage problem remains, creating tension in public life in the country, a problem  that could become a source of open confl ict and even result in a rupture. The problem is connected to the fact that Russian has the status of a minor- ity language, equal to all other minority languages, rather being viewed as one  of the two basic languages of the majority of the country’s taxpayers. Russian in  Ukraine can not be compared to Gagauz,102 because the great majority of Gagauz  themselves are Russian-speaking citizens of the country. Their Orthodox faith  and their linguistic behavior make the Gagauz part of the Russian world, at  least for now, as most Gagauz are not native speakers of Ukrainian and still have  cultural and spiritual ties to Russia. Frustrated with their treatment, Russians have been pressing regional author- ities to afford Russian equal status with the state language. In 1996 the Kharkov  City Council decided to use Russian in document exchanges within the local  government equally with the state language. That decision was contested by the  procurator’s offi ce, but the city council refused to yield to the protest, follow- ing which the legality of the decision was considered in the courts. In 2001 the  Supreme Court of Ukraine ruled that the city council had exceeded its author- ity in taking a decision on bilingualism. The city council refused to follow the  court’s decision and instead held a consultative referendum in the city on the  offi cial use of Russian. The citizens were asked to answer this question: “Do you  agree that in Kharkov Russian must be used equally with the state language in  all spheres of public life?” The poll was conducted as a vote on March 3, 2001,  during which more than 533,000 people (82 percent of respondents) expressed  support for using Russian alongside the state language.  In September 2002 the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast Council and the Collegium  of the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast State Administration proposed holding an all- Ukrainian referendum on giving Russian the status of state language. The status  of the Russian language was considered in the Lugansk Oblast Council, which  on November 21, 2002 adopted an appeal to the Upper Rada of Ukraine to give  Russian the status of a state language. At a session of the Crimean Parliament in  2002 the deputies called on the Upper Rada to adopt a law, “On Introducing  Changes to the Constitution of Ukraine to Give Russian the Status of Second  State Language.” There was subsequently an appeal by the State Duma of the Russian  Federation to the Upper Rada of Ukraine. Acknowledging the offi cial status  of Russian would, in the view of the Russian parliamentarians, strengthen the  age-old tradition of Russian–Ukrainian bilingualism, and would also broaden  the participation of the young generation in the process of integration, and  serve the further development of scientifi c and cultural connections between  </page> <page sequence="46"> 42 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies the intelligentsia of the two countries. In their turn, the appeal said, the par- liamentarians of the lower house of the Russian parliament would do all they  could to facilitate the development of Ukrainian in places of heavy Ukrainian  settlement in Russia, and thus guarantee the right of every citizen living in  Russian to receive education in his or her native language. As we see, the problem of the status of Russian in some regions of Ukraine  has become politicized, and the way in which census data about national lan- guage is collected has exacerbated some of these tensions.103 Formally, the ethnic  Russian minority in Ukraine is comprised of 11,355,000 people, which by itself  is already comparable to the population of some European states. In addition,  the problem of the status of Russian involves the interests not only of ethnic  Russians, but also those of all who claim Russian as their native language, some  17 million people in Ukraine (one-third of the population). Besides Russians,  this includes Ukrainians (4,578,000, according to the census), Belarusians,  Bulgars, Jews, Greeks, Gagauz, and others—that is, representatives of practi- cally all national minorities. Russian-speaking communities are found throughout the country.  However, in nine eastern and southern oblasts—Sumskaya, Kharkovskaya,  Luganskaya, Donetskaya, Dnepropetrovskaya, Zaprozhskaya, Khersonskaya,  Nokolayevskaya, Odesskaya, and the Autonomous Republic of Crimea—the  Russian-speaking population is in the majority. This territory holds more than  26 million people, of whom Russian speakers number 14 million, or 53 percent  of the population. Over time, support for Russian being granted an offi cial status in Ukraine  has declined somewhat. In 1995, 52 percent of respondents said “yes,” to  the question “Do you think that Russian should be given offi cial status in  Ukraine?” while 33 percent said “no,” and 15 percent answered “do not know.”  In 2001, the answers were 47 percent “yes,” 36 percent “no” and 16 percent  “don’t know.”104 This data also demonstrates the continued bilingual character  of Ukraine’s population, despite diffi culties in using Russian in business, scien- tifi c research, and, in part, in education. The strictly enforced introduction of Ukrainian in traditionally Russian- speaking regions that has been carried out in recent years has deepened the  polarization of Ukrainian society and could lead to inter-ethnic tension. The  state language policy in Ukraine should be formed taking into account the  ethno-cultural and linguistic traditions that exist in society. In accordance with  international standards of resolving language problems in multi-ethnic societ- ies, the demands of the eastern regions of Ukraine to give Russian status as a  state language should be supported. Uzbekistan  In 1996, Uzbekistan was estimated to be 80 percent Uzbek, 5.5 percent Russian,  5 percent Tajik, 3 percent Kazakh, 2.5 percent Karakalpak, 1.5 percent Tartar,  </page> <page sequence="47"> Valery Tishkov | 43 and 2.5 percent other nationalities.105 Russians are the second-largest ethnic  group in the republic. They suffer psychological discomfort for acknowledging  their transition from a position as the “national majority” (in the framework of  the former USSR) to that of a “national minority” in the republic. The transi- tion to a state language has been complicated, as it affects prospects for govern- ment service, education, and work. The majority of the Russian population of Uzbekistan lives in the cities, con- stituting 36 percent of the 2.5 million people in Tashkent. There are about 80  national/cultural centers in the republic, joined into the International Cultural  Center of Uzbekistan. These include the Russian Cultural Center of Uzbekistan,  in Tashkent. That is also the home of the Russian City Cultural Center. Almost  all 11 oblasts and the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan have oblast-level  cultural centers. Unlike in the Baltic countries and in Ukraine, the Russian population of  Uzbekistan has left the country in large numbers, most moving to Russia.  Emigrants have moved in large numbers to Moskovskaya, Voronezhskaya,  Saratovskaya, Tambovskaya, Samaraskaya, and Nizhegorodskaya oblasts, and to  the city of Moscow. The fl ow of immigrants to Russia shrank in 1996–1997,  but a signifi cant fl ow of illegal or unregistered ethnic Uzbeks continues. Young  people come to work and serve to create the material conditions for the further  migration of the remaining members of their families. Others do seasonal work  in Russia in the summer and fall, and then spend the winter in Uzbekistan. Russians and Russian speakers also have moved to Kazakhstan. In 1997, for  example, 12 percent of the internal migration (within the CIS) of Uzbekistan’s  population went there. In the 1990s Uzbekistan lost about a million people,  mostly to other states in the CIS and the Baltic countries. A signifi cant part of  those who left were the educated, and many had secondary or higher profes- sional training. A large part of the skilled segment of the population has fl owed  away in the past ten years, primarily to Russia, but also to Israel, the United  States, and other countries. Russians comprised about half of those who left  Uzbekistan.106 The departure of the Russian population was partly for economic reasons,  and partly out of concern for the future of their children. The language situa- tion played a large part in the departure as well. The republic’s “Law on State  Language,” in its new edition, was adopted in 1995.107 The parliamentary and  government sessions are conducted in Uzbek. Uzbek functions as the state lan- guage in practically all spheres of the republic’s life. However, Article 3 of the  law states: “Citizens have the right to choose their language of inter-ethnic  communication as they wish.” In cities where there is a dense Russian popula- tion, the language of inter-ethnic communication remains Russian. Although the law does not defi ne a place for Russian or accord it any rights,  Russian in Uzbekistan is not just a language of communication between mem- bers of different nationalities. My observations and certain oblique data make  </page> <page sequence="48"> 44 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies it possible to say that Russian is the main language of knowledge and commu- nication (that is, native language) for practically all of the non-Uzbek popula- tion, and for not less than a quarter of the Uzbeks themselves, among whom  bilingualism is very widespread.108  For example, among Uzbeks in Tashkent, 14 percent named Russian as their  native language, as did 34 percent of Tartars, 94 percent of Koreans, and 10  percent of Kazakhs and Tajiks.109 But one suspects that the fi gure is actually  higher, as when the question was posed, “What language do you think in?” the  following answers were received: all Russians think in Russian; as do 28 percent  of Uzbeks; 76 percent of the Tartars, 98 percent of the Koreans; 30 percent  of the Kazakhs; and 20 percent of the Tajiks.110 This all means that it is not  just Russians in Uzbekistan who make up the Russian-speaking population;  many other nationalities, including Koreans, went entirely over to Russian two  or three generations ago. The linguistic rights of this group are violated even  more seriously than are those of the Russians, since they have little possibility  of moving to Russia. My informant, a Russian-speaking Korean named Galina  Shergay, whose parents were deported from the Far East to Uzbekistan just  before World War II, moved to Moscow ten years ago to look for work and  a chance to remain in Russia. Efforts to resettle her permanently have so far  proven fruitless because of legal restrictions for citizens of the new states. The Russian-speaking population of Uzbekistan is pained by the narrow- ing of the sphere of Russian’s use. Limiting access to the press from Russia  and Russian-language publication causes dissatisfaction, as does reduction of  radio and TV broadcasting in Russian (state channel 4 and private channel 30  broadcast in Russian), and the reduction of the hours for the study of Russian  language and literature in the schools. Nevertheless, Russian is broadly used.  It is enough to say that the great majority of resources of the Uzbek Internet  are in Russian. In 2005 there were 315 general education schools in Tashkent,  of which 163 conducted lessons in Uzbek, 53 in Russian, and 99 in both lan- guages. In the country as a whole, there are 121 schools with Russian language  instruction and 650 schools with mixed-language instruction, where one of the  languages is Russian.111 There are Russian departments and divisions in many  of the country’s higher education institutions. Unlike Kyrgyzstan or Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan is not about to give Russian  the status of an offi cial or state language, since Uzbekistan has a different ethno- demographic and political situation. In the Soviet period linguistic assimila- tion to Russian affected Uzbekistan less, since the majority of the republic’s  population lived in the countryside, where the Russian-speaking population  was more limited. In practice, however, Russian is widely used in Uzbekistan,  even in the courts, as I was informed by L. Matytsina, a jurist with many years  of experience. Though citing no specifi c examples, she argued that the lack of  Uzbek language skills was grounds for refusing someone work, adding, “It also  is true that Russians are in no hurry to learn the state language.” In her opinion,  </page> <page sequence="49"> Valery Tishkov | 45 discrimination against Russians exists primarily on the level of daily life. Uzbek  nationalism is fairly strong in the country, and it also has powerful ideological  and political support from above, beginning fi rst and foremost with President  Karimov. In Uzbekistan displays of prejudice against Russians occur primarily in the  oblasts and regions, from migrants from the kishlaks (villages) who come to the  cities seeking work as there is a shortage of arable land and unemployment in the  rural areas. Many of these people know little or no Russian, have had no contacts  with Russians and see them primarily as rivals and as former colonizers. After the collapse of the Soviet Union and Uzbekistan’s declaration of inde- pendence, Russians began being squeezed out of management positions. Under  communist rule, Russians had traditionally held the number two post in any  position of authority and served as a surrogate for Moscow’s interests. With  independence, access to the majority of places in the state sector (state admin- istration, tax and customs services, law enforcement, and the legal organs) was  made more diffi cult for Russians and Russian-speakers. However, at the large,  technology-intensive production units, Russians were still able to retain top po- sitions. The general directors of the fl agships of Uzbek industry—the Tashkent  aviation factory, the Almalyk metallurgical kombinat, the mining and metal- lurgical kombinat in the town of Navoi—have been Russians, where they also  constitute 90 percent of the workers and the engineering and technical staff.  At the same time Russians have gained wider possibilities for private large- and  small-scale business enterprises. While Uzbeks predominate in trade, construc- tion, “shuttle trading,”112 and in transport businesses, Russians continue to  work in “intellectual” trades—computers, Internet-technologists, repair of ma- chine tools and other complex instruments. However, in recent times Russians  have become more active in petty trade and in retail. For example, in Tashkent  and other large cities the book business and trade in audio-video products and  compact discs has become the prerogative of Russians. To a certain degree Uzbekistan and the city of Tashkent are the spiritual  center of the Russian and Russian-speaking population for all of Central Asia.  This is the home of the Central Asian Eparchial Administration of the Russian  Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. Vladyka Vladimir, the metro- politan of Tashkent and Central Asia, thinks that Uzbekistan is actively de- veloping an inter-religious dialogue between the two traditional faiths, Islam  and Orthodoxy. In 1995 land was allotted in the city and construction was  begun for an administrative center for the Orthodox Church’s Central Asian  and Tashkent eparchy, where the fi rst seminary in the Central Asian region  was opened. While before independence there were Orthodox parishes only in  Tashkent and Samarkand, they have now also been opened in Bukhara, Navoi,  Karsh, Syrdarya, Zarashan and Uchkuduk (the latter two heavily Russian set- tlements). A monastery and two convents have also opened. The eparchy has  begun to publish its fi rst newspaper, Slovo zhizni.113 In answer to the question,  </page> <page sequence="50"> 46 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies “What most disturbs the Russian and Russian-speaking population today?”  Father Vladimir replied, “Religious fanaticism and extremism.” The Russian population, just like the Uzbek population, is more concerned  today about questions of security than about social and economic problems.  The Russian population supports President Karimov out of fear of religious  extremist groups. They voted for him in recent presidential elections partially  because he is taking strict measures against the radicals. The Uzbek parliament,  the Oliy Mazhlis, has 250 deputies. The Russian population is represented by  8 deputies. As a point of comparison, there are 7 Karakalpaks, 3 Kazakhs, 2  Tajiks, and one each of Ukrainians, Koreans, and Armenians. The president of  the Russian Cultural Center of Uzbekistan, S. Zinin, is a parliamentary deputy  and chairs the committee on science and culture. On the whole, the prospects for the Russian-speaking population in  Uzbekistan look like this: this will be a state with a steadily growing domina- tion by the titular nationality, but the Russian presence will remain at the level  of an infl uential but ethnically unconsolidated minority. Russia’s infl uence on  Uzbekistan, just as on the other states of Central Asia, can only be minimal,  and will come most often in the form of assisting ethnic Russians and Tartars to  move to Russia, not to strengthen their positions in Uzbekistan. Conclusion Diasporas can have strong vested interest infl uencing the policies that the coun- try of origin adopts toward the country of residence. Diasporas also remain in- terested in the policies of their country of origin—is the government strength- ening the security and well-being of their motherland, or is it the reverse, having  a destructive effect? This question is important for diasporas because, in many  cases, they continue to count on the possibility of a return to the land of their  birth, if the conditions in the country to which they have moved or live worsen,  or the conditions in the country they left improve. Even without the possibility  of a return, there is also a symbolic interest to have a motherland that is success- ful and has a positive image, so that this image can help them to better support  and defend their personal identity against the challenge of assimilation in the  land to which they have moved. In the past, Russia’s negative image lowered the desire of emigrants to call  themselves “Russians” in their new countries. Naturally that external rejection  leads to an internal collision of group and individual identities—is it worth nour- ishing in oneself something that it is hard to take pride in openly, something that  does not help one but rather makes things harder? Such motives can prompt a  disapora to try to change the policies of their state of origin in ways they believe  are good for them and for the government. Work for the well-being and positive  image of the state of birth is the most common and, it would seem, entirely natu- ral variant of a diaspora’s behavior. This is not always the case, however. </page> <page sequence="51"> Valery Tishkov | 47 Many who have left Russia still hold fairly skeptical or even negative at- titudes toward their country of origin. This is particularly true of those whose  families left revolution and civil war, during the periods of the Stalinist repres- sions, or because of Brezhnev’s persecution of dissidents. For some of these  people, the trauma remains with them. But it is hard for me to understand why  their attitudes are sustained when the politics of the country of origin have sub- stantially changed, bringing democratic rule, a market economy, and allowing  for voluntary entry and exit. These negative attitudes are also sustained even  though the emigrant benefi ted from education (a kind of “start-up capital”) and  a rich history, culture, and language. In part this negative image is fed by the social surroundings and the policies  of the country that accepts the emigrant. For this reason the image of Russia  and Russians (as a collective noun for those from Russia) remains low and is  likely to remain so, in part because of the negative depiction of Russia’s trans- formation by experts, the media, and political opposition. This attitude is also  nourished in the receiving countries through the inertia of the Cold War men- tality, and the continued need for a large enemy as a means of consolidating  one’s own society or state coalition.   For many countries Russia plays the role of just that sort of major threat  or potential threat, even when the countries’ presidents are friends. The di- aspora notices this situation and chooses the negative variant, rather than the  positive one, with regard to Russia. Sometimes the diaspora suffers because of  this. More frequently it works to their advantage, as it makes people sympa- thetic, facilitating legal status, getting grants, or fi nding work, and there is no  consequence for them in their country of origin. A person in the diaspora can  criticize Russia and its policies in the toughest possible way, and even work for  employers (like the media) who discredit Russia as an authoritarian government  or a new mini-empire, and they are able still to travel to Russia and may even  be greeted as a hero. Negation of Russia is fashionable, even in Russia itself.  Distancing from Russia, its history, culture, and language became a base for the  post-Soviet states’ nation-building and for their integration into Euro-Atlantic  coalitions and alliances. In a number of countries, including those in the Baltics, the Russian-speak- ing population has not yet become a political base for Russia, and is unlikely to  become one. It is more likely that young local Russians, once they have learned  Estonian and Latvian, as well as English, will serve in the armed forces of the  NATO countries, placing their civic responsibility above their ethno-cultural  identity. At least, such is the world practice in diaspora behavior. The Baltic  countries will not be an exception. It is also world practice though that Russians  will not assimilate to become Estonians or Latvians, both much smaller linguistic  and cultural communities. It is not clear to me how this dramatic contradiction  will be worked out in the future, but most likely it will be decided on the basis of  two communities of equal status in the populations of Estonia and Latvia. </page> <page sequence="52"> 48 | The Russian World—Changing Meanings and Strategies Because of the real linguistic situation and internationally-recognized lin- guistic rights, Russian has grounds on which to become an offi cial language in  those countries in which a signifi cant part of the taxpayers use it as their main  language of knowledge and communication. Given international legal norms,  Russia cannot drop the issue of offi cial bilingualism for a number of the for- mer Soviet Union states (Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Latvia, Moldova, the Kyrgyz  Republic). If the equal status of Russians is not acknowledged, then Russia  can support both forms of internal self-determination by culturally distinct  groups—ethno-territorial through a federalization in a range of post-Soviet  states, where there are more or less homogenous areas of Russian settlement, or  through extra-territorial cultural autonomy, as is already practiced in a range of  newly independent states. In Estonia and Latvia, as in societies that have stronger civil societies, all- citizen principles of state building will sooner or later take hold. Local “ non- n atives” (that is, Russian diasporas in the broadest sense) can also build their  identity on a “conglomerate” basis, such as for example, Balto-Slavism. In  Ukraine and Kazakhstan, where ethno-nationalism will not slacken, and where  there is the largest Russian diaspora, which will not assimilate, the Russian eth- nic variant may prove preferable. Russians in Ukraine are concerned about pre- serving their own Russian identity, including through a policy of “Russian-ness  in Russia.” That is why the Russian world in Estonia and Latvia may see  “Russian-ness” as a starting point, while the Russian world in Ukraine will fi nd  “Russian-ness” or ethnic Russianism a more signifi cant factor in their group  identity and cultural affi liation. Usually diasporic communities play the role of humanitarian and business  bridges between their “historical homeland” and the countries they live in, serv- ing at the same time as a political lobby and a cultural business card for the  country from which they came. Russia only now is realizing the importance of  constructing a friendly and infl uential Russian world as a resource for forming  a positive image of the country and for resolving problems in foreign relations.  How can the Russian world be made friendly for Russia and infl uential in the  rest of the world, where its representatives live? There are a lot of questions here,  and they demand more than a trivial approach to “supporting our country- men overseas” through often provocative offi cial statements. The concept of the  Russian world and the Russian Federation’s devotion of growing resources in  support of Russophonia represent innovative and promising steps to strengthen  the state and its national interest. It should lead to many winners and no losers.        </page> <page sequence="53"> Valery Tishkov | 49 Notes 1  Tishkov uses “rossiyskiy” here, meaning “of the Russian state,” rather than “russkiy,”  which is an ethnic marker (and is the adjective used in the title).

Founded in 1910,  Carnegie is nonpartisan and dedicated to achieving practical results. Through  research, publishing, convening and, on occasion, creating new institutions and  international networks, Endowment associates shape fresh policy approaches.  Their interests span geographic regions and the relations between governments,  business, international organizations, and civil society, focusing on the econom- ic, political, and technological forces driving global change. Building on the successful establishment of the Carnegie Moscow Center,  the Endowment has added operations in Beijing, Beirut, and Brussels to its  existing offi ces in Washington and Moscow, pioneering the idea that a think  tank whose mission is to contribute to global security, stability, and prosperity  requires a permanent international presence and a multinational outlook at the  core of its operations. The Endowment publishes Foreign Policy, one of the world’s leading jour- nals of international politics and economics, which reaches readers in more  than 120 countries and in several languages. For more information, visit www. CarnegieEndowment.org. With a set of distinguished experts in Washington and a talented group of  Russian policy analysts at the Carnegie Moscow Center, the Russia and Eurasia  Program brings unique resources to the study of policy issues relating to Russia  and the other post-Soviet republics. Through research, publishing, seminars,  conferences, exchanges, and other public outreach activities, the Program pro- motes informed public debate and provides insights and knowledge to policy  makers in both the United States and Russia on key economic, political, and  security topics. 59 </page> <page sequence="64"> Carnegie Papers Carnegie Papers present new research by Endowment associates and their collabora- tors from other institutions.
