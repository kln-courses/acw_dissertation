<plain_text><page sequence="1">Walter Bagehot. The Constitution of the English by Robert Colls It is not my business to examine whether the English actually enjoy this liberty, or not. Sufficient it is for my purpose to observe, that it is established by their laws; and I enquire no further. Charles-Louis de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu, The Spirit of Laws, 1750 In 1960, John Plamenatz observed the English. He saw them as personally reticent, a characteristic which he contrasted with their role in public affairs which he saw as exemplary: To understand social institutions ... is not to understand how people feel. The English, who are the most successful politically of all European peoples, and who have contributed as much as any people to the social sciences, are perhaps rather slow at understanding feelings they do not share. Few things are more striking about them than the contrast between this dullness and their acuteness when they discuss impersonal matters (italics mine).1 History Workshop Journal Issue 46 C) History Workshop Journal 1998</page><page sequence="2">98 History Workshop Journal Plamenatz was a Montenegrin by birth and, by election, a Fellow of Nuffield College Oxford. Gustaaf Johannes Renier, another outsider, also noted this reticence in 1931 when he referred to 'the original sin of self revelation', but Renier's 'English' - 'the unintellectual, restricted, stubborn, steady, pragmatic, silent and reliable English' - were more precisely defined. He was talking only about middle-class English men. Renier liked them, of course, and, in the Anglophile manner, he was gently sardonic about their repressions. But in their persons, the Dutchman doubted whether they could ever really be known. Behind their understatement, practicality, and taste for apparently mindless convention, there was an inner-life which had to be kept secret: Throughout the day, the Englishman performs acts and pronounces words, not because they have significance in themselves, but because they happen to be the acts and words which, for one reason or another, it is deemed right to perform and pronounce.2 Men such as these wielded their power astutely but, on balance, he joked, bore only a passing resemblance to human beings. Renier lectured in history at University College, London. It goes without saying that his book, The English. Are they Human? was immensely popular and went through two editions and five impressions up to 1939. In 1867, Walter Bagehot published his classic work, The English Consti- tution. Students of the constitution begin with this book. It is not the consti- tution, but it has often been treated as such. Nor is it the last word, but it has certainly come to be seen as the first. Bagehot also presented himself as a man on the outside. Yet, as a professional journalist with wide contacts and close experience of parliamentary business, he reckoned he knew how power was implemented on the inside. From this vantage, he tackled the most pressing political problem of his day: how could the constitution admit a large number of working-class men, a million 'hard hands' of uncertain temper, and still remain stable? Enfranchisement would change everything. How could the system cope? Bagehot knew that English political power was not as it had been por- trayed. In practice, if not in theory, there was no balance between the execu- tive and the legislature. Rather, through ministers meeting in Cabinet, executive and legislative powers had become fused. Ministerial influence over party majorities was such that ministers could get all the legislation they wanted and govern without let or hindrance. Such a centralized appar- atus did not accord with the myths of parliamentary liberty. The dual rep- resentation of the interests of Lords and Commons, the historic suspicion of over centralized states, the checks and balances between executive and legislature - all these peculiarities of the English were not accurate descrip- tions of how the system actually worked. At the same time, Bagehot recog- nized that the system's propensity for effective government turned on a</page><page sequence="3">The Constitution of the English 99 concentration of power. The trouble was that neither a new protean working class nor an old embedded aristocracy could be trusted with that power: the workers, because they were neither calm enough nor rational enough to do what was right; the aristocrats, because there could be no going back to the ancien regime and because they were not democratic either by instinct or competence. Only the middle class could be trusted. Within the constitution the other two classes would have to be found differ- ent roles. In order to nullify the threat of each to the centre, it might be that their respective failings could be put together at the edge. The problem in 1867, then, was how to construct strong, apparently liberal but in fact undemocratic government, whilst maintaining a public role for the awkward classes? This was a problem all the more pressing because, since the death of Albert in 1861, Queen Victoria had been in un- official retirement. The monarch's unwillingness to perform her royal duties, including the state opening of Parliament, had led to a rising tide of republicanism, especially in the metropolis. Bagehot's solution, a mixture of description and prescription, was to split the constitution into two parts. First, the 'dignified' part, seen essentially as monarch and peers who, though increasingly bereft of political power, would render such a fine show that the masses would be persuaded that in spite of the onset of democracy nothing more had changed. While the dignified led the parade, the masses would gawp. Second, the 'efficient' part, seen as a new aristocracy of bour- geois politicians who would rule effectively through cabinet government. While the old aristocratic and monarchical show went on, behind it, the state, in Marx's words, would become 'the executive committee of the bour- geoise'.3 Bagehot was happy to call this concentration of political power 'efficient' but his main point was that if this was the bourgeois revolution which the English were never supposed to have had, then it must be kept secret. Herein lay the 'noble lie', or the 'efficient secret', of modern political power operating behind an elaborate screen of ancient dignity. At the edge, 'the mass of the English people [will] yield the deference rather to something else than to their rulers. They [will] defer to what we may call the theatri- cal show of society'. At the centre, middle-class Englishmen must remem- ber that they could not appear to be what they actually were: The English constitution in its palpable form is this - the mass of the people yield obedience to a select few; and when you see this select few, you perceive that though not of the lowest class, nor of an unrespectable class, they are yet of a heavy sensible class - the last people in the world to whom, if they were drawn up in a row, an immense nation would ever give an exclusive preference.4 Some years before, John Stuart Mill had warned against the very objectives Bagehot came to set himself. Mill was fearful, especially in a democracy,</page><page sequence="4">100 History Workshop Journal that 'a government of sufficiently popular constitution might be trusted with any amount of power over the nation, since its power would only be that of the nation over itself'. He thought it was a mistake to suppose that only bad governments needed checking. All states should have their 'beak and claws' clipped because even the 'delegates of the people, that is, of a majority, are quite as ready (when they think they can count on popular support) as any organs of oligarchy to assume arbitrary power'. It might have been that Bagehot learned from these wise words - made wiser still in On Liberty (1859) - but for him the problem was practical before it was moral. Mill had optimistically judged in 1859 that the English had a politi- cal history which had taught them to be suspicious of central power, but in the end, he, the inferior strategist, was proved wrong and Bagehot, the inferior thinker, was proved right. The English followed Bagehot's liberal- ism, not Mill's.5 Between them, Plamenatz, Renier and Bagehot cover the major themes of this article. Plamenatz's observation that the English preferred to hide their persons, Renier's observation that in place of those persons was offered a facade of convention, Bagehot's observation that their power could survive only behind that facade - all have been key features of modern Englishness. About that Englishness, this article will present its case in five stages. First, it will argue that concealment and performance were central to the character of the 'new' English gentleman from the late seventeenth century onwards. Gentlemanliness was severed from its material base. Defoe's English Tradesman and English Gentleman both sug- gested how. Of course, it was expected that one should have land and come from an old family, but it was not essential and those who were trying to float free needed the arts of concealment and performance to sustain the illusion. Second, the article will suggest how these arts became embedded in constitutionalism and how, in turn, constitutionalism became embedded in modem understandings of English life and character. Third, the article will consider official and unofficial secrecy and fourth, how state secrecy joined with the constitutional precepts of 'convention' and 'prerogative' to provide British governments with almost uncheckable power. Finally, I will press the case that, far from being a feature of only pre-modern states, per- sonal authority continues to be a vital part of government. Looked at through the eyes of English constitutionalism, it is wrong to hold that what makes states 'modem' is their degree of impersonality. We have been invited to trust a constitution almost indistinguishable from the ascribed personality of the men we have invited to govern us. In the twentieth century the middle-class Englishman was seen as a personification of this constitution and in that certain sense he constituted the nation. This allowed politicians and civil servants to do more or less as they pleased without appearing to have acted un-constitutionally - an arrangement which went far beyond politics in its implications and which dominated from the 1870s to the 1950s.</page><page sequence="5">The Constitution of the English 101 1 Concealment was not new to English politics. Bagehot's view was that the monarchy had been denied real power since 1688, but the Whig aristocracy had concealed the fact to protect their own position. Between 1688 and 1701 the state retained its option on a monarchy, but the big aristocracy set out the terms and the conditions of what sort of monarchy it should be. The battle over terms and conditions had started long before, in the 1620s, when Parliament insisted on its right to guide the fiscal evolution of the English state. Representation and taxation were key issues in the Civil War and, in the Bill of Rights of 1689 and the Acts which followed - for regular parlia- ments 1694, for a civil list 1697 and for a proper succession 1701 - Parlia- ment showed its will to decide what should be what and who should be monarch. After the succession of Protestant George in 1714 and the defeat of the Stuart rebellions in 1715 and 1746, the 1688-1701 settlement was allowed to settle. The British still had kings, but kingship did not mean power. Royal influence and prerogative was another matter however, and the problem of how to conceal it had fundamental implications which we will return to later. With the enfranchisement of middle-class men in 1832, and the decline of aristocratic political power which inevitably followed, Bagehot reckoned that the state had become little more than a concealed republic - a 'republic' he saw it as his job to turn into a modern state. Mod- ernity meant some sort of democracy, but still he thought that aristocratic decline, like monarchical decline before it, could be concealed. There are various time spans one can adopt for the decline of these 15,000 aristocratic families as a political force. The medium span would be between 1846, when they were described as 'the possessors of all and everything in England', to 1871, when The Times could say that 'the common people tol- erate and even admire the social aristocracy'.6 From 1832 to 1914, or from 1880 to 1980, have each been suggested as longer spans. The shortest span would be from 1828 to 1835, with the revolutionary opening-up of the state and with it the penetration of provincial businessmen, and dissenters.7 Sons of the substantial gentry still dominated county and national government, with 407 MPs in 1868, but they were down to around 150 by 1910 and their grip on the counties was much weaker after the reforms of the 1890s. What- ever time span one adopts, the aristocracy lost much of their state power during the nineteenth century but concealed it by a corresponding 'prolifer- ation in decorative jobs and plumage positions'. They remained socially pre- eminent; there was still much to perform. Their wealth remained as great, if not greater, and their role as the great and the good in the Empire, on com- missions, on committees and fine-sounding boards, or as part of the para- phernalia of universities and other civic and county institutions, became nearly obligatory. All this pomp and circumstance, as David Cannadine has reminded us, 'required a real degree of self effacement'.8 Decline was further concealed by the ease with which the bourgeoisie</page><page sequence="6">102 History Workshop Journal had long mixed their genealogies, as well as their bank balances, into the aristocratic pot. Thackeray spotted Mr Pump, the 'Great City Snob', in Lombard Street in 1847. Rich bankers like him were a species noted by their taste for aristocratic marriages: I like to see an old aristocrat swelling with pride of face, the descendent of illustrious Norman robbers, whose blood has been pure for centuries, and who looks down on common Englishmen as a free-born American does on a nigger. I like to see old STIFFNECK obliged to bow down his head and swallow his infernal pride, and drink the cup of humiliation poured out by PUMP and ALDGATE's butler. 'PUMP and ALDGATE', says he, 'your grandfather was a bricklayer, and his hod is still kept in the bank. Your pedigree begins in a workhouse; mine can be dated from all the royal palaces of Europe'.9 Of course, there never was a pure and original pedigree. To find such a thing one would have had to start with William in 1066. Even then, no class in Saxon England was more nouveau riche than William's invaders (a persist- ent theme in early English radicalism). Not many eighteenth-century aris- tocratic families could pass the Conquest test. Recruitment through biology is precarious. Because the male line is always failing, a biologically pure aris- tocracy is demographically impossible. Where biology could not, culture must. Nineteenth-century English historiography naturalized bourgeois resistance to central dynastic power as the fruits of freedom long planted in the English personality, and apparent even before the Conqueror. The Normans had not trampled English freedom but had themselves been trans- formed by it, or so the story went. Accordingly so, the English could never lose a battle, even the Battle of Hastings. Similarly, English bourgeois revolutions were never revolutions so much as welcome transfusions into the status quo ante. As the Stones have told us, the English aristocracy were an open elite, surviving six great crises from 1590 to 1880 by a capacity to refresh themselves in the well-springs of the bourgeoisie: It is tempting to suggest that what distinguished English society from that of Europe was not the volume of mobility so much as the relative lack of legal, cultural or psychological obstacles to the assimilation of new- comers. 'Beau' Nash formalized the assimilation of newcomers in the Pump and Assembly rooms of eighteenth-century Bath. What Oliver Goldsmith said of him could be applied equally to all those aristocratic-bourgeois refine- ments which Nash encoded for polite society in general - 'once admitted into the circle of the Beau Monde, he then laid claim to all the privileges by which it is distinguished'.10 The English 'gentleman' was the direct product of hundreds of years of</page><page sequence="7">The Constitution of the English 103 aristocratic-bourgeois cultural crossbreeding. There were a host of names for the gentlemanly class - from aristocracy to gentry, from the upper class to the simply Rich - all of them finely graded and all of them related to an ideal condition of landedness. English gentlemen were never alienated from the state or the market in the way their European counterparts could be, but land still remained their basic security. Courage was an aristocratic virtue often displayed, for instance, in gaming clubs, but courage without land to back it was a bad risk and not decent. When decency was challenged, then it all depended on honour, and a gentleman's honour, down to the lowest gentlemanly grade of 'mashers' and 'swells', was never less than theatrical. Gentlemen could be wealthy, with estates, or they could be threadbare, but they could all still be gents in so far as gentlemanliness was first and foremost a matter of public performance. Who was it to be? Mr Darcy or Mr Wickham? Mr Jones or Master Blifil? Gentleman, half-gent or scoundrel? Jane Austen's neighbourhood permitted a fairly decent stretch of the term. Gentlemanliness was almost a profession, and training began early. Lord Chesterfield's letters (published 1774) to his illegitimate son, Philip Stan- hope, instructed the boy in a profession which might provide him with a living. As by law filius nullius [son of nobody], young Philip would need to master the hauteur by which gentlemen were known, but, at the centre of Chesterfield's advice, was a recognition of the difference between who you are and who you appear to be - 'volto sciolto e pensieri stretti', 'that is, a frank open and ingenious exterior, with a prudent and reserved interior'. Some ten years before, Judge Blackstone had started publishing his Com- mentaries for the instruction of 'young gentlemen'. Bentham noted ironi- cally that Blackstone had taught jurisprudence how to improve its manners.'1 Lord Chesterfield's advice caught a rising market of those intent on the arts of ambition. In 1833, one year after the Reform Act and in a society which seemed more attracted to Bentham than to Chesterfield, aristocratic apologists looked for new ways of leading the nation. Bulwer Lytton knew the value of performance. It was in the subtler arts of fashion, taste, manners and bearing, he opined, that the aristocracy could conceal their recent defeats: only gentlemen could hold the new commercial pluralism together; only their style could continue to command. And, for a time, their style did command, though not without a response from below. With what it saw as excessive wealth and insolence at the top, and increasing proletarianization at the bottom, Chartism can be seen mainly as a response to widening social divisions.12 'Snob' emerged in public discourse as the term for those who would be gentlemen but who so obviously and so painfully were not. Thackeray made sport of snobbery, a parvenu culture which poured its poison down from the House of Lords ('consider how difficult it is for the Snob's ideal not to be a snob') through all the layers of the national imagination from City bankers</page><page sequence="8">104 History Workshop Journal at the top to Irish snobs at the bottom.13 Thackeray, with Carlyle, saw all this 'Lord-olatry' in the 1840s as a crisis of statecraft - an unstable condition which was only resolved by the reformed public schools and their imitators from the 1860s. The public schools trained rich young men in masculinity and new ways of applying it. Robert Graves never said goodbye to all that. Throughout his life he knew the value of performance: he was, he said, 'always able, when dealing with officials, or getting privileges from public institutions which grudged them, to masquerade as a gentleman'. Cultural capital has to be performed, or it is nothing.14 Whether by training or by imitation, the gentleman was a performer. Either way, in order to impress, he had to conceal. Speech was the first give- away. The English language became a minefield of 'dos' and 'don'ts' and the true performer knew both lexicons. Modern gentlemen knew how to be everything Le Bon's Crowd (1896)15 was not, and yet, the aspirant had to recognize the crowd in order to appear to be different from it. English theatre thrived on such character skills. In the classical tradition, the power to hold back something extra as a means of projecting something more - a secret, therefore, open and closed at the same time - was a hallmark of the great actor. Noel Coward, Terence Rattigan and Harold Pinter built it into their dramas. P. G. Wodehouse's Jeeves and Wooster were the dignified and efficient parts trying to act as a team. And when the gentleman was homo- sexual, the margin between concealment and projection was all the more nuanced, all the more familiar, all the more English? 2 That the efficient secret was not so new, and that the dignified performance which screened it was not so old - much of it had to be invented - is not the point. The point is that the nation generally accepted the plot while English liberalism, built on the myth of parliamentary gentlemen and their destiny to free the people, provided the grand national story. All those great men who had struck blows for English freedom against a dynastic state were 'liberals' in history if not in fact.16 Simon De Montfort, Sir John Hampden, Oliver Cromwell and William of Orange were not bourgeois 'gentlemen' but they had acted as if they were. Nor were members of workingmen's clubs, but they too were encouraged to act as if they were.17 Bagehot's gen- tlemanly constitution accommodated everyone in an English present, just as liberal histories accounted for (almost) everyone in an English past. This political culture18 reached its zenith from about the 1870s to the 1950s. During that period, not only was there comparative stability at home, strong enough to democratize the electorate, manage a social revolution and win two shattering wars, but there was also the retention, and indeed the extension and then the ceding, of an Empire. Right down to 1945 and for a while after that, the British were represented as having mixed politi- cal contradictions with unique success: power with liberty, modernity with</page><page sequence="9">The Constitution of the English 105 tradition, democracy with aristocracy. They seemed to have changed, yet stayed the same. A public discourse of ancient and imperial destiny flour- ished alongside a national 'character' perceived as ever more ordinary, or 'modern'. As Alison Light has said, what this ordinariness signified 'psy- chologically, emotionally, personally' had 'finally to remain hidden', but no one doubted that it was abidingly middle-class.19 Middle-class lives were supposedly private just as their power was sup- posedly secret. In 1933 the Oxford Union declared that it would not fight unwittingly for 'King and Country' but this was trivial, one of very few public rebukes to the dignified part by the efficient part (of the Oxford Union, some would disagree). Anyway, the motion was loaded against the proposition. By 1933 'King and Country' was unfashionable, a language redolent of the last war and unlikely tQ appeal to middle-class undergradu- ates who were the most ardent advocates of modern ordinariness.20 During the inter war years, the alternative idea of a 'Royal Family' gained in popu- larity but it did so on middle-class terms. When the next war did come, it was clearly a people's war fought with the weapons of domesticity, practi- cality and understatement, by now happily translated as aristocratic virtues too. Throughout the first half of the twentieth century it is possible to inter- pret English national identity as being built (with the harrowing exception of Ireland), on dignified and efficient principles. The traditions of an ancient realm were held aloft to signify Englishness to the world, while behind all that it was understood that modern men ran the business. In fact, this efficient secret was the world's worst-kept secret. Few discourses on the British made reference to the dignity without equal reference to the efficiency which underpinned it. When American troops arrived in numbers from 1943, they had to be drilled in understanding the paradoxes of this ancient yet modern state. GIs were warned not to be misled by appearances. On the outside, the English were formal and reticent; on the inside 'they can be plenty tough'. In government, 'the important thing to remember is that within this apparently old fashioned framework the British enjoy a practical, working twentieth-century democracy'.21 Hitler's war forced the secret into the open. If they were to survive, then the efficient had to step forward and be seen to step forward, while the others had to change or step back - Colonel Blimp included.22 As the Prime Minister said, this was a war of ordinary people, not princes, and of course Churchill was superb at pretending to be both. In 1945, this very peculiar Englishness enjoyed its finest hour: there had been no breach in national history; all classes had come to accept the inevitability of each other; freedom had been upheld and the constitution, the political force field which held all this Englishness together, had been naturalized. Constitutionalists celebrated the naturalness of the English and their constitution. From Saxon seedlings planted with Alfred, or from the first use of the English language in Parliament, or from the settlement of 1688,</page><page sequence="10">106 History Workshop Journal it was said that the English and their constitution had been free to grow, and to grow as one. Dicey in 1885 saw the constitution as the fruit of instinct, 'much as bees construct a honeycomb'; Adams in 1920 praised its 'con- tinuous growth ... from generation to generation'; Amos in 1934 saw it as 'something like the human body'; Shears in 1937 declared it as 'not the invention of any one man but the natural growth among a free people'. Such naturalness had been contrasted with the 'Nazi machine' but in 1944 Butter- field was prepared to go one step further. The English constitution, the constitution of the English, was not like a natural feature, it was a natural feature - together with the landscape, morning mists and country lanes. The English in 1944 were said to be at one with their past and present and with their dignified and efficient selves. They did not need written constitutions to prove it. This is what conservatives meant when they said that in their politics they were not political. Because many English institutions have century upon century of the past, lying fold upon fold within them ... they possess . . . something like the life of organic creatures; they show therefore greater elasticity in the face of those crises which are beyond prediction than do the paper-construc- tions of yesterday.23 As for the English people themselves, the only way to understand them was to get as close to the earth as possible: in this case less than an inch. Ernest Barker's 1947 compilation, The Character of England, starts: Here, close beneath the eye of the man who lies on the downs, is the hair fine grass, dull olive in colour and cropped short by the sheep; among it a few dwarfish violets and the vivid yellow coins of rock roses whose recumbent stems twine between the roots.24 These celebrations went way beyond any narrow understanding of poli- tics. For the economy, a school of historians came to criticize the consti- tutional virtues as inimical to British business success.25 They argued that conventionality, over-practicality and the desire for continuity had stunted enterprise. They saw relative political success as the price paid for relative economic failure. On the other hand, if they were right, or even partially right, their indictment served only to demonstrate the point that constitu- tionalism went deep in the national culture. Something of its cultural force can be seen, for example, in the reconsti- tution of cricket as 'the national game'. Before the reforms of 1865-68, cricket was a game entirely owned, but not entirely played, by aristocrats. The Marylebone County Cricket Club, founded in 1787, controlled what little controlling there was. In 1865, professional cricketers began to chal- lenge the MCC's aristocratic stewardship in much the same way that middle and working-class movements were challenging a Parliament dominated by</page><page sequence="11">The Constitution of the English 107 landowners. The outcomes were similar. The MCC continued to regulate the game and initiate reform through its county club constituencies, with a county championship instituted in 1873, but the dignified part of cricket remained aristocratically amateur even if its best and most efficient players, 'though not of the lowest class, nor of an unrespectable class', remained pro- fessional. Because cricket was played by all classes, and because the best teams accommodated both amateurs and professionals alike, in a properly constituted way, it was the national game. Football was merely popular, largely amongst one class, with professionals and their own sections. In cricket, as in English society generally, vigorous class distinctions between dignified amateurs and efficient players remained. They may have all played for the same club or country but their facilities, their travel arrangements, their divisions of labour and even their names on the scoreboard, were determined by status. Nevertheless, the game held together and prospered. Once cricket's rules were re-established, it was an 'open society' with much cultural mixing. Professionalism influenced amateurism just as amateurism influenced professionalism. Amateur players practised far more than they let on and were not unmindful of the business opportunities which cricket provided. Professionals like Hobbs, Sutcliffe, Hutton and Compton, mean- while, were great and efficient players but had no difficulty taking on the more dignified codes of another time and place (neither their own). As cricket's historian has said, the new constitution 'allowed the aristocracy to tap a rich vein of middle class energy and talent, and to forestall much of the envy.'26 In the colonies, too, constitutionalism seemed to work. At Queen's Royal College, Trinidad, 'we lived in two worlds': the efficient world of taking wickets and scoring runs, and the dignified world of obeying the umpire, lifting team spirit, and upholding the gentlemanly facade - 'we kept a stiff upper lip', 'Eton and Harrow had nothing on us'.27 C. L. R. James celebrated W. G. Grace as a man as great as Matthew Arnold or Thomas Hughes, in that he, like them, had taught a barbarian aristocracy how to live according to the civilizing values of sweetness and light, values which found true form on the field of play. That James was a Marxist, a cricketer and a formidable black intellectual, tells us something about the power of the English and their constitution. And just as the constitution was always more than a political arrangement, so cricket was always more than a game. English schoolboys were taught that a 'straight bat' was more than a way of playing the ball and that 'playing the game' meant more than the game itself. James was not the only writer who charged cricket with a meaning beyond bat and ball. If James could see Marxist strategy in a Test Match, Neville Cardus could find music, John Arlott poetry, and Brian Johnson the beauty of an English summer.28 Middle-class ways grew to be synonymous with Englishness itself. Lewis and Maude could boast, in 1949, that unlike their European counterparts the English middle class had learned how to be 'wholly national' at an early stage</page><page sequence="12">108 History Workshop Journal in their development. To their question 'what shall we do to be received?' the answer had been, 'learn to behave like gentlemen!'29 As gentlemen, the middle class had to unlearn their role as a sectional interest group and learn how to stand for the nation entire. By so doing, their revolution could be concealed through those enduring middle-class qualities of self-effacement, understatement, convention and a stifling 'privacy' some would see as secrecy. During the 1940s the little magazine Men Only - compact enough to be concealed in an inside jacket pocket - carried its female nudes and its occasionally risky stories to feed the hidden fantasies of office workers who, though fond of brushed scalps and correct appearances (according to the advertisements), nevertheless also wanted to know how to behave in ven- turous worlds they could never seriously have been expected to enter. If this was cultural capital, it was contraband. How to be light-hearted and amusing? Where to eat in late night Paris? Where to take mescaline if, per- chance, one should find oneself free with a woman in late afternoon Vienna?30 Such contraband, in turn, fed the quintessentially English James Bond stories from Casino Royale in 1953, stories about a man who, on the inside, shared his readers' petty suburban fantasies. On Her Majesty's secret service, Bond swallowed his English 'phlegm'. In him, reticence went up- market. Later reactions to these male qualities would be much more critical, not to say vulgar. The punks did not hide their difference in a jacket pocket. 'God Save The Queen' was the fascist regime and the best thing to do with phlegm was to get someone else to swallow it for you.31 By this time, the old constitutional qualities were fading fast. But back in 1923 Blackpool Corporation had been so confident of those qualities it had inaugurated a Carnival which had dared to invite its own subversion. The Carnival was abandoned the following year when working-class rowdies turned up from Manchester. In 1940, the constitutional qualities were about to enjoy their high point, although they didn't know it yet. A famous social history of the interwar period, published in that year, pronounced on the culture of the proletarian low-brows making fools of themselves syncopating to twentieth-century 'Negro-Jewish-American' musical importations, the aristocratic high-brows cavorting and flaunting as they had always done, and the sensible middle-class 'mezzo brows' preferring to stay indoors and play inscrutable games like Mah Jong and Contract Bridge.32 3 A sensible ruling class kept their cards hidden. Over the British state lay a thick blanket of secrecy. The Official Secrets Act was passed in 1889 and amended in 1911. Quite extraordinarily in English jurisprudence, emphasis was placed on defence rather than on prosecution. Under section one of the Act it was not necessary for the prosecution to demonstrate guilt of 'any particular act of conspiracy'. Instead, a conviction could be gained from 'circumstances ... or his conduct, or his known character'. Section two was</page><page sequence="13">The Constitution of the English 109 designed to shut-up civil servants and keep out journalists. All state infor- mation was secret. Ministers were the sole arbiters of information. All com- munication - 'the sketch, plan, model, article, note, document or information' - was unlawful. The sender of it as well as the receiver was guilty 'unless he proves that the communication ... was contrary to his desire'.33 The Official Secrets Act gagged tens of thousands of civil servants. 'Notable for its extreme width', over two thousand differently worded charges were possible. In 1971 the Franks Committee was set up to look at section two. In spite of the Committee's damning indictment, nothing was changed and the Act remains on the statute book, more or less intact. Refer- ring to the debates of 1911, Franks reported that they ... give a clear impression of crisis of legislation aimed mainly at es- pionage. Closer study, and reference to official sources reveal a different story. This legislation had been long desired by governments. It had been carefully prepared over a period of years. One of its objects was to give greater protection against leakages of any kind of official information whether or not connected with defence of national security ... Parlia- ment was not given full explanations of the 1911 Bill.34 It would appear that the efficient secret was in full working order. It would appear also that by 1911 the House of Commons itself was well underway to becoming a mainly dignified part. Secrecy was central to the practice of government. It didn't take the Soviets long to realise that the British state offered a fine training in subterfuge.35 NKVD strategy from the 1920s tar- geted potentially senior figures likely to work as double agents. Recruited at university, the plan was for these 'moles' to lie low until, once in impor- tant positions of state, they could be activated. The NKVD and KGB had recognised the uses of concealment and were recruiting graduates long before the home intelligence services. The constitution itself is a shadowy affair. There is no such item as a single written 'Constitution'. It is written, but in many forms over many cen- turies, and it is not only written but practised and interpreted in ways which cannot be measured except against a host of other practices, interpretations, judgements, rules, codes, conventions and regulations which structure the practice and the principle of British central power defended at every point by an Official Secrets Act which tries to hide the state from the nation. For this is a form of words which is not definitive and which 'we have to piece ... together [for] ourselves'.36 By 'ourselves' can only mean those in a position to do so, unofficially and usually in secret. As Dicey averred, behind all the shams there lay one true source of power which was the absolute sovereignty of Parliament. Govern- ment ministers were both the source and the arbiters of their own consti- tution. Dicey echoed Gladstone, and no end of constitutionalists have since echoed Dicey in his opinion that 'no constitution can work better than it is</page><page sequence="14">110 History Workshop Journal made to work by those to whom it gives power'.37 These people frame and pass legislation as part of the constitution. From the parent legislation stems delegated legislation, some ninety per cent of the whole, which comprises the rules and regulations necessary to enact the law. When practised long enough, these rules and regulations can themselves become 'conventions'. Conventions control the key relationships between monarch and ministers, Parliament and the Civil Service. Gieatest of all these conventions has been the monarchy itself which is there because it has been there long enough. Some put its crowns and baubles in the same category.38 The dignified part deems that sovereignty rests with the monarch but the convention is that she does what she is told because (as far as we can tell) she has always done so. As Jennings explained in 1954: the Queen is a name who has a function, and only has a function because she is a name.39 Piecing it together for ourselves then, is like a jigsaw where the pieces change in size and shape according to the understandings and intentions of those who play. A very unpredictable game therefore, and one not much played by outsiders although outsiders masquerading as insiders have proved to be its best friends and cheeriest critics.40 Indeed, to be in search of the constitution is a genre known to English political history as much as into unknown England is known to English social history. As for the insiders, they have made the constitution be more or less whatever they have wanted it to be, whenever they have wanted it to be so. There is something of a tautology here and it stems most famously from Burke, who was very clear that the best constitutions took a long time to form and, over time, came to resemble the mind of the nation they were intended to serve. Such constitutions, like the English one, which was exemplary, were 'made by what is ten thousand times better than choice . . . by the peculiar circumstances, occasions, tempers, dispositions and moral, civil and social habitudes of the people, which disclose themselves only in a long space of time'. They became like 'a vestment, which accommodates itself to the body'. The question here is who decides what this 'body' is? The answer is that, for the most part, the decisions have been made by historians and lawyers who were and are themselves constitutionalists. They believed in Burke and the Common-Law tradition from which he drew, and inter- preted the people, and, quite astonishingly, found that the English people fitted the English constitution. And because these things were deemed to have happened naturally, then everything the English mind was, or had been, and nearly everything their constitution was, or had been, must fit. Thus, for Jennings, liberty was 'the consequence of an attitude of mind rather than precise values'. For Amos, the English mind was at one with the constitution, 'or what is felt to be the constitution'. Freeman's Growth of the English Constitution (1890) made this plain from the earliest times. The constitution had been all things to all Englishmen. It was monarchical, yet 'republican' too because English monarchs were not like other monarchs. It included an aristocracy that was not a nobility because English aristocrats</page><page sequence="15">The Constitution of the English 111 desired no special privileges, and had allowed democracy. It loved the law, yet kept the basis of that law vague. It prized conventions, but liked not to scrutinize them too much. It enjoyed high principles, though none which any judge would recognize. In a constitution as fluid as this, real republican questions could hardly be framed, yet alone posed. Above all, the consti- tution promoted the open freedom of freeborn men, yet could still insist on operating by stealth. Freeman wanted it all ways, and in both directions, for all time: 'We have not gone back but have gone forward . . . we have gone forward by going back'.41 As well as near total freedom of verbal manoeuvre, the constitution has allowed also for an element of pure fiction. What it does does not always correspond to what it is, but the fictions are maintained all the same. With so much parliamentary business conducted through private understandings, the normal channels and behind the Speaker's chair, procedures change, but stealthily, until the insider dealings last long enough to become conventions. How long 'long enough' is, rather depends on the freedom for verbal manoeuvre. As Gordon described it in 1952, the constitution 'connected outward sameness' with 'hidden inner change'.42 4 Of all the open and closed secrets which this constitution generated, none is more instructive than that the two defining parliaments on which the current Parliament is based, were themselves unlawful. Dicey, Maitland, Adams, Keir and Alder all agree on this.43 Sovereignty is what makes every- thing legal. Sovereignty in Britain rests with the Crown but it also rests with Parliament, or, with that piece of verbal manoeuvring, the 'Crown-in-Parlia- ment'. The constitution, therefore has its being through a holy trinity of Sovereignty, a three-in-one version of legality - Crown, Parliament, and Crown-in-Parliament. The parliaments of 1660 and 1688 - one which invited a Stuart king to return and the other which invited a Stuart king to leave - under two out of the three versions of sovereignty (Crown, and 'Crown-in- Parliament'), had no legal right to do what they did. The right to make the law therefore, in English constitutional history at least, seems to have rested only with those who enjoyed the right to break it. This is the heart of the matter. To understand this is to understand the constitution of the English. The tremendous concentration of parliamentary power, arraigned in Cabinet and wielded by the Prime Minister, derives from the former concen- tration of monarchical power. This derivation constitutionalists have both acknowledged and concealed, as it has suited them. Dicey wanted to estab- lish first principles of power. Dicey's first, first principle was the absolute sov- ereignty of Parliament, which ... means neither more nor less than this, that Parliament thus defined has, under the English constitution, the right to make or unmake any law</page><page sequence="16">112 History Workshop Journal whatever; and, further that no person or body is recognised by the law of England as having the right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.44 Principles, however, were one thing, workings were another. It was clear to Dicey that if in practice parliamentary despotism was to be avoided, there had to be a check on excesses. Only the courts could decide what an excess was, and check it in the public interest when it occurred. At this point of challenge, Dicey's first principle of parliamentary sovereignty and his second principle of the rule of law ran smack into his third principle of con- vention. For there is a sense in which, in practice, convention could muddle parliament and law. Convention is the virus through which that culture of concealment and obscurity has found its way into the heart of the English and their constitution. As the personal will of the monarch was transformed over the years into the law of Parliament, that transformation was based upon the 'constant use of fictions', 'the invention of lawyers'.45 Royal prerogatives, therefore, became parliamentary prerogatives exercised as insider understandings otherwise known as conventions. Conventions can be made or broken in a minute. Although it is not normally possible to be sure who makes them, it is clear that ministers acting in conjunction with very senior civil servants - especially the cabinet secretary, the Prime Min- ister's principal private secretary and the monarch's private secretary - have had the major say in activating those conventions we know about. A former second permanent secretary to the cabinet office referred in 1995 to 'that very narrow range where knowledge meets power', about thirty five to forty people, and how the civil servants among them adjust knowledge to power 'through their finger tips ... through their pores'. Whoever advises, and whosever decides, conventions are fundamental to how power is used.46 Since the eighteenth century their use has been probably mainly parlia- mentary, but it has also been obscure, changeful and concealed behind a lot of untruths about the sovereignty of the Sovereign.47 As such, it is very diffi- cult for judges to make judgement about whether an 'excess' has or has not occurred. If a prerogative is of no fixed type or origin, or if a convention is incapable of definition and can be changed in a moment, how can reason- able judgement be made whether ministers have or have not exceeded their jurisdiction? The process of legal testing for excesses is called judicial review. Between state and review, there has been a real struggle for final say as to what is lawful and not lawful. Normally, neither the politicians nor the courts are desirous of testing their powers against each other. But when driven hard enough, the state can invoke 'national security' or 'public interest' in defence of its prerogative powers and try to gain immunity by blocking or hampering a judicial review. This is a very serious action because, as Mait- land said, royal immunity is coupled with ministerial responsibility.48 When judicial review is blocked or hampered, the people are denied their only</page><page sequence="17">The Constitution of the English 113 external check on ministers acting beyond their powers. And when the public are denied access to information on grounds of 'public interest immunity', then the internally circuitous nature of state power is complete. The Scott Report, published in February 1996, chanced upon how this works in detail. Here was an instance of judicial review in the form of an inquiry inaugurated by the government. Lord Justice Scott's five-volume report provided a unique insight into how difficult it is for outsiders - even government commissioned outsiders like him - to check excesses within the state. For Scott showed something far more than excesses perpetrated by rogue ministers. It showed a system that was habitually used to doing as it wished. In the first place, there was an Act passed in 1939 which gave the Board of Trade total powers to control the import and export of military equipment. The precedent for this Act derived from royal prerogative in time of war but the 1939 Act remained on the statute book after the war and, out of its customary use, grew the 'convention' that no information relating to the selling of defence equipment could be made public. Thus, at the outset, we have the classic sequence, first, the grounds of public interest and national security; second, royal prerogative; third, a parliamentary Act of near total control; and fourth, a convention of concealment in the name of all the aforementioned. In December 1984 the government drew up a set of internal guidelines intended to increase arms sales to Iraq and Iran. Here, the fifth part of the sequence, that of verbal manoeuvre, came into play. Government policy towards the two countries in question was verbalized as 'neutral', or 'impersonal', or 'even-handed' depending on interpretation and adjustment for differences in balance. The government guidelines designed to increase sales referred to 'defence equipment' and included both lethal equipment (guideline i) and non lethal equipment (guideline iii), in such a way that the export of industrial 'dual use' goods could be left open to what Lord Howe, the author of the guidelines, called a modicum of flexi- bility. Whether or not Howe's guidelines represented government policy or just an aspect of the management of the policy was also open to verbal manoeuvre. Then, early in 1989, under changed circumstances, junior min- isters from three ministries decided that in the case of Iraq the flexibility should be made more flexible still. At this point, the word-play increased in range and exuberance. The government did not want Parliament or the public to know that the guidelines had been changed. Until Scott's inquiry, they contented them- selves with semantics. With Scott's inquiry, they tried to conceal their deeds in a miasma of words: guideline (iii) had been 'relaxed' (or its interpretation had been relaxed), or 'amended', or 'handled' differently, or 'modified', or made more 'flexible' or, in the words of William Waldegrave (previously the minister responsible for open government) 'this meant in practice that both groups used the suggested revised form of guideline (iii) as an in- terpretative gloss on the original guideline'. Word-play of such style was obviously worth imitating. Justice Scott called government responses to</page><page sequence="18">114 History Workshop Journal parliamentary questions about the change 'designedly uninformative'. Whether some ministers had acted with 'duplicitous intention' is not very important, even though they had. What is far more important from the wider point of view of the English and their constitution is that the system is authoritarian and is allowed to remain authoritarian because it is both concealed in how it thinks and flexible in how it thinks about how it thinks. E. M. Forster once referred to this practice as 'the dictator spirit working away behind the facade of government forms'.49 The power of the 'Crown-in-Parliament' has no legal or practical limit but that power in turn determines the limit of all other authorities, includ- ing the courts. Those who live under the system, and those who deal with it, must remember this: the constitution allows near absolute power to any group who can maintain a majority in the House of Commons. They are the state and the state is the nation. Insofar as they are secure, they say the nation is secure. Insofar as they are settled, they say the nation is settled. For a long time, national history was constitutional history. Times editori- als in the 1970s could still pity the poor benighted Irish as a people who could not make their 'settlement' as Englishmen had done nearly three hundred years before.50 Yet this settlement, like the constitution itself, is a virtual settlement. It depends not on reality but on ways of interpreting reality, ways dominated by insiders. The constitution of the English only becomes apparent by acts of looking. Even criticism is acceptable if who does the criticizing is 'one of us'. When there are few legal or procedural counterweights to power, everything comes to depend on persons. 5 In his Rights of Man Tom Paine cut through the flummery. He agreed with Burke that government was nothing more than 'a contrivance of human wisdom' to meet human wants, but he recognized also that what those wants were, were decided only by those in power. That and only that could explain the continued existence of monarchs who could have no possible role except to hide the actual practice of power, which lay elsewhere. If there was no constitution which could be pointed at, then, for Tom Paine, there was no constitution. Anything less than that was a 'pantomimical contrivance, and change of scene and character' where 'one member says, This is Consti- tution; and another says, That is Constitution - today it is one thing; and tomorrow it is something else'.51 So unanswerable was Paine's analysis in 1792 that, in a rational world, the English constitution should have sunk without trace. That it did not do so but lived to reinvent itself and enjoy its most lustrous years tells us some- thing not only about rational worlds but also about the persistence of those conservative wisdoms which Paine's rationality so refuted but so equally failed to damage. The constitution today persists as an instrument as well as an ideology of rule. The wonder is not that it fails to tell the truth, but</page><page sequence="19">The Constitution of the English 115 that its fictions have been tolerated for so long.52 Those who have found the lies intolerable have been advised to suspend their disbelief and venerate 'without undergoing the degradation of understanding . . .'53 A recent ven- erator offers a few ideas for reform, on one thing and something else, but acknowledges still that the constitution relies on the personalities of those who work it.54 Books on nationalism emphasise the 'personality' of nations. The mark of the old aristocracies had been their reliance on loyalties cast as 'personal, emotional, uncalculating'.55 For the British new aristocracy operating after 1867, the personal was their mark too. What was dignified was for the dig- nified and what was efficient was for the efficient but what was for all, in the national personality, rested on dignifying the efficiency of the quiet men, the secret men, the backroom men - the practical men who pieced it all together. In effect, there was no operational difference between dignified and efficient parts of the constitution, because the personality of the men who ran it was celebrated as a combination of both parts. Leave it all to them, for were they not the ones from whom sprang the nation's brains, leadership and organising abilities? The English people have been invited to trust a personality not a constitution. Look into the mirror of Bagehot's constitution and see the reflection of Renier's and Plamenatz's middle-class Englishman. Like him it was understated, that is, unwritten, untheoretical, not explicit. Like him, it was practical, that is, capable of adaptation, and effective. Like him, it was conventional, that is, habitual, unthinking, screen- ing the articulate truth behind a set of codes. Most important of all, like him, it could be what it wanted to be. All the great constitutionalists defended the constitution as a personality, and insisted on its superiority over that which was artificial, legalistic, abstract (or French).56 There was nothing ancien about the regime of personality. In the twentieth century it may even have grown in importance as politics has become bigger, less direct, more intangible and distant: 'the state functions more easily if it can be personi- fied'.57 The characteristic life of Englishmen was held to conform to the personal codes. The nineteenth-century revival of chivalry in public schools, uni- versities, sporting clubs, boys' organizations and various forms of public service did much to reconstitute who men were and how men should behave.58 Honour was always revered as a personal relationship, even when its function was knowingly ideological. Honour was also, by definition, self effacing. It had to conceal in order to project. Gentlemen farmers, gentle- men magistrates, gentlemen cricketers, gentlemen schoolmasters, gentle- men's gentlemen, officers and gentlemen were all expected to go beyond the business in hand, but not necessarily in ways you could tell: 'A gentle- man ... is a thing of parts and no magnitude: one should be a gentleman, and much more'.59 In military service and sport these same personal, yet highly codified relationships were connected. No end of manly literature celebrated the link between character for football and cricket and character</page><page sequence="20">116 History Workshop Journal for war. At the Somme, the British Army suffered 419,654 casualties and some of the first wave had been led by officers who hoisted footballs high across no-man's land. Second Lieutenants, lowest and most boyish rank of the British officer corps, suffered the highest rate of front-line casualties. There is evidence that these 'nicely raised young men' managed, against the odds, to be honoured by their platoons, 'face to face with forty Durham miners, Yorkshire furnacemen, Clydeside riveters'.60 There is evidence too that when the war turned out to be hell and not a gallop into gallantry, soldiers further refined those characteristic English concealments of irony and understatement. Euphemisms abounded. 'Shell Shock' for mental illness, 'brisk fighting' for awful slaughter, 'battles' for months in the killing fields of France and Flanders, were all part of a certain gentlemanly per- sonality. With euphemism went irony, and while 'rather', 'quite', and 'some- what' diminished the superlatives somewhat, understatement controlled the truth. Siegfried Sassoon remembered his performance. Lying wounded in hospital he was decently self-effacing to senior officers, nicely diffident for the sisters of brother officers, and brutally truthful to non-combatants.61 In the history of national personalities, and particularly so in the English case, the idea of an aristocracy has always played a leading part. Since the 1930s however, the English aristocracy have moved away from the national- political to the national-cultural. It is, for example, something of an achieve- ment that their great country houses, built for private indulgence, have become national treasures. Only the aristocracy were powerful enough to make their stately homes in the image of an England as they imagined it to be. Sitting perfectly in the landscape, their houses looked like acts of nature, while their relationships with loyal retinues of staff and tenants provided them with natural models of government. And yet, these houses were defined as belonging 'to everybody', 'or at least everybody who cares about this country and its traditions'.62 Alongside this identification of national personality with the men who practised the constitution, there is also a clearly understood sense in which national personality shifts with changes in its constitution. Constitutional institutions are of the definining kind. It used to be Neal Ascherson's jibe that only the dignified part had been efficient. Few could claim that now. In their retreat into the 'heritage' wing of national culture, trailing their lordly mansions behind them, the aristocracy have in fact retreated from the politi- cal show. Aristocrats both old and new are now simply the rich among the rich, mingling bourgeois and aristocratic interests as they have always done, but without the duty and now almost without the ceremonial.63 This aristo- cratic evacuation has left the monarchy hopelessly isolated. Left to carry the constitutional can, Royalty is now almost a court without courtiers. Prince Charles, severely schooled in his duties from birth, did not find in his wife someone who would carry out her performance as he envisaged it. Princess Diana's insistence that a special role should be found for her - married or not - was entirely proper. One learns never to say never with the English</page><page sequence="21">The Constitution of the English 117 constitution.64 The Princess did just what most other constitutionalists have done - she made it up as she went along. This is why historians have vied with lawyers as constitutional experts, this is why King Charles III might well find himself with a new constitutional device enthroned alongside him when his time comes. No doubt old precedents will be found in the attic. Meanwhile the efficient part was eighteen years in the hands of a govern- ment which was ready to show its own naked power with or without (it never seemed to care) a dignified accompaniment. Because it could only carry out its programme from the top, Thatcherism retained those enor- mous powers under the constitution.65 Reform of the central state was out of the question. It did, however, want to change the old way of doing old boys' business through the clubs and networks. It saw this business as a cor- porate conspiracy of failed politicians, businessmen and civil servants. Most importantly, Thatcherism sought to de-legitimize those state institutions which it did not trust. The government ceased to rely on its own MPs and civil servants. Executive thinking was privatized. A dozen right-wing think tanks became the main conduits of public opinion and new ideas. Here, and contrary to traditional conservative wisdoms, policy-making was exposed to dogma and reason rather than to circumstance and experience. De-legit- imization exposed the tremendous concentration of power around the Prime Minister's office for what it was.66 Middle-class shibboleths - the sanctity of the professions, the place of the monarchy, the reputation of the Church of England, the chartered independence of the universities, the civic standing of local government, the modest securities of Middle England - were ignored or, if they stood in the way, attacked. Government claimed 'an impossible omnicompetence'.67 At the heart of Mrs Thatcher's project was marketization and privatiza- tion. With her, the sovereignty of the state was matched, in rhetoric at least, by the sovereignty of capital, a constitutional link Bagehot himself had recognized.68 The power and reach of capitalist corporations was enhanced and no one expected any sentiment from them about solidarity in nations. Markets are no respecters of tradition either. Given their head in a global economy of GATT agreements, a European economy pledged to free trade, a British economy recently relieved of its traditional cultural and social restraint, they were bound to reduce government policy to power play. In its encouragement of 'market forces', Thatcherism not only weakened those intermediate institutions wherein its own middle-class constituency had once found its quiet dignity, it also glorified the efficient path as both the instrument and the object of its rule. A politics so embedded in what it was to be constitutionally English that it was hardly seen as politics at all, that is, politics as intelligent Conservatives had long espoused it, as conventional, looked doomed.69 This, together with the dismantling of the welfare state and the canvassing of private forms of social life, with no sense of public virtue or regard, overwhelmed the old constitutionalism, its public-service myths and the duties and standards they set.</page><page sequence="22">118 History Workshop Journal In 1994 the Committee of Public Accounts had to go back 140 years to remind itself of the myths and standards of the old constitutionalism. It reflected on The Proper Conduct of Public Business thus - In recent years we have seen and reported on a number of serious fail- ures in administrative and financial systems and controls within depart- ments and other public bodies, which have led to money being wasted or otherwise improperly spent. These failings represent a departure from the standards of public conduct which have mainly been established ... following the publication of the Northcote and Trevelyan Report which condemned the nepotism, the incompetence and other defects of the Civil Service. It is from that period that we acquired the principles and the standards which have come to be copied by some countries and admired by many more. It is our task to retain those standards.70 At the same time, it was a long while since the middle classes had been sub- jected to the same market risks which the working class had always known. It was a long time too since it had been acceptable for middle-class Eng- lishmen to admit that they were in it for the money. Traders on the stock exchange gave up on the idea that their word was their bond. They started to deal with tape recorders switched on. Managerialism confounded their Englishness, but they did it just the same. Understatement, pragmatism, reserve, conventionality could no longer be the qualities of the managerial- ist curriculum vitae. Selling was the name of the game, and first article was oneself. Profiles must be high, mission statements must be explicit, pro- cedures must be rational, psychometric testing must be testing and conven- tions must be turned and turned again. Efficiency was all, though some companies did try to sell themselves as quintessentially British, capable of blending managerial efficiency with historic dignity - 'at a time when so many countries are abandoning traditional values in favour of mass pro- duction'.71 Manageralists do not require a dignified class to excuse them. In this context, the Nolan Committee, set up in October 1994 to report on stan- dards in public life, provided predictable reading. It was plain that political relationships once founded on personality, the hallmark of a constitution designed to be worked by sound chaps who, up to a point, knew and trusted each other, had suffered serious erosion. One of Nolan's witnesses referred to this as the 'code of the Woosters' which a new generation of parliamen- tarians 'do not know about'. Nolan's committee felt they could not say whether standards in public life had declined. Instead, they pointed to so much change and confusion 'over what is and what is not acceptable behav- iour'. In particular, the state had re-directed a large portion of its adminis- trative business into executive agencies, thus draining some of the old cultural sump wherein members and officials had once learned what the last generation had deemed proper, honourable even. As well, there was an</page><page sequence="23">The Constitution of the English 119 unprecedented level of pressure from the commercial lobbyists - acting on a new political class interested in extra earnings or, at least, inexperienced in how to deal with the pressure. A former permanent secretary told one witness that he approved of the new Code of Ethics for civil servants but added, 'of course, we did not need it in my generation because "we had it inside us"'. Of written codes, Nolan remarked: I suppose up until now it has been assumed, and until recently not ques- tioned, that it was too obvious to need writing down, but we have heard a great deal of evidence from others about the need for codes ... 72 Nolan was a sign of the times. If those insiders dealing in the same codes and understandings were going, or gone, then Nolan's answer was contrac- tual, with a commissioner to apply written rules. Only a handful of parlia- mentarians have demurred. Their argument that real gentlemen could not be codified actually meant that they could not be codified in writing. Either way, their argument had no basis in fact. It was not the 'gentlemen' who had gone but the old ways of identifying them. Needless to say, for even the beginning of the new has to begin with the end of the old, the new com- missioner was known on the inside as a good chap, the perfect mandarin.73 6 On the 10th February 1987, the Right Honourable Alan Clark MP stood in Westminster Abbey at Lord Stockton's memorial service, and reflected on the Conservative Party. Clark, a government minister formerly of Eton, Oxford, the Household Cavalry and a member of the Inner Temple, Brooks' and Pratt's, regretted recent changes in Tory personnel. He disliked the 'nouves', as he called them. He wished that the 'toffs' as he called them, with all their manifold personal qualities, were back. He wished, indeed, that genuine toffs like the late Lord Stockton were back in full command. As the young Harold Macmillan, Stockton had seen war service: The Grenadier's Return was played, and I thought of the fife music, and of the decimated battalion marching back from Hulluch on 26th Sep- tember 1915, past the wounded laid out in rows on either side of the street, groaning from their injuries. And the young classical scholar, less than a year out of Eton, pale and shaken but heroic nonetheless. When Macmillan enlisted Britain was at the very height of her power and dominion. The habitual bearing, stoicism, self sacrifice, sense of fair play: the whole tenu of the English upper class was in place and unquestioned, looked up to and copied everywhere. Now look at us - and them! I looked up at the great circular windows, to which I have raised my eyes at so many services and I thought, I must - when will I - write my great</page><page sequence="24">120 History Workshop Journal work, Tories and the Nation State 1922-74. Perhaps it is for this that I will be remembered? If I am spared.74 Alan Clark's elegiac tones recalled more glorious days. Yet, what he was thinking typified not an aristocracy but a modern constitution designed from the first to mix nouves with toffs' in such a way that, given time, it was impossible to tell one from the other. Clark's father had been a lord but his grandfather had been a Scottish manufacturer of thread. Macmillan's had been a book seller and publisher. Before that, somewhere down the line, both men had sprung from Scottish crofters. How long before a nouve becomes a toff? How long before the qualities of one are recognised as having leaked into the performance of the other? In Macmillan's case, not long. As Prime Minister he had been noted for his sharp style, a man more at ease with the nouves. As Lord Stockton, only in his retirement had Mac- millan assumed the role of ancient aristocrat: 'He was often thought to be a survivor from a previous age, but it was not clear what age it was'.75 In Clark's case, by his pen shall you know him. The nineteenth-century aris- tocratic qualities he thought he was describing in the Abbey were certainly not the qualities of Matthew Arnold's aristocracy: 'Barbarians' Arnold had called them, and stoicism was certainly not to their fore. Nor were genuine toffs much in evidence as great leaders. Gladstone and Peel were both the sons of men who had had to buy their own estates 'bran new'.76 Disraeli's father had bought a mere country house, minus estate, and Disraeli himself had ridden to hounds, once, and that was enough. Out of twelve Tory prime ministers since 1900, only three (Salisbury, Balfour, Home) were genuine toffs in the sense Clark meant it. Up to Macmillan's premiership in 1957, Bonar Law, Baldwin and Chamberlain were all solid commercial bourgeois, with their hands in iron, while Eden was minor gentry with interests in Durham coal. Churchill was the son of the third son of a Duke, but he was not immensely rich, or landed, and never accepted a peerage. Not that any of this matters except to Alan Clark and how he chose to see himself that day in Westminster Abbey. The constitution of the English allows Clark, as it has allowed others like him, to reinvent, to perform like a gentleman, to pass himself off as old new aristocracy or old old bourgeois and conspire to do and to be just as he likes. Clark makes up his own self as he makes up his own history. But will he be spared? The conditions must be right for change. For the Welsh and Scots, it looks as if fundamental constitutional change will happen with an Assembly in Cardiff and a Parliament in Edinburgh. It may even happen for the North- ern Irish, as happen it must if peace is to prevail. But it is the English, all the English - including the women, who have played no part in consti- tutional culture, and black people, who stand outside its history - who now find themselves in the most need of a restatement of who they are and where power lies.77 It may be that the impulse for change will come from the other</page><page sequence="25">The Constitution of the English 121 British nationalities as they learn how to become more demanding partners in the Union. The time is ripe but how will the English know when? Such has been the nature of their recondite constitution, how can they know that a crisis is upon them until they are told it is? They have spent so long being spoken for, being told to hush, that they habitually find themselves waiting for an announcement from those whose interest it is not to announce. Of one thing we can be certain: when Lord St John of Fawsley hands down the news of a deep constitutional crisis, then it must be true. In 1990 Jeremy Paxman published the results of his interviews with 150 members of 'the Establishment'. He concluded that whilst the old new ruling class was now enfeebled, a new new one had yet to emerge.78 In the interregnum expect morbid symptoms to appear. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1.

Marx had spotted these precise developments early. Writing in March 1855 for the Neue-Order-Zeitung, he stated what would be the core of Bagehot's thesis: 'The British Constitution is, in fact, only an antiquated and obsolete compromise made between the bour- geoisie, which rules in actual practice, although not officially, in all the decisive spheres of bourgeois society, and the landed aristocracy, which forms the official government'.

Walter Bagehot, The English Constitution (1867), London, Fontana, 1963, p. 248. Max Weber and Matthew Arnold are worth reading alongside. Weber saw the routinization of 'charisma', through institutions or the depersonalization of office or title, as a way of main- taining a sense of natural authority - 'personal devotion to, and personal authority of, "natural" leaders, in contrast to the appointed leaders of the bureaucratic order ...' Max Weber, in, Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich, eds, Max Weber, Economy and Society, New York, Bedminster Press, 1968, p. 117. Compare Matthew Arnold's view of the middle, or 'philistine', class in Culture and Anarchy (1869) with Bagehot's as quoted in the text: 'Consider these people, then, their way of life, their habits, their manners, the very tones of their voice; look at them attentively ... would any amount of wealth be worth having with the condition that one was to become just like these people by having it?' The charisma of George Eliot's Sir James Chettam, a 'blooming Englishman of the red-whiskered type', relied on masculinity and tradition: 'A man's mind - what there is of it - has always the advantage of being masculine ... [and] ... a Kind Providence furnishes the limpest personality with a little gum or starch in the form of tradition.' Middlemarch, 1872. 5. J. S.

From the start of proper public record keeping in Britain, between 1838 and 1854, the Home Office and the Foreign Office were keen to suppress information in order to preserve past good names and maintain the view of an 'English past ... seen not in terms of a series of conflicts but, in classic Whig terms, as a natural progression of events tending towards ... the peaceful, civilised and prosperous society which was the Britain in which they lived': Philippa Levine, The Amateur and the Professional.

John Gray has noted how the English conservative philosopher, Michael Oakeshott, used the British constitution as the paradigm of political experience. From its practical workings and reliance on the internal understandings of those who work it, Oakeshott derived his theory of knowledge as a distillation of practice, not rational principles: The unfixedness and informality of the British constitution, its rule by convention and precedent, the ubiquity - at least until very recent times - of tacit understandings as to the role of the state in social life, these are singularities of English political experience from which few, if any, general truths about political life can be derived.

Hennessy is very good on all this. He calls his Preface 'A Back-of-the-Envelope Nation' in reference to the speed with which 'conventions' can be brought to life, put to death, or committed to print - among them, Stowe's interlocking circles (1976), the Wheeler-Bennett solecism (1940), 'QPM' (1945), the office of Prime Minister (1878), the Cabinet (1937): Hidden Wiring, p. 17, p. 29, p. 34, p. 90.

Trying to estimate the true extent of monarchical power (influence and prerogative) is to enter a Catch 22 nightmare where questions never get properly answered, never can be properly answered, by those in authority. Thus, there is no clear point at which the sovereign's</page><page sequence="29">The Constitution of the English 125 powers begin, or end, but final responsibility for the integrity of the constitution lies with her - 'it may be suggested'; formally, these powers are enormous and should be able to uphold and defend the constitution, but in practice ministers wield these powers (to an extent which threatens the constitution); it is best that ministers have these powers, or most of them. because by so doing the sovereign. is kept above politics even though all former monarchs made their political views well known and were politically active in the constitution, although it is impossible to say by how much: Vernon Bogdanor, The Monarchy and the Constitution, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1995, chapter three. Very senior civil servants in England are known as 'Mandarins' - high ranking bureaucrats in the Chinese Empire known for their secrecy and inscrutability; in Chinese culture, 'Tao' is that which cannot be admitted, can hardly be thought, is nearly impossible to speak, is certainly impossible to resolve and, though passive, is all the stronger for being believed.

E. M. Forster is quoted in Edward Timms and Peter Collier, Visions and Blueprints, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 1988, p. 117. Scott also investigated the misuse of 'Public Interest Immunity Certificates' by ministers, certificates which seek to hold back certain documents, by prerogative, on national security grounds. The concept of public interest immunity has its origins in the convention of Crown Privilege. In 1947 the Crown Proceedings Act ended Crown immunity from court actions but retained the prerogative of withholding documents in the 'public interest'. Section 10 of the Contempt of Court Act (1981) made courts the arbiters of disclosure or retention of documents, but it remains the case that the state has tried to use public interest immunity against the courts and 'that the courts are never absolutely bound to accept a government claim to immunity, no matter what its basis'. In 1984 and 1985 the House of Lords ruled in favour of government prerogative in two sensitive cases - the banning of trade unions at GCHQ, and the forcing of the Guardian newspaper to disclose its source on the intended siting of nuclear missiles: Smythe and Emery, Review, p . 79, pp. 74-77, pp. 79-80. In the face of these rulings, the Scott report showed how, in spite of intense pressure from government ministers (by signing Public Interest Immunity Certificates), as well as from the prosecuting counsel, Judge Smedley in the Matrix Churchill trial resisted, and disclosed documents to the defence thus saving innocent men from the prospect of imprisonment. Moreover, it seems that the Attorney General persuaded ministers to sign the certificates - one of them very reluctantly - on his interpretation of what sounds like a 'convention'. In a report by Heather Mills, 'PITs' have been used 'by Whitehall and the police to great effect' to an extent of encouraging a 'cavalier' approach, according to Lord Justice Simon Brown, president of the Security Service Tribunal (The Independent, 17 February 1996). Matrix Churchill were a British company involved in the export of defence related goods to Iraq. The disarmament movement saw NATO's nuclear weaponry and the authoritarianism and secrecy which surrounded it as deeply damaging to civil liberties and democratic government. During the 1980s, E. P. Thompson returned as an essayist of the left in full spate against these threat- ening developments. See his Writing by Candlelight, London, Merlin Press, 1980 and The Heavy Dancers, London, Merlin Press, 1985. PIIs are one of the four ways by which the state maintains secrecy. The other three are the Law of Confidentiality, as created in the 1980s to stop the Observer and Guardian newspapers publishing secret service extracts; the Law of Contempt; and the Official Secrets Act. 50.

It is interesting to observe how lesser parts of the constitution change in response to its greater parts. Thus a former Anglican Bishop of Birmingham told the Sunday Times (26 November 1995) that a divorced Prince Charles could indeed ascend to the throne, in spite of the Church's position on the marrying of previously married people; and that the monarch's title as 'Supreme Governor' of the Church of England doesn't mean what it says. 65. 1988, three-hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Rights, was a bad year in this respect, and worse was to follow: Donald Shell, 'The British constitution in 1988', Parlia- mentary Affairs 42, 1989, and the Report of Lord Justice Scott on government activities then and thereafter, vi. 46. 66.

Among the member companies were British Airways, Daks and Land Rover. 72. Nolan, Standards in Public Life, vol. ii, op. cit., p. 498, 2304, on the Woosters and the former permanent secretary, evidence of Prof. Peter Hennessy, p. 370, 1715 and p. 365, 1696. See also Professor Dawn Oliver, p. 498, 2303. For general conclusions on pressures and behav- iours, see Standards in Public Life, vol. i, Report, p. 3 and throughout. Some witnesses in volume ii were sympathetic to Enoch Powell's refusal to disclose his interests, resting instead on his honour, but thought its time was past: vol ii, p. 10, 43; p. 52, 267; p. 59, 311. Lord Blake believed that corruption, or at any rate understandings of acceptability and unacceptability, went in phases: 1860-95, 'very little trouble'; 1895-1930, 'a lot'; 1930-65, 'I do not think you could write an interesting book about British corruption'; 1965-, new phase (p. 13). There might have been insider codes and they might have been seen as decent, gentlemanly even, but it is as well to remember that in the 1950s Hayek worried about the delegation of power from one set of gentlemen, the law-makers, to another set, the administrators who were, 'in effect, given power to wield coercion without rule'. He perceived little difference between socialists and Conservatives on this matter and saw it as a growing loss of liberty to gentlemen who mistakenly claimed to know best: F. A. Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty (1960), London, Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1976, p. 212, p. 243. He called his chapter 'Decline of the Law'. In 1969 the Strauss Report on MPs conduct was ignored. In 1976 there was the (Salmon) Royal Commission on standards of conduct in Public life. A Register of Members' Interests was introduced in 1974 after the political and financial scandals surrounding John Poulson's companies. But registration was voluntary, or gentlemanly. Nolan recommended full and compulsory disclosure. 73. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards is Sir Gordon Downey, formerly of the senior Civil Service, the National Audit Office and the City of London: The Guardian, 7 November 1995. In 1978 Sir Ian Moncreiffe gamely reckoned that if the old species of gentleman was vanishing, or to be found only in 'a few select private zoos called clubs', a new generation of 'English leopards are, as usual, and with a long practice in camouflage, quietly engaged in adjusting their spots': Introduction, Douglas Sutherland, The English Gentleman, London, Debrett's Peerage, 1978, p. xi. 74.

Dickens's Mr Veneering in Our Mutual Friend liked everything 'bran-new'. Mr Clark appeared to make something of the fact that his colleague, Mr Michael Heseltine, had had to buy his own furniture 'While all the nouves in the Party think he is the real thing; (p. 349). It is just likely that Mr Clark was playing games of literary allusion - possibly of the sort he thought his nouves would not understand - in a book whose only real subject is Mr Clark. In fact, Mr Michael Ray Dibdin Heseltine (from 'the commercial middle-class of South Wales') did not only buy his own furniture but began his fortune by buying other people's: Robbins, Biographical Dictionary, p. 203. 77. See David Miller, On Nationality, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1996, p. 172. Miller calls for constitutional changes accompanied by a new sense of national identity which affirms collective interests and sentiments. 78. Jeremy Paxman, Friends in High Places.
