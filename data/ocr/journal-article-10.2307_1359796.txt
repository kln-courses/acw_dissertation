<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SUN AT NIGHT AND THE DOORS OF HEAVEN IN BABYLONIAN TEXTS Wolfgang Heimpel University of California, Berkeley Current common opinion attributes to the Babylonians' the belief that the sungod visited the netherworld at night.2 Such a belief seems plausible. All those for whom the dimensions "above" and "below" are absolute must conclude that the sun and the other heavenly bodies move through the world below during their daily course. In the case of the Babylonians this belief seems to be connected with the sungod's intimate knowledge of the realms of the dead: he shows the living and the dead the way; he can revive the dead; he is judge of "those above and those below."3 On the other hand, there existed the belief that the netherworld is a place of utter darkness, a "house whose inhabitants are deprived of light."4 Was it a house without windows that left its inhabitants in the dark while the house itself basked in light, or did the sun cease shining at night? To illuminate these and related questions I have surveyed Sumerian and Akkadian textual references that contain information on the actions of the sungod at night. Unfortunately the two potentially most important sources, the account of Gilgamew's crossing of Twin Mountain and Marduk's appointing of the sun to its duties in Enuma Eli,, are in a very poor state of preservation. Still, the source 1. The term Babylonians is used here for the inhabitants of Babylonia regardless of their presumed ethnicity. The only textual reference that is not of Babylonian origin is the Neo- Assyrian text K.2401 (see below,p. 137); it does not affect the reconstruction of concepts described in this article.

Dann bestieg er den Sonnenwagen und geriet abends am anderen iussersten Ende der Welt aus dem Blick: dort, wo sich ein anderer 'Eingang zur Unterwelt' in Harali, dem Land des Goldes befand; und nachts erleutete er die Unterwelt." 3.

The sun rests at night In the Old Babylonian "Prayer to the Gods of the Night"5 a priest implores the "great gods of night" to assist him in his divination. He describes the night around him by evoking "the closed gates that were open (during the day), the silent people that were noisy (during the day)." He then turns his attention to the world of the gods: "The gods of the land, the goddesses of the land, Sama-, Sin, Adad, and Pstar, have entered the lap of heaven. They do not render a verdict. They do not make decisions over anything" (lines 5-8). What they do is not said. But we get an indication when we read a few lines later: "The judge over what is true, the father of orphans, Sama-, entered his chamber." The word kummu, rendered here as "chamber," designates a private room or suite where one slept," rested,7 or talked with one's wife.8 The Sumerian equivalent of kummu is agrun (E.NUN).9 Daybreak is often referred to as the time when Utu emerges from his chamber: "With the flowing light, with heaven's foot brightening, with the birds giving voice at the flowing light, Utu emerged from the chamber" (Gilgames and jlalub 47-49). At night Utu enters this chamber: "Evenings, when the stars ..., when Utu enters the chamber.'1 In his chamber he rests for the night, as implied in Lugalbanda's words: "When you (Utu) lie down the people lie down with you. When you, youth Utu, rise the people rise with you" (Lugalbanda and Hurrum 235-36).11 The chamber'2 belongs to a house that is mentioned without name in a phrase from the same text: Lugalbanda turns to the setting sun, which is described 5.

Caplice argues that kummu and its Sumerian equivalent agrun "is a kenning or alternate name in Mesopotamian mythological texts for the subterranean apsu, and that it was conceived as the habitat of Enki and the gods associated with him as well as of demons who do harm to men, and the region traversed by the sun in its nighttime passage from setting point to rising point" (Or NS 42 [1973] 304). The sole textual basis for this view is what Caplice calls the "classical text on the 'chamber' of Ea," one and a half lines from Enuma Eli (I 175f.) which he translates: "he (Ea) rested in peace in his 'chamber' which he called apsta." He</page><page sequence="3">THE SUN AT NIGHT AND THE DOORS OF HEAVEN 129 as "Utu setting his face toward his house" (line 139).13 A detailed account of what the sungod does in this house and its name is contained in the "Sunset Prayer""4: "Utu, when you enter heaven's interior, may the pure bolt of heaven greet you. May the door of heaven pray to you. May Law, your beloved vizier, go straight toward you. Let your greatness shine toward the White House, the seat of your royalty. May Sherda, your beloved spouse, meet you happily. May she calm your heart with cool water. May she set before you the meal of your godhead. . .. Utu, make straight your way, go the true road to your 'level place.' Utu, you are the judge of the land (kalam), the one who straightens out its decisions." Here the setting sun is seen as a god who comes home in the evening after a day's work of crossing the heavens. His vizier meets him, his wife greets him and serves him dinner. This very anthropomorphic scenario was probably believed to continue with Utu going to bed to sleep, being awakened before dawn, understands this sentence to represent "an outright identification of this term (kummu) with the subterranean watery region of the apsa." Seen in its context the sentence can and should be understood differently. After binding and killing Apsu, the monster, and putting his counselor Mummu behind bars, Ea "established over Apsu his seat (?ubtu). He gripped Mummu, held (him by) his leash. After he had bound, had killed his enemies, Ea displayed him as memorial of his victory over his antagonists. Inside his kummu he rested relaxedly. And he called'his'name Apsu. And he'made known' the sanctuaries. In that place he founded the/a Gipar. And Ea and Damkina, his spouse, sat among great things" (I 71-78). Ea's new home as a whole is called here gubtu, "seat." The terms kummu, elrstu (sanctuaries) and giparu are parts of this whole. That the private quarters, kummu, alone should bear the name Apsu, as the wording of the passage does indeed suggest, is not likely. We expect the name to cover the complex as a whole, as is clearly expressed in IV 142f . In those lines Marduk is said to have taken the measure of his own abode by matching it to Apsu, "the seat (?ubtu) of Nudimmud." Caplice refers in his note 14 to two other passages from Enuma elis that contain the word kummu and are supposedly consistent with his understanding. They are not and actually confirm the expected meaning "private quarters." The passage V 119ff. deals again with the founding of a seat of a god, this time Marduk's. He speaks to the gods who have assembled on the occasion of his victory. "I will build a house. And it shall be the seat of my pleasure. In it I will found its (the house's) cult centers. And I will found my kummu. I will see my kingship. When you come up from Apsu to assembly, this place shall be your stay for the night ... When you come down from heaven to assembly, this place shall be your stay for the night ..." (122-28). "This place" refers to the kummu, as the reply of the gods (the other passage referred to by Caplice) demonstrates: "In your kummu shall be our stay for the night. In it we will rest" (VI52). That the gods who "came up from the Apsu" should spend the night in a kummu which is the Apsu makes no sense. The passages show with all clarity that kummu designates the private quarters of a god in his house. 13. Cf. Wilcke Lugalbandaepos p. 78. 14. Seux Hymnes et pribres pp. 215f. According to its subscript this prayer was recited at sunset.</page><page sequence="4">130 WOLFGANG HEIMPEL being served breakfast, and so on. Unclear is the term "level place."'5 It may just be another term for "home." Yet also in KAR 227 ii 5 it is connected with Sama- as judge. We thus have to reckon with the possibility that the sungod was believed to fulfill there, at night, some of his duties as judge. Heaven's interior According to the Old Babylonian "Prayer to the Gods of the Night," sun, moon, venus, and Adad retired to the "lap of heaven." Von Soden did not consider the possibility of this translation of ti-tu-ul same, suggesting instead that ti-tu-ul is a form of utiilu, "to sleep."'1 He noted that the "infinitive construction" was odd but translated nevertheless: "(the gods) ... treten ein, um zu schlafen im Himmel." The verb "to enter" demands designation of a place for ti-tu-ul. This is readily available in the word utlu, "lap." The context of the phrase "lap of heaven" implies that this locality was found beneath the horizons because sun, moon, and venus were not visible at the time of prayer. "Heaven's interior" is also found beneath the horizons." According to the "Sunset Prayer," it was entered by the setting sun after crossing the door of heaven. In heaven's interior was located the White House where the sungod rested at night. He left heaven's interior before rising over the eastern horizon in the morning: "Great lord, when you emerge from pure heaven's interior; hero, youth Utu, when you emerge from pure heaven's interior; when you'bring close' (Akkadian: lift) the pegs of the key in the bolt of pure heaven; when you untie the latch of pure heaven; when you open the great door of pure heaven" (opening lines of the "Fourth House Prayer").18 The concept of heaven's interior that is documented in these passages leads us to expect that the moon too was thought to reside there in times of invisibility. This expectation is confirmed by a passage from the Sumerian 15. This is a literal translation of the Sumerian term ki-i'r. Falkenstein SAHG no. 42 translates "Wohnsitz"; Seux Hymnes et prieres p. 216, "residence"; AHw s.v. duru??u, "unterirdischer Rastplatz(?)." 16. ZA 43 (1936) 307. 17. Meissner, Babylonien und Assyrien 2 108, localizes heaven's interior "auf der dusseren Seite des (Himmels)gewdlbes"-that is, above the horizon but hidden from view by the two levels of heaven beyond the sphere to which the stars are affixed (according to KAR 307). The sun would thus reverse its course immediately after setting, cross above its day-time path to the eastern horizon, dip beneath it and rise from it, now again on the inside of the three- layered heaven. This illogical view is very unconvincing. 18. Seux Hymnes et prieres pp. 226ff. This prayer was recited by the conjuror in the Bit Rimki ritual as the king entered the fourth of a sequence of seven houses.</page><page sequence="5">THE SUN AT NIGHT AND THE DOORS OF HEAVEN 131 version of the introduction to the astrological series Enuma Anu Enlil'9: "When An, Enlil, Enki, the great gods, set up among themselves the great powers through their true counsel, they established the gondola of Suen. They established the waxing of the new moon, the giving birth to the month, and the (one unintelligible word) of heaven and earth. For the gondola to appear brightly in heaven, it (the gondola) emerged from heaven's interior." The use of the term "heaven's interior" in the "Sunset Prayer," the "Fourth House Prayer," and Enuma Anu Enlil is specific, referring to an interior that remains invisible to human eyes, being located as it is beneath the horizons. This specific use of the term is not found in the numerous passages of unilingual Sumerian texts from the Old Babylonian period. There, "heaven's interior" is far off in heaven but still in direct communica- tion with the surface of the earth, unobstructed by the horizons and doors that shut it off from view. Some examples that could easily be multiplied 19.

Ningirsu's temple in Girsu "is a great mountain, reaches heaven; is Utu, fills heaven's interior (Gudea Cyl. B i 6f.). Prow and stern of Sulgi's gondola carry "golden rams gleaming in heaven's interior" (Klein, Sulgi D 356). Inanna, standing in heaven, "looks on" or communicates in some other fashion with "the countries where the blackheaded people are abundant like sheep" (Inanna Hymn of Iddin-Dagan 80-82). I have not found in Old Babylonian texts a single instance where "heaven's interior" is used with the specific meaning attached to it in the late texts. This is true also for contexts where one might expect it, as for example in the opening lines of the "Incantation to Utu"20: "Utu, emerging from lapis lazuli heaven." The concept of heaven's interior is, however, attested for this period in the phrase "lap of heaven." Heaven's doors The concept of an interior of heaven, heaven's inside, requires entry and exit. It was provided by the concept of doors of heaven and parts of their interlinear translation but rather in two sections separated by a line. The second version, the Akkadian, is related to the first, the Sumerian, by ganig, "secondly," "otherwise." This indicates that the Akkadian text is to be understood not as a translation of the Sumerian but as an alternate version, just the two versions of an explanation in a commentary are related by ganlg. In fact, much of the Akkadian text cannot be understood as translation of the Sumerian. We find, for example, no correspondence in the Akkadian text to mi-gur8-dsuen-na and mA-gur8-an-na, or to the Akkadian phrase ana qdti ilani rab ti ukinnii in the Sumerian text. On the other hand, many phrases are clearly translations, as for example galga-ne-ne gi-na-ta = ina milkigunu kini. In some cases a translation of the Sumerian text seems to have been attempted. The sequence UD SAR SAR SAR DA could, and should, be interpreted as u4-sakar mi-mi-da, "to let the new moon wax." The Akkadian version has tima band, "to create day," as if the Sumerian had been analyzed as u = iamu and mui = banui. Misreading is suggested by the correspondence sa-an-na and qereb ?am&amp; u erseti, where sg-an-na seems to have been mistaken for sg-an-ki at some point in the transmission. Text B adds to the confusion by haplography, repeating the sequence ud-du-ti of line 12 in line 13. The writer of this text seems also not to have been familiar with the sign KAR if that is what he intended to write in line 5. The Sumerian text does not exhibit signs of corrupting influence from the Akkadian version and makes thus a more genuine and clearer impression even if it, too, has clearly suffered in the transmission. Take the sequence sd-an-na IGI bar-ra-ta-6: -ra-ta-6 requires a prefix which is not there. The text has bar, however, which we understand as deriving from an original form ba-ra-ta-e, misspelled as bar-ra-ta-6. The preceding IGI can hardly be igi because a compound verb or idiom igi e does not seem to exist. The prefix chain -i-ba-ra- does not exist either (there is sa-ba-ra-). We might therefore attach the IGI as si to the preceding word and see in it a syllabic spelling for -se. While 6 is usually combined with a separative, a terminative is occasionally found (see, for example, CT 16 9:11, abul-dutu-S -a--', glossed in UET 6 391:8 as i-na KA.GAL). After me-gal-gal an-ki-a (A2) a finite verbal form is missing. 20.

I present the following catalogue of all relevant passages known to me, ordered according to the god or gods passing these doors, gates, or gateways. A. Sungod 1. "Sunset Prayer" 1-3. "Utu, when you enter heaven's interior, may the pure bolt of heaven greet you. May the door of heaven pray to you." Here bolt and door are anthropomorphized, or possibly attendants are meant who move the bolt and hold open the door. One thinks of the pictorial representations on Old Akkadian cylinder seals where attendants are shown holding open the doorwings through which the sungod appears. In the textual references, the god who is said to cross a door of heaven is invariably described as opening the door by himself and neither door- keepers nor other attendants are mentioned. 2. "Fourth House Prayer" 1-5. "Utu, when you emerge from pure heaven's interior. . . , when you "bring close" (Akkadian: lift) the pegs of the key in the bolt of pure heaven, when you untie the latch of pure heaven, when you open the great door of pure heaven." 3. "Sixth House Prayer" 1-4.21 "Sama-, you lit up at the base of heaven. You opened the bolt of pure heaven. You opened the door of heaven. Sama-s, you raised your head over the land." While the "Fourth House Prayer" addresses Sama-s as he rises from the horizon, he is seen here as having risen already. This progress in the daily course of the sun surely corresponded to the progress of the ritual to which these prayers belonged. The same link is also manifest in the application of the term for the chamber of the ritual houses, the gutukku, to the path of the sun in the sky.22 4. In two Old Babylonian prayers23 the hepatoscopist asks for the kittu, a set of unambiguous markings, to be placed by Sama-s on the liver of the lamb. The diviner turns to the god who stands high in the sky: "Samas, you have opened the bolts of the doors of heaven. You have ascended the staircase of pure lapis lazuli." 5. Su'ila Prayer OECT 6 82ff. + AOAT 34 23:8-12. "You (Samas) provide a single person with a companion. You give an heir to the one who has no penis. You open the closed sikkuru of heaven." 21.

SamaS is addressed here as the one god who is chiefly responsible for the doors of heaven: "Opener of the doors of p[ure] heaven; Sama', TI-ka, socket, key, lift[er, you ]. Without you no god [ ] the doors of heaven." TI-ka is possibly an error for it-ti-ka, "with you," which would provide a fitting contrast to the "without you" of the following line. 7. The "Bit Mummu Prayer"24 contains the epithet "holder of the key of Anu" for Sama-. "Anu" stands here for the expected "heaven." The substitution is probably the result of Anu's particular standing in Uruk as principal god of the city in the last phase of its history. B. Sungod and moongod 8. Enuma Eli' V 9-11. After roofing heaven with one-half of Ti'amat's corpse, Marduk established the features of heaven, among them his abode E'ara, the districts of Anu, Enlil, and Ea, the stations of the gods of heaven, the sequence of stars by which the progress of the year was measured. He then "opened gateways in both ribcages (silli) and fastened bolts right and left, established the zenith in her liver." The function of the gateways is not stated in the text. The fact that they are two in number and on opposite sides of heaven indicates that they are the same entry and exit doors mentioned in the passages listed above. 9. In the composition "Exaltation of Pstar," which belongs to the local tradition of Uruk, Anu-not Marduk-is the creator and the one who appointed skin and moon to their respective functions: "To Sin and Sama- day and night . . , to the two gods, the guardians of heaven, to open the door(s) of Any."25 The "doors of Anu" represent the local version of the "doors of heavea." C. Moongod 10. Sj5berg Mondgott 167:20. "(Nanna,) the one who opens the door of heaven; the one who brings light to all mankind." 11. RA 12 (1915).191:3.

In Er'semma 163, which is called "Ersemma of Enlil" in the subscript, but is nevertheless addressed to Ninurta, this god is praised as vanquisher of rebels in the mountainland and plower of his father's fields. Embedded in a description of his aspect as vanquisher we find, quite unexpectedly, a passage concerning the doors of heaven. My inter- pretation of this passage differs considerably from that of Cohen; I therefore include here the transliteration of text A26 as well as of the syllabic parallel UET 6 200:7-10, which was not used by Cohen.

The verb gub in the phrase giig gub is translated into Akkadian by tu?-BAL-ki- [x]. This was restored as tu?-bal- ki-[it] by all translators, and the phrase was consequently understood as an idiom for the act of dislodging a door. That ubalkutu could be said of doors is in fact attested.27 Only the meaning for gub, that is, "to stand," does not seem to fit this phrase. Among the numerous Akkadian translations of the ubiquitous verb is found the equation sila gub-gub-bu : ne-pe-el-ku-ti, "to be wide open, said of public places.2s The S-stem of nepelki is found in sentences with doors or gates as grammatical object. It then means "to open wide, said of doors," and the Sumerian equivalent gigig gub "to let stand (open), said of doors.""2 The translation of the remaining lines is only tentative. The Sumerian version seems to describe the normal motions of opening a door while the Akkadian verbs ?abatu, nussubu, and especially ?ullutu indicate destructive action. My efforts to disentangle the lexical difficulties were not successful. Yet I believe that we can find a solution if we proceed to the question of what Ninurta had to do with the doors of heaven in the first place. One of Ninurta's epithets in the text is "lord of Eninnu" (line 3). This indicates that the Ninurta of the text is really a Nippurianized Ningirsu. On the latter's turf, the territory of Laga', Utu does not seem to have been venerated.3" His place was filled, in fact, by Ningirsu as a passage from cylinder A of Gudea demonstrates: In a dream Ningirsu reveals himself to the prospective builder of his house. He speaks of the various temples he owns in the territory of Laga-, mentioning the particular functions he executes in them. One of the temples was called White House, which of course is the name of the temples of the sungod in Sippar and Larsa, and in heaven's interior; in it, so says Ningirsu, "I appear brilliantly like Utu, set straight the law of my city like Istaran" (x 24-26). If we conclude that Ningirsu, and by extension Ninurta, incorporated the aspect of a sungod, 27. AHw 2 sub nabalkutu S 6 b. 28. MSL 11 182 1123'. 29. A translation "to stand open" for gub in the phrase gilig gub fits the references that Cooper collected for his commentary on line 168 of the "Curse on Agade." He translates abul-kalam-ma-ka sgiig im-ma ba-e-gub, "the doors of all the city-gates of the land lay dislodged in the dirt." If we understand im-ma to mean "in the wind" we arrive at the, obviously age-old, image of open doors flapping in the wind in deserted settlements: "In the city-gates of the land the doors stood open in the wind." The same image is expressed somewhat differently in the "Eridu Lament" (Green, JCS 30 [1978] 132:2, 4): "giig-bi u4-d6 im-ma-gub, "Its (the city-gate's) door stood open to the weather." 30.

At the same time we can understand the Akkadian translator who, like any other non-Lagashite Babylonian, may not have been familiar with this Lagashite notion and, hard-pressed to make sense of the passage, connected it with the war-like aspect of the setting, thus arriving at the idea that the god in his rage moved so far east that he ended up destroying the doors of sunrise. The Lagashites could connect the two themes naturally: Ningirsu fought against the enemy in the eastern mountains on the occasion of his rise from the eastern horizon and after opening the doors of heaven there. F. A'sur 14. The Neo-Assyrian text K.240131 contains in column ii 10-32 a section whose core is an address of the god Awssur to an unnamed king.

I will let fire consume them (your enemies). You (think you) stand among them (now, but) I have (already) lifted them from your face and made them go up into the mountains. Stones and heat I let rain upon them." Von Soden derived at-ta-qa-al-la-al-la from an N-form of ?uqallulu, and translated tentatively "I floated down."32 This is not consistent with the fact that the doors and gateways of heaven are in line with the horizons and not in a region of heaven from which the god could descend to the earth. I suggest that we connect the form with anqullu, "heat," posit an R-stem, and translate: "I became intensely hot." It fits the context well: A-ssur emerges as sungod from the gateway of heaven on the eastern horizon, at this low position in the sky already burning with the kind of heat the sun sends down at noon, as is expressed in line 179 of the Great Sama's Hymn33: "who sends down heat (anqullu) to the earth at midday." G. Unidentified god 15. A gateway of heaven is mentioned twice in a prayer that was edited by Ebeling under the title "Gebet an einen verfinsterten Gott."34 It is addressed to a male god who is never named. He is called "the beloved of 31. ABRT 1 22f. 32. Or NS 20 (1951) 262. 33. Seux Hymnes et prieres pp. 51ff. 34.

The obscuration of his face (idura panaka) constituted the calamity against which the prayer was spoken. As a consequence of that obscuration the Igigu were also obscured, heaven turned bad (ilmena), the Anunakku cried, the "sides of the queen of Irkalla were stripped (of clothes), darkness (e-ti-[tu])35 was set in the gateway of heaven." Also obscured were temples and their priests, and, finally, the farmer (mar ikkari) "did not bring out za-r[u x (x)]."36 After this description of the calamity the praying individual utters his request for an end of this state of affairs: uddi? anbatka, "renew (your strength and cast off) your tiredness." The text concludes with an expression of the expectation that things will return to their former good state again: "The heaven may become light (again). The Igigu may truly take turn after turn in their guard-stations. The Anunakku may become happy. The interior of the earth [ ]. The queen of Irkalla may lock [ ]. [ ] may be in the gateway of heaven. .... The farmer may finish za-ru [x (x)] in your light. The musician may praise with a lyre(-song) the king of gods. The cantor(?) may (li-ri-[ ]) the drum." Ebeling took the clue for his interpretation from the motif of the farmer and, noting that he would have been working at day, concluded that the obscured god was Sama's and that the prayer was a response to a solar eclipse. CAD quotes the text consistently as a hymn to Sin, implying that the obscuration is, in fact, a lunar eclipse. This interpretation can hardly be harmonized with the motif of the farmer. But also Ebeling's interpretation does not really fit if we follow the wording of line 11 closely. It reads: idur mar ikkari ul us# d za-r[u x (x)], "The farmer became obscured. He did not bring out the za-r[u x (x)]." Ebeling translated us~di as "setzt nicht fort," which is consistent with his idea of a farmer who is surprised by a solar eclipse while working in the field. But the verb means "brought out," not "ceased." Accordingly the situation was quite different. The farmer did not bother to bring out the za-ru [x (x)] at the start of his work in the morning because of the general obscuration that had befallen gods and men. Such a condition points rather to a spell of bad weather: sunrise could not be observed; the interior of temples, dimly lit at any time, was so dark that normal activities ceased there; with no sun and shade at day and no moon or stars visible at 35. Thus Ebeling, Or NS 17 (1948) 416ff. AHw and CAD did not accept a word etitu, "darkness," in addition to the better attested etfitu. Ebeling's reading and translation seem inevitable, however. 36. Ebeling read za-r[u zdri (?)], "der Saer des Samens"; CAD and AHw create a hapax zarttu, "Saat." A form of zartI, "to winnow," may in fact be meant.</page><page sequence="13">THE SUN AT NIGHT AND THE DOORS OF HEAVEN 139 night one could not tell the time and only after the obscuration had ended could the Igigu keep their watches again. Why this condition should have kept the farmer at home depends on the interpretation of za-ru [x (x)]. The obscuration was not, or not just, lack of sunlight, moonlight, and starlight but, according to the phrase "the queen of Irkalla may lock [ ]," also the result of open doors of the netherworld. Their relation to the "gateway of heaven" is unfortunately not clear. H. Star gods 16. OECT 6 12 K.3507:8-15. "Motionless is the countryside, barred are the doors, [ ], put in place are the bolts. Silent is/are [ ]. Open are the gateways of w[ide] heaven. Great gods of night for whom [ ] my white sheep, enter, gods of night, stars [ ], (list of starts and constellations), enter, gods of night."'7 Here the stars and constellations, called "gods of night," are conceived as "entering" the visible part of the night-sky through "gateways of heaven." While the stars on or near the ecliptic could have been thought of as using the eastern door of heaven that sun, moon, and venus used, others are too far from the ecliptic for such a scenario. Included in the star list is Ursa Major, a constellation whose center is approximately 60o north of the ecliptic, and the constellation BIR which must be sought deep in the southern sky "where the south wind rises" (ACh lstar 26:12). Accordingly we must expect that the Babylonians assigned to each "god of night" his or her own entrance into the night-sky on the eastern horizon. This is, in fact, confirmed by the plural "gateways of heaven." Such an arrangement also allows the concept of the numerous gateways of the stars, which are open at night, to coexist with the notion of the door through which the sungod passes at sunrise, which is closed at the same time. 17. In similar context the "Prayer to the Gods of Night" (KUB 4 37) mentions the "gateways of the great gods." The phrase is an abbreviated version of the idea of individual gateways through which the star-gods entered the night-sky. 18.

The qualification "of heaven" is consistent with the concept of heaven's interior: the heavenly gods passed through these doors from the visible to the invisible part of the sky and vice versa without ever leaving heaven, their realm. The sungod is more often associated with the doors of heaven than is any other god, and the opening of the doors is described in detail only in those passages that mention the sungod as passing through. A special relationship between the sungod and the doors of heaven is expressed explicitly in no. 6, where the sungod is characterized as the one god chiefly responsible for these doors. It is therefore likely that the concept of the doors of heaven was originally tied to that of the setting and rising sun. Secondarily, it was related to other gods who, because of their motion along the same path, could be visualized as using the same doors. A third step in the evolution of the concept is constituted by the assignment of individual "gateways" on the eastern horizon for the use of the various star gods. This step is attested in a text from BoghazkSy, no. 17, and thus goes back at least to the Old Babylonian period. The first attestation of a door is the personal name from an Ur III text, no. 18. It is very likely that the doors through which the sungod passes on pictorial representations of the Old Akkadian period are our doors of heaven.

That apparently meant crossing Twin Mountain, something that had not been attempted before on account of the darkness prevailing there, as can be gathered from some 39. Gilg.

For about thirty lines it is altogether missing.41 It resumes with Gilgame-s speaking to the scorpion man. He has prevailed and is now free to pass a "gateway," presumably the aforementioned gate of Twin Mountain, onto the twelve-double-hours-long "road of Samas." The route of the first seven double-hours is reported in a strictly repetitious pattern of three lines each: As he reached the n-th double-hour [circa 4-6 signs missing]. Thick was darkness. There was no light. [ ] does not allow him [ ] his/its rear. For the eighth and ninth double-hour the first of these three lines is different. It is unintelligible for the eighth; for the ninth it contains the word "north-wind" and, in the last part of a probably indented line, "his face." With the tenth double-hour the pattern changes. Lines 2 and 3 of the refrain do not occur again. In the section on the tenth double-hour is found the phrase "is close," in that of the eleventh "he came out before Sama~," in the last section "it was light." Thereupon Gilgame-s found himself in a garden of jewels from where he reached Siduri's alehouse by the sea.42 According to current opinion, the road of Sama-s between sunset and sunrise was conceived of as a tunnel through Twin Mountain.43 Such a notion is inconsistent with the concept of heaven's interior, with its ample space for the White House and the many other dwellings of the moon, the planets, and the stars. It also is inconsistent with the belief that the sungod visited 40. Gilg. III 9-11. 41. Edzard's discussion of the passage in Or NS 54 (1985) 52f. is important insofar as it rejects the many restorations that have been assumed in translations. Edzard comes to the conclusion: "Der Passus entzieht sich noch gainzlich unserer Deutung." 42. The text is based on K.2360+, published by Campbell Thompson Gilgames pl. 34ff., who assumed an average of 50 lines per column. However, the pattern of the repetitions in iv "47"ff. requires that the first preserved line of column v is line 6. Col. v thus has a length of 34 lines. If that is also true for cols. iii and iv, the break between iii 21 and iv "33" amounts to 29 lines and not 60 as Campbell Thompson's numbering implies. 43.

As long as we aspire to consistency we have to assume that the "road of Samals" was open, imagined perhaps as a corridor from sunset to sunrise that was traversed by an earthbound creature such as Gilgame, on the ground and by a heavenbound creature such as Sama-, above ground, in the sky of heaven's interior. How can we account for the prevailing darkness in such a model? If the road of Sama's was light when Sama-, traversed it, Gilgame's could simply have waited for such time and the story would be pointless. If it was dark at all times on the road of Sama', then the sun must have been dark as it travelled overhead. Such a notion may well have existed. "The sun rose" is expressed in Akkadian by the phrase Samas ippub. The verb napabu means "to blow" and is applied to the act of blowing on glowing embers to produce a flaming fire. In this case, the verb is also used ingressively with the meaning "to flare up." Blowing on embers must have been a daily occurrence in ancient Mesopotamian households. One did not produce fire, which was a difficult and tedious process. Instead, one must have relied on keeping fires going even if fuel was precious. When not in use, the fire was covered so as to keep it as low as possible without extinguishing it; when flame was needed one blew on the glowing embers. The application of the term napdbu to rising heavenly bodies and perhaps sii, "to cover," to the setting sun suggests that at some point in the development of Babylonian thinking the sun was conceived as fire that was covered by the earth as it sank beneath the horizon and thus reduced from flaming to glowing. When it rose from the horizon it was fanned by the moving air, the "morning breeze" perhaps, into the flaming stage again. The same process applied to all heavenly bodies. Against the background of such a concept the darkness on the road becomes understandable even if that road is in the open: the heavenly bodies do not shine in the world below. It is possible that the mention of the north-wind in connection with the ninth double-hour down the road of Sama-s was understood as the kindling agent for the sun that brought about dawn.44 Two features of the road of Sama, defy logical explanation. One is the grotesquely low measure of the distance. For the Babylonians the breadth of the earth was proverbially immeasurable. The twelve double-hours 44. Compare perhaps muAabmit ziq KUR ur-ri in line 18 of the "Great Samas Hymn." Seux, Hymnes et prieres p. 53 n. 15, suggests the reading z;q at urri, "morning breeze," instead of Lambert's odd interpretation in BWL p. 318f. and its spin-offs in CAD etc. While Seux's interpretation of the phrase ziq Afat urri in itself is convincing, its position as object of mugabmit remains difficult. We expect Samag's fire to be the object of the morning breeze.</page><page sequence="17">THE SUN AT NIGHT AND THE DOORS OF HEAVEN 143 seem to stand in connection with the length of the day. But how so? The other problem is the orientation of Twin Mountain. This mountain guards sunset and sunrise; it was thus imagined as stretching from the eastern to the western horizon, presumably underneath, on the invisible side of the earth. The mountain has "upper sides" which reach "zenith," and a "breast," presumably its lower sides, which reach Arallu, the netherworld. Did it occur to the Babylonians that this mountain, the "road of Sama*," and Gilgames walking on it, should have been upside down? It is possible that the lost passage in which the scorpion man gave Gilgame's information about Twin Mountain contained a solution to these problems. The concept of the mountains of sunrise and sunset does not contain an answer, either. Since these mountains are closely associated with our topic, the relevant passages are reviewed in the following section. Mountains of sunset and sunrise In a prayer to the sungod on behalf of a pregnant woman are found the following lines: "Utu, when you emerge from pure heaven's interior, when you cross over the jUaur(-tree) mountains, may Bunene, the vizier with whom you are happy, speak (to you); may Justice stand to your right; may Law stand to your left; . . ; may this woman give birth safely."45 Here the motifs of heaven's interior and the mountain of sunrise are connected in a completely natural way: the sun first emerges from heaven's interior and then crosses over the mountains. The same concept is expressed in a similar way already in "Lugalbanda and Enmerkar" 223-24. Lugalbanda is praying to the rising sun: "Bright bull, emerging from heaven's base, bull, you... over the Ua*ur(-trees)." The phrase "like Utu who came forth from the Uasur(-trees)" in TCL 15 7:13 can be understood as an abbreviated statement of the same image. The "Third House Prayer""46 mentions as place of sunrise also a mountain: "Utu, when you emerge from the great mountain (kur-gal/?adi rabi), when you emerge from the great mountain, the mountain of springs (kur-idim / ?ad nagbi), when you emerge from Holy Hill, the place where the destinies were decided, when you emerge from where heaven and earth embrace, from heaven's base." Seux translates the phrase kur-idim / ?ad nagbi as "montagne a nappe souterrain," and suggests a subterranean 45. BA 10 1, 11ff.; Seux Hymnes et pribres pp. 216ff.; Borger, Or NS 54 (1985) 14ff. 46.

If such a location could indeed be substantiated, we would have in this passage a conceptual link to the notion of Twin Mountain. However, the equation du6-ku : apst cannot be generalized. The Holy Hill is the original home of sheep and grain according to the "Disputation between Sheep and Grain," and thus was not, at least not always, subterranean. The mountain of sunrise is occasionally called "cedar mountain." In the "Tigi Song to Inanna," Dumuzi, here visualized as a constellation, is compared to "Utu when he emerges from the mountain of cedar resin" (CT 36 33f.:27f.). The prayer K.3333+47 opens with the words "you lit up, SamaS, 'in' the mountain of cedars," and in an inscription of Nabonidus we find the phrase "just like Sama", the very great lord, in his lighting up 'from' the mountain of cedars" (OECT 1 27 iii 10-11). In the last two references the cedar plays a role in the context and thus may have triggered the expression "mountain of cedars." The prayer K.3333+ is followed by a ritual that requires the priest to bring "cedar" before Samal. The inscription of Nabonidus describes the rebuilding of the Samas temple, the White House, in Sippar with "strong cedars from Labnanu, the pure forest" (OECT 1 27 iii 1-3). The references for the mountain of sunrise that mention cedars have created some confusion among scholars. When used as a name, Cedar Mountain designates the Amanus, which cannot of course be a mountain of sunrise for Mesopotamians. Gelb4s and Kramer,49 referring also to a passage in the Lugalannemundu inscription where a Cedar Mountain is listed among other geographical names together with Elam, posited an eastern Cedar Mountain. Since cedars are not supposed to have grown in the southern Zagros east of Babylonia, Hansman argued that the word translated "cedar" really designates a type of cypress that does grow there.50 I suggest that we should understand the phrase "mountain of cedars" here not as a name but as a generic term evoking the image of the high mountains with their resiny trees among which the cedar was of course the most impressive. In a passage from the "Incantation to Utu," cedar and Ua*ur(-tree) mountains are mentioned side by side: "Utu, the upper sea is yours, Utu, the lower sea is yours. Utu, the mountain of cedar, the mountain of JUalur is yours" (OrAnt 8 8:33-35). The contrast "upper sea" and "lower sea" 47. Oppenheim Dreambook pl. 2, pp. 301, 340. 48.

Iraq 38 (1976) 23ff.</page><page sequence="19">THE SUN AT NIGHT AND THE DOORS OF HEAVEN 145 suggests that also the cedar and Uasur mountains were seen as being at opposite ends of a line. Combined with the fact of Utu's ownership of these mountains they could well be the mountains of sunset and sunrise. There is, as far as I know, only one explicit reference to the mountain of sunset. Tablet XII of Utukku lemnutu contains an enumeration of inaccessible places that are haunted by a group of seven demons. Two such places are the "dark mountain" and the "light mountain" (bur-sag-gi6 and bur-sag- babbar). According to the Akkadian translation or interpretation, the former was the "mountain of sunset," the latter the "mountain of sunrise." The demons, so the text continues, were born on the dark mountain and raised on the light mountain. The grown-up demons return from time to time to these places of their youth and there they "run about" and "play."51 The passage demonstrates that the image of a mountain of the sunset existed. Yet this image does not seem to have been as clearly developed as that of the sunrise, which corresponds of course to the natural setting of Mesopotamia with mountains in the east and flat steppe in the west.52 The references for mountains of sunset and sunrise differ in two aspects from the concept of Twin Mountain in the Gilgames Epic. They provide not a particular name but a descriptive phrase-zasaur(-tree) mountain, cedar mountain, spring mountain, dark mountain, light mountain-and they are located in that part of the world that the sungod overlooks by day. Twin Mountain on the other hand is the location over which the sungod crosses by night. The twin peaks of the sunrise scenes on Old Akkadian cylinder seals are consistent with the notion of the mountains of sunrise above the 51. CT 16 44:84ff.; von Weiher Uruk 1 ii 2ff. 52. In the absence of passages that attest a clearly developed image about the end of the earth in the west, one should resist the temptation to substitute one's own images. See, for example, Bottero: "pour se rendre A l'Extreme Occident du Monde, lA ou se trouvait l'6norme faille qui permettait au soleil de 'descendre' tous les soirs sous la terre" (ZA 73 [1983] 191). Jacobsen understood the statement of the Sumerian kinglist "Meskiaggaser entered the sea and came up to the mountains" as a "reflection of the daily journey of the sun. In the evening the sun goes down into the sea in the west. During the night it travels underground, and in the morning it comes out to the mountains in the east" (Jacobsen Kinglist 86 n. 114). Statements in the "Great Samas Hymn" demonstrate that the rays could penetrate water: "Samas, your rays descended in Apsu; the Labmu, those (monsters) of the sea, behold your light" (37f.) and "[there is nothing that] descends in Apsu without you(r light)" :(57). Yet there is no evidence for the image of the sun setting in the sea. The movements of Mesikiaggaser may find a more rational explanation if we consider the tradition that his son Enmerkar grew up in Aratta (Wilcke Lugalbandaepos p. 43). Putting two and two together, it is to be concluded that Meiskiaggaler left Sumer by way of the Persian Gulf and ended up in Aratta, somewhere in southeastern or eastern Iran.</page><page sequence="20">146 WOLFGANG HEIMPEL horizon, but, despite the coincidence of the name Twin Mountain with the representation of twin peaks, they are not consistent with the notion of Twin Mountain as known from the Gilgames Epic. The sun in the netherworld In the first of two elegies that Kramer discovered on an Old Babylonian tablet from the Pushkin museum, an individual expresses his grief about the death of his father. He remembers the latter's importance in life and the loss that his death means for his family and community. He then turns to the future of the deceased in the netherworld and utters in that context the following words: "Utu, the great . .. of Arallu, will, after he has turned the dark place into day, judge your judgment. May Nanna decide your destiny on the 'day of lying.' Nergal, the Enlil of the land (kur) ..."53 Kramer concluded that "the Sumerian sages-or at least some of them-held the view that the sun, after setting, continues its journey through the Nether World at night, and . . that the moongod Nanna spends his 'Day of Sleep' in the Nether World."54 The belief in a sungod who brings his light to the netherworld where he functions as judge is also attested in a prayer to Samas: "You (Samas) open the gateway of the wide earth. You bring light to the Anunakku. You complete the judgment" (KAR 32:30f.). "Gateway of the wide earth" is an unusual designation of the door of heaven leading into heaven's interior. It expresses the idea that Samag looks "down" in heaven's interior on the netherworld, the "wide earth." The "judgment" is probably a verdict concerning the future of a dead person in the netherworld, as in the passage from the first Pushkin Elegy.55 This role of the sungod is expressed in the common epithet "judge of those above and below." In the Bit Mummu Prayer, Samag is also credited with bringing light to the netherworld: "unceasing mark (of orientation), light of those below" (Seux Hymnes et prieres 232:6). In the same text Samag's stay in the netherworld is made explicit: "(Samas) who keeps track of the dead gods within Arallu" (line 9). It is obvious that the notion of a sungod who visits and lights the netherworld creates problems of consistency with the notions of heaven's 53. Kramer, Two Elegies pp. 88-91. 54. Kramer, Two Elegies p. 50. 55. Bottero believes that this judgment, in Akkadian sources at least, "c'6tait surtout d6cider: assigner, imposer un 'destin,' sans pour cela faire obligatoirement entrer en compte les merits ou les d6merites de ceux A qui on l'imposait" (Mesopotamia 8 [1980] 34).</page><page sequence="21">THE SUN AT NIGHT AND THE DOORS OF HEAVEN 147 interior and the sun as dimly glowing below the earth. Before attempting to resolve these problems we have to consider a passage from the "Great Samag Hymn" which demonstrates that beliefs about the sun were not necessarily consistent. The sun does not rest at night How did the sungod manage to rest at night when he had to cover the distance from the western to the eastern horizon during that time? This question must have been asked by the Babylonians again and again. Greek mythology produced the clever solution of a boat that transported the sleeping sun, while on the other hand Homer and Hesiod attest the idea of an "untiring" sungod.56 At some point the Babylonians arrived at the same concept that is attested by Hesiod-the restless sun: "You (Samas) have exerted yourself daily, (but) your face does not darken. You persevere at night; you kindled [ ]. For unknown distances and countless double- hours, Samag, you remain sleepless, you who come by day and return by night" ("Great Samag Hymn" 41-44).57 It is very possible that the phrase "unceasing mark (or orientation)" in the Bit Mummu Prayer refers to the same concept. Thoughts on the relation between the various notions of the sun's activities at night The sungod rests at night and he is restless; he stays in the White House in heaven's interior and he judges the dead or keeps track of dead gods in the netherworld; his fire is reduced so that he does not shine and he brings his light to the netherworld; the dead face him in the netherworld and they are deprived of sunlight there. How do these disparate notions relate to each other? The concept of the resting sun pertains to a fully anthropomorphic sungod who had the regular needs of a human, including sleep at night. The concept of the restless sun was a rationalization of the observation that the sun sets in the west and rises in the east, thus covering at least the distance of the earth's diameter in the course of one night. It is possible that 56. Pauly-Wissowa s.v. "Helios" 92 and 88. 57. The change of tenses in the translation imitates the change of preterit and present tense forms in the Akkadian text.

Read accordingly ta-sab-b [ur], against Lambert's copy and transliteration in BWL p. 128 and pl. 35.</page><page sequence="22">148 WOLFGANG HEIMPEL this notion developed as the straightforward anthropomorphization of the sun waned. It is also possible that it predates the evolution of an anthropomorphic sungod and survived the superimposition of the anthro- pomorphic notion of the resting sun. The seemingly conflicting notions of a sun losing luminescence at night yet shining on the netherworld may well be compatible. The phenomenon of dusk with light emanating from the point where the sun set should have been understood as demonstrating that the sun kept on shining below the western horizon. In accord with the ideas of heaven's interior and the sungod's visit to the netherworld, dusk would have been the time when the sungod shone on the netherworld from his location in heaven's interior "above." Possibly this was also the time when the sungod concerned himself with matters of the dead who had recently arrived in the netherworld. The "Sunset Prayer" connects the topic of Utu going home to the White House in heaven's interior with the request "go to the 'level place'" and the statement "you are the judge of the kalam" (Seux Hymnes et pri res p. 216). The 'level place' may have been the location where the sungod judged the dead. The passage from the Pushkin Elegies also connects the judging of a dead individual with the bringing of light to the netherworld. These connections localize the activities of the sungod as judge of the dead in the general vicinity of the western horizon. This is consistent with a passage from a ritual aiming at relocating the spirit of a dead person in the abode of the dead: it requires the spirit to go west.58 The gradual dimming of the light at dusk and its subsequent total extinction may have been understood either as the sole effect of the sun's increasing distance from the western horizon or as a combination of this movement and an actual dimming and subsequent total loss of lumin- escence of the sun's fire. The term napiitbu, "to flare up," for the rise of luminous heavenly bodies and the prevailing darkness on the "road of Samas" across Twin Mountain demonstrates the possibility of this latter understanding. Accordingly, a complex of beliefs about the sun's activities 58. Bottero, ZA 73 (1983) 191ff. However, there is for the time being no clear evidence for the concept that the western door through which the sungod passes is identical with the entrance to the netherworld. Bottero speaks in Mesopotamia 8 (1980) 32 of "la Grande-Porte (KA.GAL.dUTU.Sj.A) de l'Enfer," referring to CT 16 9 i 11f. where, augmented by UET 6 392:15 and 391:8 (not used by Bottero), it is stated merely that a group of evil demons "emerged." Since demons could be found anywhere in the world and not just in the netherworld, their associations with the "gateway of sunset" does not link the latter with the netherworld.</page><page sequence="23">THE SUN AT NIGHT AND THE DOORS OF HEAVEN 149 upon setting can be pieced together: the sungod opens the western door of heaven (called once "gateway of the wide earth"). He brings his light to the previously dark places below the horizon and to the Anunakku who dwell there. Because of the lack of draft and being shut off from the atmosphere above, his light dims gradually. He proceeds to the "level place" and concerns himself with the matters of the dead. He then goes home to his residence, the White House, where his wife has prepared his dinner. Later he enters his chamber and sleeps. There are at least two features that do not seem to fit into this scenario. The phrase from the Pushkin Elegy "After he (Utu) has turned the dark palace into day" uses the word "day" and thus raises the question of whether it does not rather refer to a notion that the netherworld enjoys days and nights like the world above.59 Such a notion is plausible if one believed that the sun did not lose its luminescence in the world below. That we have to reckon with the (at least temporal) coexistence of inconsistent notions is demonstrated by the case of the restless versus the resting sun. One might even combine the two pairs of inconsistencies, linking the concept of the restless sun with that of a perpetually shining one and the concept of the resting sun with that of a sun losing its luminescence. The former link might be illustrated by the characterization of Samas in the Bit Mummu Prayer: "unceasing mark (of orientation), light of those below." The general and pervasive negative value that the Babylonians attributed at all times to the netherworld must warn us not to assume that they actually believed in night and day in the netherworld. For the time being, it seems safer to assume that the word "day" in the phrase "he turned the dark place into day" meant nothing more than "(sun)light" and was compatible with the notion of a gradually dimming sun in the netherworld. The second feature presents us with a more fundamental problem, which affects any concept of sunlight in the netherworld. In a passage from the Old Babylonian text of the Gilgames Epic the hero asks Samas: "When may a dead person see sunlight?" ("Tablet X" i 15). Such a question could not have been asked in a world where the answer "at dusk" or even "all night long" was possible. We may try to solve the problem by assuming that the abode of the dead proper shut out sunlight. According to a stock phrase in Standard Babylonian literary texts, this abode was a "house 59. Compare further Gilgames's death A (SEM 24+25:25'f.): [ ] TUR-dutu-ke4 kur-ra ki-ku,0-ku,0-ka u4 bu-mu-na-an-ga-ga, "[ ] ... of Utu may place for him day(light) in the land on the dark places."</page><page sequence="24">150 WOLFGANG HEIMPEL whose inhabitants are deprived of light." The house itself may have been basking in the sun. However, the abode of the dead is not just imagined as a "house"; it was also a city (Irkalla), and probably a space open to heaven's interior so as to make it possible for Samas to keep track of the dead gods "within Arallu." Furthermore, the concept of the sungod as judge of the dead implies that he came face to face with the dead in the netherworld. Did they face a dark sungod? Or are we perhaps on the wrong track in our attempt to find consistency in the beliefs about something that could not be directly observed? The Babylonians may have resigned themselves to conceptual discontinuity: they found it natural that the sungod knew the world below, they saw in their sungod a judge of the living and the dead, and they believed that the dead would not see sunlight in their other- worldly existence. The contradictions arising from these beliefs may well have been consciously and unconsciously suppressed. Conclusions The activities of the sungod at night, contained in the Sumerian and Akkadian textual references surveyed above, can be listed in their succession as follows: 1. Opening of the western door of heaven; 2. Passing this door and entering thereby heaven's interior; 3. Bringing light to the region below the western horizon and its inhabitants; 4. Judging the dead, possibly at a location called "level place"; 5. Entering the White House in heaven's interior; 6. Eating the evening meal in the White House; 7. Sleeping in the chamber agrun / kummu; 8. Emerging from the chamber; 9. Opening and passing the eastern door of heaven. The sequences 4-5 and 7-8 are not yet attested explicitly. All actions except 4 are daily occurrences.60 Parallel to this succession of actions of the anthropomorphic sungod, a gradual change takes place in the intensity of the fire of the solar disk. Its luminescence decreases upon setting, remaining for the time of dusk light 60. The participation of the moongod in the shaping of the stay of the dead in the netherworld on the occasion of his stay there on his day of invisibility prior to the beginning of each new month demonstrates that the divine powers that decided over the future of the dead in the netherworld did not meet daily.</page><page sequence="25">THE SUN AT NIGHT AND THE DOORS OF HEAVEN 151 enough to brighten the darkness of the area beneath the western horizon, dimming subsequently to a degree that it can no longer be regarded as daylight. As it nears the eastern horizon it is fanned to flame again by the morning breeze.61 The reconstruction of this cycle rests basically on the interpretation of the term nap't4u, "to flare up," as applied to the rising of luminous heavenly bodies and the darkness encountered by Gilgames on the "road of Samag." The notion of an unchangingly luminescent sun is unlikely but cannot be ruled out. Possibly the most significant result of the present study is the establish- ment of the concept of heaven's interior as the invisible part of heaven below the earth. This concept implies the belief that the sun and the other heavenly bodies remained at all times in heaven and did not pass into the realm of the earth upon setting. The concept of heaven's interior in combination with the concept of the restless sun may be seen as important in the evolution of the recognition of the spherical shape of the heavens. There exists, for the time being, no indication that such recognition occurred within the frame of Babylonian culture.62 61. Ptolemy ridicules, and thereby attests the ubiquity of, the similar, if less sophisticated, view that the luminous heavenly bodies were extinguished by the western and kindled by the eastern horizon (Almagest I 3). 62. Ptolemy attributes the recognition of the spherical shape of the sky as a matter of fact to the "old ones." One wonders whether the Babylonian astronomers did not share this view, even if it is certainly true that Babylonian astronomy could have "operated without any model of a spherical universe," something which Neugebauer assumed as fact (A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy 1 348).</page></plain_text>
