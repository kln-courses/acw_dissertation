There is a very interesting phenomenon which takes place in philosophy. Theories which appeared ten or fifteen years ago in the literature of, say, the philosophy of language or the philosophy of mind, often make a reappear? ance in current discussions of problems in the philosophy of religion. As Yogi Berra once remarked, ' It's d?j? vu all over again'. However, there is always a possibility that the transition from the earlier context to the later one will be less than smooth. For sometimes the theory reappears in a slightly dis? torted form, and, as a result, its bearing on the current discussion is somewhat misconceived. In this paper, an example of this phenomenon, and its po? tential problems, will be considered. Our purpose is not, of course, to discourage such intra-disciplinary dialogue in philosophy of religion, but rather to recommend that it be undertaken with a considerable measure of care. 1 In chapter eleven of his recent book, Eternal God: A Study of God Without Time, Paul Helm considers a problem which he labels ' the dilemma of theological reference'.1 The dilemma is inspired by several of Anthony Flew's objections to the intelligibility of theistic discourse. As Helm formulates it, the dilemma is that Either ' God ' is defined in terms of a set of essential properties, in which case it appears to be impossible ever to identify God empirically, or 'God' is defined in terms of a set of empirically identifiable states of affairs, in which case a reductionist or anthropomorphic account of God is inevitable, (p. 203) If one takes the first horn, 'God' will be defined in terms of a set of attributes (incorporeality, omniscience, etc.) which consist either of negations or of attributes never directly present in empirical experience. Such a definition will, as a result, be 'empty', for one will not be able to simply point at some object in one's sensory field of experience, and say ' This is what " God " refers to'. On the other hand, if one takes the second horn, 'God' will be defined in terms of something 'directly present'. Flew considers the example of someone who might suggest that ' statements concerning God you construe as statements about the carpenter's son [Jesus of Nazareth] '.2 A first-century 1 Paul Helm, Eternal God: A Study of God Without Time (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1988), pp. 195-217. 2 Anthony Flew, God &amp; Philosophy (New York: Dell Publishing Co., 1966), p. 33.</page><page sequence="2">46 DAVID A. WHITE follower of Jesus, perhaps, could point at Jesus when asked to define 'God'. But, as Helm reports, ' Flew evidently thinks that if God is to be identified only by means of the relations into which he enters then God is identical with the sum of these relations' (pp. 202-3). And thus, 'God' would, in Flew's example, mean merely ' that certain first-century individual who I am point? ing at'. The theist could not then specify how God was anything more than simply that particular 'directly present' phenomenon. Since most traditional theists would be uncomfortable with taking either alternative, Flew con? cludes that it is impossible to give an adequate definition of ' God ' and hence, that ' God ' is a term which no one can use to successfully refer. How, then should a theist respond to Flew? In his reply to Flew, Helm attempts to avoid both horns of the dilemma, to show how the theist can give an adequate definition of ' God ' and to provide 'a theory of reference which incorporates a means of actually identi? fying what is referred to ... ' (p. 201). He explains that he will be 'treating "God" as a proper name, using Saul Kripke's account of proper names' (p. 203). Helm formulates three theses, two of which, he contends, come from Saul Kripke's 1970 lectures 'Naming and Necessity'.3 The first thesis, sup? plied by Kripke, is that a crucial distinction must be made concerning proper names and definite descriptions. Helm explains that Proper names are what Kripke calls rigid designators. They express a property had by the individual named in any possible world in which that individual exists_By contrast non-rigid or accidental designators are true of an individual in only some, at least one, of the possible worlds in which* that individual exists. Thus definite descriptions are accidental designators, (pp. 203-4) According to Helm's account of Kripke, both a proper name, like ' Nixon ' and a definite description, like 'the U.S. president in 1970', denote (or pick out) an individual. Helm also says that proper names pick out a property had by the individual denoted by that name in every possible world in which that individual exists whereas accidental designators pick out a property had in only some worlds in which that individual exists, (p. 204) It would appear, then, that 'Nixon' expresses an essential property of Nixon, whereas 'the president in 1970' expresses an accidental property of Nixon. The possible worlds terminology which Helm employs here merely illustrates the truth that although it is possible that Nixon might not have been president in 1970, it is not possible that Nixon might not have been Nixon. The second thesis, which Kripke also contributes, is that there is a crucial distinction which should be made between 'naming' (or 'giving the mean? ing') and 'fixing the reference'. Helm explains that 3 Saul Kripke, 'Naming and Necessity', in Semantics of Matural Language, ed. Donald Davidson &amp; Gilbert Harman (Boston: D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1972), pp. 253-355 (hereafter, Semantics of Matural Language). Following Helm's practice, page references will be to this edition.</page><page sequence="3">KRIPKE AT THE HELMT 47 Normally the names of individuals are learned by means of a definite description or set of such descriptions. In Kripke's view the function of such definite descriptions is to fix the reference of the individual named, (p. 205) For example, a friend might mention the name 'James White'. If you didn't know him you might ask 'Who is that?'. And the friend might offer you the definite description ' the fellow standing to your right, who is telling the joke'. Here the definite description serves to 'fix the reference' of the name for the hearer. However, if you asked your friend to 'give the meaning' of the name 'James White', your friend would be in error to reply 'the fellow standing to your right, who is telling the joke'. That is, what 'fixes the reference' of a proper name is not necessarily the same as what ' gives the meaning ' of a proper name. This is, Helm contents, also the case for 'God'. What does 'give the meaning' of the proper name 'God'? Helm's answer to this question involves a third thesis, which he acknowledges to be his own addition to Kripke's views. The thesis is that the 'meaning' or definition of the proper name 'God' consists of God's 'individual essence' or as Helm puts it, '"God" expresses the individual essence of God' (p. 208). God's 'individual essence', Helm explains, 'consists in a set of properties some of which are shareable (other individuals than God may have them) but the set of which is unique to him' (p. 208). On this view, some properties in the set are 'shareable' ones, and others in the set are 'individual essential proper? ties', which Helm describes as ' properties which are essential to an individual which no other individual could have' (p. 208). And Helm makes the further remark that 'Each of God's individual essential properties may be said to form an individual essence of God, and the set of his individual essential properties to form the individual essence of God' (p. 208).4 Now with these three theses in hand, Helm formulates his reply to Flew's dilemma. First, one can use, Helm contends, 'contingent' or 'accidental' definite descriptions to 'fix the reference' of 'God' without committing oneself to the view that these definite descriptions 'give the meaning' of ' God '. To use Helm's examples, Moses could have given the definite descrip? tions 'the one who made the bush burn', or 'the one who led the children of Israel out of Egypt' to 'fix the reference' of'God' (p. 211). While the reference of'God' is fixed here by 'empirically identifiable states of affairs', Helm denies that such 'states of affairs' constitute the 'meaning' of'God'. This enables one, in a sense, to 'identify' God 'empirically', and yet to block the reductionist move in the second horn of Flew's dilemma, which would reduce God to being merely one or more of these ' empirically identifiable states of affairs'. Secondly, since 'God' is, as a proper name, a 'rigid designator', one should define or 'give the meaning' of'God' by isolating the 'essential' property (or properties) which it expresses. After careful 4 Helm seems to want to have it both ways in his account of God's 'individual essence'. Does the set of properties which comprises the 'individual essence' of God contain 'shareable' properties or not?</page><page sequence="4">48 DAVID A. WHITE reflection, one will arrive at a set of these 'essential' properties - God's 'individual essence'. This 'individual essence' constitutes the 'meaning' of ' God ' and enables one to identify God in the following sense, namely, ' to give the set of properties which is possessed by one individual and by no other' (p. 202). Thus, Helm argues, one can, in the end, give an adequate definition of ' God ' involving a set of essential properties even though the reference of'God' is fixed by means of accidental or contingent properties. 11 There are, unfortunately, some difficulties involved in Helm's charac? terization of Kripke's views, and also, in his understanding of the bearing of Kripke's views on 'the dilemma of theological reference'. The initial diffi? culty involves Helm's statement that according to Kripke's account, 'They [proper names] express a property had by the individual named in any possible world in which that individual exists' (p. 203). The fact is that Kripke, in 'Naming and Necessity', never actually says that proper names 'express' properties. Although he does maintain, in at least one passage, that there is a connection between proper names and essential properties, Kripke refrains from unequivocally affirming the view that proper names ' express ' properties, essential or otherwise.5 In fact, there is only one passage where Kripke even comes close to affirming something similar to this. While discussing general terms, Kripke says Perhaps some 'general' names ('foolish', 'fat', 'yellow') express properties. In a significant sense, such general names as 'cow' and 'tiger' do not, unless being a. cow counts trivially as a property. Certainly 'cow' and 'tiger' are not short for the conjunction of properties a dictionary would take to define them, as Mill thought.6 This is, at most, a tepid endorsement of the thesis that ' some general names express trivial properties' and, except for brief mention in two footnotes (nos. 66 and 71), the only passage in the text of ' Naming and Necessity ' where the thesis that 'general' names 'express' properties is even mentioned.7 Moreover, there is at least one passage in ' Naming and Necessity ' which clearly rules out the view that proper names 'express' a certain kind of property. In a passage from his third lecture, Kripke endorses John Stuart Mill's view that proper names have denotations, but not connotations. That is, Kripke endorses the view that proper names denote (or pick out) the objects to which they refer, but do not connote (or express) 'identifying' or 'defining' properties. He states: The modern logical tradition, as represented by Frege and Russell, disputed Mill on the issue of singular names, but endorsed him on that of general names. Thus all 5 Semantics of Matural Language, pp. 269-70. 6 Ibid. p. 322. 7 Ibid.</page><page sequence="5">KRIPKE AT THE HELM? 49 terms, both singular and general, have a 'connotation' or Fregean sense? The present view [Kripke's own], directly reversing Frege and Russell, endorses Mill's view o? singular terms, but disputes his view o? general terms.8 For Kripke, the 'connotation' (or 'Fregean sense') of a term, such as, say, 'human being', is 'a conjunction of certain properties which give necessary and sufficient conditions for humanity...';9 or as he says elsewhere, 'the conjunction of certain properties which pick out their [the term's] exten? sion'.10 In the passage about the 'modern logical tradition', Kripke holds that neither singular terms nor most general terms have (or express) these 'connotations'. And if one considers the 'meanings' or 'definitions' of terms to consist of their 'connotations' or as Kripke says, 'the conjunction of properties which give necessary and sufficient conditions' for their appli? cation, Kripke would deny that proper names have such 'meanings' or 'definitions'!11 A careful interpreter of Kripke's views on proper names is faced, then, with an ambiguous situation. For some of Kripke's remarks connect proper names and essential properties, and seem to imply that ' proper names express essential properties'. But Kripke himself does not affirm this thesis outright, and, furthermore, denies that proper names have (or express) 'connotations' (or 'Fregean senses'). Unfortunately, Helm does not recognize that he is offering an interpretation, and not merely a report, when he says that, for Kripke, 'They [proper names] express a property...' (p. 203). It is not implausible to think that what Helm has done here is to mistakenly conflate some of the views of another philosopher, Alvin Plantinga, with the views of Saul Kripke. There are two pieces of evidence for such a hypothesis. One is that, in chapter eleven, Helm mentions Plantinga in a footnote while discussing 'individual essential properties'. So he is certainly familiar with one of Plantinga's writings.12 The other reason is that, in the particular text which Helm footnotes, Plantinga explicitly affirms the following thesis: 'proper names, therefore, do indeed express properties. They express proper? ties of a very special sort: essences [or individual essences]'.13 8 Ibid. p. 327. See also p. 322. There has been some debate concerning Mill's position. See Michael Lockwood 'On Predicating Proper Names', Philosophical Review lxxxiv (October, 1975), 471-98. 9 Ibid. p. 322. 10 Ibid. p. 327. 11 Ibid. p. 322. However, Kripke does not, in 'Naming and Necessity', deny the general thesis that 'proper names have a "sense"'. For 'sense' can be defined in several diff?rent ways. See Nathan Salmon, Reference and Essence (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1981), pp. 11-14. Note that I am not maintaining that Helm's thesis that 'proper names express properties' is itself inconsistent with Kripke's views on proper names. What I am maintaining is that Helm is incorrect to think that Kripke affirms that 'proper names express properties' in the three lectures contained in 'Naming and Necessity*. 12 Helm, Eternal God, p. 208. It is odd, then, that Helm does not credit Plantinga with the prior formulation and defence of the general thesis that 'proper names express essences'. Helm's innovation, and central contribution, involves, not his formulation of this general thesis, but rather his application of this thesis to the case of the specific proper name, 'God'. 13 Alvin Plantinga, The Mature of Mecessity (Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1974), pp. 70-81. See also his 'The Boethian Compromise', American Philosophical Quarterly xv (April, 1978), 129-38, and his</page><page sequence="6">5? DAVID A. WHITE III There is, however, a further difficulty with Helm's characterization of Kripke's views on proper names. It involves the omission of some important aspects of Kripke's view, which, as it turns out, have some significance for Helm's dispute with Anthony Flew. The first of these neglected aspects is found in the second lecture in 'Naming and Necessity', where Kripke describes, and then argues against, what he calls a 'description' theory of the reference of proper names.14 The 'description' theory involves a certain 'picture' of how successful reference, by means of a proper name, occurs. Kripke describes the ' picture ' as follows : I want to name an object. I think of some way of describing it [the object] uniquely and then I go through, so to speak, a sort of mental ceremony : [for example] By 'Cicero' I shall mean the man who denounced Cataline; and that's what the reference of 'Cicero' will be_ [My] intentions are given by first, giving some condition which uniquely determines an object, then using a certain word as a name for the object determined by these conditions.15 According to such a ' picture ', anyone who uses a proper name to successfully refer to an object must, first, 'uniquely' determine (or identify) the object they are referring to, either by means of an ostensi?n or by means of a 'uniquely identifying' definite description (hereafter, 'identifying' descrip? tion). Such ostensions and/or 'identifying' descriptions must pick out that, and only that, particular object. Furthermore, according to the 'description' theory, if one does not have an ostensi?n and/or 'identifying' description for a particular object, then one cannot refer to that object by means of a proper name. Now Kripke responds to the 'description' theory of the reference of proper names by denying that its 'picture' is true in all cases of successful reference, and also, by presenting his own alternative 'picture'. In his second lecture, Kripke presents several different cases involving someone referring success? fully to an object by means of a proper name even though the person does not have (and thus, cannot provide for someone else) an ostensi?n or an 'identifying' description.16 One of his cases involves someone, a non-academic sort of person, who has heard of the famous physicist, Richard Feynman, and who uses the proper name, 'Richard Feynman', to refer to this individual.17 Suppose that you asked that person if he/she had an 'identifying' description of Feynman, or if he/she could point him out to you. And suppose that the person could only tell you that Feynman was a physicist or that he was a famous physicist. discussion of Kripke in Profiles : Alvin Plantinga, ed. James E. Tomberlin and Peter van Inwagen (Boston: D. Reidel Publishing Co., 1985), pp. 76-87. It might be added that Plantinga is himself somewhat puzzled as to what Kripke's views are on these matters. 14 Semantics of Matural Language, pp. 284-308. 15 Ibid. pp. 290-1. 16 Ibid. pp. 291-8. 17 Ibid. pp. 292, 298-9.</page><page sequence="7">KRIPKE AT THE HELM? 51 Neither of these descriptions are ' identifying ' descriptions, for they pick out other persons as well as Feynman. Suppose, furthermore, that this person could not pick Feynman out, by an ostensi?n, because he/she didn't know what Feynman looked like. A 'description' theorist, on Kripke's view, must say that in this case the person could not successfully refer by means of this proper name. However, Kripke thinks that such a response is highly counter? intuitive. Surely the person in question does successfully refer to Feynman despite his/her slender knowledge of facts about him. Moreover, Kripke contends, in quite a few cases people do refer successfully with proper names for which they cannot provide ostensions or 'identifying' descriptions (es? pecially in the cases of a famous and historically distant personage, such as, for example, 'Cicero'). If this is the case, the 'picture' of successful reference provided by the 'description' theory must be jettisoned. The second aspect of Kripke's views on proper names, which Helm neg? lects, concerns an alternative ' picture ' of the conditions for successful ref? erence.18 On Kripke's alternative 'picture', the life of a particular 'token' of a proper name can be charted on a sort of a time-line. There are at least two important events to be charted, namely, (i) the 'initial baptism' of the 'token' proper name and (2) its transmission to others through a 'chain of communication'. The 'initial baptism' takes place early in the life of the ' token ' proper name, and is performed by a particular person or persons, the 'baptizers'. Kripke uses the example of a couple who have just had a new baby.19 In performing the 'initial baptism', they specify that which they want to name, this particular child, and then annex a particular 'token' proper name, for example, a 'token' of the name 'Rebecca Ann Adams', to the child. Notice that Kripke, here, gives what has been labelled a 'descrip? tion theory of name introduction'.20 For to have specified that which they were naming, the parents must have previously identified the object (in this case, the child) either by ostensi?n or by 'identifying' description. So Kripke thinks that the ' initial baptism ' or ' introduction ' of a proper name does require that the 'baptizer' have an ostensi?n or 'identifying' description.21 However, on Kripke's view, things are quite different after a 'token' proper name has been 'baptized' or 'introduced'. To follow Kripke's ex? ample, after the parents name their new child, they will communicate this new name to their friends and acquaintances, who will, in turn, share it with others. Such a procedure forms a ' chain of communication', as the new name is transmitted from one person to the next. One might call the people (other than the 'baptizers') comprising the links in the chain, the 'receivers' of the 18 Kripke declines to provide a 'theory' or a 'set of necessary and sufficient conditions' in his lectures. Rather, he simply sketches an alternative ' picture ' which includes some of the necessary conditions for successful reference. See Semantics of Matural Language, pp. 300-1, 303. 19 Ibid. pp. 298-9. 20 Howard Wettstein, Has Semantics Rested on a Mistake? And Other Essays (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1991), p. 223. 21 Semantics of Matural Language, p. 302. See also p. 349 n. 42.</page><page sequence="8">52 DAVID A. WHITE proper name. As each new 'receiver' learns the name, 'Rebecca Ann Adams', he/she must 'fix its reference'. This the 'receiver' does either by ostensi?n or by definite description. Kripke adds the further requirement that each ' receiver of the name must, I think, intend when he learns it [the new name] to use it with the same reference as the man from whom he heard it'.22 But it is important to note that, on Kripke's account, a 'receiver' could use the proper name, 'Rebecca Ann Adams', to refer successfully to her despite not being able to identify her by ostensi?n or by 'identifying' de? scription. For perhaps the 'receiver' has never actually seen Rebecca, and has fixed the reference of this name by the definite description, ' the daughter of Ed Adams', a description which, unfortunately, picks out two persons, Ed Adams' two daughters, 'Rebecca Ann' and 'Patricia Lynn'. Complications aside, Kripke would say that just as long as this 'receiver' intends to use the name with the same reference as the person from whom they heard it and has 'fixed the reference' of the name by an ostensi?n or a definite description, the 'receiver' can refer successfully to her using the proper name 'Rebecca Ann Adams'.23 Neither of these aspects of Kripke's view are acknowledged by Helm. In fact, Helm's entire treatment of the semantics of the proper name 'God' leaves it quite unclear whether or not he believes that anyone who uses the proper name 'God' to refer successfully to God, must have (or be able to provide) an ostensi?n or an 'identifying' description. He does not distinguish, as Kripke does, between the initial 'baptizer' of a proper name and the ' receiver' ofthat proper name. Nor does Helm assert that it is only the initial 'baptizer' who needs to have an ostensi?n or an 'identifying' description. Helm's reply to Flew does make a creative use of some of the other important aspects of Kripke's view, namely, Kripke's distinction between rigid and non rigid designators, as well as his distinction between 'giving the meaning' and 'fixing the reference' of a name. But Kripke's arguments against the 'de? scription' theory of the reference of proper names and Kripke's reformulated ' picture ' of how successful reference occurs are equally important aspects of his overall view. Their omission seriously distorts an adequate charac? terization of Kripke's views by someone who claims to be utilizing ' Saul Kripke's account of proper names' (p. 203). IV Furthermore, had Helm not neglected these two aspects of Kripke's view, he could have given his reader a much more accurate impression of the signifi? cance of Kripke's ' account of proper names' for his dispute with Flew. Some of the significance of Kripke's views are conveyed, I think, by considering the 22 Ibid. 23 Kripke notes some possible complications in a later edition of 'Naming and Necessity'. See his Maming and Mecessity (Harvard, MA: Harvard University Press, 1981), p. 163.</page><page sequence="9">KRIPKE AT THE HELM? 53 following scenario. Suppose that someone did accept the two neglected aspects of Kripke's view as well as Helm's three theses on proper names. One might label such a person a 'full-fledged Helmian'. What would a dispute between a 'full-fledged Helmian' and Flew look like? A 'full-fledged Helmian' would, I think, have some important questions to ask concerning Flew's 'dilemma of theological reference'. First, does Flew's dilemma presuppose the 'description' theory's 'picture' of how suc? cessful reference must occur? That is, does Flew's dilemma presuppose, as a sort of general principle, that everyone ('baptizers' and 'receivers') who uses a proper name to refer successfully to an object must themselves have an ostensi?n or 'identifying' description which denotes (or picks out) that, and only that, object? If either of these questions are answered affirmatively, the ' full-fledged Helmian' would, then, employ Kripke's arguments against the 'description' theory's 'picture' of the conditions for successful reference. And such a person would argue that a ' receiver ' of the proper name ' God ' does not have to have (or be able to provide) an ostensi?n or an 'identifying' description in order to be able to refer successfully to God. A ' receiver' need only ( i ) intend to use the proper name ' God ' as did the person from whom they received the name and (2) 'fix the reference' of'God' by means of either an ostensi?n or a definite description. Would taking such a course defeat Flew's 'dilemma'? No. It would simply require Flew to restate the 'dilemma' in a more nuanced manner so as to avoid a commitment to a general principle based upon the 'description' theory's 'picture' of successful reference. A careful restatement of the 'dilemma' would, I think, focus upon the situation of the 'baptizer' of the proper name 'God'. For it remains true, even if one follows Kripke's 'picture' of the conditions for successful reference, that a 'baptizer' of the name 'God', must specify the object to which she is annexing the 'token' of the proper name. And this specification, to be successful, must involve either an ostensi?n or an 'identifying' description. Although he doesn't speak in these terms, Flew's dilemma would, I think, be best reformulated into a denial of the possibility of anyone successfully performing an act of'initial baptism' using the proper name 'God'. Flew might argue that such an act would always fail, for an 'initial baptism' presupposes that the 'baptizer' can, prior to the 'baptism' specify the object he/she is referring to by either an ostensi?n or an 'identifying' description. And Flew also might argue that neither ostensions nor 'identifying' descrip? tions (with sufficient 'empirical' content) would be available in this case. Ultimately, the debate between the 'full-fledged Helmian' and Flew would centre on the following question: 'Is it possible for anyone to "introduce" successfully by "initial baptism", the proper name "God"?'. The 'full-fledged Helmian' would, of course, answer this question affirma? tively. Such a person would be free to utilize the ideas and arguments</page><page sequence="10">54 DAVID A. WHITE presented by Helm in his initial response to Flew. That is, the 'full-fledged Helmian' would offer a defence of a 'baptizer's' ability to 'introduce' the proper name 'God' by, first, arguing that one can use 'contingent' or 'accidental' definite descriptions to 'fix the reference' of 'God' without committing oneself to the view that these definite descriptions 'give the meaning' of'God'. And second, the 'full-fledged Helmian' would argue that the 'meaning' or 'definition' of 'God' can be given by isolating the 'essential' property (or properties) which it expresses, which will be, God's 'individual essence'. The scenario which has been sketched in these last few paragraphs pro? vides a more accurate impression of the full import of ' Saul Kripke's account of proper names ' for the dispute between Helm and Flew. However, one is left with an important, and as yet, unanswered, question for Helm - 'Does he accept this "full-fledged Helmian" position or not?'.24 Department of Philosophy, Marquette University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53233 24 I would like to thank Michael J.
