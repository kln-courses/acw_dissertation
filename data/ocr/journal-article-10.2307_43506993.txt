The accumulated data clearly demonstrate that Sha'ar Hagolan was a major Neolithic settlement in numerous respects. Its large size (20 hectares) renders it one of the largest known Neolithic sites in the Near East. The dwellings are large building complexes, each occupying several hundred square meters and introducing a new type of architecture (the courtyard house), a building concept still prevalent today in traditional Near Eastern societies. The transition to permanent settlements in the Neolithic period of the ancient Near East brought with it dramatic changes in the development of architecture. The earliest structures were round. In the next stage, rectilinear buildings were constructed, consisting at first of a single room, then of several rooms. The earliest occurrence of a third stage of development is seen in the courtyard houses of Sha'ar Hagolan, lending the site its special significance in the history of architecture. In addition, Sha'ar Hagolan was a planned village with an organized network of passageways, including straight main streets that were regularly resurfaced by the inhabitants. A large assemblage of art objects was recovered at the site, including over 200 anthropomorphic figurines constituting about two thirds of the figurines discovered at all prehistoric sites in Israel. In addition, the well uncovered at the site, one of the oldest in the world, reveals sophisticated hydrological technology. These revolutionary discoveries have completely altered our understanding of the 6th millennium BCE and shed new light on the rise of urban concepts in the ancient Near East. Unearthing and publishing this historical heritage is an immense responsibility. Thus, it is our pleasure to present to our readers the second monograph in the series of publications on the renewed archaeological investigations at Sha'ar Hagolan. The first publication (Y. Garfinkel and A.M. Miller, Sha'ar Hagolan Vol.1: Neolithic Art in Context , Oxford: Oxbow, 2002) was an interim summary, comprising 19 chapters on various aspects of the results of the excavations and an overview of the site. The present volume is a classic final excavation report - a detailed, and somewhat tedious, account of the stratigraphy and architecture of the five excavation areas. As no further fieldwork is planned for the coming years, on conclusion of the excavations these areas were backfilled to the level of the current topsoil. As the stratigraphy and architecture of a site are the foundations on which the analysis of all other find categories is based, it is only natural that one of the first volumes be dedicated to these aspects. The upcoming volumes, currently in preparation, will deal with the following subjects: pottery and baked-clay objects, the flint and obsidian industries, basalt and limestone items and art objects. At a rate of one volume every two years, we anticipate that it will take at least ten years to complete the publication of our excavations at the site of Sha'ar Hagolan. Publication of the results of eleven field seasons, some of which were conducted on a very large scale, is a complex task involving the evaluation and integration of thousands of excavated units: walls, floors, inställations, pits, fills, debris, topsoil and virgin soil. To make this report as user-friendly as possible, it has been divided into three parts. Part I, composed of six chapters, presents a general picture of the excavations emphasizing the main results. Part II is more technical in nature, analyzing the stratigraphy and architecture of Areas E, F, G, H and N together with photographs, excavation plans and section drawings. The extensively excavated Area E was divided into two chapters, the first summarizing the complete stratigraphy of Area E and the second dealing in detail with the architecture of Stratum E-4, the main Yarmukian occupation. The five appendices in Part III present the archaeological data in the form of locus lists and block diagrams for each area. The locus lists are organized in sequential order, briefly outlining the basic information for each locus. At the end of each appendix is a graphic block diagram for each of the excavated squares. The successful publication of eleven excavation seasons has been achieved only due to the efforts of hundreds of people who assisted us in so many aspects: logistics, excavation, documentation, analysis and funding. We wish to express our gratitude and acknowledge these people and agencies (see below). Finally, it is an immense pleasure to dedicate this book to Prof. Ofer Bar-Yosef, our teacher, colleague and friend, from whose warm advice and support the Sha'ar Hagolan project has greatly benefited over the years.

Over 500 volunteers and staff were involved in the expedition over the years, and all contributed their enthusiasm and experience in the extremely hot climate of the Jordan Valley. Without their efforts, this project would have been an impossible undertaking. We are deeply grateful to all of them. Realizing such an extensive task of excavation, analysis and publication demands not only considerable human resources, but also a strong financial base. Various foundations tendered their support to the Sha'ar Hagolan project, and it is only due to their generosity that we were able to carry out the excavations, analysis and publication. • Two grants from the Israel Science Foundation founded by the Israel Academy of Sciences and the Humanities • The Beracha Foundation • The Curtiss T. and Mary G.

This culture was first defined in the late 1940s by M. Stekelis, following his pioneer excavation at the site. He recognized the unique character of the flint industry, pottery and art objects, and named the culture after the nearby Yarmuk River (Stekelis 1 95 1 ). In his preliminary publications of Sha'ar Hagolan, Stekelis pointed out the most characteristic features of the material culture: pottery decorated with incised herringbone patterns, sickle blades fashioned with coarse denticulation, and a rich assemblage of art objects, including large numbers of schematic anthropomorphic pebble figurines. 2 Surveys and excavations have shown that the site extends over some 20 hectares, making it one of the largest known settlements of its time. 3 The excavations uncovered three large courtyard houses, ranging between 250 and 700 sq. m. in area. Construction on such a scale is unknown elsewhere in this period. 4 The houses consist of a central courtyard surrounded by several small rooms. This is the first appearance of an architectural concept that still exists today in traditional Mediterranean societies, lending Sha'ar Hagolan its special importance in the history of architecture. 5 The houses were separated by streets , providing evidence of advanced communal planning. The excavation uncovered three passageways, including a central street about 3 m. wide, paved with pebbles set in mud, a street 2 m. wide paved with hard, thick mud plaster, and a narrow winding alley 1 m. wide. These are the earliest streets discovered in Israel, and among the earliest known streets in the ancient Near East. 6 A well, 4.26 m. deep, was dug down to the water table; it is indicative of advanced hydrological knowledge and engineering. 7 The greatest technological innovation during the period of Sha'ar Hagolan was the manufacture of pottery, hence the name of this cultural stage, the Pottery Neolithic period. The pottery vessels appear in a variety of shapes and sizes and were used in assorted domestic tasks. 8 Exotic imported objects discovered in the excavations, including seashells from the Mediterranean, vessels made of polished alabaster, and obsidian blades from Turkey, reveal the existence of trade connections extending over hundreds of kilometers. 9 Approximately 300 art objects were found at Sha'ar Hagolan, making it the main center of prehistoric art in Israel and one of the most important in the ancient Near East. One of the houses yielded about 70 figurines made of both stone and fired clay. No other single building of the Neolithic period has yielded so many figurines. 10 Among the outstanding art objects of Sha'ar Hagolan are anthropomorphic figurines made of fired clay or carved on pebbles. The overwhelming majority are female images, interpreted as representing a goddess. The clay figurines are extravagant in their detail, lending them a surrealistic appearance, while the pebble figurines are minimalist and abstract in form. Due to the unique artistic qualities of the Sha'ar Hagolan figurines, both the Louvre Museum in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum in New York have mounted five-year exhibits of ten and twenty objects respectively. In Israel, Sha'ar Hagolan figurines are permanently exhibited at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem and the Eretz-Israel Museum in Tel Aviv, while the Bible Lands Museum in Jerusalem held a special exhibition devoted to Sha'ar Hagolan in 1999. Though we do not know the language spoken by the prehistoric inhabitants of Sha'ar Hagolan, we may have one word in common with them: the name of the river Yarmuk. The three main rivers of Israel, the Jordan (Yarden in Hebrew), the Yarkon and the Yarmuk, all begin with the syllable "Yar". The biblical river in Jordan, the Jabbok (Yabbok in Hebrew, Wadi ez-Zerqa in Arabic), may have originally been called Yarbok. These names have no meaning in the known ancient Semitic languages and may possibly preserve a remnant of an earlier language. Settlements whose culture is identical to that of Sha'ar Hagolan have been revealed on the banks of each of these rivers: Munhata and Hamadiya beside the Jordan, Bashan Street in Tel Aviv beside the Yarkon, and Abu Thawwab beside the Jabbok. The names of the rivers have perhaps survived for 8000 years, and it may even be that these prehistoric people called themselves "people of the Yarmuk", just as modern researchers call their culture "the Yarmukian Culture". The excavation of Sha'ar Hagolan has completely altered our understanding of the Pottery Neolithic period in the Southern Levant, providing the earliest known dates for the 3</page><page sequence="28">CHAPTER 1 evolution of urban planning. What was previously considered an era of decline has proved to be a time of cultural innovation in the Levant (for further discussion of these aspects, see Garfinkel and Miller 2002, Sha ' ar Hagolan 1 : Neolithic Art in Context , Oxford; hereafter SHI). HISTORY OF RESEARCH The Neolithic village of Sha'ar Hagolan is located in the central Jordan Valley, 1 .5 km. south of the Sea of Galilee, at an elevation of ca. 210 m. below sea level (Israel map reference 20690-23 150/20750-23200). The site lies on the northwestern bank of the Yarmuk River, near the common border of three modern states: Israel, Jordan and Syria. Sha'ar Hagolan is the type-site for the Pottery Neolithic Yarmukian culture, which was dispersed over large parts of the Mediterranean climatic zone of Israel, Jordan and Lebanon (Fig. 1.1). The site was discovered by members of the nearby Kibbutz Sha'ar Hagolan during the construction of fishponds in the early 1940s. The late Prof. Moshe Stekelis of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem conducted five excavation seasons here in 1949-1952 (Stekelis 195 1 , 1952). His excavations were carried out in four different locations (Areas A-D), all of them several hundred meters from the Yarmuk River bank (Fig. 1 .2). Stekelis published the final excavation report in Hebrew in 1966 and in English in 1972. In 1989, 37 years after Stekelis completed his explorations at the site, excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan were renewed. The new excavations were directed by Yosef Garfinkel on behalf of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. During the 1998-2000 seasons, Michele A. Miller served as co-director. Eleven excavation seasons took place in 1989-1990 and 1996-2004, and nearly 3000 sq. m. were unearthed. In 1988, Miller conducted an extensive surface survey and tested soil samples from some 30 trenches dug illegally by local farmers. Miller's study indicates that the extent of the Pottery Neolithic settlement at Sha'ar Hagolan reached ca. 20 hectares (Miller 2002), one of the largest Neolithic sites known in the Near East. Our excavations have explored the nature of this settlement in five different areas of the site, referred to as Areas E-H (continuing the sequence begun by Stekelis) and Area N (on the small tell of Abu Nimmel) (Fig. 1 :2, Table 1.1). AREA E Excavations in this area began in 1989 and continued through to the 2003 season, by which time a total horizontal area of ca. 1700 sq. m. had been uncovered. Two complete large-scale building complexes and parts of three others were exposed. Below the massive Pottery Neolithic architecture, an earlier Neolithic phase was uncovered, that of the recently defined Pre- Pottery Neolithic C (Rollefson 1989). A detailed description of the architecture of Area E is the main focus of this publication. At the end of the 2003 season, the area was backfilled. AREA F This area lies 450 m to the northeast of Area E. Two small test pits excavated in 1998 revealed substantial architectural features, including stone wall foundations (one measuring nearly 1 m. in Fig. 1.1. Distribution of Pottery Neolithic sites in the southern Levant. width) and a partly preserved, hard-packed, whitish clay floor. By the end of the 1998 season, the two test pits were backfilled and a banana grove was planted above them. AREA G This is a stratigraphie trench, 20 x 5 m. (100 sq. m.), located ca. 100 m. northeast of Area E, which cuts through 4 I *Horvat Uza I J / Sea of] [ 'Galilee' =) .YHtatiel 'j=ģ y-xguM =NevëhVâm?'

An additional 5 X 5 m. square was excavated in the northwestern corner. During three seasons (1999, 2000, 2002), a full sequence of Yarmukian accumulation, ca. 3 m. deep, was completely exposed. Below this, a few Pre-Pottery Neolithic C remains were revealed. This is the first time that such a detailed stratigraphie sequence of the Yarmukian Culture has been uncovered, since Yarmukian sites do not usually contain thick deposits. At the bottom of the trench, a circular well built of large basalt pebbles was found dug into virgin soil. It descends 4.26 m . to the current water table. At the end of the 2003 season the area was backfilled. AREA H This is the second largest horizontal exposure of the renewed excavations, located about 200 m. northwest of Area E. It was excavated for three seasons ( 1 999 , 2000 , 2003) , and a total area of ca. 700 sq. m. was opened. At least two Yarmukian phases could be discerned in the architectural features here. While the upper one is badly damaged, the lower phase is much better preserved. The architecture in Area H is similar in construction to that of Area E, including walls with stone foundations and mudbrick superstructures. The northern half of Area H appears to have consisted of an extensive building complex with a large central courtyard surrounded by 10 rooms. A street running in an east- west direction was located north of the building. Small segments of at least four additional building complexes were uncovered on either side of the street. AREA N (TELL ABU NIMMEL) Area N was thus named because it is situated on a small local tell whose Arabic name is Tell Abu Nimmel, about 400 m. from Area E on the eastern edge of the site. One excavation season, in which 200 sq. m., were opened took place here in 2004. Only meager architectural remains were found in this area, which functioned mainly as an open space. LOCATION AND SETTING Sha'ar Hagolan is located in the Jordan Rift Valley within the geographical unit of the Kinrot Valley (Karmon 1971: 163), which comprises Lake Kinneret (the Sea of Galilee) and a triangular region to the south, between the Jordan and Yarmuk Rivers (Color Plates I). To the east, this unit is bordered by the Golan Heights and the Mountains of Gilead, and to the west by the Mountains of Galilee (Figs 1.3-1.5). The area is rich in water sources and fertile land. A more detailed geographical description of the area, including its climatic conditions, is provided by Karmon (1971: 170; see also SHI). The Neolithic remains at Sha'ar Hagolan extend over approximately 20 hectares (Miller 2002). The reason such a large community flourished in this location may be attributed to its location in the Jordan Rift Valley, at the delta where the Yarmuk River joins the Jordan River from the east. Most Neolithic sites in the Jordan Valley are situated similarly- adjacent to a tributary where it enters the valley (Tzori 1958: 51), for example the site of Gesher (PPNA), Tel 'Ali (PPNB, PPNC), Munhata (PPNB, Yarmukian) and Hamadiya/'Ain Fig. 1 .3 .

The traditional explanation for this pattern is the advantages offered by alluvial fans for agriculture (Prausnitz 1959; Bar-Yosef 1992a: 15). The Yarmuk is the largest of the local rivers in the region, creating the widest delta in the Southern Levant, thus providing a greater carrying capacity than any other river, further explanation for the development here of one of the largest Neolithic sites in the ancient Near East. The delta of the Yarmuk is located north of the river. The site of Sha'ar Hagolan is located on the northern bank of the river close to the southern edge of the delta. This location offered the inhabitants easy access to their fields, with no need to cross the river. The site is situated as far as possible from the river mouth, as the Yarmuk River often overflows its banks after heavy rains. As these conditions were also favorable for all stages of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic, there are probably other large pre-pottery sites buried in the Yarmuk River delta, waiting to be discovered. One of the aims of the 2004 season was to examine the possibility that Tell Abu Nimmel (Area N) was created by early, pre-pottery Neolithic occupations. However, it became clear that this tell was a natural low hill created by accumulation of river wash. Despite the apparent lack of any 6</page><page sequence="31">INTRODUCTION Fig. 1 .4.

Location of Neolithic sites in the central Jordan Valley. pre-pottery Neolithic sites in the region, there are sites from periods slightly later than the Yarmukian, such as the Wadi Rabah culture, at Tel Dover on the Yarmuk River bank about 2 km. east of Sha'ar Hagolan (Khalaily and Kamaisky 2002) and Pithat Hayarmuk about 4 km. north of Sha'ar Hagolan (Epstein 1984). Another factor that may have played a role in the location and size of Sha'ar Hagolan is the climatic crisis that took place around 6400 BCE, when the region suffered a severe drought (Bar-Matthews et al. 1997). In such harsh conditions, the Yarmuk River's delta could have served as a refuge for populations originating in areas that suffered from increased aridity. Since river valleys also provided the most convenient transportation routes between different regions, these sites were also situated at crossroads between the north-south route created by the Jordan Valley and the east-west routes of its tributaries. The rift valley is the main north-south route in the Levant, crossing through the modern states of Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan. The Yarmuk River comprises a main east-west route from the Jordan Valley to Transjordan and the Golan Heights. This is the route followed by the Ottoman railway from Haifa to Damascus in the early part of the 20th century. Thus, Sha'ar Hagolan is located on a main junction in the Levant, where a north-south route meets an east- west route. This central location was an important factor in the development of Sha'ar Hagolan into a major Neolithic settlement. In conclusion, the location of Sha'ar Hagolan- on a riverbank, on the largest river delta in the Southern Levant, and on an important crossroads-provided many advantages, as a result of which Sha'ar Hagolan became not only the largest Neolithic settlement in the central Jordan Valley, but one of the largest in the ancient Near East. These many advantages can be summarized as follows: 1 Permanent reliable water sources for humans and animals. 2 Alluvial soil for cultivation. 3 Mud and clay deposits for various needs, including construction and pottery. 4 Marsh vegetation suitable for basketry and mat industries. 5 Supplies of basalt river pebbles for various constructions, such as rounded pebbles for wall foundations and flat pebbles for paving. 6 Availability of limestone pebbles for the schematic anthropomorphic figurines. 7 Abundance of flint pebbles, the most common material for the lithic industry. 8 Availability of aquatic fauna; no significant amount of fish bones, however, has yet been found in the excavation. SITE FORMATION PROCESSES Site formation processes can be divided into those occurring during human occupation of the site (depositional processes) and those occurring after desertion (post-depositional processes). In both these stages, natural and human factors can be observed. DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES Natural phenomena In most Neolithic sites of the Southern Levant, flint and basalt were raw materials intentionally imported and deposited at the site. Sha'ar Hagolan, however, is located at a river delta, where natural deposits of flint, basalt and limestone pebbles occur (Fig. 1.7). These river pebbles bear natural battering marks created while they were rolling in the river bed, lending them the appearance of stone tools; thus flint pebbles may resemble hammerstones, elongated basalt pebbles may look like pestles, and flat basalt pebbles may appear to be grinding stones. Hundreds, even thousands, of these items are revealed every season, apparently the accumulation of river wash at the site. A similar problem is presented by the thousands of smoothed, or even polished, flint chunks and chips that were broken off from flint pebbles, rolled and rounded by the river, and eventually deposited at the site. They do not reflect on-site flint knapping. 8 ' Sea of _ ■ f'AliX "" ' T a Galilee Sha'ar 3/ _ / f'AliX 3/ T i "" a Sha'ar j-J a Hagolan X - ^MunhataX 'JSL_ ) Gesher c WÊÊltlÊËÊÊÊË.

Human activities Depositional processes related to the inhabitants of the site include building activities and the quarrying of raw materials. The large courtyard complexes required large quantities of stones for the wall foundations and clay for the mudbrick superstructure. The bricks were usually made of whitish clay originating in the local Lisan Formation. The clay may have come from the banks of the Yarmuk River or from large pits dug between the houses. When the houses were abandoned, the mudbrick superstructure collapsed and covered the floors, installations and lower walls. This deteriorated brick sediment gives the Neolithic layer its distinct whitish color. In this context, the question of the origin of the building materials arises. If the stones and the mud for the bricks were brought from outside the site, from the nearby river bed, this would have resulted in increased accumulation at the site. If, on the other hand, mud and stones were quarried within the site, the total accumulation over the ages would have been much slower. According to the evidence at the site, a combination of these two phenomena occurred. As most of the older stone walls and pavements were not robbed, it seems probable that stones were brought from time to time from the river bed. The mudbricks, however, usually contain small pieces of freshly knapped flint rather than the Melanopsis shells common near the river. This attests to the fact that, for the most part, the mud for the bricks originated within the site. This combined strategy for acquiring building materials would explain the gradual and relatively modest accumulation at the site, in contrast to other archaeological sites where destroyed brick walls usually constitute the bulk of accumulation. The quarrying of clay and the digging of water wells or simple storage pits brought up large amounts of older deposits, including artifacts and charcoal, which consequently became mixed with more recent ones. Thus, a certain percentage of the material uncovered is older than the context in which it was found. In the same way, pits penetrating into lower levels can introduce later materials into early contexts. However, at Sha'ar Hagolan such disturbances were apparently minimal, as most of the architecture was undisturbed. Another aspect of human building activity is the repair or construction of new houses on top of older ones with little change. This can comprise renovation of a floor or pavement inside the same walls, creating a sub-phase within a given stratum. Alternatively, a new construction of a floor and walls on top of an earlier building creates a new occupation stratum at the site. The thickness of a stratum at Sha'ar Hagolan is usually no more than 0.50 m., and in several cases rather less. While the preservation of the same plan over generations has been interpreted as reflecting tradition and long-term community memory (Hodder and Cessford 2004), there may have been a more practical reason-the ownership of property. If the houses inside the settlement were inherited from generation to generation and the settlement density increased, options for changing house plans without creating conflict with surrounding neighbors were limited. Such physical conditions would impose architectural stability over time at a site. Another major aspect of the depositional process is the relation of artifacts to the architecture. The site did not suffer sudden destruction and most of the floors in the rooms were found with few artifacts upon them. The question arises, were the artifacts accumulated during the occupation of the houses or rather, did abandoned buildings become places for dumping garbage? As can be seen the in the modern Arab village of 'Uja near Jerusalem, deserted mud houses were used as garbage dumps (see Chapter 3). At Sha'ar Hagolan there is a clear pattern to the distribution of finds, most of which- pottery, flint, animal bones and figurines-were uncovered in the open courtyards, while the rooms were relatively empty. An outstanding exception is Room R in Building Complex II, where over 20 stone tools were found lying on the floor, together with a holemouth jar and a large storage jar. It would seem that the roofed rooms were constantly cleaned, while in the open courtyards occupation debris was allowed to accumulate. If the finds had accumulated in the buildings after they had gone out of use, there would be little difference between roofed and open-air spaces. It can therefore be concluded that the material in the houses derived mainly from the occupation itself. 9</page><page sequence="34">CHAPTER 1 POST-DEPOSITIONAL PROCESSES Natural phenomena Natural processes have eroded various parts of the Neolithic remains. The main natural force in the area is the Yarmuk River, whose meandering has cut into the sido'es of the banks, enlarging the flood plain and creating the river terrace. Over time, the flood plain has become wider and the terrace has been cut back. Thus, the current Yarmuk River terrace has eroded away the southeastern corner of Building Complex II in Area E (Fig. 1 .8). We have no indication as to when this event took place, but since most of the fill here consisted of old plastic irrigation pipes, it seems to have been quite a recent event. Another natural phenomenon observed in the excavated areas is an east- west gully in Areas E and G, cutting through the Neolithic layers and filled with MB I pottery. It would seem that this event took place during the 3rd millennium BCE. In Area G, where the modern-day topography descends southward toward the Yarmuk River, slope erosion was observed. The upper Neolithic remains, which are well preserved in the northern part of the area, are completely missing in the south. The depth of the Neolithic remains has had a significant effect on their state of preservation. Close to the surface, organic materials are not preserved, animal bones are covered with concretions, and the paint on pottery and figurines is much eroded. In deeper layers, the organic material, animal bones and paint on pottery and figurines are better preserved. Human activities Post-Neolithic human disturbances took place mainly during three periods. In the MB I, pits and living surfaces were cut into the Neolithic layers, and in the late medieval period, burials penetrated into Tell Abu Nimmel. However, the most extensive damage was caused in modern times, by both civilian and military activities. There are two local farming communities in the vicinity: Kibbutz Sha'ar Hagolan (in whose property Areas A-E and G-H are located) and Kibbutz Fig .1.8. Area E , the southern edge of Building Complex II eroded by the Yarmuk River terrace. Fig. 1 .9. Large stone vessels collected from the surface after deep plowing in the field east of Area G. Massada (in whose property Areas F and N are located). Modern cultivation utilizes the upper alluvial topsoil, but deep plowing often damages the Neolithic remains below. Prior to the 2000 season, deep plowing in a field east of Area G brought a number of large stone artifacts to the surface (Fig. 1.9). The dominant features of the modern landscape at Sha'ar Hagolan are the fishponds, constructed in the early 1940s on the entire western half of the site (Fig. 1 .10). The site of Sha'ar Hagolan was discovered at this time, when the upper Neolithic remains were damaged. The ponds were relatively shallow and were surrounded by earthen embankments. In the early 1990s, the fishponds went out of use (Fig. 1.11), and are now used for cultivating field crops such as wheat, barley and corn. Area E includes part of a fishpond and the area below a embankment. The best preservation was under the embankment, as here earth was accumulated rather than removed and the upper Neolithic layer remained intact. Military activities in the vicinity of Sha'ar Hagolan began during the Second World War, when the British dug an anti-tank trench to prevent a French invasion from the Golan Heights. From the walls of this trench, which is still visible today, Stekelis collected Neolithic artifacts (Stekelis 1972). This area was also the site of battles during Israel's Independence War of 1948, and since then it has been the meeting point of three states: Israel, Jordan and Syria. The dominant military installation at the site was built by the Israeli army on Tell Abu Nimmel in the 1970s; it destroyed large sections of this hill. In conclusion, the various processes of site formation have resulted in differing degrees of preservation of architectural features such as walls, installations and floors, from area to area. Generally, only the stone foundations of the walls, or sometimes also several courses of the brick superstructure, were preserved. Floor levels and debris layers in open courtyards were much richer in finds than those in roofed rooms, as inside rooms were probably cleaned continuously. There was no sudden destruction, as so often observed in historical periods . 10</page><page sequence="35">INTRODUCTION Fig. 1 .10. Fishpond south of Area E in 1989. Fig. 1.11.

Not all of the periods are represented in all nine excavation areas. Table 1.2 presents a proposed correlation between the various areas of the site. PRE-POTTERY NEOLITHIC C PERIOD This cultural phase (PPNC) was first identified at 'Ain Ghazal in Jordan (Rollefson 1989). The first indication that Sha'ar Hagolan was occupied during this period was a test pit conducted at the base of Area G in 2002, and in the 2003 season four additional soundings excavated to virgin soil in Area E verified this conclusion. The PPNC accumulation in these soundings comprised nearly 1 m. of debris rich in flint and animal bones but no pottery. No architectural remains, floors or installations were discerned here, probably due to the limited size of the test pits, or perhaps because this area was beyond the built-up part of the settlement. The PPNC is dated to ca. 7000-6400 BCE (calibrated), thus extending the history of the site to include most of the 7th millennium BCE. The earlier Neolithic phase provides comparative material for the study of cultural changes that took place at the transition from the Pre-Pottery to the Pottery Neolithic periods. Various aspects of this transition now offer the potential for detailed analyses: flint technology and typology, groundstone tools , long-distance exchange networks , and animal domestication (especially cattle and pig). A PPNC occupation was also revealed in the excavations at Tel 'Ali, located some 5 km west of Sha'ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 1994). Together, these two sites provide evidence that the central Jordan Valley was not deserted at the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, but apparently had a flourishing settlement history. POTTERY NEOLITHIC PERIOD (YARMUKIAN) This period, ca. 6400-5800 BCE (calibrated), was the focus of our research at Sha'ar Hagolan, uncovered in all nine excavation areas and reaching ca. 20 hectares in area.The dwellings, comprising large building complexes of several hundred square meters, present a new architectural form, the courtyard house, a concept still prevalent today in traditional societies of the Near East. Neolithic Sha'ar Hagolan was a planned settlement with a formal network of passageways, including straight main streets that were regularly resurfaced by the ancient inhabitants. A large assemblage of art objects was found, including over 200 anthropomorphic figurines, about two thirds of the prehistoric figurines discovered to date at prehistoric sites in Israel. The well, one of the oldest in the world, indicates sophisticated hydrological knowledge and technology. EARLY BRONZE AGE I This period is represented by a single pit in Area G, which contained a large storage jar broken in half. This jar is decorated with bands of reddish paint applied with a rough brush, a technique known as grain wash or band slip, which was common in the northern parts of Israel (Amiran 1969: 41). It is possible that this jar originally held an infant burial, although the bones have not survived. MIDDLE BRONZE AGE I In this period there was a large village at the site with rectangular structures built of mudbrick walls on stone foundations. A single building was excavated by Stekelis in Area D, but never published. A number of large pottery sherds from this excavation are stored in the study collection of the Institute of Archaeology at the Hebrew University. During one season in 1980, E. Eisenberg excavated two areas located to the west of our excavation (Eisenberg 1993). He exposed densely built rectilinear buildings with broken pottery vessels Table 1.2.

Middle Bronze Age I remains were uncovered by us in Areas E, G and H, all of them pits or open areas without architecture. ROMAN AND BYZANTINE PERIODS These periods are represented only by eroded pottery sherds scattered over the surface of Areas E and H. At Tel Dover, approximately 3 km. east of Sha'ar Hagolan, a Roman- Byzantine town was revealed (Rapuano 2001), and it is possible that inhabitants from Tel Dover cultivated land at Sha'ar Hagolan. ISLAMIC PERIOD In Area N several burials from this period were revealed. Late medieval Islamic pottery was also found scattered on the surface in Areas E and H. MODERN ACTIVITIES The site is located in the fields of two modern villages: Kibbutz Sha'ar Hagolan and Kibbutz Massada, near the Israel- Jordan border. Various modern objects have been uncovered in our excavations, mainly plastic irrigation pipes and military equipment. CHRONICLE OF THE EXCAVATIONS IN THE 2000-2004 SEASONS In the first volume of the Sha'ar Hagolan series, we presented a yearly chronicle of the excavations in 1989-90 and 1996- 1999 so that readers could follow the progress in each season (Garfinkel and Miller 2002: 14-19). Below, we complete the excavation chronicle with a short summary of the additional five seasons (2000-2004). No further excavations are planned at Sha'ar Hagolan by the present expedition. THE SEVENTH EXCAVATION SEASON (2000) This was a major excavation season involving nearly 50 participants at any given time, working in three different areas of the site. Work concentrated in Area H and six new squares were opened to the north and east. We unearthed a large part of a courtyard complex, composed of one large courtyard and a number of smaller rooms. At the end of the season, the northern and eastern parts of the complex still remained unexcavated. In Area G (the deep stratigraphie trench), we excavated about 1 m. deeper in all four squares, but virgin soil was not reached. In Area E, work continued on a minor scale and new squares were opened to the north in order to expose the northern part of Building Complex II. This was not achieved, but additional data were gathered on the complex, its northeastern corner, and the wide street bordering it on the east. A small limestone pebble figurine, with a previously unknown type of incised decoration on all four sides, was found inside a room (Fig. 1.12). THE EIGHTH EXCAVATION SEASON (2001) The security situation in Israel affected the number of overseas volunteers participating in the excavation, and this year we worked with half our usual group size. Thus, our efforts were concentrated on one excavation area, in the western part of Fig. 1.12. Two views of a limestone pebble figurine with a previously unknown type of incision. Area E, with the aim of clarifying the western and northwestern corner of Building Complex II. Excavation of this large complex began in our first season in 1989, and some work was invested here in each season thereafter. Only in this season did it become apparent that the complex measured ca. 35 x 20 m. (700 sq. m.). The complete exposure of this building complex is a unique achievement of the Sha'ar Hagolan excavations, as it is the largest known Neolithic building in the ancient Near East. During this season, nine new squares were opened to the west and north, each square measuring 5 x 5 m. (a total of 225 sq. m.). In addition, ten old squares were reopened to clarify certain details of walls and floors. A number of balks were removed before final photography to achieve a better overview of the architecture. By the end of the season, the total excavated size of Area E had reached ca. 1700 sq. m. To the assemblage of over 200 Neolithic art objects from previous years, some ten new items were added in the 2001 season. Of special importance are two complete clay figurines of the "Mother Goddess" type (Fig. 1.13), one of which has an incised herringbone pattern on the right shoulder and arm and the left leg. A male figure (Fig. 1.14) was also discovered, the first from our expedition at Sha'ar Hagolan, as well as a complete zoomorphic clay figurine (Fig. 1.15). THE NINTH EXCAVATION SEASON (2002) Unfortunately, the security situation continued to affect the number of overseas volunteers. Thus, we concentrated all our effects in Area G, and managed to reach virgin soil in all parts of the trench. In addition, a new 5 x 5 m. square was opened in the northwestern corner of Area G, where the upper layers were in a better state of preservation and additional data on the later Yarmukian occupation could be gathered. The stratigraphie sequence in Area G includes 3 m. of Pottery Neolithic Yarmukian accumulation, and below it meager remains of the PPNC, apparently an open area without any structures. In the last few days of the season, a rounded installation was uncovered, dug into virgin soil. It was built of 13</page><page sequence="38">CHAPTER 1 Fig. 1.13. Two clay figurines from Area E. large basalt river pebbles, its inner diameter ca. 0.50 m. and its outer ca. 1.2 m. Eight courses of stones were unearthed to a depth of 1 m. When excavation of this installation was concluded in the 2003 season, it became clear that it was a well. A rare object uncovered in Area G is a limestone pebble with a carefully incised cross (Fig. 1.16). A few test pits were excavated at the bottom of Area G into the virgin soil, one of them to a depth of 1 m. The virgin soil is composed of an upper layer with unsorted pebbles and other river wash sediments, representing the Yarmuk River delta. Below this, the horizontal layers of the Lisan Formation were exposed. THE TENTH EXCAVATION SEASON (2003) This season was dedicated to clarifying a number of unresolved problems in Areas E, G and H. In Area E, we attempted to establish the total thickness of occupation in this part of the site. Four deep test pits were excavated down to virgin soil, revealing an earlier period of occupation (remains of the PPNC chronological horizon) below the massive Yarmukian architecture. This was the first definitive evidence that the Yarmukian people were not the first to settle at Sha'ar Hagolan, but that the site had already been occupied some 500 years earlier. In Area G, our goal was the base of the well, whose mouth had been uncovered in the 2002 season. The strategy adopted was to excavate the well from the outside in (that is, from the side) rather than from the top down. Thus, a large pit was dug mechanically by backhoe into the virgin soil adjacent to the well. We slowly exposed, by hand, the outer wall of the well, then continued to excavate manually through the wall until we attained a cross-section of the well. The well was 4.26 m. deep and we were excited to find water at the bottom. Our aim in Area H was to outline a complete plan of the 14</page><page sequence="39">INTRODUCTION Fig. 1 .14. A male clay figure from Area E. Fig. 1 .15. A zoomorphic clay figurine from Area E. Fig. 1.16. An incised limestone pebble with a carefully carved cross from Area G. building complex, large parts of which had been previously excavated. We enlarged the excavation area by ca. 150 sq. m. to the north and east, reaching a total horizontal exposure of ca. 700 sq. m. The enclosing walls of the complex in the north and south were established and three new rooms were unearthed, one in the southeastern corner and two in the northeastern corner. By the end of the season it was clear that the complete building complex had a large open courtyard surrounded by ten rooms: four in the west, two in the south, two in the east and two in the north. Large quantities of pottery and flint were collected from the courtyard, including a small, nearly complete pottery jar decorated with the typical herringbone incisions (Fig. 1.17). Behind the enclosing wall on the north, a street 1-1.5 m. in width ran from east to west. A number of superimposed layers of plaster were found in the street. Beyond it, further to the north, a new building complex was partially excavated. Only a very small segment of it has been unearthed, including one room paved with large flat stones. By the end of the 2003 season, the excavation goals in Areas E and G had been achieved and no more work was carried out in these localities. In order to protect the ancient remains from damage caused by natural forces and human activities, as well as to prevent any possible injury to people visiting the site, Areas E and G were completely backfilled. In Area E, a layer of black sand from the nearby Poria Quarry, ca. 0.20 m. thick, was spread directly above the Neolithic remains to provide unmistakable evidence of our work here for future archaeologists. This was covered by a layer of local sediments from nearby fishpond embankments. In Area G, black geo- textile sheets were placed over stone walls to protect them, and then local sediments were spread over them. Fig. 1 .17. A small pottery jar decorated with incised herringbone pattern from Area H. 15</page><page sequence="40">CHAPTER 1 Fig. 1 .18. A zoomorphic clay figurine from Area N. THE ELEVENTH EXCAVATION SEASON (2004) The work in this season focused on a single new excavation area, Area N. This letter was chosen because the new area was located on a small local tell whose Arabic name is Tell Abu Nimmel. This is a small low hill covering an area of approximately 5000 sq. m. in the fields of Kibbutz Massada. An area of 200 sq. m. was excavated from topsoil to virgin soil. We discerned three main occupations, from top to bottom: modern activities, a late Islamic cemetery, and two phases of the Pottery Neolithic period. The upper Neolithic phase was largely destroyed by modern activities and the cemetery. The lower phase, resting on virgin soil, was also damaged and its architecture was fragmentary. On the eastern edge of Area N, part of a building was revealed, while the central and western parts of Area N functioned as an open area with various installations. The debris here was very rich in finds, including numerous flint items, stone utensils of limestone and basalt, pottery, animal bones and chunks of charcoal. The large flint assemblage included many axes, which were quite rare in Areas E and H. The pottery showed the typical Yarmukian forms and the classic incised herringbone patterns. Exotic items made of obsidian and seashells were also found, as well as a few figurines. The anthropomorphic figurines include an incised limestone pebble and fragments of clay items. An outstanding zoomorphic representation found this season was a clay bovid head with emphasized horns (Fig. 1.18). RADIOMETRIC DATINGS FROM SHA4 AR HAGOLAN The dates quoted here are uncalibrated BP. Calibrated dates are given in years BCE. In recent years, calibration programs have changed our conceptions of the chronology of pre- and protohistoric periods. The basic chronological sequence of the Neolithic period in the Southern Levant was formulated by Kenyon following her extensive excavations at Jericho in the 1950s (Kenyon 1957, 1960, 1981). She discerned two pre- pottery phases, which she designated Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB). These were succeeded by a settlement gap of several centuries, followed by two consecutive pottery phases, Pottery Neolithic A (PNA) and Pottery Neolithic B (PNB). The earlier part of this sequence, Pre-Pottery Neolithic, was accepted by scholars during the 1960s through the 1980s without any serious objections (Perrot 1968; Bar-Yosef 1981; Stager 1992). Jericho produced a number of radiometric dates for the two earlier Neolithic phases. There are some 20 dates for the PPNA, most of them falling between 10,300 and 9200 BP, and some 20 dates for the PPNB, most falling between 9200 and 8200 BP (Burleigh 1981; 1983), all of these dates uncalibrated. The two later Neolithic settlements at Jericho, however, produced no radiometric dates at all. This resulted in much speculation as to the relative, as well as absolute, chronology of the later sequence of the Neolithic period in the Southern Levant (see discussions in Garfinkel 1999a, 1999b). The site of Sha'ar Hagolan and the Yarmukian culture have traditionally been dated to various stages of the 6th or 5th millennia BCE (see Garfinkel 1999b: 1-9 for discussion and references), although this dating was not founded on well- established radiocarbon dates from scientifically excavated contexts. In order to solve the chronological uncertainty, we submitted a large number of organic samples for radiometric dating. Unfortunately, the preservation of organic material at Sha'ar Hagolan was very poor and only tiny fragments of charcoal were retrieved. Thus, it was not possible to conduct botanical identification of the wood. Twenty-three samples of small charcoal chunks were submitted to the Oxford accelerator unit. The laboratory was unable to process seven of the samples, and the remaining 27 produced the results presented in Table 1.3 and Fig. 1.19. There are nine PPNC dates and 18 PNA dates. The first problem one faces when dealing with the 8th millennium BP is the transition from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B to the Pottery Neolithic. The PPNB is one of the best- documented Neolithic phases in the Levant, known from dozens of sites and radiometrically well dated (Kuijt and Bar- Yosef 1994). It apparently came to an end by 8000 BP and did not continue into the 8th millennium BP. The first PN units, on the other hand, seem to have existed in the second half of the 8th millennium BP (see below). One is thus confronted with the question of what occurred during some 600 years between the end of the PPNB and the beginning of the PNA. Four suggestions to bridge the gap have been advanced: 1 Kenyon (1960) suggested a settlement gap of several centuries between the PPNB and PNA. 2 Perrot (1969) proposed a settlement gap of one thousand years at the end of the PPNB, which he named Hiatus Palestinien. 3 Stager, in the new edition of Chronologies in Old World Archaeology (1992), suggests that the PNA followed immediately after the PPNB, with no gap at all. 16</page><page sequence="41">INTRODUCTION Table 1 .3.

In some publications, the synonymous term "Final PPNB" has been used (Rollefson 1989: 69). This unit lies above the PPNB and below the Yarmukian of the PNA at 'Ain Ghazal. Of these four proposals, it is quite clear today that an additional pre-pottery Neolithic stage, the PPNC, existed between the end of the PPNB and the beginning of the PN (Nissen 1993; Perrot 1993b). Thus, the supposed gap in the settlement of the Southern Levant was, in fact, a gap in our knowledge. PPNC sites have recently been reported on both sides of the Jordan, on the east at 4 Ain Ghazal (Rollefson 1989) and Wadi Shu'eib (Simmons et al. 2001) and on the west at Ashkelon, Layer 2 at Tel 4 Ali (Garfinkel 1993a, 1994), 4 Atlit Yam (Galili et al. 1993), Layer VI at Hagoshrim (Getzov 1999), and now at Sha4ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 2003b). Table 1.4 and Fig. 1.20 present radiometric dates for the PPNC at the sites of Sha'ar Hagolan, Ashkelon and Tel 4 Ali, in chronological order. These range between ca. 8000 and ca. 7500 BP. Calibration of the data produces dates of ca. 7000- 6400 BCE. The specific context of the Sha'ar Hagolan PPNC dates, however, is not so simple. From the approximately 1 m. of PPNC accumulation in Area E, three samples (SH 16, SH 22 and SH 23) were submitted for dating. Unfortunately, all three samples failed. Thus, we have no samples from the main PPNC deposits at the site. The other samples from PPNC deposits originated in Area G, where the only clearly defined PPNC remains are from Pit G 103/ 191. The two samples (SH 13 and SH 14) were taken from Pit G 103, which is the upper sediment of the pit. The other three samples (SH 15, SH 20 and SH 21) came from the lower parts of two deep pits, G 167 and G 174. These are Pottery Neolithic pits that apparently penetrated into earlier PPNC sediments. Table 1 .5 and Fig. 1 .21 present the Yarmukian radiometric dates published to date in chronological order, from Sha4ar Hagolan and other Yarmukian sites. The dates clearly indicate 17</page><page sequence="42">CHAPTER 1 Fig. 1.19. Radiometric dates from Sha'ar Hagolan. that the Yarmukian culture flourished between ca. 7500 and 7000 BP. Calibration of the data gives dates of ca. 6400-5800 BCE. Sha'ar Hagolan should be placed in the earlier part of the period. Internally, the site seems to have developed in three stages. The earliest, which predates the massive architecture, is known from Area G, especially the radiometric dates from the well, and dates as early as 7500 BP. About 50-100 years later, the large courtyard building complexes, dating ca. 7450/7400 BP, were constructed. The later phase of the buildings is dated by a number of radiometric samples to ca. 7250 BP. The emmer seed, which is a short-lived organic material, produced a date of ca. 7285 BP. Thus, it seems that the two phases of these buildings in Areas E and G lasted for about 150 years. Since no younger dates were obtained, the period between 7250 and 7000 was probably not represented in Areas E and G. Additional dates from the upper sequence of Area G, the lower sequence of Area E, and Areas H and N would help us to reach a better understanding of the chronology of the various stages within the site of Sha'ar Hagolan. However, this is an expensive procedure, and it is uncertain if the necessary funds will be available. Table 1.4.

The short definitions of technical and conceptual terms presented here will aid the reader in using the stratigraphie and architectural descriptions in Parts II and III of this volume. Color photographs relating to the excavation's logistics and methodology appear in the popular book on Sha'ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 2004a). LOGISTICS AND METHODOLOGY IN THE FIELD ORGANIZATION OF EXPEDITION The staff of the expedition included archaeology students who supervised the digging, assigned the excavation units and bucket numbers, and documented the activities of the day with written records, drawings and photographs. An essential part of the job was to instruct the volunteers, who usually lacked experience , on digging and sieving techniques . Most of the staff members joined in the expedition over a number of seasons. In addition, scholars from various disciplines, such as zoology and botany, participated in the research of the site. The hundreds of volunteers who have passed through Sha'ar Hagolan over the years, from the USA, the UK, Germany, Israel, Canada, the Netherlands, Poland, Denmark, Italy, Hungary, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Brazil, Ireland and Switzerland, needed no previous archaeological experience, only high motivation. They paid for their travel to Israel and their accommodation at the guesthouse of Kibbutz Sha'ar Hagolan, " el Mul Golan". Two to four volunteers roomed together in air-conditioned accommodations, and food was supplied by the kibbutz dining room, which caters for the entire local community of ca. 500 people. The first three seasons (1989-90, 1996) were conducted on a small scale, lasting for three weeks each with about ten participants at any given time. During 1997-99, each excavation season lasted for six weeks between June, July and August with about 50 participants (the 1999 season was especially popular, with some 80 people working simultaneously). The seasons of 2001-2003 were affected by political events in the region (the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the war in Iraq). Our team in those years consisted of only 15-25 people, and the number of overseas volunteers dropped drastically. However, in these seasons we were joined by quite a few volunteers from Israel, including youth groups from the Youth Science Center of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Some volunteers return year after year; our senior volunteer, Kurt from Phoenix, Arizona, celebrated his 80th birthday in the summer of 2003. ORGANIZATION OF FIELD WORK The harsh summer climate of the Jordan Valley, with temperatures that sometimes reach 40°C, demanded special measures, such as net awnings to provide shade (Color Plate Ilia) and a strict regime to ensure that everyone drank sufficient water: cold water was brought specially from the kibbutz and was always available in the excavation areas. The expedition's camp manager arranged the transport of the food, the setting of the tables and the water supply. Work in the field ceased at 1 p.m.; the equipment was returned to the container and the awnings were dismantled to prevent them from blowing away in the strong winds that prevail in the region in the afternoons. The camp manager supervised the transport of the finds and the team back to the kibbutz. At 4:30 p.m., everybody met to wash and sort the morning's finds. Twice a week there were lectures on archaeology after dinner, and once a week in the afternoon, there was a tour to archaeological or historical sites in the region. Excavation took place five days a week, Monday to Friday. Saturday and Sunday were devoted to rest and trips to various parts of Israel. Every Friday we concluded the week with a tour of the entire site, in which each area supervisor explained how work had progressed during the week. CONTROLLING THE EXCAVATION The excavation at Sha'ar Hagolan combined prehistoric and biblical excavation methodologies (see also SHI). A 10 x 10 m. excavation grid was laid out on the site, and each square given an uppercase letter (north-south gridlines) and an Arabic number (east-west gridlines). The 10 x 10 m. squares were subdivided into four 5 x 5 m. squares denoted by lowercase letters (Fig. 2.1). In Areas E and H, our strategy was to expose large areas of a single phase in an attempt to understand the architecture and village planning, and consequently the lower strata were scarcely reached in these areas. In contrast, in Area G a deep trench was excavated to expose the complete stratigraphie sequence. In Area N, the local topography and the limited space did not correspond well with the site grid, and therefore a local ad hoc grid of eight 5 x 5 m. squares was employed only for this location. Control of the excavation in the field was conducted at a number of levels: 21</page><page sequence="45">CHAPTER 2 Fig. 2.1. The grid at Sha'ar Hagolan: the subdivision of an excavation square. Bucket "Bucket" is both a purely technical term and a basic logistic requirement of the excavation process. Ten-liter plastic buckets served two purposes: first, black buckets were filled with the excavated sediment and transferred to the sieving posts. By counting the number of buckets removed from each excavation unit we could calculate the volume of the unit and thus the density of certain finds categories. Secondly, colored buckets- to differentiate from black buckets-were used as containers for the various finds uncovered during the excavations. Basket The technical excavation unit was the basket. All the sediment removed from a specific locus (see below), or part of a locus on a specific day, received a distinct basket number. In each locus a new basket number was given every day, or even two or three basket numbers if the area was particularly rich in finds or if we wanted more accurate, specific control (e.g., distinguishing between the left and right halves of a room). Baskets were numbered sequentially, with the area denoted by an uppercase letter; for example, Basket E100 comes from Area E. Locus Excavation was carried out within each square in accordance with the sediments encountered. The first unit was always topsoil. As the Neolithic layer was reached, archaeological features began to appear. Every feature observed, whether man-made (wall, floor, pit, debris, etc.), depositional (fill, destruction layer, etc.) or natural accumulation (topsoil, winter erosion, flood wash, etc.), received a distinct locus number. The "skeleton" of the site is made up of loci associated with architectural elements, and between them are the depositional layers. During excavations, loci were sometimes opened for technical reasons, if a new feature or phenomenon was anticipated. The loci were numbered sequentially in each excavation area, starting in the first season of excavation, prefixed by an uppercase letter denoting the area, for example, Locus E100 comes from Area E. Stratum All the loci associated with a specific chronological phase comprise a stratum. At the end of each season, and especially at the end of the project, all the loci in each area were analyzed to verify their spatial and vertical (stratigraphie) relationships. A stratum can have a number of phases, which are small- scale local changes appearing in a wall or a room, while the basic configuration of the architecture remains the same. If a stratum lasted two generations, ca. 50 years, then the sub- phases represent renovations that took place within this 50- year period. RECORDING Recording in the field was conducted at two levels: the basket and the locus (see also SHI). A special form, the "basket form", was filled out for each basket (Fig. 2.2); it includes a 1:50 schematic drawing of the square showing the location of the basket in relation to other features. A "locus form" was filled out for each locus (Fig. 2.3), which includes technical data on the locus (square, type, dates, upper/lower elevations), the numbers of the baskets associated with it, basic stratigraphie relationships with other loci, a detailed description and a 1:50 schematic drawing of the locus. During the course of analysis, redundant loci were identified and combined into one. Redundant loci are recorded in the loci list and the block diagrams. During the sorting of the finds in the afternoons, another form was filled out, a "count form" (Fig. 2.4), which records the quantity of the various categories of finds (pottery, bones, stone vessels, figurines, etc.) in each basket. Flint was not counted due to the large quantities. Pottery sherds were counted according to periods, and all diagnostic sherds were marked. All three forms were entered into the computer database to facilitate later analyses. Ideally, this was done daily during the course of excavation, although in reality, some of this data entry extended past the end of the season. Another form filled out at the end of the season was a "closing form" for each square. This form describes the various features in the square (location, elevation) and the general stratigraphy in the form of a block diagram (Fig. 2.5). This is the basic format in which information was transferred from one season to the next. EARTH-REMOVING METHODS A number of methods were employed for the removal of the soil and the exposure of the ancient remains, depending on the nature of the task. The working method, the tools and the number of participants were dictated by the scale of the work. To demolish the embankments of the old fishponds we used heavy mechanical equipment, which can move hundreds of tons of earth in a single day.

A count form. when we opened a new excavation area, a backhoe was used to delicately scrape away the 0.20-0.30 m. of topsoil that covered the ancient remains. This topsoil layer was characterized by its dark brown color and meager finds (Fig. 2.6). The Neolithic layer, in contrast, was usually easy to identify by its light gray color and abundance of finds. These differences enabled us to operate the backhoe without damaging the archaeological remains. The backhoe was also used to remove the mounds of sieved soil that piled up at the sieving stations. When we approached an archaeological level, we worked by hand, breaking up the soil with pickaxes and collecting it with hoes. When the Neolithic layer was reached over the entire square, the work became much slower. While fills could be excavated by large picks and hoes, debris layers and floor levels were removed by small picks and trowels. Brushes of various sizes were also used, and dental tools were utilized for special features such as burials or complete items. At Sha'ar Hagolan, every stone was examined with great care, lest we throw away a pebble figurine. All the sediment from the Neolithic levels was collected in buckets and dry sieved. At this pace we averaged a depth of 0.05-0.10 m. per day per square. SIEVING AND FLOTATION Extracting the soil from an archaeological level was merely the first step in the fieldwork. All the soil collected in the buckets was subsequently passed through a sieve with a mesh of 2 x 2 mm. The sieves were fixed in a metal framework close to the excavation area and covered by net awnings (Color Plate Illb). Due to the intensive pace of work, we were obliged to use stainless steel mesh, which, although expensive, proved to be robust over the years and justified its high cost. Once the soil passed through the mesh, all the finds, including flint tools, potsherds and animal bones, were carefully collected. Each volunteer devoted three or four hours a day to sieving the soil that he or she had excavated. Sieving was a most important part of the excavation process at Sha'ar Hagolan. In some seasons, flotation was practiced in addition to the regular sieving. A special flotation installation was built with the help of S. Allen and J. Hansen of Boston University, comprising a barrel, two settling basins, a pump that circulated the water in a closed system, and a sieve to catch the finds. In the first stage, the soil was dumped into the barrel and the larger, heavier items, such as bones, potsherds and flint, sank to the bottom and were collected in a net. At this point, we were able to recover a sample of small finds that were invisible during regular sieving, such as tiny flakes of flint and small bones of birds, fish and rodents. At the same time, the water flowing in the barrel collected charred remains of seeds and wood, brought them to the surface, and then overflowed into an extremely fine mesh. The water continued to flow through the settling basins, where the mud was deposited, and then was pumped back into the barrel for further use. The recycling of the water represented a considerable economy in the operation of the installation. TREATMENT OF THE FINDS In the field, all the finds from an excavated unit, such as flint, pottery and bones, were collected into plastic buckets. Special artifacts, such as samples of charcoal, figurines, delicate bones, etc., were separated. All these items were brought to the kibbutz and in the afternoon were washed and then laid out on trays in the shade to dry. The staff members sorted the washed and dried items from the previous day into categories, 25 SHÁ'AR HAGOLAN 2003 COUNT FORM AREA BASKET square Locus Date Flint Pottery Pottery Bone Shell Stone Weight Figurine Other Other __ ; Period ~ __ # r&gt;i, Mi iT v % *} ± ± - ~ H .CIS rroc^i'i A '' z ~ Í JZL H /&lt;:T MwaMi 'Ví i/ 6 &lt;r~ * í: s. d ?? ¿H™ 3i3. m v/ n _rļ g3q Cc ft Í 'S HIHI f-f e&gt;3&lt;) AW liã r 1 1 tf (CH7K ZC'? it jí V A U SU( C^i&lt;sc Sbí igļb V 4 &lt;)% »i. ¥ y »■ rs.

The dark alluvial topsoil on top 01 the whitish Neolithic layer. e.g., potsherds, flint, stone vessels and utensils, shells and bones, each of which was packed separately. The finds were later transferred to the scholars who were studying them. PHOTOGRAPHY Photography is an important means of documentation, and thus each wall, installation and floor was photographed to provide a record of its appearance immediately after being uncovered. Since we often dismantled features to continue excavating below them, or they were damaged over the years by the ravages of the weather, the photographs provide an invaluable record. The angles and viewpoints of the photographs were chosen in accordance with the size of the features. Single rooms and parts of buildings were shot from a ladder 2.5 m. high, while larger areas, or photographs summarizing a whole season's work, demanded the assistance of a cherry-picker that could reach a height of 12 m. In the 2001 season, we used a firemen's ladder that was 43 m. high. HORIZONTALAND VERTICAL EXPOSURES Our main priority was to expose large tracts of the Neolithic settlement to better understand its architecture and spatial organization. To this end, Areas E and H were developed into large horizontal exposures of 1800 and 750 sq. m. respectively. Originally, the aim was to excavate two complete buildings in three different parts of the site (six buildings in all). However, as each building actually comprised a large complex, we managed to unearth only three. In order to achieve the plan of a complete building, we did not fix the final size or shape of the area in advance, and each season, sometimes even during the season, new excavation squares were opened to follow walls, rooms or streets. Thus, the excavation process was dictated by what was unearthed. In most cases, our efforts focused on the uppermost phase of each building, and we did not penetrate into the lower phases of construction. In our view, it is better to expose the uppermost (and contemporary) phase of three different structures than to excavate three successive phases of a single building. To attain data on the vertical dimension of the site, the 20 x 5 ni. stratigraphie trench in Area G was begun in 1999, taking three excavation seasons to reach from topsoil to virgin soil. Some 3 m. of occupation were revealed, included eight phases of Yarmukian activity and below them the meager remains of a Pre-Pottery Neolithic C occupation. In addition, in the 2003 excavation season four test pits were excavated in the lower part of Area E, down to virgin soil. At this location, a meter of debris dating from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C was found. CLOSING THE SITE When excavations in an area were concluded, the area was backfilled to the level of the surrounding topsoil-an expensive and labor-intensive operation. The cost of sand for the entire excavation area (nearly 800 tons) and the rental of the mechanical device (four working days) was $5000. Backfilling was conducted according to the following procedures: Area F: This area was backfilled in 1998 with local sediment. Area G: This area was backfilled in 2003 . Black geo-textile sheets were first laid over the stones of the cross-section of the well, and on the archaeological remains in Square P47b, and then covered by local sediment. Area E: This area was backfilled in 2003 with 0.20 m. of black sand acquired from the nearby Poria Quarry, brought in large trucks, each carrying about 40 tons (Fig. 2.7), and then spread over the archaeological remains by hand (Fig. 2.8). On top of the sand, local sediment was spread by a heavy mechanical device. Area H: This area was backfilled in 2004 with 0.20 m. of black sand spread by hand over the archaeological layer, and then covered by local sediment, as in Area E. Area N: This area was backfilled in 2004, as in Areas E and H, first with black sand and then with local sediment. ARCHITECTURAL AND STRATIGRAPHIC DEFINITIONS In general, two types of loci can be defined at Sha'ar Hagolan. The first is a locus denoting architectural elements such as walls, installations, floors, pavements and pits, which also appear on the excavation plans. The second type is a locus denoting units of sediment such as debris and fills. While the latter contain most of the finds unearthed in the excavations, loci of the first category also produce varying quantities of sediments and finds., ARCHITECTURAL DEFINITIONS Wall An architectural feature comprising the contour of a stone and/ or brick wall. The locus also denotes the material recovered from the dismantling of the wall when relevant. Floor This term usually defines the level of a beaten-earth floor, though occasionally a mud-plaster, lime-plaster or stone-paved surface could be distinguished. Generally, floor loci include the material lying upon the floor, while the layer constituting the foundation of the floor, if observed, is defined as the floor make-up. In some cases it is difficult to distinguish the floor 27</page><page sequence="51">CHAPTER 2 Fig. 2.7. Delivery of the sand to Area E. Fig. 2.8. Covering Area E with sand. 28</page><page sequence="52">LOGISTICS AND METHODOLOGY itself and the floor level is therefore defined either according to the density and nature of finds (complete vessels, large, horizontally lying sherds, etc.), or according to installations related to floors. In such cases, the upper and lower elevations reflect the layer of accumulation related to the floor. In other cases, floors were defined according to the base levels of walls associated with them, or were combined with the debris layers above them. Pavement These are stone pavements of various types. This type of locus is an architectural, two-dimensional unit, representing the surface of the pavement, rather than a unit of sediment excavation. The elevations given for the pavement reflect the highest and lowest points on its surface. The locus may include the material from the dismantling of the pavement, when relevant. Installation Installations include hearths, mortars, grinding stones and features of uncertain function made of stones and/or bricks. The locus denotes the feature itself and the material recovered from it, if and when dismantled. The term "stones" denotes a line or concentration of stones not necessarily relating to an identified architectural feature or wall. Pit A pit is a feature dug from an upper layer and penetrating into lower ones. Pits were usually dug from floor levels, although the floors are not necessarily preserved or identified. The locus denotes both the contour of the pit and the sediment excavated within it. A burial pit may be denoted a burial. Miscellaneous feature Other types of architectural elements, for example thresholds and postholes, are defined according to their character and location within the buildings. Debris This is the most common excavation unit, denoting a volume of sediment excavated in a defined architectural context and representing occupational debris on the floors of rooms or open areas. The upper level of the debris is usually below the highest preserved level of the walls around it and its lower level is a floor or paving, or the base of the surrounding walls if the debris above the floor could not be distinguished from the floor level itself. In some cases, the debris is mixed with fallen mudbrick material. The term "debris" may also be used as a default term even when the architectural context is less than clear. Fill This locus type denotes either a constructional or other fill below floor levels, or sediments above the highest preserved level of the walls and other architectural units. It includes, in most cases, the brick material from the walls. Another term used is sediment, a natural phenomenon rather than an intentional fill, which usually denotes the sediment within an installation such as a hearth or pithos. Topsoil The uppermost layer of sediment at the site, above all architectural features and fills. This soil was used in modern farming activities at the site. STRATIGRAPHIC DEFINITIONS Each stratum is comprised of several depositional layers that include fills lying above debris and walls lying above floor levels, which in turn lie above fills, etc. In some cases, the uppermost fills in a stratigraphie sequence are assigned an independent stratum. An architectural unit such as a room or a building may have several strata or phases. Usually, if one wall lies above another, two different strata are defined, while if several different floor levels relate to the same wall, or when alterations to a wall are observed, different phases are defined within the same stratum. Stratigraphie relationships between features include: elements (mostly walls) adjoining each other, demonstrating that they are completely contemporaneous; aligned elements, when the reconstructed continuance of two walls can be connected to make a corner; floors or paving reaching walls or installations, indicating complete contemporaneity; an element cutting or covering/sealing another, when the cutting/covering feature is clearly later; and an element lying above/below another, which presents an unclear temporal relationship. "Adjacent elements" is a merely spatial term. PRESENTATION OF EXCAVATION RESULTS SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS Although it usually takes decades to publish a final excavation report, in view of the special importance of the data unearthed at Neolithic Sha'ar Hagolan we have invested great efforts in publishing the results promptly. Publication has been carried out on two levels: to the scientific community on the one hand and to the general public on the other hand. Presentation to the archaeological community has appeared in three stages: 1 Preliminary reports in the form of "Notes and News", usually presented at the end of each season, or several seasons together (e.g., Garfinkel 1997, 2002c, 2003b, 2005; Garfinkel and Miller 1999), as well as lectures at various local and international meetings. 2 Articles published in professional journals presenting various aspects of the renewed excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan (e.g., Garfinkel 1993, 1999b, 2003a). 3 Monographs. In 2002 we published the first volume in the Sha'ar Hagolan monograph series, Sha'ar Hagolan 1: Neolithic Art in Context (Garfinkel and Miller 2002a). This 262-page monograph presents an interim summary of various aspects of the site: history of research, fieldwork, architecture, pottery, flint tools, stone tools, art objects, botanical and faunai remains. The current volume is the second in the series, of which five more are planned, each concentrating on a different subject: pottery and baked clay objects, flint and obsidian artifacts, basalt and limestone items, art objects, and other miscellaneous topics. This strategy was necessary due, firstly, to the large volume of data. Secondly, the coordination of so many scholars for 29</page><page sequence="53">CHAPTER 2 a simultaneous publication is an almost impossible task often resulting in reports being published decades after the fieldwork was completed. In this way, by dividing the publication into a number of smaller teams, the report will go to print without delay when one team has finished its work. POPULAR PRESENTATIONS The rich assemblage of art objects from Neolithic Sha'ar Hagolan has great appeal for the general public, and has been presented in three ways: 1 Short notes with attractive photographs in popular periodicals, such as the National Geographic Magazine (November 2002, Geographica section) and the Biblical Archaeology Review (1999, Vol. 25/3: 64). 2 Articles in popular journals, such as Archeology Odyssey (Garfinkel and Miller 2000), Qadmoniot (Garfinkel 1996) and Minerva (Garfinkel 2001b). 3 Popular books. First published in Hebrew under the title Sha'ar Hagolan: Neolithic Art in the Jordan Valley (Garfinkel 2002a) and a year later in English as The Goddess of Sha'ar Hagolan : Excavations at a Neolithic Site in Israel , a 216-page popular book presents to the general public the results of our project up to 2003. The book covers all aspects of the expedition and is accompanied by over 350 color photographs, many of them full page (Garfinkel 2004a). Another popular publication is a museum catalogue published by the Bible Lands Museum, Jerusalem, in 1999, entitled The Yarmukians , Neolithic Art from Sha'ar Hagolan. This 96-page exhibition catalogue accompanied an exhibit of finds from the site specially organized by the museum (see below). MUSEUM EXHIBITS Sha'ar Hagolan Museum: In 1950, members of Kibbutz Sha'ar Hagolan, organized by Mr. Yehudah Roth, founded the Sha'ar Hagolan Museum in one of the bomb shelters of the kibbutz. This was the first prehistoric museum in Israel, described by the well-known anthropologist Robert Ardrey (1967). In the 1970s, the museum was rehoused in a spacious building overlooking the ancient site with a view of the Mountains of Gilead. The museum, intended for schoolchildren and members of the general public, presents a comprehensive view, with the aid of drawings and explanatory texts, of the artifacts of Yarmukian culture: pottery, stone utensils, flint tools and dozens of art objects. Ha'aretz Museum, Tel Aviv: A few artifacts collected on the surface of the site, including pottery sherds and a pebble figurine, are on permanent exhibit. The Bible Lands Museum, Jerusalem: Nearly 200 artifacts from the site were exhibited to the general public for four months in the spring and summer of 1999. An elaborate catalogue accompanied the exhibit (Garfinkel 1999c). The Israel Museum, Jerusalem; A number of items are on permanent exhibit, including the largest clay figurine and the largest pebble figurine uncovered so far at the site. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York: Twenty objects are on a ten-year exhibit in the renovated Near Eastern galleries, which were opened to the public in 1999. The Louvre Museum, Paris: Ten objects are on exhibit in a special showcase in the room devoted to the southern Levant. 30</page><page sequence="54">CHAPTER 3 YARMUKIAN BUILDING TECHNIQUES The extensive remains of Yarmukian architecture at Sha'ar Hagolan have no parallels at other Pottery Neolithic sites in the southern Levant. The field observations, therefore, open new horizons for the study of many aspects of building techniques in that period. The presentation of this material is divided into three sections. The first section deals with the building materials in use in the Pottery Neolithic period, while the second deals with the architectural components, such as walls, floors and various installations, and further clarifies the terms used in the architectural descriptions of Parts II and III of this report. The third section of this chapter presents some observations on traditional mudbrick architecture in the Palestinian village of 'Uja in the southern Jordan Valley. These ethnographic data aid us in visualizing the Neolithic village of Sha'ar Hagolan. BUILDING MATERIALS The building materials used at Sha'ar Hagolan comprise three main categories: stone, clay and organic materials (wood or reeds). While stone and clay were well preserved, the organic materials have decomposed and disappeared from the archaeological record, and we can only infer their use based on indirect evidence. STONES Stones are not found naturally on the surface of the Jordan Valley, as the local geological bed is the Lisan Formation, comprising clay sediment deposited at the bottom of a Pleistocene lake. However, the rivers that descend from the surrounding mountains carry stones into the valley in the form of river pebbles, and such pebbles were available to the ancient inhabitants of Sha'ar Hagolan from the nearby Yarmuk River. This river collects basalt pebbles from the volcanic sediments of the Golan Heights in its northern section, and limestone and flint pebbles in the Gilead Mountains to the south. However, at Sha'ar Hagolan there was a clear preference for basalt pebbles, which constituted over 95% of the stones used at the site. According to their size and shape, the stone component can be divided into five groups: Large flat pebbles Exceptionally large, flat basalt pebbles were used for paving the entrance from the street into Building Complex I in Area E (Fig. 3.1). No similar concentration of basalt slabs was found in any other part of the site. In other locations, large to medium-sized flat pebbles were used, as in the threshold to Room E (Fig. 3.2) and the pavement in Room G of Building Complex I. Large and medium-sized rounded pebbles These comprise the basic component of the construction of walls (Fig. 3.3). No selection was made for shape, and most of the stones are thick and rounded. Over 95% of the pebbles are of basalt, although limestone and even flint pebbles were used as well. Medium and small flat pebbles These pebbles were used for the paving of storerooms, installations and interior thresholds that led from courtyards to rooms (Fig. 3.4). Small rounded and angular stones Such pebbles were used for hearths, the paving of installations, and in Room G of Building Complex II in Area E. In many courtyards the original floor was covered with such stones, probably to avoid mud in winter (Figs. 3.5-3.6). Rounded gravel stones The road between Building Complexes I and II in Area E was surfaced with small rounded gravel stones mixed with mud plaster (Fig. 3.7). These stones were probably collected from the nearby riverbed, as they include many very small (less than 1 cm.) flint river pebbles. CLAY Two basic sources of clay were exploited at Sha'ar Hagolan, whitish clay of the local Lisan Formation and dark alluvial clay brought by the river. The Lisan clay could have been collected from exposed sections or from pits dug into the site, while the dark alluvial clay was collected along the banks of the Yarmuk River. As the Neolithic level in general is whitish in color, it is clear that most of the clay used by the ancient inhabitants was Lisan clay. Clay was used for various purposes: Mudbricks Mudbricks are the most ubiquitous raw material at Sha'ar Hagolan, used extensively in all the excavated areas, especially in Areas E and H. The brick material has a light gray to whitish color typical of the marl of the Lisan Formation and contains organic inclusions and sometimes small, sharp pieces of flint. The bricks are plano-convex in shape ("bun"- or "loaf"- shaped), about 12 cm in diameter (Figs. 3.8-3.12). Similarly 31</page><page sequence="55">CHAPTER 3 Fig. 3.1 .

The upper curved surface of the brick was smoothed and is harder than the inner part of the brick (Color Plate Villa). Mud plaster In some cases, a thin layer of mud was spread between the brick courses, acting as a binding agent and filling the spaces created by the rounded upper surfaces of the bricks. Mud plaster was probably also smeared on the outer sides of the walls to protect them from deterioration. Mud paving Mud plaster was occasionally used to surface large areas. For 32</page><page sequence="56">YARMUKIAN BUILDING TECHNIQUES example, thick layers of whitish mud plaster paved the surface of the street in Area H (Figs. 3.13-3.14), a thick layer of mud plaster constituted the floor of Room C in Building Complex I of Area H (Fig. 3.15), and a large plastered area was also found in Area N. The plaster layer was sometimes very thin, as in Floor G22 in Area G (Fig. 3.16). Installations In places, mud plaster was discerned in small confined areas, Fig. 3.4. Area E, Pavement E69 made of flat, medium-sized river pebbles in Room I of Building Complex I. often near a wall, probably comprising small installations (see below, Fig. 3.35).

Roofs Fragments and lumps of mud with imprints of straw on one side were recovered from Area N (Fig. 3.17), most probably originating from the roofing of a building. Pottery As baking clay creates pottery, the use of pottery in construction also falls within this category. In one case, in the courtyard of Building Complex I in Area H, a rounded surface was paved with stones together with pottery sherds (Fig. 3.18), clear evidence of the recycling of broken pottery into architectural use. In two cases, one in Area E and the 35</page><page sequence="59">CHAPTER 3 Fig. 3.17. Area N, lump of mud with straw imprints, probably from roofing. other in Area H, complete pithoi were sunken below floor level (Fig. 3.19). PERISHABLE MATERIALS The use of perishable materials such as wood, reeds, straw and leather can be deduced from the indirect evidence of postholes, imprints on clay and pottery, and ethnographic observations of traditional buildings in the region. Wood Few postholes were discerned at Sha'ar Hagolan. As roofed rooms were quite narrow, it would seem that the use of wooden posts to support the roof was not very common. Reeds and straw Direct evidence for the use of such materials is very rare in the region but is known, for example, from PPNA and PPNB floors at Jericho (Kenyon 1981: Pis. 42a-b, 49a-b, 147a, 158a, 159b, 161a). At Sha'ar Hagolan, only the imprints of straw or reeds were visible on the bases of pottery vessels, on one clay sealing, and on lumps of clay used for roofing in Area N (see above). From the ethnographic observations below, we learn that reeds and straw were probably used mainly for roof construction. ARCHITECTURAL COMPONENTS AND INSTALLATIONS As mentioned above, buildings and installations were constructed with stones, clay and wood/reeds. The selection of Fig. 3.18.

WALLS Walls of various types were encountered in the Yarmukian settlement, all built with stones and mudbricks. The most 36</page><page sequence="60">YARMUKIAN BUILDING TECHNIQUES Fig. 3.20. The massive stone podium of Wall El 5, which served as a base for the mudbrick superstructure. common stones are rounded basalt river pebbles, while limestone or flint pebbles occur only rarely. The mudbrick superstructure of the walls was built of courses of "bun-shaped" bricks, each course consisting of several rows of densely arranged bricks. In some cases, a thin layer of mud served as a binding material between the courses, while in others the courses of bricks touch each other without a separating layer. In the latter cases, it is probable that the bricks were laid while they were still wet. Large stone podium The base of this type of wall is a wide stone foundation, 0.60- 1 .00 m., reaching a height of up to 0.50 m. (five to six courses of stones). The stone construction is flat-topped, creating a podium for the mudbrick superstructure (Fig. 3.20). The bricks probably added 1 .3-1 .5 m in height, the entire wall reaching a total of nearly 2 m. This type of wall was usually an outer enclosure wall or the wall of an especially large room. "Frame- and-fill" construction The base of this type of wall is an outer frame of large , elongated rounded river pebbles with a fill comprised of smaller, angular and rounded pebbles and mud (Fig. 3.21). Mudbricks were sometimes placed between the stones (Figs. 3.22-3.23). Simple base The foundation of this type of wall is a single course of rounded river pebbles. Thicker walls may have two or three parallel rows (Fig. 3.24). This type of construction was usually used for inner partition walls. Buttresses Some of the walls had been strengthened by stone buttresses, either rectangular and attached parallel to the wall, or constructed as short walls adjoining the corner of two walls from the outside (Fig. 3.25). "Standing stones" Some walls, usually the circumference walls of installations, were constructed from flat, elongated pebbles standing on their narrow end (Fig. 3.26). The stones were probably buried in the ground to some depth, since otherwise they would not have been stable. Indeed, we usually found these stones fallen from their original position; only one or two were still standing (see below, Figs. 3.31-3.32). Lines of stones Sometimes a narrow row of small stones or a circle of stones was found (Fig. 3.27), usually in open areas. Constructions of this type could not bear the weight of a second course and were thus used for shallow installations or to define an activity area. They may possibly be interpreted as stone foundations of installations made of perishable materials such as straw or leather. 37</page><page sequence="61">CHAPTER 3 Fig .3.21.

The floors unearthed at Sha'ar Hagolan can be divided more specifically into the following types: Pavements of flat stones Pavements of flat stones were located in both rooms and open areas. These pavements were constructed of a single layer of Fig. 3.27. Area E, the rounded Installation E315 in the courtyard of Building Complex IV. densely arranged, large or medium-sized, flat rounded pebbles, mostly basalt (Figs. 3.29-3.30). Three rooms in Building Complex I in Area E were entirely covered, from wall to wall, 39</page><page sequence="63">CHAPTER 3 Fig. 3.28. Area G, the massive stone lining of the sides of the well. with closely packed stones creating a kind of "mosaic". In open courtyards, certain confined areas often had flat-stone paving (Figs. 3.31-3.33). Thresholds The entrance into a complex from outside, or from a courtyard into a room, was often paved with adjoining, flat basalt river pebbles of large to medium size. For the main entrance to Building Complex I, especially large basalt slabs were chosen (see Fig .3.1). In-house thresholds leading from a courtyard into a room were often constructed on top of the stone foundation of the wall (Fig. 3.2). Pavements of small angular stones A pavement constructed of small, densely packed, angular stones was found in Room G of Building Complex II in Area E (Fig. 3.34). In rooms, and especially in courtyards, the original floor level was composed of such stones (Figs. 3.4- 3.5). A small area was sometimes paved in this technique as an installation base (Figs. 3.33, 3.35). Surface of small rounded gravel stones The pavement of the road in Area E was made of a mixture of small, rounded gravel stones and mud plaster (Fig. 3.7). Fig. 3.29.

Area E, flat-stone pavement and standing stone on the circumference of Installation E230 in the courtyard of Building Complex II. Mud-plaster paving Thick or thin layers of mud plaster were used for surfacing both large areas, such as floors and street surfaces, and small confined areas, such as specific installations or activity areas (Fig. 3.36). Occasionally, two or more layers of mud were found on a pebble layer. Potsherds In one example, the floor of a rounded installation was paved with potsherds and stones (Fig. 3.18). Unpaved floors The natural ground on which human activities took place became a compacted surface over time, rich in organic debris together with flint, pottery and other finds. Such surfaces, often defined as beaten-earth floors, are the most common type of floor at the site. Thus, all other floors are exceptional and require an explanation as to their construction and purpose. INSTALLATIONS Postholes A feature comprising a circle of medium-sized pebbles with a diameter of 2CM-0 cm. can be interpreted as a posthole (Fig. 3.37). Such a definition is most appropriate when the feature lies approximately in the center of the room and there is no evidence (such as burnt material) of any other use of the feature. However, no direct evidence was discovered for the use of wooden or other posts. Hearths Hearths at Sha'ar Hagolan are more easily identified, owing to their distinct characteristics: shallow rounded pits surrounded or lined with stones, averaging 40-80 cm. in diameter (Figs. 3.38-3.40). Their function as a hearth is more evident when the inner area is filled with burnt material (stones, bricks or bones). However, burnt material 41</page><page sequence="65">CHAPTER 3 Fig. 3.33.

Mortars Large, deep mortars were made of elongated or rounded basalt boulders measuring around 40 x 60 cm. The outer face of the stone was usually left unworked. The mortars were sometimes 42</page><page sequence="66">YARMUKIAN BUILDING TECHNIQUES Fig. 3.37. Area E, Posthole E537 made of small rounded stones. Fig. 3.39. Area E, rounded Hearth E722. Fig. 3.38.

Four such installations were found in the open courtyard of Building Complex II in Area E. In one case, a circle of small angular stones surrounded the upper edge of the mortar (Fig. 3.41), probably to fix it in place and create a small working area around it. Grinding installations A grinding installation is a lower grinding stone, usually an elongated flat basalt slab 30-60 cm. long. The upper face is somewhat concave. One such installation was found in the open courtyard of Building Complex I in Area E, sunken below floor level, and another in the courtyard of Building Complex II in Area E, with small angular stones around it. 43</page><page sequence="67">CHAPTER 3 Fig. 3.41 .

TRADITIONAL MUDBRICK CONSTRUCTION IN THE JORDAN VALLEY The construction techniques evidenced in the Yarmukian village at Sha'ar Hagolan represent the work of accomplished craftsmen possessing a distinct and well-developed building tradition. This accords with the high level of complexity seen in the building plans and the village layout. This tradition of construction with stones and mud first appeared in the Jordan Fig. 3.42. 'Uja village: deserted mudbrick building. Fig. 3.43. 'Uja village: deserted mudbrick building. Fig. 3.44. 'Uja village: close-up of mudbrick wall. 44</page><page sequence="68">YARMUKIAN BUILDING TECHNIQUES Valley during the Natufian period, as reported at the site of 'Enan (Perrot 1993a: 391), and continued through the various stages of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic at sites such as Jericho (Kenyon 1981) and Netiv Hagdud (Bar-Yosef and Gopher 1997: 41-69, especially the well-preserved Loci 26 and 1001). In addition, a detailed account of Neolithic construction was published from the site of 'Ain Ghazal (Banning and Byrd 1987). This tradition has not, however, died out completely. Since modern-day architecture is based on steel and concrete, it is often hard for us to imagine what Neolithic buildings really looked like. In order to achieve a better understanding of traditional mud architecture, in 2001 we documented mud- built structures in the Arab village of 'Uja, near Jericho. Until the mid 1980s, all the structures in this village were built of mud, but in the last two decades they have been replaced by modern concrete buildings. The traditional mud houses in 'Uja were built of whitish mud originating from the local Lisan Formation (Figs. 3.42- 3.43). The bricks are rectangular (Fig. 3.44) and the walls are nearly 1 m. thick. Both sides of the walls were plastered, first with mud plaster mixed with straw, then with white lime. Each house has a doorway and windows that are lined with wooden frames to support the walls above the openings (Figs. 3.43, 3.45). We know of the existence of windows in Neolithic architecture from the buildings at Basta in Jordan, where the walls were preserved to a height of 3 m. and included small windows (Nissen et al. 1991). Some of the roofs were flat, while others were pitched. Roofs were constructed in three layers: 1 A grid-like wooden frame, with one massive wooden beam at the highest location in the center, lying directly on the walls without further support. On this main beam and the walls, medium-sized wooden beams were arranged in a grid pattern (Figs. 3.46-3.47). 2 A dense layer of reeds was laid on the wooden beams (Fig. 3.48). A similar construction, but for a floor, was reported from PPNB Jericho, located less than 10 km. south of 'Uja (Kenyon 1981: PL 49a-b). 3 Over the reeds was spread a relatively thin layer of mud that contained a high proportion of clay, as it was taken from the local Lisan Formation. There is ethnographic evidence that that such a mud sealant required regular treatment with a heavy stone roller before the rainy season (Aurenche 1981a: 149-156). Fig. 3.45.

The aim of these workshops was to gain a better understanding of both the ancient techniques and the site formation processes. In addition, they provided a different and interesting activity for the excavation's volunteers, some of whom were teenagers. Other workshops included pottery manufacture (Zuckerman 2002), which was carried out over several seasons, flint knapping, basketry and weaving. MUD ARCHITECTURE Mud is an almost universally available building material, used for the construction of large public structures, private houses, cooking ovens and kilns. In many countries, and in the Middle East in particular, mud architecture is common to this day, continuing a tradition of thousands of years. There are a number of advantages to building with mud. The raw material is easy to handle and readily available, and the building process does not require any special expertise or equipment. In warm climates, the bricks dry after a short time in the sun, with no need for fuel to fire the bricks, and become hard and stable. Thus, building with mud is a cheap alternative to building with more expensive materials such as stone and wood. In dry climates, especially if the building has a stone foundation and is well roofed, the structure will not collapse during the winter, as the dried bricks are waterproof and do not absorb moisture. Well-plastered and maintained mudbrick walls will stand for a long time. The major disadvantage of building with mud is the need for continuous maintenance, as each crack must be immediately repaired. In addition, old bricks, in contrast to stones, cannot be recycled for building material. In traditional villages, there is a clear association between The field workshop was conducted under the guidance of Reuven Elberger of the Israel Antiquities Authority, an expert in reconstruction and conservation of ancient brick structures. Pétrographie studies of pottery and mudbricks were carried out by Yuval Goren and Anat Cohen- Weinberger, whose assistance and observations were of great value for the current study. building in mud and the production of pottery and clay objects. In traditional villages in Iraq, Iran and Africa, mud is mixed in a large pit near a construction site (Mcintosh 1974: 158) and used as material for bricks, plaster for walls and roofs, and material for the maintenance of the pottery kilns, which are also built of sun-dried bricks. In the potter's village of el- Fustat in the southern part of Cairo, a clay tank near every workshop supplies clay for both the pottery and the brick and tile industries (Zuckerman 2004: 166). In southwestern Afghanistan, potters and brick makers work side by side in the vicinity of the clay pits (Matson 1974: 345). In recent years, a movement for more environment- friendly building that promotes building with natural raw materials has gained momentum, and many studies have been conducted (Houben and Guillaud 1994: 11). In the United States (California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado and Texas), Australia, Germany and Africa, centers specializing in mudbrick architecture have been established (Middleton 1991: 17). Experiments in this field have also been carried out in Israel, for example at Kibbutz Lotem in the Arava, where several mud buildings have been constructed. There are three main methods of building with mud around the world: BUILDING IN MUD CASTING (MUD AND STUD, WATTLE AND DAUB) In this technique, the wet mud is spread on both sides of a frame made of branches or straw, drying to form a stable wall. A similar technique is to fill with mud a space created within a double frame to attain a strong, thick wall. This technique is common in Iraqi villages near riverbanks and irrigation channels, areas rich in mud (Ochsenschlager 1974: 170). BUILDING IN MUD MIXTURE (COB) In this technique, a mud mixture is kneaded into large lumps. The builder stands on the wall and his assistants throw him the chunks, which he places in rows on the wall. Before placing a new row, the mud is allowed to partially dry. This method is still used today in West Africa and Yemen. BUILDING IN MUDBRICK (ADOBE BRICKS) The commonly used term for building in mudbrick, adobe , derives from Spanish. However, the source is the ancient 47</page><page sequence="70">CHAPTER 4 Egyptian word for mudbrick, djebet , which was transmitted into Arabic as tub(a), and thence to Spanish. This method is common to this day in many regions of the world including South and Central America, Africa and the Middle East. The bricks are formed of a plastic mud mixture containing up to 30% water. There are several variations of building in mudbrick: Wet bricks: The bricks are formed by hand and immediately placed on the wall. This was the method used in the Yarmukian buildings at Sha'ar Hagolan (see below). Dry bricks: The bricks are formed by hand or in a wooden mold, then removed and left in the sun to dry. The walls are constructed with dry bricks. Fired bricks.: After drying, the bricks are fired in a kiln. The walls are built of fired bricks affixed with wet plaster. This method requires large quantities of fuel, rendering the building process more expensive (Kemp 2000: 79). MUDBRICK CONSTRUCTION AT THE YARMUKIAN VILLAGE OF SHA6 AR HAGOLAN The well-planned Neolithic village of Sha'ar Hagolan, comprising twenty hectares of buildings, courtyards, open areas , streets , etc . , as described in this volume , was characterized by its diversified assemblage of vessels and objects made of the local clay. The Yarmukian people were well aware of the qualities of the local clay and utilized it to make pottery, figurines and other clay objects, as well as in the construction of buildings and installations. In a survey conducted in the vicinity of the archaeological site, we identified outcrops of clayey soil suitable for mudbricks (Zuckerman 2004: 152), based on previous studies of the composition of the clay and the clay sources at Sha'ar Hagolan (Goren 1991: 203). The buildings at Sha'ar Hagolan were made of local raw materials (basalt and limestone river pebbles and mud) that are abundant in the vicinity. Perishable materials such as wooden beams and reeds were used for support and roofing. The most common building material, mud, was shaped by hand to create rounded, plano-convex mudbricks. These were arranged in courses on top of stone foundations (see above, Figs. 3.8- 3.12). Although these walls were usually preserved only to a height of 0.20-0.50 m., the original height was probably 2 m. or more. Each of the large building complexes at Sha'ar Hagolan was constructed of hundreds of thousands of bricks. This estimate is based on six bricks per meter laid lengthwise in a row (each brick is about 0.12-0.20 m. long). Thick outer walls have at least five rows of bricks, while thinner inner walls have three to four rows. Thus, each meter of an outer wall represents 450 bricks, of an inner wall, 300 bricks. If the height of the walls is estimated at 2 m., of which the lower 0.5 m. is stone, the upper 1.5 m. would comprise some 15 courses of bricks. The estimate of the number of bricks used in Building I of Area E is over 42,000 (a total of 63.5 tons of wet mud based on 1-2 kg. per wet brick), in Building II of Area E, 73,800 (110.7 tons) and in Building I of Area H, 51,200 (76.9 tons). Therefore, at least 167,000 bricks were made for these buildings alone. If it takes about 30 seconds to make a brick, with two people working eight hours a day (one making the bricks and the other laying them), the superstructure of Building I in Area E, for example, would have taken about 44 working days to complete. THE EXPERIMENTAL MUDBRICK BUILDING WORKSHOP AT SHA4 AR HAGOLAN During the 2000 excavation season, we initiated the reconstruction of a mudbrick building within the archaeo- logical site. Work continued during the 2001-2002 seasons, in which the brick walls were preserved and maintained. Our aim was to study the step-by-step process of Neolithic mudbrick building techniques. The construction was carried out by the staff and volunteers of the excavation, based on the data obtained from the analyses outlined below. Before building commenced, several Neolithic bricks were studied to determine the nature of the raw material as compared to recent raw materials collected in the vicinity of the site. The shape, color, size and weight were noted, and pétrographie analysis and flotation were carried out. In addition, the imprints on the surfaces of the bricks were examined to establish the production method of the bricks and the building process of the walls. PETROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS The pétrographie analysis was conducted in the laboratory of the Israel Antiquities Authority by Y. Goren (1991) and A. Cohen-Weinberger (2002). The results indicate that the clay used for the larger mudbricks is similar to that of the cruder (coarse ware) pottery vessels, while a thin section of a smaller brick showed a resemblance to the fabric of the medium-sized pottery vessels. All the bricks contained organic temper (straw, reeds and dry leaves), which had disintegrated, leaving voids or imprints in the clay matrix, as well as inorganic inclusions (mostly basalt, limestone and shell fragments), which are found naturally in the local clay. The bricks were not fired. FLOTATION Flotation, or wet sieving, is a useful tool for identifying organic material or very small artifacts within archaeological sediments. Several mudbricks from Areas E, H and G underwent flotation during the 2000 season, along with recently-made bricks of local raw material. The results indicate that both the ancient and modern bricks contained pieces of basalt, limestone, shell, flint and tiny river pebbles. SHAPE The Neolithic mudbricks were rounded and roughly bun- shaped. They were shaped from a wet lump of mud between the hands. After drying, the surface became hard, while the inner part was soft and brittle. COLOR The color of the Neolithic bricks was various shades of pale gray (10YR 7/1-10YR 7/2 in the Munsell soil-color charts), the same color as the soil and the debris at the archaeological site. SIZE AND WEIGHT The Neolithic bricks varied in size: some of the smaller bricks 48</page><page sequence="71">EXPERIMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY AT SHA' AR HAGOLAN: RECONSTRUCTION OF A MUDBRICK STRUCTURE weighed 100 grams or less, medium-sized bricks weighed 200 grams or more, while some of the larger bricks weighed over 1 kg. Some of the walls contained bricks of varying sizes, and it seems that the reason may be the various sizes of the many hands that took part in the mudbrick building process. The experimental building was erected in the following stages: (a) measuring and marking out the limits of the structure; (b) collecting the raw mud near the water source; (c) preparing the mud mixture for the bricks; (d) building the stone foundation; (e) forming the bricks and building the brick walls; (f) paving the floor; (g) roofing; (h) plastering the walls and the roof. In addition, certain maintenance procedures took place in the first three years after construction. Before the actual building commenced, it became apparent that in order to produce the large amount of bricks required, a large work force would be needed. Therefore, each area of the excavation supplied staff and volunteers for this project by daily rotation. Thus, the large mudbrick buildings at the Yarmukian village of Sha'ar Hagolan reflect the social organization of the population (Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo 2002a: 69). MEASURING AND MARKING OUT THE LIMITS OF THE STRUCTURE An area near the northern edge of Area E measuring 2 x 1 m. was marked out by reed poles; the structure was intended to be 1.6 m. high. COLLECTING THE RAW MUD NEAR THE WATER SOURCE Building a structure from mudbricks requires a very large quantity of raw clay. Vitruvius, a Roman architect and engineer who lived in the first century CE, described the selection of raw clay for brick building: "Beginning with bricks, I shall state of what kind of clay they ought to be made. They should be not made of sandy or pebbly clay or of fine gravel, because when made of these kinds they are in the first place heavy; and, secondly, when washed by the rain as they stand in walls, they go to pieces and break up, and the straw in them does not hold together on account of the roughness of the material. They should rather be made of white and chalky or red clay, or even of a coarse grained gravelly clay. These materials are smooth and therefore durable; they are not heavy to work with, and are readily laid" (Vitruvius, Book II, Chapter III: 42^-3). In order to find suitable raw material for brick making, soil was collected from three excavation areas (E, G and H) and several probes within the site. The suitability of the material for mudbrick preparation was examined in the field according to several parameters, as outlined in Table 4.1 , which compares raw materials collected from Areas E and H. Based on these comparisons, the clays from Samples E3 and HI were found to be suitable for brick making and were collected for this purpose. As the production of mudbricks requires a nearby water source, the proximity of the site to the Yarmuk River could have provided the necessary water in a number of ways: a) The Neolithic people carried water in containers from the river to the site within the settlement where bricks were made. b) The bricks were made near the river and then brought to the building site. Based on our experience, the bricks were laid while wet, and thus this possibility seems unlikely. c) The well uncovered in Area G may have supplied water for brick making as well as for pottery manufacture. PREPARING THE MUD FOR THE BRICKS Several rounded, shallow pits were dug and filled with water (Fig. 4.1). The raw material (HI and E3) was added to the water and mixed with hands and feet. Volunteers and kibbutz members, who enjoyed treading barefoot in the mud, happily took part. As opposed to the preparation of clay for pottery making, there is no need for any additional treatment or kneading of the clay. Although the mud contained chunks of clay, pieces of flint and basalt and organic material, it was not cleaned or levigated, nor was any material such as straw or dung added, since no evidence of this was observed in the Neolithic bricks. The mud was left to settle for 24 hours, and excess water either evaporated or permeated into the ground. Fig. 4.1 . Preparation of the clay. Table 4.1 . Types of clay at Sha'ar Hagolan.

The stone foundations constructed of rounded basalt river pebbles. In the photograph a few courses of bricks have been placed on top of the stones. Some water was added later when necessary. The mud was then checked every hour and used when it was sufficiently plastic. BUILDING THE STONE FOUNDATION The foundations of the Neolithic walls were made of several courses of rounded river pebbles, mostly basalt with some limestone. These pebbles are common on the surface of the site and especially near the river. The foundation courses comprised two straight lines of large river pebbles laid on the ground without digging a foundation trench, and smaller pebbles filled in between. The stone foundations protected the brick walls from water on the ground. The height of the stone foundations excavated at the site varied from wall to wall, ranging from one to six courses of stones, usually without any mud fill between the stones. Any addition of mud to the foundation would have caused water to be absorbed into the wall. The patches of mud that were occasionally preserved between the stones may have been plaster from the wall rather than part of the stone foundation itself. In several walls , remains of a mud core mixed with small pebbles were observed within and on the stone foundation. In a number of walls, the pattern of the stone laying can be discerned. In the first stage stones were laid along the edges of the wall, and then the central core was filled. The larger pebbles created the necessary stability and the smaller ones filled the gaps. However, in general the construction was not uniform and large and small pebbles were used interchangeably. In the course of the reconstruction work, many basalt and limestone pebbles of various sizes were collected, requiring a considerable physical effort. After a large pile of stones was accumulated at the building site, construction of the foundation walls commenced. A shallow trench was dug, 0.15 m. deep, and the soil in the area was moistened in order to stabilize the first course of stones. The foundation walls were built four courses high (0.50 m.) and 0.30 m. wide (Fig. 4.2). Fig. 4.3. Collecting the mud from the clay pit. Fig. 4.4. Preparing a rounded brick by hand. FORMING THE BRICKS AND BUILDING THE BRICK WALLS Examination of the Neolithic bricks revealed depressions in their bases, located at the point of attachment to the brick underneath. This led us to assume that construction was carried out with wet bricks, thus eliminating the necessity for any plaster as a binding material. Each course of bricks was affixed to the course below it, resulting when dry in a stable and uniform wall. However, building with wet bricks requires many hands working simultaneously before the bricks become too dry, further evidence that the Yarmukian people were sufficiently well organized to build large structures. During the reconstruction, which lasted for three weeks, a large number of people participated in the work of brick making and laying. At first, work was slow, but as people achieved more skill in making the bricks and laying them on the walls, the pace of work accelerated. Each person took a handful of mud from the mud pit (Fig. 4.3), created a rounded brick (Fig. 4.4) and laid it immediately on the wall (Fig. 4.5); this sequence was repeated over and over. The surface of the brick was smoothed with wet hands, creating after drying a hard surface and a softer, 50</page><page sequence="73">EXPERIMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY AT SHA' AR HAGOLAN: RECONSTRUCTION OF A MUDBRICK STRUCTURE Fig. 4.5. General view of the workshop area. brittle core, as observed in the Neolithic bricks. The adults participating in the reconstruction made larger bricks, while children made smaller ones, thus accounting for the various sizes of bricks in the walls. Another factor contributing to varying brick size was the differing amount of water in the daily mud mixtures, which influenced the degree of shrinkage of the bricks after drying. Prior to laying a new course of bricks, we allowed a short time for partial drying of the bricks to prevent deformation or collapse of the lower courses under the weight of the upper ones. The brick acquired a depression from the shape of the brick below it, the lower edges were flattened and the clay that was smeared filled the gaps between the bricks. The upper surface of the brick always remained rounded (Fig. 4.6). Based on our observations of the Neolithic walls, we first laid the external rows of bricks and then worked our way inward, thus creating a uniform outer face that contributed to its stability. A long upright reed assisted in maintaining a vertically straight wall (Fig. 4.7), as the line of the irregularly shaped, handmade bricks easily became irregular, especially at the corners. Work was stopped from time to time in order Fig. 4.6. Close-up of the bricks in the wall. to examine the wall, as during the construction process it is difficult to control such irregularities, which cannot be corrected after the bricks have dried. In some cases, we remade courses or bricks that were out of line. After several courses of bricks, a layer of cut straw was laid to make the wall more flexible. In a description of mudbrick building from the tomb of Rekhmire in Thebes (Egyptian New Kingdom, 1470-1445 BCE), a layer of yellow straw can be seen separating the brick courses (Davies 1943: Pl. VII). Experience is an important factor in efficient building methods. Thus, the large-scale building activities at Sha'ar Hagolan must have produced experts who assisted in the planning and constructing. PAVING THE FLOOR Several types of flooring were uncovered in the excavations: paving with one or more layers of flat river pebbles, paving with small cobbles, floors of mud plaster and beaten-earth floors. The stone-paved rooms are assumed to be storage units (Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo 2002a: 57). In traditional mud architecture, the earthen floor is strengthened by adding manure, animal blood or ash (Houben and Guillaud 1994: 273). We chose to reconstruct a beaten- earth floor comprising a well-flattened layer of beaten earth mixed with manure powder. The floor reached the base of the walls' stone foundations but was separate from them (this is critical for the stability of the structure). ROOFING As only the lower parts of the Neolithic buildings were preserved, the reconstruction of the roofing is highly speculative. However, several flattened pieces of mud bearing straw imprints recovered from the excavations could have been part of collapsed roofs. Only a few postholes were identified in the buildings. Flat dirt roofs are common in warm climates. However, this type of roof is very sensitive to water and can collapse after heavy rains. To protect the roof, manure and/or straw can be added to the mud used for the roofing. Ethnographic evidence from African villages indicates that mudbrick walls with well-constructed roofing can last for six to seven years 51</page><page sequence="74">CHAPTER 4 Fig. 4.7. Reeds placed vertically beside the walls to aid in maintaining a consistent thickness. without any repairs. However, without adequate roofing such walls will last only two to three years at the most (Mcintosh 1974: 158). In the reconstruction work, a stable framework of reeds was laid on top of the upper courses of the walls, interwoven with reeds (Fig. 4.8). Two layers of liquid mud plaster mixed with a large quantity of chopped straw were poured onto this reed framework (Fig. 4.9). The roof thus created was durable and waterproof, but very heavy. Similar roofs are common in mudbrick structures in the Middle East, and require frequent maintenance. PLASTERING THE WALLS AND THE ROOF The complete reconstructed building can be seen in Fig. 4.10.

Fig. 4.11. Close-up of the wall. Some of the bricks cracked during the drying process, lending the walls a coarse surface (Fig. 4.11). As noted above, one of the main disadvantages of mudbrick walls is the need for frequent, almost daily, maintenance. In order to protect the walls from rain and wind, as repeated wetting and drying of the bricks cause their gradual deterioration, and from wear due to sandstorms and human usage, the walls were plastered with very wet mud, either by hand or with the use of a wooden smoothening tool, creating a thick, uniform layer over the bricks. As well as protecting the bricks from mechanical wear, the plaster also has an aesthetic value. It is possible that the plastering was done by the women who lived in the house and were responsible for the maintenance of the building. In Nigeria, houses several stories high are built of mudbrick and after plastering are decorated with elaborate, colorful geometric patterns (Houben and Guillaud 1994: 180). The houses at Sha'ar Hagolan may also have been decorated with either plastic or colored decoration, perhaps with the typical Yarmukian herringbone pattern. However, the few pieces of plaster recovered from the excavations teach us very little about the outer appearance of the Yarmukian houses. The reconstructed building had thick, stable walls that maintained a cool atmosphere inside on even the hottest summer day, and also provided protection from the cold, wet winters. During excavation seasons, we re-plastered the walls whenever a crack was observed, filling the crevices with mud. MAINTENANCE OF THE RECONSTRUCTED STRUCTURE AFTER ONE, TWO AND THREE YEARS The mudbrick structure was completed in the season of 2000 and was still standing at the time of writing (2004). During the 2001, 2002 and 2003 excavation seasons, maintenance measures included re-plastering the walls and repairing the roof (Fig. 4.12). The structure endured the winter rains, the stone foundations preventing damage to the lower mudbrick courses. After the winter, the bricks were generally well preserved, though most had some cracks, and the walls stood upright without any signs of damage. Nevertheless, the winter rains damaged the mud plaster coating the bricks, causing pieces to break off, and part of the roof collapsed due to the weather as well as the weight of the roof itself. In the severe winter of 2004, when heavy rainfall affected the region, our mudbrick building suffered greatly: even larger sections of the roof collapsed and the outer layer of the walls crumbled (Fig. 4.13). Presumably, an inhabited building would have been repaired immediately to prevent further damage. In conclusion, it can be said that while the walls and bricks themselves are very durable in both dry and wet weather, the roof needs attention and every fracture must be repaired immediately. COMPLEMENTARY EXPERIMENTAL WORKSHOPS Experimental workshops in reed weaving and basketry and their relation to pottery making and the preparation of roofing, as well as their use as partition walls, were conducted during the 1998-2002 seasons (Zuckerman 2002), lending some indication as to the types of raw materials that may have been used by the inhabitants. In other workshops we explored the preparation of pigments from ochre, as well as the use of working tools made from bone, flint and sherds. We learned how the same materials could be used for various functions: local clay for building and pottery making, and reeds for basketry, mats, constructional frames and roofing, as well as 53</page><page sequence="76">CHAPTER 4 Fig. 4.12. Replastering the wall after a year. Fig. 4.13. The crumbled mudbrick structure in the summer of 2004. for working tools and fuel. Sharp flint tools or blades could easily be used for incising on pottery, while small smooth pebbles may have functioned as burnishing tools. CONCLUSIONS The reconstructed mudbrick structure stands near the remains of the Neolithic buildings and the excavation results guided us in the reconstruction work, from the collection and preparation of the building materials to the preparation of the bricks and the building of the walls. The bricks are identical in shape, size and color to the ancient bricks, and the roofing and plastering of the walls were also carried out using the same methods as those of the builders in the 6th millennium BCE. It should be noted, however, that as the workshop focused on the process of construction, the reconstruction is not an exact copy of any of the houses actually found in the excavation. The work was executed in the same location and conditions that existed during the Neolithic period, and thus the solutions that we devised are presumably similar to those of the Neolithic builders. The experimental mudbrick building workshop at Sha'ar Hagolan taught us many things that the archaeological remains alone could not, such as the advantages of the various alternatives for raw material, and provided new insights into the stages of the building process and possible problems to be encountered, such as the mud drying in the midst of the work, cracks in walls, fallen bricks, collapsing of the roof or water washing away the structure's floor. Most importantly, we realized the extent of planning and physical effort needed for the construction of such buildings in a hot climate. From our experience of working together in a group to erect a modest structure under the prevalent conditions, we can extrapolate the effort and social organization necessary to erect the large-scale complexes unearthed at the Neolithic site. Even the small structure that we built required some 6000 mudbricks. This fact raises questions with regard to social organization. Who was in charge of collecting the raw material? How did the village people organize the preparation of such large quantities of bricks? What was the division of labor between the sexes? Was there gender- oriented labor specialization in regard to wall plastering and daily maintenance of the structures? The mudbrick building workshop also revealed that the walls were made with still- wet bricks, the lower part of the wet brick acquiring the shape of the brick below it and thus binding well. The bricks dry rapidly and the walls are strong and stable. This method does not require any straw, save for the roofing. In Jericho, on the other hand, the walls were built of bun- shaped bricks that were sun-dried in advance (Kenyon 1957). The Yarmukian people of Sha'ar Hagolan may have learned the advantages of this building method in the course of their extensive building activities in the village. As a considerable part of the village population was involved in pottery making, potters may also have been involved in mudbrick production and house building, applying to building with wet bricks their knowledge and experience of the advantages of working with wet clay. Though no evidence of decorated plaster was recovered 54</page><page sequence="77">EXPERIMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY AT SHA4 AR HAGOLAN: RECONSTRUCTION OF A MUDBRICK STRUCTURE in the excavation, the question arises as to the existence and nature of decorations on the houses. The patterns may have been similar to those seen on the Yarmukian pottery. A close relationship between ceramic decorative motifs and decorations on mudbrick house walls, the latter performed by women, is reported in studies of recent traditional societies (Vincentelli 2000: 41). Our reconstructed building, standing in the midst of the ancient site, enables the visitor to envisage the Neolithic houses that stood in the same spot eight thousand years ago. 55</page><page sequence="78">CHAPTER 5 THE WELL Y. Garfinkel and A. Ver ed NEOLITHIC WELLS IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST A reliable source of drinking water is the most basic requirement for human survival. Hence, throughout the history of mankind, both temporary encampments and sedentary settlements were located near or within a short walking distance of a permanent water source such as a spring, river or freshwater lake. The construction of water installations, including wells, dams and channels, is widely documented archaeologically from at least 5500 years ago. In recent years, systematic excavations at early Neolithic sites (PPNB-PPNC) in the Levant have exposed large numbers of water wells dating to 9500-8000 years ago. This is an additional and rather unexpected aspect of human activities resulting from the Neolithic revolution. Alongside the developments in plant cultivation and animal husbandry of goats, sheep, cattle, etc., which eventually led to their domestication, and the redesigning of domestic and public spaces, securing stable water sources was initiated as an integral part of the construction of new settlements. The active digging of wells to reach the underground water table reflects an innovative approach to water management in sedentary communities and is testimony to the hydrological knowledge and technological capabilities of early Neolithic farmers in the Near East. The earliest Neolithic wells, dated to ca. 9,500 BP, were uncovered at two Cypriot sites: Kissonerga-Mylouthkia and Shillourocambous (Fig. 5.1). At Kissonerga-Mylouthkia, near the western coast of Cyprus, two shafts dug into the sandstone were exposed (Peltenburg 2003; Peltenburg et al. 2000, 2001), each approximately 2 m. in diameter and preserved to a depth of 7-8 m. Since erosion and modern quarrying have destroyed the upper parts of the wells, the original depth is unknown. No additional construction was involved in shaping these simple rock-cut shafts. At Shillourocambous, located further inland in southern Cyprus, three wells were reported (Guilaine and Briois 2001:41, Structures 2, 66, 114). To date, little information has been published on these wells, which were cut into the rock like those of Kissonerga-Mylouthkia (for a section of Structure 66, see Guilaine et al. 1999: Fig. 1). Three wells were reported from the underwater site of 4 Atlit Yam near the Mediterranean coast of Israel (dating from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C, ca. 7000 BCE; Galili 1993; Galili and Sharvit 1998; Galili et al. 2002), but only one of them has been Mg. 5.1 . Location ot Neolithic wells in the ancient JNear bast. described in detail (Galili and Nir 1993). The current location of this well is 12 m. below sea level. Underwater excavation imposed severe limitations, confining the work to the inner part of this installation. This well is ca. 1 .5 m. in diameter and 5.7 m. deep, and is lined with stones to a depth of 4.2 m. The lower 1.5 m . were hewn directly into the sandstone bedrock. The well shaft was filled with numerous animal bones, flint artifacts and plant remains (Galili and Nir 1993). The discovery of a well at the Pottery Neolithic site of Sha'ar Hagolan in the central Jordan Valley adds another level to our knowledge of the development of hydrological technology. 57 / J t Shillourocambous 1 J Kissoneiga t X / Mylouthkia J ' / 4 mf m Sha'ar ť Atlit Yany Hagolan / Á</page><page sequence="79">CHAPTER 5 THE WELL AT SHA6 AR HAGOLAN EXCAVATING THE WELL The well was discovered at the end of the 2002 season at the base of Area G, probably in the center of thè settlement Fig. 5.2. Area G, the location of the well. (Figs. 5.2-5.3, see also Color Plates IXa-b), and completely uncovered during the 2003 season. In the 2002 season the dimensions of the well became clear: the inner diameter of the shaft is 0.5 m., the outer diameter of the stone construction is ca. 1.2 m., and the well was built within a pit 2 m. in diameter at the top. In this season we excavated inside the shaft to a depth of 1 m., but we were unable to continue manually because of the small diameter (Fig. 5.4). The strategy adopted in the 2003 season was to excavate the well from its southern, outer side, according to the following technical steps: 1 A large pit was dug with a backhoe into the virgin soil adjacent to the well (Fig. 5.5). As we did not know the well's depth, we began with a pit 2 m.deep. 2 We then excavated manually, straightening the backhoe trench and creating a section into the Lisan Formation (Fig. 5.6, Color Plate IXc). 3 We cut through the Lisan and exposed a section of the well's foundation pit (Fig. 5.7). 4 The entire southern side of the well's foundation pit was exposed (Fig. 5.8). 5 The well's foundation pit was excavated to the outside of the stone lining, initially in a narrow section (Fig. 5.9). 6 The fill of the southern half of the foundation pit was gradually removed. First the eastern part was unearthed (Fig. 5.10), then the remainder, until we obtained a cross- section of the upper 2 m. of the installation (Fig. 5.11; Color Plate Xa). It became clear that the installation continued downward. 7 At this stage , a deeper pit was dug mechanically by backhoe into the virgin soil adjacent to the well (Fig. 5.12). When the work was finished, the soil was dry, but in less than 15 minutes water had begun to accumulate at the bottom of the pit. 8 We then excavated manually and exposed the entire outer face of the stone lining (Fig. 5.13). The lower part of the stone-lined shaft was built directly into the Lisan without a wider foundation pit (Fig. 5.14). Further down, the shaft had no stone lining (Fig. 5.15). Fig. 5.3.

Area G, the Lisan Formation into which the well was dug. 9 In order to obtain a cross-section of the well, the southern wall of the stone lining was removed (Fig. 5.16). The dismantled stones were stored in a large plastic container for possible future reconstruction of the well (Fig. 5.17). 10 The inner fill of the well shaft was straightened to obtain a cross-section of the well (Fig. 5.18). 1 1 The section was drawn and photographed (Figs .5.1 9-5 .20; Color Plate Xb). 12 The inner fill of the entire upper part of the shaft was cleared. A variety of finds were recovered, such as pottery, animal bones and flint, including a large number of flint axes (Fig. 5.21). The inner face of the northern wall of the shaft construction was completely uncovered (Figs. 5.22-5.23). The lower part of the fill was very wet, and the sediments had to be dried in the sun before sieving. 13 At the end of the 2003 season, Area G was backfilled. The remains of the well were covered with black geo-textile and completely buried (Fig. 5.24). THE WELL IN NEOLITHIC TIMES The information gleaned from the excavation of the well provided clear indications that it was constructed in three main stages: digging, construction and backfilling. First, a stepped foundation pit was dug directly into the virgin soil. It cut through 0.5 m. of local river pebbles and sandy Yarmuk River delta sediment, then below these into the Lisan Formation, a whitish Pleistocene lacustrine clay sediment. The diameter of the pit narrows from ca. 2 m. (0-2 m. depth), to ca. 1.2 m. (2-2.75 m. depth), and finally ca. 0.7 m. (2.75^.26 m. depth). At its base (4.26 m.) the pit reaches water, which flows from a layer of fine reddish gravel, 0.15 m. thick, deposited within the Lisan clay (Fig. 5.25). As the well shaft ends exactly at this reddish level, it was presumably the water source in Neolithic times. The water accumulates at the base of the well to a height of nearly 1 m. This is precisely the top of the "mushroom- shaped" widening that can be observed in the shaft at a depth of 3.3-3.8 m. (Fig. 5.26), which seems to have been created by continued use of the well and not as an intentional construction. The flow of water probably created local waves that over the years nibbled into the sides of the shaft. In the next stage, the stone lining was constructed. The stones line only the upper 2.5 m. of the well and do not reach its bottom, probably to enable the cleaning of the well from time to time. A similar feature was observed at 'Atlit Yam, 59</page><page sequence="81">CHAPTER 5 Fig. 5.7. Area G, a cut through the Lisan Formation exposing a section of the well's foundation pit. Fig. 5.9.

The lower part of the lining (ca. 0.5 m.) was laid directly against the walls of the pit dug into the Lisan Formation. Large elongated basalt river pebbles were carefully chosen and laid with their narrow side facing inward to the shaft. Fig. 5.12. Area G, the second mechanical operation, digging deeper on the southern side of the well. Fig. 5.13. Area G, the outer southern face of the stone lining is completely exposed. Above this, the stone lining was built in the foundation pit and the gap between the lining and the pit's edge was backfilled. The stone construction and the backfilling were carried out simultaneously, probably two or three stone courses at a time. This would have created a working platform for the builders, as well as stabilizing the stone construction. The sediment used for the backfilling of the pit was dark, rich in organic material, and mixed with knapped flint, broken pottery and animal bones, clearly anthropogenic sediment and not the original whitish Lisan clay. This clay was valued by the Neolithic inhabitants, who used it for the production of bricks and pottery. The stages of the well construction are summarized in Fig. 5.27. DISCUSSION The detailed analysis of the well at Sha'ar Hagolan has clarified several aspects of well construction in the Neolithic period. Geographically, its location in the Jordan Valley, as opposed to those at Kissonerga-Mylouthkia and Shillourocambous in Cyprus and 'Atlif Yam (all on or close to the Mediterranean coast), indicates that such installations were also constructed 61</page><page sequence="83">CHAPTER 5 Mg. 5.14.

These Neolithic wells show that the interaction of the Neolithic people with their environment encompassed not only plants, animals, raw materials for making tools, objects and constructions, but also hydrological and geological knowledge. They had the technological capabilities to dig water wells from the surface into aquifers, thus reaching the 62</page><page sequence="84">THE WELL Fig. 5.18. Area G, excavating the fill inside the well shaft. Fig. 5.19. Area G, a cross-section of the well. water table. This clear expression of their engineering abilities was another step towards the domestication of their landscape. The water from the well was probably intended for human and animal use rather than for irrigation. Nevertheless, wells enable the settlement of semi-arid regions and exploitation of areas that suffer from annual or seasonal water shortages. This is a critical aspect of survival in the Mediterranean climate of the Middle East, where precipitation occurs only during the winter months. The removal of the major ecological barrier of water shortages and the availability of a reliable water supply facilitated the occupation of areas that had not been inhabited previously, and promoted a pastoral economy, thus increasing the carrying capacity of larger parts of the ancient Near East and stimulating population growth. A two-step pattern of human control of water resources is suggested here. The initial phase began some 9000 years ago, when wells were dug to provide water for humans and animals. Subsequently, some 5500 years ago, a higher level of water control was achieved through the digging of irrigation channels (Adams 1965; Butzer 1976). This development stimulated the cultivation of arid lands and intensified crop production. These far-reaching technological developments contributed directly to mounting population growth and regional densities, which in time became an important factor in the rise of civilization. 63</page><page sequence="85">CHAPTER 5 Fig. 5.20.

In preparation are additional monographs on each of the following subjects: pottery and baked clay objects, flint and obsidian, stone tools, art objects, faunai and botanical remains. In order to facilitate the publication of the discoveries at Sha'ar Hagolan, the policy of the Sha'ar Hagolan expedition is to concentrate mainly on the technical data, which in itself requires tremendous efforts, and to publish within a reasonable time frame. We would like to emphasize that, for us, technical field observations made during excavation are the basic data of archaeology as a science, data that should be presented objectively and in as detailed a manner as possible (see, for example, Garfinkel 1992, 1995; Garfinkel and Miller 2002; Garfinkel and Dag 2007, 2008). Accompanying interpretations, by their nature subjective, should be minimal. Interpretations are, of course, the main mechanism for advancing our understanding of the past, and may be presented in independent publications (see, for example, Garfinkel 1999a, 2003a), and thus present no further delays to the publication process. As we know, theories, like fashions, follow trends, and furthermore, theories can easily create bias in the presentation of data. Final excavation reports should stand alone and thus preserve their relevance for generations to come. This report provides the detailed descriptive, objective, factual basis, together with direct functional interpretations of the finds when relevant. However, broader theoretical interpretive aspects relating to the archaeological finds and the Neolithic period are not perceived as the main aim of this report. In accordance with the approach outlined above, we have concentrated our interpretive efforts on a limited number of aspects that we believe form the main contribution of the renewed excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan. These relate, in particular, to the theme that forms the title of this volume, The Rise of Urban Concepts , as reflected in the house plans and the village layout and infrastructure. These discussions are presented here in a brief manner, despite the potential further expansion of each topic. We invite our readers and reviewers to feel free to elaborate upon any of the subjects presented below. SHA'AR HAGOLAN: A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE POTTERY NEOLITHIC OF THE SOUTHERN LEVANT The Pottery Neolithic period of the southern Levant has traditionally been a neglected field of research that falls between two disciplines: prehistoric archaeology on the one hand and biblical archaeology on the other. For the prehistorians it is too late, while for the biblical archaeologists it is simply too early. This vacuum of modern research has been taken as a reflection of the actual circumstances of the period, or in the words of Bar-Yosef, "Part of the blame for the fragmentary data may be placed on the character of the remains themselves" (1992b: 31). Thus, modern research has created a false impression of most aspects of this period. Stekelis, the first excavator of Sha'ar Hagolan, found no evidence of architecture at the site. He wrote: "For objective reasons all we were able to discover of the village was two huts, and our conclusions and the following description are based only on this discovery." He later summarized: "The Neolithic settlers of Sha'ar Hagolan apparently lived in circular huts, half sunk below ground level. The roofs were made of organic material; the floors of terre pisée. In the centre of each hut there was a hearth, sunk in the floor, surrounded by a ring of small stones" (Stekelis 1972: 57). Excavations carried out at other Yarmukian sites also uncovered no traces of construction. In 1952, Kaplan excavated an area of approximately 500 sq. m. at the site of Habashan Street in Tel Aviv. He uncovered some twenty pits, pottery vessels, flint tools and figurines, but no remains of buildings (Kaplan 1959; Kaplan and Ritter-Kaplan 1993). In 1964 he excavated a Pottery Neolithic site at Hamadiya in the Jordan Valley and once again found pits and depressions in the rock, but no evidence of construction (Kaplan 1993). A similar picture arose from the excavations of other sites dated to the Pottery Neolithic period such as Teluliyot Batash (Kaplan 1958) and Lod (Kaplan 1977). The same situation was revealed in the excavations at Jericho. In the first account of her excavations, Kenyon entitled the chapter on the Pottery Neolithic period "A Retrogression," and stated that the "newcomers brought with them the use of pottery, but in every other respect they were much more primitive than their predecessors" (1957: 77). In her summary on the archaeology of the Holy Land, she emphasized two points that were subsequently repeated by most scholars dealing with this period (Kenyon 1960: 58-68): 67</page><page sequence="88">CHAPTER 6 1 The Pottery Neolithic marks a sharp cultural decline as compared with the earlier Pre-Pottery Neolithic periods: "This way of life was undoubtedly a retrogression as far as Palestine, as represented by Jericho, was concerned. Nothing on the scale of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A and B towns of Jericho is found. For some reason, the light of progress seems to flicker out. It is possible that the town- dwellers had become decadent, and fell victims to more barbarous elements." 2 The Pottery Neolithic of the southern Levant is much less culturally complex than other, contemporary cultures of the ancient Near East. In 1962-1967, Perrot excavated a large area of approximately 2000 sq. m. at Munhata (Perrot 1964, 1966a). In the Yarmukian occupation levels the poor remains of five round structures and large open areas containing about fifty round pits were exposed (Garfinkel 1992: Figs. 3-7). Perrot concluded that this area suffered a severe break in its settlement history and was abandoned for nearly a millennium (Perrot 1968, 1969). In Kirkbride's summary of the period, the Pottery Neolithic period was described thus: "The pit dwelling settlements of these people who, until Wadi Rabah and late Jericho VIII, appeared to have no solid architecture point to a semi-nomadic way of life in Palestine." She adds that the southern Levant only faintly mirrored the flourishing northern cultures (1971: 282). As recently as 1997, in a discussion on settlement development from late prehistory until the Iron Age, the following description of the Pottery Neolithic period appeared: "At the beginning of the sixth millennium B.C.E. a major breakdown of the Early Neolithic culture occurred in the southern Levant while prosperity continued in the northern parts of the Near East. The collapse is evident from the disintegration of all major settlements and the erection of small villages. The dominant dwelling form in this period is the circular house; in most cases these were only circular pits that formed the lower part of huts. In other instances only remains of floors, fireplaces and shallow pits pointed to the existence of huts or tents constructed from organic, perishable materials. Interestingly, this decline in settlement architecture is concomitant with the first appearance of pottery in the history of ancient Israel. The transition of the pattern of settlement from large villages of multi-roomed rectangular houses in the PPNB to the small hamlets of pits and huts in the Pottery Neolithic Period clearly indicates that the process of social change in Israel is non unilineal evolution. It appears that the climatic crisis at the beginning of the period forced the communities to abandon previous sites and led to their dispersion into smaller groups of polygynous families that preferred the circular hut, as did their ancestors of the PPNA in the eighth millennium B.C.E." (Herzog 1997: 27-29). In another recent discussion of the period, Bar-Yosef wrote: "The emerging picture of the spatial distribution of Pottery Neolithic 'cultures' , such as the Yarmoukian. . . conveys a well- spread population, small villages, hamlets, [and] temporary campsites . . . The overall picture does not change with the dominant Wadi Rabah culture of the next phase. The 'grandeur' of the PPNB days is over. The main economic powers at this time are in the northern Levant, Anatolia, and northern Mesopotamia. Although there was no gap in the population history, the people of the southern Levant definitely became 'marginal' to the powerful social organizations further north" (Bar-Yosef 1998: 170-171). Even in an article published in 2000, the Pottery Neolithic settlements are erroneously presented as equal in size to Natufian and PPNA sites (Kuijt 2000: Fig. 4). This researcher wrote: "The transition to small Pottery Neolithic hamlets containing fewer than a hundred people, reflects a process of decentralization and social fragmentation" (Kuijt 2000: 99). Thus, we see that according to the accepted scholarly consensus up to the late 1990s, the population of the Pottery Neolithic period was organized in small, semi-nomadic groups that inhabited each site only part of the year, and occupied pit dwellings or circular huts (Perrot 1968; Kirkbride 1971; Bar- Yosef 1992b: 31-38). This paradigm must now be completely transformed. Our new excavations at Sha'ar Hagolan have revealed a 20-hectare site with large, densely constructed building complexes made up of rooms around a courtyard, arranged along streets. This architectural plan reveals an advanced concept of space division, including roofed rooms, enclosed open courtyards, open areas and formalized passageways. The former picture of "degenerate clusters of pit dwellings" in the Pottery Neolithic of the southern Levant, which was based mainly on fragmentary evidence from small-scale excavations, has been completely disproved. On the contrary, Sha'ar Hagolan can be numbered among the major centers of civilization of its time, and a number of aspects of this settlement have direct links to the rise of urban concepts in the ancient Near East, reflecting a marked increase in social complexity. Thus, a logical, evolutionary development can be identified from the advent of agriculture to the beginning of urbanization. This process took place over a period of about 6000 years, and the Yarmukian culture represented at Sha'ar Hagolan stands roughly in the middle of this period, midway in the process of transition from the first sedentary settlements to urban centers. SITE SIZE AND SETTLEMENT HIERARCHY IN THE NEOLITHIC OF THE SOUTHERN LEVANT What we view as the most important characteristic of the settlement at Sha'ar Hagolan, the one that influenced all other cultural aspects such as social organization, architecture, settlement infrastructure and the rich art assemblage, is the size of the community. Late Pre-Pottery and Pottery Neolithic villages in the Near East usually ranged in size between 2 and 5 hectares, with exceptional sites such as Basta, 'Ain Ghazal and Çatal Hiiyíik ranging between 12 and 16 hectares. Thus, the 20-hectare-site of Sha'ar Hagolan is a rare phenomenon in the region. In his recent discussion of site size and hierarchy in the Neolithic of the ancient Near East, Hole concluded that "the concept of site 'hierarchy' may not be applicable to Pre- Pottery Neolithic B sites" (2000: 206). Hole follows the basic approach that was common till the mid 1980s, which assumed that the Neolithic social organization was egalitarian (Redman 68</page><page sequence="89">DISCUSSION: THE RISE OF URBAN CONCEPTS IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST 1977). This view has changed in the last twenty years. One of the first studies to offer archaeological evidence of social stratification in the Neolithic village dealt with the distribution of burnt lime products in various houses (Garfinkel 1987a). Excavations at the PPNA cultic center of Göbekli Tepe (Schmidt 1998, 2002, 2003) have clearly established that the very beginning of the Neolithic period witnessed an elaborate and complicated social organization. The subject of social stratification and settlement hierarchy in the Neolithic period has been dealt with in a number of works (Kuijt 1994; Bar- Yosef and Bar-Yosef-Mayer 2002; Garfinkel and Dag 2008). What can Sha'ar Hagolan contribute to this question? In 1998, Michele Miller carried out a surface survey in the fields of Kibbutz Sha'ar Hagolan that established the area of the ancient settlement at ca. 20 hectares, making it one of the largest sites of its period (for detailed discussion of survey and survey methods, see Miller 2002). Its size was determined by three factors: 1 The location of the eight excavation areas, four excavated by Stekelis and four by our expedition (at that time Area N had not yet been opened). These areas extend over ca. 1 km. on the north-south axis x 300 m. on the east-west axis. 2 In some of the test trenches dug in the western and northern parts of the site, remains of walls and floors were observed, and artifacts were present in the soil removed from them. Trenches located further to the north contained no finds. 3 The surface survey established that artifacts were scattered over the entire surface of the site. Estimating the size of the population at Sha'ar Hagolan, like any other paleo-demographic reconstruction, is a problematic task. The two main determining factors are: 1 The specific area of the site that was occupied simultaneously; in other words, were the entire 20 hectares occupied at any given time, or only part of the site? This problem is relevant to every site, even small-scale settlements of approximately one hectare. 2 Population density: how many people lived on one hectare (see, for example, Broshi and Gophna 1984: 41^2). As neither of these factors can be determined in the case of Sha' ar Hagolan, only a general estimate of the total population can be achieved. A simulation of various possibilities is presented in Table 6.1. Four alternative site sizes were considered: the entire area (20 hectares), three quarters (15 hectares), half (10 hectares) and one quarter (5 hectares). Three population density coefficients were proposed: 200, 150 and 100 per hectare. These are relatively modest estimates. Kenyon (1957: 65) suggested that the population of Neolithic Jericho, with an estimated area of 8 acres (3.2 hectares) was ca. 3000 (i.e., ca. 900 persons per hectare). More realistic estimates for early urban civilizations have suggested population densities per hectare of 200 (Marfoe 1980: 320), 250 (Broshi and Gophna 1984: 41-42) and 300 (Renfrew 1972: 251). As can be seen in Table 6.1, the population estimates for Sha'ar Hagolan range between 500 and 4000. The site probably began as a rather small settlement that expanded over time through natural growth as well as the influx of new inhabitants. Since according to radiocarbon dating (Garfinkel 1999b) the entire Yarmukian culture lasted some 600 years, it Table 6.1 . Various estimates of Sha'ar Hagolan's population. Occupied area Density Population (in hectares) (per hectare) size 20 200 4,000 20 150 3,000 20 100 2,000 15 200 3,000 15 150 2,250 '5 100 1,500 ^0 200 2,000 JL0 150 1,500 10 100 1,000 5 J200 1,000 5 150 750 5 1 100 500 is quite possible that, at some time during that span of time, Sha'ar Hagolan attained a population of 3000 or even 4000. Concentrations of thousands of people were not common at such an early period, and thus the inhabitants of Sha'ar Hagolan had to deal with a way of life that was new in the human experience. In order to evaluate the size of the Sha'ar Hagolan community within a regional-level context, we will survey all the known sites of the Pottery Neolithic Yarmukian culture (see Fig. 1.1). Unfortunately, most of the excavation reports for these sites are rather schematic accounts, lacking data on such crucial aspects as site size, architecture and material culture. Nevertheless, the following brief descriptions can be put forth (with estimations of size often based only on general impressions): 1 Byblos (Lebanese coast). In the excavations at Byblos, three Neolithic stages were defined by Dunand (1973): "néolithique ancien," "néolithique moyen" and "néolithique récent". The "néolithique ancien" is a mixture of PPNB architecture and flint together with typical Yarmukian pottery, flint, clay and pebble figurines and various incised items (Garfinkel 2004b). A general estimation of the size of the site could reach hectares. 2 Horvat 'Uza (coastal plain). During salvage excavations conducted by Getzov, a few typical Yarmukian sherds were discovered at the bottom of a small test pit in Stratum 20 (Getzov 1995). No data are available on the size of the Yarmukian settlement at the site, its architecture or material culture. 3 Tel Qishion (Lower Galilee). Classical Yarmukian pottery and one figurine were collected on the surface of this site (Arnon and Amiran 1981: PI. 37). 4 Munhata (central Jordan Valley) . A Yarmukian settlement (Stratum 2b) was exposed over some 2050 sq. m. by Perrot (1964, 1966a, 1968). It lay above a Pre-Pottery Neolithic settlement (Strata 6-3) and below a Wadi Rabah occupation (Stratum 2a). Rich assemblages of pottery, figurines, flint and stone tools were published (Gopher 1989; Garfinkel 1992, 1995; Gopher and Orrelle 1995). No final report on the stratigraphy or architecture has been published, but only 69</page><page sequence="90">CHAPTER 6 a schematic plan of the Yarmukian settlement including some 50 pits and five rounded structures (Garfinkel 1992: Figs. 3-7). It appears that the entire site covers no more than 2 hectares. 5 4 Ain Rahub (Jordanian Plateau). Limited excavations were carried out at this site and a small collection of sherds was published in detail (Kafafi 1989). 6 Hazorea (Jezreel Valley). A few pottery sherds with the typical incised herringbone decoration were reported (Anati 197 1 ; Anati et al. 1973: Pl. XVIII:4a-b). The pottery assemblage of the so-called "Hazorea Culture" (Anati et al. 1973: Fig. 58), although published separately from the decorated sherds, is typically Yarmukian in form. These finds clearly indicate that a Yarmukian settlement existed here; however, nothing is known of its size or nature. 7 Nahal Zehora II (Carmel Hills). A preliminary publication mentioned a Yarmukian presence at the site (Gopher 1993). 8 Megiddo (Jezreel Valley). A Yarmukian settlement was discovered at the base of Tel Megiddo in Area BB , although it was not recognized as such (Loud 1948). The remains included rounded structures together with typical pottery and flint and a clay figurine (Garfinkel 1993a: 128-129, Fig. 2). As the Yarmukian settlement is buried at the bottom of a tell, its size is unknown, but could not have been larger than the tell itself, ca. 6 hectares. 9 Hamadiya (central Jordan Valley). One excavation season was carried out by Kaplan at this single-stratum site; the report mentions pits, ovens and fireplaces, but no building remains, while typical pottery, flint and art objects are briefly mentioned (Kaplan 1993). No detailed report has been published. 10 Pella (central Jordan Valley). A number of typical Yarmukian pottery sherds (without incised herringbone decoration) and stone artifacts, designated as "late Neolithic," were reported from this site (McNicoll et al. 1982: 17-34, Pl. 103; Hanbury-Tenison et al. 1992: Pl. 12; Bourke 1997: 97-98). As this phase is buried below a thick layer of later debris, nothing is known of the size or nature of the Yarmukian settlement. 11 Tell el-Far 'ah North (Samarían Hills). At the base of the site, a fragment of a characteristic Yarmukian jar, along with typical denticulated sickle blades, was reported (de Vaux and Steve 1947: Fig. 1:34), testifying to Yarmukian activity at the site. However, as this phase is buried below a thick layer of later debris, nothing is known of the size or nature of the Yarmukian settlement. 12 Abu Thawwab (Jordanian Plateau). A Yarmukian settlement at the site extended over an area of 200 x 300 m. (6 hectares), of which an area of ca. 400 sq. m. has been exposed. A final excavation report has been published, with chapters on architecture, flint, pottery, figurines, faunai and botanical remains (Kafafi 2001). 13 Nahal Qanah Cave (Samarían Hills). Yarmukian pottery and flint lacking stratigraphie context were collected in this karstie cave (Gopher and Tsuk 1996). 14 Habashan Street (coastal plain). Three seasons of excavations were conducted at this site, located in the center of Tel Aviv, between 1950 and 1952. Some 500 sq. m. of the Yarmukian layer were exposed, containing 20 pits, a primary burial, pottery, flint and figurines (Kaplan 1954; Kaplan and Ritter-Kaplan 1993). 15 4 Ain Ghazal (Jordanian Plateau). The excavations at this site, excavated by Rollefson, exposed a settlement sequence comprising three successive phases: PPNB, PPNC and Yarmukian. The Yarmukian level includes rectilinear architecture as well as the characteristic material culture: pottery, flint, figurines and incised pebbles (Kafafi 1990, 1993; Rollefson 1993, 2000). The size estimation of the site is between 2-3 hectares. 1 6 Wadi Shu'eib (Jordanian Plateau) . Small-scale excavations conducted at this site produced Yarmukian pottery, although no clear data have been presented (Kafafi 1993; Simmons et al. 2001). 17 Wadi Murabba'at Cave (Judean Desert). A few pottery sherds with typical Yarmukian shapes and decorations were discovered in a cave in Wadi Murabba'at (Benoit et al. 1961), lacking stratigraphie context and mixed with later Ghassulian Chalcolithic pottery. From the data summarized in Table 6.2, it is clear that Sha'ar Hagolan is preeminent in every aspect: site size, magnitude and sophistication of architecture, site planning and richness of art repertoire. It may be surmised that Sha'ar Hagolan was the economic, social and religious center for the entire Yarmukian culture, which was probably organized as a large tribe. COURTYARD STRUCTURES AND THE EXTENDED FAMILY Three complete courtyard structures were uncovered at Sha'ar Hagolan, two in Area E and one in Area H. (Figs. 6.1-6.2, 6.15). BUILDING COMPLEX I IN AREA E This complex, located in the eastern part of Area E (Figs. 6.1- 6.2), consists of a large, open triangular courtyard surrounded by eight rooms. The measurements of Building Complex I are approximately 17.3 x 15.8 m., with a total area of 233 sq. m. The net inner floor area, without walls, is 152.5 sq. m. The only entrance to the building is located on the southern side of the courtyard, where a paved threshold was found. The building has the shape of an asymmetrical pentagon with two right angles and a narrow southern side. The eight rooms enclosing the courtyard are designated on the plan (Fig. 6.2) by the letters B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I, and the courtyard by the letter A. The room in the southwest corner is round, while all the other rooms are rectangular or square. Five of the rooms have a beaten-earth floor and three (D, G and I) are paved with flat, close-fitting basalt pebbles. No clearly defined entrance was found in any of the stone-paved rooms, and thus they were probably entered through a window-like opening that was higher than the currently preserved height of the walls. Since these rooms are distinguished by their paved floors and lack of an entrance at floor level, their function was probably different from that of the other rooms. They would have been well insulated against insects, rodents and damp, providing good conditions for storage, and thus should be regarded as storerooms. 70</page><page sequence="91">DISCUSSION: THE RISE OF URBAN CONCEPTS IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST Table 6.2.

A fourth unit in the northeast corner (E) does not have an associated storeroom, but half of the room is taken up by two stone-paved installations that may have been granaries (see the accessibility diagram in Fig. 6.3). In view of the large size and modular arrangement of Building Complex I, it could have been occupied by four nuclear families, probably an extended family (Flannery 2002; Garfinkel 2002a). Social organization at the site of Sha'ar Hagolan will be discussed below. BUILDING COMPLEX II IN AREA E This building is located in the western part of Area E (Figs. 6.1, 6.4). Its maximum dimensions are approximately 35 x 20 m., with a total area of 710 sq. m. and a net floor area, without the walls, of 510 sq. m. Although the ground plan of Complex II is different from that of Complex I, the architectural concept is clearly that of a courtyard building. There are 24 rooms of various sizes around the courtyard, some of them paved. Building Complex II is separated from the street that borders it on the east by a north-south wall, in which the building's entrance was apparently located. Along the inner Fig. 6.1 .

Area E, schematic plan of Building Complex II. side of this wall is a series of small rooms, similar in size to the small rooms on the eastern side of Complex I. Room G, paved with close-fitting basalt pebbles, was probably a storeroom. The southern end of Building Complex II is currently within the flooding zone of the Yarmuk River; part of it has been carried off by floods in the past and the entire southeast corner is missing. From the surviving remains, we can reconstruct a row of small rooms, one of which (K) was paved with basalt slabs. On the north, the building is enclosed by the straight back wall of the large main room (Q) and the corner room (R). In Room Q, several figurines were recovered, including a complete clay figurine decorated with herringbone pattern and another carved on a stone pebble. In the corner of this room is a curved wall that creates a separate room (P). The northern part of Room R yielded an unusually large number of finds, including about twenty stone vessels and utensils (bowls, a grinding stone, a pestle and hammerstones), a cooking pot, ' and a large granary jar that was set into the floor of the room. Since Room R was clearly connected with food preparation, we called it "the kitchen" during excavation. Unlike the other three sides, the western side of Building Complex II is not enclosed by a straight wall, but the building's edge is formed by a group of seven rooms alongside the courtyard. There is a similar layout in Building Complex I, which is enclosed by a well-defined line on the east, south and west, but bordered on the north by a combination of three unaligned spaces. In the open central courtyard of Building Complex II were several installations (pits, stone paving, mud-plaster paving and four large mortars). The rooms were apparently arranged in seven clusters (C-F, E-G-H-I, O-P-Q-R, S-T-U-V, N-M, L-K, X-Y). This complex was thus occupied by a large extended family, possibly eight nuclear families living together (Fig. 6.5). Building Complex II is without a doubt the largest structure from such an early period that has been uncovered in the Middle East. It was clearly a courtyard house with rows of rooms on all four sides. About 70 figurines made of fired clay or carved on limestone pebbles (some complete and many fragmentary) were found in the building, the largest collection of art objects ever discovered in a single prehistoric structure. The occurrence of so many art objects in this building is an intriguing phenomenon. Was it simply a dwelling, or did other public or religious activities take place here? Fig. 6.5.

An area of 700 sq. m. was excavated, with the remains of at least five large courtyard buildings abutting one another on either side of a plastered street. Excavation of the eastern part of Area H was limited by a dirt road that runs on what was the embankment of a fish pond. Nevertheless, we excavated as far as possible to the east, removing a few meters of the embankment until we could reconstruct the complete plan of one building (Fig. 6.6). The basic architectural concept of the buildings in Area H is Fig. 6.6. Area H, schematic plan of Building Complex I. Fig. 6.7. Area H, accessibility diagram of Building Complex I. similar to that of the two buildings unearthed in Area E. Building Complex I is composed of a large, open central courtyard (A) surrounded by ten rooms. On the west is a row of four small rooms (B-C-D-E). In the corner of Room D, a large granary jar was sunk into the floor. On the southern side of the building is the largest room (F). To the east, two additional rooms (H-I) border the courtyard, and two rooms (J-K) were revealed in the northeast corner of the building. Room K is partly stone-paved and a basalt mortar was found on its floor. Four of the rooms have floors that are either paved of stone (E, G, K) or coated with an exceptionally thick layer of plaster (C). Since these rooms do not open directly onto the courtyard, they were apparently storage rooms. They are located adjacent to rooms with a beaten-earth surface and together create four pairs (B-C, D-E, F-G, J-K). Rooms H and I open directly onto the courtyard and do not have an adjoining storage facility (Fig. 6.7). Following publication of Sha ' ar Hagolan I, one reviewer questioned whether "individual structures within a courtyard system were built and used at the same time, or if the courtyard system is the result of multiple structures that were used at different stages" (Kuijt 2004: 70). After unearthing three complete courtyard structures at Sha'ar Hagolan, it is clear that the site exhibits an architectural pattern with a standard type of dwelling. No superimposition of walls or rooms was discerned, indicating that the rooms around the courtyard were built together, the walls abut each other and the courtyard floors extend to the various rooms, indicating that functionally and stratigraphically the various parts of the courtyard buildings comprised a single unit. A further indication of the contemporaneity of the various rooms surrounding the courtyards is the organization along straight lines on both sides of plastered streets and alleyways. This reflects a new approach to dwelling and site organization, a further stage in the general development of Neolithic architecture. NEOLITHIC ARCHITECTURE IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST Neolithic architecture in the ancient Near East was systematically surveyed by O. Aurenche (1981a), although since then new data have accumulated. Other works in the years since have focused on more specific periods or regions within the Neolithic era (Aurenche 1981b; Redman 1983; Kubba 1987; Banning and Byrd 1987, 1988; Breniquet 1991; Bar-Yosef 1992a, 1992b). In Sha'ar Hagolan 7, we presented a detailed survey of the evolution of dwelling structures in the Near East, from the beginning of architecture to the Pottery Neolithic period (Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo 2002b). Neolithic structures were classified into four main types, from simple or nuclear houses to the more sophisticated ones: round houses, simple rectangular houses, multipartite complex houses and courtyard houses, with further subdivisions in each category. The scheme is morphological, considering both the general shape of the houses and the internal architectural plan. We will not repeat here the entire presentation, but an abstract and the illustrations.

In the Natufian and PPNA periods, this was the only type of dwelling constructed (Fig. 6.9). Round houses are easier to build than rectangular ones, as they are constructed from a single wall and require less material to confine a given area. According to ethnographic observations, round houses characterize simple farming communities (Flannery 1972; Breniquet 1996: Pis. 47-53). Two basic types of rounded houses can be defined: the simple round house (Fig. 6.9:1-6) and the round house with internal division (Fig. 6.9:7-9). At PPNA Jericho some houses were constructed from two adjoining rounded rooms, a relatively rare type of construction that did not have a wide distribution (Kenyon 1981: Pis. 277, 278a). RECTANGULAR HOUSES Reòtilinear architecture was introduced some 3000 yèars later and represents the next step in architectural evolution. Flannery suggests that rectangular houses are more typical of sedentary societies with agricultural subsistence and mark the transition from band camps to villages (1972: 30). Rectangular houses are more easily arranged in a settlement and it is easier to add new units to the house or to subdivide it. Three different subtypes are classified under this category. The first subtype comprises 74 •Çayônû ^ ^ •ÇatalHúyúk {=?

Bouqras (Akkermans et al. 1983: Fig. 5); 3^L Tell es-Sawwan (Breniquet 1991: Fig. 6). from the PPNB period onwards, which are constructed as a network of rather small rectangular or square rooms. MULTIPARTITE COMPLEX HOUSES Complex rectangular houses differ from simple rectangular houses in having several defined sectors, each further divided into smaller units (Aurenche 1981a: 47, "le plan complexe"). This clearly demonstrates complex inner architectural planning. The two main subtypes appearing elsewhere in the ancient Near East are the rectangular bi- or tripartite house (Fig. 6.12:1-2) and the T-shaped tripartite house (Fig. 6.12:3^-). No examples of this type have yet been found in the southern Levant. COURTYARD HOUSES The courtyard house differs from the above types in having a dominant central unit, the open courtyard, surrounded by smaller rooms (Fig. 6.13). The courtyard occupies a large portion of the structure, usually 40-50% of the net usable area of the building. The rooms are arranged around the courtyard and their entrances open onto it, as does the main entrance of the house. The earliest substantiated appearance of this type of house is at Sha'ar Hagolan. The main entrance of Building Complex I in Area E leads directly into the courtyard. The courtyard comprises ca. 40% of the gross area of the building and 60% of the net usable area, and contains various installations and pits. A somewhat different courtyard structure is the "painted house" at Zaghe, Iran, contemporary with the PPNC (Fig. 6.13:2; Negabhan 1979: 240-244, Fig. 2).

In Level II at Hassuna, contemporary with the Pottery Neolithic, remnants of rooms and open areas may have been courtyard houses, although preservation here is poor (Lloyd and Safar 1945: Fig. 45; for reconstructions see Breniquet 1991: Fig. 9; Flannery 2002). Later on, in the sixth millennium BCE, small houses with attached courtyards do seem to appear. Other possible examples can be seen at Umm Dabaghiyah and Sabi Abyad (Kirkbride 1975: Pl. II; Verhoeven and Kranendonk 1996: Fig. 2.17). The development of courtyard houses can be seen as reflecting a logical evolutionary step in the development of human social complexity. Although such processes cannot always be detected in the archaeological record (see Goring- Morris and Belfer-Cohen and 2003: 76-77 for the Natufian period), they are more significant for our understanding of human social evolution than phenomena explained as cultic or irrational expressions of human behavior. Thus, the search for rational and evolutional explanations of architectural developments in the prehistoric and protohistoric periods should not be relinquished. In summary, this short survey of major house types in the early proto-historic Near East clearly demonstrates an ongoing exploration of alternative architectural solutions. Among traditional agrarian communities in the Near East, the basic architectural concept of the courtyard house remains in use to this day. For example, the modern village of Hassanabad in northwestern Iran is built of several courtyard houses. The courtyards are used for various outdoor activities and for short-term storage of crops. At the edge of the village is the "Qal'a"- the landlord's house (Fig. 6.13:3). This building is larger, especially its courtyard, in which the landlord's share of the crop is deposited at harvest time (Watson 1979: 34, 40, 294, Fig. 5.29). What are the characteristics of the courtyard structure that have made it the preferred plan to the present day? It provides optimal solutions to the basic needs of the household and the activities that took place within it. These can be classified into indoor activities in the rooms and roofed spaces, including shelter, sleeping, and storage of food and goods, and outdoor activities in the open courtyard such as cooking and eating, protection for domestic animals, and working (flint knapping, weaving, basketry, etc). In the other types of buildings mentioned above, the outdoor activities were probably carried out near the house, in the open areas between the buildings, which provided little privacy. When the courtyard house was introduced, these outdoor activities were moved to the internal courtyard, isolated from the rest of the village. SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AT SHA6 AR HAGOLAN The architecture at Neolithic Sha'ar Hagolan exhibits a tripartite division of space, suggesting a three-tiered social organization in the community (Fig. 6.14): 1. THE INDIVIDUAL HOUSEHOLD (THE NUCLEAR FAMILY) As demonstrated by the analysis of Building Complex I (above pp. 70-71), each nuclear family had a dwelling room and an adjacent storage facility, consisting of either an enclosed paved room or large granary jars below the floor inside the small room. The domestic space of the nuclear family thus was quite limited (10-15 sq. m.). One might question whether this would have been adequate; however, other Pottery Neolithic structures, including those at Munhata (Garfinkel 1992: Figs. 3,7), Jericho (Kenyon 1981: Fig. 228), Lod (Blockman 1997: 6) and Abu Thawwab (Kafafi 2001: PL 7a), contain small rounded structures of similar size, usually 2-3 m. in diameter and not exceeding 15-20 sq. m. in area. 2. THE BUILDING COMPLEX (THE EXTENDED FAMILY) Besides the significance for the history of architecture of the courtyard structures of Sha'ar Hagolan, they are of unique importance for our understanding of the social organization of the site's community. They raise such basic questions as who lived in these relatively large buildings and what were the functions of the various rooms.

Within this complex, basic units of two rooms are discerned, one room with a beaten-earth floor and a doorway, and the adjacent room without an entrance, but with carefully laid stone paving. Three such units surrounded the courtyard (C-D, F-G and H-I). This plan suggests that four nuclear families lived together in this complex, inferring close kinship, probably that of an extended family. In fact, one can see each courtyard building at Sha'ar Hagolan as an independent dwelling quarter for an extended family.* Building Complex II in Area E, although differing in ground plan from Building Complex I, is clearly a courtyard building. It consists of 24 rooms organized as units, at least seven of which can be distinguished (C-F, E-G-H-I, Q-P-O-R, S-T-U-V, W-Y-X, N-M and L-K). This complex was thus occupied by a large extended family, consisting of at least seven nuclear families. Building Complex I in Area H has ten rooms arranged around a large open courtyard. Some of the rooms (E, G, K) have floors paved with flat river pebbles, and one room (C) has a floor of hard, compacted mud plaster. The pattern of a storage room adjacent to a living area recurs here: four such units are clustered (B-C, D-E, F-G, J-K). Rooms H and I are different, each having an entrance, a regular beaten-earth floor, and no attached storage facility. In each courtyard house there is one larger broadroom unit facing the main entrance (Rooms C-D in Building Complex I and Rooms R-Q in Building Complex II of Area E; Rooms F-G in Building Complex I of Area H). As this broadroom is both larger than the other units and located in a strategic position, it may have been the dwelling unit of the head of the extended family. In Neolithic villages the open areas between the houses were generally used for cooking, storage in pits and various other household activities ("open settlement", Fig. 6. 14 A). At Sha'ar Hagolan, however, the open area was integrated within the building as an enclosed courtyard ("condensed closed settlement", Fig. 6.14B). This placed the open area under tight control, limiting access to approved persons. To this day, personal belongings, wealth and women are protected in the enclosed courtyard in some parts of the Middle East. Most It should be noted that both Flannery (2002) and one of the present authors (Garfinkel 2002b) suggested simultaneously and independently that evidence for extended families living together can be traced in the architecture of the Near East. Ironically, an anonymous reviewer for a grant proposal submitted to the Israel Science Foundation in 2001 wrote: "Others (e.g. Flannery), however, would argue that the smaller rooms were occupied by individuals." Yet Flannery himself, after attending a lecture by Garfinkel on the Sha'ar Hagolan architecture and its social significance, delivered at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, on September 12th, 2002, wrote: "To whoever it was that told you that Kent would call Building I a residence for an 'individual', you have our permission to tell him he is wrong! You have wonderful data for extended families" (letter dated October 25th, 2002). of the finds (pottery, flint, animal bones, stone vessels and figurines) were made in the courtyard. Conjoinable flint items from the courtyard of Building Complex I indicate that flint knapping took place here (Matskevich 2002). Pits, installations and large basalt implements such as mortars and grinding slabs were the common property of the extended family. Families that produced more than they consumed may have begun to accumulate wealth in the form of larger fields or flocks. Such households might be distinguishable in the material culture by the larger size of their dwellings, as well as the presence of remarkable items such as obsidian, seashells, beads and exotic stone vessels. Even regular commodities in such houses would be larger and more elaborate in shape and decoration. Indeed, a comparison of Building Complexes I and II in Area E reveals such differences (size of structure, percentage of decorated pottery, figurines), suggesting a hierarchy based on wealth or social status. 3. THE VILLAGE (THE COMMUNITY) The third level is the community, or the entire village. Large Neolithic structures, which may be the dwellings of extended families, have been found at a number of sites dated to the later part of the Neolithic period (late Pre-Pottery Neolithic or Pottery Neolithic): Bouqras, Basta, Tell es-Sawwan, Zaghe and Hassuna (Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo 2002b; Flannery 2002). Flannery has attributed these developments to an increasing economic complexity: "...married sons remain attached to the household of their father because the combination of two tasks - cereal agriculture and the grazing of herd animals - requires a division of labor beyond the capacity of a nuclear family. By 5500 B.C. many Near Eastern villages not only grew wheat, barley, lentils, and peas for food, but also raised flax for linen and had added cattle and pig to the herding of sheep and goats. A family of 15-20 simply had more manpower to perform all the disparate tasks in such an economy, which could include some kind of craft production as well" (Flannery 2002: 424). Like Flannery, we view these large structures as the dwellings of extended families, but we offer a different reason for their development. In the context of the Pottery Neolithic period of the southern Levant, only the site of Sha'ar Hagolan presents such architecture, although a mixed economy was practiced at all other PN sites. Indeed, many of them, such as Munhata, Hamadiya, Habashan Street, Abu Thawwab, Lod, Teluliyot Batash, Jericho and Ghrubba (see Fig. 6.8), present only pits or small rounded huts of the type characterizing the very early stages of the Natufian and early Pre-Pottery Neolithic A. Thus, there is no direct link between the economy of a settlement and its physical and social structure. The critical issue in this case is the development at Sha'ar Hagolan of a unique mega-settlement in the Pottery Neolithic period. How did this community adapt to the new demographic situation of an aggregation of several thousand people? Ethnographic observations of humans under population pressure indicate that various aspects of their behavior can change in such situations: "scalar stress refers to the stresses inherent in large population aggregations, which must be reduced through strategies as diverse as increasingly hierarchical social organization, group fission, and increasing 77</page><page sequence="98">CHAPTER 6 incidence of group ritual" (Carneiro 1967; see also Johnson 1982; Friesen 1999). In addition, construction of large modular complexes for the use of extended families as a direct response to population pressure has been observed among the Inuit tribes of North America during their aggregation period (Friesen 1999). This ethnographic example indicates how similar behavioral patterns are reflected in similar material culture. Thus, one of the possible results of a number of nuclear families dwelling together is the development of large structures that exhibit a modular pattern in their internal plan. The concentration of thousands of people in one settlement would have affected human relationships due to the loss of the unity, intimacy and freedom that are typical of small groups. In a large society, well-defined and strict behavioral laws must be adopted to regulate and organize the individuals into a cohesive social unit. One of the strategies that develop, as we learn from ethnographic observation of contemporary traditional societies (see, e.g., Johnson 1982), is to unite several nuclear families into one extended family. Thus, in our opinion, the large courtyard buildings at Sha'ar Hagolan reflect a new behavioral pattern in the ancient Near East, apparently appearing for the first time as an adaptation to population pressure. Unlike most earlier Neolithic villages, in which society was organized on two levels - the nuclear family (parents and children) and the community- a new three-tiered organization emerged- the nuclear family, the extended family and the community. At the Community Level: Settlement Planning and Layout (Fig. 6.15) Settlement planning is a clear indication of a centralized authority and is usually characteristic of state-level social organization. The existence of a city wall, gates and a network of streets is the basic infrastructure of the traditional city. However, one may raise the question of whether the appearance of one or more of these three elements is sufficient to indicate the existence of organized planning, or could such elements have developed spontaneously over time? Two alternative approaches have proposed concerning the Early Bronze Age Canaanite city of Arad. In the opinion of the excavators, the network of streets suggested a certain level of planning: "The radial system must have been planned, while the concentric system probably developed expediently with the gradual growth of the city" (Amiran and Ilan 1996: 141). On the other hand, Banning, referring to Arad as well as to other case studies, claimed that: "The alternative exists, however, that the patterns evident in many of these sites have nothing to do with elites' global control over local decisions concerning construction and spatial organization. Processes by which global order arises out of local interactions-emergent order-may just as easily account for the patterns" (Banning 1996). Therefore, according to this view, there is no need for formalized city architects or bureaucrats paid by public taxes to achieve settlement planning. The circular camps of nomads and the PPNA settlements testify to some degree of pre-planning even at the very simplest of sites, which was a result not of central authority, but rather of communal self- discipline. Pre-planning of a settlement is not always a clear-cut issue. We will concentrate here on the evidence of pre-planning at Sha'ar Hagolan, with comparisons to the various settlement types found in the region. The key element in answering the question whether the Sha'ar Hagolan settlement was pre-planned in some way is undoubtedly the street network. The large horizontal exposure in Areas E and H revealed a significant portion of the ancient settlement. Buildings were constructed on either side of elongated corridors creating formalized passageways; those measuring ca. 2-3 m. are termed streets, while those ca. 1 m. or less are alleyways. The street system in Area E: In this area a street and an alley were unearthed (Figs. 6.1, 6.15). The street is a straight passage, 3 m. wide, separating Building Complexes I and II, which lie parallel on either side of the street. The surface of the street, exposed for a length of at least 40 m., was systematically cleared. It was composed of numerous superimposed layers of small, rounded flint river pebbles laid in a packed-mud matrix, up to a depth of some 0.30 m., indicating that the street had been resurfaced from time to time. These layers of re-surfacing belong to the final use of the street. An earlier street uncovered some 0.50 m. below the upper surface was narrower, as Buildings I and II were closer to each other in the earlier phase. Fig. 6.15. Schematic plan of the street layout at Sha'ar Hagolan. 78</page><page sequence="99">DISCUSSION: THE RISE OF URBAN CONCEPTS IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST The alley is a narrow, curving passageway, about 1 m. wide and so far exposed over a length of 15 m., which separates Building Complexes I and III on the southeastern border of Area E. The surface of the alley is of beaten earth with very few pebbles. The two passageways meet in a rectangular open area ("piazza"), situated in the south between Building Complexes I, II and III. It is characterized by whitish sediment with very few finds. Most of this open area, as well as the southern fringes of Building Complex II, has been eroded away by the Yarmuk River. The street and the alley lead from the settlement towards the water source, the Yarmuk River. They run roughly at right angles to the river, from north to south and northeast to southwest. As each family would have needed a daily supply of water for drinking and food preparation, one can imagine the Yarmukian women walking down the streets with jars on their heads to draw water from the river. In winter, the street system could have drained the water downward toward the river by the shortest route. The street in Area H: Another street, about 2 m. wide and running east- west, was exposed in the northern part of Area H, beyond the enclosing wall of Building Complex I. Several layers of plaster reach a total accumulation of nearly 0.5 m. A long, narrow, partially plastered depression runs for some 7 m. along the southwestern side of the street, continuing into the unexcavated area, and may have functioned as a rainwater drainage channel. While the two passageways in Area E are oriented north- south, from the settlement to the Yarmuk River, the street in Area H runs perpendicular to them, from east to west, indicating a grid-like pattern of streets at the site. This arrangement apparently divided the site into large insula- like segments. It is worth noting that some of the outer walls of the buildings built along the street extend beyond the buildings themselves, suggesting that the streets were laid out first, with walls on either side creating large enclosures surrounded by walls on all sides. These large spaces, which were further divided into building complexes, are interpreted as insulae. This would explain why the sides of the buildings facing the street are straight, while the other sides are not (e.g., the north side of Building Complex I and the west side of Building Complex II in Area E, and the south side of Building Complex I in Area H). The combination of the two north-south passageways in Area E and that in Area H, some 300 m. inside the settlement, with an east- west orientation, clearly indicates that the entire settlement had a planned network of passageways, extending northward from the riverbank for several hundred meters. This is the earliest evidence for such a network in Israel, and one of the earliest in the world. The streets in Areas E and H were paved with pebbles mixed with mud plaster and their surfaces were renewed from time to time, as evidenced by the numerous layers. While the maintenance of the individual houses was undoubtedly the responsibility of their residents, the plastering of large open public spaces and the maintenance of the streets must have required the cooperation of the entire community. Streets are known in the Neolithic period from only a few sites: A§ikli Höyük in Anatolia, dated to the PPNB (Esinetal. 1991);Ghwair in Jordan, dated to the PPNB (Najjar 2002); 'Ain Ghazal in Jordan, dated to the PPNC- a descending street composed of stairs, aligned perpendicular to the riverbed (Rollefson and Kafafi 1994: 13-14); and Tell Kurdu in the Amuq Valley, dated to the Pottery Neolithic/ Amuq C- a system of narrow streets, some perpendicular to others (Halafian; Özbal et al. 2004: 40^1, Figs. 2-5). The exposure of a village plan in an excavation is a much more complicated task than the recovery of the plan of a single house, as it requires excavation of the entire site or a significant portion of it, thereby requiring a long-term excavation project and a relatively small site. Very few sites have been treated in such a way and are thus relevant to our discussion. However, from the data at hand, it seems that six basic categories of settlements existed in the early proto-historic Near East: beehive pattern, rounded enclosures, scattered structures (probably the most common settlement type in the Neolithic period; Fig. 6.14A), arrangement around a central piazza, condensed network with access presumably through the roof, and construction along streets. 1 Beehive pattern. The earliest evidence for an entire settlement from the ancient Near East comes from the Natufian layer of Hayonim Cave (Fig. 6.16; Bar-Yosef 1991). Here, a concentration of five rounded structures abutted each other like the cells of a beehive. This simple arrangement appears later at PPNB sites in the arid zones of the Levant, such as Wadi Tbeik, Wadi Jibba and Nahal 'Issaron (Bar-Yosef 1982; Goring-Morris and Gopher 1983). 2 Rounded enclosures . B ased on ethnographic observations , some traditional societies that still use rounded architecture arrange the structures in a circle , creating an inner enclosure . This type of settlement organization has been suggested at the Natufian site of Mallaha, at Nahal Oren (Fig. 6.17; Stekelis and Yisraeli 1963) and at some Halafian sites Fig. 6.16. The Natufian "Beehive Complex at Hayonim Cave (Bar-Yosef 1991). 79</page><page sequence="100">CHAPTER 6 Fig. 6.17. The PPNA village of Nahal Oren (Stekelis and Yizraeli 1963). (Flannery 1972; Breniquet 1996: Pis. 47-53). Unlike the previous type, in this type of settlement each structure is freestanding, resulting in spaces between the buildings. 3 Scattered structures. In this category, the usually rectangular houses are scattered in no particular geometric configuration. Examples of these are known from Jerf el- Ahmar, Çayôníi and Hajji Firuz Tepe (Figs. 6.18-6.20; Redman 1983; Voigt 1983; Stordeur et al. 2001). 4 Arrangement around a central piazza. The structures of the village are arranged around a large open area. Clear examples have been uncovered at Boukras and Umm Dabaghiyah (Fig. 6.21; Kirkbride 1975; Akkermans et al. 1983). 5 Condensed network. In Anatolia, some of the sites were densely constructed with houses abutting one another without any passageway between them, and access is assumed to have been through the roof. The largest exposure is seen at Çatal Hüyük (Fig. 6.22), but the same pattern probably existed at Can Hasan III as well (Mellaart 1967; 1975: Fig. 44). In this planning concept, there are inner courtyards, which probably functioned as public gathering areas, between the buildings but not associated with any particular structure. 6 Construction along streets. These villages are densely constructed, with houses built along passageways. No open areas, apart from formalized streets and alleys, were left between the buildings. The earliest clear examples are from PPNB Agikli Höyük (Fig. 6.23, Esin et al. 1991: 141, Pl. 4) and Sha' ar Hagolan. It is interesting to note that during the 7th-6th millennia BCE in the ancient Near East, two different settlement models were in use contemporaneously in large communities (Fig. 6.24). Çatal Hüyük was closely built up, with houses abutting one another without any passageway between them. Access is believed to have been by ladder through the roof, which would have imposed a heavy burden on older people and pregnant women, and presented difficulties for animals and for the transportation of goods or building materials. Thus, it is no wonder that this model was a dead end in the evolution Fig. 6.18. The PPNA village ol Jen: el-Ahmar (Stordeur 1998: Fig. 3). Fig. 6.19. The PPNB village ol Çayonu (Redman 1983).

The problematic space organization of Çatal Hüyük was further defined by Cutting using the "space syntax technique", which analyzes the depth and connectivity within and between architectural units (Cutting 2003: 5-17). Cutting compared Çatal Hüyük to Hacilar and noted the lack of connectivity between the various buildings and open areas at Çatal Hüyük. Note that Hacilar more closely resembles Sha'ar Hagolan in the division of space and existence of large open courtyards. The other settlement model, as seen at Sha'ar Hagolan, Fig. 6.23. The PPNB village of A§ikli (Esin et al. 1991). was the construction of houses along narrow streets and alleyways. From the evolutionary point of view, construction along streets provided a better solution to daily life and was adapted as the main pattern for large (and small) urban settlements until today. The combination of courtyard buildings and streets at Sha'ar Hagolan was a major contribution to the rise of an urban infrastructure in the ancient Near East. As mentioned above, the presence of streets indicates site planning and a certain level of community discipline, and thus highlights several aspects of social organization in the Neolithic community at Sha'ar Hagolan: 1 In order to create the streets, the houses must be arranged in relation to one another, with parallel outer walls. 2 Passageways of two kinds were observed: wide, straight streets with pebbled surfaces and a narrow curved alley with a beaten-earth surface. 3 The orientation of the street and alley in Area E is more or less perpendicular to the river. Thus, these paths led from the inner settlement to the riverbank, enabling easy access to the water source of the population. As the river was lower than the settlement, the streets also provided a drainage system during heavy winter rains. 4 Unlike the houses, which were built and maintained by the individual families, the street was clearly a public space whose maintenance required an organized communal effort. This phenomenon raises several questions 81</page><page sequence="102">CHAPTER 6 Fig. 6.24.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES OF URBAN CENTERS AT SHA4 AR HAGOLAN INFRASTRUCTURE Settlement density At the advent of the agricultural revolution, settlements were typically open villages in which the houses, round or rectilinear, were scattered in no particular configuration. When a large horizontal exposure was excavated, as at the PPNA sites of Jerf el-Ahmar, Çayônii and Hajji Firuz Tepe (Redman 1983; Voigt 1983; Stordeur et al. 2001), it became clear that relatively large spaces were left between the individual houses . Next to the houses were open activity areas that contained hearths, grindstones and pits. In these villages there was no clear distinction between the areas close to the houses, which were used by the houses' occupants, and the public domain of the village, and all possible routes were used to move between the structures. At the PPNB site of Agikli (Fig. 6.23), and a millennium later at Çatal Hliyük (Fig. 6.22) and Sha' ar Hagolan, the built- up environment was characterized by condensed construction. At Sha'ar Hagolan the houses were built abutting each other. In Area E we uncovered two complete buildings, and segments of three others were exposed in the rest of the excavation area. In Area H, one complete building was found along with segments of four others. Why did families build their dwelling units in such close proximity, thus sacrificing privacy and the nearby open areas for activities such as storage or food processing? Furthermore, the density raised the possibility of conflicts with neighbors regarding aspects of daily life such as the maintenance of walls and streets, drainage of rainwater, dumping of garbage, etc. The settlement plan at Sha'ar Hagolan, characterized by enclosed, closely spaced buildings, is, however, different from other contemporary "condensed settlements" that do not have streets. The roofed rooms are arranged in rows around an open activity area, creating a courtyard that is enclosed within a residential building and completely separate from the village's public domain. The houses are closely spaced, leaving only narrow streets and alleys between them. This is a major step toward the planning of complex cities such as Canaanite Arad, which was founded some 3000 years later and contained courtyard houses and a network of streets. Water supply The discovery of the well at Sha'ar Hagolan was a surprise. Although Neolithic wells are known in areas without a permanent water supply, such as those in Cyprus and at ' Atlit Yam, Sha'ar Hagolan is located on the bank of one of the most abundant rivers in the southern Levant, and there is no shortage of water here. Thus, it would seem that the digging of the well was related more to the quality than to the quantity of the water supply. Indeed, in places where thousands of people and their livestock congregate, water can easily become polluted, presenting a major health hazard to a large community in particular. INTENSIFIED RITUAL AND EARLY BUREAUCRACY Intensified ritual and bureaucracy are characteristic of urban centers, as well as large Neolithic settlements of the period. At Sha'ar Hagolan, the richest assemblage of prehistoric art ever found in Israel was uncovered. The large settlements of 'Ain Ghazal in Jordan and Çatal Hüyük in Anatolia, dated to ca. 7500 and 6500 BCE (cal.) respectively, also yielded large quantities of art and cult objects. There appears to be some correlation between the size of the population and the number of art objects, and an increase in size and density of the settlement results in a corresponding increase in religious and cultic activity. Ceremonial activities unite the community and divert resources to different sub-groups within the society. Another incipient urban characteristic evident at Sha'ar Hagolan is early bureaucracy. As we are only just beginning to study this phenomenon, we will not elaborate upon it here. Although writing does not appear for several thousand years, we do have evidence of seals (Beck 1993; Garfinkel 1999a: 90) and about ten small clay items bearing traces of sealings (M. Freikman, personal communication). At Tell Sabi Aby ad Level VI in Syria, roughly contemporary to Sha'ar Hagolan, hundreds of clay sealings and a small number of stamp seals were recovered (Duistermaat 1996; Akkermans and Duistermaat 2004). Perhaps there are similar quantities in other parts of Sha'ar Hagolan, where public activities took place. In addition, basalt river pebbles found at Sha'ar Hagolan bear geometric patterns that are also known on early seals in the region (Stekelis 1972; Garfinkel 2004a: 197-201), and have been found throughout the ancient Near East. These geometric patterns are probably indications for the beginning of personal or family identity symbols (Eirikh-Rose 2004). SHA4 AR HAGOLAN'S CONTRIBUTION TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH The courtyard buildings of Sha'ar Hagolan are without doubt the most important contribution of the site to the archaeology of the ancient Near East. As they are far too large for the basic needs of a nuclear family, they are indicative of a more complex social organization, probably of extended families. Pairs, or clusters, of rooms within the courtyard complex seem to have accommodated one nuclear family, while the entire building or insula , combining several buildings, represents an extended family or a clan. In conclusion, four points should be emphasized concerning the new discoveries at Sha'ar Hagolan: 1 The appearance of large-scale architecture in the Pottery Neolithic period is unique, as very few architectural remains have been discovered from this period anywhere in the region in previous excavations. 2 A new type of architectural plan, the courtyard house, appears in the Neolithic of the Near East. Courtyard houses are still used today by traditional societies in the Near East and the Mediterranean basin. Their appearance for the first time at Sha'ar Hagolan lends the site a unique position in the history of architecture. 3 The large sizes of the houses at Sha'ar Hagolan suggest they were inhabited by extended families. 4 An urban concept is indicated by the formalized 83</page><page sequence="104">CHAPTER 6 passageways, both wide and narrow, that required periodic maintenance. Such a combination of streets and courtyard houses can be found in cities of the ancient Near East, such as Early Bronze Age Arad. In this settlement plan, a condensed network of buildings was created with maximum exploitation of the available settlement area. This type of human organization can now be traced as far back as the Pottery Neolithic period of the 6th millennium BCE or even earlier. While research at Sha'ar Hagolan has concentrated mainly on the courtyard structures, uncovering evidence of daily life on the level of the nuclear family and the extended family, future work could contribute to our understanding of higher levels of organization at the site: the insula , reflecting the clan, and the community as a whole. We would like to end this discussion with a number of suggestions for further research at Sha'ar Hagolan: 1 A survey of the entire site by ground-penetrating radar, or another physical method, in order to obtain a complete site plan and clarify the layout of the street network, insulae, open areas, wells, and perhaps public buildings. 2 We know that the street network divided the settlement into insulae. How were these insulae organized? Were there open areas at the back of the houses? Did each insula have a well? 3 Since no evidence of systematic burial was discerned inside the courtyard buildings, there must have been some communal burial arrangement. Were there special burial structures at the site or a cemetery outside of it? 4 The location of areas for specialized economic activities, such as workshops for the production of pottery, figurines, stone and flint tools, which would reveal the mode of production and the level of specialization in the ancient community. 5 Public ritual is an aspect of which we know very little. Was there a specialized central gathering place at the site? Was it a center of pilgrimage for populations living in other Yarmukian sites? 84</page><page sequence="105">PART II STRATIGRAPHY</page><page sequence="106">CHAPTER 7 THE STRATIGRAPHY OF AREA E PURPOSE OF THE EXCAVATION At the beginning of the first seáson in 1989, Y. Garfinkel walked through the fields of Kibbutz Sha'^ar Hagolan searching for a suitable location for excavation. The whole area was covered with fishponds and manga, avocado and olive groves. Eventually, three possibilities were settled upon: one at the southwestern edge of the site close to Stekelis's Area D, one at the site's northwestern end, and the third in a narrow strip between rows of olive trees. The trees had been planted in the gap between two fishponds and over the years some of them had died, leaving small empty patches in which we could excavate. We began work in the southwestern area by opening a probe trench and digging down about one meter. Nothing at all was found; the area was completely free of archaeological finds. We then brought in a backhoe that dug a narrow trench to a depth of 3 m., down to the groundwater level. No evidence of early human activity was seen in the sides of the trench or in the soil that was removed. Close to this spot, the backhoe dug another trench in which nothing was found. By now it was clear that there was no point in continuing in this area and the backhoe was sent to the second location, at the northwestern end of the site. Here, a trench dug to a considerable depth also failed to turn up any finds. We then turned to the strip between the olive trees with the feeling that if here too nothing would be found, the excavation project at Sha'ar Hagolan would come to an untimely end. The backhoe dug a trench at the edge of the area, near the embankment of a fishpond. After it had finished work and the dust had settled, the trench was approached with some trepidation. We could see stones in the side of the trench and potsherds and flints in the heaps of excavated soil, and it was clear that we should concentrate our efforts at this spot. This area, which we called Area E in continuation of Stekelis's series of areas (see plan Fig 8.1), was marked out with a grid of one-meter squares and we began digging (Fig. 7.1). Within a few days we had uncovered two straight, narrow stone walls that formed a corner, and within the corner stood a basalt mortar containing a basalt pebble pestle (Fig. 7.2, top right). To our surprise, we realized that immediately below the surface soil we had encountered an 8000-year-old occupation level containing evidence of rectilinear architecture. In another week of excavation we had uncovered a rectangular room with narrow stone walls (Fig. 7.2). Near the room we found another basalt mortar (which was later stolen from the excavation site and never recovered). We had thus established that rectilinear structures with stone walls were the norm at the site. We did not yet know that this room was merely a small part of a huge structure that would take us twelve years to excavate completely. What we had uncovered completely contradicted the scholarly consensus that the Yarmukian people were semi- nomadic herders who did not build permanent structures, but lived in tents and shallow pits. An even greater surprise awaited us in another square to the east. Here we uncovered a massive Fig. 7.1 . Area E at the beginning of the first season of excavations in 1989 (from the east). Fig. 7.2. Area E, the first room uncovered in the 1989 season (from the north). 87</page><page sequence="107">CHAPTER 7 Fig. 7.3. Area E, the massive wall of Building Complex I at the end of the 1989 excavation season (from the south). Fig. 7.4. Area E at the end of the 1996 season (from the south). stone wall (Wall E7/E41), 1 m. wide, which continued over 4 m. from the northern to the southern ends of the excavation area (Fig. 7.3). A year later, in 1990, we continued to excavate in Area E, expanding it northward into the embankment of the adjacent fishpond. We exposed another 2 m. of the massive stone wall and found that it formed a corner with another wall of similar dimensions (Wall E 15), which continued eastward beyond the excavation area (see below, Fig. 7.24). By the end of the season, we had excavated the entire area at our disposal and reached the olive trees on the east and west, the fishpond embankment on the north, and a dirt road and the riverbank on the south. Thus, although the massive corner we had uncovered suggested the potential for unique discoveries awaiting us below the surface of Sha'ar Hagolan, the excavation project had to be stopped. It was clear, however, that we would return at the earliest opportunity. During the 1990s, the price of water in Israel rose sharply, affecting the farming policy of Kibbutz Sha'ar Hagolan. The fishponds were abandoned and drained, the mango and avocado groves uprooted, and the kibbutz turned to other crops. This new reality made additional areas available for excavation, and in 1996 we were able to renew work at the site and carry out our third excavation season. With the assistance of the Jewish National Fund, the embankments of the fishponds next to the previously excavated area were removed, and the area was prepared for excavation. In that season we had no budget for excavation and work was carried out at minimal cost. We followed the massive walls we had discovered in 1990, and found that one of them continued southward for about 30 m. and had a round room at its end. Four other walls were seen to reach the massive wall and form corners with it: the one we had encountered in the previous season and three others running eastward out of the excavation area (Fig. 7.4). Although the evidence was fragmentary, it was clear that this was architecture on a scale previously unknown in our region during the Neolithic period. From 1997 onwards, we continued to follow the massive walls and uncovered the entire building, which was named Building Complex I (Fig. 7.5). From 1998 till 2001, the excavation area was enlarged to 1700 sq. m. (Fig. 7.6). The main efforts of the excavation in Area E were concentrated 88</page><page sequence="108">THE STRATIGRAPHY OF AREA E Fig. 7.5. Area E at the end of the 1997 season (from the south). Fig. 7.6.

Area E, plan of post-Neolithic features (Strata E1-E2). on the best-preserved Yarmukian stratum (Stratum E-4), and a full exposure of complete buildings. Earlier strata were reached only in a number of probes. By the close of the 2001 season, two building complexes (I and II) were fully excavated, together with fragments of at least three additional building complexes (III, IV and V). At this point, it was decided to stop the excavations in Area E. However, during the 2003 season, several small probes were excavated down to virgin soil (Probes 1, 2 and 3, see pp. 102-104 and Fig. 7.41), to achieve a complete stratigraphie sequence and improve our understanding of this area prior to final publication. This was accomplished and a distinct Pre-Pottery Neolithic C stratum was discovered, lying on the virgin soil. STRATIGRAPHY The eight strata identified in Area E are presented here from top to bottom, as they were excavated. The discussion of the main Yarmukian occupation, Stratum E-4, is presented in Chapter 8. STRATUM E-ls TOPSOIL (Plan Fig. 7.7; Table 7.1) Stratum E-l represents a layer of modern fishpond sediment and regular alluvial topsoil containing Byzantine and Islamic finds mixed with both earlier and modern artifacts. This stratum, which varies in thickness, was defined in all the excavation areas. In general, it is a dark brown, granular, rather compacted layer, in some cases rich in plant roots.

Area E, the western section of Square G43d. where agricultural and other activities had penetrated the upper Yarmukian layers, the alluvial topsoil was nearly non-existent, or had settled between the top levels of the walls. Although basically the topsoil is defined as a non- architectural stratum in Area E, several features may be assigned to it (Table 7.1). A number of irrigation trenches, such as Locus E295, a straight, narrow trench in Squares H42d-H43c (Fig. 7.8), are cut into Yarmukian strata. On the southern edge of the excavated area, a river terrace created by an earlier bed of the Yarmuk River has eroded the Neolithic remains. In Square G43d, this river terrace was filled with modern material, mainly plastic irrigation pipes (Locus E276, Figs. 7.9-7.10). A small rounded pit in Square K44d (Pit E471), reflecting later or modern activities, also penetrated into the Yarmukian street level, as did a feature in Square I43b consisting of two rows of large stone slabs standing on their narrow sides with two large flat slabs covering them (E507, Fig. 7.11). These slabs had been inserted into a pit and may be the remains of a later cist grave (possibly of Byzantine/ Islamic date). A similar phenomenon in the same square is Pit E378, containing a few large flat stone slabs. Although neither pit contained remains that could date it, similar graves are well known from the Byzantine and Late Islamic periods in the region (U. Cohen personal communication; see also Area N, Chapter 12). A group of stones located at a high level in Square I42c was also assigned to Stratum E-l (Locus E593). 91</page><page sequence="111">CHAPTER 7 Table 7.1 Loci of Stratum E-l (for further details see Appendix 1).

Part of an MB I village was excavated at Sha'ar Hagolan, in the fishpond northwest of Area E, by E. Eisenberg in 1980 (Eisenberg 1993). However, in Area E there are few architectural remains from this period. In most places, Stratum E-2 comprises fills of debris, some rich in MB I pottery, or pits assigned to this period by the same criteria (Table 7.2). The most substantial feature of Stratum E-2 is a fill in an elongated depression extending from the western edge of the excavated area eastwards. This was probably created by a local gully postdating the Yarmukian occupation at the site and cutting through various Yarmukian features, but predating the MB I occupation or contemporary with it (MB I Disturbance E636). The depression was a convenient area for garbage disposal during the MB I. This gully, located mainly in Squares J42c-d and I42-I43a-b, is probably aligned with a similar gully cutting Area G from east to west (MB I Disturbance G3). Several other debris layers in Area E contained MB I finds, particularly those in Rooms U and S of Building Complex II and the southern part of Building Complex V (all of which are near Disturbance E636).

Area E, MB I Pit E463 containing a pottery jar. A number of pits that penetrated the main Yarmukian stratum (E-4) are designated Stratum E-2, for example, the relatively deep rectangular Pit E46 in Squares H44d-H45c (at least 2 m. deep, not completely excavated), which cuts Wall El 5 (Fig. 7.12). This pit may be the remains of an MB I shaft tomb, although this could only have been verified by excavating the entire depth of the shaft to reveal the burial chamber. Similar MB I shaft tombs were excavated in the Jordan Valley at the nearby site of Menahamya (Bahat 1976) and in the large cemetery of Jericho (with rectangular shafts, Kenyon 1961: Tomb J4, Fig. 107). Other installations in Stratum E-2 include Pit E 147, a rounded pit lined with three courses of stones (Fig. 7.13), together with Pit E147a that cuts Wall E 168 of Building Complex III in Square G46c, the large rounded Pit E86a in Square G46a-c that destroyed parts of Walls E106 and E107, Pit E84a in Square H46c, Pit E122 in Square G46a, Pit E165 in Square I46b, the oval Pit E373 in Square I43d and Locus E669 in Square G42b. Pit E463 in Square I43b contained a complete jar typical of the MB I repertoire (Fig. 7.14). Concentrations of stones and fill layers cutting Wall E442 of Building Complex II (Square J43b-d), including a rounded stone concentration (E527), either a pit or an installation, may also be assigned to Stratum E-2. In summary, the MB I remains in Area E are different in nature from those excavated by E. Eisenberg, which comprised densely built architecture. The remains in Area E probably reflect activity areas on the outskirts of the main settlement, such as living floors and work areas, pits and a grave shaft. STRATUM E-3: YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 7.15; Table 73) Stratum E-3 is the uppermost Neolithic level detected in Area E. Few architectural elements can be assigned to this phase, which in most cases is a technical stratum denoting the fill layer above the walls and architectural features of Stratum E-4. Nevertheless , this stratum may have contained several elements of an upper Yarmukian settlement, which were eroded over the millennia or destroyed more recently by fishpond construction or other modern agricultural activities. Most loci assigned Stratum E-3 are light-gray fills, a sediment originating from decomposed mudbricks. Architectural elements include a wall fragment north of Building Complex I in Square I46a (Wall E85, Fig. 7.16), which is not aligned with any walls of Stratum E-4 and floats above the debris in Open Area 52 (Stratum E-4). In Square I43b, above the western edge of Courtyard A of Building Complex II, a single row of stones lies above Stratum E-4 walls (Wall E454) and may be designated a wall fragment of Stratum E-3; it is cut by MB I Disturbance E636. In Square I42c-d, a group of flat burnt stones (E573, Fig. 7.17 top) lies above Pavement E578 (Fig. 7.17 bottom), which is made of rounded and angular stones of various sizes. Although both of these features are higher than any of the Stratum E-4 architectural elements in the area, the material culture associated with them is Yarmukian. A line of stones (E644) above a wall of Stratum E-4 in Square I42c-d may also belong to Stratum E-3. In Square J43b, above Wall E526 of Phase E-4A, a concentration of large stones (E653) may represent 93</page><page sequence="113">CHAPTER 7 Fig. 7.15. Area E, plan of Stratum E-3. Fig. 7.16.

A dark fill with stones (possibly a pit) in Square H42b (E687) is similarly located at a higher level and thus assigned to this stratum. STRATUM E-4: YARMUKIAN Stratum E-4 is the main Yarmukian stratum in Area E, 1700 sq. m. of which were unearthed. As Chapter 8 is dedicated to this occupational phase, only a brief description is provided here. The architectural layout includes two complete building complexes (I and II) , three partially exposed building complexes (III, IV and V), several open areas, and two passageways between the buildings. This stratum is covered in several places by fills of Stratum E-3, while in others it is penetrated or disturbed by elements of Stratum E-2. However, in most cases, the remains of Stratum E-4 lie immediately below the topsoil (Stratum E-l), which sometimes consists of only a thin layer of several centimeters. The Stratum E-4 architectural remains, comprising the stone foundations and sometimes part of the brick superstructure of the walls, are rarely preserved to a height greater than 0.30-0.50 m. Between the walls we uncovered floor levels, pavements, installations, and debris and fills. In general, excavation was stopped when the base of the walls of Stratum E-4 was reached. The best preservation was in the areas covered by the fishpond embankments, as in Squares I45a-b and I46a. By and large, the remains from Stratum E-4 reflect a single constructional phase; this is true especially in Building Complex I and the eastern and southern parts of Building Complex II. Two, or sometimes three, phases of Stratum E-4 were observed mainly in the western and northern parts of Building Complex II and in several other places. In these cases, walls were altered, cancelled or added. When several superimposed floor or debris levels are related to the same walls, the different floors are assigned to phases of Stratum E-4 (E-4A, E-4B, E-4C). However, walls or features lying below the walls of Stratum E-4 were assigned to Stratum E-5. This occurred mainly below the western part of Building Complex II and the central part of Building Complex I, where a thick fill was excavated below the Stratum E-4 floor levels. The general impression is that, apart from some local alterations throughout the lifespan of the Stratum E-4 buildings, the basic framework of the architecture was maintained, confirming the assignation of almost all the architectural remains in Area E to a single main Yarmukian occupation, Stratum E-4. The locus list of Stratum E-4 is presented in Appendix 1 . STRATUM E-5: YARMUKIAN (Fig. 7.18; Table 7.4) Stratum E-5 was reached only in several probes below Stratum E-4 and in most cases represents fills excavated below the lower floor levels and walls of Stratum E-4, although in certain areas this stratum can be defined architecturally (Table 7.4). This is the case with the massive outer walls of Buildings I and II that face the street. The western wall of Building Complex I, Wall E15a, lies below Wall E15 of Stratum E-4 in Squares I-H45a in exactly the same orientation in the section (Fig. 7.19). The lower wall continues to the north of Building Complex I for at least 5 m. The eastern wall of Building Complex II shows a similar phenomenon, with Wall E41 of Stratum E-5 lying below Wall E7 of Stratum E-4 (Squares I-G44a-c) (Fig. 7.20). In accordance with the two phases of massive walls, two street levels were discerned (Fig. 7.21). The lower street level relating to the Stratum E-5 walls was excavated in Squares I45c (E59) and H45c-G54a (E721c). In Square H45, under the floor level of Room C of Building Complex I, remains of a lower stratum were reached that comprise fragments of two stone walls (E56 and E66, Fig. 7.22), which are parallel to and contemporary with Wall E15a. All the features of Buildings I and II that lie as low as Walls E 15a and E41 were assigned to Stratum E-5, although it is difficult to correlate these remains with the three different phases of the stratum observed in the probe in Building 95</page><page sequence="115">CHAPTER 7 Fig. 7.18.

For example, Wall E271a adjoins Wall E41 in Open Area J of Building Complex II. A line of stones near this wall also belongs to Stratum E-5. A thick mudbrick wall in Squares H43d-44c (Wall E710, see Figs. 3.11-3.12) lies below the floor level of Courtyard A; only the upper courses of bricks from this wall were excavated. It seems to be either an east-west division of the courtyard or possibly the southern wall of Building Complex II in Stratum E-5. In several instances, only the fill layer of Stratum E-5 was excavated below the Stratum E-4 floor levels, while the architectural elements of Stratum E-5 were not reached, as in Room B of Building Complex I and Rooms C (Locus E34), G (E297), H-I (E250) and J (E271) of Building Complex II, together with Open Area D (E31) of the same complex. In most cases this fill was rich in mudbrick material but poor in material-culture remains. In the 1989 trench through the southern side of Room E of Building Complex II (Square H44b) (see above, pp. 87-88), several features and stone concentrations lying below Stratum E-4 were noted. The Probe in Courtyard A of Building Complex I (Squares H45c-d-G45a-b) In the northwestern part of the courtyard of Building Complex I (Squares H45c-d-G45a-b), a square probe measuring ca. 5 Fig. 7.19.

This probe was initiated in the second season (1990) and continued during the final season (2003). Remains of Stratum E-5 in this probe included three constructional phases (Phases E-5 A, B, C). The eastern face of Wall E 15a remains covered by sediment that was not removed, since Stratum E-4 Wall El 5 rests partly on top of Wall E15a and partly on sediment to the east of it. Since we did not remove the upper wall, the exact line of the earlier wall is unknown. Phase E-5 A (Figs. 7.23-7.24). The relatively thick fill of ca. 0.60 m. that was excavated in the probe was very poor in finds (Locus E32) and may be interpreted as a constructional fill lying above several features designated as Phase E-5 A. These include E39, a fragmentary north-south stone wall, and Grinding Installation E45a, comprising a massive basalt slab. In the northeastern part of the square, a section of a stone pavement measuring 1 x 1 m. was discovered (Pavement E785, Fig. 7.25). This pavement also existed in Phase E-5B. The grinding stone and the pavement mark the floor level of Phase E-5A. It should be noted that the lower courses of Wall E29 (the southern wall of Rooms C-D in Stratum E-4) reach the elevations of the Stratum E-5 floor. The area probably functioned as an open courtyard, as it did in Stratum E-4, indicating clear continuity in the architecture of Building Complex I between Strata E-5 and E-4. Phase E-5B (Figs. 7.26-7.27). Below Wall E39 and the debris layers of Phase E-5 A, several features were exposed, all lying on a similar level representing the Phase E-5B floor, which was still an open courtyard. Wall E784, in a fragmentary state of preservation, lies below Wall E39, and probably has a similar width and orientation. Several stones just west of Wall E784 may be remains of another wall perpendicular to it. In the northwestern part of the square, an installation wall (E789, Fig. 7.28) has an east- west orientation (at a right angle to Wall E784) and probably adjoins the outer wall of the building (E15a). Parallel to Wall E789 and ca. 2 m. to the south, a narrower wall was unearthed (Wall E794), preserved Fig. 7.23. Area E, plan of Phase E-5 A. 98</page><page sequence="118">THE STRATIGRAPHY OF AREA E to a length of 0.50 m . These wall fragments may represent an inner partition of the courtyard, or installations within it. Also belonging to Phase E-5B are two rounded installations: the southern one (E787, Fig. 7.29), comprising a circle of stones (0.40 m. in diameter) with burnt stone and mud in the center, is probably a hearth; the northern installation (E786), which is quite similar but not as well preserved, also comprises a circle Fig. 7.24.

In the west, between Walls E794 and E789, a concentration of large stones is probably a rounded pit (E788, Fig. 7.30), 1 m. in diameter and ca. 0.35 m. deep. Phase E-5C (Fig. 7.31). The lowest phase of Stratum E-5, Phase E-5C, is an open courtyard containing several installations (Fig. 7.32). Stones E797 (wall fragment?) were found underlying Wall E784 of Phase B (Fig. 7.33). To the north of these stones, three pits were identified: an elongated pit filled with stones (E806), a rounded pit 1 m. in diameter (E811), and an elongated pit (E800) measuring 1 x 1.5 m. and 0.65 m. deep (Fig. 7.34). The western end of Pit E800 is wider and filled with large stones, while its eastern end is filled with dark, organic (?) material. Two parallel lines of stones (E796) are probably an installation of some kind, and to the north of this a curved line of stones (E795) is possibly part of a poorly preserved hearth. A rounded concentration of large stones (E799 just north of Pit E800 is probably a hearth, 0.50 m. in diameter, while another concentration of medium-sized stones (E798) is 0.40 m. in diameter. In the northeastern part of the square, a stone pavement (E807, Fig. 7.35) underlies Pavement E785 of Phases E-5A-B and is similar in form. These pavements are separated by a debris layer. Pavement E807 seems to reach the lower courses of Wall E29. 100 1 trench (1989) ļ 29 JES ' 21543 ríialñSii y^; ,M 4m i ■ 'r~' a ™ i I; pV; &lt; 0**-^ j?&gt; 7803 filli ■ H ©°Ý°, - s i ^ Wmq U -215'74 : . . /-215.2^0 U I .

In summary, it seems that the architecture of Stratum E-5, although covered with a constructional fill, did not differ in its general orientation from Stratum E-4. This is especially true in Building Complex I, where the Stratum E-4 walls follow the lines of the Stratum E-5 walls (as demonstrated in the courtyard probe). However, as the lower Stratum E-5 Fig. 7.36. Area E, Stratum E-5 below Room C in Building Complex II. walls were exposed only in very limited sections, the plan of the earlier buildings cannot be reconstructed. For example, Wall E710 (see Fig. 3.12) may have been the southern wall of Building Complex II in this stage, although this cannot be ascertained. Thus, the size, shape and inner divisions of the buildings may have been quite different from those of the later Stratum E-4. STRATUM E-6: YARMUKIAN (Fig. 737; Table 7.5) Stratum E-6 is defined as the stratum that lies below the level of the Stratum E-5 walls (i.e., Walls E15a, E29 and E41; see Fig. 7.18). This stratum was reached only in the probe in Courtyard A of Building Complex I (Squares H45c-d-G45a-b) and in another small (1 x 1 m.) probe excavated in Square I44b, below Open Area J of Building Complex II (Figs. 7. 38-7 .38a). Stratum E-6 was excavated to a depth of ca. 0.50 m. In the probes in Building Complex I, several features were exposed below the architecture. As the material culture includes significant amounts of pottery, this level is dated to an early Yarmukian phase. The excavated remains are of an open area containing two large flat stones (a hearth?) sloping southwards (E810, Fig. 7.39) and another installation (E812) comprising a circle of large stones with the inner part covered with mud plaster. In the southeastern part of the larger probe in Squares H45c-d-G45a-b, a rectangular stone concentration, 1 x 0.40 m., is most probably another hearth (E808, Fig. 7.40). In the small probe in Square I44b, this stratum was roughly defined below the Stratum E-5 debris layer and the lowest level of Wall E41 (see Fig. 7.18). A debris layer and an installation comprising several stones standing on their narrow sides (Installation E347) were uncovered in this lowest level. Table 7.5.

STRATUM E-7: PRE-POTTERY NEOLITHIC C (Fig. 7.41; Table 7.6) In four probes excavated in Area E (see below) , a distinct cultural horizon predating the Yarmukian settlement was identified. It comprises a thick debris layer containing rich material remains including flint, stone and bone artifacts, but no pottery. Due to the absence of pottery, along with the flint arrowheads and sickle blades typical of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C (PPNC, Garfinkel 1994), this phase, designated Stratum E-7, is dated to the PPNC (8100-7500 BP, uncalibrated; 7000-6400 BCE, calibrated). This horizon was also revealed in the lower part of Area G. Stratum E-7 was exposed in four small probes measuring roughly 3 x 2 m. each, three in the street and one in the courtyard of Building Complex I (Figs. 7.41-7.42): 1) Probe E751 in Squares J-I44-45, the northernmost probe; 2) Probe E759 in Square I44c; 3) Probe E775 in Square H45a; 4) A 2 x 2-m. probe in the western courtyard of Building Complex I (Locus E813, Square H45c). The Stratum E-7 debris is ca. 1.10-1.20 m. thick in the street probes (elevations -215.1 8/-2 1 5 .26 to -216.30/-216.36 m.). The lower 0.20-0.30 m. contain a much lower frequency of finds and are mixed with the river wash of Stratum E-8 (see sections in Figs. 7.43-7.46). In the probe beneath the courtyard Fig. 7.39.

The reason for this is unclear; one possible explanation is that the Yarmukian building was constructed with a floor deeper than the contemporary street level, thus creating a partially sunken structure. Stratum E-7 can be described as a debris layer without clear walls, floors or installations. It seems to have been an open area, perhaps near dwellings, where occupation debris and garbage were dumped. Three separate thick, whitish debris layers can be discerned in Probe 1 (E751; Figs. 7.43^44, 7.46) and are tentatively defined as Phases E-7A, E-7B and E-7C. Each phase comprises a layer of debris rich in finds, 0.20-0.50 m. thick, separated by fill layers containing fewer finds. Fig. 7.41 . Area E, PPNC remains. STRATUM E-8: THE RIVER WASH (Table 7.7) Stratum E-8 represents the sterile layer lying below the archaeological remains, or virgin soil. This layer was reached only in limited areas of 1 x 1 m. within Probes 1, 2 and 3 in the southern part of the street (Fig. 7.45), and in Probe 4 below Courtyard A of Building Complex I.

The layer of Lisan Marl uncovered in Area G below the river wash was not reached in Area E, as the accumulation of river wash is apparently thicker in Area E. According to the northern Probe 1 (E751) in Squares J-I44-45, the thickness of this layer, appearing at an elevation of -216.25 m., is at least 0.35 m. This is not surprising, as Area E is closer to the Yarmuk River. This river-wash layer appears in Area E at an elevation ca. 1 m. lower than in Area G, which testifies to the natural topography of the site in the Neolithic period: a slope descending from north to south towards the river.

The current publication comprises the detailed and updated final report of the results from Area E, integrating both published and previously unpublished materials. THE GENERAL LAYOUT OF THE AREA (Plan Fig. 8.1) The architecture of Stratum E-4 illustrates a high degree of village planning rarely encountered on such a scale at Neolithic sites of the ancient Near East (Garfinkel and Ben- Shlomo 2002a: 69; 2002b: 81-82). A straight street 3 m. wide divided the area on a north-south axis (Street E8), extending at least 40 m. In the north it curves slightly to the west into the unexcavated area, while in the south, towards the bank of the Yarmuk River, this street ends in an open area (Piazza E204). Building Complex I lies to the east of Street E8. On the southeastern edge of the excavated area a fragment of another building (Building Complex III) was excavated. It is separated from Building Complex I by a narrow alleyway (El 09), which also leads to Piazza E204. To the north of Building Complex I, a large, open area that continues northwards and eastwards into the unexcavated area may be an independent unit or part of a larger structure, or perhaps an open area connected to Building Complex I. Such a large open area may have been an enclosure for domestic animals. The huge Building Complex II, to the west of Street E8, is adjoined from the west by Building IV in the south and Building V in the north. These two buildings were only partly excavated and continue westwards. The southern and northern outer walls of Building Complex II seem to continue as the outer walls of Buildings IV and V respectively, implying a system of insulae combining several building complexes within a wider framework. To the north of Building Complex II, a small area was excavated facing Street E8 that seems to be the beginning of another building or open area. Most of the architecture in Area E (especially the general plan of the buildings) displays no sub-phasing and can be defined in general as Stratum E-4. However, in a number of locations two sub-phases were discerned, indicating localized alterations or additions of walls and installations or the raising of floors. In these places, the elements were denoted Phases E-4 A and E-4B. It should be noted that strict contemporaneity cannot be assumed between all the elements of each of these phases throughout Area E, and these terms are used for the sake of simplicity. In cases where these changes reflect modifications in the inner plan of the buildings (especially in Building Complex II), two separate plans are presented. THE STREET SYSTEM Main Street E8 One of the most remarkable aspects of the remains in Area E is the formalized street system separating the major buildings. The main street, denoted Street E8 (Figs. 8.2-8.3), runs straight in a north-south orientation for some 30 m. in Squares G45a-G44b to J44d. From there it curves gently to the northwest, continuing for another ca. 10 m. through Squares J44d-K44c-d and into the unexcavated area. The width of the street ranges slightly from 1.7-2.0 m. in the north to 2.9-3.2 m. in the south. The main street existed along the same orientation in both Strata E-4 and E-5, with surfaces of mud plaster (Fig. 8.4) or small, rounded flint pebbles (maximum diam. 1-2 cm.) in a packed mud-plaster matrix (Fig. 8.5, Color Plate Vlllb; see also Fig. 3.7). The surface was evidently renewed regularly, as several layers can be observed in places. Street levels of Stratum E-4, with Stratum E-5 below them, were identified in Squares K44d, J44d and H45a (Loci E467, E460 and E721a-c respectively). The surface of the street slopes sharply southward toward the Yarmuk River at a rate of ca. 0.10-0.15 m. per 10 m., reflecting the ancient topography of the area. Thus, the main street could have served as a drainage system channeling rainwater to the river. It should be noted that very few finds were retrieved on the street surfaces, which were also devoid of mudbrick debris. Moreover, no passages from any of the rooms or courtyards of Buildings I and II were detected. These facts would seem to indicate a very low level of human activity in the street, rather unusual for the main street for a village, and may be due to regular sweeping of the street surface by the Yarmukian inhabitants. The appearance and maintenance of the main street thus reflects a considerable degree of public effort and organization. Alleyway E109/Piazza E204 The alley between Buildings I and III has a maximum width of ca. 0.7-1 .6 m. and a winding course exposed to a length of 15 m. (Figs. 8.6-8.7, and see below, Fig. 8.25).

South of Building Complex I and west of Building Complex III lies an open area denoted Piazza E204. As the entrances of Building I and possibly of Building II, as well as Street E8, all face the piazza, it is perceived as a central gathering place for this part of the village located near the riverfront. Few data are available for this piazza, as its continuation to the south has been eroded away by the Yarmuk River. BUILDING COMPLEX I (Plan Fig. 8.8) Building Complex I (Figs. 8.2, 8.9-8.10; see also Fig. 7.5), the first completely excavated structure at Sha'ar Hagolan, is a typical courtyard building measuring approximately 17.3 x 15.8 m. (233 sq. m.). It appears to have been built in a single constructional phase, as no substantial additions or changes in the plan were noted and in most cases only one occupation layer was identified. An exception is the two phases of pavements in Room E, Phases E-4 A and E-4B. It should be noted, however, that in most cases the excavation did not continue below the base of the stone wall foundations. The building has the shape of an asymmetrical pentagon with two right angles and a narrow southern side and is divided into nine spaces: a large central courtyard (A), and eight rooms surrounding it (clockwise B through I). Building Complex I is delimited by stone walls, 0.80-1.20 m. wide. Walls E45, E135, E107 and E131/E62 are the outer walls of the rooms, while the western wall of the building (Wall E15), bordering 108 42 I 43 44 45 I 46 lf ¿X a*.

Area E, general view of Building Complex I with the main street and the alleyway. Fig. 8.3. Area E, the main street (from the north). Street E8, encloses Courtyard A along most of its length. The western, southern and eastern boundaries of the building are very clear and "formal", as they face Street E8, Plaza E204 and Alleyway E 109 respectively, while the northern boundary is less clear, being created by the outer walls of Rooms C, D and E. Wall E15a of Stratum E-5 (below Wall El) continues northwards beyond the boundary of Building Complex I. Wall El 5 of Stratum E-4 probably also continues in the same direction, but is not preserved at this level. The entrance to the building is through its southern wall (Wall E131), between Rooms B and I (see Fig. 3.1). It leads into Courtyard A and has a paved threshold about 1 .5 m. wide, built of large, flat river pebbles. The outer sides of the threshold stones are aligned with the stones of Wall E131. Near this entrance, Wall E71, running parallel to Wall E67, creates a rectangular niche, 0.80 m. wide and 1.4 m. long, which may be an additional room or perhaps a feature related to the main entrance (Fig. 8.11). No other entrance to Building Complex I was identified. Six of the eight rooms can be divided into three units of two rooms each: an unpaved room with an entrance onto the courtyard and an adjacent paved room with no discernible entrance (Rooms C-D, F-G, H-I). Room E has a similar subdivision within it, while Room B is exceptional in this respect. Courtyard A This is the largest and most dominant feature of Building 109</page><page sequence="128">CHAPTER 8 Fig. 8.4. Area E, close-up of the mud-plastered surface of Street E8. Fig. 8.5. Area E, close-up of the pebble pavement of Street E8. Complex I, as all entrances to the rooms and to the building itself are through the courtyard. The courtyard has a similar pentagonal shape to that of the building. Its area is 92 sq. m., ca. 60.5% of the net floor area of the building (for details Fig. 8.6 Area E, Alleyway E109 (from the northeast). on the individual rooms of Building Complex I, see Table 8.1). The courtyard's floor is mainly of beaten earth, which can be clearly defined by the various installations and pits located in it. A group of five rounded pits is located roughly in the center of the courtyard in Square H45b-d (Pits E22, E25, E33 and E38; Fig. 8.12). The pits have a diameter of ca. 1.2-1.3 m. and are no more than 0.50 m. deep. Between the pits and the western wall, El 5, two fragmentary stone walls create an L-shaped corner (El 9a and E 19b), which may be the remains of a partially preserved installation. To the north of these walls, Pavement E49, made of large flat stones, reaches the southern side of Wall E29 of Room C. To the south, in Square H45c, a rounded area of large flat stones is probably the pavement of an installation (E48, Figs. 8.13-14). It should be noted that these two pavements are not as densely laid as the stone pavements inside the rooms. A well-defined floor level rich in finds and paved with small angular pebbles is located in Square G45b near the entrance to the building (E53). A similar but larger paved area, about 1.5 m. in diameter, lies near Room G in Square H46c (El 15). Near Pavement El 15, a probe exposed a lower floor level (E647, Phase E-4B).

The exceptional shape of Room B suggests that, at least at some stage, this room was different in function from the other rooms of the building. Room C This is a large rectangular room, the largest room of Building Complex I (Fig. 8.19), delineated by Walls E29 on the south, E15 on the west, E45 on the north and E65 on the east. The western and northern walls of the room are the outer walls of the building and therefore relatively thick (up to 1.2 m.). Some of the brick superstructure of the western wall was preserved. The southern wall (E29) is also thick, and even has a rectangular buttress adjoining it from the south measuring approximately 1.2 x 0.35 m., probably to reinforce the wall. The probe excavated in the courtyard revealed that this wall and its buttress also existed in the earlier phases of Stratum E-5 (see above, Figs. 7.24, 7.27). The entrance to the room from the courtyard is in its southwestern corner, near Wall E 15, through the longer wall, E29. Thus, this room can be defined as a typical broadroom, an architectural form that was popular in the Levant during later periods as well (Herzog 1980; Porath 1985; Ben-Shlomo Fig. 8.11. Area E, the southeastern corner of the courtyard of Building Complex I with Wall E71 (from the north). Fig. 8.12.

Below the beaten-earth floor of Room C (E51, Fig. 8.20), Stratum E-5 remains, including wall fragments E56 and E66, were reached (see Fig. 7.18). This room may have already existed in the Stratum E-5 building, with Wall E 15a as its western wall. However, as the Stratum E-4 architecture was not dismantled and the lower floor levels were not Fig. 8.15.

Room D has no discernible entrance, either from Courtyard A or from Room C. The entire room is densely and neatly paved with medium-sized and large, flat river pebbles (Pavement E91). One of the stones in the pavement is a lower grinding stone in secondary use. The pavement reaches all four walls of the room. Room E This is a rectangular room on the eastern side of Building Complex I (Fig. 8.22), delineated by Walls E 132 on the 115</page><page sequence="134">CHAPTER 8 Fig. 8.19.

Its orientation creates an angle of ca. 150° with Room D, deriving from the angle between Street E8 and Alleyway E 109 and from the choice to maintain the rectangular shape of the rooms. The single point of connection between Rooms D and E created a vulnerable spot that required additional support (Figs. 8.23-8.24). Walls E 1 29 and E 1 35 form part of the northeastern boundary of Building Complex I. Some of the brick superstructure of Wall E135 was preserved. Wall E175 adjoins the corner of these two walls from the north, and is possibly a later addition. The southeastern wall of Room E (Wall E 107) is the eastern outer wall of Building Complex I, facing Alleyway E 109. Its eastern corner is not preserved. This wall apparently continues eastwards to the edge of the excavated area (now designated Wall E 137), confining an open (?) area outside Building 116</page><page sequence="135">THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRATUM E-4 Fig. 8.22. Area E, Room E of Building Complex I (from the south). Complex I, similarly to the northward continuation of Wall E15. The southwestern wall of Room E (Wall E 132) faces Courtyard A and Room F. The entrance to the room from the courtyard is in the center of this long wall, creating another typical broadroom. The entrance consists of Pavement E124, 0.75 X 1.2 m., made of large, flat river pebbles (Fig. 8.25; see also Fig. 3.2), which slopes down towards the courtyard. This pavement is substantially higher than the foundation stones of Wall E 132. However, since in our understanding Pavement E 124 does not cancel Wall E 132 but rather the floor level rose over time and the walls were renovated, the entrance relates to the upper phase. At the southern edge of Pavement E 124, a rounded circle of stones was discerned (El 23, Fig. 8.26) that may have functioned as a socket related to the door of Room E, perhaps for an outer jamb. Underneath Pavement E124 was an earlier and better-preserved pavement of similar nature (Pavement E 127), which can be assigned to Phase E-4B. In the southern part of Room E, the floor is of beaten earth. An L-shaped wall is located in the southwestern corner of the room (Wall E 155), adjoining Wall E 132 and creating a rectangular (1 .50 x 0.60 m.) niche or part of an installation. The wall consists of a single row of stones, possibly complemented by walling made of perishable materials. Under the Phase Fig. 8.23.

Area E, close-up of the socket (?) adjacent to the threshold of Room E of Building Complex I. m.), is made of large, flat, densely arranged river pebbles, quite typical of the paved rooms in Building Complex I. Several flat stones standing on their narrow sides ("standing stones") were found on its periphery and may have supported some partial walling. The western part of northern Room E is paved in a different style with smaller, angular pebbles (Pavement E171 , 1 .4 X 1 .1 m.), and several "standing stones" encircle this pavement as well (see Fig. 3.32). These two pavements are rectangular and of similar size, and can be interpreted as floors of silos or storage facilities, perhaps with different functions or built in succession (although their elevations are similar). Under Pavement E 154 is a lower pavement of similar nature (El 54a), while below Pavement E 1 7 1 a lower pavement (E 1 7 1 a) of large flat pebbles was observed. As the upper pavements were not dismantled, only the edges of these Phase E-4B pavements were exposed, but it seems that in the lower phase all the pavements were of uniform style, made of large flat pebbles. While Room E is considered a single room, it can be divided into an unpaved living area connected to the courtyard and a paved storage area, resembling the other three units of Building Complex I. Room F This is one of four rooms along the eastern side of Building Complex I (Fig. 8.27). It is square in shape, delineated by Walls El 16 on the southwest, E87 on the northwest, E84 on the northeast and E 107 on the southeast. The rather unusual entrance to this room from Courtyard A (Fig. 8.28) is in the eastern corner, through Wall E84. This wall runs parallel to Wall E132 of Room E, leaving a gap 0.50 m. wide between them that creates an indirect passage, a phenomenon that does not occur elsewhere at Sha'ar Hagolan. Room F has a beaten- Fig. 8.27. Area E, the eastern side of Building Complex I, Rooms F-I (from the south). Fig. 8.28.

Room G has no discernible entrance either to the courtyard or to Rooms F or H. The room has a stone pavement of large flat pebbles (see Fig. 3 .29) that is only partly preserved. As previously discussed, Room G can be paired with Room F, creating a dwelling unit consisting of an unpaved and a paved room. Room H This is a rectangular room adjacent to Room G and slightly larger (Fig. 8.29), delineated by Walls E68 on the southwest, E67 on the northwest (the continuation of Wall E87), E99 on the northeast and E 107 on the southeast. The entrance from the courtyard is in the center of Wall E67 . The floor of Room H is of beaten earth, and in the eastern corner a rounded concentration of medium-sized, angular burnt stones is identified as a hearth (E70a). Two upside-down basalt grinding stones were found in this room above debris that had accumulated on the Phase E-4B floor level (El 08). It is thus possible that the room had an upper floor of Phase E-4 A that was not discerned or preserved, on which the grinding stones rested.

There is no discernible entrance, either to the courtyard or to Room H. The room has a completely preserved stone pavement made of densely packed, large flat pebbles (E69, see Fig. 3.4), although the layers of MB I fill in this area reach right down to the level of the pavement. Room I can be paired with Room H as a dwelling unit consisting of an unpaved and a paved room. THE OPEN AREA NORTH OF BUILDING COMPLEX I (Plan Fig. 831) The relatively large (nearly 200 sq. m.) area excavated to the north of Building Complex I was essentially open, as it would not have been possible to roof this entire space (Fig. 8.32). It is connected in some way to Building Complex I, or to another building or unit lying to the north of Building Complex I. The whole area was assigned to a single constructional phase, Stratum E-4, although it may reflect activities spanning a considerable length of time. A number of installations, pits and other features are located in this area, resembling the components of the large open courtyards inside the buildings. The area north of Building Complex I can roughly be divided into four spaces: Open Areas E52, E61 , E83 and Space E136. Open Area E52 This is defined by the northern wall of Building Complex I (Wall E45) on the south, Wall E15 on the west and Wall E55 on the north, which separates Area E52 from Area E61 (Fig. 8.33). The eastern boundary of this area separating it from Open Area E83 is rather arbitrary and can be defined as the line continuing the course of Wall E55. Open Area E52 extends over an area of ca. 50 sq. m. and contains several features. In the southwestern corner (Square I45a) is an installation composed of large rounded stones (E60). A concentration of flat, angular river pebbles on the eastern side (Square I45b), measuring about 1.6x0.7 m., may be the remains of a pavement (E50). An area paved with small angular stones in the western part of the area may also be a floor foundation; it is delimited in the north (Square I45b) by a line of stones (E73). Just north of Wall E45 in Square I45d (El 50), a basalt mortar was found sunk in the floor (Fig. 8.34). The mortar's rim was encircled by smaller stones, apparently to raise the rim as the floor level rose. A similar circle of stones on top of a mortar was found in Building Complex II (E372). Open Area E61 This area, only partially excavated, is limited in the west by the fragmentary continuance of Wall El 5 (and Wall E 15a of Stratum E-5). Although this area is aligned along Street E8, no clear passage to the street was discerned. To the south, in Square I45c, the area is bounded by Wall E55 and on the east by Wall E55a, which creates a corner with Wall E55 and continues northwards into the unexcavated area. Wall E55a also separates Open Area E61 from Open Area E83. Another triangular portion of Open Area E61 was excavated in Square K44d east of Wall E461 (see Fig. 8.1); this area probably continues into most of Squares K45c-d and J45a-b-d, and was not excavated. A fragmentary stone wall in Square J45c (Wall E462) divides the area into two parts. In the southern part are three rounded, closely spaced pits (Pits E440, E443 and E444). Open Area E83 This is apparently a large area of which only the southern part was excavated in Squares I45c-I46a-d (Figs. 8.35-8.37). It continues northwards and eastwards into the unexcavated area and is delimited on the west by Wall E55a and Open Area E52, and on the south by Wall E190 of Space E136. The triangular area in Square I46c created by Walls E94 and E 129 of Building Complex I may also be added to this open area. Several shallow pits and other less well-defined elements are located in Open Area 83, and the debris is rich in assorted concentrations of stones. Two rounded pits were identified (E152 and E158), of which Pit E158 was filled with stones of various sizes. A complete clay figurine was recovered from Pit E152 (Fig. 8.38). Two other pits were identified in Open Area E83, E105 and E188, and a concentration of large stones in Square I46a may be remains of a wall (El 19). Several concentrations of angular stones of various sizes were found in the eastern part of the area with no defined shapes (El 70 and E 189). In Square I46b, a floor was observed below the stones (El 97). Space E136 This space, bordered on the east by the unexcavated area and triangular in shape, lies south of Open Area 83 and east of Wall E 135 of Building Complex I (see Fig. 8.8). Since it was only partly unearthed, its size or nature, whether a room or open area, could not be determined. Wall E190 is a single row of stones forming a corner with Wall E 175, a short, thick wall connected to the corner of Walls E129 and E135 of Room E. Wall E 175 was built either as a later addition or to reinforce the corner of Building Complex I. A similar phenomenon is seen in the southern corner of Space E 136 (see Fig. 8.8), where Wall E 137 continues the eastern corner of Building Complex I. In the middle of Space E136, in Square H46b, a large oval pit ca. 2 m. long was excavated to a depth of over 1 m. (E140). It was filled with thousands of medium-sized and small river pebbles (Fig. 8.39-8.40). Alternatively, this massive stone concentration may be interpreted as a pile of stones from a lower stratum (E-5), like that in Area G (G46). BUILDING COMPLEX III (Plan Fig. 8.8) The area east of Alleyway E 109 and Wall E 106 is designated Building Complex III (Fig. 8.41), although the nature of this very partially excavated area is far from clear. The area was defined as a building complex in accordance with the village's apparent plan, in which streets separate building complexes. The area excavated in Squares H46b and G46a-d is only the westernmost edge of a much larger structure. Moreover, several MB I pits penetrating from Stratum E-2 have substantially disturbed the area. Building Complex III is divided into Open Area A, which covers most of the excavated area (at least 13 m. long), and 120</page><page sequence="139">THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRATUM E-4 Fig. 8.31 . Area E, plan of the open area north of Building Complex I. Room B, which may in fact be an open area. Wall E 168 separates the two spaces, while Wall E174 is the eastern wall of Room B, continuing southwards into the unexcavated area. Open Area Aincludes several floors with related installations and pits (Figs. 8.42-8.43). Beaten-earth floor levels were identified in Square G46a-b (E164, E164a, E193). Installation E 187 in Square G46b consists of a rounded concentration of large angular stones about 0.40 m. in diameter and may be a hearth. To the north, in Square H46d, a pavement made of large flat pebbles (E198), measuring 0.70 x 0.40 m., was preserved. Nearby, a rectangular pit lined with stones (E145), measuring about 0.80 x 0.50 m., may be a hearth. Also located in Open Area A are the rounded Pit E179 in Square G46b and Pit E157 in Square H46d. Pit E179, of which only the western part was excavated, is 1 .5 m. wide and 0.25 m. deep. An excellently preserved basalt mortar was found in the topsoil above Open Area A and was probably dislocated from the floor level by recent agricultural activities. The nature of the elements in Open Area A, together with its size, attest that it was an open area or courtyard of a building, similar to the courtyards of Buildings I and II. Room B of Building Complex III may be interpreted as a rectangular room. Its northern wall (E168) is only partly preserved, as it is cut by a large pit of Stratum E-2 (El 47 a). The entrance to the room was probably located in this wall, which clearly adjoins Walls E106 in the west and E174 in the east. A fragmentary beaten-earth floor was identified in Square G46c (El 94). BUILDING COMPLEX II (Plan Fig. 8.1) The excavation of Building Complex II continued from the first season in 1989 through the 2001 season (Figs. 8.44- 8.47). While a partial description of this building (up to the 1998 excavation season) was presented in SHI (Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo 2002a: 62-68), various aspects have been changed since then, as additional walls and installations 121 ^ ¿5 I 46 ^^214.51^ ^ ^ ^ &lt;3 '2 462 Crf3»" VtJ N 462 ~ VtJ ¿3-214 68 N , ' '• ' NCT14 : „v? rwC? ^ o 5m ; I ^^21444 ■ 8y° x-v, ® IM ^^^*&lt;^214.57 f 152 J ~ Ogfi 2? yŠ Q ' g" V-#v214-51 nr&gt;R U S 2?

Area E, Open Area E5 2 at the end of the 1996 excavation season (from the south). were uncovered in the additional three seasons of 1999- 2001. Its area of approximately 710 sq. m. makes it the largest building at Sha'ar Hagolan, and possibly the largest building of the Neolithic Near East. Building Complex II is essentially a courtyard building like Building Complex I, with a central courtyard and several other open areas attached to it comprising the dominant element of the building. Due to its size and variable state of preservation, the interpretation of the architectural plan of this building is more complex than that of Building Complex I. Its general shape is an elongated rectangle with a protrusion to the west (Fig. 8.46). Thus, the building's general dimensions are ca. 25 x 17 m., but at its widest it reaches nearly 40 m. The entire eastern side of Building Complex II facing Street E8 is defined by Wall E7, a massive stone wall over 40 m. long that turns westwards at a slight angle in Square H44d (in the area of Room F). A former riverbed has eroded most of the southern edge of the building, and its southern wall is preserved only at the westernmost end (Wall E430). However, the plan of the building could be reconstructed by continuing the line of Wall E430 eastwards to form a corner with the southern continuation of Wall E7 in Square G44c. The northern end of the building is defined by a massive wall (Wall E478). However, as Wall E478 runs along the northern edge of the excavated area, it is unclear whether an open area, street or another building lies on its other side. Wall E478 continues westwards into Building V and then into the unexcavated area, while Wall E7 continues northwards for an additional 5 m. beyond the limits of Building Complex II. A similar phenomenon is seen in Building Complex I, where Wall El 5 also continues northwards, delimiting an open area north of the building. The walls that continue beyond the boundaries of the buildings suggest that these buildings were parts of larger insulae defined by the street system. While the eastern, southern and northern borders of Building Complex II are quite clear, its western boundary is 122</page><page sequence="141">THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRATUM E-4 Fig. 8.34.

The southern and northern outer walls of the building (Walls E430 and E478) both continue westwards to embrace Buildings IV and V, which adjoin Building Complex II from the west without any open area or street of any kind separating them. Wall E712 weakly separates Buildings II and IV on the southwest. This indistinct separation between Buildings II, IV and V results from their association within the same insula. Further north, Walls E677 and E577 are a more substantial 123</page><page sequence="142">CHAPTER 8 Fig. 8.39. Area E, Pit E140 before excavation. Fig. 8.40. Area E, Pit E140 after excavation.

It should be noted that several features now known to belong to Building Complex IV were originally associated with Building Complex II in Shďar Hagolan 1 (Garfinkel and Ben-Shlomo 2002a: 62-65), including Room B of Building Complex IV (defined there as Room 418). In the northwest, Building V is attached to Wall E562 (see Fig. 8.70). In some respects the division between Building Complex II and the western Buildings IV and V is arbitrary. However, our separation of the complexes takes into account the clear pattern of a courtyard building with a series of rooms around it. Therefore, the second row of rooms to the west, without access to the courtyard of Building Complex II, was defined as belonging to a separate building. It is possible that Fig. 8.42. Area E, Building Complex III (from the west). 124</page><page sequence="143">THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRATUM E-4 Fig. 8.43. Area E, stone concentration in Building Complex III (from the north). Fig. 8.44. Area E, Building Complex II (from the south). further excavation to the west would result in modification of our conclusions. While the entrance of Building Complex IÍ is not as clear as that of Building Complex I, the most probable location was from the southeast, through Wall E7 in Square G44b. Several large flat stones were found in a segment of the wall leading from the southern part of the main street to an open area between Rooms F and K. The width of this entrance is estimated at 1 m. A row of stones continues the northern edge of the entrance into the courtyard, parallel to Wall E237 in Square G44b, creating a small niche or an installation possibly related to the entrance, similar to Wall E71 of Building Complex I (see above). Another entrance to Building Complex II was discerned in the southwestern corner of Room R (Square J43c), where a threshold of several large, flat river pebbles marks an indirect entrance from Building V into Building Complex II. This entrance only existed in Phase E-4A and was probably secondary. Although no other entrances into Building Complex II were discerned, an entrance on the south through Room M, which has eroded away, is quite likely. It should be noted that very long segments of the building, up to 45 m., had no passage to the outside. Building Complex II is separated into 25 rooms and spaces denoted Ato X. Although initially the letters were allocated from south to north, as the excavation continued in several directions the designations were no longer indicative of the location within the building. There are six open spaces, comprising B, D, J, W and T, all of which can be combined into the central courtyard (A). The other spaces were defined as rooms. As noted above, the differences in plan between the two constructional phases are limited, usually comprising superimposed floors. In several rooms, however, architectural changes were noted. In the earlier phase, 19 rooms were defined (Table 8.2), while in the later phase alterations were made: Room H-I was separated into Rooms H and I, Rooms R1 and R2 were united as Room R, and Rooms X and Y were united as Room X-Y (Fig. 8.46). Consequently, there were only 18 rooms in the later phase. To facilitate the discussion, Building Complex II is divided into four sections: courtyards/open areas, southern-eastern, northern and western. Each of these sections has certain specific features. The southern-eastern section is characterized by a row of small square rooms, some of them paved, whose doors, when detected, open onto Courtyard A. The northern section comprises large broadrooms that may have subdivisions and 125</page><page sequence="144">CHAPTER 8 Fig. 8.45.

This area, where brick walls were better preserved, was built back to back with Building Complex IV. The architectural analysis of Building Complex II will be carried out according to the different sections, beginning with the large open areas in the center of the building. THE OPEN AREAS: COURTYARD A AND OPEN SPACE B (Plan Fig. 8.48; see also 8.57-8.58) Courtyard A This is the predominant open area in the center of Building Complex II. It is rectangular in shape and connects almost all the units of the building (Fig. 8.49). The area of Courtyard A is about 236 sq. m., comprising 46.3% of the net floor area of the building (33% of the total area including walls). Together with the associated Open Areas B, D, J, T and W, the central open area in Building Complex II reaches a total of 318 sq. m., nearly 62.5% of the floor area of Building Complex II (44.9% of total area), a higher percentage of floor area than that of Building Complex I (60.5%).

Courtyard A, over 25 m. long, will be described from south to north (see Table 8.3). The southern part of Courtyard A faces Rooms K and L and the main entrance to the building from the east (see plans Figs. 8.57-8.58). Wall E341 in Square G43b is a north-south wall partially separating Courtyard A from Open Area W to the west. To the east of Wall E341, a paved area measuring 3.2 x 1 .55 m. was revealed, which slopes downward to the south and has two constructional phases. In the lower phase (E-4B) the pavement is of large, flat river pebbles (E349, Fig. 8.45, center right), while in the upper phase (E-4 A) the pavement is of smaller angular stones (E311). This was probably a storage facility in the courtyard. The area south of this installation up to Room L is rich in small stones, which may indicate that it was also paved at some time, doubling the storage area. In the southeastern corner of the courtyard are several pits: Pits E202 and E222 in Square G44a, and Pit E212 in Square G44d , which contained many rounded stones . Another concentration of stones is in Square G44a (E219). Table 8.3. Area E, Building Complex II, the various elements in the courtyard.

Area E, Pavement E733 in the courtyard of Building Complex II. North of Wall E5, several pavements, representing two phases, are located in Square H44a. The lower phase (E-4B) is characterized by a pavement of small angular stones (E21) and, to its north, a massive pavement of large, flat river pebbles (E733; Figs. 8.54-8.55). Above this, in Phase E-4A, two areas are paved with large river pebbles: Pavement El 3 in the east (see Fig. 3.31) has an elongated shape, while Pavement E30 has a more rounded shape. A line of stones (E36) standing on their narrow end, running south for 1.5 m., is connected to Pavement E30 (Fig. 8.55). The different shapes of the paved areas may possibly be related to their function. The central part of Courtyard A in Square I44a-c is richer in features, including rounded pits (such as E265, Fig. 8.49) and several large, flat river pebbles (E230, see Fig. 3.32) that probably form part of a Phase E-4A pavement, similar to El 3. It should be noted that some of the outer stones are standing 130</page><page sequence="149">THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRATUM E-4 on their narrow end. Pit E281 is located in the southern part of Square I44a and a beaten-earth floor (E252) was detected nearby. North of Pavement E230, a rounded shallow pit surrounded by a circle of angular stones is probably a hearth (E266). Adjacent to Wall E272 of Room H, a rectangular section of a mud-plaster floor (E267), measuring 1.3 x 0.7 m. was preserved (see Fig. 3.36). Other mud-plaster floors were found in Square J43b (E503) and in J43d (E529 with pottery, Fig. 8.56). In Square J43d, Floor E509 is a mud-plaster floor fragment associated with the upper phase (E-4 A), as a debris layer was found below it. A circle of large stones in Square I44a with a diameter of 1 m. may be another hearth (E335). In the same square, a large basalt mortar was sunk into the floor (E726, Fig. 8.53) and a nearby concentration of stones, some of them mud plastered, may have been a hearth (E727, Fig. 8.53). Slightly to the south is a patch of pavement made of sparsely arranged, rounded pebbles (E728). Fig. 8.55. Area E, Pavement E30 in the courtyard of Building Complex II after removal of its upper phase and exposure of the lower pavement. Fig. 8.56. Area E, a pottery vessel on Floor E529 in the courtyard of Building Complex II. On the eastern side of Square I44a, partly in Open Area J, a larger area is paved with sparsely arranged, rounded and angular pebbles (E326), and a concentration of angular and rounded stones was found in Square I43d (E736). In the same square, a fragmentary wall (Wall E506) adjoins Wall E425 of Room S (see Fig. 8.92). A larger, rounded concentration of stones lies near the northeastern corner of Courtyard A in Square J44c (E493) and is most probably a pit dug from the level of Floor E490 in Open Area J (see below). THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS OF BUILDING COMPLEX II (Plans Figs. 8.48, 8.57-8.58) The southern section of Building Complex II consists of four rooms (K, L, M and N) adjacent to the building's southern wall. Similarly, the eastern part of the building consists of a row of six or seven rooms adjacent to the building's eastern wall (F, C, E, G, H-I and O) and three open areas, B , D and J. All discernible entrances to these rooms are from Courtyard A. The pairing of rooms noted in Building Complex I is apparent to some extent in this section of Building Complex II, for example Room G with a stone pavement adjacent to Room H-I with a beaten-earth floor. However, although Room G has no entrance (as would be expected), no entrance was discerned for Room H-I either. A similar phenomenon can be seen in Rooms K (paved) and L (unpaved, a possible entrance to the courtyard), and Room F, which is divided into paved and unpaved areas, similar to Room E of Building Complex I. Only the northern parts of the four southern rooms, K, L, M and N, are preserved (Figs. 8.59-8.60), as the topography in this area slopes sharply southward towards the river. Nevertheless, these rooms have been reconstructed as rectangular in shape, and their sizes and areas calculated (see Table 8.2). Room N This is the best preserved of the four southern rooms, located in the southwestern corner of Building Complex II, adjacent to Building Complex IV. The room is delineated by Walls E430 on the south, E358 on the west, E382 on the north and E371A on the east. Walls E358 and E382 separate Building Complex II from Courtyard A of Building Complex IV. Only a few stones of the southern wall and part of the eastern wall are preserved. The room has a beaten-earth floor. The entrance may have been located in the eastern wall, creating a passage into Unit M. A circle of stones, possibly a hearth, was found in the room (E383). Room M This space between Rooms N and L may be either a room or an open area, as only the northern edges of Walls E371a and E286 were preserved. Several stones in an east- west orientation (E3 1 7) may have been remains of a northern closing wall. Three large flat stones creating a U-shaped installation, facing north, are located in the northeastern corner of Room M (E412), and may also have been remains of a northern wall. In any case, there was a passage from Room M to Open Area W, and possibly also to Rooms N and L. One may also suggest 131</page><page sequence="150">CHAPTER 8 Fig. 8.57. Area E, plan of the southern section of Building Complex II, Phase E-4B. that a main entrance to the building was located in this area. The floor seems to have been of beaten earth. Room L This room, east of Room M and preserved only in its northern part, is delineated by Walls E286 on the west, E379 on the north and E293 on the east. Wall E379 is well preserved; it is possibly reached by two levels of stone pavements from the north in Courtyard A (Pavements E311 and E349), and thus is apparently contemporary with both phases. Since no entrance to the room was discerned in the northern wall the entrance was possibly in the western wall, from Open Area W through Room M. The eastern wall of Room L (E293), also partially eroded, separates it from Room K. The preserved area of this room apparently has a beaten-earth floor that declines sharply southwards about 0.40 m . Room K This room was eroded by the Yarmuk River on its southern and eastern sides. The room is delineated by Walls E293 on the west and E239 on the north. On the eastern side of Square G43d a modern fill had accumulated on the sloping edge of the area (E276, Stratum E-l). Because of this fill, the northern wall of Room K was better preserved and apparently adjoins Wall E7, although the corner is not preserved. Though an entrance was possibly located near this corner, it is possible that this paved room had no entrance from the courtyard but was accessed through Room L. Part of a stone pavement, which may have covered the entire room, was found in the northwestern part of Room K. The lower level of this pavement was only partly unearthed (E361, Phase E-4B), as the upper level (E226, Phase E-4A) was not dismantled. Both pavements are constructed of large, flat, densely packed river pebbles. Room F This is the southernmost and largest room of the eastern section of Building Complex II (Fig. 8.61), which comprises 132 ° o Iä«.

Room F is delineated by Walls E237 on the south, E6 on the west, E12 on the north and E7 on the east. Walls E6 and E237 are not completely preserved and only one stone survives at their point of intersection. The entrance to the room was probably near this corner. Wall E6 continues north to Room C. Room F is divided into a northern paved area (Pavement E77, see Fig. 3.30) and a southern part with a beaten-earth floor. The pavement, of which an area of 2.7 x 1.1 m. is preserved, is made of large, flat river pebbles. Several large rounded stones outline the southern edge of the pavement. The entrance to the room is in the unpaved part, similar to Room E in Building Complex I, which is also divided into paved and unpaved sections. Room C This is a narrow rectangular room (Fig. 8.62; see also Fig. 3.24) delineated by Walls El 2 on the south, E6 on the west, Ell on the north and E7 on the east. No entrance was identified. The floor surface is of beaten earth with a fragmentary installation upon it made of several flat stones (E9a), possibly a hearth. Open Area D This area between Rooms C and E was open, as there is no western wall to this space and it faces the pavements in Courtyard A (E13 and E21), which continue into it. Like Open Area B, it contains a "grinding corner". In the northwestern corner, a fragment of the stone wall (E4) that separates Area D from Room E was preserved. The southern part is partly paved with large, flat river pebbles (Pavement E 14). Just north of the pavement, an installation comprising a basalt mortar encircled by small rounded pebbles and sunk below the floor level was found (E24, see Fig. 8.51, also Fig. 3.41). This mortar was stolen from the site and its current location is unknown.

Wall E43, which continues to Rooms G and H-I (its northern part denoted as Wall E272), is preserved only in the northwestern corner of the room and in the southwestern corner where it meets Wall E4 (this is partly because the 1989 test trench was initially made at this spot). An entrance from Courtyard A could have been located in one of these walls, most likely in the western one. To the north, Wall E324 is preserved to its mudbrick superstructure and separates Room E from Room G. A paved area measuring 1 .45 x 1 .1 m., made of exceptionally large, flat river pebbles, was uncovered in the center of Room E (E40, Fig. 8.64). Based on the elevations, it seems that this pavement belongs to the upper Phase E-4A, while the debris in the room is mostly of Phase E-4B. The pavement is made of large, flat river pebbles and smaller round ones. Room G This is a small rectangular room delineated by Walls E324 on the south, E43 on the west, E228 on the north and E7 on the east. Although the foundations of all its walls are fully preserved, no entrance was discerned. The entire room is paved with densely packed, medium-sized, rounded and angular pebbles (E346, Figs. 8.65-8.66). In several patches, especially near the walls, rounded mudbricks were laid on the pavement, probably forming an integral part of it. A concentration of bones and ash in the room is interpreted as a hearth (E344). A pit dug into Pavement E346 contained a burial of a skull and several long bones (E306). The occurrence of a burial in a small paved room is unusual. Room H-I This is the area between Room G in the south and Open Area J in the north. In the earlier phase (E-4B) it was a single rectangular room bounded by Wall E228 on the south, Wall E251 separating it from Open Area J on the north, the relatively well-preserved Wall E272 on the west, and on the east by Wall E7, the outer wall of Building Complex II, which is thickened at this spot to a width of 1 .2 m. in Square I44b. Nevertheless, no entrance from the courtyard through this wall was discerned. The floor of Room H-I seems to be of beaten earth, although several stones in the western part may be the remains of a pavement (E253, Fig. 8.67-8.68). In the later phase (E-4A) this room was divided by Wall E254 134</page><page sequence="153">THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRATUM E-4 Fig. 8.60.

Open Area J This space, north of Room H-I and south of Room O (Fig. 8.69), is most probably an open area, as it is completely open to Courtyard A on its western side, to a length of over 5 m. Open Area J is defined by Wall E251 on the south and Wall E464 on the north. A large pit of irregular shape (E264), measuring 1 .7 x 1 .0 m., was excavated to a depth of about 0.50 m. in Square I44a.

THE NORTHERN SECTION OF BUILDING COMPLEX II (Plans Figs. 8.70-8.71) This section is dominated by two large broadrooms, Rooms Q and R, arranged in an L shape.

It should be emphasized, nevertheless, that the outer walls of Building Complex II remain unchanged, although possibly renovated, and the floor levels of the two phases all relate to the same walls. Room O This room, north of Open Area J and abutting Room Q from the south, is defined by Walls E464 on the south, E502 on the west, E442 on the north and E7 on the east. Wall E442 is a massive east-west wall separating the eastern and northern sections of Building Complex II. The western (E502) and southern (E464) walls of Room O are relatively well-preserved. The entrance to the room, 0.50 m. wide, was through Wall E464 in the southeastern corner of the room. In the southwestern corner was a rounded patch of mud- and lime-plaster floor (E433), or part of a plastered installation similar to those in Area G (e .g . , Installation G23) . Rooms Q and R in Phase E-4B Room Q is the largest room in Building Complex II, and in all of Area E (Figs. 8.72-8.73). It is delineated by Walls E442 on the south, E563/E526 on the west, E478 on the north and E524/E525 on the east. Its southeastern corner is defined as a different space (Room P), although these two rooms can be viewed as a single rectangular unit with an area of ca. 44 sq. m. Room Q lies between two massive east- west walls: Wall E478 on the north, the northern wall of Buildings II and V, and Wall E442 on the south, facing Courtyard A. On the east, Wall E7 is the outer wall of Building Complex II and Walls E524 and E525 separate Room Q from Room P. On the west, Wall E526 separates Room Q from Room R. The corner of Wall E563 with Wall E442 seems to run under Wall E526 (Fig. 8.74). As Wall E526 was not dismantled, Wall E563 was not fully excavated and its width is uncertain. Since the northern part of the wall was not preserved, it does not reach Wall E478, probably due to the fact that Pit E617 of Phase E-4 A penetrated this area. Moreover, a passage was possibly located in this area between Rooms Q and R. Wall E563 can be interpreted as a double wall or reinforcement of Wall E526 that exists only in Phase E-4B and was cancelled by Floor E572 in Phase E-4 A. No clear entrance was discerned from Courtyard A into Room Q, but several flatter stones in the western part of Wall E442 may be interpreted as the remains of a threshold; Room Q should therefore be viewed as a typical broadroom. In Phase E-4B, Room Q is divided by a partial wall (Wall E651), 0.60 m. thick, that adjoins Wall E478 and extends about 1.6 m southwards. The southern part of Wall E651 is 137</page><page sequence="156">CHAPTER 8 PQ i W d) (/5 a £ i- T l-H X Ü E o U bû .g 2 '3 PQ M-h o c o &lt;L&gt; CZJ E &lt;ü € O tí &lt;D X M-( O U W CÖ a &lt; o 00 b¿&gt; řr 138 ^f" */• - °"o o0 lAaaJL-r^^ì/^@^ ?Q ° ° f^? ^ ~ £&amp;$ *-1- fe* * 0 @ ~ ZOSM ^ 5 ¿§sp f í^?n ¿ |il^.p E ^ í^?n ~ ¿ " Pio I I sā^"'^^'ļgnrt&gt;e%aMi?Vļukj-t) - I -Ķ^i. :■%■■. i "+ v "- ffî- ,§&amp; ' ' IļļTfl Ķ*^$ . &lt;=¿£0° o^ •. ^grcro^o ¿ ; ° O s !

The part of Room Q to the east of Wall E65 1 is about twice as large as the western part, and a relatively large area paved with small and medium-sized, angular stones and pebbles was exposed (E552, Fig. 8.73; see also Fig. 3.6). These pebbles could be the foundation of a mud-plaster floor that is not preserved. A mud-plaster floor level below the pebble pavement (E553) probably represents an even earlier phase of the room, which may be denoted Phase E-4C. This third phase is rarely seen elsewhere in the building. Other patches of beaten-earth floor are discerned in Locus E641 and to the west of Wall E651 (Floor E602). A pebble figurine (Fig. 8.75; see also Fig. 1.12) and restorable fragments of a clay figurine (Fig. 8.76; see also Fig. 1.13 left) were found in Room Q. 140</page><page sequence="159">THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRATUM E-4 Fig. 8.75. Area E, a pebble figurine and a bone on the floor of Room Q in Building Complex II. Fig. 8.77. Area E, Room R of Building Complex II with Pithos E668 in the northeastern corner of the room. Fig. 8.76. Area E, fragments of a clay figurine on the floor of Room Q of Building Complex II. It is notable that the largest room in the building is located at the northern end of the building, facing the courtyard and the entrance. The same configuration occurs in Building Complex I (Room C). It can be suggested that the head of the extended family or clan occupied this room, located in a strategic position for controlling the main courtyard and the entrance to the building. Room P, located inside Room Q in the southeastern corner, is rounded in shape (Fig. 8.72; see also Fig. 3.6) and delineated by Walls E442 on the south, E524 on the west, E525 on the north and E7 on the east. Walls E524 and E525 are thinner walls separating Rooms Q and P, and meet at an obtuse angle. These thin, adjoining walls are not well preserved, and for some reason were built one on top of the other. Near the northeastern corner of Room P, several flat stones may be the remains of a pavement (E458). No passage was discerned between Rooms Q and P, probably indicating that Room P was a storage facility. Room R is situated in the northwestern corner of Building Complex II (Fig. 8.77; see also Fig. 3.22), adjoining Room Q at a right angle and creating an L-shaped unit. The room is delineated by Walls E535 on the south, E562 on the west, E683 on the north and E526/E563 on the east. As noted above, the western side of the Phase E-4B wall (E563) between Rooms Q and R was not exposed, but a passage between the rooms in the northern part is most likely in both Phases E-4A and E-4B. Thus, the width of Room R may be estimated as 4.5 m., or possibly less if Wall E563 was not completely straight. The southern wall of Room R (Wall E535) was not excavated to its base and the exposed remains consist mainly of its mudbrick superstructure. This wall does not seem to change between Phases E4-B and E-4A and also appears to be the northern wall of Room S. The western and northern walls of Room R, which are also the outer walls of Building Complex II, reveal a lower constructional phase (E-4B). The southern part of Wall E562 lies below Wall E606, with a distinct layer of brick material, 0.15 m.thick, in between. There is no passage from Building V to Room R in this phase. A similar phenomenon is noticed in the northern wall of Room R, which is the northern wall of Building Complex II (a continuation of Wall E478 in Room Q), where Wall E683 lies below Wall E478 with a layer of several cm of brick material between them. In Phase E-4B , Room R is separated by Wall E684 into two 141</page><page sequence="160">CHAPTER 8 Fig. 8.78. Area E, plan of Room R2 of Building Complex II.

Room R2 (Fig. 8.78), the smaller northern room, has an exceptionally well-preserved beaten-earth floor on which an assemblage of installations and stone and pottery vessels was exposed in situ (Floor E594, Figs. 8.78-8.87). The debris above the floor contained several large grinding stones, turned upside-down. On the floor itself, a complete stone bowl was found together with a whetstone and several flat slabs , probably used as anvils. In the southwestern corner of the room, a hearth was constructed from rounded stones, with a holemouth jar smashed upon it (Figs. 8.81-8.82). A large ceramic pithos was placed in a pit dug from the floor level in the northeastern Fig. 8.80.

Since the uppermost part of the pithos is not preserved, it was discerned only at a slightly lower level, after the other remains in Room R2 were removed. A similar pithos sunk into a corner of a room was found in Area H (see Figs. 11.41-11.42; Garfinkel and Miller 2002: 28, Fig. 2.26; Garfinkel 2002a: 90-91). Room R2 is interpreted as a cooking and food processing area, a kitchen preserved in situ with most of the elements in their original location. Below Floor E594, a 143</page><page sequence="162">CHAPTER 8 Fig. 8.87. Area E, Room R2 of Building Complex II, close-up of the northeastern corner with the large pithos. debris level was reached, possibly representing a Phase E-4C in the room, as discerned in Room Q. Room R1 is the larger southern part of Room R. It was almost devoid of finds, indicative of a distinct difference in the function of these two spaces. While Room R2 was the food processing area, Room R1 was probably the living quarters. The floor level in Room R1 was difficult to identify, while the debris (E604) is ca. 0.20 m. thick. Rooms Q and R in Phase E-4A The upper phase of Rooms Q and R is characterized by the cancellation of some of the partitions. Room Q may be slightly larger in this phase, as Wall E526 is situated about 0.50 m. to the west of Wall E563. All the other outer walls of Room Q remain the same in Phase E-4A, probably including the passage to Courtyard A (E442) in the southern wall. Although Wall E442 runs below Wall E526 of Phase E-4A at its western end, it must have had a similar upper phase adjoining Wall E526 that is not preserved, based on the circular stratigraphy attained in this room: Wall E526 adjoins Wall E478 in the north, which adjoins Wall E7, which is adjoined by Wall E525/E524, which in turn adjoins Wall E442. Room P remains unchanged in both phases. In Room Q, a single row of stones (E570) may be a partition wall or part of an installation. About 0.50 m . to the east, a concentration of rounded pebbles (E633) may also be a fragment of a wall or an installation. In any case, these features are less substantial than Wall E651 of Phase E-4B, and therefore do not create a distinct partition within Room Q. In the western part of the room is Floor E572, a fragmentary floor foundation made of angular pebbles. In the northwestern corner, a rounded concentration of stones (E617) is probably a shallow pit dug from Floor E572 that cuts the northern part of Phase E-4B Wall E563. In the eastern part of Room Q, a fragmentary floor appearing as patches of densely packed, small and medium-sized rounded pebbles was revealed (E618). Room R in Phase E-4A was a single rectangular space without partitions, its inner measurements 7.5 x 3.8 m., with a floor area of 27 sq. m. The room might have been somewhat smaller in width as Phase E-4A Wall E526 is situated about 0.50 m. to the west of Phase E-4B Wall E563. This wall, which is clearly above Wall E563 in its northern half, slopes down towards the south. Consequently, the upper phase of the wall in the southeastern corner of Room R is not well preserved, and it cannot be ruled out that there was an entrance from Courtyard A at this spot, as there is no other possible location for it. The northern part of the western wall of Room R (Wall E562) continues to exist without modification, but its southern part lies below Wall E606. The main feature in this phase is a rectangular threshold made of six large, flat river pebbles, situated near the southern corner of Wall E606 (E534). It lies on a 0.20-m-thick layer of brick material, but its perfect alignment with Wall E606 ascertains its identification as a threshold in an upper phase of the wall. This threshold represents a passage from Building V into Room R of Building Complex II, implying that these buildings were not distinctly separate in this stage. The floor of Room R is unclear, probably of beaten earth. An interesting feature of Rooms Q and R, as well as Rooms X and Y (see below), is that the later constructional phase is characterized by larger units with fewer partitions. THE WESTERN SECTION OF BUILDING COMPLEX II (Plans Figs. 8.88-8.89; see also Figs. 8.57-8.58) The western section (Fig. 8.90) is not as easily defined architecturally as the other sections of the building; the borders between Buildings IV and V and the western side of Building Complex II are less formal, as all these buildings belong to the same insula. The western section can be roughly divided into two parts: in the north, Room S facing Courtyard A and Rooms U and V facing Open Area T; in the south, Rooms X and Y facing Open Area W. As in the northern section of Building Complex II, a number of changes were made in the rooms between Phases E-4B and E4-A. Phase E-4B Room S is a relatively large broadroom similar to Rooms Q and R, adjoining Room R from the south (Figs. 8.91-8.92). It is delineated by Walls E350 on the south, E350a on the west, E535 on the north and E425 on the east. Most of the northern part of this room is disrupted by MB I Disturbance E636, and the northern part of the western wall is not preserved. A line of stones in Square I43a (E556) may be the remnants of such a wall, although this would form a diagonal line between Rooms S and U. In the southern part, several bricks were exposed from Wall E350a, separating Room S from Room U. This wall forms a distinct corner with Wall E350, the southern wall facing Open Area T. The eastern wall of Room S (Wall E425), facing Courtyard A, was best preserved in Square I43d, while to the north in Square I43b only a single fragmentary line of stones remains from this wall. The entrance into Room S is not preserved, and may have been located in the northern part of Wall E425, where a large flat stone was found, and thus the entrance was from Courtyard A. The area to the north of this point is damaged by the MB I disturbance. In most cases, since the floor level of Room S was not reached and only the uppermost levels of the walls were exposed, the elements within the room should be assigned to Phase E-4A. In the southern part of the room, a small posthole 144</page><page sequence="163">Fig. 8.88.

Area E, the western section of Building Complex II (from the south). was detected in Phase E4-A. It probably also existed in Phase E-4B as well (E537; Fig. 8.93; see also Fig. 4.36). Room U is a very poorly preserved square room, west of Room S and bordering Building V from the east (Fig. 8.94). The room is delineated by Walls E613 on the south, E539 on the west, E549 on the north and E350a on the east. Most of the elements excavated in Room U belong to Phase E-4 A. From the earlier Phase E-4B, a diagonal row of stones (E666), about 2 m. long, runs below the stones of Wall E549 and possibly adjoins Wall E350a. If this were the northern wall of the earlier phase, it would create a larger room than that of Phase E-4 A. However, these stones may also be a feature belonging to Building V. The lower part of the southern wall of Room U (Wall E61) also belongs to Phase E-4B, although it does not change in Phase E-4 A. Debris E629 is the level relating to Phase E-4B in Room U, beneath Floor E622 of Phase E-4 A (Fig. 8.95). Room V is a rectangular room bordering Building Complex IV from the east (Fig. 8.94) and hence is the westernmost room of Building Complex II. This room, together with Room U, creates a distinct western protrusion in the complex's plan; however, as Room V faces the central open area of the building, it is included in Building Complex II rather than Building Complex IV. It is possible that Room V is a somewhat later addition to the building. The room is delineated by Walls E577 on the west, E613 on the north and E648 on the east. In most cases, only the upper phase of Wall E577 was excavated, but lower stones discerned below a fill layer belong to a Phase E-4B stage of this wall. The eastern wall of the room, facing Courtyard A (Wall E648), was excavated and is a relatively thick stone wall. However, as mentioned above, the northern wall of Room V (E613) is unclear in its lower phase. In the south, Room V borders on Rooms B and C of Building Complex IV, although the separating wall is not preserved. This wall can be reconstructed as a westward continuation of Wall E357. The entrance into the room was not discerned, but since in the upper phase it was identified near the northeastern corner of the room, it is reasonable that there was an entrance from Courtyard A in Phase E-4B as well. Thus, this was another broadroom facing onto the main courtyard. The floor in Room V is paved partly with mud plaster and partly with medium-sized angular pebbles (Floor E645). Several bricks scattered on the floor may be the remains of a brick installation. The floor reaches Wall E613 in certain places. Open Area T is the space defined by Wall E350 of Rooms U and S on the north, by Wall E648 of Room V on the west, and by Wall E357 on the south. It is, in fact, a western part of Courtyard A. The only feature noted in this area is a rounded pit filled with stones in Square I43c (E428). 147</page><page sequence="166">CHAPTER 8 Fig. 8.91 .

Area E, Posthole E537 in RoomS of Building Complex II (from the west). Wall E357 is an east-west stone wall, 1 m. thick, separating Rooms X and Y from Open Area T and continuing to the west as the northern wall of Room B in Building Complex IV. The wall was used continuously in both Phases E-4B and E-4A. It is interpreted as the division wall between Building Complexes II and IV. Rooms X and Y face Open Area W, as Rooms U and V face Open Area T. Room X is a rectangular room south of Wall E357 (Fig. 8.96). The room is delineated by Walls E374 on the south, E415 on the west, E357 on the north and E411 on the east. Only the tops of the walls of this room were excavated. In the east, Wall E411 is a long brick wall continuing south into Open Area W and creating, with Wall E300, another defined space south of Room X. Wall E415 is a narrow 148</page><page sequence="167">THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRATUM E-4 Fig. 8.94. Area E, Rooms U and V of Building Complex II (from the southeast). Fig. 8.95. Area E, close-up of the floor of Room U of Building Complex II (from the south). brick wall, 0.40 m. thick, between Rooms X and Y, forming a corner with the southern wall (E374). The entrance to the room from Open Area W, in the southeastern corner, is ca. 0.80 m. wide. The floor level of the room was not reached. A rounded installation, 1 .4 m. in diameter, was excavated in the middle of the room (E400, Fig. 8.97). It is comprised of a brick wall 0.30 m. thick, supported by stones on its eastern side, and an inner part, ca. 1 m. in diameter, containing a soft fill with few finds. The nature of this installation is unclear. Room Y is a very narrow, rectangular room west of Room X (Fig. 8.96), delineated by Walls E416 on the west, E357 on the north and E415 on the east. Wall E416 is a relatively narrow wall separating Room Y from Room B of Building Complex IV. Several stones on the southern edge of the room are possibly the remains of a southern wall; the entrance into Room Y was most probably through this wall from Open Area W. As in Room X, the floor levels and lower levels of the walls were not reached. Open Area W is the space defined by Rooms X and Y on the north, Wall E712 (and Building Complex IV) on the west and Rooms N and M on the south. Like Open Area T, it can be defined as a part of the main Courtyard A. Most elements in this area show no change between Phases E-4B and E-4B. Open Area W is partially divided into northern and southern sections by Wall E300, a relatively thick (0.80 m.) wall about 1.5 m. long. Stones E403 and E427 in Square G43b, which may be related to the wall from the south, create a straight line, possibly an eastern boundary wall of Open Area W. The southern part of Open Area W is particularly rich in features, including a section of pavement made of small, densely arranged pebbles in Square H43c (E319), an earlier phase of Pavement E353 above it. In the southwestern corner of Square 149</page><page sequence="168">CHAPTER 8 Fig. 8.96. Area E, Rooms X and Y of Building Complex II and Room B of Building Complex IV (from the south). Fig. 8.97. Area E, Room X of Building Complex II (from the south), Pit E400 in the center and Grinding Stone E386 above Wall E415 on the left. G43a was a patch of mud-plaster floor (E322), on which was a grinding stone (E318). The rest of Open Area W had a beaten- earth floor. In the northern part of Open Area W, only one feature was found: a large basalt mortar sunk into the floor and encircled with stones (E372, which continues into Phase E-4A). Phase E-4A Room S includes several features at elevations defined as Phase E-4A. In the southern part of the room is a posthole for a roof-supporting pillar comprising a circle of small flat stones, about 0.30 m. in diameter (E537, Fig. 8.92; see also Fig. 3.37), located on the central longitudinal axis of the room. Pit E378, probably a poorly preserved burial of the later Stratum E-l (see Chapter 7), cut the southeastern part of Room S. Room U contains mainly elements assigned to Phase E-4A. The MB I Disturbance E636 cut through the western half of the northern wall (E549) and the northern edge of Wall E539 that separates Room U from Building V. The southern wall of Room U is made up of a section of Wall E613 that continues from Phase E-4B and a western section denoted Wall E546, comprising the northern wall of Room V and added only in Phase E-4A. The entrance into Room U from Open Area T was from its southern side, where two large flat stones were probably a threshold. South of the threshold, an area of ca. 0.90 X 0.70 m. was paved with small pebbles. In the eastern part of Room U, a rectangular area measuring 1 .9 X 1 m. and paved with rounded and angular medium-sized pebbles (E548), reaches Wall E350a on the east. Some of the larger stones found in this area may have fallen from Wall E350a. The room's floor is largely of beaten earth, apart from a segment of mud-plaster surface (Floor E622) with nearly 150</page><page sequence="169">THE ARCHITECTURE OF STRATUM E-4 complete broken vessels lying upon it. In the middle of Room U, on Floor E622, is another posthole comprising a circle of five rounded flat stones, about 0.40 m. in diameter, similar to the one in Room S. To the west of this feature, a small rounded pit contained large fragments of a holemouth jar (E674). Room V is not modified in Phase E-4 A. Several large flat stones in the northern part of Wall E648 form the threshold of an entrance into the room from Courtyard A (E620). Since these stones are higher than most of the stones of the wall, they are related only to the upper Phase E-4 A. The floor is not well preserved and only patches of mud plaster were found (E591). A fill 0.15 m. thick was excavated between the Phase E-4B and E-4A floor levels (Fill E609). Wall E648 is partly covered by a mud-plaster surface, and hence the eastern wall of the room was narrower in Phase E-4 A. A row of five stones perpendicular to Wall E577 (E577a) may be the remains of a partition wall inside the room, or an installation. Open Area T in this phase includes a line of four stones (Wall E600) perpendicular to Wall E648 from the east. These stones are higher than the stones of Wall E648 and were added later, adjoining the upper wall (which was not preserved). Otherwise, this area does not change in Stratum E-4 A. Room. X- Y replaces Rooms X and Y of Phase E-4B, constituting the main change in this unit in Phase E-4 A. An installation comprising a basalt grinding stone encircled with small pebbles was found lying on the bricks of Wall E415 (E386), thus canceling it. Consequently, in Phase E-4A Rooms X and Y were combined into a square unit measuring 3.5 x 3.2 m., with a floor area of ca. 14.5 sq. m. (assuming that the southern Wall E374 was not canceled). Open Area W undergoes little modification in this phase. Wall E300 and Stones E403 continue to exist, as does Mortar E372. A patch of floor covering debris of Phase E-4B was found in Square H43d (E713). Pavement E353 lying above Pavement E319 in Square H43c is likewise made of small pebbles but covers a smaller area and is rectangular in shape. In the southern part, Floor E322, Grinding Stone E318 and Stones E698 continue to exist. In this phase, near Floor E322, a pit contained a poorly preserved human burial consisting only of fragments of a skull and long bones (E3 16). Adjoining Wall E382 of Room N from the courtyard side is Installation E384, a semicircular line of stones. The area near the installation was rich in finds such as pottery, flint, animal bones and a stone figurine. This installation was apparently added at some time after the construction of Wall E382. THE AREA NORTH OF BUILDING COMPLEX II (Plans Figs. 8.70-8.71) Only a small area was excavated to the north of Building Complex II in Square K44c. The eastern wall of Building Complex II, Wall E7, continues northwards at least 4 m., where it is denoted Wall E482 (see Fig. 8.72). Several other fragmentary walls were exposed in this area as well. To the north of Wall E478, in Phase E-4B, a rectangular pavement of large flat pebbles measuring 2 x 1 .5 m. (Pavement E480) extends between parallel Walls E482 and E476 and Wall 478. This space was either a room in another building or a feature within an open area, as there is no northern closing wall. The upper phase (E-4 A) was only fragmentarily preserved. Wall E481 lies above Wall E482, while Wall E475 lies above and slightly to the east of Wall E476. A short wall fragment at the northern edge of Square K44c is possibly an upper phase continuation of Walls E482/E481 (Wall E487). Several flat stones (E477) may be remains of a higher pavement lying above Pavement E480. This area could have been a storage facility. As the edge of the excavated area lies at the northern limits of Building Complex II, it is unclear whether there was a wide open area, or even an east-west cross-street, somewhat further to the north of this large building (meeting the north-south Street E8), or perhaps another building immediately adjoining it. BUILDING COMPLEX IV (Plan Fig. 8.98) Building Complex IV is situated to the southwest of Building Complex II (Fig. 8.99; see also Fig. 8.45) and is closely connected with it, as the western partition wall between the two buildings (Wall E712) is very thin, the southern wall of Building Complex IV (Wall E642) is the continuation of Wall E430 of Building Complex II, and its northern wall (E357) is also common to both buildings. Wall E416, also relatively narrow, separates Room Y of Building Complex II from Room B of Building Complex IV. It is possible that at some stage parts of these buildings were united. Building Complex IV was partially excavated over an area of ca. 130 sq. m., and its size and shape are unknown. No entrance to the building was revealed. Nevertheless, according to the limited remains uncovered, it appears to be a courtyard building. The large open area, Courtyard A, has at least three rooms or units facing it from the north (B, C and D; Table 8.4). As in Building Complex II, some areas exhibited two local phases of construction or occupation, denoted E-4B and E-4 A. Table 8.4. Area E, Building Complex IV, basic data on the architectural spaces.

Area E, aerial view of Building Complex IV. Courtyard A This space, comprising about 60% of the excavated area of Building Complex IV, is a large open area with a number of features, similar to the main courtyards of Buildings I and II. The floor of the courtyard is mainly of beaten earth, although several areas are paved with stones. In the southern part of the courtyard, in Square G42b, an area was paved with small pebbles, some burnt (E673). Above this pavement, a higher Phase E-4 A floor was found, also paved with small stones (E650). In Square H42d to the north, Floor E695, made of mud plaster and small pebbles, is probably a continuation of Floor E650. In Square G42b two installations can be associated with the higher floor: Installation E662, an oval concentration of stone that is probably a hearth as some of the stones are burnt, and Installation E667, comprising three large basalt stones and a mudbrick surrounding a patch of mud plaster, possibly similar to Installation E433 in Room O of Building Complex II. In the eastern part of Courtyard A, Square G43a, a row of stones comprising an oval shape ca. 1 m. in diameter was found (E315, see Fig. 3.27). The shape is incomplete on its western side. This was possibly a hearth or an installation of some other kind. Several additional elements were excavated to the north, including two small rounded pits (E314 and E380) in Squares H42d-H43c. A line of stones (E715) in Square H42d, 1.8 m. long adjacent and parallel to Wall E370, may have fallen from the wall. Stones E352 near Wall E370 may be related to the entrance to Room B. Below the Phase E-4A debris layer, near Stones E715, is a rounded concentration of stones (E722, see Fig. 3.39), and a similar concentration is situated about 2 m. to the west; these are probably hearths (E723, see Fig. 3.38). About 1 .5 m. to the south, a rounded installation made of burnt bricks and stones attributed to Phase 4B had a holemouth jar upon it (E694), and can be interpreted as a hearth or stove with the cooking vessel found in situ. Room B This rectangular room, the most complete space excavated in Building Complex IV, is delineated by Walls E370 on the south, E677 on the west, E357 on the north and E416 on the east. The entrance from Courtyard A was near the southwestern corner of the room, where several large flat stones are probably the remains of a threshold. This room, a typical broadroom, is only well defined in Phase E-4 A, as the lower Phase E-4B was reached in very limited areas. In Phase E-4B , an east- west wall (Wall E690) running under Wall E677 divided Room B into two units. Only the upper part of this wall was excavated. In Phase E-4 A, a floor segment measuring 1 .6 x 1 m. was excavated in the southeastern part of the room (E385). This floor, paved with small pebbles, was very rich in finds, including stone weights and animal bones. 153</page><page sequence="172">CHAPTER 8 To the north of this floor, a large shallow rounded pit was filled with stones (E401). Room C This narrow, rectangular room lies to the west of Room B. Only the eastern wall was preserved (Wall E677), and thus the room's shape and size are only tentatively reconstructed. The northern wall is not preserved, but it is assumed to be a continuation of Wall E357 to the west. The eastern wall was partly preserved (Wall E699), and in its southern part several large flat stones may indicate a threshold. The southern wall has not survived, and no architectural elements or floor levels were noted during excavation of this room. Open Area D This space is located to the west and north oř Room C, on the edge of the excavated area. It was only very partially excavated and was probably an open area. On the northern edge of this area, in Square I42a, several mudbricks are reconstructed as an east-west wall separating Building IV from Building V in the north (Wall E596) that was cut by MB I Disturbance E636. These bricks connect to stones possibly abutting Wall E577 of Room V in Building Complex II. In Square I42c, a floor level and a pebble foundation were revealed (E592). Above these, a line of stones oriented north-south is a wall fragment belonging to Phase E-4A (Wall E575). To the west of this wall, a floor level paved with scattered pebbles (E576) also belongs to the upper Phase E-4A. It is evident from these partial remains that Building Complex IV also represents the familiar plan of broadrooms facing a large courtyard. BUILDING COMPLEX V (Plan Fig. 8.100) Building V, situated to the northwest of Building Complex II (Fig. 8.77), was only very partially excavated (about 80 sq. m.). Fig. 8.100.

Area E, intact clay figurine adjacent to Wall E646 of Building Complex V (from the south). Most of the area was severely damaged by MB I Disturbance E636. The northern wall of Building V is the continuation of Wall E478 of Building Complex II, which continues into the unexcavated western edge of Area E. The eastern side of the building is defined by Wall E562/E606 of Room R in Building Complex II, and in the south Building V is bordered by the northwestern limits of Room U and the northern wall of Room V of Building Complex II. This connects to Wall E596, separating Building V from Building Complex IV to the south. Fig. 8.102. Area E, Floor E621 of Building Complex V with canine skull and bones (from the west). The section of the building that was excavated is divided into eastern outer and western inner sections by two walls, E646 and E625 , which create an L-shaped corner. In the eastern outer section, just south of Wall E478 in Square J42b, a floor level (E643) probably belongs to Phase E-4A, as a layer of debris below it reaches the walls of the building. On Floor E643 was a rounded installation consisting of a fragmentary circle of stones and mudbricks (E670). In the northeastern corner of this area (Walls E478 and E562), two poorly preserved human skulls were found (E581, Fig. 8.101). As they lie very close to the topsoil, it is unclear whether the skulls were buried in a small pit or placed on the floor. In the area between Walls E606 and E625, a debris layer and a floor level of Phase E-4 A were excavated. In the northern part of this area was a fragmentary canine skull with some lime plaster around it (E621, Fig. 8.102). The area west and south of Wall E625 and south of Wall E646 is severely disrupted by MB I Disturbance E636, and most of the fills here are of a mixed nature. However, an intact, seated female figurine was found adjacent to the southern face of Wall E646 (Debris E626, Basket E1823, Fig. 8.103). Wall E625 slopes sharply downwards to the south and its southern continuation in Square J42d is unclear, possibly eroded. A group of large stones partly excavated at the southern edge of Square J42d are roughly aligned with Wall E539 to the south of MB I Disturbance E636. These may be the continuation of Wall E625, thus creating a wall that curves to the west. 155</page><page sequence="174">CHAPTER 9 THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA F Michele A . Miller Area F is located ca. 500 m. northeast of Area E, in one of the banana groves of Kibbutz Masada (Figs. 9.1-9.2; see also plan Fig. 1.2). Following deep plowing by the kibbutz, rich concentrations of Yarmukian artifacts appeared on the surface. In 1998, three test pits, covering some 50 sq. m., were opened in order to obtain a better understanding of this remote area in the northeastern part of the site. Appendix 2 presents the loci defined in Area F. Square VV84d This square, at the far edge of the banana grove, yielded no finds at all, revealing only topsoil and sterile virgin soil. It seems to be located beyond the settlement area. Square WW80d This square is located in the center of the banana grove (Figs. 9.3-9.5). Two wide stone walls (F12 and F17) form the corner of a room. Inside the room, remains of a mud-plastered floor, F20, reached the wall (level -209.97). Fig. 9.1. Area F. general view of the excavations: Square WW80 in the foreground, Square WW74 in the background. Fig. 9.2. Area F, plan of excavation squares. Square WW74d In this square, also located in the middle of the banana grove (Figs. 9.6-9.8), the excavation was concentrated in the western half. Below the topsoil, two stone walls were discovered, creating a corner. Wall F6 is massive (1.2 m. wide) and has a north-south orientation, while Wall Fl 3 is smaller, running east- west. Plaster Floor Fl 5 (level -210.09) is associated with the northern side of Wall F13 (Fig. 9.9). Although only a small area was excavated in Area F, architecture clearly associated with Yarmukian finds was exposed. The remains of at least two large structures represent the type of architecture that is better known in Area E. Unfortunately, soon after excavation, Area F was planted with bananas that are scheduled to remain in the field until the year 2009. Only then can further excavation be conducted. Fig. 9.3.

For example, only two phases (2b2 and 2b 1) were discovered at Munhata (Perrot 1993b), there was a single stage of occupation at Hamadiya (Kaplan 1993), and only one or two phases ascribed to the Yarmukian culture were revealed at Habashan Street (Kaplan 1958), 'Ain Ghazal (Rollefson 1998), 'Ain Rahub (Muheisen et al. 1988) and Abu Thawwab (Kafafi 2001). At Nahal Qanah Cave, only scattered finds were excavated (Gopher and Tsuk 1996), and although at Byblos an accumulation of 1 m. of the Néolithique ancien was reported (Dunand 1973), part of this accumulation comprises PPNB remains (Garfinkel 2004b). Even at Sha'ar Hagolan, in Stekelis's sections (1972) and the trenches cut by local farmers and documented by us in 1998 the Neolithic layer was usually no more than 0.50 m. thick (Miller 2002). In Areas E, F and H of our excavations, we concentrated on the uppermost Yarmukian stratum and rarely reached the lower levels. The Yarmukian accumulation of approximately 2.5 m that we encountered in Area G is thus unusual, and consequently it was difficult for us to subdivide the deposits into shorter periods or cultural units based on comparative material. Area G is located on a slope about 100 m . northeast of Area E, its northern end higher by nearly 1 m. than its southern end. Preservation was better in the north and included Middle Bronze Age I, Early Bronze Age I and Yarmukian remains, while to the south these strata were eroded and only earlier Yarmukian remains were recovered, appearing immediately below the topsoil. The initial purpose of the excavations in this area was to verify the results of a magnetometric survey conducted over an area of 120 x 100 m, which indicated a strong anomaly in this location (Itkis 2002). In the first season of 1999, a north-south trench measuring 20 x 5 m. and comprising four 5x5 squares (P48a, P48c, 048a and 048c) was excavated on the western side of the surveyed area (Figs. 10.1-10.2). The trench was deepened in the second excavation season in 2000. No correlation was detected between the results of the magnetometric survey and the archaeological results obtained from the excavation. Nevertheless, it became apparent that the Yarmukian deposits in Area G exceed 2 m. in depth, creating a tell-like formation of strata. As such a considerable accumulation has not been encountered in any other area of Sha'ar Hagolan, or any other Yarmukian site, it was decided to continue excavating this area down to virgin soil to expose the entire Yarmukian sequence. In 2002, the third excavation season in Area G, the main aim was to reach virgin soil in the entire trench. By the final week of the season, the whole trench had been excavated to virgin soil Fig. 10.1. Area G, aerial view at the end of the first season of excavations in 1999 (from the south). 161</page><page sequence="178">CHAPTER 10 Fig. 10.2. Area G, general view at the end of the third season of excavations in 2002 (from the northeast). and in a few places test pits were dug below the Yarmuk River delta sediments into the underlying Lisan Formation. With this it seemed that the work had been concluded. However, in one square some remains were still visible and investigation revealed a circle of stones. Further cleaning clarified that this was a well dug into the virgin soil. We were able to unearth only its uppermost part during this last week. The second target of the 2002 season was to gather additional information on the upper Yarmukian sequence, which was better preserved in the northern part of Area G. Thus, an additional 5 x 5 m. square (Square P47b) was opened to the northwest of the original trench (Fig. 10.3). It was excavated for only one season to a depth of nearly 1 m., and the lower accumulation was not reached. In this new square, further evidence of MB I, EB I and late Yarmukian remains was uncovered. The fourth excavation season (2003) in Area G was completely dedicated to the excavation of the well (see Chapter 5). After a total of four seasons of excavation in Area G, the area was closed. Black geo-textile sheets were placed over the well and the architectural remains, and the entire area was backfilled to the level of the surrounding surface (Fig. 5.24). The very substantial accumulation in the area of the trench (Figs. 10.4-10.6) may be due to this being the center and core of the Yarmukian settlement, represented in this area by at least eight distinct strata. Thus, it is a very favorable location for determining the stratigraphie sequence of the site and studying the development and characteristics of this culture over time. Furthermore, in contrast to Areas E, F and H, where most of the area was apparently covered by houses, Area G has only a few fragmentary walls and various small architectural elements, while most of the area seems to have been open. The different features that were discovered, such as a well, stone concentrations, pits and a burial, may characterize the open areas of Yarmukian settlements. The material culture also differs in the relative frequency of flint axes, which are a rare find in the building complexes. STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE Fourteen strata, from topsoil to virgin soil, were defined in Area G. The complete sequence was achieved by integrating the data from the five different 5 x 5 m. excavation squares (048a/c, P48a/c, P47b), as in no single location was the entire sequence found superimposed (Table 10.1). Several of the strata exhibit two or three phases. The maximum depth was about 4.4 m. (from a level of -212.24 to a level of -216.63 m.). The lowest point in the trench was reached at the bottom of a deep pit belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic C, and the 162</page><page sequence="179">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA G Table 10.1 .

The remains of eight Yarmukian strata are sandwiched between later deposits and the lower natural sediments. However, due to various erosion processes, these strata were not evenly preserved on throughout the trench. There is a considerable natural inclination southwards of ca. 1 m. over a length of 20 m., and the primary erosion process was the cutting of the upper strata in the southern part of the trench (Squares 048a/c and part of P48c). Another source of erosion was a depression containing a later fill (MB I Disturbance G3), located on the northwestern edge of the excavated area (Squares P48a/c). This depression probably reflects a riverbed or gully postdating the Yarmukian occupation and predating the MB I occupation. The fourteen strata in Area G will be discussed from latest to earliest, as excavated. Strata G-2 and G-3 are later deposits dated to the Middle and Early Bronze Ages. The eight strata G-4 to G-ll represent the Yarmukian occupation and G-12 represents the PPNC phase. The two lowest strata, G-13 and G-14, comprise natural sediments. STRATUM G-l: TOPSOIL (Table 10.2) Stratum G-l represents the topsoil layer covering the entire area. Modern agricultural activities such as the construction of fish ponds in 1942, the subsequent clearing of these ponds during the 1950s, and the planting of mango, avocado and other crops, and finally banana trees, have all played a role in the destruction of the upper layers of the site. This upper layer contains mixed sediments, sometimes with Yarmukian artifacts not in situ , as well as MB I, Roman- Byzantine, Islamic and modern pottery sherds. There are no distinct architectural or other features that can be attributed to Stratum G-l. STRATUM G-2: MIDDLE BRONZE AGE I (Plan Fig. 10.7; Table 10.2) Stratum G-2 represents the MB I and comprises mainly a wide, deep fill deposited into a natural river-gully depression (Locus G3). The gully continues to the southwest and can also be seen in Area E (Stratum E-2, MB I Disturbance E636). This feature 163</page><page sequence="180">CHAPTER 10 d .o o &lt;D C/3 •4- &gt; &lt;Z) &lt;D £ O B "i o i- H bb E 164</page><page sequence="181">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA G Fig. 10.6. Area G, north section. was created subsequent to the Yarmukian settlement at the site but prior to or during the MB I. Consequently, the gully is filled with MB I sherds together with some earlier material. In Area G, the limits of the gully can be clearly defined and its depth is evident from the western and eastern sections of the trench (see Figs. 10.4-10.5). The gully is wider (up to 3 m.) on the east, while in the western section it is about 1 .5 m. wide. Stratum G-3 lies below the topsoil layer covering most of Square P48c and the southern part of Square P48a. It seems to slope down to the west, where it is thicker (over 0.50 m.) and reaches below elevation -214.00 m . A line of six stones oriented east- west in Square P48c, laid within the sediment of the MB I disturbance (G15, Fig. 10.8), may be the remains of a wall or some other feature attributable to Stratum G-2. STRATUM G-3: EARLY BRONZE AGE I (Plan Fig. 10.7; Table 10.2) Stratum G-3 represents the EB I, which has not been identified in any other area at Sha'ar Hagolan, although sherds with grain- wash decoration, indicating the existence of an EB I occupation, have been recognized on several occasions at the site. In Area G, only one feature, Pit G201 (Fig. 10.9) located in the northwestern corner of Square P47, can be dated to this Table 10.2. Loci of Strata G-l-G-4 (for further details see Appendix 3).

This pit contained a jar decorated with vertical stripes in the typical EB I grain- wash style of the northern valleys, found in two parts, one inside the other. Although the upper part of the pit was not preserved, it can be observed in the section to a depth of about 0.70 m., cutting through Floors G 195 and G 165 of Strata G-6 and G-5. It is possible that this is ajar burial, the bones of which were not preserved. STRATUM G-4: UPPERMOST YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 10.7; Table 10.2) Stratum G-4 is the uppermost Yarmukian layer, which in most cases comprises merely a fill above the Stratum G-5 remains mixed with topsoil. Stratum G-4 was completely eroded by natural or modern processes in Squares 048c and 048a, and by the MB I disturbance in Squares P48c and P48a. In Square P47b, also very poorly preserved, several upper fills (G 1 29 , G 1 3 1 , G 1 32) are a mixture of Strata G- 1 , G-4 and G-5 . However, one or two features in this square, such as four large stones (Wall G 152) lying above the western continuation of Wall G 135, can be assigned to this stratum. STRATUM G-5: YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 10.10; Table 103) Stratum G-5 was completely eroded in Squares 048c, 048a and P48c (Fig. 10.11), and in the eastern part of Square P48a the remains were cut by the MB I disturbance of Stratum G-3. Thus, in the 1999 excavation season, only the western part of Pebble Floor G6 was exposed in Square P48a. This area was not excavated any deeper and was connected to Square P47b in the west when the area was enlarged in the 2002 season. In Square P47b , the remains are quite close to the topsoil and recent plowing has caused damage to the architecture. Nevertheless, three phases were identified, indicating relatively intensive Yarmukian activities. Basically, the area can be divided into two units. In the east, a stone-paved floor existing during all three phases of Stratum 5 (Floors G6 and G165, Fig. 10.12) seems to be an open area. In the west, fragmentary stone walls (Walls G135, G136, G157) indicate that some building activity took place in this location. 166</page><page sequence="183">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA G Fig. 10.11. Area G, Stratum G-5 (from the west). Fig. 10.12. Area G, Stratum G-5, Floors G6 and G165 (from the south). Phase G-5A In the upper phase, Walls G 135 and G 157 form corners with Wall G136 (Fig. 10.13). Wall 136, which exists throughout all three phases of Stratum G-5, is a wide stone wall 0.50 m. wide and excavated to a length of about 1 .2 m. Wall G135, 0.60 m. Fig. 10.13. Area G, Phase G-5 A, the corner created by Walls G 136 and G 135 and Pavement G 162 of Phase G-5B. wide and two to three courses high, was preserved only in its eastern part. Several large stones to the west (Gl 59) could be eroded remains of this wall. Walls G 136 and Gl 35 create the corner of a rectilinear room continuing into the northwestern unexcavated area. A fragmentary pavement made of small flat pebbles within the room (Pavement G137, Fig. 10.13) was cut by Pit G201 of Stratum G-3. Wall G 157 is built of one course of elongated basalt river pebbles standing on their narrow side (Fig. 10.14). It is poorly preserved and a modern agricultural plow-tip was seen in the ground nearby. This somewhat curved wall creates, together with Wall G 135, another architectural unit. A concentration of large basalt stones in the southwestern corner of Square P47b may be the remains of a closing wall in the south (G158, Fig. 10.14 upper right). The floor of this room is G145 (Fig. 10.15). A similar floor level, with some preserved mud plaster (Gl 47), was excavated to the east of Wall G 157. Both these floors probably represent Phase G-5 A, as they appear to be above Floor G162 of Phase G-5B. Floor G147 seals Wall G188 of Phase G-5C. In the easternmost part of Square P47b, Stone Pavement G 165 is delimited on its west by a line of larger stones, thus creating a passage or alleyway east of Walls Gl 36 and G157, 1 m. wide and 5 m. long. This alleyway did not exist in Phases G-5B-C, as Wall G188 blocked the passage. Phase G-5B The distinctive feature of this phase is a fragmentary pavement west of Wall G136 (G162, Figs. 10.16-17) and the debris above it (Gl 66). This pavement, made of rounded basalt pebbles, was found below Wall Gl 35 of Phase G-5 A. Mud-plaster Floor G 163 (Fig. 10.18) is probably the southern continuation of Pavement G162. East of Wall G136 this phase is represented by Fill G161 , which was found below Floor G 147 of Phase G-5 A. Phase G-5C Wall Gl 36 continues to the north into the balk, while its southern continuation was possibly dismantled when the later Walls G 135 and G 157 were added. It is preserved to a height of two courses and slopes down to the south. One of its eastern stones is a basalt mortar in secondary use. The lower part of this wall is adjoined by Wall Gl 88, which consists 167</page><page sequence="184">CHAPTER 10 Fig. 10.14. Area G, Phase G-5A, the western part of Square P47b. Fig. 10.15.

Another irregular line of stones to the south (Gl 89) is the continuation of Wall G 188, which together form a semicircular installation attached to Wall 136 from the east. The limited exposure and later damage prevent reconstruction of the Stratum G-5 structure in Square P47b. STRATUM G-6: YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 10.19; Table 10.4) Stratum G-6 was excavated mainly in Square P47b, with some remains also preserved in Square P48a. The remains in Square P48c were damaged by the MB I disturbance of Stratum G-2, while in Square 048c and most of 048a, Stratum G-6 168</page><page sequence="185">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA G Fig. 10.19.

In general, the remains of Stratum G-6 are meager and contain no substantial architectural elements. In Square P48a, a beaten-earth floor and two pits were excavated. Floor G7, which occupies most of the square, is covered by a thick debris layer and slopes down to the south. Pit G 141 on the southern edge of Square P48a (Fig. 10.20) has a diameter of ca. 0.50 m. and is over 0.60 m. deep. It is bell-shaped, wider at the bottom, and was filled with stones. The other pit dug from the level of Floor G7, Pit G 13, on the northern edge of Square P48a (Fig. 10.21), is larger and shallower than Pit G 14 (at least 1 .4 m. in diameter) and was also filled with stones. The northern part of the pit lies in the unexcavated area. In Square P47b, only the fills, upper debris and upper floors of Stratum G-6 were reached by the end of the 2002 excavation season. Consequently, very few walls from this stratum were uncovered, in contrast to several walls excavated in Stratum G-5 above it. Floor G 182, the layer of pebbles in the eastern part of Square P47b, may be a continuation of Floor G7. This open area extends over ca. 5 x 2.5 m. The only certain wall from Stratum G-6 is a north-south line of stones in the southern part of Square P47b (Wall G190). It is only 1 m. long, but a thick patch of lime-plaster floor, 0.50 x 0.30 m., reaches it from the east (Floor G 1 96 , Figs . 1 0 .22- 1 0 .24) . The good preservation of the plaster enables observation of its construction technique; it was made up of two layers, the upper one darker and the other lighter and filled with small rounded pebbles. Several large stones east of Floor G 196 may be the remains of another wall (G200), possibly better preserved in the lower levels that were not reached in this area. To the west of Wall G190, an area with pebbles was excavated (Gl 92), but the floor level was not clearly identified. In the northern part of Square P47b, a debris layer and several patches of mud-plaster floor were excavated. It should be noted that this layer was not completely unearthed. In the northwestern part of the square another floor level (G 1 95) is cut by Pit G201 of Stratum G-3. To the east of this, a better- Fig. 10.20. Area G, Stratum G-6, Pit G14 (from the south).

STRATUM G-7: YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 10.25; Table 10.5) Stratum G-7 is represented only in the eastern part of Square P48a. In Square 048c the remains were eroded, while in Squares P48c and 048a the MB I disturbance (Locus G3, Stratum G-2) has destroyed Strata G-4 to G-7, apart from some mixed fills (Loci G2 and G39) that may be related to this stratum.

A fragment of an east- west stone wall, about 1 m. long and 0.80 m. wide, was found in the western excavated part of Square P48a (Wall G20, Fig. 10.26). It is relatively massive, built of a frame of two outer rows of large river pebbles filled with smaller stones.

Only one or two courses of stones are preserved of Wall G20, which is not accompanied by any other walls.

A similar installation (E433) was found in Room O of Building II in Area E. Installation G23 seals a rounded pit (G37), which may belong to Stratum G-8. STRATUM G-8: YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 10.25; Table 10.6) Stratum G-8 has been completely eroded in Square 048c and the southern part of 048a. In the northern part of the trench, only scanty remains of this stratum were identified. A partly preserved mud-plaster floor covers the eastern part of Square 048a (Floor G22, Fig. 10.29). The foundation of the floor (Floor Make-up G41), a layer 0.05-0.10 m. thick of small and medium-sized rounded pebbles, was clearly identified. A similar mud-plaster floor with a pebble foundation was preserved in Square P48c (Floor Gil and Floor Make-up G49) . A concentration of larger stones and lumps of clay (Gl 8) on Floor Gil comprises the remains of an installation, possibly Table 10.6. Loci of Stratum G-8 (for further details see Appendix 3).

A few distinct elements of Stratum G-8 were identified in Square P48a, including a large basalt mortar in the eastern balk (G62, Fig. 10.30), standing nearly upright in situ on a Stratum G-8 floor (according to its elevation at ca. -214.10 m., although the floor itself was not preserved). In other areas of Square P48a, fills and debris levels (G25, G27) and remains of a pit (G37) were excavated (Pit G37 may also belong to Stratum G-7). A debris layer mixed with stones, lying above the stone concentrations of Stratum G-l 1 , can also be assigned to Stratum G-8 (Locus G61). STRATUM G-9: YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 1031; Table 10.7) The architectural remains of Stratum G-9 comprise two or three fragmentary walls in Square 048c. A section of a stone wall, 2 m. long and 0.50 m. wide (Wall G33), lies above and south of Wall G64 of Stratum G-10, and a one-meter section of a north-south stone wall, about 0.40 m. wide, was preserved near the western balk (Wall G29, Fig. 10.32). A presumed corner between Walls G33 and G29 was not preserved. Several stones adjoining the northern edge of Wall G29 may be remnants of an east- west wall parallel to Wall G33 (Wall 172</page><page sequence="189">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA G Fig. 10.30. Area G, Stratum G-8, Mortar G62 lying in the eastern balk, stone concentrations of Stratum G-ll in foreground (from the west). G29a). Thus, a rectangular space about 1 m. wide and at least 4 m. long can be reconstructed. Its eastern wall would lie to the east in the unexcavated area and the entrance may have been through Wall G33 near the corner with Wall G29. It is unknown why the northern wall is so poorly preserved. Near the southern end of Wall G29, a limited patch of small, densely packed pebbles may be the remains of the room's floor (Floor G21a). A small concentration of stones was also found in the eastern part of Square 048c (G21). To the south of Wall G33, a relatively thick layer of debris with stony patches, probably floors or floor foundations, was excavated (G8, Fig. 10.33). These floor levels reach Wall G33 in certain places. Half of a deep rounded pit was excavated in the southeastern corner of Square 048a (Pit G 168), its complete diameter probably no more than 1.5 m. Pit G 168 is thus a small pit about 1.15 m. deep, which cut Wall G64 of Stratum G-10 and the floors related to it, the debris layer of Stratum G-ll, and the river wash of Stratum G-12, and penetrated several centimeters into the Lisan Formation. At the bottom of the pit was a layer of very large stones, above which were many large, well-preserved sherds and animal bones. Fig. 10.31 . Area G, plan of Stratum G-9. A smaller and shallower, rounded pit, located to the west of Pit G168 in Square 048a (G35), is about 0.60 m. in diameter and was found filled with stones. Square 048a and the southern part of Square P48c were covered with a debris layer with preserved patches of mud-plaster floor (Floor G79).

Three rounded concentrations of stones of various sizes were found on Floor G79 (G69, Fig. 10.34; G94 and G96). In the northern part of Square P48c, Floor G57 of Phase G-9A comprises patches of mud plaster above a foundation of small rounded pebbles. There are no distinct Stratum G-9 remains in Square P48a, which is occupied by the stone concentrations of Stratum G-l 1 (see below). STRATUM G-10: YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 1035; Table 10.8) Stratum G-10, better preserved than Stratum G-9, is the earliest stratum in Area G with domestic architecture. The main feature of this stratum is a corner created by two massive walls in Squares 048a/c. The walls have two construction phases, G-l OB and G-10A, with several floors and other features relating to them. In the northern part of the trench, only meager remains of this stratum, defined as general Stratum G-10, were identified. Wall G64, located at the southern edge of Square 048a (Figs. 10.36-10.37), is a stone wall oriented east-west, 1 m. wide and 3.2 m. long. The eastern part of Wall G64 is missing, as it was cut by Pit G 168 dug from Stratum G-9. The wall was preserved to a maximum height of about 0.40 m. in places, and up to four courses of stones can be seen. It slopes down to the east and the southern face is better preserved than the northern one. Wall G64 adjoins Wall Gl 19, which lies partly in the western balk of the trench in Square 048c (Fig. 10.38), creating a nearly right-angled corner. Wall Gl 19, oriented Fig. 10.32. Area G, Stratum G-9, Walls G33 (right), G29 (front) and G29a (left) (from the west). north-south with a slight slant to the east, is also a thick stone wall (at least 0.70 m. wide), although its full width cannot be measured. It was exposed to a length of 3 m. but continues southwest into the unexcavated area. Up to four courses of stones were preserved of this wall, about 0.40 m. high at its northern end. The two walls were built of a frame of two outer rows of large river pebbles, measuring up to 0.50 m., filled with smaller stones (the "frame-and-fill" method). Above these stone foundations there was probably a brick superstructure, which is not preserved. One of the stones in the southern face of Wall G64 was a deep basalt basin turned upside down, probably originating in Stratum G-ll and now in secondary use (Fig. 10.37-10.38). This is evidence of the recycling of stone vessels as building material. Two distinct constructional phases related to Walls G64 and Gl 19 can be discerned in Square 048c. A single row of stones, 2 m. long, lies adjacent to the southern face of Wall G64 (Wall G 122, Fig. 10.36), while a similar row of stones, 2.2 m. long, lies alongside Wall Gl 19 on the east (Wall G141). These two higher walls are later additions representing Phase G-10A of the structure. Features that relate to Walls G64 and Gl 19 and lie below these walls are assigned to Phase G-l 0B.

(Floor G67, Fig. 10.39), made of small and medium-sized pebbles, was probably the foundation of a mud-plaster floor. This floor slopes slightly eastwards, as does Wall G64. A rounded pit, 0.30 m. wide, was dug from this floor (Pit G76, Fig. 10.39). Another rounded pit filled with stones is located near Wall Gl 19 (Pit G47); as it was dug from a higher level, it probably should be assigned to Phase G-10A. A pebbled area south of Wall G64 is a floor or foundation of Phase G-10A (G58). Table 10.8. Loci of Stratum G- 1 0 (for further details see Appendix 3).

A lower floor level was identified, comprising two layers of mud plaster (G84). In the northern part of Square 048a, at a higher elevation possibly representing Phase G-10A, a debris layer with patches of mud plaster and several brick fragments was uncovered (G78, G42 with unfinished limestone bowl, Fig. 10.40). Several stone concentrations in Square 048a include Loci G70, G72 and G83 just north of Wall G64, Locus G71 further north, and a rectangular concentration of stones on the northern edge of Square 048a (G86). As no distinct feature of Stratum G-10 is located above Well G185 of Stratum G-ll (in the center of Square 048a), it seems reasonable that the well continued in use in Stratum G-10. Further north, in Square P48c, a fragmentary floor level 175</page><page sequence="192">CHAPTER 10 Fig. 10.35. Area G, plan of Stratum G-10, the earliest Yarmukian architecture. Fig. 10.36.

(Gl 09), preserved mainly in the southern part of the square, was composed of mud plaster laid upon a pebble layer. In the northern part of the trench, as noted above, the massive stone concentrations of Stratum G-ll were probably not cleared during Stratum G-10. Near the eastern balk of Square P48a, the edge of a very deep, barrel-shaped pit was found (Pit G 174). From the section it is apparent that the pit becomes significantly wider in its middle part, while the upper and lower parts are very narrow. The upper part of the pit is also lined with stones. The pit cuts into the stone concentrations of Stratum G-ll and the river wash of Stratum G- 12, reaching deep into the Lisan Formation. The lower part of the pit was rich in large pottery sherds (Fig. 10.41). It was possibly a wide rounded pit, 2 m. in diameter. If Pit G174 is related to Stratum G-10, it had a depth of about 1 .1 m., while if it were dug from Stratum G-9, it would have had a depth of about 1 .5 m. The two massive walls in the southern part of the trench, Walls G64 and Gl 19, may be viewed as part of a large courtyard building similar to those excavated in Areas E and H and probably delimit a room, part of which was excavated in Square 048c. As no architecture was found in the rest of the excavated area, it is most likely that the building extended to the south of the excavated area. Thus, the area north of the building was an unspecified open area between buildings and, as noted above, it probably contained a well and stone concentrations to the north of it. 176</page><page sequence="193">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA G Fig. 10.38.

STRATUM G-ll: EARLY YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 10.42; Table 10.9) Stratum G-ll represents the earliest Yarmukian settlement in Area G and possibly at the entire site of Sha'ar Hagolan. The remains do not include structures and vary in character between the different squares in the trench, probably due to the nature of this locality as an open area within the settlement. Another possibility is that the initial stage of the Yarmukian occupation at Sha'ar Hagolan was characterized by a lower level of architectural activity.

It should be noted that in the southern square, the foundations of Walls G64 and Gl 19 of Stratum G-10 seal the Stratum G-ll features. The well The most impressive feature of the occupation in Area G is the well in Square 048a (Gl 85), a detailed description of which is presented in Chapter 5. The outer diameter of the well is 1-1.2 m. and its inner diameter is ca. 0.50 m. A foundation pit surrounding the well, 2.2-2.3 m. wide, was identified (G177, Fig. 10.43). The well is 4.26 m. deep, reaching the current levels of the water table. Only the upper 2.5 m . were stone-built. The uppermost course of stones preserved in situ comprises larger and flatter stones, creating a more stable Fig. 10.42. Area G, plan of Strata G-ll (Early Yarmukian) and G-12 (PPNC). Fig. 10.43.

There was originally another course of large stones above it, although these stones were not found in position but scattered to some distance from the well. The mouth of the well can be reconstructed at a level of about -215.25 m.* still ca. 0.20-0.30 m. lower than the Stratum G-ll floor debris. The foundation pit of Well G185 lies about 0.75 m. below Wall G64 of Stratum G-10. Since no Stratum G-10 feature overlies the well itself, however, the well probably continued in use during Stratum G-10. By then the upper part of the well would have been about 0.60 m. below the floor levels, still reasonably accessible by a step or two. In Stratum G-9 there are several features above the well, showing that it had gone out of use and can be considered as sealed by the Stratum G-9 remains. When the well went out of use, the shaft itself and the depression around it were filled with sediment (Fill G 193) containing pottery, flint, bones and charcoal and dating mainly from the period immediately postdating the end of the usage of the well. The presence of such a well in the earliest stage of Yarmukian occupation at Sha'ar Hagolan testifies to a high degree of hydrological knowledge and sophisticated building techniques, as well as a notable level of public effort and planning. Fig. 10.45. Area G, Stratum G-ll (Early Yarmukian), close-up of Locus G 149 with a pottery bowl. Pits Two or three pits were revealed in Stratum G-ll: Pit G91. Adjacent to the western balk of Square 048c, part of a rounded pit was excavated (Fig. 10.44). As most of the pit remains unexcavated, it is difficult to determine its shape or the level from which it was dug. However, it lies below Wall Gl 19 (Stratum G-10) and cuts the upper part of Pit G191 (Stratum G-12). The outline of this pit can be seen in the western section. It is about 1 .10 m. wide, at least 1 .60 m. deep and is filled with sandy material and some stones. It contained a burial that included several skulls and miscellaneous bones representing two or three individuals, probably in secondary burial, about 1.4 m . above the bottom of the pit. This burial was not excavated. Pit G149. Just north of the burial, the rounded edge of another pit was identified (Fig. 10.45) containing a complete ceramic bowl. It is possible that Pit G 149 is actually part of Burial Pit G91 or cuts it, thus reflecting a later layer or phase. Stones G118. In the southwestern corner of the trench, a rounded concentration of stones continuing into the unexcavated area was partly excavated; it may be the bottom of a pit. 179</page><page sequence="196">CHAPTER 10 Fig. 10.46. Area G, Stratum G-l 1 (Early Yarmukian), burnt bricks on Floor G179 (Locus G171). Pits have been found in large numbers at Pottery Neolithic sites such as Munhata (Perrot 1964, 1966) and Jericho (Kenyon 1981: 92-94, 136-138, 254-257, 311-314). They could have served for storage, or perhaps were dug as quarries for clay to be used in brick or pottery making (Kenyon 1981: 116). Occupation and debris layers Only a small floor area assigned to Stratum G-ll was preserved in Square P48c (Gl 79), characterized by a layer of rounded pebbles measuring about 2.2 x 1.3 m. and a high concentration of finds. As the pebbles are well sorted and measure 0.03-0.06 m., this was probably a mud-plaster floor foundation laid into the sterile river-wash layer. Several fragments of rounded, burnt mudbricks were found on the floor, possibly remains of a rounded installation such as a hearth (G171, Fig. 10.46). In Squares 048a and P48c, Stratum G-ll is characterized by intermittent layers including a mixture of river-wash sediment and occupation debris (Fig. 10.47). While there are no clearly identifiable beaten-earth floors, there is evidence of human occupation in the form of cultural material and changes in the texture of the sediment (Loci G87 and G 128), testifying to activities that moved river-wash sediment from place to place. This debris layer is 0.20-0.60 m. thick (elevations -214.75 to -215.25) and lies upon the sterile river wash of Stratum G-l 3. It can be seen as whitish sediment in the western balk, appearing somewhat higher in the southern part of Square 048a. In the northern 5-6 m. of the trench (especially Square P48a), the Stratum G-ll remains are different in character. Most of this area is covered with a massive concentration of stones (defined here as a single feature, G46, Figs. 10.48- 10.50) lying on the ri ver- wash layer. This concentration of relatively large flint, basalt and limestone pebbles, 0.20-0.40 m. in size, is definitely not a natural phenomenon and should be associated with the Stratum G-ll activities. It can be clearly differentiated from the unsorted river-wash sediment and contains large amounts of finds, especially flint cores. The matrix of this feature, comprising only about 30-50% of its substance, is a dark clayey soil. This layer of stones is highest Fig. 10.47.

(elevations -214.44 to -215.05 m.). In several places the stone concentration of Stratum G-ll stands higher than the elevations of later strata, until it is sealed by Stratum G-7 floors. Thus, it is likely that this stone layer remained visible and was not cleared away during the subsequent Strata G-10 to G-8. Fig. 10.49. Area G, Stratum G-ll (Early Yarmukian), Stone Concentration G 1 08 . Fig. 10.50. Area G, Stratum G-ll (Early Yarmukian), close-up of Stone Concentration Gl 16. Such a massive and long-lasting pile of stones is unparalleled and is not easy to explain. It may initially have comprised a pile created by some building or quarrying activities, later used as a dump that was never cleared away, becoming larger and higher. A possible scenario is that all the large stones resulting from the digging of Well G 185 , and possibly Pits G91, G149 and Gl 18, were piled to the north of these features. The soft sediment from these endeavors, mostly Lisan marl, was used for making bricks or pottery or spread around Well G 185. However, the only evidence for this suggestion is the spatial proximity of the well, the large stone concentration and the pits. Later on, in Strata G-10 and G-9, the pile may have become larger in the course of further dumping in the area. In summary, the first Yarmukian occupants of Sha'ar Hagolan came to an area located on the Yarmuk River delta covered with ri ver- wash sediments. Initially, Pit Gl 91 was dug (perhaps an earlier, unsuccessful attempt to dig a well?); subsequently, Well Gl 85 was built, creating a large pile of stones in the northern area. The activity around the well was possibly related to the making of bricks and later pottery. The houses were built in a different area. Some of the features of Stratum G-ll remained in use into Stratum G-10 and possibly G-9. STRATUM G-12: PRE-POTTERY NEOLITHIC C (Plan Fig. 10.42; Table 10.10) The earliest evidence of human occupation in Area G apparently dates from the PPNC. While in Area E this period is represented by ca. 1 m. of accumulation, in Area G there are only sporadic remains; the single definite feature is Pit G191 (Figs. 10.51-10.52), which was clearly identified during the excavation. Although it was not possible to differentiate other PPNC sediments or features in the field, the material culture remains and the early radiometric dates from Area G clearly indicate that some human activity took place here in this period. Pit G191 (which includes Loci G103 and G194) is the earliest human element in Area G, based on three indications: 1 Stratigraphie considerations-it is cut by Pits G91 and G 149 of Stratum G-ll.

Locus No. Location Type G103 Q48c Pit G191 048c Pit ~G'94 048c Pit 2 Material culture-Pit G191 contained no pottery but did contain large flint blades, more typical of the PPNC. 3 Radiometric dating-the 14C dates from the pit are clearly earlier than those of the Yarmukian strata (see Chapter 1). Pit G191 is a deep, wide, barrel-shaped pit, i.e., narrower at the top and bottom and wider in the middle, as can be observed in the section (Fig. 10.42, section). The mouth of the pit is rounded, with a maximum diameter of 2 m. The pit was dug into the river wash and the Lisan Formation of Strata G-14 and G-13; the laminations of the Lisan layer can be seen clearly in the section (Figs. 10.51-10.52). The exact level from which Pit G191 was dug was not identified, perhaps because the Stratum G-ll pits destroyed the upper part. It is preserved to a depth of 1 .20 m., but was probably deeper. The upper fill of the pit was somewhat richer in artifacts, including flint, bones and charcoal, but no pottery. From 0.80 m. below the opening and down, the sediment was poorer in finds, while the lowest 0.20 m. contained many stones (Locus G194; Fig. 10.52). Another element that may be associated with this stratum (or Stratum G-l 1) is a large, deep pit discerned in the western section of the trench (G208) in the final days of the 2002 season. During the following winter it was further exposed by the elements but remained unexcavated (Fig. 10.53). The pit sediment was dark and contained some flint artifacts but apparently no pottery sherds. The seemingly very large size and depth of this pit, as it appears in the section, suggests a resemblance to the foundation pit of the well. It is thus at least possible that there were two wells at the base of Area G. Stratum G-12 reflects scanty PPNC activities in Area G, Fig. 10.53.

Its sediments are mixed to a certain extent with those of Stratum G-ll and with pits cut from upper strata. STRATUM G-13: THE RIVER WASH (Table 10.11) This natural layer of ri ver- wash accumulation, or flood layer, lies above the Lisan Formation (Fig. 10.54). On top of this layer the first Yarmukian human settlement was established; thus, Stratum G-13 should be defined as the virgin soil of the site. It was formed by the intermittent flooding of the Yarmuk River in the period prior to human occupation. The site is located about 1.5 km. from the outlet of the Yarmuk River where it exits the Gilead Mountains, at the southern corner of the delta, and was thus covered with ri ver- wash sediment only in years when the river heavily overflowed. This layer of river wash consists of a variety of smooth rounded, angular and elongated stones, ranging in size from 0.05 m. pebbles to 0.50 m. boulders. The matrix is made up of Lisan marl, darker compact clayish soil and granular sediments with sand and small pieces of crushed basalt. In some areas this sediment is very compact (as in Probe G 198 in Square P48c). 182</page><page sequence="199">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA G Fig. 10.54. Area G, Stratum G-13, the river wash. The mixed composition of this sediment is representative of the force of the flooding that deposited it. The ri ver- wash layer of Stratum G-13 was exposed over most of the four squares, ca. 80 sq. m. (mainly in Locus G173). In the probes, its thickness ranges between 0.30 and 0.60 m.

The upper part of Stratum G-13 is mixed somewhat with sediments and material-culture debris of Strata G-12 and G-ll. Nevertheless, the lower sediments are completely sterile of finds, attesting to the absence of any earlier Yarmukian activities in the area. In places the lower part of Stratum G-13 was mixed with Lisan sediments of Stratum G-14 and in several cases the river wash apparently penetrated the soft Lisan Formation, as in Locus G 184 of Probe Gl 81 (Fig. 10.55), where the river-wash layer reaches at least 0.30 m. below the Lisan layer. STRATUM G-14: THE LISAN MARL FORMATION Stratum G-14, the deepest stratum reached in the excavation (Figs. 10.53, 10.56, Color Plate IXb), is a natural geological layer of the Lisan Formation. The Lisan Formation is present in various forms throughout the Jordan Valley and constitutes the geological foundation of the central Jordan Valley. It was created by the Pleistocene Lisan Lake that existed in the Jordan Valley between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee (Begin 1975; Horowitz 1979). The composition of this formation, exposed in various locations around the site is aragonite varves, sandstone, gravel, conglomerate, mudstone and 183</page><page sequence="200">CHAPTER 10 Fig. 10.56. Area G, plan of Strata G-13 (river delta) and G-14 (Lisan Formation). gypsum (Sneh, Bartov and Rosensaft 1998). Since the Lisan Lake dried up some 15,000 years ago, anything deposited upon the Lisan marl is later in date. The Lisan marl itself is a soft sedimentary rock appearing as a lamination of very light whitish-brown and darker gray layers (see Chapter 5) that represent seasonal deposits on the bed of the lake. The variations in color are created by the Fig. 10.57. Area G, Probe G 197 dug into the Yarmuk river wash (G-13) and the Lisan Formation (G-14). different mineralogical compositions of the layers, mainly by differing quantities of calcite and aragonite. This sediment is completely sterile of archaeological finds. It should be noted that Lisan marl is an excellent raw material for brick and pottery manufacture, and consequently was the main component of most of the mudbricks and ceramics at Sha'ar Hagolan (Goren 1991, 1992; Cohen- Weinberger 2002; Zuckerman 2002). There was no benefit to be gained from reaching this layer over the entire 125 sq. m. of the trench, especially as it was covered with a thick deposit of natural river wash (Stratum G-13), and it was therefore exposed in relatively small areas. The Lisan Formation was first observed at the bottom of deep, round Neolithic pits penetrating the natural deposit layers. These include: 1 Pit 191 of Stratum G-12 in Square 048c. 2 Pits Gl 18 and G 149 of Stratum G-ll in Square 048c. 3 Pit G174 of Strata G-9/G-10 in Square P48a. 4 Pit G 168 of Stratum G-9 in Square 048a-c. The Lisan Formation was subsequently excavated in three rectilinear test probes: 1 Probe G181 (1.50 x 1.0 m.) in Square P48c (Fig. 10.55). 2 Probe G197 (lxl m.) in Square P48a (Fig. 10.57). 3 Probe G 199 (1 x 1 m.) in Square 048a. The largest exposure of the Lisan Formation was carried out while excavating Well G 185 of Stratum G-ll in Square 048a, where a section ca. 4 m. deep was unearthed. The top of the Lisan Formation was not at the same elevation throughout the trench. Since part of this layer was removed by human activity in the rounded Neolithic pits, it was not always possible to determine from the section the original uppermost level of the Lisan layer. In the probe in the northern part of the trench (Gl 97), the layer is identified at an elevation of -215.73 m., in Square P48c at level -215.35 m. (Probe 181), and in Probe G199 in Square 048a and in Square 048c around Pit G191 at level -215.30 m. This difference probably implies a certain slope of the original topography towards the riverbank in the south. However, due to the very limited exposure, it is not possible to describe the contour of the Lisan Formation with any certainty. 184</page><page sequence="201">CHAPTER 11 THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA H Area H is the second largest horizontal exposure of our excavations, located some 200 m. northwest of Area E in the southeastern corner of a former fishpond (Fig. 11.1). A total area of ca. 700 sq. m. was opened during three seasons (1999, 2000, 2003) (Figs. 11.2-11.3). The eastern edge of the excavation is bordered by a fishpond embankment that prevents future extension in this direction (Fig. 11 .4). The northern and southern sides can still be enlarged by 5-10 m., while towards the west there is no limit. The architecture in Area H is similar in construction to Fig. 11.1.

The northern half of Area H appears to contain a large building complex with a central courtyard surrounded by 10 rooms (Building Complex I). A street running east-west was uncovered to the north of the building. Small segments of at least four additional building complexes were revealed, one to the north of the street and three surrounding Building Complex I. Four strata were defined in Area H, Strata H-l to H-4, more or less parallel to Strata E-l to E-4 of Area E. Stratum Fig. 1 1 .2.

H-l represents the topsoil with some late antique and modern features, Stratum H-2 contains meager MB I elements, and Stratum H-3 comprises Neolithic elements that are later than the main architectural stratum in the area, Stratum H-4. Stratum H-4 has at least two constructional phases, the upper one badly damaged, the lower one much better preserved. The excavation did not reach elements predating this architecture. STRATUM H-l: TOPSOIL (Plan Fig. 11.4; Table 11.1) Stratum H-l is a mixture of modern fishpond sediment and regular alluvial soil containing some Byzantine and Islamic sherds as well as earlier artifacts, as similarly defined in Areas E and G. It varies in thickness and in the eastern 2 m. of Squares AA43a-c, BB43a-c, CC43a-c and in Squares BB43b-d and CC43d, this layer is much thicker than in other places. This thicker layer is mostly a damp, dark brown, fine-grained ("clayey") soil, in places relatively rich in Neolithic finds. This may be the result of disturbance of the original Neolithic debris during the history of the modern fishponds. The dark topsoil layer can be seen below the asphalt road built on the ramp during the early 1970s (Fig. 11.5). Post-MB I features assigned to the uppermost stratum include: 1 Installation H 135 in Square Z42d lies above and cuts Walls H 134 and H 148 of Stratum H-4. The installation comprises a large slab of basalt encircled by smaller stones, and an iron blade was found inside it. This feature may be dated to the Byzantine period or later. 2 In the north of Square AA43c and in southern Square AA43a, an area with several concentrations of large stones was exposed (H410). The stones and the sediment between them lie above the Neolithic architecture and contain many Byzantine sherds and large bovine bones (Figs. 11.6-11.7). 3 In Square Z42c a rounded concentration of stones (HI 17), which cuts Wall H 130 of Stratum H-4, is probably a pit dug from Stratum H-l . 4 In the southwestern corner of the excavation, Square Z41d, a modern trench measuring 2 x 1 m. (Soil Trench XII, H151) cuts all the elements in that area. This is one of many illegal soil trenches dug by mechanical equipment in 1998, in order to examine the soil for agricultural usage (Miller 2002: Fig. 3.2). 5 In Squares BB41b-CC41d, a rectangular disturbance cuts the western part of the plastered street and the walls in this area (H452). This disturbance, 0.90 m. wide and at least 4 m. long , can also be interpreted as a trench created by mechanical equipment. It is about 0.45 m. deep and filled with sediments containing Neolithic finds. This could be explained by the trench's having been immediately backfilled with the soil that was removed from it. Uneven concentrations of large stones to the south of the trench (H310 and H474) may also be part of the fill of this modern disturbance. STRATUM H-2: THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE I (Table 11 2) Only a few elements represent the MB I occupation in Area H, mainly concentrations of sherds such as a small area in the southern balk of Square AA43c (H5 15) and two larger patches with stones and many MB I sherds in Square BB43a-c (H290 186</page><page sequence="203">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA H Fig. 11.4.

These remains may reflect pits dug in open areas near the MB I settlement excavated by E. Eisenberg in 1980 (Eisenberg 1993). STRATUM H-3: YARMUKIAN (Plan Fig. 11.4; Table 113) Stratum H-3 is defined as the Neolithic elements lying above the main architectural phase of Stratum H-4. Remains of later 188</page><page sequence="205">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA H Neolithic phases were not preserved due to erosion over the millennia, as well as more recent modern agricultural activities. In most cases this stratum consists merely of fills lying above the Stratum H-4 walls. Nevertheless, in the southern part of the area, several walls, installations and pits that cut through or are not aligned with the Stratum H-4 architecture are evidently later. They are assigned to Stratum H-3, although in some cases they could also be attributed to the upper phase of the Stratum H-4 architecture (H-4 A). As the architectural plan of Stratum H-4 in the southern part of the area is unclear, these elements are often defined as "Stratum H-3/H-4a" in the locus list. Further excavations in this location may modify some of the conclusions presented here (Fig. 11.8). In Square Z41b, adjacent to the western balk, a rounded installation made of large stones, possibly a hearth (HI 83), lies above all the other features in the vicinity. A stone wall oriented southwest-northeast lies above the open area of Stratum H-4 Building Complex V (Squares Z41b, H159). It was constructed of two rows of carefully laid headers with a fill of smaller stones in between; this building technique is different from that used in Stratum H-4. Moreover, the wall is not aligned with other Stratum H-4 walls and seems to disregard the earlier architecture. In Square Z42a, a rounded concentration of stones (HI 22) may also be attributed to Stratum H-3. In the southwestern part of Building Complex III (Square AA41b, Loci H207 and H458), several stone Table 11 .3. Loci of Stratum H-3 (for further details see Appendix 4).

Area H, Wall H524 of Stratum H-3 . concentrations are probably related to pits dug from above Stratum H-4. Similarly, a possible pit (H223) cuts into the pavement of Room E of Stratum H-4 Building Complex I. In the northeastern corner of the area, Wall H524 may be a later feature, as it does not relate to Building Complex I (Fig. 11.9). It is a concentration, 3 m. long, of stones of various sizes, some flat and others irregular, which are not arranged as a wall and may be either remains of a collapsed or badly damaged wall. STRATUM H-4: YARMUKIAN (Plans Figs. 11.10-11.12) Stratum H-4, which was extensively exposed, is the main stratum of Yarmukian architecture in Area H. The architectural layout includes one complete building (Building Complex I), four or five partial buildings (Building Complexes II, III, IV, V and VI), several open areas, and a plastered street (Fig. 11.10). This stratum was covered in several places by fills of Stratum H-3 and cut or disturbed by elements of Strata H-3 and H-2, while in many cases the remains of Stratum H-4 lie just below the topsoil. Two construction phases (H-4A and H-4B) were defined in Stratum H-4. Phase H-4 A is poorly preserved in the central part of Area H, better preserved on the western and eastern edges, and especially well preserved in the southeastern part of Fig. 11.10. Schematic plan of Stratum H-4. Building Complex I (Squares AA43a-c, Z43a). In most cases, Phase H-4 is represented by higher floor or debris levels and isolated installations in open areas. Since most of the walls and the general architectural layout do not vary from the lower to upper phase, we can reconstruct a complete plan according to the remains of the two phases. There are, however, several exceptions, as in Room G and possibly in Room K of Building Complex I, where the Phase H-4 A rooms are considerably smaller than those of Phase H-4B. STREET H473 (Plan Fig. 11.11) The street extends at least 20 m. from east to west in a slightly curving line through Squares CC41d-CC43c (Figs. 11.13- 11.16). It is 1.7-2 m. wide in the west and narrows to about 1 .2 m. in the east, where it turns slightly to the north following the outline of Rooms J and K of Building Complex I. The construction of the street in Area H is even more remarkable than that in Area E; it is composed of layers of mud-plaster surfacing lying upon a foundation of small rounded pebbles (Figs. 11.17-11.19), reflecting regular, intensive repairs of the plastered surfaces. The uppermost layers of plaster, some of them very smooth and level, were discovered just a few centimeters below the surface. The sediment upon the street is not sterile as in Street E8 of Area E, but here and there contains a few finds such as sherds, flint and bones. 190</page><page sequence="207">Fig. 11.11.

Area H, the western section of the plastered street (from the north). Fig. 11.16. Area H, the plastered street (from the east). The accumulation of surfacing and debris in the street reached a depth of at least 0.60 m. Most of this accumulation is due to the pebble foundations and the debris rather than the layers of mud plaster, which are usually 0.01-0.02 m . thick. A section cut into the street by a modern trench (H452) reveals the layers of surfacing (Figs. 11.18-11.19; see also Fig. 3.14). As some of the mud-plaster surfaces seen in the section are diagonally, rather than horizontally, above each other, they were probably patches in limited locations. This would attest to phases of localized mending rather than surfacing of large areas. These upper patches of plastering were attributed to Phase H-4A due to their elevation and their relation to the upper entrance of Building Complex I, while the debris and surfaces below them were attributed to Phase H-4B. In the northwestern part of the street (Squares CC41d- CC42c), an unplastered section nearly 5 m. long and 0.40 193</page><page sequence="210">CHAPTER 11 Fig. 11.17.

Fig. 1 1 .20. Area H, Drainage Channel H476 in the western part of the street (from the west). m. wide was revealed (H476, Fig. 11.20); it was filled with stones and debris rich in finds. This strip, at least 0.30 m . deep, narrows towards the bottom as if it were a channel (although the bottom was not reached). Moreover, the mud plaster lines the sides of the depression and is not cut by it. As daring as this interpretation may be for the Pottery Neolithic period, this feature appears to be some kind of drainage channel within the street. There are no exact parallels, though drainage channels inside houses are known from Çayônû (Braidwood et al . 1 98 1 ) . From the fourth millennium BCE, long ceramic drainage pipes were unearthed at Tell Brak (Emberling and McDonald 2003: 8, Figs. 8-10) and Habuba Kebira (Strommenger 1980: 46). A single row of stones, 4 m. long, lies in the southwestern part of the street (Squares CC41d-CC42c, H499), parallel to the northern wall of Building Complex III and resting partly on the plastered street surface. This could be either a constructional feature (a foundation?) of the upper phase of the street or an installation/utility wall in the lower phase of the street. This row of stones is aligned with another row of stones in the eastern part of the street (Square CC43c, H577), which was probably similar in nature. In the eastern part of the street, in Square CC43c, a rounded, plastered pit, 0.70 m. in diameter and 0.30 m. deep (H447), lies partly in the unexcavated area to the northeast. As the street's plaster lined this feature, it was an integral part of it (the material from within this locus contained only Yarmukian 194</page><page sequence="211">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA H finds). This feature too may belong to the drainage system of the street. BUILDING COMPLEX I (Figs. 1121-1123; Tables 11.4-11.5) Building Complex I, the only completely excavated structure in Area H, is a courtyard building comprising a large central courtyard (A) and ten rooms surrounding it (B-K). Since the Phase H-4A building was partially damaged, the Phase H-4B plan is the most complete. Nevertheless, the differences between the two phases are minor. The northern side of the building borders the street. The northern wall is long, (comprising Walls H399, H439 and H317), 0.60-0.80 m. thick, with stone foundations and some of the brick superstructure upon them (Figs. 11.13-11.15). In Phase H-4B the building is entered through this wall by way of a wide, paved and plastered threshold (H539, Fig. 1 1 .24). The plastered surface of the street is higher than the foundations of the walls of the building and the floor of the courtyard in the building is some 0.50 m. lower than the street level, since this is the courtyard floor of the lower phase. Furthermore, the accumulation of debris and resurfacing was more intensive on the street than inside the dwellings. On the east (Rooms H and I), Building Complex I adjoins Building Complex II, with a common north-south wall extending nearly 20 m. (comprising Walls H493, H380, H350 and H352; see Fig. 11.2). This wall is not well preserved and has a somewhat unusual winding course. On the west (Rooms B , C, D and E), the building adjoins Building Complex III (the common wall comprised of Walls H266, H188 and H389). On the south, Building Complex I borders open areas defined as Building Complex V, where the southern walls of Rooms E, F and G (Walls H249 , H23 1,H137,H111,H115 and H449-H526) define the southern wall of the building.

Area H, isometric reconstruction of Building Complex I. building are not exceptionally wide, possibly since three of them do not border streets but adjoin neighboring buildings. Building Complex I in Area H is similar in plan to Building Complex I in Area E, though slightly larger (26.2 x 17.7 m. with an area of 257 sq. m.). It forms an irregular quadrangle with a protrusion to the northeast and an indentation in the southwest. Other architectural similarities with the courtyard buildings of Area E are striking: at least three pairs of the rooms (B-C, D-E, F-G) comprise an unpaved room with an entrance from the courtyard and a paved room adjacent to it with no visible entrance (see details on rooms in Table 11.5), and the only entrance to the building is through a paved threshold into the courtyard, opposite a large, thick- walled broadroom (Room F). The entrance to the building The entrance into the northern part of Courtyard A during the lower phase, H-4B (Figs. 11.12, 11.23), was quite impressive, comprising a 2.1-m.-wide threshold paved with large flat stones (H539, Fig. 11.24) adjoining Wall H439 and connected to the mud-plaster floor in northern Courtyard A (H441). Both the threshold and the floor slope down into the courtyard. In the middle of Wall H439 is an intentional gap in the stones, 0.15 m. wide, perhaps some kind of drainage device. During the subsequent phase, H-4 A, there is a considerable change to the entrance into the building. It is divided into two sections, each 1-1.1 m. wide, by Wall H395, a l-m.-long wall built of two rows of upright stones with a fill in the center. The entrance itself is not paved with stones but mud plastered (Floor H437, Fig. 11.25). Thus, in Phase H-4A the entrance to the building was less impressive than the earlier entrance. 195</page><page sequence="212">CHAPTER 11 Fig. 11.22.

Area H, mud-plastered Floor H437 in entrance to Building Complex I (from the south). Courtyard A The central courtyard is the largest and most dominant element of the building, as in the courtyard buildings of Area E, since all the entrances to the rooms and to the building itself are through this courtyard. The courtyard is roughly rectangular in shape (12.5 x 7 m.) and surrounded by rooms on the west, south and east. Its area is 91 sq. m. (net floor area 82.5 sq. m.), comprising 49.5% of the net floor area of Building Complex I (35.4% of the total area of the building). Thus, the area of the courtyard is relatively somewhat smaller than that of Courtyard A of Building Complex I in Area E (60.5%). In general, the two phases, H-4B and H-4A, are observable 196</page><page sequence="213">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA H Table 11 .5.

In most cases, these phases are reflected merely in different floor levels, and only in several places can different installations or other architectural features be discerned. However, there are several places within Courtyard A where the lower Phase H-4B was not reached or not detected, and they are assigned to the general Stratum H-4. The most significant differences between the two phases are in the entrance area and in the southwestern corner (Space L). Both phases are characterized by installations, many probably hearths. The various flooring of the courtyard includes beaten earth, stone pavement, mud plaster, or pebble layers- some of which may be foundations of mud plastering (see Table 11.4). Fig. 11.26. Area H, general view of Space M in the courtyard of Building Complex I (from the west). The debris in the courtyard is relatively rich in finds, as is the courtyard in Area E. Phase H-4A: The entire courtyard of this phase was exposed (Fig. 1 1 .27). Large parts of the courtyard were paved with angular stones that served as a foundation for the floor (H287, Fig. 11.28; see also Fig. 3.5). In many areas the mud- plaster surfaces and installations of the upper phase were preserved: 1 Space L is a distinct feature of Phase H-4 A, an enclosed space in the southwestern corner of the courtyard, adjacent to Room D (Fig. 11.29). It is a rectangular area (2.6 x 1.4 m.) enclosed by Walls H200 and H204 and open towards the southeast. Wall H200 is parallel to Wall H190 of Room D and is built of two rows of large, flat upright stones with the inner part filled with earth (see Fig. 3.26). This wall closely resembles Wall H395 in the entrance to the building. Wall H204 comprises several large stones, one of which is a basalt basin in secondary use, placed upside down. 2 Hearth H 146, in the southeastern corner of the courtyard, is a relatively large rounded hearth, 1 m. in diameter, constructed of large flat sherds and medium-sized pebbles (see Fig. 3.18). It is remarkable that the technique of lining installations with large pottery sherds, reflecting a secondary use of pottery, appears in this early period. Nearby, rich concentrations of pottery were found (Fig. 11.30). 3 Stones H384, adjacent to Room I, are most probably part of the threshold of the room. 4 In the northern part of the courtyard , near the main entrance , 197</page><page sequence="214">CHAPTER 11 Fig. 1 1 .27. Area H, general view of the Phase H-4A surface of the courtyard of Building Complex I (from the north). Fig. 11.28. Area H, Stone Pavement H287 in the courtyard of Building Complex I. Hearth H320 is a square (lxl m.) installation made of burnt mudbricks and stones. 5 In the northeastern part of the courtyard, in Square BB43a, two stone concentrations (H306 and H307) are possibly hearths. 6 In the same area, a pebble floor level reaches Wall H493 from the west (H509, Fig. 11.31). A stone slab measuring 0.30 X 0.30 m . was embedded in the pebble layer. 7 Two patches of mud-plastered floors in the same vicinity (H536 and H547) are contemporary with Floor H509. 8 A little to the south, a circle of large, flat, rounded stones is another installation (H357, Fig. 1 1 .32), probably belonging to the upper phase of the courtyard. Phase H-4B: Not all the courtyard was excavated to the floor of this phase. In most places where the Phase H-4A features in the courtyard were dismantled, only debris layers accumulated on the Phase H-4B floor were uncovered. Only in the northeastern corner of Square BB43a were several installations discerned: 1 Adjacent to Room I on the north is an enclosed area within the courtyard, measuring about 1 .3 x 1 .25 m. (Space M, Fig. 11.26), where a fragmentary stone pavement (H521, Fig. 11.33) and a complete small jar were found (Fig. 11.34). The remains of bricks and lines of several stones to the Fig. 1 1 .29.

Area H, Rooms B, C and D of Building Complex I (from the east). of Building Complex I (Figs. 1 1 .36-1 1 .37) delineated by Walls H356 on the south, H331 on the west, H317 on the north and the slightly curved H314 on the east. The entrance to this room was not detected, nor was the floor level, which was probably of beaten earth. A concentration of stones in the southern part may be remains of an installation or fallen stones from the wall. Room C This is a small rectangular room adjacent to Room B (Fig. 11.36, center) delineated by Walls H323 on the south, H389 on the west, H356 on the north and H388 on the east. The entrance to this room was not detected. The eastern part of the room was covered with a thick mud-plaster floor over an area of ca. 1 .5 X 1 .5 m. In the upper phase, Floor H325 had a make- up layer, 0.15-0.20 m. thick, consisting of small pebbles and debris. As can be seen in Fig. 1 1 .36, the Phase H-4A floor was preserved to a higher level than the walls around it. The floor of the lower Phase H-4B had two plaster layers (H344 and H378, Figs. 11.38-11.40). The western part of Room C had a poorly preserved stone pavement (H368), attributed to the lower phase in the room. The small dimensions of Room C and its intensive plastering imply that it was probably used as a storage facility. Thus, Rooms B and C may be seen as a dwelling unit. However, neither room has a discernible entrance from the courtyard. Room D This is a large rectangular room delineated by Walls H253 on the southwest, H 188 on the northwest, H323 on the northeast and H190 on the southeast (Figs. 11.36 left, 11.41). The entrance to this room is from the courtyard and located near its eastern corner (through Wall H 190). The most prominent feature of the upper phase in Room D is a large ceramic pithos sunken into a pit dug from the upper floor level in the southern corner of the room (HI 93, Figs. 11.41-11.42; see also Fig. 3.19), similar to the large jar in Room R2 of Building Complex II in Area E (see Fig. 8.87). The Phase H-4A floor and the upper part of the pithos were not preserved, probably due to modern agricultural activities. Other remains of Phase H-4A preserved in Room D include a fragmentary stone pavement (H255) located in the southern part of the room, an installation or another fragmentary stone pavement (H206) adjoining the western Wall HI 88, a fragment of a stone wall or rectangular installation (H275) just north of the jar, and a row of stones (H240) adjoining Wall H 188, possibly a partition wall.

The floor consists of a stone pavement of large and medium- sized stones (H251a) that reaches the walls around it. There are considerable differences in the elevation of the floor level within the room (up to 0.35 m.), which is somewhat lower in the western part where the pavement is cut by a pit of Stratum H-3 (E223). It should be noted that traces of a fragmentary upper pavement were detected in Room E in the field. Rooms D and E are a typical pair of rooms forming a dwelling unit: Room D is larger, with no pavement, and entered through the courtyard, while Room E is smaller, with a stone pavement and no entrance. 201</page><page sequence="218">CHAPTER 11 Room F This is a large rectangular room, the largest in Building Complex I, located at its southern end (Figs. 11.44-11.45). It is delineated by Walls HI 15 on the south, Hill on the west, H126 on the north and H118 on the east. The walls of this room are relatively wide (0.90-1.10 m.) and several courses Fig . 1 1 .40 .

The entrance into the room, 0.80 m. wide, is from the courtyard through Wall H 126 and is marked by large stones perhaps serving as doorposts. Two large pottery fragments were discovered adjacent to the western side of the doorway (Debris H258, Fig. 11.46). In the southwestern corner of the room is a stone pavement measuring ca. 2 x 1 .5 m. (HI 28), and another stone concentration is located in the northeastern corner (HI 49). Otherwise, most of the room seems to have a beaten-earth floor. It should be noted that lower floor levels and the lower part of the walls were not reached in this room. This large broadroom with massive walls facing the courtyard and the entrance to the building was evidently the most important room of the building, very similar to Room C of Building Complex I in Area E. Room G This is a rectangular room adjacent to Room F in the southeastern corner of Building Complex I (Figs. 11.47- 11.48), delineated by Walls H526/449 on the south, HI 18 on the west, H346 on the north and H430 on the east. The western and northern walls are relatively massive. No entrance to this Fig. 11.42.

As the Phase H-4A floor was not fully dismantled, the lower floor level (Phase H-4B) was only partly uncovered in the eastern part of the room. It comprises a fragmentary stone pavement (H531) adjacent to Wall H430 and a line of three large, elongated stones to the north of it that may be part of this wall or the top of an earlier wall. In this room, Phase H-4A was much better preserved than in other rooms, and it is evident that significant changes took place in Room G between the two phases (Fig. 11 .49). In the south, Wall H449 replaces Wall H526 and narrows the room by 0.65 m. The Phase H-4A room measures 3.45 x 2.55 m. (floor area ca. 7.5 sq. m.), as compared with the Phase H-4B room, 4.1 x 2.55 (9.5 sq. m). In the upper phase, a paved floor (H475, Fig. 11.48) comprising carefully laid, small and medium-sized pebbles covers the northern two thirds of the room, while in the southern part there is a beaten-earth floor (H463). Rooms F and G also form a pair of rooms: Room F, entered through the courtyard and lacking a pavement, and Room G lacking an entrance and with a stone pavement. Room H This is a rectangular room on the eastern side of Building Complex I (Fig. 11 .50 left), delineated by Walls H 126/346 on the south, H268 on the west, H370 on the north and H352 on the east. The entrance into the room is from the courtyard, through the western Wall H268. Room I This is a rectangular room to the north of Room H (Fig. 11.50 center), delineated by Walls H370 on the south, H376 on the west, H386/387 on the north and H350 on the east. The entrance into the room is from the courtyard through the western Wall H376; its floor is of beaten earth (H374, possibly relating to Phase H-4B). Two constructional phases were noted in Room I. In the lower Phase H-4B, the northern wall (H387) is perpendicular to Wall H376 and built of two lines of stones carefully laid as headers. A floor level (H374) was identified and in the northern part of the room is a stone concentration (H385). In the upper Phase H-4A, Wall H386 was erected on top of Wall H387. This wall is not as well built and has a slight inclination to the north. A concentration of stones adjoining the upper courses of Wall H376 from the west (H384) was probably the threshold into the room from the courtyard, creating an entrance about 0.60-0.70 m. wide. The Phase H-4B entrance into the room is reconstructed according to the Phase H-4A threshold.

I are not a typical paired dwelling unit, as they are similarly sized and both have an entrance from the courtyard and a beaten-earth floor. Thus, this section of the building may have had a different function than other sections of the house. It should be noted that these rooms are built of relatively thin, poorly preserved brick or stone walls (0.40-0.50 m.), and in most cases the stone foundations were not reached. Fig. 11.46.

Wall H305 slopes down considerably to the south and the bricks in its northern part were preserved to a height of three courses. Wall H330 slopes down to the southeast and only one stone course was preserved. Wall H542, which separates Rooms J and K, was not preserved in the upper Phase H-4A. Excavation of this room encountered a technical problem, as the southern part was excavated in the 2000 season and was not recognized as an architectural unit since the bricks of the southern wall H330 were not preserved. The northern part of the room was excavated only three years later in the 2003 excavation season. Fig. 11 .49. Area H, the two phases in the southeastern corner of Room G of Building Complex I.

The upper phase was well preserved (Fig. 11.52), with several elements still in situ (Figs. 11.53-11.56). A concentration of elongated stones adjacent to the northern wall (H409) is possibly a hearth; near it another feature included a large elongated limestone and several smaller stones around it (H424). Somewhat to the west, a circle of stones was probably a hearth (H422) and next to it a beaten-earth floor was preserved with several large flat sherds and two animal ribs lying upon it (H418, Fig. 1 1 .57). As noted above, the eastern wall of Room J is entirely reconstructed in this phase. In the lower Phase H-4B, only a debris layer was excavated; the floor was probably of beaten earth. Room K This is a rectangular room in the northeastern corner of the building (Figs. 11.51 right, 11.58 foreground), delineated by Walls H493/561 on the southeast, H542 on the west, H399 on the north and H576 on the northeast. The entrance into the room from the courtyard is shared with Room J, through a passage between Walls H542 and H493 (the eastern wall of Fig. 11.53.

Building Complex I). Thus, Room K is not an independent space but is subordinate to Room J. The walls of this room were not preserved in Phase H-4A and only poorly preserved in the lower phase. An irregular, elongated, concentration of stones (3 m. long), probably a poorly preserved Stratum H-3 wall (Wall H524, Fig. 1 1 .9), may explain the state of preservation. This wall seems to cut other upper features in this room, such as Installation H553. The sediment in this area was dark brown, damp and fine-grained ("clayey"), possibly reflecting the agricultural topsoil. Although the upper phase (H-4A) in Room K was not well preserved, several features can be attributed to this phase. A rounded (0.50 m. in diameter) plastered installation (H553) is located exactly in the eastern balk of the square and was excavated in two stages (Fig. 11.59). It comprises a layer of mud plaster, 0.04 m. thick, lying on small pebbles. The western part of Room K is covered by a pavement, measuring 1 .5 x 0.85 m., of medium-sized basalt pebbles (H482). Since it lies partly above Wall H542, it is related to the upper phase. Two lines of stones (H423) possibly delimit this pavement from the east. In Phase H-4B, the eastern part of Room K (ca. 1 .8 x 1 .4 Fig. 1 1 .58 . Area H, Rooms J and K in Phase H-4B . At this stage of the excavation, Mortar H554 had been removed (from the east). m.) was paved with rounded, flat stones (H558, Fig. 11.60), probably delimited by a line of several stones to its north (H570). Between the stones, near a concentration of small stones (H555), a complete basalt mortar was found lying on its side (H554, Figs 1 1 .60-1 1 .61). A rounded concentration of stones, 0.50 m . in diameter, is partly plastered and is probably a hearth (H565). The latter two features possibly continued in use into Phase H-4A. Despite the somewhat strange location of Rooms J and K, forming an elongated protrusion in the northeastern corner of Building Complex I, this pair of rooms can be considered a typical dwelling unit. Room J is an unpaved room entered through the courtyard, while Room K is stone paved and entered through Room J. However, judging by the installations in Room K (such as the mortar and the hearth), it is unlikely that it served exclusively as a storage room, or at least not in the earlier Phase H-4B. BUILDING COMPLEX II Building Complex II is defined as the structure adjoining Building Complex I from the east. Only a narrow strip consisting of 1-3 m. of the western part of this structure was 207</page><page sequence="224">CHAPTER 11 unearthed . The remainder of the building lies below the fishpond embankment and the dirt road on it, presenting difficulties for further excavation of this building in the near future. This building extends over some 15 m. from north to south. From Square BB43c northwards, the excavated area seems to be part of an open area (perhaps a large courtyard?). A patch of mud- plaster floor was found in Square BB43c (H481), while several meters to the north a rounded concentration of burnt bricks and stones is probably a hearth (H512). In Square AA43a, Fig. 11.59. Area H, section of Phase H-4A Installation H553 in Room K of Building Complex I. Fig. 11.60. Area H, Mortar H554 and Stone Pavement H558 in Room K of Building Complex I, Phase H-4B. Fig. 11.61. Area H, close-up of Mortar H554 in Room K of Building Complex I. south of Wall H369, the excavated area was probably part of a rectangular room. A concentration of several burnt bricks and stones may be a hearth (H371). In the same space, but higher, a stone concentration (H487) represents an installation of the later Phase H-4A. The walls in Square AA43c, east of Room G of Building Complex I, are possibly connected to another structure in the south. Wall H498 to the south of Building Complex II may continue southwards and connect with Building Complex VI at the southern edge of the excavated area (Walls HI 21 and H 136). This reconstruction corresponds with the orientation of the walls, but needs corroboration from an enlargement of the excavated area. The relatively thick stone walls H404 and H498 create a right-angled corner of a space that continues into the southeastern unexcavated area. Wall H404 is higher than other elements in the western part of the square and thus reflects the upper Phase H-4A. Wall H498, a brick and stone wall nearly 1 m. wide whose western face slopes down southwards (Fig. 11.62), belongs not to Building Complex II but to a complex located in the southern part of Area H (Building Complex VI). Although Wall H464, adjoining Wall H430 of Building Complex I in the west, appears to connect to Wall H404 as the stones of this wall lie below the lower stones of Wall H404, it is attributed to Phase H-4B. Wall H498 existed in both phases. In the southeastern corner of Square AA43c, a concentration of angular stones and a limestone bowl and pestle in situ were uncovered (Surface H406, Fig. 11.63). BUILDING COMPLEX III Building Complex III is defined as the structure adjoining Building Complex I from the west (Fig. 11.64). In the area excavated in Squares AA41b and BB41b-d (ca. 50 sq. m.), an open area (Courtyard A) and a room (Room B) were defined. This building borders the street in the north (Wall H495), and although the entrance to the building was not discovered, it is most likely that this is another courtyard building with a large central courtyard entered from the street. As in Building Complex I, the floor levels and wall foundations inside the building are 0.35-0.55 m. lower than the upper, plastered street surfaces. Courtyard A The courtyard covers most of Building Complex Ill's excavated area. In the southern part of this courtyard (Square AA41b) is a stone pavement measuring 1.5 x 1.2 m. (H272), which was disturbed by later pits (H207 and H458, Stratum H-3) in its northwestern part. Here Wall H231, the southeastern wall of Room E of Building Complex I, continues to the southwest and separates the southern part of Courtyard A of Building Complex III from the open area in Building Complex V. To the north, in the large area excavated in Squares BB41b-d, a layer of pebbles (H302) was possibly a floor level. Room B This is a roughly rectangular room in the northeastern corner of the building, measuring 3 x 1 .9 m. with a floor area of 5.2 sq. m. It is delineated by Walls H327 on the south, H328 on the west, H495 on the north and the somewhat curved Wall H331 on the east. The entrance to the room is from Courtyard A, 208</page><page sequence="225">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA H Fig. 11.62. Area H, Wall H498 and Surface H406 of Building Complex II (from the east). Fig. 1 1 .63 . Area H, bowl and pestle on Surface H406 of Building Complex II (from the south). Fig. 11.64. Area H, general view of Building Complex III (from the north). through the northern part of Wall H328. The floor of the room is of beaten earth and upon it is a circle of elongated pebbles, probably a posthole (H332), located along the longitudinal axis of the room, about 1 m. from the northern wall. Walls H327 and H328 in the southwestern corner of Room B meet at an obtuse angle (ca. 120°), and a wall fragment in the courtyard (H333) adjoins this corner. BUILDING COMPLEX IV Building Complex IV is defined as the structure lying to the north of the plastered street (Squares CC41d, CC42c-d). Only a narrow 1-2.5 m. strip of the southern part of this structure was excavated (Fig. 11.14). The southern wall of the building bordering the street (Walls H456 and H436), nearly 18 m. long and 0.50-0.60 m. wide, runs east-west into the western and northeastern unexcavated areas. The wall is defined by the termination of the line of the plastered street on the south and by floor levels, a pavement and installations on the north. In most cases only the lower brick courses were unearthed; these were better preserved in the western part of the wall. The elevations of the wall and the elements inside Building Complex IV are lower than those of the plastered street surfaces for the same reasons given above in relation to Building Complex I. In the eastern part of the excavated area of Building Complex IV, a stone pavement of large, flat, densely packed pebbles (H538), measuring 2.45 x 0.9 m., continues into the northern balk. Although no walls were detected around this pavement, it probably belongs to a paved room of Building Complex IV. In Square CC41d, a concentration of several features lies on a floor level in this open area. A layer of clay, 0.80 x 0.55 m. and 0.03 m. thick, is either a floor or an installation (H459, Fig. 11 .65). This clay layer, which reaches Wall H456, is dark and relatively hard, as if it had been fired. Several stones to the north of Wall H456 are an installation or a wall fragment (H468), while a rounded concentration of large stones is probably an installation (H469, Fig. 1 1 .66). Just north of these is another concentration of five stones (H470), and to the east in Square CC42c, a floor level of small pebbles (H445), ca. 1 .7 x 1 .2 m., was very rich in finds. It is impossible to reconstruct the plan of Building Complex IV and no entrance was detected. Nevertheless, the western part of the building appears to be a large open area, as no walls were detected perpendicular to Wall H456 to divide this area into separate units. BUILDING COMPLEX V (Plan Fig. 4.67) Little is known of the area excavated to the south of Building Complex I, since Stratum H-4 was poorly preserved in this corner of the fishpond, from which large quantities of earth were removed to build the embankment (see Fig. 1 1 .1). As our efforts in Area H were concentrated on exposing Building Complex I, various features of Building Complex V were left unexcavated. In addition, the architectural elements in the southern part of Area H seem to be isolated and are difficult to interpret. Building Complex V is defined as most of the area to the south and southwest of Building Complex I (Fig. 11.68). At least two constructional phases were detected, although some 209</page><page sequence="226">CHAPTER 11 Fig. 11.65. Area H, Installation H459 in Building Complex IV. Fig. 1 1 .66.

Area H, general view of the southern part of the area (from the north). Fig. 1 1 .69. Area H, Wall H136 (from the south). of the upper remains were poorly preserved and do not provide a clear architectural picture. This complex comprises several large open areas and a paved room (Room H 176). Further excavations and enlargement of the excavation area are necessary to clarify the present fragmentary picture. It is quite possible that more than one building is represented here. In the upper phase of Building Complex V (H-4A), which was poorly preserved, a long wall extended over 10 m. (H134, Figs. 1 1 .68-1 1 .69) from the southwest to the northeast, cutting Walls H130 and H148 of the lower phase and canceling them. This wall probably connects to the southern wall of Building Complex I (Wall HI 15) and divides the open area of Building Complex V in a different manner from the lower phase. Several elements belonging to Phase H-4A lie in the northwestern part of Building V in Square AA41b-d. These include a rounded installation (0.60 m. in diameter), probably a hearth (H216), made of a layer of mud plaster 0.02 m. thick laid on a foundation of small pebbles 0.06 m.thick. Adjacent to it is a small, rounded pit containing several large stones (H252). About 2 m. to the west, a square area covered by mud plaster measures ca. 2 x 2 m. (H260), and in the same area is a layer of pebbles adjacent to Wall Hill of Building Complex I (HI 33). In the lower Phase H-4B , Building Complex V comprises a paved room to the south (Room H 176, Squares Z41b-d, Figs. 1 1 .70-1 1 .7 1 ) adjoined by Wall H 1 30 from the east. Further to the east, Wall H130 forms an obtuse corner with Wall H148 (Fig. 11.72). Wall H148 may continue further to the east and relate in some way to the walls of Building Complex II, although this point needs clarification. On the west, in Square AA41d, Wall H231 separates Building Complex V from Building Complex III. Another wall fragment (HI 66) is oriented at a right angle to Wall H23 1 at its western end and to Wall H210 at its eastern end. If these walls are connected, together they define Building Complex V on the southwest. A large open area was created in the space between Building Complex I in the north, Wall 23 1 and Wall 166 in the west, and Room H176, Wall H130 and Wall H148 in the south. Several elements were defined here, including two parallel rows of stones in the northern part (H234 and H238). These features exist only in the lower phase and their function is unclear 211</page><page sequence="228">CHAPTER 11 Fig. 1 1 .70. Area H, Room H176 (from the south). Fig. 11 .71 . Area H, Room H 176 (from the south). (possibly for drainage?). In the northeastern corner of Square AA41d, a concentration of stones may be a pavement (H263), and further to the east, in Square Z42b, a fragmentary Wall (HI 96) runs parallel to Wall H 148 but does not connect to any other feature. South of Room H 176, in Squares Z41d-Z42b, is another open area tentatively attributed to Building Complex V, although it may belong to a separate architectural complex. Elements in this area include a fragment of a north-south wall (H247), a small concentration of stones (H219) and a rounded pit (H236). Room H176 This is a rectangular room, 2.95 x 2.85 m., with a floor area of 12.5 sq. m. (Figs. 11.70-11.71). This room existed in both construction phases, although the upper phase was almost completely eroded. Only the eastern and western walls (H210 and H 124) survived to their full length and several stones are all that remain of the southern wall (H225). The room is paved with large and medium-sized stones attributed to Phase H-4B (Pavement H 176); only fragmentary remains of the upper pavement were discerned in the northern part of the Fig. 1 1 .72. Area H, Wall H148 (from the south). room (H227). Below Pavement H176, several flat stones may represent an even lower pavement (H256, not excavated). Two phases of the western wall of the room were observed: Wall H210a of Phase H-4B and, above it and slightly to the west, Wall H210 of Phase H-4A. In the southeastern corner of Room H176, fragments of Walls H154 and H155, lying above Wall H 124, are attributed to Phase H-4A. Wall H 154 is probably the eastern wall of the room, while Wall H155 forms a right- angled corner with it and is possibly aligned with Wall H 134. BUILDING COMPLEX VI At the southern edge of the excavated area (Square Z42c), two massive stone walls form a right-angled corner of a structure (Walls HI 21 and H 136, Fig. 11.69). This structure appears to continue southward and thus was designated Building Complex VI. As noted above, Wall H498 south of Building Complex II may potentially run southward and connect with this structure. The small area excavated within this building includes a fragmentary cobbled area (HI 07) possibly reaching Wall H 165. A fragmentary east- west stone wall that lies partly below Wall H 136 may represent an earlier constructional phase. 212</page><page sequence="229">CHAPTER 12 THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA N (TELL ABU NIMMEL) PURPOSE OF THE EXCAVATION The excavations in Area N, near the eastern edge of the site (see Fig. 1 .2), were the focus of the final season of excavation in 2004 for the following reasons: 1 On the basis of the surveys, the size of the site of Sha'ar Hagolan was estimated at 20 hectares (Miller 2002: Figs. 3.1-3.4). As a site of such a size would be one of the largest Neolithic sites in the world, we attempted to verify this estimate by conducting excavations over the widest range possible. The southwestern corner of the site (Areas C-D) had been excavated by Stekelis , exposing Yarmukian levels; Areas E and G of the new excavations were located on the central-southern edge; Area F yielding Yarmukian architectural remains, was opened in the northeast; and Area H was situated in the center of the northern side. The existence of Yarmukian finds in the northwestern corner was attested by a series of deep trenches dug by the kibbutz members. Thus, only the eastern and southeastern parts remained unexcavated, and it was yet to be proven that Yarmukian architectural remains extended into this area as well. The excavations at Tell Abu Nimmel confirmed that this area as well was within the boundaries of the Yarmukian site, substantiating the large size of the site. The finds include remains of massive architecture similar to that of the other areas. However, this area may have been near the outer edge of the site, judging by the large open areas that we uncovered. The material culture is typically Yarmukian, although further research may identify differences between this area and the more centrally located zones of the site. 2 Area N is located on a low mound, rising ca. 4 m. above the surrounding area (Fig. 12.1), known as Tell Abu Nimmel ("Mound of the Father of the Ant"). Since the local topography of the Jordan Valley is basically flat, did Tell Abu Nimmel represent a natural hill or was it the result of an accumulation of many settlement layers over the years? Since the surface surveys prior to the excavation produced only Neolithic artifacts, it was possible that here we would uncover an even thicker Yarmukian occupation, or perhaps earlier Neolithic phases such as PPNA or PPNB . Following the excavations, it became clear that Tell Abu Nimmel is not an anthropogenic tell and that the topography was indeed created by natural forces, probably floods of the Yarmuk River, and was of similar nature during the Neolithic period. 3 The area was severely damaged by its use as a military installation and a garbage dump, as well as its constant exploitation as agricultural land. We felt an obligation to test this location for future generations of researchers before it is completely destroyed. 4 In past decades, kibbutz members had collected many Yarmukian finds, including several figurines, in this area (most of them apparently from the vicinity of an irrigation trench to the southwest of the mound). For these reasons, and as this was the final excavation season at the site, it was decided to open a probe here and excavate down to virgin soil. STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE The mound itself is about 0.5 hectare in size and has a gentle western slope and a steeper eastern slope. On the highest point a military embankment was constructed by the Israeli army during the 1970s. The sediment for the embankment was taken from the western side of the mound, creating a depression there. To verify if there were still archaeological remains in this location, a small test pit (3 x 0.6 m.) was mechanically excavated. Following the positive results, a trench consisting of three squares each measuring 5 x 5 m. was opened adjacent to the military embankment, sloping down to the west. The axis of the trench was roughly perpendicular to the contour lines. Since Area N's orientation was dictated by the local topography it was not integrated into the site grid and the Fig. 12.1 .

Excavation of these three squares down to virgin soil revealed that the human accumulation here was 0.80-1 m. at most, and thus that the mound's topography does not reflect human activity but mainly a natural accumulation of river wash. As the excavation of the first three squares (Squares A2-A4) took only two weeks, we then enlarged the area to the east and south, creating a rectangle of 20 x 10 m. (eight squares, 200 sq. m.). Four main strata were discerned, from top to bottom: 1 Modern activities. 2 A Late Islamic cemetery. 3 A Yarmukian layer with two phases. The upper phase was severely damaged by modern activities and the cemetery; the lower phase was also damaged and its architecture fragmentary. 4 An earlier Yarmukian stratum (?) 5 Virgin soil of the Yarmuk River delta. STRATUM N-l: TOPSOIL AND MODERN MILITARY ACTIVITIES (Table 12.1) Modern military activities had significantly damaged the upper layers of Area N. This was especially noticeable in the upper (eastern) four squares (A3, A4, B3, B4), where the upper sediment, originating in the Yarmukian strata, was clearly not in situ. In Square A4, marks of a backhoe were visible as deep as 0.50 m. below the surface (Locus N68, elevation -209.05). The sediment in Stratum N-l contained mainly Yarmukian finds but also shell casings, machine-gun belts and nails. It was clearly a mixture of occupational debris, ri ver- wash sediment and modern artifacts created by the movement of Table 12.1 . Loci of Stratum N-l (for further details see Appendix 5).

This activity also destroyed the uppermost parts of the Islamic burials (see below). In the lower (western) four squares and the western half of Squares A3-B3, the effect of the army activities was less noticeable. Here, Yarmukian remains in situ were often just below the surface. However, in this lower area the upper phases were probably eroded to a great extent. The natural slope creates a 0.40 m. difference in elevation between the eastern and western edges of the excavation trench.

These remains, denoted as Stratum N-2, included five well-preserved skeletons, the remains of two additional fragmentary burials, the remains of a cist grave without human remains and a pit containing a pottery vessel. All the burials were found in a limited five- meter strip and in identical orientation, with the head to the west and the feet to the east (compass directions). 1 Burial N122. In the center of Square B3 were two adjacent, well-preserved burials (N122 and N119). Burial N122, apparently the remains of a cist grave, was covered by a row, 1 .7 m. long, of flat, elongated stones (N82, Fig. 12.4). The adult skeleton, in articulation, was lying on its side, with the head to the west and the face turned to the south. Several of the bones from the upper part of the skeleton were dislocated.

This burial was less than 0.50 m. to the south of Burial 122 and parallel to it. It was covered by two concentrations of large stones (N81 and N83, Fig. 12.5), probably the remains of the covering of a cist grave. Several slabs found on either side of the skeleton, including a grinding stone just to the west of the head, were remains of the cist-grave construction. The adult skeleton was well 215</page><page sequence="232">CHAPTER 12 Fig. 12.6. Area N, Burial N119 (from the south). Fig. 12.7.

Burials N122 and N119 were probably interred around the same time, as the skeletons were laid carefully side by side. However, the less well-preserved Burial N122 was apparently earlier, as two stones from Burial N119 cover the hand bones of Burial N122. ' 3 Burial Nili. About 2 m. north of the two previous graves a line of upright, elongated stones, 1.4 m. long, creates the southern wall of this cist grave (N73, Fig. 12.8). The northern wall of the grave and the eastern part of the burial were not preserved, as they were cut by modern activities. The skeleton was not well preserved, lying supine with the head to the west. 4 Burial N118 . This burial was uncovered in the northwestern corner of Square B4 with the head in Square B3. Several large stones found to the sides of the burial may be the remains of a cist grave. The adult skeleton was well preserved and lying supine, in articulation, the head to the west and facing south (Fig. 12.9). On the upper part of the right arm was a metal bracelet, in situ and intact. 5 Burial N 164 . The fifth grave was found in the northwestern corner of Square A4. An elongated concentration of stones Fig. 12.8. Area N, Burial Nili and Stones N73 (from the east). Fig. 12.9.

The adult skeleton was lying supine and only partially articulated, with the head to the west. The skull was dislocated and facing upwards; one of the hands was dislocated as well. 6 Burial N13 . In addition to the five relatively well-preserved burials, remains of two additional human burials were 216</page><page sequence="233">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA N (TELL ABU NIMMEL) Fig. 12.10. Area N, close-up of the sugar pot in Pit N 114. found. In the eastern part of Square A3 several long bones were uncovered (Burial N13). 7 Burial N72. In the southwestern corner of Square A4 were a skull and long bones. The upper part of the skull was not preserved. 8 Stones N107. To the south of Burial N72 in Squares B3- B4, an east-west line of upright, elongated stones, 2 m. long, may have been a wall of another cist grave. However, no human bones were discerned in association with this feature. 9 Pit N114. Near the northern balk of Square A3, a typical ceramic "sugar pot" (Fig. 12.10), dating from the medieval period (Stern 2001: 286, Figs. 7, 13), was uncovered. No burial was found, but as the pit is located at the edge of the excavation, the burial may be located further to the north. Although the burials were covered by soil containing mostly Neolithic artifacts, they themselves were devoid of burial goods, except for the single bracelet on the arm of Burial N118. The burial pits were impossible to identify since they were immediately backfilled with the same soil, and their upper part was cut by modern activities. The modern military activity probably also covered some of the burials with a layer of soil brought from lower parts of the mound. The date of the burials could be adequately established on the basis of their character. The identical orientation of the burials with the head to the west and the face to the south, the cist graves comprised of two lines of upright standing stones covered by large stones, and the lack of burial goods are all indicative of the Islamic period. In addition, the bracelet from Burial N118 can be dated to the 9th-10th centuries CE (A. Boas, pers. comm.). The burials in Area N are so far the only substantial evidence from the Islamic period at Sha'ar Hagolan, although several sherds dated to this period were recovered from topsoil sediments around the site. STRATUM N-3: YARMUKIAN REMAINS Stratum N-3 includes the Yarmukian remains lying below the modern activities of Stratum N-l and the Islamic burials of Stratum N-2 . As both these strata penetrated into the Neolithic layer, the Yarmukian architecture is very fragmentary and, in contrast to Areas E and H, it is difficult to reconstruct a plan of the structures here. In most places, two stratigraphie phases could be identified, denoted Phase N-3A and Phase N-3B. The architectural features were concentrated in the eastern part of the excavated area, while the western part was an open area. As the topography of Area N slopes from east to west, Stratum N-3A was preserved mainly in the eastern squares. Phase N-3A (Plan Fig. 12.11) Several fragmentary architectural remains were uncovered in Squares A4 and B4 . A north-south wall (Wall N 1 24 , Fig .12.12 foreground), 3 m. long and 0.60 m . thick, was uncovered in Square A4. This wall was severely damaged by modern activities and cut in the north by Burial N164. A group of five stones in Square A3 (N21) may have been a continuation of this wall. To the east, a well-preserved mud-plaster floor measuring nearly 3.5 x 2 m. (N147, Figs. 12.12-12.13) was made of several layers of mud, each 0.05 m. thick; the floor reached Wall N124 in a number of places. This is probably the largest area of mud-plaster floor to be preserved at Sha'ar Hagolan. The rounded Pit N 141, 1.2 m. in diameter and 0.60 m. deep, was dug from this phase and filled with stones and artifacts (Fig. 12.14). In Square B4, two single lines of stones create a right angle (Walls N70 and Wall N92, Figs. 12.15-12.16); Wall N70 is 1.5 m. long and N92 is 1 m. long. Judging by the proximity of Pit N 141, they were probably not part of a room but rather an area defined by partition walls. Several concentrations of stones were possibly installations and wall fragments relating to the same phase; they include the rounded Installation N74 and Stones N93 (Fig. 12.17). Stones N56 adjoin the corner of Walls N70 and N92, while Stones N90 and N91 are located to the southeast. Two parallel concentrations of stones (N54 and N55, Fig. 12.15) are probably fragments of east- west walls about 1 m. apart. Wall N55, of which two courses were preserved (Fig. 12.18), may have been aligned with Wall N 124. These features may represent several constructional phases, but due to the poor preservation a more detailed stratigraphy cannot be determined. Near the southern balk of Square B4 a concentration of stones (N85), 1.5 m. wide, could have been a rounded pit continuing into the unexcavated area. In the southwestern part of the square, a layer of debris and pebbles represents a floor foundation (N58, Fig. 12.19). This layer continues into Square B3 but is preserved only in patches (N86 and N79, near the southern balk). The lower part of a basalt mortar (N80) was found embedded in a cobbled floor (N86, Fig. 12.20). Another concentration of stones south of Mortar N80 may be a poorly preserved wall (N129). The four western squares and the western half of Squares A3 and B3 were probably an open area. Stratum N-3A was more eroded in this lower part, and as a result it was difficult to distinguish between the two Yarmukian phases lying on the ri ver- wash sediment (especially in Squares Al and Bl). Nevertheless, higher debris levels rich in large rounded stones were assigned to Phase N-3A, as were a few other features, including a group of stones and sherds in the southeastern 217</page><page sequence="234">CHAPTER 12 Fig. 12.11. Area N, plan of Phase N-3A. corner of Square B2 (N98) and a concentration of mudbricks in the western part of Square A2 (N19). In summary, the remains of Phase N-3 A represent domestic architecture in the eastern part of the area, although its exact nature is unclear. It may have been a large open courtyard with various installations. A structure may have been situated in the northeast, represented by Wall N124 and Floor N147, which are the most substantial architectural remains of this phase. The western squares were an open area outside the structures, characterized by an accumulation of refuse. Phase N-3B (Plan Fig. 12.21) Phase N-3B was defined in most places as the earliest Yarmukian phase, deposited on natural ri ver- wash sediment (Fig. 12.22). As in the later phase, most architectural features are concentrated in the eastern squares and are somewhat 218</page><page sequence="235">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA N (TELL ABU NIMMEL) Fig. 12.12.

Area N, Wall N55 (from the south). better preserved than the Phase N-3A remains, although still fragmentary in nature. In Square B4, two walls create a rectilinear feature. Wall N1 35 , 3 m. long and lying in the eastern balk, is oriented north- south, while east-west Wall N142, 4.1 m. long and 0.50-0.60 Fig. 12.19.

Area N, Mortar N80 and Cobbles N86 (from the north). m. thick (Fig. 12.23), adjoins it at a right angle. Wall N142 continues to the west but is cut by Burial N118. A large basalt bowl (N168) attached to the northern face of Wall N142 could be an installation or be in secondary use in the wall. To the southeast, a curved line of stones adjoining Wall N135 (N105, Fig. 12.24) is probably an installation or the boundary of a pavement. Several fragmentary walls in Squares A3 and B3 may be related to the architectural unit formed by Walls N135 and N142. In Square A3, Wall N28 is 1.8 m. long and 0.55 m. thick, and is oriented north-south. It was cut by the Islamic Pit N 114 in the north, while its southern end slopes down and is delimited (or cut?) by a basalt grinding stone, 0.45 x 0.25 m., lying flat in situ on the floor (N33, Figs. 12.25-12.26). From the east, a patch of pavement (N32), ca. 1 x 0.5 m., made of small angular pebbles, slopes down westward and reaches Wall N28. To the west and exactly parallel to Wall N28, Wall N23 is 1.5 m. long and 0.8 m. thick and made of two lines of large stones laid as stretchers with an inner fill of smaller stones (Figs. 12.27-12.28). This wall resembles the massive walls defining the courtyard buildings in Areas E and H, but is apparently only partly preserved, being cut in the south by 220</page><page sequence="237">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA N (TELL ABU NIMMEL) Fig. 12.21. Area N, plan of Phases N-3B and N-4.. Burial Nili. In Square B3, a fragmentary north-south stone wall is 1.4 m. long (N130); its eastern face was destroyed by Burial N118, while its northern end was cut by Burial Nili. Three rounded stones at its southern end may be the remains of a corner and patches of mud-plaster floor reach it from the west (N123). This wall could have been the southern continuation of Wall N23, although they are not precisely aligned. The stratigraphie relationship between Walls N23 and N28 and Grinding Stone N33 is not entirely clear. While the parallel orientation of these two walls and their similar elevations seem to imply they are of the same constructional phase, they are only 0.40 m. apart, leaving a very narrow passage (perhaps an alley?). A tentative interpretation could be that Wall N28 is related to an eastern structure, together with Walls N135 and N142, while Walls N23 and N130 relate to a western structure or feature. Square A4 seems to have been an open area or courtyard. A patch of mud-plaster floor was discovered below Floor N147 of Phase N-3A (N156), and a pit 0.80 m. wide was 221</page><page sequence="238">CHAPTER 12 Fig. 12.22.

An elongated patch of mud-plaster floor, 3 m. long and 0.4-0.7 m. wide, was preserved near the southern balk of Square B3 (N161) and continues into the balk. Installation N162 reaches Floor 161 from the east and continues into the southern balk. It is at least 1 x 0.7 m. in area, comprising large stones creating a semicircle, small stones between and around them, and remains of mud plaster within. Adjacent to it from the east in Square B4 is Installation N158, at least 1 m. wide and similarly comprising a curved line of rounded stones and 222</page><page sequence="239">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA N (TELL ABU NIMMEL) Fig. 12.25.

Area N, Grinding Stone N33, with an upper grinding stone found nearby placed on top of it. several bricks attached from the south. These features are difficult to interpret as they lie largely in the unexcavated area; they seem to be part of a large open area. The lower, western squares, Al , A2, B1 and B2, and most of Squares A3 and B3, represent a large open area outside the buildings. The debris layer here lies immediately on top of the natural ri ver- wash sediment, and is often very rich in pottery, flint, animal bones and charcoal (Fig. 12.29). In several places there were layers of small pebbles indicating a floor foundation Fig. 12.27.

Area N, Hearth N35 (from the south). (e.g., Locus N26 in Square AI). In Square A2, a rounded hearth, 0.60 m . in diameter, was built of small, closely packed pebbles (N35, Fig. 12.30); a similar hearth was uncovered about 2 m. to the west (N155). In the vicinity of Hearth N35, a patch of mud-plaster floor measuring 0.8 x 0.6 m. (N42) was identified. In Square B2, a concentration of sherds and charcoal may represent a fireplace (N159); a similar concentration containing animal bones was found in the southwest of Square Al (N44). In the southwestern corner of Square Al a large stone surrounded by small pebbles was possibly a grinding installation or an anvil (N34). A concentration of artifacts, charcoal and a scapula in the northeastern corner of Square B1 may have been a rounded pit, 1 m. in diameter (N154, Fig. 12.31). Other concentrations of stones in Square B1 may also have been pits (N 1 1 3 , N 1 32) , although their contours were not well defined. An interesting find in Area N is lumps of mud with imprints of straw on one side (see Fig. 3.17), which probably originate from the straw and mud roofs of the buildings . They comprise the first direct evidence of roofing techniques at Sha'ar Hagolan. In summary, Phase N-3B includes part of a structure in the eastern squares (mainly B4), which may have defined a Fig. 12.29. Area N, Squares Al and A2 from the west, showing mainly ri ver- wash sediment. Fig. 12.31. Area N, scapula in Pit N154. room or courtyard of a building. To the northeast, the scanty remains could belong to a different structure or an open area. A large open area, covering most of the excavation trench, lies to the west. Here, fragmentary walls and several features such as hearths, pits and floors were identified, as well as a rich accumulation of refuse. STRATUM N-4: EARLIEST YARMUKIAN REMAINS Although the remains of Phase N-3B were seen to lie upon the natural ri ver- wash sediment in most places, especially in the eastern squares, the possibility of an earlier Yarmukian occupation phase (denoted Stratum N-4) cannot be dismissed. Along the eastern balk of Square B4 (near Wall N135), a 0.75 x 0.75 m. probe was excavated (N165, Fig. 12.23). Although the probe reached levels at least 0.60 m. below the Phase N-3B walls, Yarmukian finds mixed with mudbrick material were still evident. This could be explained if the sediment were the fill of a large pit whose limits were not identified, belonging to a phase predating the architectural remains. Other possible indications of such a phase are a deep oval pit (1 x 0.75 m.) in Square B3 (N166) and debris cutting deep into the river-wash sediment in Probe N43 in the northwestern Square AI (Fig. 224</page><page sequence="241">THE STRATIGRAPHY AND ARCHITECTURE OF AREA N (TELL ABU NIMMEL) 12.32). A Neolithic phase comprising large, deep pits dug into the river wash was also uncovered in Area G (Stratum G-ll). STRATUM N-5: NATURAL ALLUVIAL BED (RIVER WASH) The Yarmukian occupation in Area N lies on the natural alluvial sediment of the Yarmuk River bed (Stratum N-5; N169, Fig. 12.32). The sediment contains rounded, unsorted river pebbles and basalt pieces in a dark brown matrix, similar to that in Areas E and G (Strata E-8 and G-13). Although this , layer was reached in the two westernmost squares (Al and Bl), the slope of the layer may be reversed further east, as it was not reached in the excavation of the eastern squares (A3, A4, B3 and B4).
