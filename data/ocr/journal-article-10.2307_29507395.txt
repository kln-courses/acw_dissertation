To assess the extent of bone loss and the influence of corticosteroid treatment total body calcium was measured by in-vivo neutron activation analysis in 63 patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone and 31 treated with additional low-dose corticosteroids. The results were compared with those in 40 normal controls matched for age, sex, and menopausal state. There were significant reductions in mean total body calcium in the group treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (5 3% in men; 6 8% in women) and greater reductions in the corticosteroid-treated patients (11-5% in men, 15 5% in women). The reduction was correlated with disease duration and activity in the patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone. Measured total body calcium was signifi? cantly less than the values predicted when this relation was used in the corticosteroid-treated patients. The data suggest that increased bone loss in patients with rheuma? toid arthritis treated with corticosteroids is attributable to drug treatment rather than disease activity. Many patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with low-dosage corticosteroids and some postmenopausal women with the disease are likely to be at risk from the complications of osteoporosis. Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis is thought to be associated with generalised12 as well as periarticular osteoporosis, but considerable uncertainty exists regarding the extent of bone loss and its relation to the duration of disease, disease activity, and additional corticosteroid treatment. Most previous studies of osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis have used radiological or photon absorptiometric methods.2 These techniques have the disadvantage of using single bone sites and may be particularly misleading in a disease associated with severe and variable localised periarticular osteoporosis. The only accurate method of measuring total bone mass in vivo is to measure total body calcium using neutron activation analysis.3 To assess bone mass in rheumatoid arthritis and its relation to duration of disease, disease activity, and drug treatment we measured total body calcium in sizable groups of patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone and with additional corticosteroids and compared the results with those obtained in controls matched for age, sex, and menopausal state. Subjects and methods We measured total body calcium in 63 patients (29 men, 34 women) with definite or classical rheumatoid arthritis4 treated with non steroidal anti-inflammatory agents alone and in 31 patients (nine men, 22 women) who were receiving in addition low-dosage corticosteroids (&lt;10 mg prednisolone/day) (see table). The results were compared with those from 40 normal control subjects (20 men, 20 women).5 Serum calcium, phosphate, and protein concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activity were measured in all subjects, and those with abnormalities of calcium metabolism or medical conditions associated with secondary osteoporosis were excluded. Total body calcium was measured by in-vivo neutron activation analysis. Patients were irradiated for 20 seconds from front and back, while standing in a rigid polyethylene activation enclosure, using neutrons from the Edinburgh MRC cyclotron. They were then transferred to a shadow shield whole-body counter, where the gamma radiation from calcium-49 induced from stable calcium-48 by neutron capture was measured for 20 minutes. The patient's total body calcium (in grams) was calculated by comparison with the energy spectrum from an activated anthropomorphic phantom containing a known quantity of calcium. Repeated measurements of the phantom gave a long-term precision of 1-8% for a radiation dose of 13 mSv (1-3 rem). Mean total body calcium ( =b 1 SD) in the control population was 1142-7 ? 133-8 g in men and 820-5 ? 124-5 g in women. Individual results were expressed as a percentage of the expected normal value for the patient's skeletal size (arm span) and menopausal state. The spread in the normal range was 7-8% in male controls and 6-5% in female controls.5 Clinical assessments undertaken at the time of measurement of total body calcium included measurements of articular index,6 functional state,7 Westergren erythrocyte sedimentation rate, duration of early morning stiffness, and rheumatoid factor titre.8 Statistical analysis of results was performed using Student's t test for unpaired variables and by multiple linear regression analysis. The Mann-Whitney test was used for data not normally distributed and for small samples. All patients gave informed consent, and ethical approval was obtained from local and national committees. Results The table shows details of age, duration of disease, variables of disease activity, and corticosteroid dosage in the patients studied. Comparison of the results obtained in the control and patient groups (fig 1) showed a significant reduction in mean total body calcium in patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone (men 5-3%, p&lt;0-05; women 6-8%, p&lt;0-01). Mean total body calcium was further reduced in patients receiving low-dosage corticosteroids compared with controls (men 11-5%, p&lt;0-01; women 15-5%, p&lt; 0-001) and in women receiving low-dosage corticosteroids com? pared with those receiving only non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (8-7%, p&lt;0-02). In patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs total body calcium was not significantly correlated with any single index of disease activity or duration. Multiple linear regression analysis, however, showed a weak but significant correlation between total body calcium and a composite index of articular index, functional state, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor titre, and duration of disease (r=0-34, p&lt;0-01) in 56 patients who had not received gold.

When the equation obtained by multiple linear regression analysis in patients receiving only non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was used the mean total body calcium in patients receiving additional corticosteroids predicted from the duration of disease and variables of disease activity was found to be 93-6?3-7% (range 87-5-102-3%). This was significantly higher (p&lt; 0-005) than the measured value in this group and similar to the measured value (93-2?10-9%) formen and women in the group taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents alone. No significant differences were found in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, functional state, and rheumatoid factor titre between the group receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone and additional corticosteroids, although the duration of disease was 25% higher (p &lt;0-02) and the articular index 20% lower (p &lt;0-05 in the group receiving corticosteroids. In patients receiving corticosteroids total body calcium was closely correlated with the mean daily dose of prednisolone (r=?0-66, p&lt; 0-001) (fig 2) but not with duration of treatment or the total steroid dose (daily dose x duration of treatment). Discussion These studies show a significant reduction in mean total body calcium in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had not received corticosteroid drugs and strongly suggest that the reduction in bone mass is an integral feature of the disease. The only previous studies of total body calcium in patients with rheumatoid arthritis showed conflicting results. In a small preliminary study Zanzi et al9 found no reduction in seven women who had not received corticosteroids, while Kennedy et al10 found an 18% reduction in 32 women compared with hypertensive controls. No details of drug treatment preceding the study were given in the latter paper. By using localised methods of skeletal measurement several previous studies have suggested a relation between bone loss and duration of disease in rheumatoid arthritis,11-13 while others have been unable to confirm this.14-16 Most studies in which radiological or absorptiometric methods have been used, however, have suggested a relation between bone loss and variables of disease activity including erythrocyte sedimentation rate13-15 and rheumatoid factor titre.13 Unfortunately, there is no good method by which overall disease activity over a period of time can be assessed. The composite index used in this study included the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and rheumatoid factor titres as indicators of disease activity at the time of measurement of total body calcium as well as functional state and duration of disease, which also reflect the clinical state over a prolonged period. Although the correlation between total body calcium and the composite index of disease duration and activity in patients who had not received corticosteroid treatment was relatively weak, it did permit total bone mass in the steroid-treated patients to be predicted. The striking discrepancy between measured and predicted total body calcium in the steroid-treated group suggests that loss of bone mass in these patients is directly attributable to the drug treatment and not a function of more prolonged or severe under? lying disease. Some previous studies using less sophisticated methods have failed to show a relation between osteoporosis and corticosteroid treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis,111517 and it has been suggested that low-dosage treatment may be free from this risk and that improved mobility attributable to the use of corticosteroids may have the effect of reducing bone loss. Most studies, however, have shown evidence of increased bone loss in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with corticosteroids,91618 although this has not been correlated with steroid dosage. The finding that daily cortico? steroid dosage is correlated with reduction in total body calcium while duration of corticosteroid treatment is not is consistent with the hypothesis that the histochemical changes and catabolic effects of corticosteroids on bone are most pronounced early in the course of treatment.19 20 Previous measurements of total body calcium in women with symptomatic postmenopausal osteoporosis have shown mean reductions of 16 and 18% greater than expected values.3 21 This would seem to suggest that despite low mean daily doses of prednisolone (men 61 mg; women 6-3 mg) some male patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with corticosteroids (mean reduction in total body calcium of 11-5%) and many female patients (mean reduction 15-5%) are at risk of osteoporotic complications. As a group patients treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs alone, with a mean reduction in total</page><page sequence="3">332 BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL VOLUME 285 31 JULY 1982 body calcium of only 5-3% in men and 6-8% in women, are probably not at high clinical risk of complications of osteoporosis. Since, however, the range of the reduction was wide (?20% to + 12% in men; ?33% to +19% in women) and many patients with rheumatoid arthritis are postmenopausal women, probably many individual patients who have not received corticosteroids will sustain clinically important reductions in skeletal mass. Although there has been an isolated report of spontaneous fractures in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had not received corticosteroids,22 there is clearly a need for epidemio logical studies of the incidence of fracture in patients with this disease. These studies also suggest that it will be important to try and establish the pathological basis of reduced bone mass in patients with rheumatoid arthritis as well as to determine to what extent this is the result of local and generalised osteoporosis.
