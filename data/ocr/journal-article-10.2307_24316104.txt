The greater part of Teotihuacan pottery has been found in graves or in sacrifical offerings to the gods. Generally the latter are found in the rubble of ruined patios and rooms or buried beneath floors, where they are often recovered intact. Shards are also found embedded in masonry walls and in the middens which represent the accumulated debris of a living city. No tombs have been uncovered in Teotihuacan; the burials consist of gra ves dug in the fill of a temple platform or beneath the pavement of floors and patios or in the tepetate subsoil. Only occasionally are they covered with rough stone slabs. Cremation was frequent and in such cases a charred bun dle is found, together with its offerings usually consisting of jars in many forms, masks, ear ornaments and necklaces of jadeite or marble. Clay from the San Juan arroyo or from nearby villages was the raw mate rial for the potters of Teotihuacan from which they produced articles or rare elegance and beauty. An orange colored clay of special consistency and cohesiveness which permitted the production of paper-thin ware and elegant designs was also imported. Chronologically Teotihuacan ware has been classified in horizons known respectively as Late Pre-Classic, Classic and Post-Classic. The earliest period is from 200 B.C. to 150 A.D.; the Classic Period, when the city was at its ze nith, runs from 150 to 750 A.D.; and the last period covers the city's decline up into the ninth century when Teotihuacan ceased to be a settlement of any importance. It is at the close of the first period that ceramics acquire a great importance and become the expression of an unregimented artistic impulse, full of life and color, which later was stifled by the rigid dictates of a theocra tic rule. In the vessels of this" early period the most common forms are the biconical bràziers painted in a faded pink and decorated with attached lozenges and three-footed bowls with straight sides. The use of color, either singly or in combination is very characteristic as well as the process of negative glazing which involved an underglaze, the subsequent painting of the design on the object in wax and then the complete coating of the vessel with a second con trasting glaze. When fired the wax burned away and with it the pigments adhering to it, so that the vessel emerged with the design displayed in the color of the underglaze against the "background" of the contrasting overgla ze. The colors commonly chosen are white or dark red on brown or black on red or yellow. In this period the geometrical style is predominant with the designs appearing in horizontal bands. Figurines in human form were originally hand moulded and un bur nished. Bodies are bare and wide and flat with short arms and legs while faces are often markedly prognathous, with attached eyes the size of a coffee bean and attached ornaments such as clay bracelets and headdresses in the shape of simple headbands. Later the bodies become more slender and rounded; faces are flattened; prognathism disappears and headdresses become larger and more ornate; and figures are found exhibiting obvious physical defects. Zoomorphic forms are usually whistles. Birds, monkeys and even at times the human foot is copied. From this period the emergence of a strong religious ritual is foreshad owed. 98 Representación del viejo dios del fuego. —Representation of the Old Fire God.

Two new styles emerged to displace the early geometrical style with its rich variety of designs. These were the naturalistic and the symbolic styles. The naturalistic is remarkable for its wealth of designs: animals, plants, marine life, people, human scenes and many familiar objects. Some of its most interesting features are the stylized serpents, the finely drawn plumes of the eagles, four-petaled flowers, conch shells and the earliest scenes with people in movement. In the second, or symbolic, style we have, in addition to the representa tions of such gods as Xipe, Tlaloc and Quetzalcáatl, the cloud symbol, the cloverleaf with drops of blood and the Teotihuacan yearly cycle. Pottery vessels are commonly of one color, brown or violet-black, and the burnishing is of the highest quality. However, two-toned work in red on light brown or white on red is still encountered. New forms emerge: a bra zier in two or three sections, a pot with the figure of Tlaloc, a slender flower vase with a turned down lip suggesting a flower, a cup with a spout and a three-footed cylindrical cup. The famous thin ware appears for the first time in the form of a cup and is quickly followed by a variety of objects of great beauty and artistic value. Figurines are still hand, made; the head is broadened with heart-shaped faces or receding foreheads. The figures are clothed to distinguish the sexes, with a cape and skirt for women and a belt and breechclout for men. The so-called portrait style begins to appear: figures are depicted as bound with cords or seated on logs and there are mothers with babies in their arms. Among the animal figures, in addition to birds and monkeys we find toads and toy dogs mounted on wheels. The pantheon of the gods of Teotihuacan is increased and Xipe is rep resented with a headband. In passing from the Early to the Late Classic we find single colors pred ominating in pots and vessels in all shades of brown and in red and yellow red. The two-toned work practically disappears and only a combination of red on a light brown or black background remains. Very elegant and richly detailed designs now appear. The biconical bra zier is provided with a base decorated with attractive human or animal fig ures which are decorated with rich plumes, flowers, butterflies and even cir cles. Four color combinations are used and later occurs a richly decorated altar type brazier used in the worship of the fire god. Especially remarkable are the beautiful three-footed vessels with lids and the pots in the shape of ~ - nm Huehueteotl. Dios del fuego.—Huehue teotl, the Fire God.

There are funeral masks in the special colors sacred to each god and the finest of all are the large cere monial vases with the representations of ceremonial rites on their elegant ba ses. In this period there is no pretense to realistn in the treatment of figurines and the techniques of manufacture have changed. The heads and bodies are made in moulds and the arms and legs are hand shaped and attached, after which the figurines are painted with the color of the god to whom they are to offered in sacrifice. One type of statuette of this period which has attracted much attention is provided with a cavity in its body in which a smaller figure can be placed. At the close of the period rank and status acquière importance as is shown by representations of armored or helmeted warriors and enthroned persona ges. Xochiquetzal (the Monkey God), Itzalcohuique (the Knife God) and pos sibly Xochipilli are now admitted into the pantheon. Although during this period the geometrical style continues to dominate, the two other styles continue to develop. The realistic style is enriched with representations of the peccary, the owl, the serpent, the quetzal, the coyote, the butterflly and finally a monstruous jaguar-serpent. In the vegetable kingdom portrayals of squashes, water plants, many kinds of flowers, beans and cotton and cacao seeds are found. Marine motives are provided by sea shells, conches, starfishes and clams. Humanistic themes are found in ball players, warriors, clasped hands and priestly processions and rites. The symbolic style is enriched with portrayals of forests, two-headed ser pents, speech and song glyphs and the reptilian eye associated with fire. At the end of the Classic Period decadence is revealed by fewer colors, which are mostly shades of brown. Technique is clumsy and careless with lit tle inventiveness in shapes and only two new techniques: stamped designs and others scraped out with hematite. Figurines are made in moulds and have triangular faces and a style of dress characterized by an abundance of feathers, flowers, fringes and other adorn ments. Practically all the gods have been admitted to the pantheon, except the Fat God, who is even more popular than Tlaloc and at the end of the period representations of skulls, perhaps related to the worship of Mictlantecutli, appear. It is worth noting that the geometrical style begins to develop new elements although the execution is faulty, but this style will continue to dominate the Post-Classic, or Historic Period. The naturalistic style has fallen from favor and only retains the motives of the jaguar-bird-serpent monster, the head of the feathered serpent and the procession of priests cele brating the rites of Tlaloc. Of the symbolic style only the representations of clouds, running water and springs persist. We cannot close this review of Teotihuacan ceramics without a mention of domestic utensils, which show an elegant simplicity and restraint. They are decorated in brown, red, black or white, and yellow red. The most com mon objects are baking pans, dishes, dish covers, stewing pans, pots and bra ziers decorated with small human faces. Although the Teotihuacan potters were bound a rigid religious mystique, they found models in things close at hand. In the geometrical style they found spirals and circles in basketwork, while lines, bands, squares, triangles, friezes and links were borrowed from textiles. The naturalistic style is based on local fauna and flora as well as that of the tropical coast. The influence of coastal cultures is seen in the use of monkeys, jaguars, cotton, cacao, water plants, conch shells and starfish as motives. In the symbolic school the religious pressures are more obvious, especially in scenes containing a series of grotesque and formal symbols which in context with certain ritual objects would appear to be coded mnemonic aids to per forming ceremonies. This suggests that the culture of Teotihuacan had reached the pictographic stage. 101</page><page sequence="5">Almena. Quetzal con corrientes de agua. Barro café claro.—Light brown clay mer lon.
