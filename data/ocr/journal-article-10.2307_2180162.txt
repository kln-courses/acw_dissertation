<plain_text><page sequence="1">La critique et la religion chez David Hume. Par ANDRE' LEROY. Paris, Felix Alcan, 193I, PP. xx, 378. This book is a fine and very adequate treatment of its subject. The author is in accord with those who regard Hume's critical thought as centered about the question of religion, and he develops farther than anyone has yet done the position which is a consequence of that point of view. "All the rest of this work will show that Hume was very specially preoccupied with the religious problem; for that orienta- tion of thought, two causes can be assigned, one peculiar to Hume which the preceding pages have tried to show in its full value-that at the moment when Hume was studying, the mode was one of religious controversy-the other general, that the religious problem is, in the last analysis, the sole philosophical problem, and the solution we give to it decides all other particular solutions" (204). And this book thus becomes an interpretation of the philosophy of Hume as a whole. The first chapter, which represents an exemplary piece of historical study, deals with the influences making for that religious "orientation of thought". We are shown what it was Hume assimilated in his "studious adolescence", the ideas, the attitudes, the interests, and the habits of critical discussion. A certain concordance is observed in the effects of the various writings he had studied, which discloses his thought already in some kind of formation, though only expressed, as it were, in the choice of his reading. Cicero with his Academic method of reasoning; Lucretius and his "Epicurean hypothesis"; Plutarch, agnostic in regard to reason, yet talking naively about an intuition of the divine; Montaigne who dwelt on the vanity of reason and nevertheless spoke, apparently without any dishonesty, as if faith or revelation might have some meaning; Bayle (very deservedly re- ceiving most attention from the author) who possessed a most seduc- tive "dialectical virtuosity", who expounded both demonstrations of God and reasonings of an "experimental" nature, who dexterously weighed alternative hypotheses, and particularly that of Strato which attributed order eternally to nature and thus posited the very uniform-</page><page sequence="2">422 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. ity for nature which all empirical reasoning presupposes; and yet who argued, too, that this very order, especially in organic systems, seemed unintelligible without the theistic hypothesis of an intelligent author- thus Bayle made his points pro and con, and in sum, established at least this, that human reason is inconclusive and only by revelation can one make a decision. M. Leroy felicitously recalls how germane to these questions were the ideas of Lucian whose pleasantries Hume never ceased to enjoy. It is further shown what attracted Hume in Fontenelle, his "scientific rigour and elegance"; and in Fenelon, his skill in "abstract dialectic" with the ontological argument and against the notion of matter having intrinsic forces of organisation. By all these divers influences the youthful Hume was made to be critical, and critical not only of theism but also of a materialism which went beyond the experimental reasoning and attributed powers to matter and talked about "necessity" as if it were entirely intelligible to the mind of man. Hume the critic was thus formed, a person even more thoroughly sceptical than those who gave him his first lessons in scepticism (6i). But there was also an outer environment conspiring toward such an "orientation", those religious controversies where the argument was between "orthodox rationalism and deistic rationalism". At the start M. Leroy points to the presence in England of something different from the rationalism of the time, that among the bourgeois there existed "a veritable appetite for mysticism" (63). For these people had a "very lively feeling about morality and they confounded the essential propositions of religion with moral prescriptions. Thus is explained why the English moralists of the eighteenth century all seek the prin- ciple of morality in affectivity; thus is also explained the fact that classicism and rationalism will give place very rapidly to a renaissance of sentiment; thus is explained the extent and depth of the religious awakening of i740; all affectivity was not dead in the generality of minds" (64). Thus there was a native ground for criticism of ration- alism. But it had to have its day first with the flood-tide of interest in "natural philosophy", and it gained expression both in philosophy and in deism. The rise and development of this rationalism is finely delineated by M. Leroy. He observes well that the early deism of Herbert of Cherbury was at bottom simply an expression of moral creed. "This moralism could not yet outrage the bourgeois of that epoch, who had a tendency themselves to consider morality as the essence of religion. But soon there formed some kind of original com- bination of the critical temper, the deterministic attitude of science, and that moralism which was an enemy to all external ritual; and to this were added polemic ardor and personal quarrels. . . . Hume lived through all these polemics . . ." (73 f.). The salient figures in the coming argument were Shaftesbury, Toland, "the most perfect type of</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 423 English free-thinker in the eighteenth century" (ioo) ; Collins, charged with "the polemic instinct" (104); Clarke who really led to agnostic- ism, and Wollaston, Derham, Leslie, Sherlock, Tindal, Butler, and Berkeley. Incidentally the author makes very much more of William Derham than did Leslie Stephen in his English Thought in the Eighteenth Century: "Here [in the Physico-Theology] Derham sketches a pragmatism of sense knowledge which represents and de- velops a French author certainly known to Hume because of his re- nown, Abbe Pluche, author of the Spectacle of Nature. Our knowledge has been adapted by God to our activity; it does not permit us to attain the foundations of things, but it suffices for the needs 'of life" (I42). Now this doctrine was very far from being peculiar to Pluche and Derham; it had been expressed earlier by one of great influence in French thought, Malebranche, the magic of whose fancy most certainly touched Hume in his youth. The disregard of Malebranche here and in the later treatment of the doctrine of imagination is the sole omission which one can criticise in the historical part of the work. At the conclusion of this chapter there is a masterly statement of the critic's function: "If it is proper, however, to explain in a certain measure the philosophy of Hume by its relations to prior doctrines, one must not go to the extreme, and make of that philosophy a kind of mosaic composed of things derived from without; one would be led to refuse originality to all thinkers, who necessarily form themselves by study of the doctrines held in esteem in their own epoch; it is not even the case that certain problems impose themselves at a determinate epoch, but rather a certain manner of posing the problems; the per- sonality of a philosopher reveals itself in the way in which he systema- tizes the diverse questions, in the directive idea which gives all the value to the particular solutions; it is that vision of the whole which one must needs rediscover with Hume, that essential conception which a veritable philosopher often lives and utilizes without fully knowing it, that conception, indeed, without which a writer is nothing but a very clever man, an expert and seductive mosaicist" (i99). How Hume came to his own distinctive thought is suggested: "The orthodox and the deists both supported themselves by reason, and yet they could not bring themselves to any agreement; the camp of the deists is it- self divided into two groups.... These three groups are otherwise not clearly delimited from each other; they have relations to each other through transitional forms and they are distinguished only in their clearest forms. Those interested in science interdict reason's passing beyond science and the mechanism of the phenomenal world; the moralists proclaim that reality is essentially rational and good . . .; intermediate thinkers, carried on by their moralism or restrained by</page><page sequence="4">424 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. their good sense and their religious respect, finish by deciding for an inconsistent anthropomorphism which, the moment one presses it, vanishes in more or less complete agnosticism. These three essential tendencies are symbolized in the Dialogues on Natural Religion by Philo, Cleanthes, and Demea. These personages are not portraits of certain philosophers contemporary with Hume; they are types, more simple, more coherent, and more logical than the philosophers from whom they drew their traits" (i99 ff.) And Hume, envisaging that situation, found his work before him: "It is necessary to take the problem up again from the very beginning, to define human reason and delimit its domain. Such is the design of Hume in his Treatise on Human Nature." The second chapter is an excellent systematic study: Part i on "The Theory of Knowledge"; Part 2 on "The Critique of Religious Ra- tionalism"; Part 3 on "The Moral and Religious Conventionalism". The author restates a constructive view which is being increasingly adopted, that for Hume the imagination appeared to be the important factor in human knowledge. "Essentially the imagination is a tendency to continue a course of thought sketched under the action of experi- ence; it is a power of unification and systematization; it introduces into the internal world more regularity than we can ascertain in it.... It is also a tendency to exteriorization, to the objectivation of our senti- ments; it is the imagination that transports into the phenomena the necessity of causal relations; it is this tendency which projects, like phantoms, our own sensible qualities in the external world so that we are made to see bodies in a picturesque manner. In brief, the imagination is the principle of all mental life" (2i6 f.). "Experimental science has its value from its rigor and precision and not from the fact that it brings into play any faculties superior to the imagination. To reason correctly is to give to objects the relations they have in experience. As to the final nature of reason, of experimental reasoning, we can say nothing; it is an original quality which certainly affiliates itself with habit; but habit and reason translate the nature peculiar to the mind, and we cannot go any farther" (224). "In short, the human mind utilizes but one process when it reasons about facts, analogy; but when the analogy is great between the present and the past, when it is almost equivalent to an identity, we give to reasoning by analogy the name of causal reasoning; when the analogy is weak and practical- ly vanishing, our conclusions are uncertain and if we do not attend to the extreme weakness of their probability, we fall into prejudices. One passes thus by an insensible gradation from prejudices to scientific conclusions. The fact of the matter is that we are simply being dis- posed to this by an essential faculty of the imagination which by its nature affiliates itself with habit and tends spontaneously to report</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 425 the past in the present" (242). "Reason or understanding or imagina- tion-the name is of little import-is I know not what in us that is capable of taking on habits under the action of sensible phenomena, of education or of the passions . . . So experimental science is com- posed of human conventions which regulate themselves as much as possible on the phenomenal reality but present always a human trans- lation of it. That conclusion Hume does not explicitly present here, but as the subsequent analyses prove, all his philosophy is essentially a conventionalism" (245). But this must be shown through a part treating of his "Critique of Religious Rationalism". In the Dialogues the argument from final causes is said to be handled with superb mastery: "That perfection of form clearly manifests the attention given by Hume to the examina- tion of the religious problem; it supposes not only extensive informa- tion but constant reflection to bring to light the essential points of the argument" (272). The twelfth and last Dialogue, however, poses a problem of interpretation as to whether Hume was sincere in al- lowing an affirmative belief. Was he not, perhaps, merely using a literary device, as others had frequently done before him? The same apparent trick was employed at the end of his essay on Immortality, and again at the conclusion of the essay on Miracles, which A. E. Taylor seems to think is "wilful persiflage". But what did Hume mean by his "renunciation of criticism" at the end of these various works? Did he "really feel the inquietude of the divine" and desire an express revelation without, however, believing that it was possible? What could he possibly mean by "revelation"? M. Leroy defers the final decision as regards the Dialogues but recalls how early the essay on Miracles was written, and also, what some of the authors figuring in Hume's studious youth had impressed on him-such men as Leslie and Sherlock, and possibly the remoter figures of Montaigne, Plutarch, and Cicero-that there might be an "internal miracle". So Hume could well have been perfectly sincere and he would probably have ex- plained himself as follows. "While recognising the possibility of the miracle, I find in experience that it is impossible practically to dis- tinguish by external appearances a true miracle from a deception; ... the sole miracle of which one could be certain is the internal miracle; it is the immediate knowledge of the divine presence, although I have never yet experienced it. I know it only by hearsay, so I can neither deny nor affirm anything in that regard! Such should be the attitude of Hume, . . ." (322). And in any case this much he said himself, and it must be heeded, that there is a distinction between the sceptic and the man, and that the working of imagination will take place in his own mind as in other human beings, with the result that some belief will be there. "So to affirm that God is the Cause of the world and that</page><page sequence="6">426 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. He has established a purposive order is to use convenient expressions; it is to utilize veritable conventions" (293). This position is substantiated in a part treating of Hume's "Moral and Religious Conventionalism". The theme is that "Morality and positive religion have their origin in certain primitive sentiments; not that man is originally a moral and religious animal, but he possesses originally certain sentiments which, when called into play, lead him necessarily towards morality and religion; these, then, are human conventions but conventions well founded, which result indirect- ly from human nature" (324 f.). This doctrine is found in the Natural History of Religion, in the Treatise, and in the Inquiry concern*ing Morals. The latter revealed "the conventional character of all the social virtues which are nonetheless not arbitrary; these conventions are absolutely necessary to the maintenance of social life, to the preser- vation of all human life, and since they are evident and strike the most obtuse intelligences, they can be called natural" (329). "The moral conventions are not original, and human reflection has been required to establish them; but their institution was necessary and still more evident and, as it were, dictated by nature" (336). "It is not being unfaithful to the thought of Hume to add to these examples the laws of experimental science and the principle of causality on which they are founded. If in effect the circumstances had been otherwise, if the constitution of the human mind had been equally different, we should be disposed according to other principles because we should have taken on other mental habits; between the permanent, irresistible, and universal principles of the imagination and the variable, weak, and irregular ones, there is no such difference as that which in logic separates the necessary from the contingent" . . . (338). "It is the same then with the essential dogmas of religion as with the moral virtues; they are artificial institutions, conventions, but not arbitrary decrees; they are founded on human nature" (345). The concluding chapter is entitled "The Humanism of Hume". After a review of contemporary criticism the author states his own views of the purport of the avowed "scepticism". "Intelligence can sometimes produce suspense of judgment; it permits prolonged re- flection; it cannot produce the definitive suspension of assent. Man is made to affirm; however, he none the less retains a durable trace of his passage through scepticism; that trace is circumspection, in- tellectual modesty; it is, as Hume calls it, mitigated scepticism, . . (366). When the sceptic faces the religious problem he finds opposed hypotheses and cannot make any decision. "But he ceases to philoso- phize, and becomes a man again; at once anthropomorphic theism imposes itself upon him because it is an explanation satisfying to his intelligence and to his feelings. But the sceptic is still wary of</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 7 it, and he reduces it to a single proposition which gives him neither the tranquillity nor the security of the believer. Hence he calls with all his might for a revelation, an internal miracle, an experience of a special order which might bring certitude to him, a certitude compar- able to the experience which is the foundation of science. He does not condemn the appeal which arises spontaneously in him; it is manifestly the expression of a natural sentiment, and perhaps the manifestations of a reality inaccessible to intelligence; alongside of science there is place for another experience. Such is the attitude of Hume. He is above all devoted to experimental science and he rejects all explanation which is not made by causes and effects; but 'he knows the value of that experimental science which, as constituted by men, is only human knowledge and probably does not represent objective reality as it is.- In consequence, the anthropomorphic re- ligious explanation preserves a certain value, not in its crude form, but in a purified form . . . But one must not let oneself be deceived here, the mocking smile of the sceptic conceals a hope which scarcely dares avow itself: science does not ruin all belief. By that attitude Hume is the precursor of a state of mind very frequent in our day; it is by anticipation that he brings the deistic quarrel to a close, and that is why his role is important in the history of ideas: a new spiritual orientation is suggested which will later become more precise" (369 f.). "His philosophy is essentially a humanism in all the senses of the word. It was formed by study of the classics and yet failed not to fol- low, in their development, the sciences of nature-a living humanism which does not freeze itself in a beatific contemplation of the past. It forecasts the 'humanism' of today in refusing to follow the meta- physicians and theologians in their abstruse discussions beyond human experience, and in endeavoring to explain, by the spontaneous play of human tendencies, science, morality, and the positive religions, and in honoring the natural aspirations of the feelings which have been made uneasy over human destiny" (374). It is undoubtedly this humanistic aspect of Hume which is constantly bringing our contemporaries back to him as one whose meaning appears to be congenial. And this account is probably as true an interpretation as it is possible to give in this day and age, with the interests and tendencies what they are. We understand Hume very much better after such a view of him both in the setting of history and in re- lation to our own "conventions". But others at other times have seen, and others at future times will see, an aspect that appears to be some- what slighted in this rendering of his philosophy, and it might be well for us to hazard a critical view of this position even though we accept it-that is, we too, should play the sceptic even with our own belief.</page><page sequence="8">4,28 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIII. First, a caution that we, as critics, should not read into the mind of our subject the intention to perform those works which we ourselves, surveying from the vantage point of subsequent history, perceive to be his achievement. "The Treatise and the Essays, like the Dialogues, combat deism and orthodox rationalism by scepticism" (x48). And so it is said that "the design of Hume in his Treatise of Human Nature" was to define human reason and its domain (italics mine, 202). In effect, to be sure, this was so. Hume proves in, the light of events to have been the critic of rationalism in every quarter, and his work an examination of the nature of human reason as it deals with the matter of experience. But it may be a mistake to regard all that as his own conscious purpose, that he set out to combat ration- alism as such, that he planned his Treatise accordingly, He certainly did not express himself so. He actually spoke of his own "system", which M. Leroy indeed has so well delineated as a "conventionalism". And being truly devoted to experimental reasoning, as the author de- scribes him, Hume was more interested in the specific questions of philosophy, the meaning of cause, substance, an external world, a self, a Deity, than in any wholesale point of view which had to be despatched by his scepticism. It is characteristic of such a thinker to attend to par- ticulars and not to generalities; it is the historian who traffics in the latter rather than the philosopher. And perhaps we must go farther in our questioning of this position: was Hume even implicitly an an- tagonist of rationalism? His early examination of the maxim that a cause must exist for every beginning of existence was an instance of purely logical reasoning; his discovery was one of pure reason. Did Hume ever outgrow this early demand for a necessity of reason? Was he satisfied with his "system" of "conventionalism"? Even if one adopts this "conventionalism" as the true reading of riume one must beware of misinterpretation due to the suggestions of such a term. Convention and nature have historically been contrasting notions. The author makes it clear, to be sure, that the conventions of thought and belief in this case are perfectly "natural" and "neces- sary". But there is one convention which, strangely enough, is scarcely noticed in this book, namely, the belief in the continued and independent existence of a world of objects distinct from perception. Hume de- scribes this distinction as arising within experience itself. He may not have held firmly to that view, as when he spoke of a "pre- established harmony" between perceptions and the order of Nature. But no one who expounds the meaning of his thought afterwards is entitled to say that, according to its principles, human science "prob- ably does not represent objective reality as it is". That is suspecting the science of experience because of a fiction reared by experience, and it is forsaking the phenomenalist point of view which Hume</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS 429 himself had just barely attained. But even supposing that he himself had lapsed into a natural realism-thinking of objects external to him- self to which his perceptions ought to correspond in order to be true- even supposing he doubted such a correspondence, still he gives no evidence of having consoled himself for his scepticism with the social validity of the "conventions". Nor is there real ground to suppose that the light for which he called, the "revelation", was thought of by him as an "experience" alongside of science. It is more probable that he simply wanted a good and sufficient "reason". He sought, it seems, the validity of a perceived rationale, an insight. One cannot escape the notion, therefore, that Hume was a sceptic to the 'end of his days, and precisely because he was a rationalist. And perhaps it is still best to call his philosophy by the name he chose himself, a "mitigated scepticism". C. W. HENDEL MCGILL UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
