<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Studies Quarterly (1984) 28, 245-305 A Pre-Theory Revisited: World Politics in an Era of Cascading Interdependence JAMES N. ROSENAU University of Southern California On the presumption that the structures of global affairs are undergoing a profound crisis of authority and other changes of a comparable magnitude, the analysis seeks to build a comprehensive theory of world politics that synthesizes these develop- ments at micro as well as macro levels. The synthesis is accomplished by focusing on the simultaneity and expansivity of patterns promoting both the coherence and the breakdown of systems at all levels, patterns that are given the label of 'cascading interdependence' and that are explored through the concepts of action scripts, analytic aptitudes, subgroupism, aggregation, and adaptation. In this context governments are posited as increasingly ineffective as international actors and individuals as increasingly skilled in their public roles. In addition, analysts of world politics are seen as inevitably shaping the course of events, so that it is important for them to remain ever sensitive to the ways in which they interact with the world they seek to study. Quarter-century anniversaries invite retrospection. They cry out for assessments of goals realized, problems encountered, errors committed, and solutions envisioned. Sometimes the result is despair, but in our case retrospection would surely be an upbeat undertaking, one rife with opportunities to trace growth, record progress, identify needs, and clarify objectives. One need only glance at any international relations journal or text of the 1950s to appreciate how stunning and diverse have been the advances in theoretical sophistication and methodological creativity in the first 25 years since the International Studies Association was founded. Or so it seems to one whose professional career spans the life of ISA. I marvel at the extent to which incisive analysis and imaginative formulations have supplanted the ambiguous and limited conceptions that once were so commonplace. I delight in the realization that common sense is now subjected to counter-intuitive reasoning, that single-cause explanations have yielded to multivariate impulses, that static frameworks Author's note: Parts of this article were presented as the Presidential Address at the Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association, Atlanta, March 29, 1984. An earlier draft was assessed at a Workshop on International Relations Theory, sponsored by the School of International Relations of the University of .Southern California and convened in Ojai, California on December 2-4, 1983. For their helpful dialogue on that draft, I am grateful to Richard Ashley, Raymond Duvall,JeffFrieden, Michael Fry, David Lake, Dwain Mefford, andJohn Odell. That they will hardly recognize this revised version is testimony to the value of their feedback. The suggestions of Margaret L. Campbell, Heidi H. Hobbs, Margaret Karns, and Steven Krasner have also been valuable.

Problems persist, to be sure. As indicated below, our progress has not freed us of perplexity over the changing structures of global politics or of the need to monitor our conduct as analysts and advocates. Important as the problems may be, however, I have no trouble at this moment of celebration in asserting that they will surely begin to yield to our talents if the pace of our progress in the next quarter-century matches that of the last one. Yet, to examine the growth and difficulties we have experienced is to take on an impossible task. Our collective efforts have been marked by such an extraordinary maturation in the way international phenomena are probed and analyzed that it might well require a multi-authored, multi-volume encyclopedia to document and fully evaluate the expansion of our field. Thus a more modest undertaking is in order here, one that is more limited in scope and yet consistent with the spirit of critical assessment evoked by our having achieved our 25th birthday. Such a context need not be contrived. This month marks another anniversary that seems well suited to the tasks of retrospection: it was just 20 years ago that I first presented my paper on 'Pre-Theories and Theories of Foreign Policy' at a Northwestern University conference,' and the sentimentalist in me sees its survival across two decades as worthy of commemoration. Or at least I like to think that despite the extensive and cogent criticisms to which the ideas in the original paper have since been subjected,2 they still seem to enjoy sufficient currency to warrant revisitation. Equally important, while my hard-nosed, analytic self acknowledges that the paper's anniversary is a personal one and that the fact of its survival is thus hardly an occasion for ISA to celebrate, some of the concerns of that pre-theoretical effort do offer a basis for organizing a modest assessment of where we have been, where we have strayed, and where we ought to be going. Anticipating what follows, let me assert my organizing themes at the outset. There are 10 of them: 1. The Pre-Theory was a static product of a static era (the early 1960s) and needs to be rendered dynamic if it is to be applicable to the dynamic circumstances of the 1980s. 2. Its present insufficiencies derive from the onset of global changes that may amount to a world crisis of authority or may otherwise be far more profound than any of us have yet to recognize. 3. To increase the likelihood of glimpsing any new global dynamics that may be at work, it is important to presume that any and every system comprising global life is always on the verge of collapse. 4. Among the many sources of change, the explosion of subgroupism, of individuals redefining their loyalties in favor of more close-at-hand collectivities, is especially relevant to the global crisis of authority. 5. The explosion of subgroupism is, in turn, rooted in a substantial enlargement of the analytic aptitudes of citizens throughout the world which, along with a diminished sense of control over the course of their lives, has led individuals to heighten the salience of subgroup affiliations and lessen the relevance of whole system ties, thereby precipitating the authority crisis that has altered the distribution of power and the effectiveness of states on a global scale.</page><page sequence="3">JAMES N. ROSENAU 247 6. The confluence of new structures and old patterns has resulted in self-generating and far-reaching dimensions of global life that are so recurrent as to amount to an overall pattern of disorder, one that can usefully be called Cascading Interdepen- dence. 7. Three major concepts-role scenarios, aggregation, and adaptation are compel- ling as means through which to render the Pre-Theory dynamic and thereby capable of probing the emergent structures and persistent patterns of our waning century. 8. As war drives long-cycle theory, as the distribution of power and the position of hegemons drive Neo-Realist theory, as class struggle and control over productive capabilities drive Marxist theory, so does the interaction of the authority crisis, the mushrooming of subgroupism, and the enlargement of the analytic aptitudes of individuals on a global scale drive the theory of cascading interdependence. 9. The theory of cascading interdependence can be developed without dwelling on war, power balances, or military strategies because in focusing on authority relationships, aggregative dynamics, and adaptive mechanisms it is probing phenomena along the same continuum of which the threat or exercise of force is but one extreme. 10. As observers of global life, we are, inevitably, also actors in the processes of cascading interdependence and must thus be ever alert to maintaining ourselves as open systems. These themes are quite different from those on which the Pre-Theory was founded. At that time, caught up in the heady euphoria of science's seemingly unlimited capacity to explore heretofore inexplicable dimensions of the field, I was mainly concerned with explaining those patterns that seemed elusive and were thus presumed to underlie baffling shifts and fluctuations in foreign policy. In addition, I had hoped to contribute to an ever-widening intersubjective consensus about the field and the appropriate methods for studying it. Now, with the advantage of hindsight, it seems clear that any attempt to probe new and changing dimensions of global life must proceed on the basis of also comprehending those features that appear stable and predictable. Now it seems obvious to me that to aspire to theoretical breakthroughs we need to return to fundamentals, to take nothing for granted, to delineate rather than assume the authority relations that link micro actions and macro outcomes, to presume rather than dismiss the possibility that even the most permanent of global structures are always susceptible to transformation, to regard both the long-standing and recent actors in world politics as no less capable of faltering and disappearing than they are of succeeding and surviving. And now it is also clear that a broadly shared paradigm is presently beyond our grasp and that the dialectic dialogues that have emerged instead of consensus may actually stimulate progress toward greater comprehension. Changing Observers of a Changing World But, following the Pre-Theory's stress on the need for self-conscious inquiry, it is crucial to acknowledge at the outset that a return to fundamentals may prove exceedingly difficult. To treat basic structures and processes as no longer given is to risk obfuscation and uncertainty. It may also force us to confront signs of slippage in our conduct as scholars, to admit that the dynamics of global change may be upending our balance and capacities as observers, thereby lessening our confidence that we can comprehend global</page><page sequence="4">248 A Pre- Theory Revisited patterns and explain their underlying dynamics. Even worse, we might discover that the diminution of our confidence has induced us into curbing our creative impulses, narrowing our horizons, and settling for immediate, manageable problems as research foci rather than aspiring to knowledge-building on a grand scale. Still worse, to treat long-standing constants as dynamics is to face the realization of how fully we have been living in conceptual jails of our own making and the extent to which we have thus been prisoners of our own theories. If confusion has led to disillusion and loss of confidence, it is certainly understandable. The breakdown and diffusion of authority structures, the impotence of governments, the advent of economic disarray in the First World and the persistence of poverty in the Third World, the simultaneity of collapse and coherence in global, regional, and national systems, the intractability of the arms race, and the overall decline of civility are but a few of the patterns that run counter to our understanding of the forces that were at work in the world at that distant time when ISA was founded. Back then, the orderliness of the patterns seemed quite recognizable and, accordingly, world affairs seemed subject to influence and redirection. Now everything seems in disarray, as if neither men of good will nor tyrannical regimes can affect the macro forces of transnational change that are unfolding everywhere. The world, in short, has let many of us down. It simply has not conformed to our expectations. Our theoretical premises have been vividly negated by events and we have been endlessly surprised by developments for which our formulations allowed no room. An Egyptian President was not supposed to address the Israeli Knesset and an American President was not supposed to toast his hosts in China. The Embassy in Teheran was not supposed to be overtaken and Solidarity was not supposed to gain momentum. The price of oil was supposed to remain stable and so were the world's currencies. Deterrence policies were supposed to reduce the threat of nuclear holocaust and detente policies were supposed to ameliorate East-West frictions. Not all of us, of course, feel overwhelmed or dispirited by such developments. For the Realists, Neo-Realists, and others among us who are accustomed to presuming an anarchical system and anticipating a deepening and spreading of the chaos it promotes, the changing landscape of world politics appears as simply more of the same, as an updated version of what is bound to happen when a hegemon declines and global power thereby gets redistributed. For them the surprises may lie more in the fact that other embassies have not been seized and that the sharp jumps in oil prices did not produce more intense disturbances. For those long-time American students of international affairs who attached more importance to the world's growing interdependence than to the shifts in its distribution of power, the disillusionment has been especially acute. For us, the transformation of global structures and the dynamic pace of change was accompanied by marked declines in both our country's capacities as a superpower and our own resources as researchers. Many of us who entered the profession before, say, ISA's tenth birthday had become accustomed to assuming that this was the American Century, a time when the United States could exercise enough control and wisdom to move the course of events toward a more sane and decent world. Perhaps equally important, the abbreviated American Century was also a period when there were more than enough funds for us to gather data, travel, confer, and otherwise engage in activities that reinforced the vision of an ever-expanding universe of reliable and cumulative knowledge. All that came to an end with Vietnam. Not only did the events of the early 1970s reveal that the country's wisdom and effectiveness as a superpower could no longer be</page><page sequence="5">JAMES N. ROSENAU 249 assumed, but they also contributed to, or at least coincided with, the beginning of the steady erosion of suppport for international studies. In retrospect the era of plenty in academe that preceded the 1970s seems like a never-to-be-repeated anomaly; but, for those who enjoyed its fruits, the subsequent paucity of research support may well be a substantial component of the frustrated tendency to feel the world is neither orderly nor knowable. This 'anguish of the liberal' gets expressed in a variety of ways by drifting unabashedly into the realm of values and abandoning any semblance of analytic detachment, by confining inquiry to immediate policy questions, by focusing on obscure and low-level theoretical problems, by denouncing one's own past formulations, and/or by frantically searching for new concepts that might 'Letter reveal the dynamics of cascading change. It is not my purpose to downgrade such reactions or to appeal for calm in a turbulent era. While I may know what reaction works for me, I surely do not know how others might best cope with the dynamics of the world we are committed to studying. Our ties to that world are too intimate for any among us to dare to tell others how they should conduct their inquiries. What I might view as an anguished reaction others may well regard as highly rational. What might be disillusioning for those in my generation who treated the discipline's growth as personal challenges and whose midlife crises were thus intensified by the advent of global chaos and the decline in research support may, for those in subsequent generations, loom merely as problems of the discipline that should and can be addressed. Accordingly, my purpose is, simply, to call attention to the fact that we are open systems, that we are thus vulnerable to a variety of reactions, and that we are bound to be better scholars the more conscious we are of how a changing world is changing us. The extent to which many of us thrash around for new concepts with which to comprehend and explain the rapid transformations of global life offers a good illustration of how confusion and a loss of confidence may be undermining our capacities as observers. I am, let me hasten to note, especially culpable in this respect, having moved through such concepts as calculated control (Rosenau, 1963), linkage politics (1969), political adaptation (1970, 1981), aggregative processes (1980), and fragmeg- ration (1983a) without pausing to explore fully their explanatory power. Indeed, the concept of cascading interdependence developed below might be viewed as merely another frantic attempt to cope with the confusion of emerging and unfamiliar structures. Yet I am not alone in this tendency. As one observer (Schmitter, 1983) has noted in the context of confounding changes in the structures of West European politics, in recent years social scientists have developed at least thirteen concepts international division of labor, center-periphery relations, internal colonialism, economic interdependence, organized complexity, diffusion processes, fiscal federalism, politikverftechtung, territorial devolution, transnational phenomena, international regimes, micro nationalism, and neolocalism in an attempt to cope with the shifting structures of political units and their relationships. Nor have our reactions to global change been confined to a quest for new conceptual equipment. The search has also led to broad frameworks and models, even to whole fields of inquiry and schools of thought. As Schmitter (1983: 3) puts it: New protodisciplines or interdisciplinary fields such as regional science, peace research, international integration theory, theories of the local state, and world-systems analysis have emerged to deal with analyzing situations in which the units of interest, identity, and authority have become increasingly incongruent, and with describing the efforts which have been made-or should be made-to</page><page sequence="6">250 A Pre- Theory Revisited readjust spatial boundaries, redistribute functional competences, restructure productive systems, and redefine collective images in order to cope with this new reality. This is not to imply that efforts to develop and refine concepts appropriate to newly emergent structures are necessarily expressive of confusion and are bound to be counterproductive. Political theory is, to a large extent, a product of upheaval and breakdown, of the need to rationalize and/or explain new conditions and problems (Wolin, 1969: 1080), so that the present impulses to theorize are in continuous need of nurturing. If new, even frantic, conceptual formulations are required to sustain such impulses, then surely they should be undertaken. It may well be, in fact, that the process of thrashing around for new conceptual equipment will lead to theoretical break- throughs. Clearly, for example, the concept of international regimes, focusing as it does on issue-areas wherein transnational ties and informal decision-rules have evolved to compensate for the insufficiency of established lines of authority, offers some promise in this regard. Even the concepts of role scenarios and cascading interdependence outlined below, I like to think, have potential as building blocks of viable theory and may thus be more than a fretful reaction to global chaos. But there remains the danger that frustration over the course of events will lead to the replacement of incisive concepts with formulations that are vague and elusive, that do not discipline our inquiries and allow us to stray from tough-minded empiricism, and that thereby undermine our capacity as observers. Consider, for example, how Burton's (1983: 16) deep and urgent despair over the state of world affairs leads him to obfuscate conceptual distinctions by equating idealism with realism and viewing an 'appeal' to one as an appeal to the other. Or ponder the fact that the diverse meanings attached to the concept of a world system have proliferated to the point where the concept now has to be differentiated in terms of whether it is used 'with or without the hyphen' (Thompson, 1983). More significantly, consider the unrestrained enthusiasm (e.g., Krasner, 1984; Lentner, 1984) that has greeted and sustained the tendency to resurrect the 'State' as an analytic concept and to employ it ambiguously in at least five different ways (Benjamin and Duvall, 1982). While this tendency doubtless stems from many sources including the increased relevance of economic variables and the need to posit an adversary for dependent peoples, classes, and multinational corporations one of them certainly seems to be the failure of the available conceptual equipment to quicken the slow and erratic pace of knowledge-building. But even if frustration can be contained and confusion transformed into creative insight, how to proceed? Given a greater self-consciousness of our analytic selves as vulnerable to the course of world affairs, how to avoid slipping into narrow policy concerns or reliance on elusive conceptual equipment? Under conditions of dynamic change how does one retain and serve the aspiration to knowledge-building on a grand scale? The answers are not simple. The very reasons to be self-conscious also underlie our vulnerability and leave us ever tempted to forgo long-term goals for short-term satisfactions. Yet, though it may seem self-evident, the key lies in understanding that as observers we are, inevitably, also actors, that we are as subject to the ebbs and flows of world politics as the individuals and collectivities on whom we focus our analytic skills. More specifically, we need to appreciate that the dynamics of global life are affecting us, that we are always in danger of getting caught up so fully in the transformations at work that we will lurch erratically across the global landscape we seek to comprehend.</page><page sequence="7">JAMES N. ROSENAU 251 Such, at least, is my aspiration for the ensuing analysis. I hope it suggests how a return to fundamentals can fortify us against self-defeating inquiries and thereby reinforce our commitment to building knowledge that is enduring, that can outlast the policy concerns of today and serve equally well the needs of tomorrow. Patterned Disorder In rereading the Pre-Theory I am struck by how time-bound it is. Despite the emphasis it places on the world's growing complexity and interdependence, the original paper remains clearly a product of the early 1960s,3 of that relatively tranquil period when both the United States and its social scientists assumed that plentitude and growth were the underlying condition of global life and thus were confident that any problem could be resolved if enough resources and imagination were brought to bear on it. Nothing in the Pre-Theory anticipated a world of mounting scarcities, faltering superpowers, collapsing economies, and pervasive breakdowns of authority. It did refer to the need to let our variables vary widely, but it certainly did not contemplate empirical variations that would encompass fundamentalist upheavals in the East and burning cities in the West. And while it also urged probing beyond manifest structures for latent tendencies, it certainly did not trace conceptual horizons that allowed for oil crunches, organized terrorism, currency crises, and information revolutions. Theoretically, too, the Pre-Theory was time-bound. It was overly simple in its reliance on the natural sciences and the aspiration to a cumulative theory that can be applied to any actor at any time. In so doing, the Pre-Theory utterly failed to anticipate the subsequent advent of a generation of scholars who, perhaps disillusioned by Vietnam, Watergate, and other corruptions of the post-war order, came to doubt the utility of cumulation and welcomed counterintuitive challenges to established pro- cedures. More specifically, encouraged by the works of Lakatos and Musgrave (1970), Habermas (1971, 1974, 1976), and other critical theorists (Held, 1980) who were skeptical about the prevailing scientific paradigm, many in the post-Vietnam, post- Popper generation became committed to the idea that knowledge-building is better served through a dialectic method that sustains conflicting theories than through a scientific method that seeks consensual theory founded on empirical proof. Some among us are saying, in effect, that the disorder which marks world affairs also characterizes our efforts to comprehend world affairs. Equally important, and as will be seen, they are saying that neither the empirical nor the theoretical chaos are regrettable, that the quality of life as well as the quality of knowledge may be advanced through conditions of disorder. At the core of the Pre-Theory's failure was a static conception of authority structures, both within and between societies. As noted below in Figure 1, it treated the world as frozen into a structure comprised of nation-states which had governments that interacted through an activity called foreign policy. To be sure, allowance was made for variations in the way domestic factors influenced the external behavior of governments as well as for a modicum of relevant transnational interactions among nongovernmental actors and between them and governments. But the flow of activities and influence outside government-to-government relations was posited as ancillary because of an implicit assumption that all the actors in the system understood their roles to be located in the unvarying structures of the state system. Such a perspective was not in itself erroneous. States and governments were (and are) central international actors and they did (and do) initiate much of the flow of influence along the tributaries of the</page><page sequence="8">252 A Pre- Theory Revisited international system. Rather, the trouble with the Pre-Theory was less its descriptive accuracy and more its conceptual rigidity. It did not subsume dynamics whereby authority relationships within and among states could change. Stated in terms of a concept developed below, the Pre-Theory presumed that the role scenarios of all the system's actors played out sequences in which their authority and their responsiveness to the authority of the others was fixed and unquestionable. The habits of the state system were treated as deeply engrained in the leaders and the led, in the powerful and the weak, in domestic publics and state bureaucracies, and in all the other collectivities that comprised the world in the first decades after World War II. Indeed, it seems clear in retrospect that all the actors were presumed to be so habituated to their roles as to lack a capacity for learning or otherwise altering the authority patterns into which they fit. Compliance and system maintenance were implicitly posited as the givens of authority structures and only the way in which authority was exercised was seen to vary. Thus it is hardly surprising that the Pre-Theory was marked by a narrow preoccupation with foreign policy as the phenomenon to be explained. Not only did the original formulation focus on the sources of foreign policy behavior without elaborating on the nature of that behavior, but in so doing it also diverted attention from the patterns of world politics to which the external policies of states contribute. That is, the only outcomes it sought to explain were the policies undertaken by governments abroad and it explicitly eschewed casting a net large enough to encompass the outcomes that result from the interaction of governments and other international actors. As specified, therefore, the Pre-Theory was bound to be insensitive to much of the change that has unfolded in recent years. Similarly, since recurrent foreign policy undertakings are relatively easy to identify and quantify, they lend themselves readily to a natural science format. The Pre-Theory suffered from an imprecise formulation of what constitutes foreign policy, but it nonetheless encountered no difficulty in classifying the external behavior of states as the dependent variable and treating the individual, role, governmental, societal, and systemic antecedents of such behavior as independent variables. Such variables are equally operative in world politics and, in retrospect, it is regrettable that this more encompasing focus was not at the center of the original formulation. What was a Pre-Theory of Foreign Policy could and should have been cast as a Pre-Theory of Global Politics. As will be seen, the ensuing analysis does not shy away from casting this wider net. The question arises as to whether the advent of grand formulations since the original Pre-Theory have not obviated the need to cast a wider net. Why not work with, or rework, neo-realism, regimes, long-cycle theory, or the world-system approach, some might ask, rather than revisit the Pre-Theory and attempt to expand its scope? I have pondered this question at some length, aware that the natural tendency to see vitality rather than obsolescence in one's prior work reinforces the inclination to stick with it. Nevertheless, revisitation seems preferable to replacement for several reasons. One is that while I envy the parsimony accomplished by the assumption of neo-realism that states-as-actors alone infuse logic and substance into global structures, by the simplifying premises of the world-system approach on the role of the capitalist world economy, and by the postulates of long-cycle theory as to the transforming dynamics of global wars, the empiricist in me is restless with such elegant formulations. More accurately, I am impressed by the multiplicity and diversity of the motives, actors, outcomes, systems, and levels of aggregation in world affairs that do not fit snugly into the grand formulations. There seem to be so many points at which authority structures and other</page><page sequence="9">JAMES N. ROSENAU 253 interaction patterns may be changing that I see a danger of premature closure on behalf of parsimony. The fact that new generations of computers provide a realistic basis for some relaxation of our aspirations to parsimony adds further to the incentive to stick with the multiple-layer perspective underlying the Pre-Theory. Even more importantly, the scope of the grand formulations is too broad to encompass the dynamics of compliance and learning on the part of subgroups within states or the world system taken as a whole. The possibility and implications of a worldwide crisis of authority can thus not be brought clearly into focus by any of these formulations. This is not the place to probe all the changes that reveal the static nature of the Pre-Theory. A revisit need only delineate those changes that may have fostered a worldwide crisis of authority and that thus highlight where and how conceptual revisions must be made to infuse dynamism into the Pre-Theory. Most of the changes have emerged at the macro level, but the changing analytic skills of publics is one alteration that has surfaced at the micro level which seems closely linked to the authority crises at all levels. Indeed, it seems so fundamental as to justify focusing on the authority structures and aggregative processes whereby the micro components of international politics get transformed into macro outcomes (see below). As elaborated at greater length elsewhere (Rosenau, 1980), six macro changes strike me as especially noteworthy. Perhaps the most conspicuous is the advent of resource scarcities and the prospect of a continual decline in their availability. Not only does the global pie seem to have acquired finite boundaries, but it has also shrunk relative to the demands made upon it. Shortages in energy, food, water, lumber, and other resources now routinely and quickly make their way through price increases, famines, droughts, etc. along the causal chains that link the structures of world politics. Just as dynamic technologies have rendered individuals and communities ever more interdependent, so have they intensified economic development and spurred more complex industrializa- tion, processes that in turn have consumed natural resources at a greater rate with the result that technological breakthroughs are then generated in order to offset the emergent resource shortages. Experts differ on the extent to which various resources are being depleted, but most agree that depletion is occurring and that the future will be marked by increasing scarcities (Barney, 1980). Another emergent pattern, stimulated in part by mounting resource scarcities as well as a variety of other factors, is the growth in the demands of the disadvantaged for a redistribution of wealth. Both within and among nations those with only small slivers of the global pie have become increasingly restless and their restlessness has brought them together in organizations, from the guerrilla movement to the Group of 77, that are increasingly coherent. And as the motives of the disadvantaged have changed and become more self-conscious, so have long-established relationships among individuals, groups, communities, and states undergone both subtle and radical shifts. Oft-times it is no longer clear who is leading and who is following, who is dominant and who is subordinate, who is astride the wave of the future and who is riding the crest of the past. Nor are the disadvantaged alone in sharing a greater consciousness of their collective needs and wants. For reasons elaborated below, the trend toward segments of society becoming increasingly aware of the ties that differentiate them what I call 'subgroupism' is unfolding on a worldwide scale. It encompasses skilled professionals as well as blue-collar workers, university faculties as well as student groups, wealthy industrialists as well as unemployed laborers, mainstream citizens as well as ethnic minorities. It would seem, in short, that wherever common ties can be identified, they have been, thus leading to the drawing together of the ties, the articulation of demands</page><page sequence="10">254 A Pre- Theory Revisited supporting them, the restructuring of loyalties and authority relationships, and the weakening of the whole system in which the subgroups share memberships. Recent events in Lebanon offer a quintessential example of subgroupism. In February, 1984, during the height of the conflict in Beirut, military units of at least ten factions were joined in battle the Amal Shiites, the Islamic Amal, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, the Druse, the Sunni Muslims, the Phalangists, three smaller Christian militias, and the Lebanese Army along with elements of the Palestine guerrillas and the Syrian, Israeli, French, British, and US armed forces. With the proliferation of subgroups and the changes in their aspirations, and with the continued advances of technology and the unending consumption of resources on which its advances rest, equally profound patterns have surfaced in the means and capabilities through which various international actors pursue their goals, reinforce their motives, and maintain their relationships. More organized and more cohesive, many subgroups in many societies are better able than ever before to back up their demands with the stubborn confidence that goals are attainable. And as the capabilities and dedication of subgroups grow, corresponding declines often follow in the authority of governments, reducing their capacity to govern and further altering the pace of change and the relative strength of the actors contesting its direction. Thus, while governments have not lost their capacity for repression, many seem increasingly less able to maintain order, solve problems, plan ahead or otherwise cope with transformations at home and challenges from abroad. In a like manner the breakdown of authority within nation-states is paralleled by the fragmentation of ties among them, so that grand alliances are no longer grand and their leaders can no longer be sure their allies will follow their leads. The bipolar world has thus given way to the multipolar world and thus may the multipolar world yield to forms of world order that have yet to mark human history. Still another emergent pattern needs to be noted. It involves the large extent to which unfamiliar socio-economic issues have crowded onto the global agenda, rivaling (and, in some instances, superseding) military-security issues for the attention of officials and publics. Generated by the world's growing interdependence, the new issues give rise to value dilemmas that are new and political processes that are not readily managed through conventional national and international channels (Rosenau, 1984). Accord- ingly, they can be viewed as genuinely transnational issues in the sense that they can be just as easily initiated and sustained by nongovernmental actors as by governments. Currency crises, acid rain, terrorism, and refugee boatloads are merely illustrative of the relatively recent advent of serious and enduring transnational issues. But all of the foregoing are macro patterns and, as such, raise the controversial question of what changes at the micro level may be occurring so that those at macro levels get initiated and sustained. This question is controversial because Neo-Realists, among others, argue that macro structures follow a logic of their own, that once they become established they can be explained in their own terms, and that to proceed in any other way is to fall victim to an unnecessary reductionism. I am not persuaded. The changes at work in the world strike me as too extensive to be independent of transformations occurring at micro levels. Why, for example, are subgroups increasingly coherent and demanding? While the answer lies partly in developments at macro levels of aggregation, especially in the national society and the international system, no small part of it is also to be found in the greater self-consciousness and expanding capabilities of individuals. As will be discussed below, a case can be made for the conclusion that, across cultures and on a worldwide basis, individuals are increasingly skilled at managing</page><page sequence="11">JAMES N. ROSENAU 255 complexity even as they also increasingly sense the course of events to be beyond control. If this is so, if much of the disarray that appears to mark global life can be traced to these emergent capacities of great masses of people, then changes at the micro level cannot be dismissed as irrelevant reductionism. At the very least it is compelling to view macro and micro phenomena as interactive, with each giving definition and structure to the other. That is, the habits of compliance and cooperation that sustain macro collectivities and institutions are the habits of individuals, but these habits are in turn shaped by the values and needs that enable the collectivities and institutions to persist. A final change pattern is operative at both the macro and micro levels. It concerns those intellectual and technological advances encompassed by the postwar upheaval in communications and the recent upsurge in its momentum that is perhaps best labeled as 'the microelectronic revolution'. Involved in the latter are the evolving developments that have produced artificial intelligence, robotics, new generations of computers, and a host of other mechanisms for facilitating the generation, flow, and application of information that apparently portend changes of such profound magnitude as to be comparable to those precipitated by the industrial revolution. Perhaps because it is so new, the microelectronic impact on global politics has yet to become fully manifest. With few exceptions (Gilpin, 1979; Kochen, 1981; King, 1983), in fact, it has not yet been recognized as capable of becoming a powerful force for change in world affairs. Nevertheless, enough has been documented on the scope and potential of microelec- tronic technology to presume that it will intensify or otherwise considerably affect all the macro and micro changes enumerated above.4 If nothing else, the interaction among resource scarcities, subgroupism, the effectiveness of governments, transnational issues, and the aptitudes of publics will be greatly deepened and extended as the impact of the technology spreads. With individuals more self-conscious and competent, with subgroups coalescing and governments foundering, with multinational corporations collaborating in joint productive enterprises and multilateral alliances splitting over monetary and economic policies, with international regimes seeking to develop the global commons and national actors trying to extend and enclose their piece of the commons, and with the microelectronic revolution hastening and enlarging all these trends, the overall structure of the international system certainly seems disorderly to an extreme. Compared to the past, the boundaries that differentiate the actors in world politics seem less clear-cut and their authority structures seem less comprehensive. Gone is the relative tidiness provided by historic jurisdictions and stable polities, by legal precedents and accepted procedures, by shared values and cultural continuities. Where the legitimacy of states was once taken for granted, today it is frayed or (as in Poland and Lebanon) virtually nonexistent. Where rebel organizations used to join together against a common enemy, today they resist each other (as among the Afghans) and even war on each other (as in the PLO). Where geographic borders once delineated a people, today they surround partial and mixed populations as the flow of refugees, immigrants, and illegal aliens swells in all parts of the world. Where economies were once largely self-contained, today they are permeated by goods and services from abroad and by underground markets and exchanges at home. Where the UN Security Council once voted on resolutions, today it mostly holds debates. Where embassies were once immune and inviolate, today they are subject to occupations and targets of explosives. Where the flights of commercial airliners once constituted a simple transnational pattern, today they can be the foci of superpower competition.</page><page sequence="12">256 A Pre- Theory Revisited It might be contended that I have overstated the degree to which change has come to mark the global scene, that a nostalgic preference for order has led to a highly selective focus on a few deviant cases, that in any event the citation of recent examples is no substitute for a broad historical perspective which posits recent changes as merely new instances of long-standing patterns, and that, indeed, the changes are less a consequence of dynamics at work in the global system and more a function of our recent progress in developing conceptual and analytic techniques for probing more deeply into the underlying structures and processes of world affairs. These lines of reasoning certainly cannot be discounted. Despite the availability of research findings that depict change in the direction of greater interdependence on a worldwide scale (e.g., Rosecrance and Stein, 1973), it may well be that a more historical approach which casts analysis in the context of centuries rather than decades would lead to the conclusion that global structures remain much the same as they have always been (Gilpin, 1981). For me, however, the charge of ahistoricism is not persuasive. As argued elsewhere (Rosenau, 1983b), too many of the fundamental parameters of modern life are of too recent origin to warrant reliance on the long-term lessons of history. The nuclear weapon, perhaps the most fundamental parameter of all, entered history only in 1945. The industrial society has yielded to the information society even more recently. And as several astute observers (e.g., Toffler, 1980; Yankelovich, 1981; Naisbett, 1982) have cogently demonstrated, the parametric change represented by the microelectronic revolution has in turn been associated with still other cultural, psychological, and socioeconomic patterns that could hardly have been imagined by earlier generations. In any event, even if such assessments exaggerate the pace and depth of change, there seems to be enough commotion in the world tojustify presuming that pervasive changes as well as resilient constancies are at work on a global scale. And even if the resulting chaos is no greater than in previous historical eras, its prevalence today is surely pervasive enough to render dubious any assumptions which posit global structures as stable and permanent. Thus it is also difficult to view the asymmetries and disorder that have come to mark world affairs as expressive of an era of transition, as reflecting processes of reorganization and regrouping that will eventually culminate in new symmetries and a new global order. Given the changes that are underway, such a perspective may well be more a function of our need for cognitive balance and orderly structures than of the dynamics at work in the world. The asymmetries may be part of the emergent order and they may even be forerunners if not stimuli of still more ungainly asymmetries in the future. Indeed, it is not difficult to discern in the interaction of the foregoing changes an underlying order, a patterned chaos, that may well persist across a number of decades. Cascading Interdependence What is that patterned chaos? What are its patterns? And what about it is chaotic? The patterns are formed by breakdowns of long-standing authority relations at every system level, from the individual through the global, which have resulted in the interlocking of two historic processes and one that derives from the recent advent of complex interdependence. The chaos results from the simultaneity, contrariety, and expansivity inherent in the interaction of these primary processes. Although given new shape and impetus by the changing structures enumerated above, the two historic processes are familiar features of social systems. They consist of those dynamics that conduce to systemic integration on the one hand and systemic disintegration on the other, to centripetal forces that today are making groups and</page><page sequence="13">JAMES N. ROSENAU 257 nations more and more interdependent even as centrifugal forces are increasingly fragmenting them into subgroups and subnations. It has always been the case that movements toward the coherence of a sociopolitical system normally foster countermove- ments toward fragmentation on the part of its subsystems and/or the systems of which it is a subsystem. Contrariwise greater coherence within subsystems has always tended to create problems of breakdown for the system of which they are a part.5 Historically these interactive tensions between systems and subsystems have been sequential, stretching out across long periods of time to accommodate the communications and learning necessary to the evolution of tensions. In this era of self-evident scarcities, self-conscious subgroupism, ineffective governments, transnational issues, and instant communica- tions, however, the time lapse between coherence and breakdown in social systems and their subsystems has been reduced virtually to zero. Simultaneity marks their interaction. Coherence and breakdown now feed on each other continuously, without respites that allow for either the system or its subsystems to consolidate and adjust to the tensions. A recent circumstance in Lebanon offers an incisive insight into the extent to which the links between systemic coherence and breakdown can be simultaneous and self-sustaining. In March, 1984, faced with an on-going civil war and the prospects of a total breakdown of their society, leaders of the nine Lebanese factions agreed to converge in Switzerland to arrange for a cease-fire and talks on 'national reconciliation'. None of the leaders could fly out of their country's national airport, however. Why? Because they could not agree on terms that would open the airport long enough to allow for their safe departure. But the interlocking and simultaneity of integrative and disintegrative tendencies within sociopolitical systems are not the only dimension along which patterned asymmetries have surfaced in global life. No less important is the expansivity of these tendencies that derives from the increasing complexity of global interdependence. In the past, with the sovereignty of states less permeable and their dependence on other states less pervasive, the tensions between a system and its subsystems were confined largely to that system. But the advent of complex interdependence has expanded the boundaries within which systemic-subsystemic tensions unfold. Today, precisely because scarcities are greater, subgroups stronger, and governments weaker, these tensions can spread and interlock with comparable tensions in other systems, thereby producing changes which cascade endlessly upon each other across the global system. The cascading changes may seem chaotic and lacking in order, but they strike me as orderly, as so inextricably intertwined through the simultaneity, contrariety, and expansivity of the integrative and disintegrative tendencies at work in the world as to form a patterned chaos. What renders these processes orderly, what makes them patterned despite the appearance of chaos, is that they derive from at least two common sources. One is the advent of a breakdown of authority on a global scale. For a host of reasons, including the changes enumerated in the previous section, relations between those who have legitimacy and/or exercise authority and those who respond to and/or comply with it have undergone transformation at every systemic level. As illustrated by the seizure of the US embassy in Iran, or by the toppling of the junta in Argentina, or by the pending United States withdrawal from UNESCO, or by the politics of Chicago to mention just a few obvious instances among the myriad that could be cited at every systemic level the role scenarios through which individuals and collectivities have long been habituated to legitimacy and authority have become increasingly less compelling and viable. The symbols, values, and memories that have been stimuli to compliance are no</page><page sequence="14">258 A Pre- Theory Revisited longer taken for granted in many parts of the world. New foci of loyalty, borne sometimes out of desperation and sometimes out of sophistication, have emerged to compete for the commitments of individuals and the orientations of collectivities. In short, the global crisis of authority can be viewed as more profound than the advent of revolutionary upheaval. It is not just the have-nots wanting to depose the haves. It is rather that the habits of compliance are being questioned, replaced, and/or abandoned on a worldwide scale, among the haves as well as the have-nots. As one observer puts it: Authorities are now being challenged in all areas of human life. Institutions are no longer respected just because they are institutions. The church, the school, the family, the state-those traditional bastions of authority-have lost a large amount of the respect that was formerly automatically accorded to them. In almost every country of the world, the young question the views of their elders to a degree never done before. More is at stake ... we believe than the mere revolt of dissidents. At issue is a change in our way of thinking about the basic nature and function of authority itself. We are now witnessing a challenge to the very idea of authority. The crisis of authority is more than a reconsideration of how authority should be expressed in society. It extends also to a reconsideration of the meaning of authority. Many of the questions now being asked about the nature and function of authority are quite healthy ones, motivated not from rebellion and revolt, but from a sincere quest to discover the true nature and locus, or loci, of authority. What is happening ... is the attempt to internalize authority, that is, to shift the basis of its verification from external and public modes to internal and private ones (Harris, 1976: 1).6 Whether one views the interpretation that the global crisis as rooted in attempts to internalize authority, or whether one focuses on the efforts to externalize authority by Islamic fundamentalists and other groups, both interpretations highlight the cruciality of the breakdown of compliance habits at all systemic levels to the emerging order of world politics. For the pervasiveness of these breakdowns has resulted in the realignment of systems and subsystems, in the transfer of legitimacy sentiments and authority habits away from one system level and toward another, thus fostering greater integration for the latter and greater disintegration for the former. If the transfer flows from a system to a subsystem, as happens much more often than transfers at the same systemic level, then it is the subgroup that gains in coherence at the expense of the system's integrity. And as the habits of compliance give way to the habits of rethinking and redirecting compliance, so do the simultaneity and expansivity of the integrative and disintegrative processes get reinforced and sustained. There is a second, even more crucial source that fosters the emergent orderliness of global life. It involves the dynamics which underlie the habits of rethinking and redirecting compliance. The analytic aptitudes of individuals, their capacity for elaborating ever more complex role scenarios that stretch out across longer periods in the future, have in recent decades undergone substantial growth throughout every region of the world, thereby facilitating and nourishing the habit of rethinking the foci and consequences of compliance. The potential and limits of these aptitudes are discussed and evidence of their growth is outlined in a subsequent section, but for the moment the reader is asked to suspend doubt and presume that such a dynamic is at work on a global scale. Acceding temporarily to this request is central to appreciating my argument that, despite the appearance of chaos, the dynamics of world affairs are patterned and orderly.</page><page sequence="15">JAMES N. ROSENAU 259 Stated most generally, the patterning occurs because the enlarged analytic aptitudes of people enable them to recognize both the virtues and the drawbacks of whole system coherence and subsystem unity, with the result that each systemic realignment contains the seeds of the next realignment as individuals redirect their legitimacy sentiments and compliance habits back and forth between the whole systems and subsystems of which they are a part. That is, as subgroups gain coherence at the expense of whole system integrity, so does it become clearer to their members with growing analytic skills that weakening the system may prove costly to them and that these costs are not offset by the gains in subsystemic coherence and effectiveness. Accordingly, the habit of rethinking compliance is revived and at some point a measure of legitimacy is redirected back again toward the whole system. Thus, to cite a recent example, it is hardly surprising that West Germany's Social Democratic Party reversed itself after its unsuccessful campaign against locating American medium-range missiles in Europe and sought to establish its credentials as a supporter of NATO and an advocate of centrist positions on foreign policy (Markham, 1984). In effect, the coherence it gained by opposing the missile deployment was subsequently recognized as too costly in terms of the advantages of more secure ties to the whole system. Similarly, to note an example in which legitimacy sentiments moved in a subgroup direction, the Catholic Church in Poland began to experience fragmentation when the coherence it gained through moderating the impact of martial law proved insufficient to withstand further governmental crackdowns. Put in still another way, there is nothing in the state of nature which enables a system to serve well all the relevant needs and wants of people. Whole systems and subsystems alike are limited in what they can accomplish. The former do poorly at providing the psychological rewards derived from a shared identity and the latter are ill-equipped to solve the material problems associated with physical security and well being. So tensions between them are bound to persist and the advent of more analytically skillful publics has inextricably linked each cascade of tensions to those that follow. In stressing the interdependence of sequential cascades, however, I do not mean to imply a process wherein systems and their subsystems normally return to a pre-existing and stable equilibrium. Sometimes that does occur, but oft-times it does not. Cascading processes may not be equilibrating devices in that oft-times the outcome of a cascade moves a system and its subsystems on to new relational patterns that are founded on a new equilibrium until such time as another cascade initiates further change. The ebbs and flows of systemic tensions, in sum, are causally connected. What seems like a chaotic crisis of authority is, in reality, an orderly set of processes whereby the simultaneity, the contrareity, and the expansivity of integrative and disintegrative tendencies form the patterned structures of an emerging global system. The ways in which these processes differentiate the emerging global order from its predecessor are presented diagrammatically through a comparison of Figures 1 and 2. These depict the global system, respectively, before and after the microelectronic revolution and the other changes outlined above. Both figures display world politics in terms of two national systems (I and II), their governments (A and B), and two of their nongovernmental subsystems (al, a2, b 1, and b2). Both Figures 1 and 2 also indicate the interaction patterns that have long marked the international scene: conventional state-to-state diplomatic relations is represented by Arrow I and those that occur between bureaucratic agencies are indicated by the dotted extensions of Arrow 1; economic aid, propaganda, and other programs directed at publics and nongovernmen- tal institutions abroad are represented by Arrows 2 and 3; the interactions and tensions</page><page sequence="16">260 A Pre- Theory Revisited The World as a System of Cascading Change A AL BL W 21 t2 3 t 111 4 5 7 8 6 + al a 10 + b2l~~1 I IT FIG. 1.

Figure 2, however, also contains Arrows 12, 13, 14, and 15, which highlight how the simultaneity, contrariety, and expansivity of systemic-subsystemic tensions at work in the world have become interlocked. While the first eleven arrows all link actors to each other, Arrows 12 through 15 distinguish links between relationships. That is, they represent the interaction that occurs between sets of interactions rather than between actors. Arrow 12 highlights the interactions that follow when tensions between a system and its subsystems become part of comparable tensions in other systems. An example</page><page sequence="17">JAMES N. ROSENAU 261 here is provided by the way in which the dynamics of a government's interaction with protesting peace groups quickly become linked to the interactions between governments and protesters in other countries. Similarly, Arrow 13 suggests the interactions that follow when tensions between a system's subsystems get interlocked into conflicts between subsystems in other systems. The spread of agitation between Islamic fundamentalists and other sects offers a good illustration of these interactive pheno- mena. Arrows 14 and 15 point to the dynamics whereby tensions within systems swiftly become part of the tensions between them, a dynamic that is readily observable in the impact of American presidential elections on Soviet-American relations. In earlier eras these several types of interlocking tensions unfolded in separate sequences as time intervened to slow down their spread (e.g., the links depicted by Arrow 12 in Figure 2 were once better represented by an Arrow 5 -+ 10 -+7 linkage). In the emerging system of today, however, the spread can be so rapid as to collapse into undifferentiated and continuous processes such as those described by Arrows 12 through 15. Stated more generally, Figure 2 makes clear that the sequences initiated by Arrows 12 through 15 enter into and become part of the internal and international politics of Systems I and II, thereby creating feedback loops that cascade change throughout the global system and infuse pattern into its chaos. In effect, the patterned disorder consists of tensions between systems and subsystems that spill over in cascading ways to exacerbate or otherwise impact on the interaction between other systems and their subsystems. And it is here, in these extended interaction sequences, that the dynamics of change operate and differentiate present-day global structures from those that have prevailed in the past. Examples of these new structures abound. Perhaps the most obvious concerns the cascading effects of Third World debts. Whether they are viewed as the origin or merely a sequence of the problem, the debts are part of a vast feedback loop that can be traced through United States deficits and high interest rates, overlending by banks, great difficulty in paying the interest and/or principal on overseas loans by such countries as Argentina, Mexico, and Poland, insistence by the IMF on austerity programs as a condition of further loans, restlessness among domestic publics protesting the austerity programs, vacillation by Third World governments in the face of domestic tensions and IMF requirements, and a host of other links which interact with each other in ways that readily conform to the patterns described in Figure 2. The question arises as to what to call the overall global structure depicted in Figure 2. Labels are important. Sound labels orient us toward our subject, the challenges it poses, and the dynamics it subsumes. Inappropriate labels, on the other hand, can be diverting, leading us either into misleading arguments over the adequacy of the nomenclature or, worse, into rejecting serious consideration of the labeled phenomena because the designations for them are grating. Both of these reactions greeted Riggs (1961), for example, when he delineated the 'prismatic system' as a political entity and offered a new terminology for probing its dynamics. But identifying an appropriate label is not easy. Just as White (1984: 23-24) had trouble 'finding a phrase for styling this decade of discontinuity' in American politics, so do global changes seem to defy labeling. Initially I stressed that the new structures amounted to an overall pattern offragmegration, a word contrived to emphasize, through its very unwieldiness, how the simultaneity and contrariety of integrative and disintegrative processes give rise to asymmetrical structures and patterned chaos (Rosenau, 1983a). Just as 'stagflation' successfully depicted new phenomena comprised of old dynamics, it was felt, so would fragmegration do the same for fragmentation and</page><page sequence="18">262 A Pre- Theory Revisited integration and thereby designate the new ways in which systemic breakdown and coherence had become interlocked. Now, however, fragmegration no longer seems compelling as a label. In addition to being awkward and sounding like excessivejargon, it does not call sufficient attention to the expansivity inherent in complex interdependence. Fragmegrative dynamics can occur within any national system, whereas a central feature of the emergent asymmetries is precisely the global spread of these dynamics via the routes suggested by Arrows 12 through 15 in Figure 2. So a more accurate and palatable label is in order. The notion of interlocking tensions that, being interlocked, derive strength and direction from each other and cascade throughout the global system suggests the utility of calling its overall structure cascading interdependence and to speak of cascading processes when referring to its dynamics. The established ways of using the term are suggestive of how closely it approximates the emergent nature of world affairs. According to the Second Edition of Webster's Dictionary, for example, a 'cascade' describes a waterfall; a particular kind of firework; a type of lace that traces 'a zigzag line in a vertical direction'; an electrical circuit in which 'the first member of the series supplies or amplifies the power of the second, and so on through the series'; a method in physics for 'attaining successively lower temperatures by utilizing the cooling effect of the expansion of one gas in condensing another less easily liquefiable'; and a technique in electrochemistry for placing 'electrolytic cells so that the electrolyte falls from one cell to the next lower in the series.' Those in the electrical field, moreover, speak of 'cascade control' in a 'cascade system' as a means of obtaining two or more speeds in a motor-driving system. Although too recent to appear in the dictionary, perhaps it is also noteworthy that an account (Schmeck, 1984: 1) of a major breakthrough in cancer research noted that experts in that field now agree that 'cancer develops in several steps' and that they refer to the entire sequence of steps as a 'cascade' leading to cancer. Since the cascade concept suggests a downward flow of causal dynamics, it should be stressed that the intent here is to refer to flows down through time and not down through hierarchically ordered systems. It is precisely the nature of cascading interdependence that the breakdown of authority structures which precipitate the flows of change can originate at any systemic or subsystemic level, at which point they can then move up and across as well as down systemic structures. It also should be emphasized, of course, that while the label serves to focus our attention on the interplay of change and constancy in global life, in itself it adds no substance. The interlocking relationships set forth in Figure 2 do not hint at any theoretical propositions. They only identify the routes along which influence traverses the global system. The next task is to specify the micro and macro components of the systemic-subsystemic tensions which constitute the dynamics that drive and sustain global life. Concrete and Abstract Units of Analysis One of the major gaps in the Pre-Theory, its silence on the basic analytic unit on which theory is to be founded, needs to be addressed if conceptual links are to be drawn between the macro and micro levels of analysis. The original formulation merely assumed that the unit had to be limited to an 'actor' to an observable entity who made calculations, framed decisions, and undertook actions-albeit the actor might vary from</page><page sequence="19">JAMES N. ROSENAU 263 single individuals to small groups such as cabinets to large collectivities such as governments. In effect, it was presumed that one started with actors and sought to theorize about their actions, a presumption which precluded treating other than concrete entities as analytic units. Most notably, it precluded formulations in which the abstract aspects of entities say, their orientations, structures, processes, or hierar- chies-could be the basic units around which inquiry might be organized (Ashley, 1984). In retrospect, this limitation seems flawed because it is the abstract and not the concrete aspects of global life that preoccupy us. The stability of structures, the limits of dominance, the breakdown of authority patterns, the coherence of subgroups, the processes of cascading interdependence, the adaptation of systems, and the dynamics of change-these are the kinds of issues that provoke our curiosities and evoke our values, and all of them involve only parts of concrete actors and not their entire beings. Stated differently, while a concrete actor may undertake an action in order to preserve or promote a particular value, oft-times we look beyond the actor and its capabilities and values to the consequences of the action for consensus-formation, systemic structure, and a host of other analytic implications of the action that are far removed from those who undertook it. Thus it seems plausible to argue that our approach to specifying basic analytic units ought to be broader. We need to allow for units that are abstract as well as those that are concrete, that are conceptual parts of entities as well as empirical wholes. That is, we need to allow for theorizing that employs analytic units derived by working back from abstract aspects of actions as well as by working forward from concrete actors. In addition to developing, say, individuals-as-actor or states-as-actor models, we ought to make room for schemes in which such abstractions as, say, roles, structures, or outcomes are posited as the basic analytic unit, as the unit that gets aggregated, that adapts, and that sustains global processes. As will be seen, the ensuing presentation outlines the possibility of treating role-derived action scripts as analytic units. Does broadening the conception of analytic units in this way render impossible the empirical tasks of identifying and tracing global patterns? I do not think so. Moving up the ladder of abstraction does not necessarily take us beyond the realm of the empirical. Indeed, by focusing on informal decision processes, international regimes, and many other 'entities' whose existence is inferred from observed behaviors, we have long been conducting inquiries from rungs high on the ladder. To be sure, the empirical tasks may be more complex because the techniques for measuring the abstract aspects of phenomena are more elaborate than those used to measure concrete phenomena. But in principle models founded on abstractions-as-units are no less subject to close scrutiny than those which employ concrete actors-as-units. States as Actors To broaden our approach to specifying the units of analysis is immediately to face the question of how we treat the increasingly fragmented nature of the 'modern State'. Quite aside from the many methodological problems associated with positing the State as the prime international actor discussed below-that is, even if one insists on employing the concept the worldwide crisis of authority can be viewed as having so thoroughly undermined the prevailing distribution of global power as to alter the significance of the State as a causal agent in the course of events. With the advent of more analytically skillful publics and the surge in subgroupism, it becomes increasingly difficult to perceive</page><page sequence="20">264 A Pre- Theory Revisited power as distributed primarily among States. Indeed, for those who see the crisis of authority as deep-seated and enduring, it no longer seems compelling to refer to the world as a State system. It is, rather, a system in which power is distributed erratically among some centralized whole systems (States) and numerous subsystems at various levels. To be sure, most whole systems on the scale of national societies still control the means of violence. Most can still draft soldiers, imprison recalcitrants, and raise taxes. But the capabilities are no longer what they used to be, now that the whole system's legitimacy is open to question, challenge, and possible rejection. The crisis of authority has reduced the relevance, salience, and potency of the State, compelling it at the very least to bargain furiously to preserve its integrity in the face of ever more demanding and competent publics and, at most, requiring it to contract its sphere of competence to those domains and subsystems where its authority remains intact. The deterioration of the Lebanese State, the precarious existence of the Argentine State, and the tortured fragility of the Polish State over the last decade may be only the most visible and extreme examples of the dynamics at work wherever societies are seeking to cohere on a national scale. Stated differently, as it is commonly used, the notion of the State connotes far more authority and autonomy than is empirically the case in today's decentralized world. (It is in order to emphasize this exaggeration that I have capitalized the first letter of the word throughout the discussion.) Perhaps an even more urgent reason to be wary of models organized around the concept of the State is the ambiguity that tends to attach to it. Not only are at least five very different definitions used to delineate its meaning (Benjamin and Duvall, 1982); but, even more importantly, none of them is operationalized in such a way as to clearly specify the empirical phenomena it embraces. On the contrary, more often than not the State is posited as a symbol without content, as an all-pervasive actor at work on the world stage whose nature, motives, and consequences are somehow too self-evident and/or powerful to warrant conceptualizing in precise and elaborate terms. Unfortunately, despite the ambiguity inherent in the concept, reliance on the State appears to have had a renaissance in recent years, with an increasing number of scholars of various theoretical persuasions abandoning systems analysis and relying on the State as the prime analytic unit. Skocpol (1982: 2-3) traces this revival to the shifting structures of world politics. Some of the very changes that are here seen as sources of cascading interdependence and thus as lessening the utility of the State as an organizing concept, she sees as conducing to greater reliance on it: 'the Pax Americana of the period after World War II' encouraged Western social scientists to focus on modernization and to treat 'spontaneous, socioeconomic and cultural processes ... (as) the primary loci of change', all of which enabled them 'to keep their eyes averted from the explanatory centrality of states as potent and autonomous organizational actors.' According to Skocpol, the 1970s were a conceptual turning point not only because of the slow and erratic pace of the knowledge generated by the 'structural-functional theories predominant in political science and sociology in the United States during the 1 950s and 1960s', but even more because the American Century came to an abrupt end in the 1970s, rendering the United States and British economies 'beleaguered ... in a world of competing national states. It is probably not surprising that, at this juncture, it became theoretically fashionable to begin to speak of "the state" as an actor and as a society-shaping institutional structure.' As Skocpol sees it, the more the United States and Great Britain appeared like other 'state-societies in an uncertain, competitive, and interdependent world of many such entities', the more did a 'paradigmatic shift . .. (get)</page><page sequence="21">JAMES N. ROSENAU 265 underway in the social sciences, a shift that involves a fundamental rethinking of the role of states in relation to societies and economies.' Krasner (1984) offers a somewhat different explanation for the resurgence of interest in the State as 'the master noun of modern political discourse'. Agreeing that vast changes have marked recent decades of global politics and that these include the rapid decline of American power, he sees the changes as highlighting the constraints at work in world affairs and, as if the operation of constraints somehow is not a form of behavior, as thus requiring the development of the different analytic equipment inherent in the concept of the State if knowledge-building progress is to be made: The more comfortable and familiar world of the 1950s and 1960s is gone. American global hegemony has eroded. 'Enlightened' policies have not ended social ills. Economic problems do not respond to conventional solutions. Third World countries will not follow the path trod by the United States. Institutional arrangements that seemed to be part of the basic nature of things have come undone. In such a world the attention of scholars will turn from behavior within a given set of institutional constraints to the constraints themselves. . . 'The state' will once again become a major concern of scholarly discourse (Krasner, 1984, 243-244). Whatever the reasons for the resurgence of the 'master noun', attempts to resurrect the State do not strike me as either necessary or desirable. To focus on institutional constraints rather than the behavior within them is neither to alter the criteria of sound empirical inquiry nor to necessitate new conceptual equipment. Such fundamental processes as those of compliance and defiance at the micro level and aggregation and adaptation at the macro level are no less central to analyzing the operation of institutional constraints as they are to comprehending the individuals and collectivities who may be constrained. Treating institutional constraints as variables rather than constants, as interactive phenomena rather than as contextual limits, does shift the level of analysis at which analysis proceeds, but it does not necessitate a change in either the methods or the basic concepts on which the analysis rests. On the contrary, casting institutional constraints as interactive phenomena subject to variation heightens the need to avoid the ambiguous and imprecise specifications and terminology that usually accompanies reliance on the concept of the State. Similarly, the fact that the United States and Britain are no longer 'unchallengeable "lead societies" ' (Skopcol, 1982: 3) neither deprives systems formulations of their utility nor lessens the ethereal tones that pervade efforts to specify the nature of the State. Indeed, it can be readily argued that the postwar distribution of global power and the subsequent decline of hegemons has made it easier to treat States as phantom-like entities that sometimes are more powerful than governments, sometimes coterminous with governments, and sometimes less encompassing than governments. In the absence of a centralized, stable, and clear-cut international hierarchy, it is difficult to specify precisely the prime movers in world politics and analysts are thus encouraged to discern the hidden hand of the State at work wherever developments seem to defy exact empirical explanation. This is not to deny that systems on the scale of national societies develop and maintain mechanisms for sustaining legal order, for controlling the means of violence, and for raising through taxation the resources necessary to the exercise of such controls. All such systems do have authorized legal, coercive, and revenue-raising institutions, and these do tend to have exclusivejurisdictions over the territories and members of their societies. But it is questionable whether anything analytic is accomplished by grouping these</page><page sequence="22">266 A Pre- Theory Revisited institutions together, as many analysts do, under the general rubric of the 'State'. Not only does such a clustering tend to elevate one's analytic eye to an abstract plane above the controls through which the goals and directions of polities are set, but it also encourages the assumption that the legal, coercive, and taxing authorities of the State are cooperatively linked together. Or, at least, such a clustering permits analysts to treat the State as a static catch-all in which its structures, processes, and values are either taken for granted or viewed as somehow managing to maintain order and to reproduce themselves across time through the socialization and coercion of its members. As a result, analyses founded on the State tend to preclude the possibility that the legal, coercive, and taxing authorities might be at odds or otherwise unable to sustain their legitimacy. The course of events in Lebanon and Poland in recent years, for example, cannot be brought into focus, much less explained, by conceiving of them in terms of the trials and tribulations of the Lebanese and Polish States. Intruding as it does an arbitrary and irrelevant level of analysis, such a formulation only compounds and obfuscates understanding; inasmuch as the two countries are only extreme instances of the crisis of authority that is now global in scope, they are perhaps best viewed as exemplary rather than exceptional cases of the problems inherent in relying on the concept of the State. In other words, while State formulations allow for administrative, legal, and coercive organizations that 'are variably structured in different countries' and thus variably 'embedded' in different governmental systems (Skocpol, 1982: 3-4), they tend not to build in dynamics that allow for change and conflict in the orientations and activities of the State. On the contrary, the central tendency is to posit the State as sovereign and its organizations as essentially integrated, thereby rendering its sovereignty complete and absolute while also insuring that change can only be superficial and transitory, since the State would not permit any deep and enduring transformations that might alter or otherwise undermine its sovereignty. Thus, endowed with an inclination and a capacity to prevent change, States are bound to be static. Unlike systems, which in both their cybernetic and structural-functionalist conceptions consist of specified processes whereby the maintenance of boundaries, the procurement of resources, and the achievement of equilibria may be altered through the conversion of inputs into outputs and/or the performance of functions by structures, States are bound to engage in actions marked by a constancy that may be as undifferentiated or as elaborate as the analyst conceives them to be.7 To some extent, admittedly, this characterization of the State as a static catch-all may be inapplicable and unfair to those analysts who argue that its conceptual revitalization is necessary to comprehending how the capitalist world economy expands and sustains itself. For them, the State is an expression of society's need to be organized for economic production and, as such, it is a central actor in the expansion and maintenance of the world economy. Thus for them it has a precise meaning which facilitates theorizing on a grand scale about the interactions among societies, economies, and global structures. It is my impression, however, that even at this theoretical level the State is treated as a constant. While such formulations allow for booms and busts in economies and for convergences and breakdowns in societies, they do not posit comparable fluctuations on the part of States. On the contrary, their tendency is to reject the relevance of decision-making, bureaucratic politics, and aroused publics as sources of variation in State behavior. Given the need for theory on a grand scale to assume away the day-to-day perturbations of politics, such a rejection may be justifiable, but it hardly makes sense with respect to the interservice rivalries, competitive belief systems, and other forms of deep-seated cleavage that can fluctuate significantly in military and</page><page sequence="23">JAMES N. ROSENAU 267 bureaucratic organizations and thereby crucially affect how the State maintains itself in the world economy. Thus, to repeat, to a large degree the State is a residual category used to explain that which is otherwise inexplicable in macro politics. It takes us back to billiard balls, to unitary actors, to reified collectivities. It obscures, even ignores, the dynamics of decision-making, bureaucratic politics, and aroused publics. It assumes the processes of aggregation and adaptation through which structures are transformed rather than highlighting the need to probe them. It dismisses the delicacy of system-subsystem relations by collecting all authority under the rubric of sovereignty instead of focusing our attention on the conditions whereby authority is created, legitimacy sustained, and compliance achieved. It denies us an ability to discern unintended consequences and to distinguish between manifest and latent functions. It encourages us to rely on intuition rather than observation, to accept anthropomorphism in place of empiricism. Roles as Analytic Units Curiously, our tendency to eschew precise conceptualization is hardly less conspicuous in our treatment of micro units as it is in our handling of macro units. For all the confusion and inconsistency that pervades analyses of the State, those that focus on the individual are just as ambiguous. Clear-cut specifications of the concept of a person rarely accompany the numerous pleas that he or she be made more central to the study of world politics. Neither those whose pleas stem largely from value considerations (e.g., Burton, 1983) nor those whose concern derives from a conceptual conviction that macro analyses must have roots in micro phenomena (e.g., North and Choucri, 1983; 444-447) express puzzlement as to what is meant by the 'individual'. Somehow it is viewed as a concept with specifications that are taken for granted, as if everyone, being an individual, knows what the concept signifies. Such a lapse in our conceptual impulses strikes me as regrettable. If micro units are to be incorporated into macro theories, then we must be as vigorous in our formulations of what we mean by the 'person' as we are in our models of the 'State', the 'regime', or any other macro units. It is not enough-indeed, it is highly misleading-to presume a world populated by the 'real individual, that awful and inconsistent person who does not fit into any convenient analytic model' (Burton, 1983: 1). Nor is it sufficient to note that people are differentiated by culture, circumstances, and prior experience. More precise understanding of what underlies individual actions is needed if our efforts at micro-macro theorizing are to avoid being thrown off course by our sentimental attachments to the worth and dignity of the individual. This reasoning proved central in revisiting the Pre-Theory's treatment of roles as micro units of analysis. More specifically, it led to exploring the possibility of treating individuals not as concrete, identifiable persons, but as complexes of roles and statuses, as members of a variety of systems that so fully account for the expectations to which they respond that nothing meaningful is left over as the quintessentially unique person. Stated even more bluntly so as to arrest attention on the need for more precise conceptualizing, there is no individual apart from the network of systems in which he or she is embedded. This is not to argue for a mechanistic view of people or otherwise to dismiss the values associated with the human spirit. Nor is it to say that people do not experience themselves and the feeling of being unique. Rather, conceiving of them as role composites provides an analytic context in which theorizing about world politics can</page><page sequence="24">268 A Pre- Theory Revisited systematically and meaningfully build in micro units expressive of needs, wants, orientations, and actions at the individual level. If it is important to argue that some undefinable variance reflective of the human spirit is left over after the expectations attached to a person's role networks are taken into account, then such an argument can readily be made without undermining a role-composite formulation. Viewed with the hindsight of 20 years, the absence of such a perspective looms as a major shortcoming of the Pre-Theory. In that original formulation the concept of role was confined to the attitudes, behaviors, and expectations that attach to top positions in the foreign policy-making process. The various role variables were, in turn, posited as competing with individual, governmental, societal, and systemic variables for influence in shaping how the occupants of the top positions made their decisions. This formulation of the sources of international action now seems too vague. It suffers from the absence of common dimensions across the five types of source variables that could serve as a basis for comparing among them. As it stands, the Pre-Theory suggests that societal and systematic variables consist of forces operating on top officials, that governmental variables involve institutional practices to which they must accommodate, that individual variables are comprised of previously acquired values which predispose them in certain directions, and that the various forces, practices, and values are in endless tension among themselves and with the expectations attached to the top roles. But how to assess the relative strength of forces, practices, values, and expectations? Clearly, it is like comparing apples and oranges. Clearly, the different variables have to be conceptualized as different types of fruit if the competition among them is to be fully discerned and cogently assessed. The concept of role readily lends itself to this need for a unifying dimension across the variables: all of them can be conceived as consisting of role expectations, the differences among them being the differences among the systems in which each role is located. That is, the individuals who make foreign policy occupy a number of roles in a number of systems and, accordingly, they are simultaneously subjected to a number of conflicting role expectations those that derive from the private systems in which they are or previously were members, from the governmental institutions in which their policy-making position is located, from the societal system for which they make policy (Holsti, 1970), and from the international systems in which their society is a subsystem as well as the expectations to which they are exposed in their top-level, face-to-face decision-making unit. The interaction among the source variables, in other words, culminates in the individual policy-maker, creating role conflicts that, in turn, reflect the different values, capabilities, and histories that differentiate the various systems in which the policy-making position is situated. Some examples are in order. Consider President Reagan's retreat from campaign pledges not to make concessions in arms control negotiations prior to a substantial defense build-up. Instead of attributing the shift in his attitudes and behavior as a response to vague forces at work on a global level, it can usefully be treated as the outcome of a competition between the expectations attached to his longtime party role as a conservative 'hawk' and those embedded in his role as the top leader of a superpower in a system marked by cross-pressures from economic exigencies, peace movements in Europe, and aroused publics at home. Similarly, Nixon's 1972 trip to China can be viewed as resulting not from an idiosyncratic trait or skill, but from the requirements of a superpower leader whose country needed more leverage in the increasingly significant Chinese-Soviet-US triad. Or consider the interpretation that John Foster Dulles's alleged religious fervor underlay his conduct as Secretary of State. Whatever the degree to which that was the case, his Secretaryship can be assessed in terms of the relative</page><page sequence="25">JAMES N. ROSENAU 269 potency of his roles in the policy-making process on the one hand and the Presbyterian Church on the other. A number of advantages flow from reconceptualizing roles as common denominators for all the source variables. In the first place, it is responsive to the plea of those who want to resurrect the individual as the prime unit of analysis. To treat the individual as a composite of identifiable and competing roles and thus as a prime site of the world's conflicts, does not, admittedly, ftilly meet the plea. Such a conception divides people up into analytical parts rather than treating each one as a whole entity. Nevertheless, it does orient attention to micro phenomena bounded by individuals as well as to that level of analysis wherein the aggregative processes that produce and differentiate collectivities and global structures originate. As the Dulles example suggests, moreover, according a central place to role expectations facilitates clarification of a research issue that for many analysts, myself included (Rosenau, 1968), has loomed large and troublesome: namely, the issue of where individuals and their idiosyncracies fit in the dynamics of world politics. At stake here are value questions pertaining to how much discretion individuals can exercise as policy-makers and empirical questions as to the extent to which the policy-making process can be randomly distorted, improved, or otherwise affected by the unique talents and beliefs that particular policy-makers might bring to their responsibilities. Although good, systematic inquiries into the vagaries of individual variables are now available (Stassen, 1972; Jervis, 1976; Etheredge, 1978; Falkowski, 1979; Hermann, 1980; Steiner, 1983; Walker, 1983), the predominant tendency has been to view them as encompassing such extensive variability as to be beyond the competence of the analyst to observe and thus as constituting a realm of global life where unknowable and unpredictable events originate. If the idiosyncratic tendencies and belief systems of policy-makers are seen as reflective of role phenomena, however, the task of accounting for the impact of individuals on world politics is eased considerably. Under this conceptualization their inexplicable actions do not have to be consigned to the unknowable. Their prior experiences and commitments are transformed from a residual category into a readily identifiable series of roles occupied in private life. Not all of the variance would be picked up this way, of course. Values derived from childhood socialization and personality traits stemming from early family experience would probably remain inaccessible. But the variance left over after treating inexplicable actions as the products of role conflicts seems likely to be much less than is presently the case. Another virtue of transforming individual, governmental, societal, and systemic variables into role phenomena is that a means is provided for systematically probing and comparing the many transnational structures, from the nongovernmental organization to the international regime, now relevant to global politics. Unlike governments, the roles comprising regimes and other transnational structures are identified not so much by formal, authoritative, and legal instruments that accord their occupants the legitimacy necessary to perform their tasks as by informal 'principles, norms, rules, and decision-making procedures' that regularize and shape behavior 'in a given area of international relations' (Krasner, 1982: 186). The presence and relevance of a regime or any transnational entity is thus not readily apparent. Informal sources of behavior are, by definition, rooted in predispositions that are both undocumented and habitual. Hence the presence of such entities and their structures must be inferred from patterned activities that cannot be traced back to formal sources. Once such entities are identified in this manner, further inferences are necessary to clarify the principles, norms, rules,</page><page sequence="26">270 A Pre- Theory Revisited and procedures that govern their behavior. And it is here that the role concept becomes valuable. For a major component of the expectations that comprise any role are the informal principles, norms, rules, and procedures that others require of its occupants and that the occupants require of themselves (Rosenau, 1968). Accordingly, viewing the leaders of regimes and other transnational entities as role occupants in systems whose goals may be in conflict with the demands of international, societal, governmental, and private systems puts them on the same analytic plane with foreign policy officials and provides a common dimension along which to observe their actions and interactions. The role concept also gives meaning to the 'given area of international relations' that defines the boundaries of a regime. What is such an area? If it has any empirical expression at all, it consists of the expectations that derive from the values at stake in a particular realm of endeavor. These values may be associated with such diverse issues as trade, security, or balance-of-payments financing-to cite the three 'cases' explored in a recent volume (Krasner, 1982) devoted exclusively to regimes-but they have in common that they are the basis for the role expectations through which the principles, norms, rules, and procedures of regimes are sustained. Conceiving the values encompassed by regime boundaries in terms of unique role expectations, moreover, makes it easier to break down and analyze the conduct of those actors, such as chiefs of state and foreign secretaries, who are active in a multiplicity of regimes. For such officials, regimes take the form of role conflicts, the analysis of which seems likely to be as revealing of the nature of regimes as of the conduct of officials. To a large extent, in other words, regimes are comparable to what were identified as 'issue-areas' in the Pre-Theory. Like regimes, issue-areas were posited as informal structures derived from, founded on, and delineated by a specifiable set of unique values contested in different ways by the individuals and groups for whom the values are especially salient. Still another advantage of giving analytic prominence to the role concept is that it serves well those who continue to have reasons to cling to the State as a central actor. Viewed as a complex of role expectations, the State is transformed from an abstract, vague, and undefined entity into a precise and observable set of phenomena. Stated simply, the State becomes the actions of those who are expected and who expect of themselves-to act on behalf of the polity rather than any other societal system or subsystem. That is, if the State has interests beyond government and party, as those who cling to the concept contend, surely the interests will be manifest in the recurrent activities of those in bureaucratic and military organizations who are expected to articulate and serve them. And, obviously, their servicing of these interests is not likely to be easily accomplished. Those who occupy State roles are not free of role conflicts. These can range widely across all the contradictory expectations that derive from the domestic disputes and international situations in which States become embroiled. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the role concept is well suited to discerning the micro dynamics of cascading interdependence. To the extent that individuals occupy multiple roles in some systems dominated by integrating processes and in others marked by fragmenting processes such as citizens in Poland and Lebanon, labor leaders in Detroit and Great Britain, or political leaders in El Salvador and France then to that extent their role conflicts are precisely those that cascade change across systems. In such conflicts individuals have to choose which roles in which systems have the greater legitimacy and which are linked to the highest authority, and the aggregate consequences of these choices then shape the flow of change throughout the global system. The confluence and simultaneity of conflicting role demands in the cognitive and</page><page sequence="27">JAMES N. ROSENAU 271 emotional space of people, in other words, has transformed them into an arena in which cascading processes flourish. Individuals have become a major battleground on which States, governments, subnational groups, international organizations, regimes, and transnational associations compete for their loyalties, thereby posing for them choices that cannot be easily ignored and that, for us as analysts, can serve as both a measure of global change and a challenge to global stability. Role Scenarios as Action Schema But the foregoing understates the potential of the role concept. Even as a common denominator across system levels, the Pre-Theory's formulation of roles as sets of formal and informal expectations experienced and held by their occupants now seems insufficient. It limits roles to static phenomena. Expectations highlight the constant constraints and opportunities attached to any role, but so defined the concept does not allow for the flexibility in role expectations that its occupant must employ as situations unfold through time. More specifically, conceived merely as a set of expectations, the concept specifies the attitudes and actions an occupant is expected to maintain in order to perform effectively in the role, but it does not anticipate what the occupants do once they confront their role conflicts and undertake action in response to one or another set of expectations. To fill this conceptual gap and infuse dynamism into role expectations, roles can be viewed as embedded in more encompassing schema, what I shall refer to as role scenarios or action scripts. These embed the expectations of any role in those more elaborate and precise premises upon which any of its occupants is likely to draw in order to depict where he or she fits in relation to other role occupants in the system as they collectively conflict, collaborate, or otherwise cope with the chores and challenges that make up the daily life of the system. In any role, in other words, we not only have an understanding of what is expected of us, but we also carry around a multitude of assumptions about how others in the relevant systems conduct themselves in relation both to us and to the problem at hand. And from these premises we derive scenarios as to how events are likely to develop as we and the others, each of us conforming to the expectations of and/or exercising the flexibilities in our role, might react to each other as the problem unfolds. To recur to the foregoing example of Reagan's role conflict in the field of arms control, the concept of action scripts enables us to understand his behavior as much more than simply a choice to favor his role as a superpower leader over his longtime party role as a conservative hawk. Presumably his decision to retreat from campaign pledges and to make negotiating concessions also sprung from a choice among conflicting scenarios in which the responses of the Soviets, the peace movement in Western Europe, and publics in the United States varied as each reacted differently, depending on whether he acted out of his hawk or superpower role. Or consider how Prime Minister Thatcher moved in a short span of 15 months from a tough to a weak stand in negotiations with the Chinese over Hong Kong, from insisting in late 1982 on Britain retaining administrative control over the territory for an indefinite period after 1997 to pressing in early 1984 for the best guarantees available from the Chinese. Her earlier position was asserted in the context of being flushed with victory in the Falklands and the domestic and international prestige that flowed from having asserted the inviolability of sovereignty in that situation. Subsequently, however, she discovered that the expectations built into the east Asian system are not those of the south Atlantic system, that the strategic and legal circumstances surrounding Hong</page><page sequence="28">272 A Pre- Theory Revisited Kong, not to mention the differences between the Argentine and Chinese armed forces, were such that the original scenario derived from a tough stand was not viable when she later occupied the British head-of-government role in the Pacific (Apple, 1984). Or consider the twice-postponed summit meeting of the Organization of African States at Addis Ababa in June, 1983. All the chiefs of state brought with them not only expectations of how they had to tailor their conduct to their own society's goals and demands, but each also had scenarios of how the others would react if their collective votes led to a seating of the delegation from the Polisario guerrilla movement. Each anticipated that a vote to seat the delegation would lead to another Moroccan-led boycott that would prevent a quorum from convening and thus give rise to a third postponement which, in turn, could have resulted in the collapse of the OAU. The aggregation of these role scenarios resulted in enough pressure on the Polisario delegation for them to 'voluntarily and temporarily' relinquish their seat, a decision which permitted the nineteenth summit meeting to get underway. To conclude that the Polisario delegation bowed to pressure, however, is to overlook the full richness provided by action scripts as analytic tools. For presumably members of the Polisario delegation also made a choice among their own role scenarios, in the end preferring not to risk evoking the scenario in which they would lose the support of their African allies and be perceived as having brought about the OAU's demise. The centrality of role scenarios is also evident in the interaction dynamics that occur within as well as between governments. In the United States, for example, all of the key role occupants in the policy-making process are familiar with the goals, calculations, constraints, and conflicts that the others experience in their multiple roles. Thus all of them can envision a variety of outcomes ensuing from their interaction over any salient foreign policy issue. More specifically, they can envision the various stages through which different interaction sequences will unfold and culminate as, at each stage, each of them chooses to resolve their other role conflicts in one or another way. The Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives knows that if he is responsive to the partisan requirements of his party role rather than the bipartisan expectations of his govern- mental role on, say, the question of El Salvador, the Republican President's reactions are likely to vary accordingly, as will those of the Secretary of State, the Senate Minority leader, the pro- and anti-military aid factions in the House, and any other role occupants whose responsibilities may be evoked by the issue. In one important respect the foregoing examples are misleading. They imply that the relevance of role scenarios is confined to the analysis of decision-making. Certainly they are central to the ways in which individuals and bureaucracies frame and make their choices, but the reasoning and reactions of officials is not the only level at which action scripts are core phenomena. They are also the basis on which publics participate in global life, with choices among various scenarios underlying the degree to which they are active and the direction which their collective actions take. Stated more emphatically, role scenarios are among the basic understandings and values that are transmitted through political socialization and that sustain collectivities across generations. As such, as culturally derived premises for relating to the political arena, they are also among the prime phenomena that get aggregated when the energies of a collectivity are mobilized and concerted around goals. Put in still another way, the task of leadership is that of selling action scripts, of getting publics to regard one set of scripts as more viable and valid than any other they may find compelling. It follows that faltering role scenarios lie at the center of the authority crises on which cascading interdependence thrives. Whether it be a small group, a city, a nation-state, or</page><page sequence="29">JAMES N. ROSENAU 273 an international system, the glue that keeps collectivities cohesive and enables them to reproduce themselves includes a set of shared action scripts that depict who has legitimacy and authority in a collectivity and how all concerned will and should respond when the authority is exercised. Such scripts are, in effect, theories of how collectivities resolve their problems; and, like us in relation to our theories of world politics, the members and officials of collectivities are normally prisoners of such theories. They are so habituated to the scripts which sustain and reproduce the authority structures that their compliance within them is taken for granted and normally they are unlikely to be aware that they are performing in their designated roles. When legitimacy becomes questionable, however, authority-based action scripts quickly surface into consciousness and scenarios involving noncompliance and the redirection of legitimacy sentiments quickly emerge as alternative courses of action. At that point a collectivity goes into crisis because the very basis for organizing its efforts is undermined and undergoes transformation, giving rise thereby to tensions which intrude into the action scripts of other collectivities and then cascade as widely and pervasively throughout the global system as authority structures elsewhere are in flux. A good, current example of how the action scripts of publics can become inextricably linked into cascading processes is provided by the activities of Western peace movements in response to the deployment of new weapons systems in Europe. Both the ordinary citizen and the movement's leaders had to make choices among scripts in which their actions might differentially affect the coherence of their organizations, the effectiveness of their governments, the stability of NATO, the negotiating postures of the Soviets, the orientations of the Reagan Administration, and the prospects for cooling down or heating up the arms race. A number of these scenarios, perhaps even all of them, are also illustrative of the concept's relevance to the central concern of this inquiry. Looked at from any perspective, be it that of the peace groups, NATO, its member governments, or the Soviet Union, most of the plausible scenarios doubtless contained a number of segments which depicted the chaos that can follow when role conflicts are resolved in favor of systemic or subsystemic expectations during a period of cascading interdepen- dence. Whether applied to micro decision-making activities or macro collective actions, role scenarios are at once issue-specific and generalized in their scope. That is, while they are framed in the context of particular issues, they are not transitory in the same way issues are. Issues come and go, but the scenarios anticipating their course are based on the more enduring understandings which the occupants of any role are likely to have of the opportunities, constraints, and conflicts built into the other roles comprising the system. In effect, the scenarios reflect the comprehension attached to any role of how the system functions its goals, procedures, cultural premises, capabilities, and historical pat- terns both in general and in relation to particular issues. Note that the scenarios are inherent in the role and not in its occupants. Different occupants may resolve a role's conflicts differently, but such resolutions are likely to be founded on similar conceptions of the alternative scenarios that are in conflict. Why? Because the scenarios are the action side of a role's expectations: in experiencing and learning the expectations, the role's occupants also become knowledgeable about the dynamics of the other roles in the system and the contingencies that thus underlie the interactions among them. That is, they cannot learn about the opportunities and limitations built into their own roles without at least a minimal grasp of the requirements faced by the occupants of other roles with whom they must interact. Thus, there are no role expectations divorced from the systems in which the roles are lodged, and thus there can be no system without</page><page sequence="30">274 A Pre- Theory Revisited role-derived scenarios among which its members chose as they sustain or change its patterns through time. This is in no way to imply that role scenarios are clear-cut, orderly, logical, or in any other way standardized. They may well be akin, rather, to what has been called 'working knowledge' that 'organized body of knowledge that administrators and policy-makers use spontaneously and routinely in the context of their work', including 'the entire array of beliefs, assumptions, interests, and experiences that influence the behavior of individuals at work' (Kennedy, 1983: 193-194). Role scenarios can be thought of as translating these arrays of understanding into diverse paths that stretch into and anticipate the future, with each path consisting of segments that are linked by and fan out from choice points and with movement along any segment being a consequence of the interactive expectations held and choices made by all the participants whose paths cross in a situation. At each choice point in a scenario, moreover, new segments may be introduced as the prior interactions create new circumstances that tap working knowledge in different ways and divert the path onto a new course. Thus, beyond the framework of segmented paths to and from the decision points in a situation, action scripts are anything but standardized. Founded on a composite of beliefs, assumptions, interests, and experiences as well as observation and information, their segments may form paths that are long or short, straight or circuitous, clear or obscure, continuous or broken to mention only a few of the dimensions along which variation can occur. And the more that cascading processes are part of a situation, of course, the greater is the likelihood of extensive and rapid fluctuations along these dimensions. Role scenarios are as operative under chaotic conditions as under orderly ones, but their length, direction, clarity, and continuity are likely to be highly volatile the more changes cascade upon each other. It follows that role scenarios are likely to be marked by a tension between their tendency toward complexity and the limits to which their complexity can be comprehended. The complexity derives from the fact that an action script can potentially embrace a great number and variety of segments, as many permutations and combinations as those occupying multiple roles are able to manage in anticipating how the choices they make among competing role expectations will interact sequentially with the alternative choices others in the system may make. One can begin to appreciate the complexity of interactive scenarios by thinking of their paths metaphorically as maps of the system, with decision routes tracing how the choices made by the relevant actors criss-cross and diverge as each selects one scenario rather than another, thereby sending the unfolding sequence of choices off in a new direction. Viewed from the perspective of an observer outside the system, the decision routes either move forward to the conclusion of an issue or they are marked by circularity and back-and-forth vacillation as the choices made by the role occupants offset, negate, or otherwise fall short of the collaboration necessary to a resolution of the situation. Viewed from the perspective of any of the role occupants, the issue maps lie at the core of their activities and either (for the pragmatist) serve to guide the pursuit of their goals in the context of what is feasible or (for the idealist) highlight the obstacles that hinder the realization of their values.8 But as scenarios tend toward increasing complexity, so do the constraints against playing out in the imagination all the segments they might encompass. There is, it seems reasonable to hypothesize, a high correlation between the length and clarity of a scenario: other things being equal,9 the longer and more diffuse it is i.e., the greater the number of choice points through which it fans out from Time 1-the more obscure will be its segments at the distant ends (Time n) and the more clear-cut will be those in the</page><page sequence="31">JAMES N. ROSENAU 275 near future (say, Times 2 and 3). Why? Because anticipating the path beyond a few segments involves managing a great deal of complex information and confronting a great number of hypothetical situations for which prior experience provides no guide, and this combination of complexity and uncertainty tends to curb the inclination to be precise as scenarios stretch further into the future. With so many segments having fanned out by Time n, anticipating likelihoods begins to appear impossible. Thus, citizens and officials alike either tend to fall back on the early segments and to settle for the obscurity that appears to envelope the later ones or they presume that somehow the path will ultimately lead them in the direction they want to go even though the intervening segments are shrouded in obscurity. Consider, for example, acting at Time 1 in a conflict with two other participants, each of which might move in three new directions at each new stage of the unfolding situation. By the time the fourth choice point arrives the situation might well require information about and demand imaginative forecasting of dozens of possible scenario segments along which the conflict might evolve, a challenge that even the more skilled role occupants would probably want to simplify either by treating some segments at Time 4 as 'unrealistic' or by otherwise assuming that they comprehend the organizing principles which underlie interaction in the situation and guide its path through the several choice points. The expectations attached to roles also operate as constraints that keep scenarios both streamlined and stretched toward Time n. A number of the possible segments that can fan out from future choice points are likely to require action which exceeds the maximum leeway that a role permits its occupants to exercise. At Time 3, for example, a scenario might require a foreign secretary to undertake initiatives that he could not pursue without prior cabinet or legislative approval. Or consider the informal role expectations involved in the deployment of new weaponry in Europe. Doubtless leaders of the peace movement excluded from their scenarios those segments which might have flowed from choices that allowed for missile deployment in exchange for future compromises in arms control negotiations. Similarly, surely the key NATO governments managed to simplify their action scripts by dismissing a choice point in which they agreed to postpone deployment. Hence, on the grounds that the course must be stayed and that the commitment to goals is unwavering, the tendency toward complexity is often limited and the anticipated paths into the future kept straighter, longer, and more continuous than might otherwise be the case. Whatever may be the bases for keeping role scenarios streamlined, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the longer people occupy a role, the more elaborate will be their scenarios. Indeed, the more elaborate a person's scripts become, the more is that person thought to have political wisdom. For, if the term means anything as it is normally used, political wisdom refers to an astute knowledge of a system and an ability to anticipate how its key actors are likely to conduct themselves under varying circumstances which is another way of saying that those who are politically wise are able to juggle a more extensive set of scenarios than most people. Their 'horizons of observability' to use an apt phrase employed by sociologists to describe the distance in a communications network beyond which people are unlikely to be aware of the role performance of others (Friedkin, 1983) stretch widely across the relevant systems. The more elaborate a role scenario is, of course, the more does it encompass all the varied sources out of which action flows. Virtually by definition, for example, wise politicians develop their scenarios out of their general perceptions and knowledge of the other relevant roles and their specific information about the goals the others may seek, the means they may consider, the capabilities they may have available, the cost-benefit</page><page sequence="32">276 A Pre- Theory Revisited calculations they may make, and the support they may mobilize all of this in the context of how their own choices might variously affect the choices and scenarios of the others. While role scenarios include game-theoretical calculations as to how the various role occupants may bluff, threaten, or otherwise seek to enhance desired outcomes through strategic posturing in their interactions with each other, it would be erroneous to conclude that the concept of action scripts requires us to depend on game theory for our analyses. The concept posits role scenarios as empirical phenomena, as action-oriented premises held by role occupants, and not as hypothetical constructs employed by rational actors.10 Being inherent in the dynamics of any system, in other words, role scenarios are observable. They can be discerned in the position papers prepared for decision-makers, in the public accountings of their actions and what they hope to achieve, in the problems they encounter and the choices they make. And scenarios can also be empirically traced in the claims and actions of citizens, in the enduring collaborative and conflictful patterns of collectivities, and in the stalemates and transformations of international systems. Game-theoretical analysis can be useful in assessing the options open to a role occupant, but it is quite secondary if the analyst's task is defined as one of estimating how and why the occupant did or might behave in a particular way or of comprehending how diverse role scenarios aggregate to one system putcome rather than another. Furthermore, as noted, action scripts derive from deeply engrained, subconscious predispositions as well as explicit, analytic assessments. The decision routes of scenarios are sustained as much by unstated cultural premises (such as challenges should be met, friends should be rewarded, or alternatives should be considered) and historical memories (such as dictators cannot be trusted, organizations can be paralyzed by inertia, and unruly mobs can foment change) as by current role requirements and situational imperatives. From early in childhood we acquire the 'givens' of social interaction, the inclinations, perceptions, and values through which role expectations are filtered and structured, and as these implicit orientations cumulate into working knowledge across time they increasingly serve as guides to the behavior of others as well as sources of our own conduct. Thus, for example, the scenarios that Western officials and publics developed after a Soviet fighter shot down a Korean airliner consisted not only of decision points shaped by the on-going arms control negotiations, but also by the cultural premise that killing innocent civilians is unacceptable and the historical memory that the Russians are obsessed with territorial security. Given the extent to which role scenarios are compounded out of unspoken, tacit assumptions, they can hardly serve as the basis for game theoretical calculations. However, as previously noted and as will be seen in greater detail, the subconscious components of action scripts are the basis of a more important function: through socialization and the transmission of culture they serve as the underlying foundations from which aggregative processes derive and thereby sustain collectivities across generations. That action scripts are compounded out of tacit and deeply engrained premises as well as explicit and current role expectations also accounts for the capacity of individuals, officials and citizens alike, to draw on a multitude of scripts as they respond to the vast array of issues that may evoke their interest. Every culture has its own logic, its own self-contained values and symbols for interpreting and adapting to any challenge, and thus those socialized into it never want for the ability to concoct scenarios for coping with the many ongoing situations and the few unexpected developments that claim their</page><page sequence="33">JAMES N. ROSENAU 277 attention at any one time. The individuals need not be well informed, and they may even be uninformed, about a situation in order to respond to it. Nor do they need to have clear and elaborate pictures of future choice points and the scripts that connect them. The rich and all-encompassing values and presumptions of their culture will always enable them to develop competing scenarios in which they can fit themselves as well as the others involved in the problem. It follows that integrated and consensual role scenarios are the glue that holds collectivities together, just as discrepant and competitive scenarios are the acid that paralyze or tear them apart. Depending on whether or not they are widely shared, therefore, action schema can underlie system stability or they can foment system collapse. No less important, and as noted below in greater detail, the extent to which they are shared by a system's role occupants either facilitates aggregation or it contributes to disaggregation. In a general sense, in other words, a collectivity is no more coherent than the degree to which its mernbers share an appreciation of the different scenarios that may ensue when they do or do not support the processes whereby policies are framed and implemented. In a specific policy sense the degree of agreement among scenarios relevant to how an issue will unfold anticipates the degree to which the policies pursued will be supported and, accordingly, effective. Thus some of Solidarity's calls to rally were successful because enough members perceived that the greater the number who marched under threatening circumstances, the greater would be the effect on the Polish government and the union's friends and adversaries abroad. And thus, too, can those rallies that failed be attributed to the pervasiveness of alternative scenarios among the union's membership in which the consequences of arrest or violence were seen as too great vis-a-vis the perceived impact of a large turnout on governmental and other actors. Similarly, the effectiveness of US foreign policy in, say, Central America will correspond closely to the degree to which legislative and executive officials frame policies on the basis of shared scenarios of what will happen in the region as a consequence of one or another level of US military and economic aid. In the same manner widespread and rapid shifts in the shared action schema of a system's members can be said to underlie the momentum and success of revolutionary movements and any other changes that profoundly alter the system's structures. For example, at some point in Iran, perhaps upon Khomeini's return from France, the scenario of a successful overthrow of the Shah became viable as well as desirable for millions of Iranians and their collective actions that followed proved this assessment to be sound. Indeed, as will be seen, the convergence of a society around new role scenarios quintessentially reveals the aggregative dynamics that underlie system transformations. " But how do role occupants converge around common scenarios? Under what circumstances do their choices among scenarios enhance subsystem integration at the expense of system fragmentation (or vice versa)? To examine these'questions our analytic focus must shift from the micro level of role occupants to a macro concern with the dynamics of collectivities as aggregative and adaptive entities caught up in the turbulence of cascading processes. The need for such a focus is even more compelling when the full extent of the declining effectiveness of governments is taken into account. Governments as Actors Although the Pre-Theory is pervaded with caution as to the extent to which foreign policies can promote desired or prevent unwanted changes abroad, upon rereading it</page><page sequence="34">278 A Pre- Theory Revisited appears to be founded on a presumption that governments, as the prime precipitants of global processes, have considerable leeway in how they conduct themselves abroad. Given their declining effectiveness noted earlier, this presumption now seems open to question. Or at least a more clear-cut delineation of the limits to which they are locked into certain foreign policies by changing societal and systemic structures seems in order. To posit governments as less and less effective is, once again, to pose a problem of perspective and measurement. Some would contest the assertion of declining effectivenes by arguing that governments have never been very effective, that they have always been caught up in a crisis of legitimacy, and that current trends are thus mere fluctuations in a long-standing pattern. Others would contend that the assertion is based on impressionis- tic evidence and that it needs to be checked out with systematic time-series data. I do not quarrel with these points. What follows, admittedly, is not based on rigorous longitudinal data because materials relevant to what is meant here by declining effectiveness have not been compiled. Hence it may well be that the postulated trend line of declining effectiveness distorts and/or exaggerates the underlying processes of governance at work in the world. Nevertheless, the impression of declining effectiveness is not easily dispelled and, in any event, there is much to be said for proceeding as if it is descriptive of underlying trends and then exploring the theoretical implications of such a presumption. By declining effectiveness I have in mind a progressive inability on the part of governments to provide their clients (elites, citizenries, allies, adversaries) with the conditions and services that reflect the goals they have set for themselves and that their clients expect. Effectiveness, then, is more than the maintenance of order. It involves the solving of problems and the resolving of issues, or at least preventing the worsening of problems and the escalation of issues. Stated differently, effectiveness pertains to policy outputs, to tangible services such as highways and unemployment checks and to intangible conditions such as a feeling of physical security and a sense of optimism about what the future holds. It is in this sense that the impression of a decline in governmental capabilities looms large. Compared to earlier periods of this century when politicians were heroes because they delivered on promises and thus held high office for relatively long times, not to mention earlier centuries when foreign policy was the sport of kings, the performance records of modern governments seem conspicuously meager. Whether they be democratic or authoritarian, Western or Eastern, the outcomes of their efforts seem increasingly to fall far short of their aspirations. As Shils puts it (1982: 25), the conditions under which the tasks of government can be performed efficaciously no longer obtain in any country, advanced and rich or backward and poor. Everywhere there are clamorous demands for a great variety of governmental actions reaching deeply into society and extending over its entire breadth, and everywhere governments have undertaken to attempt to satisfy these demands. It is a hopeless undertaking ... it is difficult for any group to stay in power for long except through yielding to demands. . . These are among the reasons why the rate of inflation is so high in so many countries and why the rate of growth of investment in the maintenance of physical capital lags behind the rate of growth of consumption. To be sure, the capacity of governments to maintain order through strong-arm methods may not have lessened perhaps it is even greater than ever but the achievement of obedience and compliance through the exercise of force is, in no way, a measure of effectiveness, of whether a government is performing its expected tasks and</page><page sequence="35">JAMES N. ROSENAU 279 getting its jobs done. And if the political skills of publics are becoming ever more refined (as suggested below), even the maintenance of order may prove to be increasingly difficult, as such diverse regimes as those in Chile, France, Peru, the Philippines, and Poland have recently discovered. Indeed, it is hardly surprising that the progressive decline in effective governance has been accompanied by a corresponding emergence and growth of 'political risk analysis' as an intellectual enterprise undertaken by banks, insurance companies, governmental intelligence agencies, and many other organiza- tions that need to reduce uncertainty about the future. Viewed in terms of outputs, effectiveness is not easily measured. Ideally it should be traced in the attitudes and behavior of those toward whom the outputs are directed, in the orientations and activities of elites and citizenries in the case of domestic policies and in the responses of allies and adversaries in the case of foreign policies. Systematically observing and then aggregating such phenomena presents, obviously, enormous difficulties and most analysts have thus been compelled to employ 'crude' measures, such as whether governments held a legislative majority for three-fourths of a decade (Powell, 1982: 18-19), that are hardly more satisfactory or less crude than the widely shared impression of ineffectiveness derived from such developments as the total breakdown of governmental authority in Poland, Lebanon, and Northern Ireland, the persistence of high unemployment in all parts of the world, the failure of agricultural policies in the communist world, the existence of underground economies, the unyielding resistance of the Afghans to Soviet power, the inability of the United States to get desired solutions in Central America and the Middle East, the outbreak of riots in France, the advent of mutinies in the PLO, and so on through a seemingly endless series of episodes expressive of governments that are unable to provide elemental conditions and services.12 Effectiveness, of course, is not the only criterion by which governments can and should be evaluated. Stability and openness may be equally important criterion, and in some instances their records in these respects may be more impressive. From the perspective of governments as actors constrained in the conduct of foreign policy by the structures of domestic and international life, however, the criterion of effectiveness is especially relevant. For the greater the decline in the capacities of governments to realize their goals, the greater is the likelihood of resistance to their policies and erosion of their legitimacy, consequences which, in turn, detract further from their effectiveness. And as Inglehart (1977: 14-15) cogently demonstrates, the more governments seek to alter their course so as to increase their effectiveness, the greater the likelihood of intensified active resistance to their efforts. It is no mere coincidence, for example, that rioting in France followed a new governmental initiative to cope with inflation and that mutinies in the PLO followed Arafat's movement toward accommodation with Lebanon. Whether the decline in governmental effectiveness is a cause or a consequence of a counter trend toward increased authority and legitimacy attaching to nongovernmental collectivities and doubtless it is both a cause and a consequence the result is the same: those occupying roles in foreign-policy-making systems have limited room for innova- tion. Internally they are constrained from undertaking new policies by the absence of widespread consensuses and by the demands of more coherent and adamant groups, while externally their initiatives are limited both by the comparable circumstances of the governments with which they must negotiate and by the demands of more coherent and capable transnational actors. Societal and systemic variables, in short, have locked governments into long-standing policies, and even the well-established policies may prove increasingly difficult to maintain if the global crisis of authority continues to intensify and cascades tensions</page><page sequence="36">280 A Pre- Theory Revisited along the many fault lines of cleavage. Viewed from this perspective, Sadat's trip to Jerusalem looms as an extraordinary event, one of those exceedingly rare instances when a national leader broke free of the locks that sustain the continuities of world politics. Much more indicative of the vice-like grip of societal and systemic variables is the way in which Polish officials have been constrained by the rise of Solidarity and the malaise that has followed their destruction of it. In Western democracies, at least, much the same can be said about governmental variables: the polarization and volatility of voters in Western democracies has led to minority cabinets, fragile coalitions, frequent turnovers, and stalemated policy-making processes that add further to the constraints upon those in high office. My collaborative research with Holsti (Rosenau and Holsti, 1983; Holsti and Rosenau, 1984) on the foreign policy belief systems of American leaders is poignantly illustrative in this regard. Our findings clearly point to enduring cleavages and the absence of consensus in the United States that seem bound to conduce to vacillation rather than innovation in the policy-making process. In the absence of any dramatic consensus-forming event, and the likelihood of such an occurrence seems very remote, present and future American policy-makers appear to have little control over what they can undertake, much less accomplish, in foreign affairs. To posit governments as severely and increasingly circumscribed by domestic and foreign constraints, however, is not to say that they have ceased being prime actors on the international stage. Far from it: governments continue to enjoy considerable authority and (with a few notable exceptions) legitimacy. Their foreign policies are still the most conspicuous and pervasive actions on the stage. In the swirls and counterswirls of cascading processes they are the focal points, the managers of change, even if diminished in their capabilities and more constrained in their leeway. More specifically, governments are not so locked into their contextual circumstances that they have lost their ability to adapt to the converging demands from at home and abroad. They still retain a full array of adaptive mechanisms for bargaining, synthesizing, or otherwise playing the various demands off against each other and thereby maintaining their identity as collectivities. And in so doing they can still exert influence, commit blunders, press for compliance, and meet challenges. The reasons to theorize about foreign policy, in short, are no less compelling than ever. But the theory must now be more sensitive to the contextual constraints and the adaptations that are made to the demands inherent in them. In addition to acknowledging the declining effectiveness of governments, now our theorizing needs to account for the vacuums thereby created. In addition to focusing on government-to- government interactions over particular issues, now foreign policy theory needs to expand its conceptual storehouse and proceed as if multi-actor situations and linkages across system levels and issue areas constitute the normal conditions under which governments frame and implement their policies. In addition to assessing outcomes in terms of direct responses to stimuli, now our theories need to include circuitous responses to layers of stimuli filtered through a variety of indirect channels. This means that we need to explore more fully how foreign policy officials share their authority and coordinate their actions with subsystem leaders at home and those abroad who occupy top roles in transnational organizations and international regimes. It means that we need to be more conversant with the concept of compliance and, following Young (1979), more alert to the variability of the conditions under which actors do and do not modify their behavior in response to prior stimuli. It means that we have to be ready to treat the structures of world politics as structures of authority in which the unfolding of</page><page sequence="37">JAMES N. ROSENAU 281 events may be due as much to the legitimacy that attaches to actions as to the capabilities that back them up. The Aggregation of Collective Actors The decline of governmental effectiveness and the increasing relevance of contextual constraints and multi-actor situations point up the need for theories of foreign policy that encompass the dynamics whereby roles and their scenarios get aggregated into collectivities and the processes whereby the collectivities then adapt to threats and challenges. The more crises of authority cascade subgroupism across the global landscape, the more extensive is the disaggregation of wholes into parts that, in turn, either get aggregated or incorporated into new wholes. That is, cascading interdepen- dence can readily be viewed as continuous processes of systemic formation and reformation, and the concept of aggregation offers perhaps the only means for comprehending how and why they unfold as they do. Stated more sweepingly, not until such time as we can account for, first, the transformation of micro action scripts into the behavior of macro collectivities and, second, the aggregation of macro collectivities into global structures, can we expect to move from pre-theories to theories that encompass the dynamics outlined in Figure 2. To repeat a deeply held conviction, macro structures do not exist entirely apart from their micro components, and in a period of enormous change, cascading processes, and multi-actor situations it would be folly to assume that the links and tensions between micro and macro units are sustained as they always have been. To speak of the formation of structured and purposeful collectivities is to refer to a process that is never automatic, that is sometimes circuitous, that is often obscure, and that is endlessly awesome. It is awesome because the disparate individuals that comprise a modern collectivity do not know each other, much less interact directly, and yet somehow they acquire coherence and structure as a collective actor which develops, possesses, and uses resources on behalf of goals. How does this occur? Anticipating the ensuing discussion, it occurs through a process of aggregation in which the individuals are seen, and see themselves, as parts that sum to a whole which, as such, is differentiated from other wholes and exists as a reality in the minds of both those who occupy its roles and those external to it who must take its existence into account. The summing of the parts is carried out and proclaimed by those who seek to organize and mobilize them in a particular way for particular purposes; concurrently, the sum is found compelling as a role scenario by those who form its parts and, as the sharing of the scenario spreads and acquires legitimacy, the collectivity takes on a life of its own. Subsequently, whatever its nature and goals whether it is weak or strong, system or subsystem, government or transnational association, international regime or revolutionary movement the collectivity persists and survives only as long as the role scenarios and interaction patterns that identify its existence are consistent with their available resources and are thus meaningful in the minds and memories of those touched by the policies pursued on their behalf. That is, a collectivity endures only as long as its policies lead to successful adaptations to changing circumstances that reinforce the action scripts, authority structures, and compliance patterns on which its perceived existence rests. Normally, the longer a collectivity survives, the more does it accumulate written records and unwritten traditions that form deeply engrained cultural premises which, in turn, reinforce the expectations and scenarios embedded in its roles occupied by succeeding generations of individuals whose actions sustain the aggregative sequences.</page><page sequence="38">282 A Pre- Theory Revisited This is not to imply, however, that the formation and maintenance of collectivities is a one-way process, that they come into being and persist only because micro units share the same basic values and thus converge around the same action scripts. On the contrary, their formation and continuation is profoundly a two-way process, with the collectivities and their implementing organizations serving to define and shape the values and orientations of their role occupants who, in turn, act to sustain the collectivities. Aggregation, in other words, is inescapably an interaction process, with the micro units limiting the scope of macro structures and with macro structures narrowing and guiding the contribution of micro units. Stated in still another way, aggregation involves two realities, one of individuals who occupy specific roles and one of collectivities that consist of systems of interconnected roles which are widely differentiated and labeled as such by the individuals who, needing to infuse structure into their worlds, conduct themselves in terms of the systemic structures they have articulated with their labels. In turn, the norms underlying this conduct become habitual and institutionalized, thereby reinforcing role expectations and insuring the persistence of collectivities across time. From this interactive perspective the question of what comes first in the formation and maintenance of collectivities is essentially trivial. Micro units and macro structures are products of each other and it does not matter in what order they originally surfaced. It bears re-emphasizing, however, that notwithstanding their duration and the awesomeness of their coherence, collectivities are always susceptible to change and collapse. Cascading dynamics can engulf the micro roles of which they are composed, raise the salience of other systems, or otherwise alter their expectations such that habits and institutions break down and collectivities are thereby transformed. This is why we can never take micro units for granted in our macro inquiries. In sum, collectivities consist of shared action schemas to which meaning is attached in the reality world of the mind, but as such they are very much alive and thus are, for all practical purposes, living units that act and react, press and retreat, conform and deviate, or otherwise pursue that vast range of behaviors which preoccupy students of world politics. To comprehend these behaviors, however, it is not enough simply to assume either the processes of aggregation whereby micro parts are fused into macro wholes or the processes of adaptation whereby the macro wholes sustain a balance between the internal and external demands that press upon them. Collectivities can take many forms and can evolve in a number of directions, and such differences cannot be understood unless we are able to trace how the capabilities of collectivities expand, contract, or otherwise undergo change in the support they can bring to bear on behalf of their goals. That is, we need to specify the dynamics of aggregation and adaptation. As noted, the key to casting aggregative processes into a theoretical context lies in positing them as resulting in variable sums, as adding up to macro wholes that are sometimes greater and sometimes lesser than the sum of their micro parts, and then assessing how, when, and why the summing occurs one way rather than another. Under what conditions is the interaction between micro and macro units susceptible to aggregation? At what points and through what mechanisms do the wholes become greater than the sums of their parts? And when do the parts add to less than the whole? When is the possible existence of either a greater or lesser sum recognized? Who does the summing? How is the presence of the summed whole articulated and proclaimed? What political consequences follow from the publicity attendant upon its articulation? Why are some sums accepted as valid while the accuracy of others are contested? How does an</page><page sequence="39">JAMES N. ROSENAU 283 aggregated sum get transformed into a collectivity? When does a sum need to be recalculated or rearticulated for a collectivity to retain its vitality in politics? Are the processes and politics of disaggregation, of wholes unraveling either into lesser sums or into parts no longer summable, comparable to those of aggregation? Building on a previous formulation that focused on the motivational sources of aggregative processes (Rosenau, 1980: 79-82), these questions can be addressed here by distinguishing between unintentional and participatory aggregations and by noting how the former get transformed into the latter. To differentiate between these two types of aggregations is to stress that not all aggregative processes culminate in collectivities. Some give rise simply to aggregations, that is, to wholes which lack the organizational and purposeful characteristics of collectivities and, consequently, which are exactly equal to, and never more nor less than, their parts. These are unintended aggregations, and they are always equal to the sum of their parts because politics, by definition, does not intervene to count the parts or contest the sums. Unintended aggregation occurs when a multiplicity of role occupants undertake similar but unrelated behavior to serve their own purposes. Each action is designed to advance each role occupant's goals or otherwise meet his or her needs, but because the actions are all similar even though the goals or needs may be diverse, the actions are summable. If the similar actions are relevant to the concerns of those such as journalists, scholars, bureaucrats, or politicians who are expected in their professional roles to be alert to change, then the patterns they form will eventually be recognized, summed, and publicized. Once note has thus been taken of the similar behaviors, they can be said to form a whole even though the parts may be neither interactive nor connected. Depending on how it is perceived and publicized, the unintended aggregation can thus become the target of public policies and the core of international issues. Population explosions, resource shortages, or financial crises are cases in point. A family has a child, fills its car with gasoline, or purchases a television set made abroad unconcerned that elsewhere millions of families are doing the same. When the cumulative implications of these private acts (the people crunch, the energy crunch, or the trade imbalance) are discerned, evaluated, and proclaimed by observers or spokespersons for collectivities, the aggregated sum enters the public arena and feeds into the structures and processes of world politics. This is not to suggest that world politics is essentially a process of consciousness-rais- ing. The sums get calculated whether or not people are aware of the public consequences of their private actions, and more often than not they are unlikely to be cognizant of the leadership summations to which they have contributed. Of course, lengthy time lags may ensue between the cumulation of micro patterns and the public acknowledgement of them by leaders of macro collectivities. Indeed, it is the discrepancy between unintended aggregations and their activation on the agenda of world politics that, in effect, describes the informal and latent structures of international systems. Prior to the identification of an aggregation, or during subsequent periods when it is quiescent as a public issue, policy-makers for collectivities may unknowingly encounter the opportunities and limitations inherent in the aggregate patterns while making decisions and launching undertakings relevant to the issues then on the global agenda. The aggregate consequences of population explosions or of widespread distrust of government, for example, were surely encountered by politicians long before their explicit recognition as a public problem was articulated. Unintended aggregations, in other words, can operate as basic parameters of global processes to the extent they limit or channel the scope or direction of those processes. As such, the aggregations are</page><page sequence="40">284 A Pre- Theory Revisited informal and latent structures unarticulated givens for politicians that are no less important links between micro parts and macro wholes for being deeply buried in the responses of policy-makers to the issues they confront. The time lag between the recognition and the articulation of unintended aggregations helps clarify how the whole becomes different from the sum of its parts. During that period, word of such an aggregation having been identified spreads, in academic circles, legislative corridors, and editorial boards as well as among interest groups, opportunistic politicians, and public servants; as word spreads and the circumstances that led to the recognition of the unintended patterns intensify, the existence of the aggregation, its meaning, relevance, and future development, increasingly becomes salient as a problem and a source of contention. At some point one or another of those involved in recognizing and assessing the aggregation find reasons to publicly proclaim its existence as a matter of concern. If the public surfacing of the pattern leads to further debate, the aggregation can be said to have become a political issue and to be headed for a place on the political agenda. And the more such an aggregation gets politicized, of course, the less is it merely a sum of micro parts and the more does it undergo transformation from a parameter to a variable in world politics. That is, the very fact of being the focus of public attention makes the unintended aggregation something different than it previously had been. However accurate the proclamation of a sum may be and often the initial contention over the issue involves arguments over what the correct sum is it serves as a basis for subsequent action in the public arena. Turning now to participatory aggregation, here the similar behavior undertaken by the occupants of comparable roles is based on similar scenarios that envision achievement of the same collective goals. The role occupants either participate directly in the aggregation by contributing through their own actions to the sum or they do so indirectly by permitting the sum to be claimed on their behalf. Whether the desired effect occurs or not, aggregation ensues because those seeking to mobilize and organize the role occupants are able to call attention to their shared purposes and thereby concert the supporting behavior and give direction to its cumulative impact. The efforts of a government to activate the citizenry for war or of opponents to generate public protests against military action are obvious examples of participatory aggregation. Indeed, many attempts to initiate the processes of participatory aggregation spring from a desire to offset or undo the consequences of unintended aggregation. Advocates of new governmental policies to control rising birth rates, for instance, are seeking to reverse or moderate the course of an unintended aggregative process. While the two types of aggregative processes may thus be interactive as they forge links with macro collectivities, they are nevertheless separable and can usefully be analyzed separately. The distinction between them is the difference between unplanned consequences and calculated organization, between latent and manifest cumulation, between individual and collective action, between diffused and mobilized behavior. There is another distinction between unintended and participatory aggregation worth noting: the former is, so to speak, leaderless, while the latter culminates with spokespersons calling attention to the aggregated behavior. That is, unintended aggregation gives rise to macro parameters that become salient, perhaps even crucial, dimensions of the world scene as they limit or enhance what can be accomplished by those who move around in the global arena seeking to articulate, manage, or resolve issues on its agenda. Because unintended aggregations consist of many diverse and unorganized parts, however, they neither have designated leaders nor positions in which leaders could be placed. To revert again to the example of population explosions, these</page><page sequence="41">JAMES N. ROSENAU 285 'hard realities' of present-day global politics simply exist. They have no leaders who speak for them or who are otherwise authorized to act on their behalf. Virtually by definition, on the other hand, participatory aggregations do have leaders and spokespersons. Whether the role occupants are linked together in organizations (collectivities) or do not share common memberships but are mobilized to act in the same way for a particular purpose (regimes), the resulting structures contain some roles that require their occupants to advance the general organizational goals and/or the specific purposes for which mobilization was initiated. Thus the world scene is pervaded with occupants of positions-leaders who shoulder responsibility for the orientations and activities of participatory aggregations collectivities and/or regimes and who thereby seek to promote or preserve values in the global system. Viewed in this context of spokespersons associated with aggregated outcomes, much of world politics is a contest among leaders of participatory aggregations over the legitimacy of their claims to allocations of the global pie. This is not to imply that participatory aggregations come into being only through the mobilizing activities of their leaders. As previously noted, the interaction of leaders and followers is a two-way process: the participatory aggregation could not form without leaders leading, but neither could it take shape without followers ready to follow. Perhaps these interactive dynamics usually begin with the tireless leader. Yet, on occasion they originate with the restless follower. The sudden, newfound willingness of hundreds of thousands of Chileans to defy the Pinochet regime with protests in May, 1983, is a case in point. Apparently no one anticipated the protests, least of all the man who touched them off: an obscure 28-year-old clerk in the state copper industry, Rodolfo Seguel, who was elected to his first post in the copper union the previous December and became its president in February. One of his first acts was to call for a strike in May. This was eventually watered down to a call for a day of protest, but the intended aggregation brought into being that day was so large as to astonish Seguel along with everyone else. 'I found I had said what everyone was thinking and no one dared to say', he was quoted as observing. 'Suddenly people began to lose their fear' (Hilton, 1983). The distinction between participatory aggregations sustained by collectivities and those that take on the characteristics of regimes lies in whether or not the role scenarios encompass sequences in which the role occupants share commitments to the aggrega- tion's policy-making process as well as to a set of policy goals. If they do involve such commitments and are thus led to accord legitimacy to a particular system, the partici- patory aggregation acquires the organizational structure ofa collective actor an interest group, government, or polity that equips it to cope with a variety of issues and to endure beyond the life of any issue. On the other hand, if the scenarios are confined to a shared commitment to a policy-making process among organizations rather than attaching legitimacy to the same organization, the participatory aggregation lacks the capacity to deal with diverse problems and thus takes on the informal structures of a regime. As for the variability of the sums collectivities can aggregate, the greater or lesser sums result from the extent to which their resources and structures are seen, in the role scenarios held by both their members and those outside, as enabling them to move toward their goals. Consider, on the one hand, those collectivities whose resources are seen as insufficient to the realization of a particular set of goals and/or whose scenarios are seen as not so widely shared as to allow for the coherent mobilization of their role occupants on behalf of those goals. Such aggregations sum to less than their parts. Each member does not contribute enough to allow their leaders to make effective claims on their behalf. Where resources and shared role scenarios support the collectivity's goals</page><page sequence="42">286 A Pre- Theory Revisited and policies, on the other hand, the leadership is able to press, bargain, or otherwise move toward the goals, a set of circumstances in which the collectivity can aggregate a sum seen to be in excess of its parts. Distinctions drawn among aggregative sums, in short, are capability statements derived from the discrepancy between a collectivity's performance and the claims made on its behalf. The statements assess the coherence and potential of collectivities as actors on the global stage, both in general and with respect to particular issues. Examples abound. Political parties in open societies offer clear illustrations of the dynamics of aggregative processes in this regard. A party sums to less than its parts if the support it gets on election day falls short of either its totals in prior elections or of the votes its leaders claimed they could muster. Under these conditions, the influence of the party is diminished by its failure to conform to the prior claims made on its behalf. If, on the other hand, the vote approximates or exceeds the claimed support, then the subsequent activities of the party's leadership represent more than the sum of its parts in the sense that their efforts to press the collective demands of the membership have not been undermined. The retreating or advancing army, the faltering or expanding economy, and the fizzled or unexpectedly large rally are other examples of how collectivities can aggregate sums that are, politically, less or more than their parts. The aforecited case of the Chilean copper union, moreover, suggests that the quicker the alterations in the aggregative sums occur, the more profound will be their effects. It follows that periods of cascading interdependence are marked by a high degree of participatory aggregation and considerable fluctuations in the sums aggregated by collectivities. As the fragmenting of whole systems and the coherence of subsystems cascades across previously stable boundaries, leaders in both systems need to be more active in mobilizing and summing the energies of their members and finding ways to demonstrate that the emergent sums are consistent with their claims. At the height of cascading processes, of course, both the sums and the claims made about them gyrate erratically as the contrariety, simultaneity, and expansivity of tensions and changes flow swiftly within and among systems. The evolution of Solidarity offers a good example in this regard. As its core expanded from a small nucleus of workers in Gdansk, the union became a political force in Poland far more powerful than the size of its formal membership indicated. And as it expanded, the Polish government and Communist Party became increasingly helpless, their fragmentation revealing them to be collectivi- ties considerably less than the sum of their parts. At the same time repercussions were felt or feared in other Eastern European countries, with their governments fearing that the cascades might engulf them and reveal their sums to be fragile and those of their subsystems to be increasing. Then, when martial law was imposed by the Polish government, the direction of the cascades was reversed and the relative sums fluctuated through still another phase of uncertainty and reaggregation. Much the same analysis can be employed to probe the Soviet forces in Afghanistan, the US efforts in Central America, the government of El Salvador, or any other collectivity whose actions stir commotion on the global scene. And it is equally applicable to international systems. Consider, for instance, NATO. Its capacities as a collectivity amount to less than the sum of its parts to the extent that the members differ on military strategy, fall short on their annual contributions, or otherwise work at cross-purposes. The frequent pleas of US leaders to bring NATO's force levels up to prior commitments are, in effect, efforts to make the organization into a whole greater than the sum of its parts, just as is the argument of other members that they not be asked to make commitments beyond their means.</page><page sequence="43">JAMES N. ROSENAU 287 In short, viewed across time and the range of issues comprising a collectivity's political agenda, aggregation and reaggregation are continual processes and the way in which their sums fluctuate, sometimes wildly and sometimes slowly, sometimes exceeding the whole and sometimes falling short of it, depends on how the changing demands and conditions that prevail in the collectivity's internal and external environments impact on the role scenarios underlying the actions of its members. Both the rapidity and the direction of the fluctuations are extremely relevant in an era of cascading interdepen- dence. For, as elaborated below, it is precisely the fluctuations in the essential structures of governments and societies that pose the adaptive challenges to which they must respond and with which they must cope if they are to persist and flourish. Adaptive collectivities are, by definition, those that keep their essential structures within acceptable limits, while those that fail to do so are conceived to be maladaptive and moving toward eventual extinction as a collectivity (Rosenau, 1981: 58). Viewed in this way, the primary challenge to systems is that of keeping cascading processes from exacerbating the sums to which they aggregate beyond acceptable limits. As indicated by the pathos of recent developments in Lebanon, this challenge cannot readily be met if key subsystems begin to narrow or otherwise redefine their criteria of what constitutes acceptable fluctuations in the system's essential structures. Adaptive Collectivities as Actors If aggregative processes depict how and why parts come together to form wholes, adaptive processes account for how and why the parts and the wholes manage to survive amidst other parts and wholes. Both the subsystem parts and the system wholes evolve mechanisms and processes for keeping fluctuations in their essential structures within limits acceptable to their members. By 'essential' structures is meant those patterned forms of interaction that are necessary to a system's continuation, such as its economy, polity, and society. These structures are not impervious to change. They do fluctuate as new circumstances arise, but normally the fluctuations are relatively minimal and thus acceptable to the system's members. Keeping them minimal and acceptable entails the maintenance of some form of balance or, better, a range of balances between the demands that emanate from within the system's internal setting and those that originate external to it. As developed at much greater length elsewhere (Rosenau, 1981), the internal-external balance is conceived to approximate any of four generic types. If the role expectations of a system's or subsystem's policy-makers give higher priority to external than to internal demands, as is the case today in the countries of Eastern Europe, the resulting role scenarios and behavior will amount to acquiescent adaptation. If, on the other hand, internal considerations are predominant in the role scenarios of officials, as has long been true of South Africa, intransigent adaptation is viewed as the basic mode through which the system seeks to keep its essential structures within acceptable limits. Preservative adaptation prevails when both the internal and external demands are experienced as extensive and defined as equally important, a condition which tends to characterize most collectivities that are society-wide in scope. Promotive adaptation persists when a system's or subsystem's role expectations define both the internal and external demands as of minimal significance and thus enable its policy-makers to pursue scenarios derived from their roles in other systems, a condition that is particularly likely to mark the way in which revolutionary movements conduct themselves. To conceive of foreign policies as expressive of one of four forms of adaptive behavior is to take a major step beyond the Pre-Theory. In that original formulation allowance was</page><page sequence="44">288 A Pre- Theory Revisited not made for tensions between a society's internal and external circumstances. Systemic and societal variables were posited as additive and not as competitive (as partials in a total variance and not totals unto themselves), thereby inhibiting the derivation of propositions as to the conditions under which one or the other is likely to predominate. By treating the task of policy-makers as that of maintaining some form of balance between domestic and foreign challenges, however, the concept of adaptation focuses theoretical attention on a crucial dynamic underlying the conduct of a system's relations with the rest of the world. External relations are never undertaken without concern for their internal consequences. Even the most ritualistic and peripheral diplomatic activities are rooted in a concern for sustaining the stability of the international environment so that essential structures at home can freely adhere to their historic patterns. Stated differently, the requirements of politics at home and abroad are bound to be inconsistent with each other-if only because the latter encompasses the conventions and goals of other cultures and how the two are brought into juxtaposition and harmonized must thus be a prime focus of any theory of foreign policy. Indeed, if the scenarios, strategies, and actions of officials are conceived as efforts to keep the fluctuations in a society's essential structures within acceptable limits, foreign policy phenomena are bound to be central foci of empirical political theory. Or at least it is hard to imagine how any theory of any polity, or any class of polities, can be viable without propositions that specify the values, processes, and institutions through which the internal-external balance is maintained. Regardless of the mode of adaptation to which they may be committed, policy-makers normally go to great lengths to avoid a direct confrontation between the internal and external demands that vie for their compliance. Such confrontations compel choices in which either goals abroad or support at home will be set back. They are no-win situations that no regime can afford to endure, and thus considerable effort is expended on either mobilizing domestic support for foreign policies or moderating external commitments so as not to endanger the support base at home. Under some circumstances, however, unavoidable conflicts between internal and external demands do occur. The quintessential example along these lines is the conflict inherent in the choice between guns and butter. Ample supplies of both are not possible in the modern era. As was again revealed when LyndonJohnson undertook to achieve a 'great society' at home and military stability in Vietnam, having both guns and butter gives rise to economic dislocations that even the wealthiest of societies cannot tolerate for long. It is perhaps a measure of the pace of cascading interdependence that direct and unavoidable conflicts between internal and external demands are now surfacing in new arenas far removed from guns-or-butter issues. Recently, for example, both the United States and the Soviet Union were unable to avoid such a conflict. The former was faced with demands from the Third World for increases in its contribution to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that conflicted with demands from within the Congress that IMF loans to poor countries be curbed and the US contribution thereby reduced. Similarly, the Soviet leadership was apparently confronted with a dilemma as to how to placate Western publics over the downing of the Korean airliner without admitting error and responsibility to their own people. The United States sought to resolve its conflict by pressing for new limits on IMF loans as a price for not reducing its contribution and the Soviets sought a resolution of its problem by offering foreign audiences a different explanation of what happened over Sakhalin Island than the one presented at home (Burns, 1983b). Not surprisingly, neither the United States nor the</page><page sequence="45">JAMES N. ROSENAU 289 Soviet resolution worked very well and, at best, amounted to only a temporary amelioration of the underlying problem. The inability of superpowers to keep their essential internal and external structures from clashing points up another compelling reason to treat foreign policy as adaptive behavior: such a perspective offers a means for tracing and explaining why and how national collectivities cope with the continual changes inherent in cascading processes. While the original Pre-Theory stressed that the world was not static and that a viable theory of foreign policy had to allow for the dynamism of change at home and abroad, it provided no basis for theorizing along these lines other than noting that the relative potency of individual, governmental, societal, and systemic variables could undergo alteration. Since it presumes that the core values, processes, and institutions of collectivities fluctuate, the adaptation model readily fills this gap: by positing the possibility that each of the four types of adaptation may give way to each of the other three, it identifies twelve types of transformations any collectivity can undergo and highlights the domestic and foreign conditions that are likely to initiate and sustain each of them (Rosenau, 1981: 80-87). By examining the action scripts embedded in each of the twelve, moreover, the model lends itself to specifying the sequences whereby individuals, both leaders and citizens, get aggregated into larger wholes that either foster or hinder fundamental adaptive transformations. The capacity to trace and account for adaptive transformations takes on additional significance with the end of a prolonged period of worldwide growth and the advent of a global recession in the 1980s. In earlier postwar decades the impetus to adaptive transformations originated largely within most countries in, for example, electoral upheavals, social unrest, and fallen dictators that underlay, respectively, transforma- tions in Greece, Chile, and Spain-while their external circumstances remained relatively stable. In countries such as Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Czechoslovakia, to be sure, military threats from abroad constituted adaptive challenges that could, and did, lead to transformations, but for most countries the relevant international systems were marked by comparative stability. With the onset of the global recession, however, new, unforeseen, and not readily comprehensible challenges emanated from abroad. Enormous deficits in major countries of the Second and Third Worlds rendered them vulnerable to external economic conditions which, transmitted through the IMF and other lenders, conduce to the kind of extraordinary fluctuations in their essential structures that can result in adaptive transformations. It is hardly coincidental, for instance, that in the same narrow time frame the publics of four countries Argentina, Chile, the Philippines, and Poland forced highly authoritarian regimes to acknow- ledge and make adjustments to their demands. Unique circumstances (such as the Falklands War or the Aquino assassination) were at work in each country, but so was it also the case that recession and the necessity of coping with international debts in all four countries edged new middle-class groups over into the ranks of the opposition. In a like manner high unemployment, overcommitted banks, swollen interest rates, and lessened productivity in the First World rendered its countries susceptible to externally induced austerity programs that, in turn, have fostered internal discontent. These dynamics have already surfaced in France, but their operation in one form or another can also be discerned wherever the shocks of the international economy have undermined currencies, thereby initiating adaptive challenges that have greatly quickened the pace of cascading processes. As a retiring official of the OECD put it, 'Adaptation in a high-growth environment is painless', but it is difficult to adjust to 'the cold climate of slow growth'; among other things, she added, slow growth poses the</page><page sequence="46">290 A Pre- Theory Revisited problem of whether publics 'will continue to accept a drastic lowering of expectations, an end to the assumption of economic growth, increasing income, good jobs and better and more forever,' (quoted in Gewirtz [1983]).13 In sum, the concept of adapting collectivities focuses theoretical attention on both the continuities and the breakpoints of international history. The continuities are evident year in and year out as the essential structures of national systems fluctuate within narrow bounds. The breakpoints, those moments when history veers off and change ensues, become salient when the fluctuations turn into gyrations that undermine long-standing role scenarios and cascade new scenarios which reaggregate the sums and the identity of the systems and subsystems competing for scarce resources and public loyalties. 14 Individuals as Actors Since individuals have thus far been treated as products of role expectations who get aggregated into collectivities that sustain the structures of global life through adaptive and cascading processes, it may seem a vast contradiction to return to them as actors and to posit individual variables as prime dynamics in world affairs. Yet I am driven to do so by asking why it is that systems and subsystems of the late twentieth century are so marked by simultaneous coherence and breakdown. The coherence and breakdown underlie the forces of change- the demands of subsystems, the ineffectiveness of governments, the weaknesses of international organizations, the emergence of regimes, and the adaptation of societies but what accounts for their simultaneity? The answer lies partly, as noted, in the quickened pace of communications fostered by the microelectronic revolution. But this is hardly a sufficient explanation. It does not explain why neither coherence nor breakdown have predominated or why they have unfolded simultaneously rather than sequentially. Taken singly or interactively, in short, the dynamics examined thus far fail to account for why crises of authority are so pervasive, for why the chaos of our time seems so orderly, for what it is that infuses structure into cascading interdependence and makes it appear so patterned. To return to individual variables, however, is not to back away from the conception of people as role occupants and their actions as stemming from role scenarios. For the focus here is on generational phenomena, on individual differences across broad historical eras, as distinguished from the actions and interactions induced by the roles that comprise the systems and subsystems of a particular generation. What follows, in other words, explores the ways in which the commotion that marks the global system in the present era may derive from characteristics that people, irrespective of their roles and cultures, share. In so doiSng it does not relax the presumption that role expectations and scenarios shape attitudes, channel personalities, and direct behavior. Nor does it negate the socialization and training whereby roles can enlarge a person's skills. Rather, without compromising the scope and power of role variables, the ensuing analysis identifies two individual variables as operating prior to and independently of the expectations experienced by role occupants. One of the variables, what I shall call the aptitude factor, involves changes in the capacity of people of an era to develop, elaborate, and use action schema as they perform in their diverse roles. The other, what I have labeled the controlfactor, refers to the extent to which people feel that world affairs are controllable, either by themselves or by 'the powers that be'. My overall hypothesis is that in the last decades of the twentieth century, those years in which the post-industrial, high technology age of information</page><page sequence="47">JAMES N. ROSENAU 291 and interdependence began, the aptitudes of individuals for coping with complexity have reached new heights even as their sense of control over the complexity has fallen to new lows. Before indicating why these factors are prime sources of cascading processes, it is useful to note that there is a reason why I have shifted terminology and introduced them as factors and not as variables. It is that I conceive of them as largely constants in the present era even though they have varied considerably in earlier agrarian and industrial eras. As will be seen, they are constants in the sense that both the urban sophisticate and the rural peasant have so greatly improved their aptitudes with role scenarios and so markedly lowered their conceptions of controllability that these factors tend to operate uniformly and not variably across systems today. By 'uniformly' I do not mean that the analytic aptitudes of the rural peasant have caught up with those of the urban sophisticate. The high-tech age of information has not resulted in equal distribution of its skills any more than the industrial era gave rise to an equality in the distribution of wealth. Obviously enormous differences among various population strata still remain. Indeed, the analytically wealthy may even be getting wealthier in their capacity to elaborate action scripts relative to those who have long been poor in this regard. Compared to the one out of three persons who gets a daily newspaper and the one out of 12 who has a TV set in developed countries, for example, the comparable figures for the developing countries are one out of 30 and one out of 500, respectively. Similarly, the same source reports that 83% of the world's books are produced in developed countries and the same figure is used for their proportion of the world's data processing equipment in 1978 (Rada, 1983: 204-205). However, despite these patterns, and as indicated in the ensuing discussion, there are good reasons to presume that the aptitude factor has operated uniformly in the sense of enabling and expanding the analytic skills of those in every societal stratum to the point where their action scripts are neither obscure nor truncated. One way to probe the aptitude factor is to ask what the advent of instantaneous communications and information retrieval of satellites bringing live pictures of world crises and trends into homes everywhere and of computers storing, processing, and disseminating information heretofore unknown and ungatherable may be doing to individuals as potential actors in global dramas? One answer, perhaps a standard answer for hardened students of world history, is rooted in the premise that the person-in-any-street does not change, that he or she continues to be remote from and uninformed about international affairs and thus disinterested in them. Such a perspective sees people as simplistic, as impervious to upgrading, as rabble, or at least as masses that are normally quiescent but that can be easily manipulated and aroused by demagogues under adverse conditions. The daily scenes of screaming and chanting Iranian mobs in the streets of Tehran during the takeover of the American Embassy are quintessentially illustrative for those who perceive publics as uneducated masses and therefore as unaffected by the age of information. Such a perspective strikes me as no longer tenable. A preponderance of the world's people may still be ignorant and apathetic, but that does not mean they have been untouched by the communications revolution. It runs counter to everything we know about social and political dynamics to assert that most people remain unchanged even as global structures are undergoing profound alteration. Indeed, recent research into six developing countries has led to the conclusion that what is lacking in the traditional culture may be provided by the institutions of modern society by the school, the factory, the newspaper, and the radio. These</page><page sequence="48">292 A Pre- Theory Revisited sources of influence evidently have an independent power to effect political socialization, training men to know more about polities, stimulating them to take an interest in political events and to participate in civic affairs, and fostering a shift in allegiance from tribal and local leaders to those representing a wider community of interest (Inkeles, 1983: 256). If this is so, surely the communications revolution is having consequences for people everywhere and not just for educated elites and attentive citizens! Surely traces of this revolution, this information-pervaded age in which we live, are reaching across class and geographic lines and impacting upon the urban poor and underprivileged peasants as well as the busy middle classes! Assertions such as these seem tenable if the age of information is viewed as involving parameter changes comparable in their scope and importance to those initiated by the industrial revolution or the advent of nuclear energy. Such era-altering upheavals affected the skills, orientations, and lives of generations on a global scale even though many people may have been unaware of the causal chains or unable to articulate how the patterns of their lives were altered. Much the same has occurred, I would contend, as a consequence of the parameter shifts brought about by cascading interdependence and the microelectronic revolution. People everywhere are different because the world is no longer the same since the advent of communications satellites and the many other creations of our high-tech age. As I see it, people are different because change at the individual level has involved a transformation in the intellectual, cognitive, and emotional aptitudes through which they develop and use action scripts in their various roles. The realization that social and physical distances have shrunk considerably and made the world much more interdependent, the availability of more information and, most significantly, the increased opportunities to appreciate that information gets packaged in scenarios and that links in complex scenarios get displayed on TV screens around the world have, interactively, so substantially extended the way people comprehend the world as to amount to a transformation in their aptitudes as individual actors. Most conspicuously, people today, whether they live in the First, Second, or Third Worlds, and irrespective of whether their lives are organized around urban or rural routines, employ much more elaborate role scenarios than was the case for their predecessors in earlier eras. I use the word 'elaborate' quite deliberately, having explicitly rejected characterizing their action scripts as ever more 'rational', 'sophisticated', or 'accurate'. The new aptitudes for thinking in scenario rather than static, cross-sectional terms may not lead to sound conclusions or greater sophistication about world affairs. They may even, as Cox (1984) has cogently argued, underlie the recent resurgence of traditional religion on a global scale. For many, these new aptitudes may well be conspiratorial in tone and culminate with scapegoats as villains, but whatever their accuracy, illogic, and level of crudity, the scenarios which delineate the reality world of the mind for adults in the present era are more elaborate. They are marked by longer causal chains, by connections between events, by feedback links, by the perception of action at Time 1 in Place A setting limits and/or opening up opportunities for other actors at Time 2 in Place B. For the same reasons, and no less significant, the processes of aggregation and the consequences of collective action are probably much more central to the individual's scenarios today than was the case for previous generations. Viewed with these hypothesized changes of aptitude in mind, the Iranian mobs raging around the American Embassy in Tehran become a quintessential example of how much more elaborate role scenarios have become with the advent of cascading interdepen-</page><page sequence="49">JAMES N. ROSENAU 293 dence. Or at least the accounts of how the crowds outside the Embassy were galvanized into action whenever the TV cameras were on and pointing in their direction suggests a keen understanding that pictures of outrage and protest relayed around the world would have consequences be links in scenarios that could serve well the reasons for milling around the Embassy. The aptitude factor is also plainly evident in a recent JNfew rork Times/CBS News poll of the American public's attitudes toward the conflicts in Central America that evoked widespread attention because its results seemed so contradictory (Clymer, 1983a). The press and a number of other commentators were perplexed by the poll's uncovering a low level of information about US policies toward the region on the one hand and a high degree of skepticism toward any policies the United States might pursue in it on the other. Such a discrepancy, however, can be readily resolved if the notion of being informed is expanded to encompass the aptitude factor. The various commentators relied on too simple a conception of what it means to be informed, confining their understanding to distinctions among levels of factual knowledge. Viewed in this way, it is indeed confusing that a high level of ignorance should be linked to skepticism rather than disinterest or support. But if the idea of being informed is revised to stress the elaborateness of the role scenarios people employ to react to world events, then the poll data make eminent sense. Most Americans may not have been acquainted with the facts of which factions the United States supports in El Salvador and Nicaragua, but at a higher level of abstraction they were apparently clear in their minds about the action scripts that would follow if the United States extended its involvement in the region. Memories of increased involvement in Vietnam during the 1960s, along with the extended capacity to think analogically and in terms of causal chains the aptitude factor enabled those polled to assert positions on Central America even though they seemed 'uninformed' as that term is conventionally used. Nor have the Russians been immune from the consequences of the microelectronic revolution. Their closed system has not been so impervious as to prevent changes in the competence of the citizenry. Or at least the presence of the aptitude factor was quite noticeable in the extraordinary lengths to which the regime went to place the downing of the Korean airliner in a favorable light. As one observer noted (Burns, 1983a): From childhood, Russians have been taught that they are surrounded by enemies, primarily the United States, and that sacrifices must be made to ward off attack. Yet, in the view of Western diplomats, the plane incident raises troubling possibilities that the leadership cannot ignore. The average Soviet citizen is better educated that he was 20 years ago, and probably more inclined to make critical assessments. In all of this, the diplomats believe, there is a potential difficulty for the authorities as ordinary people assess the incident and ask themselves whether it was handled responsibly. Still another way of glimpsing the aptitude factor at work is by asking why the current period is not marked by trade wars as virulent as those of the 1930s. Certainly the imbalances are conspicuous: with Michigan's automobile industry having been upended by Japanese competition, for example, why have the pressures for higher US trade barriers been largely unsuccessful? The answer is complex, to be sure, and a number of macro factors are surely relevant to an explanation. But some part of the variance lies, I think, in micro changes, in the greater ability of citizens today, compared to their counterparts five decades ago, to handle complex scenarios which stretch</page><page sequence="50">294 A Pre- Theory Revisited beyond a sequence wherein the absence of competitive imports sustains productivity to elaborate sequences in which the political, diplomatic, and military consequences of a highly protectionist world are envisioned. Stated differently, while the trade issue is highly contentious politically and while many citizens and leaders do press for higher tariff barriers, their opposition does not seem so virulent and the issue thus does not seem so contentious as was the case in the 1930s because the opponents, being more able to discern and elaborate alternative scenarios, are constrained in the lengths to which they are prepared to press their case for elevating the restrictions on trade. Of course, examples cannot be cited as proof. Myriad illustrations of the aptitude factor operative throughout the world today could be cited; but, obviously, these cannot be said to affirm the hypothesis that individual aptitudes for developing and using more elaborate role scenarios have expanded significantly in the present era. To be sure, persuasive evidence compiled by Inglehart (1977) indicates that the political skills of Western publics have undergone changes which increasingly enable them to 'intervene in the political process on a qualitatively different level' (p. 367); but these findings focus on modes of participation and only imply a shift in the analytic skills necessary to scenario construction. Systematic data that allow for the comparison of scenario structures across eras have yet to be made, and until they are we can only stress that underlying the examples is a logic that argues for the hypothesis. The logic is rooted in the observation that greater interdependence and faster communications have heightened the salience of aggregative processes and made people more aware of themselves as sequences in elaborate scenarios. While the life of communities has always been founded on the aggregation of individual actions, never before has the transformation of individual behaviors into collective problems seemed so plainly and so poignantly evident. There are a multitude of occasions each day for those in the industrial world to be conscious of themselves as links in causal chains. From the traffic jams in which people get caught to the boycotts they are asked to join, from the water shortages they are asked to alleviate to the tax revolts in which they participate, from the worker rallies in Poland to the urban mobs in Iran they have seen on live television, today's persons-in the-street have had ample first-hand exposure to the links between individual and collective behavior. Similarly, whether it be when they start their automobiles, turn on their air conditioners, or buy their groceries, many are likely to have a fleeting thought that the very act of pressing the accelerator, raising the thermostat, or purchasing bread is part of worldwide processes leading, respectively, to pollution (or clean air), oil shortages (or gluts), or famines (or surpluses). For some people, of course, such scenarios will include multinational corporations or incompetent politicians as weak links in the chains, whereas others will develop action scripts in which their links involve hoarding or cheating on the grounds that elsewhere in the script everyone is doing it. Regardless of how accurately or responsibly the scenarios are utilized, however, the point is that they are elaborate and they invoke familiar experiences for their users. Similarly, in this era when national economies are so clearly and intricately woven into shifts in the global economy thus fostering and aggravating thoughts about scenarios in which the causal chains pose a threat to one's savings, one's job, and one's ability to travel people can hardly be oblivious to the once-remote sequences whereby global currency flows and banking practices culminate in close-at-hand daily routines. Indeed, such sequences, to cite recent cases, press hard upon Venezuelan and French citizens, all of whom were able to move freely and widely around the world only a couple of years ago.</page><page sequence="51">JAMES N. ROSENAU 295 Nor is the heightened consciousness and proliferation of lengthened scenarios confined just to the First World. From Afghan tribesmen to Argentine gauchos, from peasants in India to students in the Philippines, from by-standers in Peru to protesters in Chile, from blacks in South Africa to Palestinians in Lebanon, the interdependence of global life and the consequences of collective action are daily experiences. The action scripts used in the Third World may not be so elaborate as those to be found in the First World, but evidence that neither are they limited or abbreviated can readily be noted. As Dominguez (1981: 201) concluded after a lengthy analysis of extensive systematic evidence: 'Mass publics in less developed countries have . .. been strikingly responsive to changing international events.' More poignantly, consider the anecdotal evidence implicit in this report of an astute journalist who was visited in her Paris office by a poor Iraqi exile: It made me impatient that he persisted in seeking a simple formula, that he was so totally concentrated on the pain and injustice in his own country, so unaware of other peoples' miseries, so confident that if the Americans and the French and others only knew that things were bad in his homeland they would drop everything to fix them. I told him I had no more time. But when he left, I kept thinking about him. He is a person from a long-darkened place who is coming to know what a human being has a right to expect. He can no longer accept the old, dull submission. He had even managed to see that Iraqis were not alone, that their enemies, the Iranians, must be suffering horribly too. His horizons have broadened. There must be quite a lot of people like him by now, emerging through education to question the definition of good and bad handed down by authority, noticing there may be other ways of seeing things, other people with real concerns and grievances. The more I thought, the better I felt about him. He is part of change in the world ... (Lewis, 1984). In short, in the absence of contrary data there are cogent reasons to presume that individuals have not been immune to the world's shrinkage, that through a growing capacity for elaborating role scenarios they are linked ever more securely into the processes of world politics, that they are keenly aware of these links, and that both their capacities and their awareness is in turn central to the dynamics of cascading interdependence. But how do these new aptitudes of individuals get translated into actions that initiate and sustain cascading processes? My argument is that they do so by combining with the control factor to encourage a preference for those scenarios in which certain collectivities, those that are closest in time, space, and function, seem particularly likely to serve a persons's needs and wants. And once people discriminate among scenarios in terms of salient subsystems that are especially effective, coherence and breakdown cascading processes are bound to follow. Turning to the control factor, again the evidence is more suggestive than clear-cut, but it is sufficient to hypothesize that change is at work, that a global trend is unfolding whereby people increasingly feel, both individually and collectively, that they have lost control over the course of events. On the one hand, there are such anecdotal indicators as the anguish of the peace movement over the prospects of nuclear holocaust and the apathy of American students over US actions in Grenada, Lebanon, and Central America. A sense of powerlessness has been cited as the explanation for the difference between these tepid reactions on the campuses in the 1980s and the vigorous student protests in the late 1960s and early 1970s against US actions in Vietnam. 'People care', a</page><page sequence="52">296 A Pre- Theory Revisited student at Iowa State University reportedly said, 'but wonder what's the point when there's nothing they can do'. More importantly, supporting the anecdotal indicators are systematic findings developed by social psychologists and sociologists. The former have compiled consider- able data on what they call 'locus of control' (Lefcourt, 1980; Weisz and Stipek, 1982), in which 'the perception of control' is viewed as 'a process, the exercise of an expectancy regarding causation' (Lefcourt, 1976: 53). Unfortunately, however, all their findings pertain to the sources of varying responses to close-at-hand situations and not to distant events in large systems believed to be beyond control. Similarly, sociologists have long worked on such concepts as alienation (Seeman, 1983), powerlessness (Tilly, 1978), norm emergence (Turner and Killian, 1972), and a host of other phenomena that bear some, though not immediate, relevance to the concept of the control factor developed here. Commonplace, for example, is the inclination among sociologists to enumerate the negative consequences of growing social, economic, and political complexity for the sense of control people have over their lives. Central to their formulations is the premise that modern man is and feels increasingly remote from the centers of decision in society. Such a feeling had even been noted among members of the Trilateral Commission. An account of the Commission's 10th Anniversary Conference noted that a mood of despair marked the deliberations: What comes through most clearly in these ostensibly inner circles of power is how little capacity these people feel they have to shape events. Far from flexing muscles to manipulate hidden levers of control . . they are groping almost desperately for ways to bring back some order. If there is any conspiracy, it seems to be in the diffusion of power, of impersonal if not inhuman forces eluding and confusing the attempt to plan (Lewis, 1983: 31). If the elite of the Western world are racked by such feelings, surely the same can be said of those whose resources and influence are virtually nil. Perhaps the most persuasive indication that a worldwide sense of lost control marks our time is provided by the rampant subgroupism that has surfaced on a global scale in recent years. Doubtless some part of the subgroup explosion has derived from emulative processes, from a communications technology which enables groups in one part of the world to observe and imitate the activities of counterparts elsewhere. But presumably the proliferation and expansion of subgroups stems from more than the rapid diffusion of examples. There must, after all, be reasons to emulate others. There must be similar but unrelated circumstances at work throughout the world that underlie its emulative processes and account for the concurrent sense and recognition of shared identity among the members of diverse and innumerable subgroups in every corner of the globe. It is here, in the questions posed by the presumed pervasiveness of autonomous and spontaneous sources of rampant subgroupism, that traces of the control factor can be delineated: Why have the waning years of the twentieth century witnessed an explosion of authority crises and of intense group feelings on every continent and in all of their communities? Why are people everywhere turning their backs on the whole system the state, the society, the community and turning to less encompassing collectivities? Surely a major part of the answer is that, having acquired a growing capacity to elaborate scenarios in which whole-system complexity results in their isolation, people everywhere have lost confidence in the whole systems as being too complex to meet their needs and serve their wants. And so they have turned to subsystems, to the less remote and less complex groups with which they somehow feel linked, in the hope that their</page><page sequence="53">JAMES N. ROSENAU 297 interests can be better served and a modicum of control thereby exercised over the distant and impersonal forces which intrude upon daily routines. The resurgence of the family and the church, not to mention the emergence of long-dormant linguistic, nationality, and ethnic groups, can be seen as exemplifying responses to the complexity that has removed people from controlling their own destinies. Some might argue that people have been increasingly removed from the centers of decision ever since the onset of the industrial revolution nearly two centuries ago and that, accordingly, once again it is a misguided form of ahistoricism to treat the control factor as a recent development. This reasoning overlooks the interaction of the control and aptitude factors. While it is surely the case that the processes which progressively separate people from decisional centers have been intensifying since the eighteenth century, only in our time has this long-term trend taken off and reached the point wherein people have given up on the distant centers and turned to those more close at hand. Stated metaphorically, the long-term trend was a gentle slope that rose incrementally in the direction of skepticism and doubt; but the short-term pattern of the past few decades traces a steep climb in which the sense of lost control has mounted exponentially. Why? Because the newly acquired capacity to elaborate lengthy scenarios has enabled people to discern more clearly the complexity and number of links in the causal chains that distance them from the whole systems and to recognize that the possibility of their breaking into and refashioning the chains has declined to near zero. An estimate of'near zero' seems more accurate than simply 'zero' because the symbols of whole systems their flags, heroes, and historic monuments still serve as sources of confidence and hope for some citizens, thereby inhibiting a perfect inverse correlation between the aptitude and control factors. In the coming decades, however, as time passes and extends the aptitude factor, the sense of lost control may sink to zero as the whole-system symbols seem increasingly vacuous.15 I do not mean to imply that all systems and subsystems have been pulled into zero-sum relationships as the world has become more complex. Obviously there are a number of non-zero-sum situations wherein systems and subsystems interact harmoniously, reinforcing each other's structures and sharing the burdens and opportunities inherent in common challenges. To repeat, however, the central tendency would appear to be in the direction of cascading interdependence. It is difficult to foresee a diminution in the dynamics of the high-tech era that have intensified the aptitude and control factors. The tension between these factors seems bound to extend and deepen the global crisis of authority as people everywhere become more skilled at locating themselves in an ever-more complex world, at grasping the extraordinary dilemmas the complexity poses for them, at seeing through the authorities who claim they have answers and can resolve the dilemmas, at recognizing the ineffectiveness of governments, at acknowledging a readiness to shift their loyalties and undergo reaggregation, and at identifying close-at-hand subgroups which seem to offer greater hope of satisfying their needs and wants. Yet, it is the very nature of cascading processes that their paths into the future are not linear and unwavering. One can readily imagine circumstances in which the very dynamics that make for pessimism over the short run foster tendencies deserving of optimism in the long run. That is, even as intensified conflict lies in the immediate future because people will be inclined to fall back increasingly on their near-at-hand subgroups as their growing analytic capacities and a declining sense of control undermine their confidence in the ability of whole systems to ameliorate and resolve their problems, so might the very same capacities lead them subsequently to ever more elaborate scenarios</page><page sequence="54">298 A Pre- Theory Revisited which, in turn, will generate a recognition that increased subgroup conflict also does not serve their needs. At that point, hesitantly and reluctantly, but sustained by their still enlarging capacities for analysis, they will begin to appreciate that compromises struck within the whole system may be preferable to treating subsystem values as paramount and non-negotiable. Forerunners of this dynamic can be seen in the crisis-inspired schemes designed to prevent the collapse of the international banking system, in the growing trend toward labor union votes accepting reduced or eliminated wage increases, and in the continual bargaining between church and state authorities in Poland. In any event, whatever course the emerging global system may follow, the expanded talents and action scripts of publics are likely to serve as the building blocks on which the aggregation and adaptation of collectivities will be founded and sustained in the future. If so, if the analytic aptitudes of individuals have become increasingly worldly, henceforth the tasks of theory must proceed from the premise that our time is marked by cascading processes, by dynamics of change that spread across systems and subsystems with such rapidity and power as to fuse once separate processes of coherence and breakdown into seamless webs. Observers as Actors It remains to stress again that we are not immune to the swirls of change that cascade across the global system. We are students of the system, but we are also part of it and thus our work is, in subtle and erratic ways, interactive with it. I use the word 'interactive' deliberately. It suggests not only that our conduct as scholars may be responsive to the course of events (as noted at the outset), but also that what we do as observers may have an effect on the conduct of world affairs. For our analytic aptitudes have also undergone enlargement, sensitizing us ever more acutely to the alternative scenarios inherent in the rigidities and frailties of collectivities. Thus we too can be torn apart by the tensions between our own subgroup ties and our links to whole systems, with the result that our experiencing of these tensions seems bound to underlie our teaching, research, and the many other ways in which we interact with the world. The Pre-Theory was not totally oblivious to these interactions. It did highlight ourselves as recipients in them by stressing that science is a value-explicit and not a value-free enterprise and that, accordingly, students of world politics need to be more self-consciously adept at the tasks of explication if a cumulative, consensual, and reliable body of knowledge is to evolve in the field. To a large extent, in fact, the Pre-Theory was no more than an attempt to illustrate how inchoate thought about the external behavior of different types of national societies can be brought into consciousness, how all of us carry around presuppositions about foreign policy of which we may be unaware and, regardless of the depth at which they may be buried in our subconscious, how these implicit understandings, assessments, and concepts could and should be explicated if theory development is to occur. But the hindsight of 20 years suggests my argument for explication was too limited. It focused on self-consciousness as necessary to the process whereby theories are assessed and findings evaluated. In so doing it neglected the ways in which awareness of ourselves in relation to our subject matter is crucial to the quality and direction of our research and the ways in which our critical theories shape and sustain the processes of cascading change. To stress value explicitness, in other words, is to imply too simple a process, as if one need only search one's soul and rummage through one's conceptual storehouse to</page><page sequence="55">JAMES N. ROSENAU 299 insure analytic rigor. Such sensitivities do, indeed, continue to be crucial to cumulative and high-quality inquiries, but the dynamics of global change today-especially the heightened salience and claims of subgroups and the lessened effectiveness and frayed authority of whole systems point up the need to extend our sensitivities to what is happening to us as scholars, as definers of global reality, as individuals seeking to move forward professionally and personally. We can no longer assume-as the original Pre-Theory did that we are static observers, that our values and concepts remain constant throughout our careers, that our personal lives evolve independently of our professional successes and difficulties, and that explication consists merely of being clear about these constancies. Instead, we need to treat ourselves as open systems, as actors undergoing continuous development and change in response to the very changes in the world we are seeking to grasp and influence (Dannefer, 1984). Most conspicuously perhaps, we need to recognize that our professional and personal worlds may be intimately and inextricably connected and that any disturbances in the one can have repercussions for the other. We need to acknowledge that our links to international affairs are not exclusively cognitive. They may also be shaped by considerable affect, with the result that how we feel about the world may impact significantly upon how we frame and conduct our inquiries into it. In effect, we are subject to developing an affective as well as a cognitive stake in the course of events, an affective stake that can be as influential in our theorizing as the cognitive premises that guide us. No less important than the recipient side of our interactions with the world is the output side, those ways in which we may influence the course of events through our work as analysts and advocates. Such influences, or the lack of them, can also be a source of confusion and disillusion. The world has never been very attentive to our advocacy or responsive to our actions, and thus we are often confronted with the temptation to forgo scholarly detachment for policy involvement. And yielding to the temptation is easily rationalized: the great problems of war, justice, and poverty are of such overriding importance that often it seems compelling, if not reasonable, to devote ourselves to them as activists and thereby to risk exceeding our training and competence as we champion worthy solutions. Then, swept along by the intrinsic rightness of our actions, we easily mistake the vigor of our advocacy for the rigor of our analysis. This is not to argue for isloation in an ivory tower. By scholarly detachment I do not mean we should avoid entering the public arena. My thought is rather that we remain truly scholarly when we are in that arena. How? By adhering to a strict rule-of-thumb which specifies that our conduct in the public arena be no different than our conduct in the classroom, the library, or the computer center. Thus, for example, one brings to the op-ed page, the legislative hearing, and the television talk-show all the qualifications and cautious interpretations that are the hallmark of our work in the various settings on campus or in the columns of our journals. Thus, too, one avoids the temptation to participate in situations involving brief advertisements, stormy rallies, or any other format that does not allow for breaking problems down into their component parts, delineating alternative explanations of them, or the many other cautious practices to which one is habituated in the classroom, the library, and the computer center. And there are good reasons to quell the activist temptations and cling to the rule-of-thumb that confines us to the detachment of our analytic talents. One is that we are not very good at advocacy. It is not our medium. Either our sense of urgency makes us sound shrill or our sense of ourselves makes us sound pedantic, with the result that we are easily dismissed as either self-serving or irrelevant. Shorn of our professional</page><page sequence="56">300 A Pre- Theory Revisited skills our commitment to careful interpretation, to multi-variate explanations, to testing the null hypothesis we lose our distinctiveness and few are inclined to listen. A second reason is that we undermine our reputation as analysts the more we do battle in the public arena. Why should anyone listen if we sound no different from all the others who self-interestedly clamor for public support? A third is that once we abandon the analytic rule-of-thumb and enter the arena on its terms, we may have difficulty withdrawing from it. That is, we may undermine our capacities as analysts by becoming so engaged in worthy causes as to lose touch with the very skills that set us apart in the first place. It is hard, for example, to accept the null hypothesis if one cares too much. Fourth, a good case can be made for the idea that every society needs analysts who are sufficiently detached to critically assess where it is going. If ours was exclusively a community of advocates, who would provide the feedback that is so vital to the health of viable collectivities? But there is an even more important reason to limit our interactions with the world to conduct befitting the classroom, the library, and the computer center. It is that we may have a far greater influence upon global affairs in our role as analysts than we do when we become activists and advocates. Our influence in this regard is not easily traced, and oft-times it moves along circuitous routes, but it is surely operative. How? Our work as scholars helps define-through our students who subsequently enter leadership roles, through our empirical findings that eventually get translated into premises for journalists, through our interpretive essays on which politicians and other advocates may build their belief systems the sociopolitical reality around which public affairs are organized. Put more specifically, a subtle process is always at work whereby the way in which publics and officials identify issues, define situations, contrast action scripts, recognize cascading processes, comprehend how collectivities cohere and adapt, and otherwise give structure to the course of events is in some measure a consequence of how we conduct our inquiries. In sum, as advocates we can be readily dismissed, but as builders and disseminators of knowledge our efforts become entries in the channels of communication that shape and sustain the fabric of global life. As observers, then, inevitably we are also actors, and that thought should be both a sobering and exhilarating source of renewal as we move the International Studies Association beyond its first quarter-century.

Of course, viewed from the perspective of policy-makers who may occupy a number of roles in private systems as well as the many built into their official positions, the scenarios are even more elaborate and complex, approaching mammoth proportions as the criss-crossing patterns also trace the personal conflicts and consequences that may follow from emersion in the action schema of their public roles. For a stimulating discussion of the tensions between private and public role scenarios, see Sennett (1977). 9. Given the potential of the microelectronic revolution for storing, proliferating, and analyzing interactive files of information, other things may not remain equal for very long insofar as the construction of role scenarios is concerned. 10.

It is also points up why revolutions occur so rarely: given the complexity of social processes, the chances of simultaneous convergence occurring around new scenarios are extremely small and yet, as Crozier and Friedberg have noted (1980: 223-224), profound collective changes only unfold when all the actors learn the new scenario together. 12.

Viewed in terms of a lessening hold that whole-system symbols exercise over an increasingly analytical citizenry, the long and progressive tendency toward cheating on taxes and the long and progressive decline of voter turnout in the US become further indicators of the aptitude and control factors. For in this context the widening underground economy to which tax cheating gives rise is not so much a consequence of amoral, anomic behavior as it is of efforts to retain control over the key, close-at-hand links through which people are tied to the whole system. Similarly, the lower turnouts become not so much a reflection of apathy as they are of analytic skill and the reduced inclination to vote to which the skill leads. As the report on a recent survey of voter attitudes put it, 'Low voter turnout in the United States is unlikely to be changed much by simplifying voting and registration procedures, extending voting hours or instituting Sunday or holiday voting ... The poll of 2,530 adults ... showed that the problem was not procedure but motivation, especially a low level of belief that voting makes a difference' (Clymer, 1983b). References ABELSON, R. P.
