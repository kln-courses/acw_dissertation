<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Figure for Cibola: Art, Politics, and Aesthetics among the Luluwa People of the Democratic Republic of the Congo CONSTANTINE PETRIDIS Postdoctoral Fellow, Fund for Scientific Research-Flanders, Ghent University, Belgium APARAGON of female beauty, the maternity figure at The Metropolitan Museum of Art exemplifies a well-known sculpture type of the Luluwa people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Figures 1, 2). Luluwa figures that depict a pregnant woman or a mother and her child are gen- erally related to the cult of Bwanga bwa Cibola, the goals of which are to prevent infertility and infant mortality and to foster the reincarnation of a deceased ances- tor.' The Metropolitan Museum's figure offers an opportunity to explore Luluwa notions of fertility and aesthetics, and to investigate the formal and stylistic variety of the Luluwa's figurative carvings in the con- text of their history and sociopolitical organization. A few years ago, I contributed an essay on a very sim- ilar Luluwa maternity figure at the Art Institute of Chicago.2 On the basis of the complementary research that I have conducted since, the present article offers some additional data and new interpretations. After a brief introduction to the Luluwa and the core con- cepts of their traditional religion, I will analyze the Bwanga bwa Cibola cult and compare it with a posses- sion ritual of the neighboring Mongo. In passing, I will also shed some light on a cult called Bwanga bwa Bwimpe. I will then focus attention on the striking body decorations that grace both male and female figures and discuss the different regional substyles that characterize Luluwa figurative sculpture. In con- clusion, I will address the so-called hemp cult, popu- larized in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, and the iconoclasm it allegedly entailed.3 THE LULUWA PEOPLE The Luluwa, or Beena Luluwa, live in a vast region between the Lubudi and Kasai Rivers in West Kasai Province in the southern central part of the Democra- tic Republic of the Congo (formerly the Republic of ? The Metropolitan Museum of Art 2001 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM JOURNAL 36 The notes for this article begin on page 253. Zaire; Figure 3).4 Together with the Luntu, the Konji, and the Luba-Lubilanji, the Luluwa, who comprise a number of subgroups, form what might be termed the Luba-Kasai cluster. These peoples all speak Chiluba dialects and share many cultural traits, and they all trace their origins to Nsanga a Lubangu, a mythical place said to be located in Katanga Province in south- eastern Congo. There are also many overlappings in these peoples' social and political organization, econ- omy, and religion. The general consensus is that Luba emigrants from Katanga Province settled in their present-day environment in successive waves between the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. They assim- ilated with the local population of their new habitat, which consisted of peoples identified as Bindji (or Bindi) and Kete and different pygmoid groups. Although hunting is still considered a prestigious activity by the male population, today the Luluwa are mainly farmers. They have always been active traders, but it was especially their involvement in the long- distance trade at the end of the nineteenth century that had a profound impact on their culture. About 1875 Chokwe traders from Angola immi- grated to Luluwa country; some of them founded vil- lages amid the Luluwa, the traces of which can still be seen today. The traders introduced the Luluwa to products previously unknown in the region and left their mark on the local culture. Body decoration, architecture, and masking are among the aspects of material culture that clearly show Chokwe influence. Elsewhere, I have discussed the diffusion of the Chokwe boys' mukanda puberty ritual and associated masks among a number of Luluwa subgroups.5 Chokwe immigrants also inspired the Luluwa's politi- cal organization and social structure. Kalamba Mukenge, of the Luluwa Bakwa Katawa subgroup, and other power-hungry Luluwa chiefs became close allies of the Chokwe chiefs who led the northward migra- tions. These Luluwa chiefs emulated the Chokwe's more centralized state formation, overruled neighbor- ing Luluwa chiefs, and gradually created a social divide between chiefs and commoners.

The Luluwa and neighboring peoples in West Kasai Province in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (map: Charles Meur and Marc Felix, Brussels) see, this class distinction also had an effect on the Luluwa's artistic production in that a number of ritual objects evolved into symbols of status. The Luluwa and their Luba neighbors believe that both the spiritual and the physical world are perme- ated with a life-force (mooyo). The ritual specialist (mpaka manga or mupaki wa manga) evokes the life- force's powers by using charms (manga; sing. bwanga). The term bwanga refers to an object that serves as a container or support of power substances or ingredi- ents (bishimba). It also refers to the cult associated with this object and the rituals that define the cult. If the container has the shape of an anthropomorphic fig- ure, it may be regarded as a "real" power figure, in which case the term lupingu (plural, mpingu), a generic name for man-made figures, is also applicable.6 The above-mentioned ingredients assure the effi- cacy of both manga and mpingu. They are composed of mineral, plant, animal, and human substances and act as mediators or conductors. The ritual specialist deter- mines the composition of the ingredients and the way they are to be introduced into the container. The power of both the manga and the ingredients is sus- tained by recharging the mixture at regular intervals, particularly with the appearance of the new moon. The most powerful substance used to effect this recharging or revitalization is kaolin (lupemba). Manga are diverse in both form and function. Although a distinction is sometimes made between positive and negative manga, all may be used both to heal and to harm. There is also a distinction between "large" (or collective) and "small" (or individual) manga. They can be of a permanent nature and have a lasting power or be used periodically and have merely a temporary effect. The manipulation of these charms resembles the worship of ancestors in that charms incite the ancestral spirits (bakishi, bashangi, or ban- kambwa).7 People placate and make sacrifices to the ancestral spirits in exchange for their help and pro- tection. Some forms of ancestor worship involve the explicit manipulation of charms. B W4NGA B W4 CIBOLA The Bwanga bwa Cibola fertility cult and the accompa- nying charms are popular among the Luluwa and their Luntu, Konji, and Luba neighbors.8 There are many regional and even local differences regarding certain details of the cult. Sometimes, it is called Mbombo instead of Cibola. Several of the Luluwa's numerous manga are concerned with issues of fertility and the protection of pregnant women, newborns, and small children. The Cibola cult deals specifically 237 3 &lt; a ..A NK!_ S -IL "- .. c w,</page><page sequence="4">with women who have had a succession of miscar- riages or whose newborn children have died shortly after birth. The cult must ensure a successful outcome of the pregnancy and a safe delivery and see to it that the child grows up without problems. Its ultimate goal, however, is to provoke the reincarnation of a deceased ancestor in the newborn child. Like other manga, Bwanga bwa Cibola in many ways relates to the veneration of so-called spirit-trees, trees that are believed to inhabit or shelter spirits and are the focus of prayers and offerings.9 Indeed, as in the Cibola cult, a tree altar called Mulopo is addressed when a woman's children die after birth. The Mulopo also promotes the reincarnation of the deceased child's spirit in a newborn infant. A female and a male spirit-tree, respectively called mumbu and kasam- bankusu, are planted to ensure that the ancestors of both lineages watch over the pregnancy and the deliv- ery. A small conical clay mound is erected between them. The whole is consecrated with a mixture of palm wine, rainwater, and water from a pond. This mixture is kept in a bowl, which is later placed on the mound. Another spirit-tree, the kapulwayi (Jatropha curcas), fulfills a function similar to that of the Mulopo and Bwanga bwa Cibola. This spirit-tree is planted when a woman suffers from sterility or experiences difficul- ties during pregnancy, or when a child dies after birth. As a rule, initiation into the Cibola cult follows upon consultation with a diviner. This religious specialist is called in by the unfortunate woman or by her relatives when traditional medical treatments with plant and other vegetal extracts are not effective. Initiation into the Cibola cult is the sole effective remedy to the woman's problem. Many potential causes are taken into consideration. Most often, sorcery is thought to be the determining factor in calamities and bad fortune. Sometimes, the diviner will reveal that the woman is the victim of a fickle ancestral spirit or a malevolent manga maker. Occasionally, it is believed that the woman is possessed by a metaphysical force identified as cibola. However, this kind of possession is often perceived as the result of the transgression of certain behavioral rules and norms. Thus, women who have had premarital sexual relationships are especially vulnerable. Possession by the cibola leads to a relationship of reciprocity and mutual dependence. The relationship of the patient to the cibola force is one of ambivalence, ambiguity, and reversibility. Those who do not respect the imposed rules and prohibitions run the risk of being severely punished. Bwanga bwa Cibola is there- fore sometimes characterized as a double-edged sword (mwele wa nkanza). As I have noted elsewhere, Bwanga bwa Cibola is clearly related to other healing 238 and fertility cults shared by various Bantu-speaking peoples in central and southern Africa.'? At least in some respects, the initiation process into Bwanga bwa Cibola resembles a possession ritual called Zebola, Jebola, or Yebola, which is widespread among the peoples of the Mongo complex living north of the Luluwa.l Zebola-note the homophony with Cibola- is a female healing ritual for either purely physical or mental health problems thought to be caused by ancestral spirits that are also called Zebola. Through divination the spirit inhabits the woman's body and thus reveals the source of the disease. The ensuing healing ritual entails taking various kinds of medicine and learning the Zebola songs and dances. As we shall see, as in Cibola, emphasis is placed on the beautifica- tion of the patient's body. Unlike Cibola, however, Zebola has a communal and public character, and choreogra- phy and music play a much more important role. Zebola also addresses a much wider range of problems. After having determined the cause of the woman's misfortune, the Luluwa diviner will direct her to a mupaki wa manga (ritual specialist). A mupaki wa manga who specializes in Bwanga bwa Cibola is often a woman. It is the mupaki who organizes the initiation into the cult and determines the proscriptions to be respected by the woman. Although the initiation process as such allows for many variations and often reflects the personal preferences of the ritual special- ist, it always follows the same basic pattern and consists of a number of essential phases. The prohibitions, which are shared by the ritual specialist, concern both the woman's diet and her behavior. Thus, certain game animals are forbidden to her, and sometimes her food is even restricted to the consumption of manioc porridge. Most often she will be secluded in a special fenced-in house at the edge of the village. The initia- tion always involves the learning of ritual cult songs, a confession of past sins or crimes, and the sacrifice of chickens. Although intense sexual activity at the beginning of a new pregnancy is believed to stimulate the fetus's growth, a mother-to-be will soon have to abstain completely from sexual intercourse. In the past, the mother had to wait until the child born after her initiation into the Cibola cult had reached the age of three before she was allowed to resume intimate relations with her husband. After the birth of the child, the diviner will be asked to identify which deceased ancestor is reincarnated in the newborn. In order to do so, he-or she-will look carefully for possible congenital signs or handicaps (misangu; sing. musangu). 2 The identity of the ances- tor will later become clearly evident through the child's way of walking and manner of speaking. The first child, boy or girl, born after a successful initiation</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4.

Unknown photogra- pher. Frobenius-Institut an derJohann Wolfgang Goethe- Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, L1/2360 (photo: Frobenius- Institut) into the cult is always named Tshibola. Usually, when she-or he-is three months old, the child will be officially presented to the community in a solemn coming-out ceremony called dyala, scheduled to take place during the new moon. Prior to the dyala cere- mony the child may only be approached by other ini- tiates into the Cibola cult. As a way of giving thanks to the ancestors, a meal is shared by the ritual specialist and the families of both spouses, and a plantain tree-for a boy-or a banana tree-for a girl-is planted near the parents' house in the village. The mother and her child will continue to live apart from the village until the child starts to walk. During this postnatal seclusion period, the newborn infant, like its mother, must regularly be rubbed with a mix- ture of red clay and palm oil. At the rising of each new moon the mother must sing ritual songs in her baby's honor and sacrifice a chicken for her manga. Blood of the chicken is poured over her manga, and her Cibola figure is "fed" a piece of chicken liver or some manioc porridge. At the end of the seclusion period, the ritual specialist will shave the heads of both mother and child, neither of whose hair has been cut since the child was born, and lift the ban on the mother's sexual activity. In exchange for her or his services, the happy couple will present the mupaki with money or goods. A final communal meal signals the end of the ritual cycle. Like the birth of other "special children," gen- erally called mapanga, that of a Cibola child is always accompanied by a public closing ceremony (Figure 4). Mothers of such children will continue to perform ceremonial dances on market days, Sundays, and other holidays.'3 The parents of such a child usually remain cult members until their fifth child is born, after which they are allowed to lead Cibola initiations themselves. POWER OBJECTS AND SYMBOLS OF STATUS Bwanga bwa Cibola does not often involve the use of carved figurative manga. Instead, as is the case in many other cults, horns, snail shells, leather or cloth bags, pouches, or bundles serve as containers for ingredients. Some of the cult accessories are depicted on related figurative Bwanga bwa Cibola sculptures, at least on those carved in a naturalistic style. The figure at the Metropolitan Museum bears on its back the carved imitation of a snail shell stuffed with all kinds of ingre- dients (Figure 2). A snail shell (nyonga; Achatina mar- ginata swains) is the central object of the Bwanga bwa Cibawu, one of the most popular types of bwanga.14 Bwanga bwa Cibawu is a general term that encom- passes different important manga with multiple func- tions, combining defensive and offensive powers. It is the most important collective protection of both the community (ditunga) and the family's yard (lubanza) and is therefore sometimes called Bwanga bwa Ditunga or Bwanga bwa Lubanza. Its main function is to offer protection against sorcerers in general and so-called lightning senders in particular.'5 Because several pri- mary sources have explicitly linked the cult with prob- lems of infant mortality, there is a direct relationship between the Bwanga bwa Cibola and the Bwanga bwa Cibawu. 239</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5.

The white mostly derives from kaolin (lupemba) and has essentially positive con- notations. The red is obtained either from camwood powder (kakula) or from red clay-earth (mpisha, cilaabu, kamuma, or budinda). This color signals the punish- ment, even the destruction, of sorcerers.'6 The Figure 6. Two wrapped snail shells attached to a twig frame- work (Bwanga bwa Cibawu).

The few known figurative Cibawu objects usually also combine this partition of the body surface in two opposing col- ors with a Janus face or multiple heads on a single body.'7 Two singular objects at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, which were collected by Frederick Starr, a professor of anthropology at the University of Chicago from 1892 to 1923, in the mixed area around Lwebo in 1906, are rare examples of Cibawu snail shells (Figures 5, 6). Another type of object, identified as a Bwanga bwa Lubanza or Bwanga bwa Ditunga, of which Starr also collected examples, consists of a ring made of fibers and twigs into which a number of schematically carved half-figures are inserted (Figure 7). Contrary to the cleaned and polished surface of many Luluwa figures in Western collections, the origi- nal powderlike red surface of the figure in the Metro- politan Museum is almost intact and closely resembles the way people beautified their bodies in various ritu- als and ceremonies. Indeed, the figure's appearance is strikingly similar to that of the conservative elders who opposed the reforms of chief Kalamba Mukenge, described in early travel accounts (see below, p. 248). It is clothed in a small loincloth that imitates those made of red-dyed fiber or banana leaves that constituted a Luluwa woman's only covering. Like the Metropoli- tan's figure, Luluwa women also typically wore a metal ring or a bamboo stick through the septum. Although 240 -'- -.~--' I7. ~ ~ _t~ ~ -L.~I?-</page><page sequence="7">Figure 8.

The example depicted here wears a three-lobed coiffure (makata) that resembles the wigs made of vegetable fibers and human hair and adorned with cowrie shells (mibela; Cypraea moneta) that were woven into the hair (Figure 8). This type of headdress was also smeared with palm oil, red camwood powder, and clay. The central pointed extension on the skull depicts a headdress called dis- unga or disungu.i8 The attention devoted to the con- struction of the hair also recalls the aesthetics of the above-mentioned Mongo Zebola possession rituals. Usually, a woman receives a number of protective manga from the ritual specialist, including one or more carved figures and other cult accessories, when she enters seclusion. According to some sources, the figurative carvings are given to the mother-to-be in the course of the eighth month of pregnancy. This month, generally called cizaba, constitutes a crucial time in the woman's initiation process. At this time, the many pro- Figure 9. Half-figure of a woman holding a child (Bwanga bwa Cibola).

The cizaba month is, accordingly, sometimes also referred to as "the month of the manga." The term ciz- aba also refers to a clay container, filled with water and various other ingredients, that the future mother receives from the ritual specialist. Placed at the entrance of her house and, later, near the newborn, this object is meant to offer protection against evil forces. The woman will wash herself daily with the ciz- aba's contents and drink them regularly to stimulate the growth of the unborn child and ensure a safe delivery. In times past, it seems that a woman always received two figures. Albert Maesen reported that, traditionally, 241</page><page sequence="8">Figure o. Half-figure (Bwanga bwa Cibola). Luluwa, Democratic Republic of the Congo, lgth-2oth century. Wood; H. 35-7 cm. Ex coll. Henri Pareyn, Antwerp. Etnografisch Museum, Antwerp, 1920, AE 758 (photo: Etnografisch Museum) she would receive the same number of figures as the number of children she had lost.19 The figures were sometimes identical, but more often one was a replica of the other in miniature. The larger figure was kept at home; the smaller replica was carried around. The maternity figure at the Art Institute of Chicago is per- haps the only standing full-figure with a short wooden peg under the feet that has been preserved. It thus relates formally to some pointed-base half-figures holding a child (Figure 9). However, I have found that at least one other mother-and-child figure at the Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren, shows the remains of a similar peglike extension.20 This formal characteristic indicates how these carvings were actu- ally used. Both types of Cibola figures seem to have been kept in a corner of the house in a clay pot or a basket filled with dirt and several ingredients, into which the pointed base was inserted. The face of the figure was oriented toward the door in order to prevent evildoers and negative forces from entering the house. As mentioned earlier, true-to-life and elaborately detailed statues like the one at the Metropolitan Museum are rare. The majority of Luluwa carvings, Figure 11. Half-figure.

Luluwa figurative sculpture can thus be classified according to two styles, one realistic, or even naturalis- tic, the other schematic, or even abstract. This classifi- cation would point specifically to the sociopolitical context of the second half of the nineteenth century. Naturalistic images are as much symbols of status as ritual objects. They are related to the development in some parts of Luluwa territory of a class distinction that reached its culmination in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. This development is strongly reminiscent of the evolution from "process art" to "statement art" that Alien Roberts has described with regard to the Tabwa people of Lake Tanganyika in eastern Congo.21 An understanding of the distinction between the two may be useful to our discussion of the schematic and the naturalistic styles of Luluwa art. Like ritual, process art is "transformatory" and meant to provoke change or to solve problems connected with change. Statement art, on the other hand, is "confirmatory" and con- 242</page><page sequence="9">cerned with the celebration of authority and the safe- guarding of an existing order. Among the Luluwa, the contact with Chokwe tradesmen from Angola and the influence of the slave trade gradually led to the formation of a small elite of noblemen. Some Luluwa chiefs tried to imitate the more centralized political organization of the Chokwe. They attempted to overrule neighboring lesser chiefs, a goal they achieved at least in part thanks to the accumulation of imported Chokwe firearms. Not every Luluwa chief benefited from the newly developed long-distance trade. And because exploration of the region was not extensive, only a few chiefs appear in the travel accounts written by German explorers at the end of the nineteenth cen- tury. Among the best-known headmen are Mfwamba, Tshinkenke, and Kalamba Mukenge, all of them reigning in the central Luluwa region. The sociopolitical evolution must have occurred concurrently with the development of workshops under the direction of master sculptors. It seems obvi- ous that refined sculptures, such as the one at the Metropolitan Museum, were produced by profes- sional carvers in a workshop environment, whereas rudimentary carvings in the schematic style are the work of ritual specialists or even their clients.22 Fig- ures in the naturalistic style are thus not only less com- mon than those in the schematic style; they are also more recent, since they are the result of the above- mentioned class distinction. A case in point is that some of the oldest Western collections, such as that in the Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren, hold many more Luluwa carvings in the schematic style than in the naturalistic style. Also, some schematically carved figures at the American Museum of Natural History, New York, which Starr collected as "Baluba" around Lwebo in 1906, may in fact originate from the Luluwa, whom Starr, like many other early travelers, considered to be a subgroup of the Luba (Figure 1).23 Female figures in the naturalistic style were proba- bly the exclusive property of an elite group of women in positions of authority. Along with the stratification of Luluwa society sketched above, women close to powerful male leaders possibly also gained sociopoliti- cal prominence. Traditionally, a polygynous man's first wife already held control over the other women of her husband's harem in domestic matters, and chiefs turned to their sisters, mothers, and/or wives for political council. When several villages are collec- tively struck by repeated misfortune or adversity, the chiefs call in the help of elderly women and widows to perform the Lwendu Iwa Mucipu ritual as a last resource. At night, these women, wearing only a small Figure 12. Female figure holding a cup and a !N. rC' pounder (Bwanga bwa Bwimpe). Luluwa, ? .

In imitation of the Chokwe example, the advisory role of the female population in public matters must have acquired a new dimension with the emergence of a nobility at the end of the nineteenth century. It is very likely that small rudimentary figures were meant for private use and could be owned by any woman, whereas refined and elaborately carved larger statues in the possession of a select group of wealthy and powerful women were put to the service of the whole community.24 BWIMPE, OR THE MORAL BASIS OF BEAUTY Although their appearance testifies to the fact that naturalistic female Cibola figures portray high-ranking women with ritual and political authority, the figures' iconography also reflects the initiation process dis- cussed above. Ultimately, maternity figures and repre- sentations of pregnant women are meant to glorify and celebrate fertility and motherhood. It is here that 243</page><page sequence="10">Figure 13.

Wilson Fund, 1982, 82.49 (photo: Detroit Institute of Arts) the Luluwa's notions of aesthetics and ethics come into play. Beauty, especially female beauty, is at the core of both the Cibola cult and the naturalistic carv- ings it relies on. The term bwimpe, sometimes replaced by bulenga, is generally used by the Luluwa and their Chiluba-speaking neighbors to denote beauty, which refers to both physical and moral beauty and thus combines the Western terms "beautiful" and "good." Indeed, physical beauty is a sign of moral integrity. Moreover, emphasis is placed on cultural, or "human," beauty-that is, beauty created by human hands. This union of aesthetics and ethics also lies at the basis of the production and use of yet another cate- gory of female carvings. Female figures holding a little cup filled with white chalk in one hand, a fine example of which can be found in the Metropolitan Museum's collection (Figure 12), are generally related to a cult called Bwanga bwa Bwimpe. Accordingly, the figures themselves are called Lupingu Iwa Bwimpe, Bwanga bwa Bwimpe, or simply Bulenga, although the latter name seems to be proper to the neighboring Luba- Lubilanji, who would have imported their sculptures from the Luluwa. The Detroit Institute of Arts has an example of a special subcategory of Bwimpe figures measuring some forty centimeters in height and carry- ing a cup in one hand and a walking cane or stick in the other (Figure 13).25 The Bwimpe cult was meant first and foremost to safeguard and foster the fertility of a young mother and the beauty and health of a newborn. It was specifically concerned with the well- being of those mothers who had given birth to a child with a pale skin, called mwana mukunse (literally, "red child"). Such a child was deemed exceptionally beau- tiful by the Luluwa and required special protection against sorcerers and envious people. Usually, the birth of a pale-skinned child was also accompanied by the planting of a white-barked spirit-tree called mwabi (Sterculia quinqueloba) next to the mother's house (Figure 14). The ideal combination of morality and physical beauty, as expressed by the Chiluba terms bwimpe and bulenga, is widespread in sub-Saharan Africa.26 Among the Luluwa, it is clearly reflected in the style and iconography of the naturalistic Cibola carvings. It is also evident from the time and attention the Luluwa accord to skin care and skin beautification. As men- tioned before, the face and body of a woman under- going initiation into Bwanga bwa Cibola are covered with a mixture of palm oil and red clay, sometimes also red camwood powder and white kaolin. The same treatment will be applied to her Cibola figure and, later, to her newborn child. Similar concerns of beauty were the basis of the intricate scarification marks on the face and body of both women and carved female 244</page><page sequence="11">Figure 14. A mwabi tree (Sterulia quinqueloba) in the village of Kamembele, 1996. Luluwa, Democratic Republic of the Congo. (photo: Constantine Petridis) figures. In the past, a woman's body had to be per- fected and "humanized" through the application of geometric and curvilinear scarifications, true "marks of civilization," in order to be fully appreciated.27 Among the Luluwa, cicatrizations are generally known as nsalu, a term also applied to decorations in relief on carved objects, such as drums and drinking horns. It seems that the Luluwa practiced two types of cicatrization, one characterized by raised designs in low relief, the other by graphic color patterns that are closer to tattoos in the strict sense of the word. Some- times the term ndundu-referring to the rubber smeared into cuts to cause black lines in the skin, which tend to fade with the passage of time-is used for the latter types; but it is also used to refer to facial scars as opposed to body marks. It is very likely that the two types of scars were used in different parts of Luluwaland, but, as we shall see, like headdresses and other body decoration, scarifications also changed over time.28 According to the Luluwa, children with a spotless and healthy skin run the least risk of falling victim to sorcery, while children with skin disorders and physi- cal handicaps are seen as potential sorcerers. Of course, the value accorded to the smoothness of the skin can only be applied to the unscarified body of small children. It is significant in this regard that the above-mentioned Bwanga bwa Bwimpe also dealt specifically with the beauty and health of newborns and infants. Research by Albert Maesen indicates that, as signs of bwimpe or bulenga and as emanations of the ideal combination of physical beauty and moral virtue, scarification marks and other skin treatments were also thought of as the best protection against sor- cery.29 This is one of the reasons that some of the finest Cibola figures, like the one at the Metropolitan, are distinguished by such a careful and naturalistic rendering of these body marks and other physical signs of beauty. As power objects and mediators between the ances- tral spirits and men, designed to protect against mis- fortune and adversity, the ultimate function of Cibola 245</page><page sequence="12">Figure 15.

Other anatomical details also serve to obstruct sorcery. The Luluwa and neighboring Chiluba-speaking peoples in Kasai Province, for exam- ple, attribute special meaning to the anterior and pos- terior fontanels. Like the bichromy of the Cibawu discussed above, these body parts signify "double sight"-that is, clairvoyance and the ability to discern the invisible in the visible and the past and future in the present.30 Often, as is the case with the Metropoli- tan Museum's figure, the fontanels are visually marked in Luluwa figurative sculpture by means of a pointed hairstyle and usually harbor one or more cav- ities that are filled with magical substances. In addition to the realistic depiction of scarification 246 Figure 16. Scarifications on a woman's body, 1913-14. Bokala, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Postcard published by Ern. Thill, Brussels, after a photograph byJoseph Maes. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, Photograph Study Collection designs, beauty was also expressed in the Luluwa figures' long necks, large heads, and high foreheads. A woman's strong calves were highly esteemed by men, since they indicate her capacity for hard labor in the fields and in the domestic environment. The same positive aesthetic values were expressed by elaborate coiffures and jewelry. Wealthy women wore several blue-and-white-beaded necklaces in parallel rows, as represented in relief in the Metropolitan Museum's figure. Another important sign of beauty and perfec- tion was the naturalistic imitation of an umbilical her- nia, at once a symbol of the close relationship between the ancestors and their descendants and of the succes- sion of the generations. The idealized beauty embodied by female carvings was also meant to invite ancestral spirits to inhabit affl Mti^ft r . I I</page><page sequence="13">Figure 17. Female figure (Bwanga bwa Cibola).

In this regard, Lucien Stephan speaks of an "esth6tique des esprits" in relation to these art forms, which have the realm of the spirits as their main audi- ence and addressee.31 Judging from extensive research by Mary Nooter Roberts, a similar motivation seems to lie at the heart of the representation of beau- tiful women in the ritual art of the Luba of Katanga Province.32 Like carved female figures, Luluwa women themselves are seen as mediators between the natural world of humans and the supernatural world of the spirits. As among the Luba-Katanga, many Luluwa diviners and ritual healers are indeed women. It is at this point that the parallels with the Mongo Zebola initiation become especially apparent. Upon an initial divination session, during which the woman goes into a trance, the Zebola healer transforms the Figure 18. Maternity figure (Bwanga bwa Cibola).

With the aim to please and seduce the spirit, her body will be cared for and embellished day after day. Anoint- ment with a red paste signals the bond between the woman and the spirit and advertises her special posi- tion. The beautiful dances for the zebola spirits, which demand great flexibility, serve the same purpose of spirit seduction. According to Ellen Corin, "the work done on the body during initiation may be inter- preted as reshaping several corporal and sensory envelopes and as participating in the recreation of a sense of self; its reconstructive value should be enhanced by its symbolic reference to loving and pro- tective spirits who are the real recipients of what is done to the body."33 In fact, judging from field pho- tographs, the coiffure, makeup, clothes, and other 247</page><page sequence="14">attributes of the Mongo Zebola initiate are strikingly similar to those of a woman undergoing initiation into the Cibola cult among the Luluwa. LULUWA SCARIFICATION AND FIGURATIVE SCULPTURE IN REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE Scarification, both on people and on figurative carv- ings in wood, shows a large variety of techniques, forms, and designs. Today, the practice of scarifying one's body is almost extinct. Elderly women occasion- ally bear traces of small, geometric blackened scars on their face, chest, or abdomen. But in general, these have little in common with the complex curvilinear motifs depicted on naturalistic Luluwa figures such as the Metropolitan's sculpture. Available sources, how- ever, reveal that scarification practices were linked to local fashion trends and foreign influences and have never been equally distributed throughout the vast Luluwa region. Leo Frobenius, for example, writing about his visit in 1905, mentioned that some sub- groups in the western part of Luluwa territory adopted scarification patterns from their Chokwe neighbors.34 As we shall see, certain internal religious reformation movements also had an influence on scarification practices. Historical field photographs of Luluwa people are scarce, and pictures showing men or women whose bodies are graced with scarification patterns are even more rare. One of the most notable exceptions is a photograph from the 188os showing a man whose elaborately scarified body seems to indicate that he belonged to the conservative elders who opposed the religious reforms of chief Kalamba Mukenge and his followers (Figure 15). However, the scarified bodies of the male and female carvings in the naturalistic Luluwa style also show some similarity with those of people belonging to the Mongo complex in early field photographs (Figure 16).35 The parallels are clear in the curvilinear motifs, with a predominance of con- centric circles, but also in the fact that Mongo scarifications are usually raised in high relief. Thus, in addition to the affinity between the Luluwa Cibola and the Nkundo and other Mongo peoples' Zebola, there also seems to be a relationship between the two cul- tures in terms of their characteristic scarifications.36 With the exception of a group of female figures col- lected in the 193os by the colonial official and med- ical doctorJules-Auguste "Tiarko" Fourche among the Bakwa Ndoolo subgroup near the southern town of Dibaya (Figure 17), naturalistic Luluwa figures appear mainly to have been collected and probably also pro- duced in the northern area of Luluwa territory, close Figure 19.

Museum fur Volkerkunde, Hamburg, 5858:06 (after drawing by Hans Martin Lemme, courtesy Museum fur Volkerkunde) to the lands inhabited by the peoples of the Kuba con- federation. In fact, the naturalistic style encompasses a number of regional substyles, some of which have been identified with particular northern Luluwa sub- groups. Along with a number of stylistically related figures at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, and the Royal Museum for Central Africa, Tervuren, the figure at the Metropolitan Museum can be attributed to the Bakwa Mushilu subgroup of the area around the town of Ndemba (Figure 18).37 Frobenius's data, however, indicate that naturalistic and schematic figures existed side by side in the same village among the same subgroup at the same time. Indeed, as shown in the accompanying illustrations, he collected stylistically distinct carvings among the 248</page><page sequence="15">Figure 20. Half-figurine.

The fact that Frobenius collected far more figures in the schematic style than in the natu- ralistic style also reinforces the idea that the origin of the naturalistic style is related to the stratification of Luluwa society in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Frobenius also collected many refined figures in the naturalistic Luluwa style among neighbors of the Luluwa, such as the Northern Kete and Bakwa Mputu (Beena N'Putu) (Figures 22-27) and the Ngeende (Bangende), Pyaang (Pianga), and Byeeng (Bienge Ndumbi).39 In this respect, attention should be drawn to the fact that, according to Jan Vansina, small figurines on a pointed end, called nnoon, were possi- bly introduced along with charms among the Pyaang by the neighboring Luluwa.40 Moreover, the Kuba term for "statue," iping, is borrowed from the Luluwa or the Kete, who, as we have seen, use the word lupingu. It is also significant that some northern Luluwa subgroups share the Kuba's belief in nature spirits, which are unknown in the southern Luluwa region. Among these northern Luluwa they are referred to as mingici, a term that clearly derives from the Kuba word (mi)ngesh.41 The above-mentioned peoples-Northern Kete, (Bakwa) Mputu, Ngeende, Pyaang, and Byeeng-seem to have acted as mediators between the Luluwa and the Kuba. At the end of the nineteenth century, there existed numerous trade contacts between the Luluwa and the Luba in the south and the Kuba in the north. The Mongo peoples do not typically carve anthropo- morphic figures, but the Ndengesh, who are generally viewed as "Kubaized" Mongo, have produced a special type of human statue that is intricately covered with imitations of Mongo-like scarification marks. As such, they show a stylistic kinship with certain Luluwa carvings.42 At the beginning of the twentieth century, both the Luluwa and the Luba also intermingled with the Kuba in the area around Lwebo.43 Frans Olbrechts, who applied Giovanni Morelli's method of morphological analysis to the figure sculpture of Congo, believed that Luluwa art was related to the so-called court art of the neighboring Kuba.44 And in fact certain scarification designs on Luluwa figurative carvings can also be seen on the remarkable drinking cups in buffalo horn or their wooden replicas that occur among several peoples in southern Congo but are mainly preserved under the name "Kuba" in Western collections (Figure 28).45 Contrary to what Olbrechts seems to suggest, however, it is the Luluwa and the Kete who influenced Kuba art 249</page><page sequence="16">Figure 22.

Indeed, freestand- ing anthropomorphic Kuba figures in wood are very rare and practically limited to the famous ndop king statues.46 In the end, the naturalistic Luluwa style con- stitutes an autonomous entity and shows little if any relationship to the sculptural production of the Kuba and their neighbors. THE HEMP CULT AND THE ALLEGED END OF LULUWA ART In the literature, the decline of figurative sculpture among the Luluwa has often been linked to chief Kalamba Mukenge's propagation of a new bwanga known as the "hemp cult."47 As a new bwanga, this cult, or religion, was initially aimed at establishing peace, happiness, and friendship. The followers of Kalamba Mukenge's new hemp religion, the beena dyamba or "people of the hemp," also expected their new bwanga to bring them longevity and even immor- tality.48 At the end of the nineteenth century, the explorer Hermann von Wissmann reported how Ka- 1r I 250</page><page sequence="17">Figure 25. Female figure holding a cup (Bwanga bwa Bwimpe). Bakwa Mputu, Democ- ratic Republic of the Congo, mid to late gth century. Wood; H. 32.2 cm. Field-collected by Leo Frobenius in 1905. Museum ffir Volk- erkunde, Hamburg, 5284:07 (after drawing by Hans Martin Lemme, courtesy Museum fiur Volkerkunde) lamba Mukenge seized power figures from subjected chiefs and destroyed them publicly in a bonfire.49 Wissmann believed that figures covered with scarification patterns were produced by past genera- tions as a result of the ban issued by Kalamba Mukenge on their application. At the time of the explorer's visit to the area, the younger generation had indeed abandoned elaborate marks in favor of simpler motifs, and the beena dyamba had copied the forehead scarification marks of the Imbangala.50 As mentioned above, the scarification of body and face has always been strongly influenced by fashion and foreign influences. Frobenius points out that while certain southern Luluwa subgroups showed the influence of Chokwe scarifications, northern Luluwa subgroups such as the Bakwa Mputu continued to Figure 26. Half-figure.

Although Kalamba Mukenge's privileged relation- ship with European travelers and explorers gave him wealth and prestige, as well as preeminence over his rivals, his power was limited both geographically and historically, and his religious reform did not affect the entire Luluwa region. Apparently, Kalamba Mukenge's influence did not reach the northern areas of Luluwa country, north of Ndemba, where most of the naturalistic figures seem to have been produced. Nor do the primary sources indicate that his hemp cult actually led to the massive destruction of figura- tive manga. One should not overlook the fact that basically Luluwa art had an ephemeral status and Luluwa practitioners did not as a rule preserve their cult accessories. They were supposed to relinquish and sometimes even destroy their manga statuettes and other cult objects after they retired from the cult-in the case of the Bwanga bwa Cibola, after the birth of their fifth child.52 Perhaps connotations of prestige and status associated with figures in the naturalistic style prevented them from being abandoned or destroyed by their owners, but many figures were 252 Figure 29.

Kalamba Mukenge's reform, one of many religious renewals, may have entailed the prohibition of exist- ing beliefs and practices, including the use of manga, in a limited part of Luluwa territory, but it surely never affected the entire Luluwa region. Moreover, the carv- ing of schematic, rudimentary figures as manga has been kept alive up to this day, at least in some villages. It therefore seems more likely that the end of the nat- uralistic figure style is related to the abolishment of the new stratification of Luluwa society by the colonial powers in the beginning of the twentieth century.

In passing, I would like to draw attention to the many erroneous data provided in the German edition of a catalogue that was recently published in conjunction with a traveling exhibition organized by the RMCA; see Boris Wastiau, cat. nos. 62-68, in Afrikanische Kunst: Verborgene Schdtze aus dem Museum Tervuren, Gustaaf Verswijver et al., eds., exh. cat., Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Dusseldorf (Munich: Prestel; Tervuren: RMCA, 1999), pp. 166-69. The term makishiis common among the Luvale and related peoples of Zambia but is not used among the Luluwa (p. 167); bakulu merely points to seniority and elder- ship but cannot be used to refer to the ancestors or ancestral spirits (p. 167); bijinga is clearly a misspelling of the term bishimba and certainly not a synonym for bwanga (p. 168); there is no field-based proof that wood of the Hymenocardia acida is fre- quently used in connection with Luluwa fertility rituals and medicines (p. 169), and so forth. 4. Rik Ceyssens (personal communication, February i, 1998) informed me that Luluwa people are also among the Congolese minorities who immigrated to northeastern Angola. It seems that some of these Luluwa immigrants in Angola are called Beena Maayi, or "People of the Water"; see Jose Redinha, Os Bena-Mai da Lunda (Luanda: Fundo de Turismo e Publicidade, 1974). However, according to Ceyssens, the pseudo-ethnonym Beena Maayi is very common in the Kasai region, and the Luluwa themselves use it to denote all their western neighbors. 5. Petridis, "Luluwa Masks," African Arts 32, no. 3 (1998), pp. 32-47, 91-94; see also Frobenius, "Bena Lulua," LF 3, pp. 5, 26. Rik Ceyssens (personal communication, September 30, 2000), however, points out that aside from the Chokwe many other influences must be taken into account in order to explain the diversity of Luluwa culture. These various influences have also given shape to Luluwa sociopolitical organization. Thus, it should not be overlooked that several central Luluwa sub- groups, such as the Beena Kashiya, Bashila Kasanga, and Bakwa Mwanza, immigrated from the east. Some 18th-century sources also attest that contacts with other than Chokwe peoples living west of the Luluwa's present habitat are much older than schol- ars generally assume. Moreover, Chokwe immigration occurred sporadically rather than in one monolithic movement. 6. Hermann von Wissmann recorded the terms bwanga, bishimba, and lupingu in the 1 88os; Wissmann, Unter deutscher Flagge quer durch Afrika von West nach Ost von 1880 bis 1883 (Berlin: Globus, 1889), p. 1o6; and Wissmann et al., Im Innern Afrikas, facing pp. 258, 265. According toJules-Auguste "Tiarko" Fourche and Henri Morlighem, both makers and users of manga had an agreement with the ancestral spirits who lie at the basis of the powers of manga and their ingredients (Communications, p. 61). Leo Stappers rightfully questions the translation of the term bwanga as "fetish" because of its emphasis on aspects of form rather than content; Stappers, "Priires luba-kasaayi datant de 1912," Cahiers des Religions Africaines 3, no. 5 (1969), p. 114. In referring to the Bwanga bwa Cibola as a "cult," it should be emphasized that this translation cannot be equated with the narrow Christian meaning of the term derived from the Latin verb colere (see also note 47). 7. The ancestral spirits are ranked in a hierarchy and are seen as ambassadors of the Supreme Being Mfidi Mukulu, who is first addressed in prayers to the ancestors; seeJules-Auguste Fourche and Henri Morlighem, "Conceptions des indigenes du Kasai sur l'homme et la mort," Journal de la Societe des africanistes 7, no. 2 (1937), pp- 197-98; and David A. McLean, "The Sons of Muntu: An Ethnological Study of the Bena Lulua Tribe in South Central Congo," M.A. thesis, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, 1962, pp. 156-58. Frobenius-who noted that the southern Luluwa subgroups also called their wooden figures bashangi-thought that the term mukishi was prevalent among the Luba-Lubilanji but that the neighboring Luluwa preferred the term mushangi instead ("Bena Lulua," LF 3, p. 23). 8. According to Albert Maesen (Umbangu, pl. 27), an art historian who did some fieldwork among these peoples in 1954-55 dur- ing a collecting expedition in southern Congo for the RMCA, the Songye also knew this particular cult. However, other researchers have not been able to confirm this. 9.

Among the Mongo-Ekonda, the Zebola healing ritual is known as Njondo; see Daniel Vangroenweghe, "Njondo: Therapie voor geestes- zieken door muziek en dans bij de Ekondastam," in De Mongo: Bewoners van hetEvenaarswoud in Zaire, exh. cat., Stadszalen, Sint- Niklaas (Brussels: Gemeentekrediet van Belgie, 1984), pp. 49- 50. Considering the other affinities with Mongo culture, which are discussed later in this article, it seems reasonable to assume that possession by the Cibola force as a condition for initiation into the Cibola cult was especially prevalent in the northern part of Luluwa territory. For some general information on Mongo culture, see also Gustaaf Hulstaert, Les Mongo: Apercu general, Archives d'Ethnographie 5 (Tervuren: RMCA, 1961); and Luc de Heusch, "La Beaute est ailleurs: Pour en finir avec les masques tetela.

Often, children who are born with a physical handicap are 254</page><page sequence="21">also considered special and are called mapanga. The birth of such children is usually accompanied by the planting of a mumbu tree; see also Samain, "Geestenbomen," p. 222; Henri Bogaerts, "Onomasticon van 't Luntuvolk," Congo 2, no. 2 (1937), pp. 176-81; and Muteba Nzambi Mushipula, "'Mukiya', 'Tshibau' et 'Tshibindi': Sanction sociale et morale chez les Luba du Kasai," Zaire-Aftique 27 (1987), pp. 277-79. 13 See also McLean, "The Sons of Muntu," pp. xxviii-xxxii; Faik- Nzuji, "Les Differentes categories," p. 562; and Diambila Luboya, "La Sage-femme et le couple mere-enfant chez les Beena Luluwa," Journal de la Societe des africanistes 60, no. 2 (1990), p. 164.

In "Of Mothers and Sorcerers" (p. 189, fig. 6), I published a photograph showing mothers dancing in honor of a son born after three girls or a daughter born after three boys, which Amaat Burssens, a professor of African languages and lin- guistics at Ghent University from 1926 to 1967, made during fieldwork among the Luluwa in 1937. 14. See also Fourche and Morlighem, Communications, pp. 59-60; and Maesen, "Statuaire et culte," pp. 51-52. Frobenius already mentioned that a tschiboa is made for protection against sorcer- ers ("Baluba," LF 4, p. 59).

The Cibawu often is kept by a woman whose initiation into the cult is characterized by a possession-trance. These women usually become powerful divin- ers who specialize in the pursuit of lightning senders and sorcerers. 16.

Bichromy is also typical of carved posts that are found among many peoples in Central Africa; see Petridis, "Tree Altars," pp. 138-44. It is not a coincidence that the face of the famous male figure at the Berlin Ethnologisches Museum is also divided into a red and a black half; see Petridis, no. 147, in Afrika, pp. 223-24. 18.

The description Hermann von Wiss- mann (in Wissmann et al., Im Innern Afrikas, p. 209) gives of the bimpulumba, conservative elders who objected to Kalamba Mukenge's religious reforms, closely resembles the appearance of figures in the naturalistic style, including the beads and cowries woven into the hair; see also Frobenius, "Bena Lulua," LF 3, pp. 13-14; and L. Lietard, "Etude sommaire sur la tribu des Lulua (Kasai, Congo belge)," Bulletin de la Societe Royale Belge de Geographie 53, 1 (1929), p. 40. 19. Maesen, "Statuaire et culte," p. 56. 20. See Petridis, cat. no. 111i, in Treasures, pp. 331-33. Most Luluwa figures in the naturalistic style seem to have been carved from mutoci wood (Crossopterix febrifuga); see also Roger Dechamps, "L'Identification anatomique des bois utilises pour les sculp- tures en Afrique. II: La Sculpture des 'Luluwa,"' Africa-Tervuren 17, no. 3 (1971), pp. 79-86. It is noteworthy that such figures are generally in much better condition than pieces made from other kinds of wood. 21. Allen F. Roberts, "Social and Historical Contexts of Tabwa Art," in The Rising of a New Moon: A Century of Tabwa Art, Roberts and Evan M. Maurer, eds., exh. cat., University of Michigan Museum of Art, Ann Arbor (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1985), pp. 10-16, 23. However, contrary to what Annie Vandewiele-Lannoo, a student in art history at Ghent University in the early 1940s, suggested, there is no evidence to identify naturalistic figures as protective charms, on the one hand, and schematically carved pieces as "fetishes," on the other; Vandewiele-Lannoo, "De plastiek der Bena-Lulua," licentiaatsver- handeling (M.A. thesis), Rijksuniversiteit te Gent, 1945-46, pp. 12, 36. For general information on the Luluwa's involve- ment in the long-distance trade, see esp. Ntambwe Luadia- Luadia, "Les Luluwa et le commerce luso-africain (1870- 1895)," Etudes d'Histoire africaine 6 (1974), pp. 55-104. 22. This distinction between large and carefully carved figures 255</page><page sequence="22">made by professional master sculptors for the benefit of the whole community versus small and often rough-hewn figures made by the ritual specialist or the client himself for private pur- poses, has also been recorded among the neighboring Songye, whose mankishi figures are very similar to the mpingu of the Luluwa and who also use the terms bwanga and bishimba; see Dunja Hersak, Songye Masks and Figure Sculpture (London: Ethnographica, 1986), pp. 118-22; see also Fourche and Morlighem, Communications, pp. 57-60. 23. It is notable, however, that a small elite was able to develop a carving tradition of such a high degree of refinement in a rela- tively short time span. Unlike the case of the Tabwa of south- eastern Congo, there is no indication whatsoever that the Luluwa imported their elite arts from one of their neighbors, nor that they relied on sculptors of foreign origin or that local sculptors imitated the work of others. Curiously enough, in the available sources there is also no mention in relation to the above-cited famous central Luluwa chiefs of their role as patrons of a state art or of the existence of a real court with a dis- tinguished class of professional sculptors. 24. On the Lwendu Iwa Mucipu ritual, see also Badibanga Kant- shiama and Tshishimbi Katumumonyi, "Le R6le de la femme dans la soci&amp;et luluwa," Les Cahiers du CEREKA i, no. 1 (1988), pp. 93-94. Rik Ceyssens (personal communication, February i, 1998) questions the social stratification of Luluwa society. Rather, he views the brief and local equation of the power of men and women at the end of the 19th century as resulting from the immigration of traders on traditional matrimonial exchanges. Furthermore, he confirms that some nouveaux riches benefited from the long-distance trade and indeed aggrandized their political status but suggests that the interest of the new bourgeoisie in baubles of foreign origin rather con- tributed to the degradation of "classical" Luluwa sculpture; see also Ceyssens, Balungu: Constructeurs et destructeurs de I'tat en Afrique centrale (Paris: L'Harmattan, 1998), pp. 58 n. 54, 155-57. 25. These carvings not only attest to the political power certain women held by the end of the 9th century; they also shed light on a form of spirit-possession not entirely dissimilar to the one that sometimes leads to initiation into the Bwanga bwa Cibola. When the eldest daughter of an important chief fell ill and reg- ular treatment brought no relief, a diviner would determine that the woman was being possessed by an illness-inflicting spirit. Initiation into a special cult would free her from posses- sion and lead to her recovery, after which she received the hon- orary title of inabanza and was invested with the highest political power. See Samain, "Geestenbomen," pp. 223-25; and Marcel Lecomte, "Le Rituel de feminisation des sorciers dans la magie de l'accablement lulua et basonge," typescript, n.d., Archives of Jean Willy Mestach, Brussels. 26. Many African languages have a single word that means both beautiful and good. Among the Lega the term busoga is close to the classical Greek concept of kalokagathia: it denotes the insep- arable combination of goodness and beauty that is the ultimate goal of initiation into the Bwami association; see Daniel Biebuyck, Lega Culture: Art, Initiation, and Moral Philosophy among a Central African People (Berkeley: Regents of the University of California, 1973), p. 129; and idem, La Sculpture des Lega, trans. Brunhilde Biebuyck and Mihaela Bacou, exh. cat. (Paris: Galerie Helene et Philippe Leloup, 1994), p. 32.

(NewYork: Center for African Art, 1986), pp. xiii- xiv; and Wilfried Van Damme, A Comparative Analysis Concerning Beauty and Ugliness in Sub-Saharan Africa, Africana Gandensia 4 (Ghent: Rijksuniversiteit, 1987), pp. 11-19, 53-57. 27. The expression is borrowed from Susan Mullin Vogel, "Baule Scarification: The Mark of Civilization," in Marks of Civilization: Artistic Transformations of the Human Body, Arnold Rubin, ed. (Los Angeles: Museum of Cultural History, University of Califor- nia, 1988), pp. 97-105. The same ideas of body perfection and humanization through scarification are also reflected in the figure sculpture of the Luba-Katanga; see Mary Nooter Roberts and Allen F. Roberts, "Body Memory," in Memory: Luba Art and the Making of History, Roberts and Roberts, eds., exh. cat. (New York: Museum for African Art and Prestel, 1996), p. 98. Rubin, who rightfully remarks that even cicatrizations tend to flatten and are thus not really permanent, draws attention to the fact that the dark pigmentation of many sub-Saharan African peoples lends itself better to the sculptural quality of cicatrizations than to the graphic quality of tattoos; Rubin, "General Introduction," in Marks of Civilization, pp. 13 and 15. 28. See also Wissmann et al., Im Innern Afrikas, p. 167; Denolf, Aan de rand, pp. 121-23; and Albert Maesen, field notebook no. 54 [1955], RMCA, Ethnography Section, pp. 11-12. The term ndundu is also used for a specific scarification motif; see Leo Stappers, "'Arbeidsvitaminen' der Bena Luluwa-vrouwen," Africa-Tervuren 1o, no. 4 (1964), p. 98, n. 30; and Tshisanda, "Le Theme de la maternite," p. 60. 29. Maesen, "Statuaire et culte," pp. 53-54. It seems very likely, however, that, as in the case of the Mongo Zebola healing ritual, scarifications were also applied for medical purposes in the con- text of the Bwanga bwa Cibola initiation; see also Diambila, "La Sage-femme," pp. 165, 169. 30. When the anterior fontanel (kapoba or kabankoshi) of a newborn is sunken, the mother will smear a mixture of red camwood powder, palm oil, and other ingredients on the fontanel in order to prevent the baby's life-force from escaping through it; see Kathryn W. Nelson, "Child Rearing Patterns in a Lulua Vil- lage of South Central Congo," Ph.D. diss., University of Michi- gan, Ann Arbor, 1968, p. 258. On the symbolic significance of the posterior and anterior fontanels and their relationship to the navel, see also Fourche and Morlighem, Communications, pp. 62-63; Marcel Lecomte, "Le Theme de l'esoterisme lulua," JeuneAfrique lo, no. 26 (1957), pp. 10-12; Clementine M.

See Roberts and Roberts, "Body Memory," pp. 111-12. As among the Luba-Katanga, Luluwa scarifications also had erotic connotations and were meant to heighten a woman's appeal; see also Van Caeneghem, letter of September 13, 1938; and Tshisanda, "Le Theme de la maternite," p. 75. Thus, a lozenge motif on the breasts is called tunkinda, meaning "little rat traps," referring to the female genitals which seek to "devour" the male organ, metaphorically called cya mutu bu mpuku, "having the head of a rat"; see Clementine M. Faik-Nzuji, "L'Art plastique africain comme extension de l'art corporel," in De l'art negre d 256</page><page sequence="23">I'art africain: L'Evolution de la connaissance de l'art africain des annies trente d aujourd'hui (Arnouville: Arts d'Afrique Noire, 1990), pp. 61-62. 33. Corin, "Refiguring the Person," p. 92. The author also notes how the healer traces white marks around the woman's eyes "to represent the 'second look' she will acquire, while entranced, as to what really caused her disease and triggered the spirit's inter- vention"; ibid., p. 93. Some Luluwa figures, especially those carved in the naturalistic style proper to the Bakwa Ndoolo sub- group, show the same white circles around the eyes (see Figure 17). 34. Frobenius, "Bena Lulua," LF 3, pp. 13-14. One of these Chokwe-inspired motifs is the crosslike mark on the forehead called kartoza; see also Tshisanda, "Le Theme de la maternite," p. 60; and compare with Marie-Louise Bastin, Art dicoratif tshokwe, Subsidios para a Hist6ria, Arqueologia e Etnografia dos Povos da Lunda Publicacoes Culturais 55 (Lisbon: Companhia de Diamantes de Angola and Museu do Dundo, 1961), vol. 1, pp. 137-39. Prosper Denolf (Aan de rand, p. 121) also recog- nizes the regional variations in patterns and designs and notes that certain Luluwa and Luba-Lubilanji subgroups shared the practice of raised scars with the Kuba. 35. The same body decorations can be seen in Norman Hardy's 1908 watercolors and sketches of women of the Tetela Sungu subgroup; see Emil Torday and Thomas A. Joyce, Notes ethno- graphiques sur des populations habitant les bassins du Kasai et du Kwango oriental, Ethnographie, Anthropologie, Annales 2, no. 2 (Tervuren: Musee du Congo Belge, 1922), chap. 2. Inspired by Jules-Auguste Fourche and Henri Morlighem's book Une Bible noire (Brussels: Max Arnold, 1973), Mubumbila Mfika reads one of Hardy's drawings of a Sungu woman in the light of Luba cos- mogony; Mubumbila, Sur le sentier mysterieux des nombres noirs (Paris: L'Harmattan, 1988), p. 138, fig. 30. The field photo- graph byJoseph Maes, on which the postcard reproduced in this article is based, was made during a collecting expedition for the RMCA in 1913-14; see also Maes, Notes sur les populations des bassins du Kasai, de la Lukenie, et du Lac Liopold II, Miscellanees, Annales 1, no. 1 (Tervuren: Musee du Congo Belge, 1924), chap. 5. 36. Denolf (Aan de rand, pp. 321-23) discusses the political and cul- tural affinities between the Luluwa and neighboring Kasai peo- ples, on the one hand, and the Mongo, on the other. Jan Vansina also points to the mediating role that Luluwa and Luiba- Lubilanji peoples played in the Mongo influence on cults and religious associations among the Kuba; Vansina, "Miko mi Yool, une association religieuse kuba," Aequatoria 22, no. 3 (1959), pp. 84-88; and idem, "Les Mouvements religieux kuba (Kasai) a l'epoque coloniale," Etudes d'Histoire africaine 2 (1971), p. 170. 37. On the Bakwa Mushilu and Bakwa Ndoolo substyles, see Paul Timmermans, "Essai de typologie de la sculpture des Bena Luluwa du Kasai," Africa-Tervuren 12, no. 1 (1966), pp. 20-22. Although this author equates the substyle of the Bakwa Mushilu with that of the neighboring Beena Tshikulu, the only object collected among the latter, reproduced here as Figure 9, is styl- istically quite distinct from the typical Bakwa Mushilu figures. Many of the well-known Luluwa figures collected by Wissmann and his traveling companions in the last quarter of the 19th cen- tury, which are now mainly at the Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin, also originate from northern Luluwa subgroups such as the Bakwa Mpika and the Beena Mba(a)la; see Petridis, cat. nos. 147, 148, in Afrika, pp. 223-24. Rik Ceyssens (personal communication, February i, 1998), however, wonders whether most naturalistic Luluwa figures originated in the northern part of the Luluwa region because until May 25, 1891, the first explorers did not travel south of the 6th parallel, being the southern border of the Congo Free State. 38. Frobenius also collected the above-mentioned (see note 25 and Figure 13) cup-bearing Bwanga bwa Bwimpe figure now at the Detroit Institute of Arts among the Bakwa Mbusha (Baqua Mbuscha) in the area between Lwebo and the Luluwa River. Karel Timmermans (personal communication, October 17, 1996), a Belgian art collector and former resident of Kananga (formerly Luluabourg), acquired an almost identical piece in the same Luluwa region north of Ndemba; for illustrations, see Riceptacles, exh. cat., Musee Dapper (Paris: Editions Dapper, 1997), pp. 1oo-o11. 39. The Byeeng belong to the Southern Kuba; it was in one of their chiefdoms, Ndombe, which also encompassed a number of Northern Kete villages, that Starr made some interesting field photographs; see Frederick Starr, Congo Natives: An Ethnographic Album (Chicago: Lakeside Press, 1912), pp. 16-17, pls. 10-12; andJan Vansina, The Children of Woot: A History of the Kuba Peoples (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1978), p. 358, n. 4. Frobenius refers to these Kete villages of the Byeeng chiefdom as "Bakete Ndumbis" ("Nord-Bakete," LF 2, pp. 39-45). Fro- benius also writes that the Luluwa produced figures for neigh- boring peoples such as the Luba and the Songye, as well as for certain Tetela enclaves ("Bena Lulua," LF 3, p. 23). 40.

The eth- nonyms Songo Meno, Yaelima, and Ohindo are believed to be synonyms for Ndengesh. For field-based data on other Mongo visual art forms, see Gustaaf Hulstaert, "Les Cercueils des Eleku," Aequatoria 22, no. 1 (1959), pp. 10-15; idem, "Les Cer- cueils anthropomorphes," Aequatoria 23, no. 4 (1960), pp. 121- 29; and esp. de Heusch, "La Beaute est ailleurs," pp. 188-204. 43. SeeJan Vansina, "Du Royaume kuba au 'territoire des Bakuba,'" Etudes congolaises 12, no. 2 (1969), pp. 26-27, 32-33, 39. It is interesting to note that the sculptures that Starr collected in the mixed ethnic area around the town of Lwebo for the American Museum of Natural History consist of a large number of rudi- mentary half- and full-figures but not a single refined and elabo- rately carved Luluwa figure. These figurative carvings are generally labeled as "Kete" and "Luba"-referring to Luba emi- grants from along the Lubilanji River-but their style makes them indistinguishable from schematically carved Luluwa figures. It should be mentioned that many of the objects which Frederick Starr brought back from the Congo were field- collected by Reverend Samuel P. Verner; see Enid Schildkrout, "Personal Styles and Disciplinary Paradigms: Frederick Starr and Herbert Lang," in The Scramble for Art in Central Africa, Schildkrout and Curtis A. Keim, eds. (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 172. 44. Frans Olbrechts, Plastiek van Kongo, with assistance from Albert Maesen (Antwerp: Standaard-Boekhandel, 1946), pp. 52-63; 257</page><page sequence="24">see also Ivan Lermolieff [Giovanni Morelli], Die Werke Italien- ischer Meister in den Galerien von Miinchen, Dresden und Berlin: Ein Kritischer Versuch, trans. Johannes Schwarze (Leipzig: E. A. See- mann, 1880). However, Vansina ("Ndop," p. 50) writes that "to speak of a court style obliterates the major stylistic distinctions observable in Kuba art: those between the various geographical areas and, even more important, that separating masks and other ritual objects ... from purely secular work"; see also idem, "Kuba Arts and Its Cultural Context," African Forum 3, no. 4, and 4, no. 1 (1968), p. 22. Elsewhere, the author emphasizes the important cultural, sociopolitical, and religious differences between the Luba and the Luluwa peoples, on the one hand, and the Kuba, on the other; Jan Vansina, "L'Etat kuba dans le cadre des institutions politiques africaines," Zaire 11, no. 5 (1957), p. 488; and idem, "Miko mi Yool," p. 92. Not only was there little contact between these peoples until relatively recently, the Kuba even disdained the Luba and the Luluwa, who in turn feared the Kuba. 45. Such drinking horns are also depicted hanging from the shoul- der on Luluwa figures that represent high-ranking chiefs; see Petridis, cat. no. 108, in Treasures, pp. 330-31; and idem, cat. no. 147, in Afrika, pp. 223-24. It remains uncertain whether these objects were made by the Luluwa themselves or were imported from the neighboring Kuba. Among the Kuba, they also serve as status symbols and are used for the consumption of palm wine; see Jan Vansina, cat. nos. 146, 147, in Kings of Africa: Art and Authority in Central Africa. Collection Museum fur Vilk- erkunde Berlin, Erna Beumers and Hans-Joachim Koloss, eds., exh. cat., MECC, Maastricht (Maastricht: Foundation Kings of Africa, 1992), pp. 319-20; and David A. Binkley, cat. no. 132, in Treasures, p. 341. Curiously, Albert Maesen was told that the piece he collected in the Luluwa village of Mutefu, now at the RMCA (inv. no. RG 53.74.4445), had been carved by a Chokwe sculptor from Tshikapa; Maesen, field notebook no. 30 (1954), p. 57. This drinking horn, which was used for palm wine, was the property of a so-called leopard chief (mukalenga wa nkashaama), the highest rank of chieftainship. 46. For a discussion of a well-known Kuba ndop figure at the Brook- lyn Museum of Art, see David A. Binkley, cat. no. 54, in Africa: The Art of a Continent. ioo Works of Power and Beauty, exh. cat., Guggenheim Museum, New York (New York: Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, 1996), p. 113. Following Olbrechts, scholars have grouped Luluwa art with the Luba-Katanga rather than the Kuba; see esp. Herman Burssens, "Congo Belga," in Enciclopedia universale dell'arte, vol. 3 (Venice and Rome: Istituto per la Collaborazione Culturale, 1958), pp. 777-78; and Albert Maesen, "Styles et experience esth6tique dans la plastique con- golaise," Problemes d'Afrique Centrale 44 (1959), p. 84. However, although Luluwa and Luba-Katanga peoples show a predilec- tion for the depiction of female figures, on a purely stylistic level Luluwa art has very little in common with that of the Luba- Katanga. 47. August De Clercq rightfully points out Wissmann's ethnocentric usage of terms such as "cult," "priestess," and "sacred symbol" in relation to the smoking of hemp by Kalamba Mukenge and his followers and underlines the political dimension of the newly established bwanga; De Clercq, "Practische wenken over de ethnographische waarnemingen in Kongo," Onze Kongo 3 (1912-13), pp. 233-35; and idem, "Le Chanvre chez les Bena Lulua: Origine, signification et influence de l'usage du chanvre," Congo i, no. 4 (1928), pp. 504-5. For an in-depth discussion of hemp use and its various political implications, see Ceyssens, Balungu, pp. 152-59, 166-67. 48. Until the 1960s, hemp was related to chieftainship and ancestor worship, which was often accompanied by the smoking of hemp; see Nelson, "Child Rearing Patterns," p. 175. Early sources clearly indicate that, at the end of the i9th century, excessive hemp consumption led to serious health problems. These developments, together with famine and widespread pneumonia, not only led to an antihemp campaign by mission- aries and colonials, but also provoked significant internal oppo- sition to the newly established bwanga. In a letter of June 12, 1894, published in the journal Missions en Chine et au Congo 74 (1895), p. 31, August De Clercq gives a telling, though surely not neutral, account of the state of affairs at the time: "L'usage du chanvre fum6 comme du tabac, provoque ici les effets de l'opium dans l'Orient, l'affaiblissement rapide du corps et l'abrutissement de l'intelligence.... Des hommes de trente ans ont le visage decr6pit d'un vieillard et la physionomie d'un idiot.... A ce compte, on comprend ais6ment que nos fumeurs soient d'une paresse sans 6gal" (Here, hemp smoking has the same effects as opium in the East, rapid weakening of the body and stupefying of the mind.... Thirty-year old men have the decrepit face of an elder and the physiognomy of an idiot.... It is therefore easy to understand the unequaled laziness of our hemp smokers); see also Wissmann, Unter deutscherFlagge, p. 98; Constant De Deken, Deux ans au Congo (Antwerp: Clement Thibaut, 1900), pp. 218, 240; and Leo Frobenius, Im Schatten des Kongostaates: Bericht der Verlauf der Ersten Reisen der D.I.A.F E. von i904-90o6 (Berlin: G. Reimer, 1907), p. 238. 49. Wissmann et al., Im Innern Afrikas, pp. 266-67. When Ludwig Wolf, one of Wissmann's traveling companions, acquired the famous chief figure now at the Berlin Ethnologisches Museum from a rival of Kalamba Mukenge, he threatened to hand the rival over to Kalamba Mukenge if he refused to give Wolf the figure; see ibid., pp. 265-66. Nevertheless, according to Wiss- mann, the Bakwa Mpika, among whom he collected a fine Bwanga bwa Bwimpe figure holding a walking cane in one hand, also at the Berlin Ethnologisches Museum, were loyal to Kalamba Mukenge and belonged to the beena dyamba; ibid., p. 215. 50. See Wissmann et al., Im Innern Afrikas, p. 166. Wolf states that both chief Kalamba Mukenge and his ally chief Tshinkenke pro- hibited scarification as part of their religious reform; Ludwig Wolf, "Anthropologischen Untersuchungen in Central-Afrika," ZeitschriftfiirEthnologie 16 (1884), p. 424. 51. Frobenius, "Bena Lulua," LF 3, pp. 13-14. Curiously, what is purported to be a portrait of Kalamba Mukenge shows a man who is literally bedecked with complex curvilinear scarifications; see Wissmann et al., Im Innern Afrikas, p. 165 (see also Figure 15). But it should be mentioned that according to Prosper Denolf (Aan de rand, p. 336), Kalamba Mukenge was not an autochtonous Luluwa chief but a Luba-Lubilanji immigrant of the Bakwa Diishi subgroup who had crossed the Lubi River to overtake the local chief of the Luluwa Bakwa Mushilu subgroup, Mwamba Mputu. Rik Ceyssens (personal communication, Sep- tember 30, 2000), however, draws attention to the fact that the hemp cult was a very short-lived movement and that scarifica- tions could not simply be erased. 52. See Fourche and Morlighem, Communications, p. 55. Henri Morlighem ("Notes sur quelques f6tiches," see note 18 above) writes that the half-figure of the Beena Tshikulu subgroup, which is reproduced here as Figure 9, was placed on a grave. 258</page></plain_text>
