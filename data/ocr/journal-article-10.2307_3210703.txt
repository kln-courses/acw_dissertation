<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Landscape Comes to Life By Elizabeth Bloch-Smith and Beth Alpert Nakhai T HE IRON I IS A FASCINATING YET FRUSTRATING PERIOD in the history of the territory now covered by the mod- em states of Israel and Jordan. This period is fascinating because over the course of its two hundred years (ca. 1200-1000 BCE), the Iron I landscape witnessed the formation of the social, economic, and political foundations of Israel, Judah, Philistia, Ammon, Moab, and Edom. Frustration results from ambiguous archaeological evidence and from difficul- ties in dating and interpreting biblical texts as they pertain to national origins.1 The story of the Iron I is, in part, the biblical story of the transition from the city-states of Canaan to the United Monarchy of Israel. A major element in this transition was the founding of hundreds of small villages, renewing a land- scape that had been uninhabited or sparsely inhabited in the Late Bronze Age (LBA). As noted by many, the stages in this transition are difficult to date and define with precision (Dever 1992a:18). The story of the Iron I is also the story of the emergence of distinct groups on the borders of what would become Israel. The peoples of Iron I Transjordan would develop into the Iron II nations of Ammon, Moab, and Edom, as Aram would develop in the north. In contrast, neither the Philistines to Israel's west nor the Phoenicians on the northern Mediter- ranean coast ever formed nations with political structures similar to that of Israel. For them, the Bronze Age city-state model prevailed over the new concept of nationhood under a single king. Perhaps, then, what characterized the Iron I is that it was the era in which the peoples of the southern Levant begin to develop their own individual identities, iden- tities that would provide the basis for nationhood in subsequent centuries.2 The Shechem plain, looking northeast, with Tell Balatah at the lower left.

The third major element in the story of the Iron I is that of new relationships among the peoples of southern Canaan- between indigenous and non-native populations, urban and rural dwellers, and pastoralists and agriculturalists. From the interplay among these various groups would develop the interesting mix of people who would become the nation of Israel and its many neighbors. The dynamics of the Iron I would color the later United and Divided Monarchies in many ways, as the strongly regional character of its two hun- dred years would provide the background for later fragmentation in Israel and Judah.3 The background for developments in the Iron I can be found in the LBA (1550-1150 BCE). This period began with a century of Eighteenth Dynasty military campaigns designed 62 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) .^^-d~g6|^a i p. il ^^NI^siK ',*., * j 1, ., , )rrcr: -CfmlL.: ;</page><page sequence="2">The Iron I Period to bring South Canaan to its knees and ended with the vir- tual demise of the Egyptian empire in Western Asia. Egypt had stationed garrisons at strategic locations throughout Canaan, and the indigenous peoples paid tribute to Egypt, including victuals for their agriculturally stressed over- lord. In the late thirteenth through early eleventh centuries, as drought and famine devastated parts of Western Asia, as Aegean and Anatolian peoples moved south, as interna- tional trade dwindled, and as Egypt was increasingly challenged by problems in Canaan, Egyptian hegemony ended. The reign of Rameses VI (1141-1134) offered the last significant evidence of Egyptian presence in the region (Weinstein 1981:23). The power vacuum created by the collapse of LBA empires contributed to the shifts in demographics and set- tlement patterns that would typify the Iron I landscape (Dever 1992c). International trade during the LBA II is well-attested. Material culture remains and burials both highlight the pres- ence of many foreigners in Canaan during this period of time. Among these were people from Hittite country as well as from Cyprus, Crete, and elsewhere in the Aegean and Myce- nean worlds. At the end of the LBA II, the destruction of Ugarit on the Syrian coast underscored the massive human dislocation which set the background for the Iron I. Surveys, excavations, and serendipitous finds yield a var- iegated picture of settlement. Once domestic, cultic, and monumental structures-situated in isolation and in ham- lets, villages, towns, and cities-have been mapped, it still remains to people the structures. Who lived at the sites? Where did they come from? Why did they settle in these loca- tions? What were their social, economic, political, and religious institutions? What were their ethnic affiliations?4 Without written evidence indicating a group's affiliation or clarifying how, for example, others regarded it, it is very difficult to establish ethnic identity. Utilizing archaeological remains, one might try to compare a highland, rural "Israelite" assemblage to a lowland, urban "Canaanite" assemblage. Twelfth century Ta'anach material culture demonstrates the difficulty of such a comparison: it is similar to that of con- temporary highland villages, while the contemporary material culture of nearby Meggido preserves LBA traditions. Eth- nicity is also difficult to determine at sites that according to the Bible passed between Israelite and Philistine control and produced mixed material culture assemblages. For example, Tell el-Batashi Str. V was a densely built, fortified Philistine town. Nearby Beth Shemesh ll yielded material culture iden- tical to Tell Batashi, with abundant Philistine bichrome pots. However, according to 1 Sam 6:9-15, Beth Shemesh was an Israelite town. While the Hebrew Bible is an unabashedly theological document that must be used with great caution for historical purposes, it remains a valuable-but not infal- lible-resource for documenting Israelite perceptions of ethnic affiliation.

The identification of ethnic identity from material culture continues to prove one of archaeology's stiffest challenges. Little is as clear as (from left to right) the Canaanite bust from Ugarit (ca. 14th-13th c.), the Sea Peoples warrior from Medinet Habu (ca. 12th c.), or the Hittite in low relief from Kerkamis (ca. 9th c.). Textual Evidence for the Iron I Extra-biblical Evidence No extra-biblical texts originating during the Iron I illu- minate our understanding of this period. However, documents from the years leading up to the twelfth century help clarify the varied nature of the population of Canaan at the end of the LBA II. Several of the Amara Letters, a corpus of four- teenth century Canaanite texts found in Egypt, mention a people called capiru, who caused trouble for the Canaanite princes writing the letters and for their Egyptian over- lords. These Capiru have been related to the biblical Hebrews (Leonard 1989:19; Miller and Hayes 1986:65-67 and refer- ences there). The shasu, apparently a pastoralist group, were also singled out for creating problems for Canaanite city- dwellers and for the Egyptians on both sides of the Jordan River. The Papyrus Anastasi I, dated to the second half of the thirteenth century, noted bands of shasu in the "mountains of Shechem" (Weinstein 1981:17-21; B. Mazar 1981:75; and see below). The Merneptah Stele (ca. 1207 BCE) presents the earliest written mention of Israel. Among those conquered by the pharaoh Mereptah, it listed a people called "Israel," located within the land of Canaan (Na'aman 1994:247-49). Rameses III's battles against the Sea Peoples, including the Peleset, Tjeker, Shekelesh, Denye[n], and Weshesh are depicted on the walls of the Temple of Amon in Medinet Habu (B. Mazar 1981:79). Some among these Aegean peoples soon settled along the Canaanite coast. Taken together, these LBA II ref- erences tell us about some of the rural and roving peoples who were part of the social fabric of Canaan. Though they may be difficult to trace archaeologically, they were impor- tant constituents of the Iron I population of the southern Levant. Biblical Texts: The Era of Conquest and Settlement The Hebrew Bible is a theological document that attained its final form long after the events it reported. Regional set- tlement and control were described in the context of Israel's providential history and often reflect the situation later in Israel's monarchical history. The vision of Israelite conquest and settlement comes from the late seventh to sixth centuries BCE Deuteronomists, and, therefore, all specific ref- erences must be scrutinized within the context of their perspective. Who Was There? Despite its temporal remove, the Hebrew Bible is use- ful in suggesting ethnic groups who lived in Canaan during the LBA or who entered it late in that period. To the extent that the text is descriptive of the Iron I, these groups may be counted among the peoples of the southern Levant. First among them were the Canaanites and Amorites (Num 21:21-26), by all accounts the original inhabitants of the land (B. Mazar 1981:76). Gen 10:15-20 describes Canaan as Noah's grandson, the patriarch of many of the peoples the Israelites are later said to encounter as they settled down in the land of Canaan. Their territory included land from Sidon to Gaza and east to the Dead Sea. Other indigenous peoples whom the Bible portrays as Israel's adversaries were Edomites (Gen 36), Moabites (Num 21:10-15), Ammonites (Num 20:14-21), Amalekites (Exod 17:8-16; Deut 25:17-19), and Midianites (Exod 2:15-16; 3:1; Num 31:1-12). Each group had a territory of its own, and the Bible viewed all as Israel's antagonists. The main issues were Israel's safe passage through the respective territories while travelling to the Promised Land, and Israel's religious integrity, or loss thereof (Judg 10:6-16). Other passages mention recent arrivals, the Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, and Jebusites, among the 64 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="4">p Albrecht Alt and William F. Albright founded and represented the two most prominent "camps" of scholarly opinion with respect to the roots of Israelite society during the early decades of the twentieth century. Albright hewed his model more closely in line with the biblical story, while Alt denied that the Israelites were military invaders from outside of Canaan. peoples to be eradicated from Canaan as Joshua and his tribal forces conquered the land (Gen 13:7; 15:18-21; Num 21:1; Deut 7:1-6; 20:17; Josh 3:10; 9:1-2; Judg 1:4; 11:21-23). These non-native groups, each of which settled in the rela- tively unoccupied central hill country (and perhaps in Transjordan as well), arrived in southern Canaan as a result of the enormous turmoil at the end of the LBA (B. Mazar 1981:76-79; see Nacaman 1994:240-41 for further docu- mentation). Archaeological data would extend this list to include the Philistines, described in the books of Judges and Samuel, who arrived at the same time from the Aegean and Mycenean worlds (udg 13-16; 1 Sam 5; and others). That the "conquest" goals were not efficiently met is made clear by Judg 3:1-6, which condemns relationships between the Israelites and members of these groups. The Bible also numbers the Sidonians (osh 11:8) and Egyp- tians (Exod 1-15), both located beyond the bounds of later Israel, among Israel's enemies. Egypt, of course, was the great- est oppressor of all. Interestingly, the biblical story places that oppression within the borders of Egypt, although Egypt's record as an exploiter of the population of LBA Canaan has become increasingly apparent in recent years (Ahituv 1978; Weinstein 1981; Singer 1994:284 and references there). How Did It Happen? The books of Joshua and Judges record varying versions of the Israelite conquest of Canaan. After the death of Moses at Mt. Nebo, his successor Joshua is said to have led the Israelite tribes in a well-planned and complete conquest of Canaan. Joshua carried out three major military campaigns. The first included the crossing of the Jordan River, the mirac- ulous fall of the city of Jericho to Yahweh's holy warriors, the capture of (Ai and Gibeon, and finally, the invasion of the hill country around Jerusalem (Josh 1:1-10:29). The second cam- paign, presented more tersely, ended with the conquest of the southern cities of Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, Eglon, Hebron, and Debir (Josh 10:28-43). The final, northern campaign resulted in the conquest of Hazor (Josh 11:1-13:7). As a result, the Canaanite inhabitants were allegedly deci- mated and their land divided among the twelve Israelite tribes (Josh 13-22). The presentation in the book of Judges differs signifi- cantly from that in Joshua. In describing the situation in Canaan following the death of Joshua, Judges evokes an era in which Israelites and Canaanites lived side by side, sometimes amicably and at other times antagonistically (Judg 2:11-23). In times of crisis, judges led the Israelites in attacks against their enemies (Judg 3:7-8; 4:1-2; 6:1, and others), but many years seem to have passed peacefully (Judg 3:11, 30; 5:31, and others). Recently, scholars studying the question of the Israelite settlement have suggested that Judges represents a more accurate account of the relationship between Israelites and Canaanites in the hill country than does Joshua (Miller and Hayes 1986:90-91; Dever 1990:79). This is curious since both Judges and Joshua are the work of the Deuteronomistic historians (see Cross 1973:274-89 and references there). Opin- ions are divided about the amount of original material available to the Deuteronomistic historians, but most scholars support the idea of a core of early material. Even a proponent of a "minimalist " point of view such as Van Seters (Van Seters 1983; see Nacaman 1994:222 and fn. 11) concedes pre-Deuteron- omistic materials. Just how early that material might be continues to be debated (see below). Still, the period described in Judges preceded history writing by centuries. The absence of first-hand documentation frustrates its historical inves- tigation (NaCaman 1994:227-30). Many conquest stories in Joshua were modeled on monarchical era military episodes (Na'aman 1994:259), the same might also be true for cer- tain of the Judges passages, such as Judges 6-8 (Payne 1983:169). In general, the Judges material demands exhaustive criti- cal analysis on a par with that of the Joshua material.

However, CAi's Iron I remains at the site have fed scholarly reconstructions of the newly emergent village life. Models for Understanding Israelite Settlement The "Big Three" Over the past fifty years and more, most significant efforts made to understand the Iron I have focused upon elucidat- ing the process of Israelite settlement in Canaan. This has created a skewed perspective. As we shall see, the Iron I was a period which saw the settlement of diverse peoples, but often other cultures have not been examined as fully as have the Israelites. In the past, three models for understanding Israelite ori- gins and the process of the Israelite occupation of Canaan have prevailed. Each utilized-or rejected-various biblical texts and to some degree incorporated archaeological evidence. Since numerous easily accessible sources summarize the main points of each model and draw attention to the original pub- lications (see, for example, Finkelstein 1988b:295-314; Dever 1990:37-84; 1992; 1997), the presentation here will be brief. In 1923, biblical scholar Albrecht Alt presented a view of the roots of Israelite society that differed radically from the biblical perspective. In his opinion, Israelites were not mil- itary invaders from outside of Canaan, but rather pastoral nomads in the process of immigrating and settling down throughout the Iron I. That Israelite ancestors were pastoralists was, according to Alt, supported by the patriarchal stories in Genesis. Alt also cited evidence for an early settlement in the hill country, followed by a later expansion into the Canaanite lowlands (Alt 1966:135-69). Critics of this peaceful infiltration theory have noted the impossibility of proving an infiltration of outsiders into the hill country in this period (Finkelstein 1988b:304). Other scholars, including Martin Noth, followed Alt's lead, but their ideas met with great opposition by William F Albright and his followers, in part because they did not account for the archaeologically documented destructions of numerous sites. The Conquest Model, first formulated by Albright in the 1930s, was based upon a growing number of archaeological excavations at major tell sites in Palestine. In this model, Joshua, as it describes an all-out Israelite 66 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="6">Pastoralist encampment from the early twentieth century. Many of the current models of Iron Age settlement in the Southern Levant resort to some model of pastoral sedentarization to explain the burst of highland settlement. Photograph from the Matson Collection, Library of Congress, Washington, DC. military campaign against the cities of Canaan subsequent to the Exodus from Egypt and the desert wanderings, pro- vides an accurate description of the process of the Israelite settlement in Canaan. Adherents cited the archaeologically attested destruction of Hazor, inter alia, as support for this hypothesis (Wright 1960:49-50). However, data from other alleged conquest sites, such as Jericho and 'Ai, have not pro- vided collaborative evidence for Israelite destructions. Additionally, some sites not mentioned as having been destroyed by the Israelites have revealed evidence for Iron I destructions (Dever 1990:56-60). In consequence, it has become clear that the biblical description of the Joshua conquest can- not be taken at face value. Another of Albright's contributions to the discussion of Israelite settlement was his development of the concept of "fossil types " which could be used to identify Israelites at settlements throughout the hill country. Among these identifiers were the collared-rim storejar, the plaster-lined cistern, agricultural terracing, and the four-room house (Albright 1960:112-18; Shiloh 1970:180; Esse 1991). Researchers accepted the idea that settlements could be classified as Israelite through the presence of some configuration of these fossil types for many years. More recently, however, researchers have noted these features in pre-Israelite and non-Israelite sites. They are now better understood not as indicative of ethnic identification but rather as reflective of subsistence strategies (Hopkins 1987:182-84; London 1989). For exam- ple, the construction of terraces was not the reason that people were initially able to inhabit the hill country; rather, it was one way in which they were able to make long-term adap- tations to their environment (Dever 1990:80). In the 1960s, George E. Mendenhall presented a third hypothesis. He suggested that Israelites were in fact Canaan- ites who left their native city-states in the last centuries of the LBA and became dissident elements within the Canaan- ite countryside. He identified these "outlaws " with the Capiru of the Amama Letters. Ultimately, in Mendenhall's opinion, these dissidents, fueled by passionate loyalty to their god Yahweh, came to form a new ethnic group known as the Israelites (Mendenhall 1962). Norman K. Gottwald further developed this model, describing the withdrawal of Canaan- ites from their native city-states as a "Peasants' Revolt " against socio-economic inequities (Gottwald 1979). Some later scholars disputed the notion that the hill country set- tlers came directly out of the Canaanite urban world, and noted the theory's limited utilization of archaeological data (Finkelstein 1988b:307-8). In addition, others argued that the model's sociological interpretation of Israelite ori- gins draws upon ideas of class conflict that can be neither substantiated nor repudiated. Continuing Developments in the Theory of Iron I Settlement More recent archaeologically-based reconstructions of the Iron I make little attempt to reconcile the biblical account with the archaeological record. While the Bible contends the Israelite tribes battled with, and in many cases defeated, the indigenous populations of Canaan to settle in the highlands, archaeologists equivocate. They attribute the increased high- land population to waves of Israelite tribes (Aharoni 1970), the settling of indigenous pastoralists or nomads (Bunimovitz 1994; Finkelstein 1988b; Fritz 1987; Rainey 1994), or the relo- cation of Canaanite farmers (Dever 1990). Historians are admonished not to accept the biblical attribution of the destruc- tion of Canaanite cities to Israelites, but rather to consider Philistines, Egyptians, Transjordanian peoples, and even other Canaanites as the vanquishers. Scholars variously inter- pret the renewed highland settlement as arising in a void resulting from the dissolution of the LBA urban civiliza- tion (Finkelstein, Nacaman, Dever) or in a renewed stability under the aggressive Egyptian Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties (Bunimovitz). The new theories attempt to explain the results of recent surveys and circumscribed excavations. In the last three decades, hundreds of Iron I farmsteads, hamlets, and vil- lages have been identified through excavation and survey in the Beersheba Valley, the length of the central highlands, the Galilee, and Transjordan. As a result of this work, it has become clear that in the last centuries of the second millen- nium BCE, this region's inhabitants founded many small, rural settlements. They were generally unwalled and incorporated those features necessary for self-sufficient, small-scale farm- ers and herders engaged in limited cottage industry. Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 67</page><page sequence="7">Drawing on his northern highlands survey results, archae- ologist Israel Finkelstein suggested that this region provided the core of early Israelite settlement. In his opinion, the set- tlers at these new sites were Canaanite pastoralists who had been in the region since the end of the Middle Bronze Age, but who, due to changed circumstances at the end of the LBA, began to settle down in the hill country. In debunking the theory of a "demographic socio-economic, and cultural rev- olution " and arguing that the settlers were not refugees from the LBA Canaanite city-states, Finkelstein (1988b:352-53) at first embraced Alt's view of a peaceful nomadic infiltra- tion from the east. In his later works, he has abandoned this idea, while still suggesting that the hill country settle- ment was part of a cyclical pattern of sedentarization and abandonment (1994; 1995). As a result of his excavation at Tel Masos, an Iron I town in the northern Negev, archaeologist Volkmar Fritz developed the Symbiosis Hypothesis. He described the Iron I settlers as semi-nomadic tribes who came from a culture interdependent with Canaanite city-dwellers. Their earlier close relations with LBA Canaanites were typical of the sym- biotic relationship between semi-nomads and urbanites known as enclosed nomadism (Rowton 1974). The fact that semi-nomads cyclically settle down would account for their ability to adapt quickly to village life in previously unoc- cupied territory. Their historic proximity to Canaanite city-dwellers would explain their adoption of the cultural markers of Canaanite city life (Fritz 1981:70-71;1987:98). This "Symbiosis" model attracted the attention of archae- ologist William G. Dever, according to whom it offers the best explanation for the Iron I evidence. The Iron I was a period of great and sudden demographic shifts, as the cen- tral hill country, lower Galilee, and northern Negev became populated by Canaanites living in new, small, unwalled villages. In Dever's opinion, the archaeological material, par- ticularly those ceramic assemblages retrieved from highland villages, shows continuity with LBA urban Canaanite tradi- tions. In addition, the agricultural sophistication with which the newcomers farmed such sites as 'Izbet Sartah and Tel Masos suggests agrarian rather than pastoralist roots. The settlers of the hill country are best understood as "proto- Israelites:" that is, as Canaanites in the process of becoming Israelites. The Israelite settlement "...was a gradual, exceed- ingly complex process, involving social, economic, and political-as well as religious-change, with many regional variations" (Dever 1990:78-79; 1992c:103-4; 1997:25-26). Others agree that the Iron I setttlers shared a semi-nomadic origin. Archaeologist Shlomo Bunimovitz contends that, inas- much as the nomads and city dwellers had a symbiotic relationship, pastoralists would have continued to raise ani- mals and pursue other trades as long as the cities were functioning. At some sites, particularly those under Egypt- ian control, Canaanite urban life extended well into the twelfth century BCE. Thus, Bunimovitz puts a different spin on the movement of semi-nomads from the lowlands to the hill country and their establishment of villages there in the decades before the collapse of the Egyptian empire in Canaan. It para- doxically underscores the increasing strength of imperial Egypt in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties. The Egyp- tians may even have had a part in forcing the sedentarization of previously pastoral peoples (Bunimovitz 1994). Both 0ystein LaBianca and Anson Rainey cite food pro- curement as the factor that precipitated Iron I settlement. According to LaBianca, the critical need to procure food drove the lifestyle and social organization of the LBA and IA peo- ples of Transjordan. The institutions of their society were structured so as to facilitate efficient access to adequate food resources. The process of settlement intensification and abate- ment reflects the ways in which people exploit their environment. The more intensively land is farmed, the more people adopt sedentary lifestyles. The converse is also true; as people move toward livestock production, they migrate seasonally and resume a nomadic way of life (LaBianca 1990; LaBianca and Younker 1995). In the IA, changes in the availability of food promoted more intense land use and, thus, help to explain why the highlands experienced such a surge of settlement. Noting a decline in annual rainfall in the eastern Mediter- ranean, historian Rainey posited a concomitant decline in food production that led to a reduced Canaanite urban pop- ulation. Markets for pastoralists' goods dwindled significantly. In consequence, pastoralists were drawn to the relatively unoccupied hill country, where they could settle down and produce their own grain (Rainey 1994:84). Nadav Nacaman's recent work focusses upon textual analysis, examining Joshua-Judges 1 in light of what is known about IA historiographic writing. In his opinion, a combi- nation of factors, including migrations, demographic change and the sedentarization of nomads, best explain the Iron I settlement (Nacaman 1994). Ilan Sharon analyzes demographic theories, looking at the variables of population growth, resources, social organization, and technology in his dis- cussion of LBA Canaanite collapse and Iron I Israelite consolidation. He sees Canaanite demographic decrease and Israelite demographic increase as causal factors for the great changes of the era (Sharon 1994). Critique of Settlement Models The various theories either fail to address or propose con- tradictory explanations for fundamental features of early Israel. Where did the new highland settlers come from? Were they immigrant or indigenous nomads, urban refugees or the multitude fleeing Egypt? If immigrants, did they enter Canaan from the east or the west? Was their relationship with the autochthonous population hostile, amicable, or both? What factors promoted Israelite cohesion leading them to distin- guish themselves from their non-Israelite neighbors? What was the genesis of "Israel" of the Bible and the Merneptah stele? None of the models tackle the theological formation of early Israel, which was likely a catalyst toward nationhood as indicated by the theophoric name Isra-el. The archaeo- logical models provide descriptive but not explanatory frameworks. While the Symbiosis Model may best describe our current understanding of the physical relationship of the 68 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="8">35 Mediterranean (, .111 hK.

The following discussion attempts to account for and harmonize the bibli- cal and archaeological evidence of settlement and conquest. Texts continue to provide the only witness to the adoption of Yahweh by El worshippers in a Canaanite milieu. Archaeological Data Having reviewed the most influential theories designed to explain the process of Iron I settlement, let us turn to the archaeological data. It will help resolve the question of the origins of Israel and its neighbors in the Iron I. Regional development was one of the major character- istics of the Iron I. Occupation at some Bronze Age cities continued into the Iron I, allowing for the perpetuation of age-old indigenous traditions alongside somewhat more recent Egyptian and Aegean cultural and religious contri- butions. New settlements also sprang up: hundreds of small agricultural villages and hamlets founded in the hill coun- try of biblical Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, and Judah, as well as in the Negev and the Galilee. Aegean peoples, new- comers to the region, settled along the Mediterranean coast; Israelite and Egyptian sources name the Philistines in the south, and Tjekker, Sikila, and Sherdani farther north. Regional variation is apparent in Transjordan as well. In the land that would be called Ammon in the Iron II, many people lived in small villages in the Iron I, and social com- plexity is evident at some sites. The same is true for northern Moab. The future lands of southern Moab and Edom, on the other hand, remained the territory of pastoralists. By examining sites in geographical regions that seem to coincide with biblical tribal territories and with the bound- aries of non-Israelite nations of the Iron II, a picture emerges of localized socio-economic adaptations. Topography, sub- sistence resources and constraints, social and political organization as reflected in architecture, and material cul- ture all help us define the various territories and peoples of the Iron I. What follows is a study by geographic region of these territories and peoples. The Central Highlands Manasseh Territory ascribed to Manasseh (osh 15-16) encompassed wide, fertile valleys such as the Dothan and the Sanur. Con- venient transportation routes also facilitated settlement; east-west movement through the region was possible through Wadi Far'ah and the Brook of Shechem. With ca. 350-1000 mm of rainfall per year, the soils supported dense forests of evergreen oak and terebinth. Manasseh was the most densely settled hilly zone in LB II. Continuity of settlement from LB II into Iron I is demon- strated by the Shechem regional survey in southern Manasseh. Of the 22 LB II sites, 17 continued into Iron I. In addition, 8 new sites were founded in Iron IA. Iron Age pottery from the tell and surveyed sites, including those newly founded, continued the LBA traditions. All the identified sites were abandoned from ca. 1125 BCE until 975 BCE (Campbell 1991:93-%).

Most were located along the perimeter of the Dothan, Farcah, and Malih valleys (Finkelstein 1988b:89). In the northern and central parts of the surveyed region, Iron I settlements were founded along roads at the perimeters of or at junctions lead- ing into those valleys best-suited to grain agriculture. In the Dothan Valley, for example, new Iron I sites were located within one and a half kilometers of large LB II/Iron I tran- sitional sites. This clustering of sites along the road suggests economic relations among the traditional "Canaanite " and the newly founded Iron I "Israelite " settlements. The range of site size (.8-3.5 ha for those on the northern side of the Dothan Valley) precludes simplistic generalizing about social structure. Excavators have published in detail very few Iron I sites from Manasseh. Tell el-FarCah North (Tirzah) exemplifies an unfortified "Canaanite " town that was continuously settled from the LBA into the Iron Age. Iron Age inhabitants of the twelfth-eleventh century (Str. VIIa) founded their build- ings on LBA walls, but with new orientations. This was a planned town, with housing units and a possible domestic shrine or temple fronting a street (Chambon 1984:Plan I). Each excavated house measured approximately 100 m2 (build- ings 208, 210, 490). Building 490 is an early example of the "pillared" or "four-room" house, with two longitudinal rows of pillars dividing the front room into thirds and an elevated rear broadroom (Chambon 1984:19-21, fig. 1). Excavations at Mt.Ebal yielded a 1.4 ha Iron I site with a commanding view. The site's controversial altar (Joshua 8:30-32) has been published in detail (see below), but the set- tlement to the east of the temenos remains unexcavated. This site is atypical for Manasseh in its isolated hilltop location and distance from extensive agricultural land, suggesting that cultic reasons played a role in its selection. Both surveyors of this region have made biblically-inspired claims for initial settlement in the east with a westward expan- sion, but neither Zertal's nor Finkelstein's published surveys substantiate this scenario, as both lack reliable chronologi- cal indicators for dating sites (Finkelstein 1988b:349; 1994:160). The putative accompanying shift from dry farming and herd- ing to horticulture is similarly unproven; no patterned archaeological data undergird their reconstructions of a pastoral economy or horticulture.

The mountain watershed allowed north-south movement through the region as far south as Hebron, but blocked east-west travel. In the territory surveyed by Finkelstein, only five sites had been settled in the LBA, while Iron I witnessed some 120 new settlements, at relatively high elevations with good views of the surrounding region. Given their elevation, it is not sur- prising that terracing accompanied approximately one-quarter of the sites in antiquity, although it is difficult to determine which were terraced in Iron I. In the northern and eastern highlands, large villages out- numbered small ones. Settlement was most dense in the north where rainfall was the greatest. In the western foothills and far eastern desert fringe, small villages outnumbered large ones. Approximately half the surveyed sites in Ephraim were hamlets measuring less than .3 ha and consisting of a "few houses. " Most were situated approximately one kilo- meter from a larger village, on which they were likely economically dependent. Other hamlets existed in isolation, seemingly self-sufficient.

Each contained compounds of two or more houses, evocative of "the house- hold of Micah, " a compound consisting of multiple houses for family members and guests (Judg 17:5-18:31). Houses from both 'Ai and Radanna ranged in size from 43-80 m2, with walls sufficiently wide to carry a second story (Brae- mer 1982:166-69). Khirbet Radanna Sites S and T produced structures with a single, longitudinal pillared partition in the front room, a rear broadroom, and enclosures against exte- rior house walls (Callaway 1965,1993; Callaway and Cooley 1971). Villagers at both sites dug cisterns to store water, kept sheep and goats, and used stone saddles and querns to process grain grown on the terraced hillsides. Few objects were pre- served in the "Ai houses. At Radanna, however, house size, quality of construction, and small finds attest to occupational specialization, literacy, and a social and economic hierarchy among residents. The Site S compound was bigger, better built, and equipped with more installations and ancillary structures than the other compounds at the site.

Ajar handle incised with three letters in proto-Canaanite script, dated to around 1200 BCE, raises the possibility of literate settlers (Cross and Freedman 1971). Villagers aban- doned both sites in the mid-eleventh century. According to the account in Joshua, Bethel was originally assigned to the tribe of Benjamin (Josh 18:22), but shortly thereafter Ephraim claimed the city for its southern border (Judg 1:22-26).

At 180 m2, this house-with its walls of large field stones, stone-paved floors, and lack of a pil- lared partition-more closely resembles the buildings at Tell Belt Mirsim and Beth Shemesh, farther south, than the pillared houses of the central highlands. Khirbet ed-Dawwara, a .5 ha fort, was situated on a hilltop 10 km north- east of Jerusalem with a commanding view of the desert. The single-period settlement, interpreted as an Israelite outpost, functioned from the second half of the eleventh through the end of the tenth century BCE. A wall two to three meters wide encircled, and in some cases abutted, four three or four-room pillared houses, each measuring roughly 120 m2. Several rooms preserved hearths associated with cooking pots and col- lared-rim storejars, but excavators found no evidence for grain processing or addi- tional storage (Finkelstein 1988a). Judah "Judah" is used here as a regional designation rather than the biblical Greater Judah (Judg 15:1-12, 21-62). It refers to territory stretching from just north of Jerusalem, east to the Dead Sea, south to Beersheba (including the ter- ritory of Simeon), and, periodically, west to encompass the Shephelah (discussed below). The steep, forest-covered Hebron hills, like those of Ephraim to the north, provided neither easily cultivable val- leys nor east-west transit through the region. Only Jerusalem was strategi- cally located, at the juncture of the north-south highland route from Shechem to Hebron and the east-west pass which provided access from the coast to the Transjordanian plateau. Renewed settlement in the twelfth to mid-eleventh century produced 24 sites; 17 were tells or situated at high elevations, often clustered, and most were medium or large in size. These siz- able sites contrast with the predominantly small sites of the region in the LBA as well as with contemporary Iron Age sites in the highlands north of Jerusalem.

While many new settlements were founded beginning in the mid-eleventh through the tenth centuries, with a continued preference for large sites (Ofer 1994:104, fig. 5; his Iron IIA), a number of sites were abandoned. Some, including Tell en-Nasbeh, Tell Beit Mirsim, Beth-Zur, and Hebron were later resettled in Iron II (Mazar 1990:338). Settlers founded Giloh in the early twelfth century BCE on a ridge-top southwest of Jerusalem. The reconstructed site, interpreted as a "fortified herdsmen's village, " included a defensive tower. Fifty meters to the south, a perimeter wall enclosed an area of .6 ha with a pillared house and adja- cent animal pen. While lacking a convenient water source, the site was located near arable land with easy access to road- ways. Giloh's excavator considers the fragmentary remains of Building 8-restored with a pillared front room and rear broadroom-a prototype for later Israelite pillared houses. The limited and homogeneous pottery assemblage, consist- ing primarily of collared-rim pithoi and cooking pots, demonstrates continuity with LBA traditions. Sites elsewhere in the central highlands (Shiloh, Bethel, Tell el-Ful, Beth Zur) and in the Jezreel Valley (Megiddo, Taanach) yielded roughly contemporary ceramic parallels (A. Mazar 1981;1990:339-40). General Discussion: The Central Highlands What precipitated settlement in the central highlands? Archaeology provides no direct evidence of the impetus for settlement in the more remote and inhospitable highland regions, and the Bible alludes to the difficulties inherent in turning the hills into viable farmland (Josh 17:17-18). However, factors known to promote sedentarization among modern pastoralists likely applied to early Iron Age set- tlers as well. They include the need for improved security, the influence of adjacent cultures, and regional economic alternatives to pastorally-based subsistence (Finkelstein 1988b:345). For the central highlands, the continued vigor of Canaanite sites ringing the Dothan and other northern val- leys may have provided the impetus, political stability, and economic viability for the earliest Iron I sites in north- ern Manasseh. The central hill country consisted of discrete topographic units roughly corresponding to the tribal territories. These units varied in their characteristic settlement patterns and economic adaptations. In northern Manasseh, cereal crops flourished in the valleys, so new Iron I settlements founded adjacent to LBA sites along valley perimeters exploited the fertile valleys. In Ephraim, the northernmost settlements like- wise occupied valley edges, but at higher elevations. Farther south in Judah, settlements were less numerous, larger, and increasingly isolated. Similarly, settlements diminished in number east of the Jordan River from Ammon in the north through Moab in the south. In northern and central Manasseh, several sites located along valley edges or at access points leading into valleys were fortified in the LBA and into the Iron I (Zertal sites 23, 26, 95, 97, 137). Only two settlements in southern Site plan of Giloh shows a tower at its northern edge as well as a perimeter wall which encircled an area of approximately .6 ha. A pillared house stands within this enclosed area. Plan courtesy of A. Mazar. Manasseh may have been fortified in the Iron I. They are the strategically located 3.0 ha site of Jabac (Zertal no. 125) and the 2.2 ha site of Khirbet Qumy (Zertal no. 193), situated along a valley margin on the road leading to Shechem. Further south, the hilltop or ridge location of most sites in Ephraim and northern Judah provided the natural strate- gic advantage of a commanding height and view. Giloh provides the single example of a site with a defensive wall and tower (cf. Judg 8:17; 9:46-49, 50-52). While Khirbet ed- Dawwara preserves a hint of fortifications with some domestic structures abutting a wall, CAi and Tell en-Nasbeh were both planned with an outer ring of contiguous houses forming a border, perhaps designed to keep animals in as much as invaders out. The inhabitants of Tell en-Nasbeh inexplicably built silos outside the settlement perimeter. Twelfth to tenth century fortifications were limited in number and scope. Reigning peace would have precluded the need for defensive walls, but Judges 5 describes a some- what unstable situation with bandits roaming the roads. Settlements built along valley perimeters, particularly at access points into the valleys, were particularly vulnerable and so were more likely to be fortified. Hilltop and ridge locations precluded the need for fortifications as the ter- rain provided natural defenses. The typical hill country residence at newly-founded Iron I sites was the "pillared" or "four-room" house, a square to rectangular house with a rear broadroom and a front courtyard divided by one or two rows of pillars (1.1-1.8 m high) to demarcate side rooms (see Holladay 1992 and ref- erences therein).

The animals were secure at night, and radiated heat to warm the house during the cold winter months. Iron II lit- erary and archaeological evidence suggest at least a partial second story for living and sleeping space. The width of the stone foundation walls, the diameter and regular spac- ing of the pillars, and the stone stairs preserved in some Iron II houses (Beersheba, Tell Beit Mirsim, Tell en-Nasbeh) support such a reconstruction. Stager has described the utility of these domestic build- ings. "The pillared house...," he writes, ...was first and foremost a successful adaptation to farm life: the ground floor had space allocated for food pro- cessing, small craft production, stabling, and storage; the second floor (Caliyah) was suitable for dining, sleeping, and other activities... Its longevity attests to its contin- uing suitability not only to the environment, especially where timber was available, but also to the socioeconomic unity housed in it-for the most part, rural families who farmed and raised livestock (1985:17). Pillared buildings, constructed both individually and in compounds, served as dwellings for nuclear and extended families. The interior ground floor space of pillared houses at cAi and Raddana ranged from 42-80 m2. Estimating 10 m2 of roofed space per person, the structures would have housed 4-8 people, though more people are possible with addi- tional second storey space. These low estimates are corroborated by modern-period censi of hill country Arab villages which found households averaged 3.6 (1871) and 4.4 (1920s) family members (Finkelstein 1988b:268-69 fn. 22). Some housing units were configured to create shared central courtyards for extended family social and subsistence purposes. Such units may be the archaeological expression of the bet 'ab (Stager 1985), a socially and economically integrated extended family, consisting of three to four generations (cf. the incest taboos and the pun- ishment of future generations [Lev 18-20; Exod 20:5].) Structures at sites with LBA to Iron I continuity contrasted sharply with the new Iron I highland pillared houses. Wall foundations of buildings at Tell Beit Mirsim, Beth Shemesh, Bethel, and Tell el-Fareah (N) delineated structures ranging in size from 100-200 m2, more than double the size of the CAi and Raddana dwellings. The Tell el-FarCah (N), Beth-Shemesh, and Tell Beit Mirsim structures were square and lacked pil- lars. Monumental buildings, such as the one from Beth-Shemesh, were unparalleled in the central highlands. In general, the newly founded Iron I hamlets appear to have been self-sustaining, dispersed settlements subsisting on a mixed economy of small-scale farming, herding, and stock breeding. As a result of variations in topography and geology, the subsistence base and economy of settlements varied from north to south. In Manasseh and northern Ephraim, where towns and villages clustered along valley perimeter roads and access points, a redistributive economy may have functioned with large, strategically placed sites moving crop surpluses out of the valleys. Iczbet Sartah is one example of a site with a silo capacity greater than estimated settlement needs. Accordingly, it has been interpreted as a collection point for highland grain to be sold or bartered to lowland populations (Finkelstein 1988b:76-77). Further south, terracing at cAi and Raddanah in con- junction with valley dry farming indicates Iron I highland horticulture and cereal cultivation as part of a mixed sub- sistence base. Wheat and barley predominated. The primacy of cereals is indicated by the numbers of storage silos, car- bonized seeds, flint sickle segments, querns, and grinding stones. In addition, residents cultivated olive, grape, almond, pomegranate, fig, and wild-pear. Trees probably occupied a marginal place in the subsistence economy given the limited number of installations used for converting their yield into secondary products such as wine and oil (Rosen 1994). In fact, surveys identified only two sites with olive presses in Ephraim, and both may date to Iron II (Finkelstein 1988b:165, 171). While rocky, sloping terrain is not well-suited to grain cultivation, the large number of rock-cut and stone- Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 75 O I C I? r o</page><page sequence="15">lined pits and silos in conjunction with reaping and pro- cessing implements testify to self-sufficient, highland settlers who processed and stored grain. In addition to their agricultural work, Iron I highland set- tlers raised sheep, goats, and cattle. Animals spent the night in stables on the ground floor of pillared houses and in adja- cent pens (Giloh, cAi?). Sheep and goat were attested in the greatest numbers, followed by cattle. Since sheep and goats better convert cereals into meat, milk, fiber, and leather, settlers probably kept cattle primarily as draught animals (Rosen 1994). Iron I highland settlements produced little evidence of craft specialization, with the exception of the bronze work- shops at cAi and Beth Shemesh. The Bible describes men engaged in construction, metallurgy, and heavy farming tasks, while light farming, food preparation, cooking, spin- ning, and weaving were the women's domain (Exod 35:25-26; 1 Sam 8:11-13; Meyers 1988:139-49). Excavations have iden- tified no reciprocal trade items and few ceramic imports or luxury items. Pottery was largely utilitarian, limited pri- marily to storejars and cooking pots. This restricted repertoire, with minor variations in vessel shape and rim profiles, a vir- tual lack of decoration, and an absence of import imitations probably indicates local production. Overall, numerous factors including isolation, rugged terrain, and few indications of domestic comforts create the impression of Iron I settlers as subsistence farmers and herders on the rocky hillsides. However, rare imported vessels, metallurgical specialization at select sites, twenty- three inscribed arrowheads,5 and seven inscriptions testify to the presence of some relatively wealthy and literate individuals and families. Prior to the establishment of the United Monarchy, the Bible describes a period of shifting alliances among tribes administered by "judges." While judges conducted military campaigns, literary traditions mention no construction pro- jects, standing armies, or large-scale undertakings in conjunction with their position. This picture of regional affiliations within borders corresponding to topographic regions, along with the lack of monumental constructions, correlates well with the archaeological evidence. However, "tribal " affiliation remains archaeologically elusive. The only archaeologically identified cult sites are two mountaintop shrines in the northern territory of Man- asseh: Mt. Ebal, north of Shechem, and the Bull Site in the hills near Dothan. Both are presumed to be Israelite, based on their location in biblical Israelite territory. Later biblical tradition identifies Mt. Ebal as the site where Joshua built an altar (Deut. 11:29; 27:4-8; Josh 8:30-32). On an extension of the northeast slope of Mt. Ebal, a stone wall enclosed a circular altar approximately two meters in diameter. It was later covered by an 8 x 9 m rectangular altar with massive outer walls and two adjacent, rectangular, stone- paved rooms. The fill of the rectangular structure-presumably taken from the earlier circular altar-contained ashes from trees and burned bones of bulls, sheep, goats and young male 0 meters 5 The late eleventh-early tenth century plan of Clzbet Sartah reflects its inhabitants' shift to more intensive cultivation.

This superimposition may indicate an earlier "Canaan- ite " altar superceded by an "Israelite " altar. There is no archaeological evidence that the altar functioned as a supra- tribal Israelite cult center despite the biblical attestation (Zertal 1986; cf. Kempinski 1986 for the suggestion that this struc- ture was a defensive tower similar to one from Giloh). The early to mid-twelfth century open-air "Bull Site" situated on the summit of a high ridge, may exemplify a biblical "high place " (1 Kgs 14:23). A stone circle approxi- mately 20 m in diameter enclosed a sacred area containing a "standing stone" with "offerings " on an associated stone pave- ment, an 18 cm long bronze statuette of a bull, a fragment of a ceramic incense burner or model shrine, cooking pots and bowls, animal bones, and flints. As an emblem animal, the bull may represent Baal, El, or Yahweh. The story of Gideon in Judges 6 describes the worship of Baal by Canaanites and Israelites living in the vicinity of the Bull Shrine. However, given the site location within biblically defined Israelite ter- ritory and the bull calves erected by Jeroboam I in the temples at Dan and Bethel (1 Kgs 12:28), this bull may well have rep- resented Yahweh (Mazar 1982:26-37; 1990:350-52; see Coogan 1987 and Ahlstrom 1990 for alternative interpretations). Rather than presenting a dramatic break with earlier "Canaanite" cultic practices, the earliest "Israelite" cult sites demonstrate continuity with indigenous practices. The Israelite 76 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="16">&lt; The Bull Site is one of the two archaeologically identified cult places in the northern territory of Manasseh. An early to mid-twelfth century open-air summit site, the Bull Site takes its name from a diminutive bronze statuette of a bull unearthed on a pavement enclosed within a circle of stones and sporting a "standing stone." Whatever the ethnic identity of the worshippers at this site, their religious material culture does not represent a break with "Canaanite" cultic practices. Top plan courtesy of A. Mazar. 4 A This 18-cm-long bronze bull statuette possesses obvious continuities with both MBA and LBA religious practices. The bull could equally be the emblem of Canaanite Baal or Israelite Yahweh.

Ebal altar incorporated earlier sacrificial remains into the construction of the new altar built directly on top of the previous one. "Standing stones" and bull figurines such as those found at the Bull Site were features of the indigenous MBA and LBA cult. Refraining from pig consumption is a possible Israelite ethnic marker and cultic taboo (Lev 11:7; Deut 14:8; Isa 65:4, 66:3, 17; Hesse 1990). The absence of pig bones distinguishes the Iron I highland population from its coastal, Shephelah, and Transjordanian neighbors. The Late Bronze-Iron Age I Canaanite Fortress Temple 1 at Shechem has been identified with the Temple of Baal- berith/El-berith destroyed by Abimelech and his supporters (udg 9:4,27,46-49; Toombs and Wright 1963:29; Stager n.d.). This large Canaanite sanctuary was originally constructed in the LBA and destroyed around 1100 BCE (Toombs 1979:73). Its impressive scale stands in contrast to contemporary and rather modest Israelite places of worship. Cave and bench tombs, both utilized in LBII Canaan, were the exclusive Iron I burial types in the highlands from Dothan south to Hebron and in the Shephelah (Bloch-Smith 1992:167-77, fig. 16). The tomb was the eternal residence for nuclear and, sometimes, extended family members. As such, each tomb's architectural plan, its attired bodies, and its many mortuary goods (including ceramic vessels, food, jewelry, and personal items such as seals, tools, and figurines) pre- serve a microcosm of daily life (see Bloch-Smith 1992 for an extended treatment). Population estimates for the central highlands vary considerably. Given the difficulty of estimating built and roofed living space necessary to calculate an ethnographic- derived estimate of one person per every 10 m2 (Naroll 1962), Broshi and Gophna (1984) proposed 25 persons per 100 m2 settlement area. Estimates range from 40,650-60,000 for the settled population west of the Jordan River by late Iron I (Finkelstein 1988b:332-34; Mazar 1990:337). Epigraphic Evidence of Early "Israel" Pharaoh Merneptah's "Hymn of Victory" provides the first extra-biblical mention of Israel. This poem attests to the existence of a people "Israel " by the end of the thirteenth century. Israel is mentioned along with the cities of Ashkelon, Gezer, and Yanoam, but its geographic location is uncer- tain (Na'aman 1994:247-49). Perhaps Merneptah's Israelites were the El worshippers mentioned in the Jacob/Israel stories near the Jabbok River (Wadi Zerqa) in Transjordan and in the highlands of southern Manasseh and Ephraim (Gen 32:23-29; 33:18-20; 35:6-10), i.e., the Iron I settlers iden- tified in archaeological surveys and excavations in the central highlands and the Jordan Valley/central Transjordan (see below). The extent and the political and religious structures of Merneptah's "Israel" remain uncertain. Yet, from the beginning of the Iron I, the northern part of the central high- lands underwent a dramatic increase in settlement. In many ways, these highland settlements resembled those of the low- lands (see below), but were distinguished by the absence of pig, reliance on collared-rim pithoi, and relatively small Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 77 5'" 0, 'L9' \ C1 a ?;)Q.~ ,i( 0~ %-r ( '* .... v) , . . .

Settlers abandoned numerous settlements and entire regions in Manasseh, Ephraim, Ammon, Judah, and the Shephelah during the late twelfth and eleventh cen- turies, including in the Shechem region, cAi, Raddanna, Tell en-Nasbeh, and Tell Beit Mirsim. Neither the Bible nor archaeology describe or explain the demise of the highland settlements, although incipient urbanism may have been a factor. This widespread abandonment throws into ques- tion the relationship of Iron I early Israel and Iron II monarchic Israel. The Galilee The mountainous Galilee is the northernmost geographic region in Israel. Geological divisions between its northern and southern regions have led to differences in settlement patterns. The rugged and heavily forested Upper Galilee is a high plateau ranging from 1000 m in the south to 500m in the north, where it reaches the Lebanese Litani River Valley. The Lower Galilee is transsected by four east-west mountain ranges, their peaks reaching no higher than 600 m. Three wide intermontane valleys separate these ranges, providing fertile farmland and facilitating communication. The Jezreel Valley marks the southern extent of the Galilee. This broad valley, open to the east and west, allows for easy passage from the coastal plain to the Beth-Shean and Jordan River Valleys, and onward into Jordan and Syria. Upper Galilee Biblical passages which refer to the Upper Galilee in the Iron I include the stories of the battle of the waters of Merom and the destruction of Hazor (Josh 11), the tribe of Dan's migration north to the city of Laish (osh 19:40-48; Judg 1:34; 18), the story of Deborah Judg 4-5), and the list of uncon- quered Canaanite cities in Judg 1:27-34. Descriptions of tribal allotments (Josh 13-19) suggest traditional demarcations to Naphtali and Asher following the lines of the Galilean intermontane valleys (Frankel 1994:21-22). However, the list of unconquered cities in Judg 1:21, 27-35-borrowed from the tribal allotments noted in Joshua-probably reflects the later reality of the tenth century BCE (Na'aman 1994:268). Contemporary understanding of the occupation of the Upper Galilee began in the 1950s, with Aharoni's ground- breaking survey. Since that time, excavations at major sites such as Hazor (Y. Yadin; A. Ben-Tor), Dan (A. Biran), Acco (M. Dothan), Tel Keisan (J. Briend and J.B. Humbert), and Kabri (A. Kempinski, et al.), and a series of regional surveys and small-scale excavations (R. Frankel; Z. Gal; M. Aviam noted in Frankel 1994:fn. 34) have vastly expanded our under- standing of that region in the Iron I. Iron I settlement in the Upper Galilee reflected LBA set- tlement patterns. The eastern Galilee boasted 40 mostly new Iron I sites. These small (.2 to 2.0 ha) sites clustered in regional pockets rather than spreading out evenly across the land- scape. In this way, they retained the regionalism of the LBA. Their ceramic assemblages were commonly limited to pithoi, cooking pots, and small kraters (Frankel 1994:25-26). They were founded at the very end of the twelfth century or, more Pharaoh Merneptah's victory stele contains the first extra-biblical fI' ;^' mention of the people "Israel," but the location and structure of this "Israel" remain uncertain.

Sur- veyors found no sites between this region and that of Aharoni's survey in the eastern sector of the Upper Galilee. Tyre of the Iron I remains unknown (Ward 1994:75). How- ever, a string of settlements close to the modern Lebanese border, all containing Tyrian ceramic vessels, may reflect the southern borders of that Iron I city-state. These sites included the large city of Tel Rosh, perhaps to be identified with Beth- Anath (Josh 19:38), as well as the fortress at Har Adir and the sites of Horvat CAvot and Kibbutz Sasa (Frankel 1994:32-33). Somewhat farther south, the fortresses at Har Meron and Har Canaan may be linked to new Iron I settlement in the Upper Galilee. Not far from Hazor, they and their neigh- boring sites belonged to the territory of the tribe of Naphtali (Josh 20:7). The pithoi found at these sites were typically of the Galilean type (Frankel 1994:32-33). Tel Kabri, possibly ancient Rehob (Josh 19:28), had been an important city within the territory of LBA Acco, to its southwest. Its Iron Age I occu- pation is not well known (Gal 1992:61; 1994:38; Kempinski 1993a). Both Kabri and nearby Har Hagamal, overlooking the Acco Plain, ultimately fell within the purview of the tribe of Asher. Among the Bronze Age city-states of the Upper Galilee, Hazor had been the most significant. Its disproportionately large size (80 ha) underscores its importance and its title, "head of all those kingdoms " (Josh 11:10), yet, its authority 78 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="18">The Iron I village of Hazor, Str.

Nineteenth and Twenti- eth Dynasty Egyptian military campaigns reached for its territory from the south (Frankel 1994:20-21), while Acco, on the Mediterranean coast, stood as a foil on Hazor's western border, and coastal Tyre checked the northernmost extent of its power (Gal 1994:38). In archaeological scholarship, the thirteenth-century destruction of LB IIB Hazor (Str. XIII=1A) ordinarily marks the transition from Canaanite to Israelite culture in the Upper Galilee. Originally dated by Yadin to the mid-thirteenth cen- tury, a more recent investigation has shown that the Str. XIII destruction may have taken place in the first third of that century (Beck and Kochavi 1985). The Hazor destruction has been linked to Israelite tribes (osh 11:10; so Yadin 1979), or, along with Acco, to the Egyptian army that wished to elim- inate a potentially troublesome competitor in the north (Kochavi cited in Singer 1994:309, fn. 2), or even to competing Canaan- ite city-states (Frankel 1994:32-34). According to the current excavator of the site, Amnon Ben-Tor (1997a:4) the precise date and cause of the destruction remain uncertain. In consequence, the question of whether the founding of other Galilean villages pre- (Aharoni 1957a:150) or post- (Yadin 1972:131-32) dated the Iron I settlement that followed Hazor's thirteenth-century demise is problematic. It is likely that Canaanites fleeing the destruction of their long-time urban homes settled at least some of these villages regard- less of who put the torch to Hazor (Frankel 1994:32). The limited number of excavated sites in the region exacer- bates the difficulty of establishing a precise chronological sequence for the founding of the Iron I villages of the Upper Galilee. The village of Hazor Str. XII (limited to the acropolis) con- sisted of a small, impoverished settlement typified by silos, hearths, and the foundations of simple huts. Its pottery resembles that at other twelfth century sites in the Upper Galilee and includes Galilean and Tyrian pithoi. Alternately, pastoralists-rather than villagers in a settled community- may have made use of the rounded enclosures and storage facilities at Iron I Hazor (Hopkins 1993:210). Here, as at Dan, the many silos at the site may indicate the capacity for agricultural surplus (Meyers 1983:52). Later in the Iron I, an unwalled village appeared (Str. XI). Nothing found in Str. XII-XI indicates that Hazor's inhabi- tants were now Israelite, but because of the detailed conquest story in Joshua 11 and the scale of the LB IIB destruction, LB IIB historians commonly assume this. They find support in the lengthy gap following Str. XIII, the complete change in settlement strategy in Str. XII, and the occupational conti- nuity between Str. XII and Str. XI (Yadin 1972:134; Beck 1989:361). In the mid-tenth century (Str. X), Hazor became a strategically important Israelite city, as Solomon made it one of his administrative centers and reshaped it with massive construction projects (1 Kgs 9:15). It may have been at this point that its earlier, memorable destruction came to be attributed to the more recent Israelite inhabitants. The simple mid-eleventh century Israelite village at Hazor (Str. XI) contained a small sanctuary, Room 3283. It was a 5 x 4 m room with benches along its southern end. An offer- ing deposit filled with bronze votive objects buried under the floor highlighted its sacred function. The deposit con- tained a bronze figure of a seated male wearing a cone-like helmet and holding a weapon in his left hand. This fig- urine likely originated in one of Hazor's magnificent LBA temples and was reused in this eleventh century village. Room 3283 and environs also produced incense stands, votive arrowheads, metal weapons, and other precious objects, while a row of four stone pillars border a paved area to its west (Beck 1989:358-62; Yadin 1972:132-33, fig. 29; Yadin 1975:257). Given our limited archaeological evidence for religious obser- vance in the Iron I, it is not possible to characterize this cultic center as either Israelite or "other." LBA Tel Dan (Tell el-Qadi), home to the thriving Canaan- ite city of Laish, met its end late in the thirteenth century (Str. VIIB). Its subsequent occupation has been attributed to the tribe of Dan, whose wanderings, victory over the Canaanite inhabitants of Laish, and occupation of the renamed site of Dan are described in the books of Joshua (19:40-48) and Judges (1:34; 18). The length of the gap between LB IIB Dan Str. VIIB and Iron I Dan Str. VI is unclear. Given the 100-150 year gap between LB IIB Hazor (Str. XIII) and Iron I Hazor (Str. XII), and the similarity between Hazor (XII-XI) and Dan (VI-V) in the Iron I, a similar gap between Dan's LB IIB and Iron I makes sense (Nacaman 1994:272). Traces of walls and floors and the many deep storage pits found in clusters throughout the site characterized Iron I Dan (Str. VI). Excavations found pithoi of the Galilean and col- lared-rim types, as well as many large kraters and cooking pots. Foreign imports, common in LB Laish, disappeared. The absence of significant architecture, the prevalence of sheep and goat bones, and the many silos and large storage vessels Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 79</page><page sequence="19">~is led the excavator to conclude that the population of Dan Str. VI was transhumant (Biran 1994:126-35). The fact that Dan's collared-rim jars are far north of their normal range- fabricated (for the most part) in the south-suggests to scholars that the residents of Dan Str. VI were southerners, just as posited by the narrative in Judges 18 (Biran 1994:129-32). The biblical story of Micah's idol and the tribe of Dan cul- minates with the Danite conquest of Laish and the establishment of a cultic center there (Judg 18:27-31). While no remains of that cultic center, said to include an idol (pesel) and a Mosaic priest, have been found in Dan's sacred precinct, it is not impossible that Dan did contain an Iron I sanctuary, one which Jeroboam capitalized upon several centuries later (1 Kgs 12:28-29). This notwithstanding, given the polemical and satirical nature of the Judg 17-18 narrative, it is unlikely that the story should be construed as descriptive of an actual historical episode (so Nacaman 1994:270-71). Later in the Iron I, settlers built a village of stone houses (Str. V). While some elements in the abundant ceramic assemblage indicate continuity from Str. VI to Str. V, the A Aerial view of Dan (Tell el-Qadi). The LBA Canaanite city at this site was known as Laish, and it suffered destruction in the late thirteenth century.

Collared-rim store jars are much more commonly found in the highlands to the south. Some scholars have connected the presence of these "southern" pithoi at the northern site of Dan with the biblical story of the migration of the tribe.

Tyrian pithoi and Philistine bichrome ware suggest increasingly wide-ranging contacts for the local inhabitants. Fire destroyed Str. V in the mid-eleventh century (Biran 1993:326-67; Biran 1994:135-42). The Storejars of the Upper Galilee The storejars of the Iron I have been the subject of a great deal of scholarly discussion. The collared-rim jars of the north, especially at Dan, have been identified as those used by the first Israelites to occupy the Galilee. These early set- tlers brought at least some of the storejars with them from the south (Biran 1989). Albright considered the collared-rim store- jars an indicator of Israelite presence at any number of sites (1960), and others have identified the storejars of the north, especially those at Dan, as part of the equipment brought from the south by some of the earlier Israelite settlers. More recently, 80 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="20">scholars have seen the storejars as testimony to agricultural subsistence and unique storage needs (Finkelstein 1988b; Lon- don 1989). The Galilean and Tyrian pithoi typical of the Iron Age I in the Upper Galilee differ from the collared-rim storejars more commonly found in the hill country to the south. Their antecedents, and those of the cooking pots, can be found at LBA sites such as Hazor and Tyre, underscoring the conti- nuity of ceramic traditions in the Upper Galilee and reflecting the enduring importance of regional cultural differences (Frankel 1994:27-29; Esse 1991). The Upper Galilee: Summary The Upper Galilee of the Iron I can be characterized by the presence of small newly-founded highland villages clus- tered into regional components that reflect the earlier influence of important LBA city-states (Tyre, Acco, and Hazor) and the later configuration of the Israelite tribes (Frankel 1994). At those large cities of the LBA which underwent massive destruc- tion sometime during the thirteenth century (Dan and Hazor), the initial Iron I settlement was significantly more tenta- tive than its later Iron I successor. Due to the breakdown of the LBA trade networks, the loss of foreign suppliers, and the simplicity of life in these agricultural villages, eco- nomic self-sufficiency prevailed. Exceptions to this include imported collared-rim storejars (Biran 1994:132) and some Philistine pottery at Dan. Overall, contacts were regional, reflecting residual LBA territorial patterns (Frankel 1994:29). In later biblical tradition, the Upper Galilee became the tribal allotment of the originally southern tribe of Dan (Josh 19:40-48; Judg 18), of Asher (Josh 19:24-31), and of Naphtali (Josh 19:32-39). However, the continuity of Tyr- ian and Galilean ceramic traditions from LBA II to Iron I demonstrates the enduring presence of indigenous north- erners in the Upper Galilee and contradicts the notion that the inhabitants of this region moved here from southern homes. The destructions of major cities such as Hazor and Dan indicate turmoil in the region, but there are many pos- sible sources for that turmoil. Pastoralists (shasu, Capiru and others), long noted as troublesome to the citydwellers, may have created problems, although they were probably incapable of razing a heavily defended walled city. Pressures created by the settlement of the Sea Peoples along the coast may have caused shifts in the political stability of life further inland. Various groups from Anatolia and Syria moved south at this time as well. Urban Canaanites may have been on the move, attempting to expand territory or destroy enemies. Perceived threats to Egyptian stability may have met with military responses. Where precisely the southern groups biblically identified as Dan, Asher, and Naphtali fit in remains unclear. The pres- ence of a southern pottery form, the collared-rim storejar, at Dan indicates that the Danites did indeed move from the south to this most northern of Galilee sites. The Bible sug- gests that members of the other two tribes also settled in the Upper Galilee, but that cannot be substantiated archaeolog- ically. The majority of residents in the region were old-time Galileans who were either shifting from pastoralism to farm- ing or fleeing the destruction of the major cities of the region. Dan aside, the Iron I settlement pattern of the Upper Galilee, and the biblical tribal demarcations noted in Joshua 19, reflect traditional LBA settlement patterns and populations (Frankel 1994:29-34). Lower Galilee The Bible recounts epic battles between Israelites and Canaanites in the Galilee. The historicity of Joshua's victo- ries at the Waters of Merom (Josh 11:1-9) and at Hazor (Josh 11:10-15), and Deborah and Barak's victory at Mt. Tabor (Judg 4-5) is much-debated (NaCaman 1994:257-58). Nonethe- less, this militant epoch may belong to the first half of the eleventh century, suggesting that Philistines joined Canaan- ites in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to prevent an Israelite takeover of the northern valleys (Singer 1994:318-22). How- ever, given the uncertainty about the historicity of the Galilean battle(s), efforts to match the Joshua 11 and Judges 4-5 nar- ratives with archaeological data are misplaced. A mix of urban sites (Hannaton, Tel Rekhesh), towns or villages (Tel Yincam, Tell el-Wawiyat, Tell 'Ein Zippori), and a fortress (Tel Qarnei Hittin) represent the limited set- tlement of the LBA Lower Galilee. These settlements, all located in the southern part of the Lower Galilee, likely relate to the flourishing LBA occupation of the Jezreel Valley and the Plain of Acco (Gal 1988). Thirteenth-century destructions or abandonments ended the Canaanite occupation at some (Tel Qarnei Hittin, Hannaton; Gal 1994:36-39), while oth- ers (Tell cEin Zippori, Tell el-Wawiyat) were inhabited throughout the twelfth century and even later (Dessel 1999). Surveys of the Lower Galilee indicate some two dozen Iron I settlements, either with prior inhabitation or founded anew, primarily in the twelfth century. Most were located in its southwestern part, i.e., the Beth Netofah Valley and the Nazareth Hills. Iron I occupation in the northern and east- ern Lower Galilee was more limited. The contours of the settlement pattern relate to the fate of Lower Galilee's major LBA sites. In areas near sites destroyed late in the thirteenth- century, small-scale settlement resumed a half-century or so later. Closer to the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys, where Egypto-Canaanite sites experienced continuous occupation from the LBA into the eleventh century, new sites were not established in the Iron I (Gal 1994). With few exceptions, then, settlement in the eastern Lower Galilee did not resume until the period of the Israelite monar- chy. The strategically located fortress of Tel Qamei Hittin was destroyed in the mid-thirteenth century; excavators found only a single pit dating to the Iron I. The major LBA site in this region was at Tel Rekhesh. Its destruction may have taken place in the twelfth century (Gal 1992:87-91), in conjunction with the Egyptian loss of control over the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys. Tel Yincam in the Yavne'el Valley was destroyed late in the thirteenth century. Occupation there soon resumed. A series of architectural phases demonstrating continuity from the twelfth through the tenth centuries characterize its Iron I settlement (Liebowitz 1981; 1993).

V The Jezreel Valley offered the only east- west passage through the highland backbone of the Southern Levant. The valley's copious level land and strategic significance attracted extensive Egyptian- sponsored settlement during the LBA. Numerous prominent sites ring the valley. Photograph by R. Cleave. Tell el-Wawiyat is located in the Beth Netofah Valley. In the LBA, several sub- stantial buildings dominated this well-to-do settlement. The buildings and pottery of the twelfth century indi- cate close continuity with their LBA predecessors. Throughout the twelfth century, Wawiyat may have continued to serve an elite function, evidently redis- tributive rather than agricultural. The absence of a destruction layer suggests that the site was abandoned rather than destroyed. Its inhabitants likely left in response to the weakened socio-eco- nomic state of nearby sites, including (presumably) Tel Hannaton and sites along the Mediterranean coast and in the Jezreel Valley. Later in the Iron I (eleventh century), a group of squatters reoccupied the earlier settlement, con- structing simple homes within the still extant larger structures (Dessel, Nakhai, and Wisthoff 1993:1500-01). The village of Tell CEin-Zippori, located along the Nahal Zippori, contained a large building complex. Like Tell el-Wawiyat, pottery included imported and local wares, and Zippori was continuously settled from the LBA II into the Iron I (Dessel 1997:227-28). Its destruction in the mid-tenth century may be related to the growth of the Israelite monar- chy, as its traditional and well-functioning elite may have posed a threat to the government in Jerusalem (Dessel 1999). The Storejars of the Lower Galilee Storejars from northern Lower Galilean sites, the biblical territory of Naphtali (Josh 19:32-39), include only Galilean pithoi. Those from southern sites, the territory later allocated to the tribes of Zebulun (Josh 19:10-16) and Issachar (Josh 19:17-23), reveal a mix of Galilean and collared-rim storejars (Gal 1992:79, 84; 1994:41). As in the Upper Galilee, the mix (or lack thereof) of storejars in the Lower Galilee may indi- cate different regional or social ties, ties apparent to later Israelite administrators and biblical writers. Subsistence in the Lower Galilee Most Iron I sites in the Lower Galilee were villages located near springs or along the Nahal Zippori. Farming was pos- sible, once settlers cleared the land of forests. However, the rocky nature of the northern Lower Galilee precluded an economy based solely upon agriculture. Thus, residents com- bined animal husbandry with small-scale dry farming (Gal 1992:86; 1994:42). 82 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="22">At some sites, the isolation of the villages and the lack of imported ceramics or other goods indicate local self-suffi- ciency. At others, in particular those sites with occupational continuity from the LBA II into the Iron I (Tel CEin Zippori, Tell el-Wawiyat), social complexity and more wide-rang- ing contacts are apparent (Dessel 1999). The Lower Galilee: Summary Varied occupational strategies characterize the Lower Galilee during the Iron I. As in the Upper Galilee, the num- ber of occupied sites was limited. Some continued from the LBA and demonstrate that the complex culture of Bronze Age Canaan, as supported and encouraged by Egyptian lead- ership, persisted well into the Iron I. The presence of these multi-period sites suggests as well the ways in which village life, as apart from the urban experience, was critical to cul- tural continuity (Dessel 1999). New sites were founded in the Lower Galilee, most com- monly in the twelfth century, a half-century and more after the destructions of the major Galilean cities of Hazor and Hannaton and the fortress at Tel Qarnei Hittin. These new sites were villages in which the inhabitants supported them- selves by farming and raising livestock. They existed predominantly in the southern and southwestern part of the region. In the eastern Lower Galilee, closer to the still- thriving world of the Egypto-Canaanite Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys, the Iron I welcomed no new settlements. Rather, their inception waited until the tenth century and the growth of the Israelite monarchy (Gal 1994:42). The chronological gap at many sites between LBA II destruction and Iron I resettlement, the addition of new ceramic forms, and the changes between the LBA and Iron I settlement patterns suggest that the Iron I settlers were not directly related to their Canaanite predecessors. The biblical narrative claims that the Zebulun clans settled in the south and the Naphtali clans in the north. Both Zebulun and Naph- tali played critical roles in the battle between Israelites and Canaanites for the Galilee (Judg 4-5). In the Mt. Tabor nar- rative, we catch a glimpse of the dynamics between the Canaanites of the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys and the Israelites of the Lower Galilee, early in the Iron I. One result of this conflict was that Israelite settlement in the eastern Lower Galilee did not commence until the tenth century. Early in the United Monarchy, the tribe of Issachar settled the region, according to the Bible (Gal 1994:43-45). The Jezreel Valley and the Beth-Shean Valley The Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys were critically impor- tant in antiquity because together they provided the only east-west passage across the north of Israel, connecting the coastal highway with the Jordan River Valley, the major inland route for north-south travel.6 The Jezreel Valley, some nine- teen miles long, lies between the mountains of the Lower Galilee and those of the central highlands. The rich alluvial soil of the Jezreel Valley and its plentiful annual rainfall made it ideal for farming, and it was one of the most fertile agri- cultural regions in southern Canaan. The Beth-Shean Valley, to which the Jezreel connects at its eastern end, is geographically part of the Jordan River Valley; in antiquity, however, its set- tlement was related to that of the Jezreel. Many Bronze Age Canaanite sites, both large and small, found homes in both these valleys. To control both routes and resources, Egyptian authori- ties asserted their strength in this region early in the LBA and retained control well into the twelfth century BCE. An Egypt- ian presence is especially evident at the Egypto-Canaanite administrative centers of Megiddo and Beth-Shean. As the cities and towns of the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys expe- rienced the cultural transition into the Iron I, those sites allied with Egypt generally survived intact longer than did others (Gal 1994:38-39). While Rameses III (1184-1153 BCE) was the last of the pharaohs to dominate Canaan, Egyptian control lingered in some areas, including the site of Megiddo, as late as the reign of Rameses VI or even a few more decades (Singer 1994:293-94). With the collapse of Egyptian authority near the end of the twelfth century BCE, there was a general decline in the quality of life in the northern valleys. Economic weakness, the loss of trade, and the absence of a viable political infra- structure all contributed. A new population took control of once-Canaanite cities and Egypto-Canaanite strategic strong- holds. The new demographic blend may have included Canaanites, Philistines, and other Sea Peoples, as well as some Hittites, Hivites, Jebusites, Girgashites, and Perrizites. Lasting until late in the eleventh century BCE, the settlement of these newcomers was facilitated by the Jordan River Valley's importance as a route for people seeking relief from famine and other hardships at the end of the LBA. Although difficult to document archaeologically, the intensity of the twelfth century migrations suggests an Anatolian or Syr- ian presence at many sites ( Naaman 1994:241-46; Beck 1994). Collared-rim jar burials at a number of sites, in the Jezreel Valley and elsewhere, (Sahab, Kfar Yehoshua, Megiddo, Azor, Tel Zeror, and Tell es-Sacidiyeh) may likewise be linked to cultural precedents in Anatolia (Ji 1995:137). In general, the material culture in these post-Egyptian settlements was poor, especially compared to its richness during the era of Egyptian control. The impoverished Megiddo VIB, founded on the ruins of the rich city of Egypto-Canaan- ite VIIA, exemplifies this decline. Due to their strategic importance, however, they often quickly regained some degree of affluence, as their newly mixed populations asserted their own strength (Singer 1994:309, 318-22). While the biblical understanding of the process by which Israelites came to control the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys is confused (cf. Judg 6:33-7:23 with Josh 17:11-12 and Judg 1:27), archaeologists agree that the shift in settlement did not happen until the beginning of the tenth century, founded on David's eleventh century conquest of Megiddo VIA (Finkel- stein 1988b:93). Jezreel Valley and Beth-Shean Valley Sites Jokneam guarded the major westernmost pass into the Jezreel Valley as well as the north-south coastal road. Its LBA settlement ended with a major destruction in the Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 83</page><page sequence="23">late thirteenth-early twelfth century. ^ ;^. .i. Despite a gap in settlement between the LBA II and Iron I, inhabitants con- structed the buildings of the first two phases (Str. XVIIIA-B) of the unforti- fied Iron I settlement in alignment with the LBA plan. The pottery of the Iron I showed continuity with LBA forms, but also included Phoenecian imports and Philistine pottery typical of the coastal plain and inland areas. The rejuvenation of Jokneam in the eleventh century may be attributed to the positive relationship between Philistines and Canaanites as together they strove to prevent Israelite access to the Via Maris (Ben-Tor cited in Singer 1994:319, fn. 207). During this third Iron I phase (Str. XVII), residents used one building at Jokneam for olive oil pro- duction. Olive oil installations were also found at the nearby villages of Tel Qiri and Tel Qashish. The final destruction of Iron I Jokneam has been attributed to David's conquest of the Jezreel Valley (Ben-Tor 1993a:808-09; 1993b:1203; 1997b:388; 1997c:382). Tel Qiri (Hazorea), a small, unfortified village 2 km south of Tel Yokneam, was a satellite of the larger site. It contained two relatively similar Iron I strata (Str. IX-VIII). In Str. IX, at the beginning of the Iron I, the ceramic assemblage included Philistine wares and collared-rim storejars. A cultic struc- ture-found in Str. VIII and dated to the eleventh century BCE-contained cultic pottery, including an incense burner, a libation vessel, a chalice, a cup-and-saucer, and a votive bowl. It also contained evidence for animal sacrifice, includ- ing the right forelegs of sheep and goat (cf. Lev 7:32-33). The only significant shift in construction at Iron Age Tel Qiri occured between its Iron I and Iron II settlements, when the alignment of its buildings shifted. At this same time, nearby Jokneam and Megiddo, slightly farther away, were destroyed and reoccupied, presumably by the Israelites. The absence at Tel Qiri of any signs of destruction between the Iron I and the Iron II has led excavators to suggest continuity in population in this well-to-do farming village (Ben-Tor 1993c:1228-29; 1997b:387-89). Due to its strategic location, the city of Megiddo con- trolled the Damascus branch of the Via Maris as well as access to the Jezreel Valley. It was unquestionably the most important of the Jezreel Valley cities; indeed, it was among the most important in all of southern Canaan. The wealth of Egyptian materials found at the site-materials that date from Thutmosis III's conquest of the site in the early fifteenth century BCE into the twelfth century-demonstrate its impor- tance to New Kingdom Egypt. Increasingly, Megiddo housed Egyptian administrators and military personnel and served Egypt's imperial agenda; by the end of the LBA, Egypt exer- cised full control over the city (Singer 1988-1989:110-11). Tel Jokneam guarded a pass through the Jezreel Valley as well as the north-south coastal road. It suffered a major destruction at the end of the LBA II. Its reconstruction in Iron I followed the alignment of the previous strata and its ceramic repertoire was in continuity with LBA forms and included Phoenecian and Philistine pottery in keeping with its strategic location on a commercial thoroughfare. The beginnings of the Iron Age at Megiddo are uncer- tain. Str. VIIA is tentatively dated to the twelfth century. Given the presence of imported Cypriote and Mycenean wares, lim- ited Philistine wares and local pottery, however, the stratum may have begun as early as the late thirteenth century (Singer 1988-1989:109-10 and references there). In either case, there is demonstrably little continuity between this occupation and its LBA predecessor (Str. VIIB). For example, the new plan of the reconstructed palace in Area AA retained simi- larities to the previous one but was laid some two meters above it. An extraordinary hoard of LBA ivories, both locally made and imported, turned up in a newly constructed sec- tion of its northern wing. Included among the more than 350 carved pieces was an ivory pen box inscribed with the car- touche of Rameses III (1184-1153). Elsewhere on the site, the population reused the LBA temple (Area BB), as well as some nearby buildings. Residential construction also took place (Ussishkin 1997b:463-64; Yadin 1993:1012-13). The pedestal base of a bronze statue of Rameses VI (1143-1136) suggests the latest extent of Egyptian rule in the region and pro- vides a date of ca. 1130 BCE for the total destruction of Str. VIA (Singer 1994:293-94). At this point, the sequence of occu- pation at Megiddo that began in the Middle Bronze Age (Str. X) finally came to an end (Gonen 1987:96). Later twelfth century occupation (Str. VIB) on the now- unfortified site was of poor quality. Without its thriving Egyptian infrastructure, the population of Megiddo dwin- dled into economic decline. The city's long-used Temple 2048 84 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="24">fell into disrepair (Singer 1994:309). Some archaeologists have used the presence of collared-rim storejars at Megiddo to support the suggestion that Str. VIIA was destroyed by Israelites who then settled the subsequent Str. VIB (Aharoni 1972). However, collared-rim jars cannot be used to sub- stantiate an Israelite presence (Rast 1978:55; Finkelstein 1988b:285; London 1989). This is worth stressing, since Judges 1:27-28 notes that the Canaanites held their ground at Megiddo and other Jezreel Valley sites. Although compelled to serve Israel as forced laborers, they were never driven out of the region. The extensive construction of the next stratum (VIA), dated to the first half of the eleventh century, followed a com- pletely new plan and included a new gateway, domestic neighborhoods, and a single public building. Excavations unearthed luxurious artifacts, including many metal objects, &lt; Lions and winged sphinxes circle around this ivory box (H: 7.5 cm).

Finds of Philistine bichrome ware make it possible that a Philistine presence was responsible for Megiddo's rejuvenation. In this reconstruction-like that of Jokneam- Philistines joined together with Canaan- ites to prevent Israelite access to the Via Maris (Singer 1994:319). Megiddo's cur- rent excavator disagrees, denying a significant Philistine presence in Str. VIA (Ussishkin 1997b:464). A major con- flagration destroyed the stratum. Archaeologists have suggested that it may have been the result of an attack by David and his forces, who then founded Megiddo VA (Shiloh 1993:1016; Ussishkin 1997b:464). Tell Tacannek (biblical Taanach) is located in the Jezreel Valley southeast of Megiddo. Unoccupied for most of the LBA II, the site was settled through- out much of the twelfth century BCE. Iron I pottery manifests continuity with regional LBA precedents (Rast 1978:55). Excavators uncovered substantial houses in the fortified Iron I town. In the twelfth century (Period IA), a courtyard house was constructed, remodeled, and finally abandoned. In Period IB, inhabitants constructed a second home on the same site. This traditionally designated "Drainpipe Structure" consisted of a courtyard with a cis- tern, trough, and basin. Rooms were found on its three sides, and a pillared wall and flagstone paving were also associ- ated with it. Evidently, this building served both domestic and livestock functions. In the public part of the town, one building preserved an alphabetic cuneiform tablet acknowl- edging receipt of a grain shipment (Rast 1978:3-8). Two important ceramic stands used for cultic activities came to light in the context of the later Iron II "Cultic Structure" (Rast 1978:23 and references therein). Ornately decorated with relief and incised decoration, they are both typical of the Iron I (inasmuch as it is an era in which cult Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 85</page><page sequence="25">&lt; The well-known ceramic cult stand from Taanach emerged from the context of a later Iron II "cultic structure," but its iconography places it within Taanach's Iron I cultic paraphernalia.

A recent study of their iconog- raphy-lions, winged sphinxes, trees with goats, figures holding serpents, and a goddess-concludes that these unique ceramic stands may indeed have been part of Taanach's Iron I cultic paraphernalia. They were made locally, but combined Anatolian and north Syrian traditions with those of the Canaanites and Phoenicians.7 Iron I Taanach was substantial in scale and evidenced the presence of an elite group of inhabitants. It was important as a center for trade in agricultural products and contained substantial houses and public buildings. These data suggest that the reinvigoration of Taanach resulted from new invest- ment poured into the Jezreel Valley early in the twelfth century. Given continuing importance in this region, Egypt was surely a partner in this economic boom. The iconographic con- nections of the ceramic stands suggest the continuation of northern interests. Taanach IB was destroyed ca. 1125 BCE and not resettled for a century. The new Iron II town was likely to have been formed under the impetus of the developing Israelite monar- chy (Glock 1993:1432; Rast 1978:55, Table 2). CAfula, east of Megiddo, contained two late twelfth-eleventh century construction phases. In Str. IIIB, the site included a large building consisting of four broadrooms surrounding a courtyard, as well as granaries, a kiln, and a cemetery on the eastern edge of the mound. The pottery continued LBA traditions and contained some Cypriote imports. In Str. IIIA, Philistine ware was found alongside Canaanite pottery. CAfula was destroyed in the second half of the eleventh century and was not reoccupied until the mid-ninth century (M. Dothan 1993a:37-39). Beth-Shean, dominating the easternmost end of the Jezreel Valley as it meets the Jordan Valley, was an Egyptian strong- hold throughout much of the LBA. In the thirteenth century, as Egypt tightened its rule over Canaan, new construction took place at Beth-Shean (Str. VIII-VII). Excavations early this century produced stelae attributed to Nineteenth Dynasty pharaohs Seti I (1294-1279) and Rameses II (1279-1213). The destruction at the end of Str. VII may have taken place dur- ing or shortly after the reign of Mereptah (1213-1203; Mazar 1997:69). 86 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="26">Line drawing and photograph of a distinctively Egyptian pottery form of the twelfth century BCE at Beth-Shean. Most of the Egyptian- style vessels were produced locally. Photograph and drawing courtesy of A. Mazar. The early Iron I city (Lower VI), dated to the twelfth century BCE, rebuilt the preceeding stratum (VII), with the basic elements of both town and temple remaining unaltered. The final (Twentieth Dynasty) stage of a long-lived Egyptian administration shows up in this stratum, with its many Egypt- ian architectural elements (James 1966:4). Among these are a temple, the "Governor's House" used by Ramses Weser Khep- esh, commander of Beth-Shean, and materials documenting the reign of the Egyptian pharaoh Rameses III. The Lower VI ceramic assemblage included local Canaanite vessels and Egyptian-style vessels that were, for the most part, produced locally. Mediterranean wares were limited to a few Mycenean IIIC vessels (Mazar 1997:71). They, and the anthropoid coffins in the local cemetery, may be attributed to Philistine or other Sea People mercenaries in the employ of the Egyptian over- lords; however, Egyptian officials were also buried in the ceramic coffins. The reinforcement of Egyptian construction during this period underscores Egypt's effort to consolidate power dur- ing the waning years of its control over southern Canaan. The high standard of living enjoyed by the residents of Beth-Shean demonstrates its success, brought about in part by its control of agricultural estates in the Jezreel Valley. One of Rameses-Weser-Khepesh's responsibilities was the administration of these estates, as is seen in his title "Over- seer of the Great House" (Mazar 1997:72; Singer 1994:292-93). Beth-Shean Lower VI was destroyed in a violent confla- gration during the reign of Rameses VI (1143-1136) or Rameses VIII (1129-1126). This destruction, and the approximately contemporary destruction of Megiddo VIIA, mark the end of Egyptian domination in the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Val- leys (Yadin and Geva 1986:89; Mazar 1993:217-18). Beth-Shean Upper VI, the late-twelfth/early-eleventh century settlement, is more difficult to assess. Despite efforts The Stele of Ashtaroth belonged to one of two temples excavated at Beth-Shean by the University of Pennsylvania. This Canaanite cult object (H: .37 m) was joined by stele and statues of Twentieth Dynasty Egyptian pharaohs, a circumstance that indicates continued allegiance of some parts of the site's population to its former overlords. Photograph courtesy of the University of Pennsylvania. to renovate some of the earlier structures, the material culture of post-Egyptian Beth-Shean, Canaanite rather than Egyptian in nature, showed an overall decline. Even so, this occupational phase incorporated monumental architec- ture, including Building 1700 and the "Twin" or Northern and Southern Temples originally attributed to Level V (Mazar 1997:72-73). Excavators have identified these two temples, unique in plan and rich in cultic objects, with the Temples of Dagon and Ashtaroth (cf. 1 Sam 31:10). Oddly, given the recent rout- ing of Egyptian administrators from the site, stelae, and statues of Seti I, Rameses II, and Rameses III, all of whom predated the eleventh century by a hundred years and more, stood in the temples' courtyards. This would suggest that among Beth-Shean's population in the later Iron I were per- sons with Egyptian ancestry, or who had been employed by the Egyptians and continued to revere their former lead- ers. Alternately, perhaps the mixed population of Beth-Shean, including old-time Canaanites and Egyptians, and new- comers including Philistines and others, invoked the great rulers of olden days, in the hope that they might receive their beneficence and be restored to the comfort of earlier times. A conflagration, possibly attributable to David's conquest of the site, marks the end of Upper VI (Mazar 1993:219-22). Little is known about the Iron I occupation (Str. VII) at Tel Kedesh, midway between Megiddo and Taanach (Stern 1993b:860). At Tel Jezreel, south of CAfula, Iron I pottery was found in later construction fills (Ussishkin 1997a:246-47). Rehob (Tell es-Sarem) in the Beth-Shean Valley was annexed to the Egyptian stronghold at Beth-Shean and may have been occupied in the Iron I as well (Singer 1994:310; Vito 1993:1272). Tirat Sebi, in the southern Beth-Shean Valley, was inhabited briefly in the late twelfth-eleventh centuries (Gal 1979). As more is learned about these sites, the dynamics between the Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 87</page><page sequence="27">cities, towns, and villages of the Iron I Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys will become clearer. Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys: Summary The Jezreel Valley in antiquity enjoyed great strategic importance as the major northern passage between the Mediter- ranean and the Jordan River Valley. In addition, its rich and well-watered soil made it ideal for farming and rais- ing animals. The cities and towns of the Iron I Jezreel were generally affluent, containing well-constructed buildings in both private and public areas and ample storage vessels and facilities. The Jezreel offered access to the Beth-Shean Val- ley. Less advantageous climatic conditions there may have made the Beth-Shean sites dependent to some degree upon agricultural products and livestock from the Jezreel while forging a link between the cultural history of the two regions. The strategic northern valleys of Canaan underwent a series of transitions throughout the Iron I. After centuries, in some cases, of Egyptian control, the sites of the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys passed through a brief and undistin- guished stage of autonomy before once again rallying. The Philistines may have been among the leaders of the rejun- venated Canaanite culture in this critical region. The Israelites gained control of the valleys during the reign of David. The process by which Israel achieved control is uncertain, as the biblical tradition ascribes their settlement alternately to the tribes of Issachar and Asher (Josh 19:17-31) and to the tribe of Manasseh (Josh 17:11). Attempts to inte- grate biblical and archaeological data (Gal 1994) fail by virtue of the limited archaeological data and the late and tenden- tious nature of the Joshua narrative (Nacaman 1994). It may be that the creation of an Israelite self-identity in this region actually derived from the later experience of this mixed northern population, once the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Val- leys fell under David's control. The Coast and the Shephelah Although the straight Mediterranean coastline generally lacks natural bays with ports, boats were able to anchor in river mouths along the coast from Acre in the north to near Ashdod in the south. Maritime traders plying the coastline loaded products from the foothills and highlands in exchange for imported items. Overland transport between Egypt and Syria also hugged the coast, utilizing the Via Maris/Way of the Sea or "The Way to the Land of the Philistines" (Exod 13:17; Isa 8:23). Egypt attempted to control maritime and overland trans- port. In the thirteenth century, Ramesses II annexed the region, and Merneptah tightened Egyptian control. By early in the twelfth century, during the reign of Rameses ll, domestic polit- ical problems resulted in diminished Egyptian presence (Singer 1994:282-95). In the eighth year of his reign, on land, and at sea, Ramses III battled a confederation of Aegean peoples, collec- tively referred to as the Sea Peoples. These peoples subsequently settled and prospered along the southern Levantine coast. The Bible, Ramses III's reliefs, and the Onomasticon of Amenem- Opet identify the Philistines/plst, the Sekel/skl, and the Sherden as the peoples settling along the coast from south to north. Settlement in the north, on the Sharon Plain, was hin- dered by vast marshes created by kurkar ridges blocking mountain streams flowing down to the sea. While few sites have been excavated, continued LBA settlement, com- bined with a new Aegean population, created a stable and prosperous settlement occupation into Iron I. Surveys have identified many settlements on the hills east of the Sharon Plain (Kh. Baslut, Kh. Nesor, Tel Ze'evim). Settlements were also renewed or founded in the river basins: in the middle and lower basin of Nahal Hadera, in the lower basin of Nahal Alexander, and in the lower basin of Nahal ha-Tanninim near Tel Mevorakh. Collared-rim jar sherds characteristically com- prise part of the ceramic assemblage at the new settlements (Gophna and Kochavi 1966). New architectural and techno- logical features reflect the peaceful incorporation of the new population, presumably Sea Peoples. In contrast to the Jezreel and Beth Shan Valleys, evidence for an Egyptian presence in the Sharon is conspicuously absent. Compared to the marshy Sharon Plain, the Southern Coastal Plain invited settlement, with its easily cultivated, fertile hamra and rendzina soils. Later biblical tradition iden- tifies the new population settled in the region as the Philistines. Like their northern neighbors in the Sharon Plain, the Philistines prospered throughout the Iron I. Philistia did not suffer from widespread abandonment, economic vicissitudes, destruc- tion by human agency, or changes in political control. Though positioned between the coast and the high- lands, the Shephelah's fortunes were tied to the coast. In the late twelfth and eleventh century, as Egyptian activity and highland settlement waned, Philistia, the northern coast, and the Shephelah prospered. As was the case at coastal sites, LBA culture continued, now with the addition of Philistine features. Sharon Plain and Haifa Bay Late in the thirteenth century, new populations bearing northern and Aegean pottery transformed Acco, Tell Abu Hawam, and Dor into maritime entrepots. At Acco, Cypriot and Mycenean IIIB pottery found in the previous settlement, workshops, silos, and granaries illustrate maritime contacts and a possible Aegean presence before the arrival of the new population. A peaceful transition ensued, with the newcomers reusing existing installations. They constructed homes over the ramparts, produced Myc IIIClb pottery, smelted copper to make vessels, and produced dye from murex shells. The Onomasticon of Amenem-Opet (ca. 1000 BCE; M. Dothan 1993b:21) identifies these newcomers as the Sherden. Tell Abu Hawam was also a thriving maritime town in the LBA. Destroyed in ca.1200 BCE, the town was immediately rebuilt (Str. IVA-B, eleventh and tenth centuries). Structures included the reused Temple 30 and parallel rows of three- room houses with nonaxial doorways and occasional monolithic pillars, similar to those at Tell Keisan (Str. 9). Associated pottery included Phoenician Bichrome sherds, a few Philis- tine sherds, and a variant of Ashdod Ware like that found at Tel Qasile X and Miqne IV. This rebuilt town was, in turn, also destroyed (Balensi, Herrera, and Artzy 1993:10-11). 88 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="28">I. - - ; 4 A Aerial view of the port city of Dor prior to its extensive excavatic thirteenth century, newcomers brought ashlar masonry to build harl Within a century, remains at Dor portray its inhabitants as a group c Photograph courtesy of R.

At Tel Zeror and Tell Burgata, twelfth century pits and silos cut into LBA settlement remains have been attributed to the Israelites, based solely on the biblical record. Associ- ated pottery clearly continued the Canaanite coastal tradition. The fortunes of Aphek and CIzbet Sartah may be more closely tied to Philistia than to the Sharon Plain. Following destruc- tion and possible abandonment, inhabitants rebuilt Aphek's acropolis in the twelfth century. Two residential quarters demon- strated socio-economic stratification at the site. Well-built square buildings, similar to examples from Tell Abu Hawam, attest to an elite. Three such houses, identical in size and plan, each pos- sessed a back room contributing one-third of the floor space, and a front paved room, perhaps a courtyard. In contrast, hap- hazardly built structures containing fishhooks, lead net weights, and tortoise shells belonged to fishermen. Stone-lined silos and large quantities of Philistine pottery characterized the ensuing strata. By the eleventh century, Philistines lived in Aphek. Their remains included quantities of Philistine pottery, several heads from the Philistine female figurine dubbed Ashdoda, and an inscribed, but indecipherable, clay tablet (Kochavi 1993c:68-69; 1997:150-51). Iron I settlement at cIzbet Sartah (Str. III) lasted from the late thirteenth or early twelfth century through the begin- ning of the eleventh century, when the site was abandoned. 'Izbet Sartah sits on a spur bordering the alluvial plain and overlooking the coastal plain. A non-continuous wall with adjoining rooms on its exterior side "enclosed" the village courtyard, into which settlers cut stone-lined silos. Archae- ologists have brought to light similar "enclosed settlements," frequently with structures on the interior of the wall, from the Galilee to the Negev. Pottery including an imitation Myce- nean stirrup jar, kraters painted with palm trees, and local jars, cooking pots, and bowls continued LBA coastal ceramic traditions. Briefly reoccupied late in the eleventh century, only to be abandoned, the site boasted a large, four-room structure (16 x 12 m) and several smaller buildings in place of the earlier oval-shaped enclosed set- tlement. Forty-three stone-lined silos, with an average capacity of 1.3 cu. m, surrounded the large, central structure (Finkelstein 1986; 1993:652-53). Philistia and the Shephelah Early in the twelfth century, Rame- ses Im repelled a coalition of Sea Peoples that included the people termed "Philistines" in the Bible. According to later biblical tradition, the Philistines ig the coastal plain, settled the territory from Shihor in the )r side. The wall south to Ekron, in the north (osh 13:2-5). Settlement centered around five inde- pendently ruled cities, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, Ekron, and Gaza, collectively known as the Philistine Pentapolis. These orderly, urban set- tlements prospered from industrial activities, agriculture, animal husbandry, and, in the case of the coastal cities, mar- itime trade. Along with the large cities of the Pentapolis, archaeolo- gists have pinpointed a number of smaller sites. Excavations and surveys have revealed towns such as Ziklag (Tel Sera'; 1 Sam 27:5-6), Timnah (Tell Batash), and Tel Qasile, and rural settlements or "country villages " (1 Sam 6:18) such as Qubur el-Walaidah in Nahal Besor and those in Nahal Shiqmah. Seventeen farmsteads (haserim) dating to the first half of the eleventh-tenth centuries peppered the region from Gaza south to Tell el-FarCah (S) and Beersheba. All these farmsteads were located in the upper and middle reaches of the Nahals Besor and Shiqma, at least ten kilometers from a major site (with the exception of those in the vicinity of Tell el Farah [S]) yet their pottery connected them clearly with the coast (Gophna 1966; Gophna and Singer-Avitz 1984). In the twelfth century, Philistines moved into the west- ern Negev settlements of Tel Haror and Tel Sera'. They initially settled at Tel Haror, as indicated by its Monochrome pottery; later Philistine Bichrome ware at both sites illuminates their subsequent dispersal. Concentrations of the distinctive Mycenean IIIC:lb (Myc IIIC) or Philistine Monochrome pottery characterize the ini- tial Philistine settlement. Derived from Mycenean Greek ceramics, this pottery assumed a limited repertoire of Myce- nean forms: vessels for preparing and drinking wine (strainer jugs, large, and small bell-shaped craters with horizontal handles); for storing precious liquids (stirrup jars, pyx- ides); and for cooking (one-handled cooking pots). Decoration copied Mycenean prototypes, with Aegean motifs exe- cuted in a reddish-black paint with fine, neat brush strokes. Beyond these specialized vessels, most utilitarian 90 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="30">A Aerial view of Tell Batash at the beginning of excavations. While Philistine settlement centered around the so-called "Pentapolis," these urban settlements were joined by smaller sites such as this town, known biblically as Timnah. Photograph courtesy of R. Cleave. 7 A Philistine pyramidal-shaped stamp seal found at Timnah. The characteristically shaped seal depicts a lyre player. Photograph by George L. Kelm courtesy of A. Mazar. pottery, including storage jars and cooking pots, continued local forms. In addition to the specialized vessels, the Philistines repro- duced a range of objects, installations, and architectural features from their Aegean homeland. These included cul- tic clay figurines such as Ashdoda and mourning women with their hands on their heads, ceramic forms including rhyta, kernoi, craters, pyxides, and bird-shaped vessels, ceramic decorative motifs, and unperforated "waisted " and "un-waisted " cylindrical loom weights fashioned from unbaked clay. The Philistines dined on pork and mixed their wine with water. They constructed their buildings of mud- brick walls with or without stone foundations, lining the walls with mudbrick benches, and installing round hearths. The wide distribution of such features in the late thirteenth and early twelfth centuries shows that the Philistines were part of the same wave of immigrants from the Mycenean world that settled Cyprus and the Lev- antine coast. Philistine Monochrome soon evolved into Bichrome pottery. While retain- ing Aegean features, the new assemblage incorporated regional forms and deco- ' ?'- rative motifs and adopted the local two-color tradition of red and black painted decoration. Concentrations of . this Bichrome pottery from Tel Qasile ^^ ^- in the north through the Shephelah and south to Tell el-Farcah (S) attest to Philis- - . tine expansion beyond the initial enclave. : ' ~ :: :~ The distinctive decoration is easily rec- ognizable, and so Philistine pottery has been identified from sites along the coast, in the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys, and east into the Jordan Valley. While the large concentrations of Bichrome pottery from Shephelah sites indicate Philistine settlements, examples from the more distant sites are better explained as trade items or a limited Philis- tine presence. Subsequent generations of Philistines integrated local folkways with Aegean traits to produce a new distinctive cultural expression (Stone 1995). At Ekron, as at Ashkelon, Myc IIIC pottery and the earliest Bichrome ware appeared together until Monochrome was replaced by Bichrome in the mid-twelfth century. This acculturation process, seen reflected in utilitarian pottery, was parallelled in ceramic ritual ves- sels. The Tel Qasile ornamented cylindrical stands, a cup in the form of a lion's head, and a libation vessel in the shape of a female figure, reflect the melding of indigenous Lev- antine traditions with those brought from the Aegean. The Southern Coastal Plain The earliest Philistine settlement concentrated in the Pen- tapolis: Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron, Gath, and Gaza. Limited archaeological exposure of the homesteading generation lim- its our knowledge of the newcomers. Homeland, language, and religion may only be surmised. For the twelfth and eleventh centuries, Ashdod and Ekron are the most exten- sively excavated and published Pentapolis sites. Both began as unfortified urban centers which produced Canaanite and Myc IIIC pottery. Each site demonstrated increased reliance on pig and cattle, with a concomitant decrease in the consumption of sheep and goat. Increasing numbers of pigs in Philistia stand in sharp contrast to their absence from high- land sites (Hesse 1990:214-18). Twelfth century Ashdod measured about 8 ha, but grew to 40 ha by the end of the eleventh century. The earliest set- tlers erected a city over the partially destroyed Late Bronze city.

This sin- gular segment of casemate wall joined other expanses of city walls of solid construction. Residences, courtyards, and pot- tery workshops for local and Myc IIIC wares abutted the walls. In the western quarter of the city, two building com- plexes stood on either side of a street. The northern complex consisted of a small apsidal "shrine," to the north of which stood a row of rooms and a columned hall. Across the street stood a large public building measuring 17 x 13 m. Excava- tors unearthed the well-known, nearly complete Mycenean-style figurine of a seated female goddess whose body forms a throne-nicknamed "Ashdoda"-in this quarter of the city. From Ashkelon, Ekron, and Tell Qasile, archaeologists have since added to the Philistine terra cotta collection frag- ments of similar figurines, with long necks, flat-topped coiffures, occasionally with breasts, and in one case (Qasile) perhaps nursing a baby. In the mid-eleventh century, settlement at Ashdod spread beyond the acropolis. The earliest settlement in the lower city, where digging unearthed pottery workshops, was sub- sequently fortified with a four-chambered mudbrick gate and solid wall (Dothan and Porath 1982:7-13; 1993:50-83; M. Dothan 1993c:96-98). Ekron/Tel Miqne was an important urban center through- out the twelfth and eleventh centuries. From the initial Philistine settlement, Ekron was a large, well-planned, for- tified city. Strong mudbrick fortification walls encircled an area of ca. 20 ha with square and horseshoe-shaped kilns inside the perimeter, administrative buildings at its center, and elite residences located between the two. The best-pre- served kiln, square in shape, was associated with Myc IIIC pottery and Aegean-type figurines. Inhabitants constructed Building 350 (a palace or shrine) on top of the large public building 351. Cultic and elaborate metal objects, platforms, and benches found in its side rooms and main hall all con- firm the cultic nature of the structure. A circular hearth flanked by pillars in the main hall ties the building to palaces of the Mycenean world. Incised bovine scapulae and kernoi from a shrine near the city wall (Str. VI-V) also link Ekron to Sea Peoples' settlements at Ashkelon and in Cyprus (T. Dothan 1990; Dothan and Gitin 1993) The Egyptians may have occupied sites in contraposition to the Pentapolis strongholds in order to monitor and con- tain Philistine settlement. The fortress erected at Tel Mor faced Ashdod, Gezer was rebuilt to challenge Ekron, Lachish was paired with Asheklon some 30 km to the east, and Tell esh-Shariah countered Gath. Abundant Egyptian pottery and the presence of objects with the name of Rameses III iden- tify and date these strategically situated sites. According to this reconstruction, the breakdown of Egyptian hegemony permitted the Philistines to expand beyond their original ter- ritory. This phase of Philistine expansion left concentrations of Philistine Bichrome pottery at sites from Tel Qasile in the north, through Gezer, Timnah, and Tell Beit Mirsim, to Tell el-FarCah (S) in the south (Stager 1995:342-43, fig. 2). i,' Iron I remains at Ashdod included the famous Mycenean-style figurine known as Ashdoda. Its seated female goddess forms her throne with her own body. Similar figurines have emerged from Ashkelon, Ekron, and Tell Qasile. Drawing from M. Dothan, Ashdod: II- Ill, fig. 91:1. I I I I _ _ Tel Qasile, the most informative site from this second phase of Philistine occupation, displayed Philistine conti- nuity in material culture, secular architecture, and cult. Newcomers arriving from further south settled around the sacred area and eventually spread across the site. They erected houses in blocks defined by an orthogonal street network. These residences measured approximately 100 m2 each, with mudbrick walls (often with no stone foundation), benches, and a hearth. Ovens, loom weights, and installations for grinding and crushing cereals, olives, and grapes indicate courtyard activities. The mud-brick plastered hearth in the center of a large hall lined with mudbrick benches, paral- leled at Enkomi, Cyprus, evokes Aegean secular public buildings (Mazar 1985:104; 1986:3-15). In strata of the second half of the twelfth through the early tenth century, distinctive, locally produced Philistine pottery constituted roughly twenty percent of the ceramic repertoire. Red-slipped wares painted with black decoration first appeared in this time-frame. At its end, Philistine pottery remained plentiful in the residences and temples of the sacred area, but not in the southern residences (Mazar 1985:122-23). Over the course of 150 years, the Tell Qasile temple was enlarged and remodelled but the orientation and location of its altar room remained unchanged. The original temple was a squarish (6.4 x 6.6 m) mudbrick hall with benches and a raised platform opposite the doorway. Renovations turned it into a larger (5.7 x 8.5 m) stone structure with benches lining the walls and a partition blocking its far rear comer. A small adjoining chamber, Shrine 300, abutted the rear wall. Favissae in the courtyard preserved ritual objects, pottery, and animal bones. The third phase of the temple added a bent-axis entrance and a raised platform with a "treasury 92 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) I I (Continued on page 101) c-I?

Ashdoda figurines, especially compared to Ashdod (Mazar 1980:119), Tel Aphek, and Ashkelon, strong ties with the Sea Peoples culture as manifested in twelfth and eleventh century Cyprus remain apparent. The site was destroyed at the end of the eleventh century (Mazar 1980). Southern coastal plain sites such as Azor and Tell el-Farah (S) yielded a wide array of burial types, including several not found in the central highlands. The twelfth and eleventh century Azor cemetery included pit graves, mudbrick and stone cist graves, jar burials, and a single "Phoenician " cremation burial. Philistine pottery and pottery in the LBA tradition were placed in the jar burials and in the simple and cist graves. In the Tell el-FarCah (S) cemeteries, the deceased rested in simple graves and stone- or mudbrick-lined cist graves, many provisioned with Philistine pottery. By con- trast, Egyptian artifacts and anthropoid coffins similar to examples found in Egypt proper demonstrate that Deir el- Balah was an Egyptian cemetery (T. Dothan 1979).

Beth Shemesh typifies Shephelah sites that prospered during the period of Philistine expansion and highland aban- donment (Str. III; also Gezer Str. XIII-XI, Tell Batash/Timnah Str. V, Tell Beit Mirsim Str. B2 and Tell Halif Str. VII). Indigenous LBA architectural and ceramic traditions con- tinued side by side with the introduction of Philistine Bichrome pottery, seals, figurines, and construction techniques. Thus, at Beth Shemesh, the large, well-planned, relatively wealthy village included a monumental building contain- ing Philistine Bichrome pottery and gold jewelry. Two square houses were partitioned into multiple inner rooms without structural pillars. The more elaborate house encompassed an area of 169 m2 (Grant 1931:pl. XXV, XXIX; Braemer 1982:198-99). Furnaces, pottery blowpipes, and bronze frag- ments attest to metalworking at the site (Bunimovitz and Lederman 1993:250-53). In the eleventh century BCE, Tell Beit Mirsim's most conspicuous house reused LBA house walls. Covering 204 m2, it possessed an unusual trapezoidal plan with a central corridor and rectangular rooms to either side (Braemer 1982:92, 181-82, fig. 31). Contemporary Batash offered a somewhat similar building, also a rehabilitated LBA house (Kelm and Mazar 1995:95-97). At Tell Beit Mirsim, grain pits were extremely common, and Philistine Bichrome sherds appeared in the secondary fill (Albright 1943:8-10, 19-22. pl. IIa). The partial destruction and desertion of Gezer, evident in localized destruction levels, robber pits, and dumped trash, preceeded the Iron I occupation. Unlike the other Shephelah sites, Gezer's Iron I settlement repeatedly met destruction. In the sequence uncovered on its acropolis, a public granary destroyed in the early twelfth century was rebuilt, only to be destroyed a second time in the mid- twelfth century. Following the second destruction, occupants built two houses over what had been the adjacent threshing floor. These two ill-fated courtyard homes burnt down late in the twelfth century. They were rebuilt, destroyed a second time, poorly rebuilt, and finally abandoned. Residents used local pottery and Philistine Bichrome ware contem- poraneously. However, the Philistine pottery was rare and declined in frequency and quality through time. Based on the small percentage of Philistine pottery, Gezer's excavators concluded that it was inhabited by indigenous residents, sup- plemented by a minority population of Philistine rulers (Dever 1986; 1993a:504). The Coast and The Shephelah: Summary Coastal and Shephelah settlement in Iron I proceeded independently of that in the central highlands. Peoples with northern and Aegean ties settled the region. Similar mater- ial culture at Cypriot sites suggests the same populations inhabited in both areas. In the north, the Sharon Plain became home to people who produced Phoenician Bichrome pottery and who had a tradition of ashlar masonry construction. Their influence extended from the Haifa Bay region through the Jezreel and Esdraelon Valleys. The revitalization of the region in the eleventh century derived from their maritime prosperity. Egyptian texts identify the skls/skl/tkr and sherdani as the new populations. Further south, the presence of Mycenean IIIC:lb pottery and mudbrick construction identifies the initial Sea Peoples settlement. Quantities of Philistine Bichrome pottery char- acterize subsequent expansion. These southern Levantine settlers were identified as plst/Philistines in Egyptian and 102 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) _ 7~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~p N- -11Aw ~ 1 ., . ,,) ^^g^l' I^ .-</page><page sequence="34">biblical records. Philistine coastal and Shephelah sites prospered through the eleventh century, concomitant with the abandonment of highland sites. In addition to those new features introduced by Aegean settlers, Bronze Age ceramic and architectural traditions also continued into the Iron Age. The lowlands displayed a greater variation in material culture, technology, forms of burial, and architecture than did the highlands. Arguably, this variation among sites resulted from differences among ethnic groups. Thus, according to one model, the inhabitants of Gezer would be Canaanite, the settlers of cIzbet Sartah "proto-Israelite," and residents of Tel Miqne/Ekron "Philistine"(Dever 1998:47-48). Yet each of these proximate sites hosts an admixture of dif- ferent populations. The contrast between Dor in the Sharon Plain, Ashdod in Philistia, and Gezer in the Shep- helah is more clear. The settlers of these three sites were certainly different peoples with distinctive cultures. Several features considered characteristic of Iron II Israelite culture first appeared at Iron I coastal, Shephelah, and Negev sites. Collared-rim storejar sherds turned up at surveyed sites throughout the Sharon Plain. Four-room houses and collared- rim storejars appeared together at cIzbet Sartah. Four-room houses featured at the Negev sites of Tel Masos, Tel Beersheba and Tel Serac. Iron I peoples hewed the earliest bench tombs at Tel Aitun, Tell el-Far'ah (S), Gezer, and Lachish. The pres- ence of Iron I lowland features in the Iron II highlands suggests people moving from the lowlands eastward and northward into the highlands. This projected migration contradicts the biblical account of Israelites moving westward from Trans- jordan into Cisjordan and suggests the mixed origins of those who populated the Israelite cities of the Iron II. At 17 x 12 m in size, Tell Beit Mirsim's largest house (SE 12/3) adopted a trapezoidal plan that reused LBA house walls. The site prospered during the eleventh-century era of Philistine expansionism. The Negev The Negev afforded poor agricultural conditions com- pared to the relatively well-watered, fertile soils of the north. In the northwestern Negev, agriculture was possible in the loess soils of the Gaza and Besor Brooks when annual rain- fall reached 250 mm. Conditions deteriorated further to the south and east in the semi-arid Arad and Beersheba Val- leys. With approximately 60 mm of rainfall annually, sustained agriculture was possible only with irrigation, but pastoral- ism flourished. After a gap in settlement through the LBA, repopulation stems, in part, from Egyptian and, later, Philistine trade in the late thirteenth or early twelfth century. For example, the western Negev sites of Tel Haror and Tel Serac demonstrated closer ties to coastal Philistine sites than to contemporary sites in the Beersheba Valley. Tel Masos was the major Iron I site in the central Negev, located in the center of the Beersheba Valley, close to perennial wells. One of the largest Iron I settlements in the entire country, the site-perhaps a fort-was situated along the trade route connecting the Mediterranean coast with the Arabah and Transjordan. The late thirteenth cen- tury town is reconstructed as an approximately 8 ha enclosed settlement with broadroom and three-room contiguous struc- tures. Following the destruction of this earliest level, in the twelfth and eleventh centuries inhabitants erected additional houses, both broadroom and four-room in plan, perhaps posi- tioned to ring the summit. Two well-preserved, pillared, four-room Houses (2 and 167) covered 117 and 105 m2 respec- tively. During this period, the fort remained in use and a building containing a basin and cultic objects stood near the middle of the site. The diversity of ceramics, including Philis- tine, Midianite, Phoenician, Egyptian, and Negebite pottery (Kempinski 1993b:986-89), suggests that Tel Masos thrived along an east-west trade route (Mazar 1990:336). During the course of the Iron I, Tel Beersheba was transformed from a village of subterranean housing to an Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 103</page><page sequence="35">above ground, enclosed settlement. In the earliest Iron Age strata, pits carved into the bedrock served for storage and dwellings. They measured between five and ten meters in diameter and were three meters deep. Pottery, two Egypt- ian scarabs, and Philistine sherds date the settlement from the second half of the twelfth through the mid-eleventh century. Stone houses, introduced in the next level (third quarter of the eleventh century), coexisted alongside pit dwellings. One Beersheba house, broad- room in plan, measured 105.5 m2. The final Iron I stratum, built over its aban- doned predecessor, can be reconstructed as a planned compound with four-room houses ringing the settlement, their external walls forming a defensive perimeter and their entrances facing in towards the central courtyard. The cen- tral courtyard likely served to corral livestock; the large number of cattle bones retrieved from Beersheba attests to the importance of pastoralism in this semi-arid region. Two small towers guarded the entrance into the compound. The comparably sized settlements of ?,? .1-? ?rt?. ; +Sglcr rccu li c ., c;? .. J: (? 3 P 3 :?CJ PET?

Tel Beersheba and Tel Esdar each consisted of approximately twenty structures. In the twelfth century, Philistines moved into the west- ern Negev settlements of Tel Haror and Tel Serac. Both sites had been destroyed at the end of the LBA. Whereas a Philistine settlement directly followed the destruction of Tel Serac, Tel Haror had been rebuilt before the Philistines arrived. Haror's impressive, early twelfth century building produced no Philistine pottery. The succeeding strata yielded well-con- structed buildings with mudbrick walls and stone foundations, stone-lined grain silos, and large mud-lined refuse pits, the largest of which measured 5 m in diameter and 3.5 m in depth. Philistine Monochrome and Bichrome pottery confirm Philis- tine presence in the twelfth and eleventh centuries (Oren et al. 1991; Oren 1993a:582-83). Unidentified perpetrators destroyed the Egypto-Canaan- ite city at Tel Serac, dated by its lack of Mycenean, Cypriot, and Philistine wares to the first half of the twelfth century. The new settlers built four-room houses directly above the destroyed city. Philistine Bichrome pottery, Ashdod-type ware, and irregularly hand-burnished pottery identify the new settlers as Philistines. Tel Serac provides an example of a peaceful interface between Philistines and Israelites. The four-room house plan remained in use, with no signs of a destruction or a gap, from the Philistine settlement of Iron I into the Israelite Iron II period (Oren 1993b:1330-32). During a brief period of improved climatic conditions in the eleventh century BCE (Herzog 1994:139), new settlements were founded in the vicinity of Tel Masos (Arad, Tel Esdar, Bir es-Seba, Nahal Yattir, and Haserim) and in the more arid region south of Beersheba (Horvat Rahba, Mesad Reffed, and Mesad Hatira). At the end of the eleventh century and the beginning of the tenth century BCE, their inhabitants aban- doned Tel Masos and many other Iron I Negev settlements. Negev: Summary The Negev settlements of Tel Masos, Tel Esdar, and Tel Beersheba, although ranging in size from ca. .3-8 ha, were all built with perimeter houses enclosing a central open area. This arrangement was not unique to the Negev. Rather, it was also utilized at Hurvat Avot in the Galilee, Tel Qasile near the coast, and at 'Izbet Sartah, (Ai, Tell en-Nasbeh, and Giloh in the northern foothills and highlands. The ring of dwellings at Tel Beersheba and Tel Esdar, their houses built close together and doorways facing the interior of the compound, served to defend settlers and corral their herds. At Tel Masos, a depot on a major trade route, struc- tures erected beyond the outer perimeter and building entrances on the exposed outer face compromised the defensive poten- tial of the housing arrangement. The twelfth-eleventh century "fort" of Tel Masos and the late-eleventh century Beersheba gate towers suggest a local authority with sufficient resources and support to build communal structures. While commonly thought to serve defensive purposes, Tel Masos's structures better functioned to protect communal storage. Elaborate structures and orderly settlement plans suggest a higher degree of centralization, 104 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) c?( .

Drawing by Rhonda ^ Root. &gt; The Baluca Stele-dated to the Iron Age I-depicts an investiture scene styled after an Egyptian model. The central character may be a shasu warrior receiving his commission from an Egyptian god and goddess. This stele manifests contacts between Egypt and Transjordan which, though rare, underscore Egypt's continuing interest in the region. Luxor commemorate an Egyptian military campaign in Moab and mention several Moabite cities (Miller 1992:77-78; Worschech 1997:231). Slightly later, the unprovenanced Egypt- ian-style Baluca Stela shows a shasu warrior appearing before an Egyptian god and goddess. Although it may date to the tenth century, the stele seems to reflect Twentieth Dynasty, early twelfth century motifs (Dearman 1992:70; Worschech 1997:231). A Twentieth Dynasty scarab found at Kh. Lehun in Moab bears the incorrectly written name of the Egypt- ian god Amun-Re (Homes-Fredericq 1992:190). A letter from an Egyptian official written around 1000 BCE evidences some late contact between Egypt and Seir (Kitchen 1992:27). Although limited in number, when taken together these written and iconographic references underscore Egyptian interest in Transjordan at the end of the LBA II and into the Iron I. In addition, they mention by name the territories of Moab and Edom and several cities, and they suggest one important element of the pastoral population. The very men- tion of Moab, Edom, and Seir permits the conclusion that entities of some sort, territorial rather than political, were known in this region at the beginning of the Iron Age. Transjordan in the Bible. Many biblical passages make reference to the places, peoples, and leaders of Transjordan in their portrait of Israelite conquest and settlement. These passages have at times been considered descriptive of the Iron I, but their historical accuracy must be questioned. Later, monarchical Israel was often involved with the nations east of the Jordan River, and some biblical texts can be related to international affairs in the Iron II. According to biblical tradition legendary beings, the Anakim or giants called Emim, Rephaim, Zamzummim, Zuzim, Nephilim, and Perrizim, stand out among Trans- jordan's (and Cisjordan's) earliest inhabitants (Gen 14:5; Num 13:32-33; Deut 1:28; 2:10-11,20-22; 3:13; see Noort 1987). The later residents of the region, the people of Ammon, Moab, and Edom, shared a common geneology with Israel, as the Bible traced their ancestry to Abraham (Gen 25:19-30; Gen 19:37-38). Throughout the narrative of Israelite conquest, relations among these peoples varied; the same can be said of rela- tions among the Israelite tribes themselves. Bonds between Israel and Ammon, Moab, and Edom were intimated in pas- sages (such as Num 20:14-21; 21:4, 10-13; Deut 2:1-19) in which Israelites bypassed their territory rather than engage in military conflict in order to pass through (Weippert 1979:16). It was later suggested that this was in response to God's command, as Yahweh reminded Israel of their common ori- gins (Deut 2:1-19). Israel's geneological ties to Edom were emphasized (Deut 23:7-8). Gen 36:31-39 listed the pre-Israelite kings of Edom; Gen 36:40-43 listed the chiefs of Edom said to have descended from Esau. However, the absence of 106 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="38">cities in Edom before the eighth century (see below) sug- gests that Genesis 36 does not accurately illuminate the Iron I (so Bartlett 1992:14-15; MacDonald 1994:235-36). Military conflict occurred as well. The Israelites fought with various Transjordanian kings on their way into Canaan. These episodes included the legendary (with Weippert 1979:21-24) defeats of Sihon, king of Heshbon (Num 21:21-30; Deut 1:3-4; 2:24-37) and Og, king of Bashan (Num 21:33-35; Deut 3:1-11), as well as the outwitting of Balak, king of Moab (Num 22-24). One story counts Ammonites and Moabites as Israel's enemies (Deut 23:3-6), while another celebrates Israel's victories over the Transjordanian kings and allocates their territories to two Israelite tribes (Josh 12:1-6) Even with Israel settled in Transjordan, the narrative of conflicted relationships continued. While the initial con- struction of the Moabite cities of Dibon and Aroer was attributed to the Gadites (Num 32:34-35), Israelites report that Eglon, king of Moab, ruled over them for eighteen years (Judg 3:12-30). While this passage indicates a contentious rela- tionship between Israel and Moab, another suggests closer ties. Moab was the initial locus for the book of Ruth, set in the era of the Judges. In a time of need, food for Israelites was available there (Ruth 1:1-2). Ruth, a Moabite who became Israelite, was a grandmother of the Israelite king David. Iron- ically, David later wielded his military might against his grandmother's kin, as against the other nations of Trans- jordan (2 Sam 8:2, 11-13). The stories of the Judges recount the conflicted rela- tionships among the Israelite tribes and the peoples of Transjordan. For example, two judges, Jair (Judg 10:3-5) and Jephthah (Judg 10:18-12:7), came from among the Israelites in Gilead. The story of Jephthah recounts Israel's ultimately successful efforts to free itself from eighteen years of oppression by a coalition of Ammonites and Philistines (Judg 10:6-11:33). The relationship between the Gileadites and Israelite tribes was less than friendly (Judg 5:17). Gileadites were among the eastern tribes who joined with the Midianites and Amalekites in battle against a coalition of western Israelites tribes led by Gideon (Judg 6:33-7:23). The mention of Moab, Edom, and Seir in early biblical poetry (Exod 15:15; Judg 5:4) has led some to suggest that Transjordanian chiefdoms were known to Israel as early as the late thirteenth, twelfth, or early eleventh centuries BCE (Cross 1973:124-25; Freedman 1979:96). Since archaeologi- cal evidence does not support the notion of dense and organized settlement in southern Transjordan in the Iron I, these poems probably reflect later perspectives on Israel's early days (Bartlett 1992:13-14). The biblical narratives that depict Transjordan in the pre- monarchic period were composed several centuries after the events they purport to describe. They provide us with a picture of what Israel's later historians believed to have been the situation centuries earlier. Even if the Deuteronomists had access to some earlier compositions, those compositions would not be eyewitness accounts of the conquest and settlement of Transjordan (Nacaman 1994:222). Furthermore, neither the historians nor the prophets, who also mentioned Transjordan, had first-hand knowledge of its topography, and their know- ledge of its premonarchical era was both extremely limited and riddled with mistakes. Overall, the Bible cannot be considered useful when reconstructing the history of Iron I Transjordan (Bartlett 1989:53,93; 1992:15-16,288-89; Bienkowski 1992:1; Lapp 1994:216; Na'aman 1994:241). This said, the Transjordan episodes describing con- quest and coexistence in what we call the Iron I are not without value. Their detailed stories underscore the complexity of relationships among the many peoples later believed to have occupied the region at this time. Given the difficulties involved in identifying ethnic groups by reference to archaeological data alone, this may be their greatest contribution to our understanding of this period. The Jordan Valley and Central Transjordan The deep rift of the Jordan River Valley creates a geo- graphic border that was as important in antiquity as it is in modem times. On the east side, central Transjordan is bounded on the north by the Yarmuk River and on the south by the Wadi Zerqa. The fertile Baq'ah Valley played a pivotal role in the Iron I settlement of this region and of Ammon to its south. The biblical authors knew this as the agriculturally rich land of Gilead (Num 32:1). Some important Jordan Valley sites, including Tell es- Sacidiyeh, Tell Deir 'Alla, and Tell Mazar, were settled in the both LBA II and Iron I. Other sites, often less well known, are situated in the highlands farther east. The settlement at Tell es-Saqidiyeh, located on the south bank of the Wadi Kufrinjeh near the Jordan River, relates to the Nineteeth and Twentieth Dynasty Egyptian occupation of Canaan in the LBA and Iron I. In this, it resembles Beth-Shean, to its north on the west shore of the Jordan. At this time, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh included a typical Egyptian governor's resi- dency. Its cemetery areas date to the thirteenth and twelfth centuries, and they too underscore the Egyptian character of the site. The extravagant riches of the burials and the pres- ence of many Egyptian-style burial features point to the wealthy and cosmopolitan nature of the site. Certainly, the settlement there in part protected Egyptian interests in the Jordan Valley. At the same time, Tell es-Sacidiyeh may owe its richness to the influence of Philistine culture, reaching the Jordan Valley through Megiddo and Beth-Shean (Sauer n.d.; Pritchard 1993:1295-96; Tubb 1993:1299-1300). Following the destruction of this level, squatters re-occu- pied parts of the site, but as much as a century passed before the site was fully re-occupied. In the mid-eleventh to early tenth centuries, settlers built small buildings. A tripartite structure may have been a small temple (Tubb 1993:1298-99). The multi-mound site of Tell el-Mazar is located near the Jordan River and Wadi Rajib, south of Tell el-Sacidiyeh. Occu- pied in the LBA, in the Iron I, the site's smaller mound contained a sanctuary-a large tripartite building with a courtyard. Benches lined one room in which excavators found chal- ices and a fenestrated ceramic stand among other vessels. Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 107</page><page sequence="39">It is dated to the latter part of the Iron I (late eleventh-tenth centuries). A second sanctuary may have been located on the nearby, larger for- tified mound (Yassine 1984). Perhaps the biblical Succoth or even Penuel, Tell Deir cAlla farther southeast sits astride the Wadi Zerqa. In the LBA, the site included a regional sanctuary used by people from the Jor- dan Valley and elsewhere. It probably held a place on an international trade network and was the focus of Egyptian attention as well. Archaeologists have documented contacts between the inhabitants of Deir 'Alla and those of the Baqcah Valley. New people, possibly transhumant pas- toralists from the Baqcah Valley, settled at Deir cAlla early in the Iron I (van der Steen 1995:155-56). The Iron strata included twelve separate phases, spanning the twelfth through the eleventh/tenth cen- turies. Some Philistine pottery was found associated with the earlier phases. Initially, transient smiths used the site in winter, growing crops, grazing their animals, and engag- ing in metalworking. Large courtyards boasted silos and bronze-smelting furnaces. The LBA sanctuary continued to be used for worship. Later, as the seasonal inhabitants became increasingly invested in plow agriculture, construction included simple houses, a substantial building, and a gated town wall (Franken 1969:20-21; Domemann 1983:166-67; van der Kooij 1993:340). Other sites in this region are less well known. Both Tall el- Husn (Husn cAijlun) and Abila contained pottery, including transitional wares, from the LBA II, Iron I, and Iron II. Archi- tecture of the Iron I has yet to be uncovered. Tabaqat Fahl also contained Iron I materials (Geraty and Willis 1986:32-33). The Jordan Valley and Central Transjordan: Summary In the LBA II/early Iron I, the Egyptian presence at Tall es-Sacidiyeh and Tall Deir (Alla resulted in a network of settlements dependent upon these two central sites, sites that together supported Egyptian trade interests in the Jordan Valley and north into Syria (van der Steen 1995:153). Once Egyptian contact with the cities of the Jordan Valley came to an end in the mid-twelfth century BCE, outside influences diminished. Evidence for this can be seen in the severe restric- tion in Egyptian materials, imported vessels, and Philistine wares at this time (Dornemann 1983:168). Those Jordan Valley and central Transjordanian sites that had been inhabited in the LBA II remained in use in the Iron I, suggesting a peaceful process of transition (i 1995:128-30). In the LBA II, the residents of the Jordan Valley and Baqcah Valley sites engaged in the interdependency typical of farm- ers and transhumants. This positive relationship may have facilitated a smooth transition into the Iron I, into an era free of Egyptian interference. The destruction level at Tell es- Sacidiyeh may reflect the local effort to eradicate Egyptian involvement in the region. Surveys indicate Iron I sites stretched along the Zerqa and, to a lesser degree, along the other Jordan The fertile BaqCah Valley of central Transjordan was the locus of settlement in both LBA II and Iron I. The inhabitants of the valley maintained close ties with the inhabitants of the Jordan Valley site of Deir CAlla, which may have served as a regional sanctuary. Photograph from McGovern 1986b: pl. 2a. Valley wadis. This reflects an effort to be closer to sources of water in order to create successful farming settlements. New sites were established alongside those with LBA antecedents (van der Steen 1995:153-55). To what degree the Iron I settlement in this region, and the relationship between its inhabitants and those farther south in Ammon, and farther west in Cisjordan, finds its reflection in the biblical narrative resists easy assessment. However, the tribal narratives related in Judges could find a setting in the Iron I settlements in the Jordan Valley and central Transjordan. Only some Iron I sites showed continuity into the Iron II. The peaceful transition from LBA II to Iron I can be contrasted with the passage into the Iron II, one seemingly filled with disruptions (Ji 1995:128-30). The crisis at the end of the Iron I may be related to events taking place farther south, in Ammon. Ammon The land of Ammon is situated at the western edge of the Syro-Arabian Desert, between the Wadi Zerqa on the north and Moab on the south (Miller and Hayes 1986:49). The north- ern plain of Moab extending south to the Wadi Mujib was at times claimed by Ammon (Deut 21:21-30; Judg 11:12-14). There is no definitive geographic divide separating the two regions. Ammon receives an annual rainfall of 500 mm and is suit- able for raising fruits and cereals and for pasturing animals (LaBianca and Younker 1995:402-3). Geographically, it can be subdivided into the territory around Amman and the Baqcah Valley. Excavated materials include tombs or tomb groups (Sahab, Jabal en-Nuzhah, Jebel al-Hawayah, Tell Irbid), single-period sites (Kh. al-Hajjak, Rujm al-Malfuf South), and numerous stratified sequences (Tall Sahab, Tall 108 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="40">r. 4.'..- - ^^^^^ rim storejars.

The discovery of charred male skele- tons, ballistica, and lance and spear points signals the total destruction of the site, tentatively dated to the mid-twelfth century. Little new occupation took place at 'Umayri until the seventh century (Herr 1992:176; Clark 1994). Some sites display continuity in burial practices. One Iron I burial cave at Sahab contained LBA bronze weapons and pottery and Egyptian artifacts alongside Iron I materials. A second tomb there, and tombs at Jabal en-Nuzhah (northern Amman), at Jabal al-Hawayah (Baqcah Valley) and at Tall Irbid were in use from the LBA into the Iron I, while a tomb at Sahab was used in the Iron I (Ibrahim 1987:78; Ji 1995:126). A new burial form, the collared-rim jar burial, was first identified in this region in the Iron I. It occurred at Sahab and at certain sites west of the Jordan River and may reflect Hittite antecedants (i 1995:137 and references there). Secondary burials were common in the late Iron I/Iron II transitional period. This fact, combined with the occupa- tional gap at so many late Iron I sites in Ammon, suggests the resurgence of a nomadic population (Ji 1995:133 and ref- erences there). At the same time, changes are evident. Overall, Iron I pot- tery drew on LBA antecendents. For example, coil-built pottery, first popular in the LBA II, reached its peak in the Iron I (McGovern 1987:268). However, the ceramic assem- blage at some sites (at Tall Sahab, Kh. al-Hajjar, Tall Safut and 'Iraq al-Amir) now included collared-rim storejars. These jars may be associated with the collared-rim jars of the hill country and certain other sites west of the Jordan. Their appearance in Ammon might reflect a small-scale migration from west to east, possibly that of the Israelite tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the eastern half of Manasseh (so Ji 1995:134-37). Alternately, the idea that their appearance resulted from shared technological and adaptive strategies must be con- sidered (London 1989). Changes in metalwork and other artifacts have been doc- umented in the Iron I sites of Ammon (Ibrahim 1987:78). Capitalizing on the availability of requisite materials, the manufacture and use of iron implements began in the Baq'ah Valley in the LBA II and intensified in the Iron I (McGov- ern 1987:268). Metalworking may have been associated with the settlement of pastoralists. Additionally, it may have been the tool that facilitated Transjordanian military victories, including those over the peoples of Gilead and over the land west of the Jordan (Judg 10:7-9, 17-18; Ji 1995:134-36). Ammon: Summary In the wake of intensive excavating and surveying, Iron I Ammon is better known than previously. However, exposure of materials from this period remains limited. Over- all, the Iron I can be characterized as follows. There was no major occupational break between the LBA II and the Iron I. Rather, its Iron I settlement was an outgrowth of that of the LBA. Alongside evidence for continuity, new elements in the Iron I material culture point to change. Still, data for outside interest in the area, either Egyptian or Philistine, are extremely limited. For the most part, the settled residents of the region lived in small villages, yet the evidence from certain sites, particularly Tall Sahab, and cUmayri, and the Amman Citadel, suggests social, political, and economic complexity. What factors precipitated the LBA II/Iron I settlements? A process of intensification has been suggested, as pastoral- ists turned to farming toward the end of the LBA II (Hopkins 1993). Gradually, they founded a number of settlements in the Transjordanian highlands. As their venture into plow agriculture succeeded, ties to the land deepened, and sites with significant architecture and relative longevity were estab- lished. Iron I sites in the Jordan Valley may also be related to this process. People from the Baq'ah Valley region settled along the Wadi Zerqa. When, for various reasons, farming no longer was the choice of many, a period of abatement followed. Causes may include both lack of agricultural know-how and external mil- itary pressures. Some two-thirds of all excavated sites exhibit a late Iron I gap. At many, the archaeological record indicates destruction rather than abandonment. Late in the Iron I, the "new" farmers of the LBA II/Iron I evidently resumed their seasonal pastoral migrations. Throughout this period, tribal relationships, including those among farm- ers and pastoralists, remained important (Ji 1995; LaBianca 1990; LaBianca and Younker 1995). On a contrary note, how- ever, the perceived gap in setttlement at the end of the Iron I may be a consequence of an insufficiently developed ceramic chronology or of limited surveys and excavations (so McGov- ern 1992:181). As yet, no data substantiates the ethnic identity of the inhabitants of Iron I Ammon. Later, in the Iron II, their iden- tity is clear; they are the Ammonites, known through their own distinctive material culture and by reference to bibli- cal and Neo-Assyrian texts. But for the Iron I, the issue remains unresolved, and the term Ammonite is best restricted to their Iron II and Persian Period successors (Herr 1992:175). This said, there is no reason to imagine that the majority of the population of Iron II Ammon came from outside the region. Rather, evidence suggests that their trajectory toward nation- hood was fueled by the sedentarization, once again, of those people who had populated the sites of early Iron I Trans- jordan and who had left them again later in the Iron I, as conditions became adverse. Over time, others, including peo- ple from Anatolia, Syria, and the west side of the Jordan, may have joined with them, ultimately blending together to form the Iron II nation of Ammon. Moab The territory of Moab is located on the high plateau east of the Dead Sea. Its northern border, dividing Moab from Ammon, is somewhat undefined and in antiquity others, including Ammonite and Israelite kings, often claimed north- ern Moab (Deut 21:21-30; Judg 11:12-14). In consequence, the political alignment of some sites in northern Moab is uncertain (Dearman 1997:206-7). Wadi Mujib (Aron River) bisects Moab and most of its important cities were located on the accessible northern Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 111</page><page sequence="43">plateau (misor, Josh 13:9; Jer 48:21). The region known in antiquity as the Plains of Moab (Carbot moPab; Num 22:1; 33:48) is in the Jordan Valley, contiguous with the northern plateau. Less well known than the northern plateau, the central (or Karak) plateau, was relatively isolated between Wadi Mujib and Wadi Hasa. Despite Moab's location between the arid Dead Sea and the Syro-Arabian Desert, the northern high- lands receive sufficient rainfall for farming and animal pasturage. The water in the major wadis is inaccessible due to their steep sides (Miller 1997a:194-96). Moab's northern plain is increasingly well known due to extensive surveying and excavation projects. Sites excavated there include Tall Hisban, Tall Jalul, 'Aracir, Kh. al-Mudayna, Madaba, al-'Al, Dhiban, and Lehun. Known primarily from surveys, the central plateau saw little occupation in the Iron I. Given the different geographic and historical realities of the two regions, and the inequities in their exploration (Miller 1997a:199), discussion here focusses primarily on the northern plateau. Tall Hisban was an unfortified village during the Iron I; remains of the LBA are limited to sherd material. The three Iron I phases at Hesban have been poorly preserved. They begin in the twelfth century and are separated by destruc- tion layers; an eleventh century destruction marks the end of Iron I Hesban. The pottery of the Iron I included collared- rim storejars. The site was not immediately resettled (Herr 1992:176; Ji 1995:123; Miller 1997a:199). Its identification with the biblical Heshbon of King Sihon (Num 21:27-28) is uncer- tain, as no LBA building remains have been identified at Tall Hisban (Geraty 1997:20; Dearman 1997:206-7). A number of other sites, including al-CAl and Jalul, offer materials from the Iron I, but due to the state of their exploration, not much can be said about their occupation. The necropolis at Madaba contained a tomb from the thir- teenth century and one from the Iron I-II (Piccirillo 1997:394). The site of Dhiban (biblical Dibon) is strategically located between the Wadi Wala and the Wadi Mujib, along the impor- tant north-south "King's Highway" and a lesser-known east-west route. Despite Egyptian references to Dibon, it has produced no LBA remains. The site, home of the Iron II The fortification system at Tall al-cUmayri is the earliest example known from the Iron Age period. Despite the addition of this fortification to an already steep rim, the settlement at this end of the tell suffered a massive and fiery military destruction around 1150 BCE.

It may have possessed a sanctuary, as suggested by the discovery of a ter- racotta stand similar to one from contemporary Beth-Shean (Geraty and Willis 1986:28; Dearman 1992:65; Tushingham 1997:157). The Wadi Mujib marks the effective southern border of Moab, although its territory may have extended as far south as Wadi Hasa (Bienkowski 1992a:1). A string of fortresses or administrative centers combined with the wadi's natural for- midable terrain to ward off intrusion from the south. They include the sites of 'Aracir, Lehun, Kh. al-Baluc, Kh. Medeinet al-Mucarradieh, and Kh. Medeinet cAliya. There is still some debate as to whether-or which of-these fortresses were constructed in the late thirteenth or early twelfth centuries, and not all sites have been fully excavated. What seems clear is that they remained functional throughout the Iron I and the Iron II. 'AraCir (biblical Aroer) is located southeast of Dhiban. The site is strategically located on the northern rim of the Mujib and is associated with a roadway that crosses the 112 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="44">Iron I architectural remains from Tall al- 'Umayri include (at left in the photo) a domestic shrine with its offering table and standing stone and (to its right) a very well preserved pillared house with extensive areas of flagstone pavement.

This road connects 'Ara'ir with the site of al-Balu', on the south rim of the Mujib, and al-Balu' with Lehun (Dearman 1992:70). The fortress of the end of the LBA spans the transition from the end of the LBA II into the early Iron I (Olavarri 1997:177-78; but see Dearman 1992:70 for an initial date of the twelfth century). The 'Ara'ir settle- ment served to control north-south traffic on the Moabite plateau, beginning in the late thirteenth or early twelfth cen- tury BCE. To its east is the site of Lehun. Its history in the LBA/Iron I parallels that of 'Ara'ir (Dearman 1992:70). People occupied the site from late in the LBA II through the Iron I. The Iron I village included residential complexes, some with four- room houses. Pottery and artifacts underscore the agricultural nature of the community, while a Twentieth Dynasty scarab suggests some lingering Egyptian contact. A fortress stood on the site, evidently subsequent to the abandonment of the village late in the Iron I (Homes-Fredericq 1992:198-200; Homes-Fredericq 1997:340; Miller 1997a:199). The site of al-Balu' is on a tributary of the Mujib, south of 'Ara'ir. Recent work at the site suggests the presence of an Iron II fortress, but Iron I levels have not been reached (Worschech, Rosenthal and Zayadine 1989:111-12). How- ever, Crowfoot's exploration of the site in the 1930s indicated an Iron I occupation. In addition, the iconography on the unprovenanced al-Balu' Stele suggests an early twelfth cen- tury setting. It seems reasonable to assume that, like 'Aracir and Lehun, al-Balu' served as a fortress and administrative center in the Iron I (Dearman 1992:70-71). 'Ara?ir, al-Balu', and Lehun were linked by their strate- gic locations along the Mujib, and each functioned as a fortified administrative post controlling traffic across the wadi and into Moab (Dearman 1992:65, 70-71). The shasu chieftan represented on the al-Balu' Stele may indicate the popula- tion against whom the more settled indigenous elements in Moab, along with the Egyptians, erected these defenses. The fortresses at Kh. Medeinet al-MuCarradieh and Kh. Medeinet 'Aliya sat some five kilometers apart on Wadi al- Lejjun, a southern tributary of the Wadi Mujib. LBA II remains appeared at both sites, and in the Iron I, they served defen- sive functions. A defensive wall protected the Iron I city at Kh. Medeinet al-MuCarradieh, the northern of the two sites. Like at Tall al-'Umayri, the construction of the wall included a dry moat (Clark 1994:142). Pillared buildings at Medeinet al-Mu'arradieh and Medeinet 'Aliya resemble the classic four-room house. Collared-rim storejars indicate food storage needs. Even so, these two sites seem to have been only sparsely or seasonally occupied, since housing within the fortresses was minimal. Isolated in location, neither sits along an important roadway, and in this way they do not resemble the fortresses which presented a line of defense to their northwest on the Mujib. Perhaps they served as shel- ter for pastoralists in the region in times of external threat and otherwise remained unoccupied (Dearman 1992:71-72; Miller 1997a:199-202; fn. 6).

L r' Il I 3"kC _1 ?-? r r tL) . ?, r</page><page sequence="45">Moab: Summary Moab was sparsely settled in the LBA, but a significant increase in settled sites began late in that period. The con- tinuum of development, and the transition from pastoralism to farming, reached its peak in the Iron II and later (Miller 1992:80). The early construction of small strategically located fortresses underscores unrest in the region and suggests ele- ments of regional authority and communal organization. However, their presence does not presuppose an orga- nized state ruled by a single king (contra the biblical descriptions; Num 21:26; 22:4; Miller 1997b:38). The Iron Age proliferation of new sites in Moab suggests a slow process of sedentarization. This is reflected not only in the settlements themselves but also in the pottery, which became increasingly plentiful from the LBA through the Iron Age II (Dearman 1992:69-70). The proliferation of large store- jars, in particular the collared-rim pithoi, underscores the ability of the Iron I settlers to farm successfully and to raise surplus crops. The traditional tells of Moab become increasingly infre- quent as one moves south. In fact, as we will see, they are not a factor at all south of the Wadi Hasa. The fortified sites of the Iron I were limited in number and basically served to separate northern Moab from the sparsely occupied cen- tral plateau. Neither the tells nor the fortresses provided housing for the majority of Moab's population. This suggests the constant presence of pastoralists and signifies their ter- ritorial domain, as well (Dearman 1992:73). Both textual and archaeological evidence suggest their underlying tribal orga- nization (Younker 1997). Moab's natural boundaries, fortified borders, growing number of settlements, heightened ability to raise foodstuffs, increasing socioeconomic complexity, and exposure to out- side groups all combine to make it a prime location for the development of political unity. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence does not support the suggestion of an Iron I monar- chy. Rather, the monarchy of the Iron II can be considered an outcome of Iron I developments. Edom The territory of Edom extends from the Wadi Hasa (biblical Zered) in the north to the Wadi Hisma, or even to the Red Sea, in the south. Its terrain-rugged, mountain- ous and increasingly arid as one moves south-is bounded on the west by the Wadi Arabah and on the east by expan- sive desert. In contrast to the virtual absence of LBA sites in Edom, surveys in Wadi Hasa have revealed several small Iron I set- tlements. They were concentrated along the western portion of its southern bank, on the best agricultural land available (MacDonald 1994:240). Pillared houses were found at Khirbat Abu Banna and Khirbat Mashmil (Sauer 1986:10). The Wadi el-Hasa Survey suggests a limited number of small Iron I settlements in northernmost Edom, on the viable farm- land of the Wadi Hasa (Bienkowski 1992a:8-9, fn. 8; Lapp 1994:217). Again, caution must be applied when drawing conclusions from survey materials. Not enough is known An unfortified village during the Iron Age I, Tall Hisban offered to its excavators only limited remains of the LBA. The absence of LBA remains has led historical geographers to question the site's identification with the biblical Heshbon. Photograph courtesy of R. Cleave. about the sites to conclude that they were permanently rather than seasonally inhabited (Hart 1992:94-95). In the southern Ghors and northeast Arabah, as far south as Wadi al-Ghuweib, the situation was somewhat differ- ent. Surveys revealed diverse Iron I sites such as cemeteries, encampments, and smelting sites. These include Kh. al-Nahas (Site 159), Kh. al-Ghuweib (Site 161), and Kh. al-Jariyeh (Mac- Donald 1983:20; MacDonald 1992:140-41). Al-Sila, northwest of Buseirah, also contained Iron I materials (MacDonald 1994:242). Indeed, in all of Edom the heaviest concentra- tion of Iron I sites existed in Wadi al-Ghuweib (Bienkowski 1992b:140). Despite the need for caution when drawing con- clusions from survey materials, it seems that twelfth century mining operations in the Arabah, including those at Timna, were related to the last years of Egyptian influence in the region (Dornemann 1983:168; Bartlett 1989:81). The presence of metals at Tell es-Sa'adiyeh and Tell Mazar indicate that miners and smelters produced copper and bronze for local as well as for foreign consumption (Dornemann 1983:168). Elsewhere in Edom, excavations at important sites includ- ing Buseirah (its capital in the Iron II), Tawilan, Umm el-Biyara, Ghrareh, Feifa, and Tall al-Kheleifeh demonstrate a lack of sedentary occupation prior to the seventh century (Hart 1992:93-97; Bienkowski 1992b:110; MacDonald 1994:237). Indeed, our evidence for Iron I settlement in Edom comes from surface surveys rather than from stratified excavations, and it may even be that much that has been identified as Iron I actually dates to the Iron II (Hart 1992:97; Bienkowski 1992c; contra Finkelstein 1992a; 1992b; Sauer 1986). Edom: Summary Prior to the Iron I, Edom supported primarily a pas- toral population. As noted above, the shasu of Edom were sufficiently important to have been mentioned in Egyptian records and to have provided a source of conflict as late as 114 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="46">the tenth century. The settled population of Iron I Edom lim- ited itself to small farming villages in the north, villages that may have been seasonally occupied. Miners worked copper deposits in the south, perhaps in response to lingering Egypt- ian need. No urban center of the Iron I has been identified. In the Iron I, pastoralists inhabited Edom, although some were developing their skills as farmers. Despite scattered Late Bronze and Iron I settlement in its north, Edom remained largely pastoral until the eighth-seventh centuries. The biblical stories of a mighty nation in Edom during the time of Israelite conquest and settlement are nothing more than that-stories. Transjordan: Conclusions In those parts of Transjordan that had experienced the wealth and cosmopolitan influences created by Egyptian control in LBA-such as the Jordan Valley-the insularity and lower standard of living typical of the Iron I provided a sharp contrast (Domemann 1983:183; McGover 1987:267). Elsewhere, in those regions that had lacked LBA occupation, the Iron I consisted of small agrarian settlements on good cultivatable land, strategically located fortresses designed to control movement across major trade routes, a limited num- ber of Egyptian-inspired mining settlements, and the encampments of pastoralists. To some degree, the Iron I pottery of Transjordan shows continuity with that of the LBA. Probably, the transition from the LBA to the Iron Age was relatively peaceful, a socioeco- nomic transformation by indigenous people, one which would account for both cultural or technological continuity and change (McGovern 1987:267). The overall absence of wide- spread destruction at the end of the LBA (while not discounting some regional pockets of destruction) supports this. With the collapse of the LBA city-states and the loss of Egyptian authority, control over technology transferred from the cities to the villages. From the beginning of the Iron Age, the villagers of Transjordan were acquainted with technolo- gies such as metallurgy, pottery-making, stone masonry, plastered cisterns, and terracing. Presumably, the early Iron I move from city to village took place because people lacked the ability to manage economically in the cities, perhaps due to the growing weakness of Egyptian author- ity and the loss of international markets. In consequence, the village became the preferred residence for those who chose agriculture over seasonal migrations with livestock. At the end of the Iron I, however, there was a countervailing move- ment back into cities (McGovern 1987:268-70). Iron I Conclusions The Iron I began as an era of discontinuity and ended much the same way. In the last years of the LBA, huge population movements took place throughout western Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. These migrations disrupted traditional lifeways in many regions and introduced new peoples to the southern Levant. The new rural settlements of the twelfth century resulted partly because of the Canaan- ites' efforts to find new homes in the wake of military disasters. More significantly, however, they reflected the general demise of the LBA city-state system. Egypt had exploited the tra- ditional Canaanite city-states for centuries, and this factor, together with the loss of markets created by the "Crash of 1200," meant that urban life ceased to be a viable alternative for many one-time city-state dwellers. These changes con- tributed to the destabilization of Egypt's empire in south Canaan, though its imperial hold would not fully release until the second century of the Iron I. Given the extraordinary events at the end of the LBA, coupled with the century or more that it took for their con- sequences to be fully actualized, it should be no surprise that throughout the southern Levant, the Iron I was a period of regionally-based accomodation rather than of widespread conformity. This is all the more true because of the enor- mously varied geographic settings into which people settled and the relative isolation of these regions in the absence of powerful external markets, common enemies, or other poten- tially unifying factors. Throughout the Iron I, traditions from earlier times and places were held dear, and it is sometimes possible, there- fore, to identify peoples by their material culture remains and particularly by their pottery. At the same time, shared subsistence technologies characterized sites in widely diver- gent regions, presumably utilized by members of different ethnic groups. A synthesis of Iron I archaeology must bal- ance these two countervailing tendencies. Egypt The Egyptian presence in south Canaan continued well into the second century of the Iron I, as Egypt focussed upon the need to control access to agricultural products and other raw materials in the absence of a Canaanite city-state system that would accommodate its imperial needs. Toward this goal, Egypt retained its presence along the coast. Ironically, the Philistines' great success in acculturation created a new problem for the Egyptians, who soon needed to establish sites along the coast from which they could monitor poten- tial Philistine expansionism. Here, archaeological evidence presents a mirror image of biblical tales of Philistine encroach- ment eastward into the Israelite hill country. Egypt continued to control cities in the Jezreel Valley, ensuring access to that region's agricultural and pastoral bounty and at the same time maintaining its unencumbered passage into the Jordan River Valley. From there, Egypt briefly pursued trade interests to the north. Farther south, Egypt maintained a presence in the Negev Desert, presumably to ensure continued access to the copper mines of the Arabah. The economic stimulus created by these mining operations can be felt at sites in Transjordan where residents used metal objects early in the twelfth century. Evidence for an Egypt- ian presence in Transjordan ended in the mid-twelfth century, perhaps a century prior to Egypt's final withdrawal from ter- ritory west of the Jordan. The Sea Peoples The settlement of Sea Peoples along the Mediterranean coast was an important element in the Iron I. People with Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 115</page><page sequence="47">sophisticated architectural and ceramic techniques, maritime skills, and a familiarity with other Mediterranean lands inhab- ited much of the region. In the north, the skis/ski and the sherdani introduced ashlar masonry and Phoenician Bichrome ware. Their influence was felt throughout the Haifa Bay and into the Jezreel Valley. The revitalization of the region in the eleventh century can be attributed to the prosperity brought about by their maritime ventures. In the south, the plst/Philistines prospered throughout the Iron I and beyond. Their initial settlements were char- acterized by the presence of Monochrome pottery (Myc IIIc:lb), by Aegean building styles, and by religious and other artifactual elements. They soon took on characteristics of the local population as well, and their pottery developed into Bichrome ware. The Philistines' efforts at expansion met with general success, despite Egyptian attempts to check their growth by the construction of strategically placed settlements. Expansion to the southeast resulted in a Philistine pres- ence in some northern Negev sites. Lured by the same abundance that had earlier drawn Egyptians to the Jezreel Valley, traders soon moved to the northeast; Philistine goods have been documented in the Beth-Shean and Jordan River Valleys. Since Egypt continued to hold the military upper hand in the northern valleys, the Philistine move to the northeast may be seen as motivated by economic rather than territorial desires. Their need for land seems to have become more pressing later, however, for the Bible describes a long sequence of battles fought to protect Israelite territory from Philistine incursions. Demographics Sites of the Iron I can be categorized into those that showed continuity from the LBA II into the Iron I and those that were founded anew in the twelfth century. In addition, the ques- tion of site destruction or abandonment by the end of the Iron I is important. At the beginning of the Iron I, settlement concentrated in regions inhabited in LB II: the more fertile parts of the cen- tral highlands, Philistia, the Shephelah, the Jezreel, Beth-Shean and Jordan Valleys, and in Moab. Settlers established new sites in the Galilee, the Sharon Plain, and in northern Judah later in the twelfth century. Few sites were established in southern Judah. In the Negev where conditions were harsh, settlement did not intensify until the eleventh century. The settlement of the Jezreel and Beth-Shean Valleys was a function of the dynamics of Egyptian-Canaanite relations, as sites with a strong Egyptian presence remained occupied from the LBA into the twelfth and even the eleventh century. However, this area saw no new sites. The Jordan River Val- ley and central Transjordan experienced a peaceful LBA 1-Iron I transition. Newly founded sites were located alongside those with LBA antecedents; here, access to water for farm- ing was critical. In this area, some Iron I sites continued in use in the Iron II, while others met with destruction before the end of the eleventh century. Iron I sites in Ammon exhib- ited continuity with those of the LBA, but elements of Iron I material culture also point to change. In Moab, the number Lehun, located on the northern rim of the Wadi al-Mujib, boasts an Iron Age fortress and well-preserved remains from the LBIIb-lron I transition (foreground). Photograph courtesy of Homes Fredericq. of sites increased, particularly in the north, where tell sites were settled. Southern Moab was only sparsely occupied; the construction there of strategically located fortresses, aban- doned late in the Iron I, points to unrest as well as to some regional authority. The abandonment of sites in the central highlands on both sides of the Jordan began in the late twelfth century and became more widespread in the eleventh century. While res- idents deserted many sites in Judah, Manasseh, and Ephraim in the late-twelfth or early-eleventh centuries, some resettled in the mid-eleventh through the tenth centuries. Economy In the absence of great international markets, most set- tlements of the Iron I were self-sufficient, combining small-scale agriculture with animal husbandry. However, as can be expected, regional variations abounded. The villages of the Upper Galilee were essentially self- supporting, although proximity to Tyre may have had some impact. Imported collared-rim storejars at Dan suggest long-distance contacts, while the locally produced jars under- score continuity with LBA traditions. Tyrian and Galilean storejars, along with the collared-rim jars from Dan, indicate the production of food surpluses. In the Lower Galilee, most 116 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="48">villages were self-reliant, combining animal husbandry with dry farming. However, those sites exhibiting continuity from the LBA had more complex economic structures. The Sharon Plain and Haifa Bay sites participated in a maritime-based economy, which included the importation of Cypro-Phoenician pottery. Fishing was important; Acco's excavators discovered fishers' huts complete with fishhooks, net weights, and turtle shells. Agricultural success was also important, as revealed by the silos and granaries found at that same site. Evidence for copper smelting and the production of dyes is also noteworthy. The Jezreel Valley was important as a major producer of agricultural products, in particular grains and olives. Sev- eral sites had olive oil installations and a cuneiform tablet from Ta'anach highlights trade in grain. Collared-rim storejars turned up at several sites. The presence of a wealthy elite, both foreign and local, underscores the success of the Jezreel economy. The hamlets of the central highlands were commonly self- sustaining, their economy based upon a combination of small-scale farming, herding, and stock-breeding. Wheat and barley were the primary grain crops, but horticulture and viticulture were also important. Planting took place on ter- raced hillsides and in valleys. The towns and villages, particularly those in Manasseh and northern Ephraim that were located along valley perimeters, roadways, or at valley junctures, may have participated in a redistributive econ- omy, as crop surpluses traveled from the valleys to less productive regions. In more isolated settings, villagers subsisted upon what they could raise. Plaster-lined pits and collared-rim storejars held any surpluses. Pottery was pro- duced and used locally, and was largely utilitarian. Few ceramic imports have been found. Several bronze workshops provide the only evidence for craft specialization. The sites of Philistia and the Shephelah became large and prosperous, thanks to a successful agriculturally-based econ- omy. Along with the typical grains, grapes and wine, olives and olive oil, and fish (at coastal sites) were important food staples. Maritime trade was likely, and overland trade along the coast and inland was important. Produce moved from the western Negev basin to the Philistine heart- land for consumption and redistribution. Seals at Philistine sites suggest economic complexity, as do the many special- ized ceramic forms. Beautiful Philistine pottery is, of course, found in Pentapolis and other Philistine sites. Its presence elsewhere testifies to its appeal in broader markets. The Negev economy depended upon mixed farming and herding. Pits and silos illuminate agricultural successes, while enclosed common areas at many sites suggest the sheltering of livestock and the storing of provisions. Trade was also important, as the mix of Philistine, Midianite, Phoenician, Egyptian, and Negebite wares at Tel Masos demonstrates. Agriculture in the Jordan Valley and elsewhere in Trans- jordan became increasingly important. As pastoralists turned to farming, their success strengthened their ties to the land. The proliferation of large storejars, including collared- rim jars, in Ammon and Moab points to the successful pro- duction of crop surpluses. In the Jordan Valley and Ammon, metalworking, including the production of iron, bronze, and copper implements, intensified early in the Iron I. While some metal goods found a use locally, long-distance trade and for- eign involvement fueled the market. Mines in the Arabah provided the raw materials. Architecture Architecture is a good indicator of social structure and complexity, of the degree of wealth, of technological imperatives, and of the relative popularity of tradition over and against innovation. City walls protected some large sites, and residents constructed several fortresses in Moab, but fortifications were in no way typical of the Iron I. The few fortified cities of the twelfth-eleventh centuries were scat- tered throughout the region. These limited urban defenses suggest an era of tranquility, but that is belied by the many disrupted or destroyed sites of the Iron I. The highlanders' decision to build settlements on isolated hilltops may reflect defense needs. In addition, the positioning of some Negev and highland housing, laid out to enclose settlements, may have served the dual need for defense and for a protected common space for securing livestock. Some sites offer additional evidence for town planning. Houses were sometimes arranged in rows or blocks, par- ticularly at sites with Sea Peoples connections. Archaeologists uncovered public buildings at a number of sites, particularly in the Jezreel Valley and in Philistia. Sometimes, larger build- ings were Egyptian Governors' residencies. In contrast, the villages of the central highlands and the Galilee were note- worthy for their lack of large public structures. Elite housing appeared at a number of sites, particularly in Philistia, while the villages of the central highlands and the Galilee contained relatively small residences. In fact, the basic domestic structure of the Iron I was the three- or four-room pillared house. Houses of this type were found in many areas, including the central highlands, the coastal plain, the Negev Desert, and Moab. In form, they were distinct from LBA housing and reflected the needs of the average family of subsistence farmers in the various regions in which they were found. Religion Religion in the Iron I reflected Bronze Age precedents, both for the indigenous people of southern Canaan and for the new immigrant populations. As seen in the myriad small places of worship from this period, the populace still hon- ored ancient traditions, biblical attestations notwithstanding. Sites occupied from the LBA into the Iron Age gener- ally contained the larger of the Iron I religious structures. The Twin Temples at Beth-Shean housed intriguing cultic objects redolent with Canaanite religious imagery. The Temple of Baal Berith at Shechem likewise reflected Canaanite tradi- tions. Archaeologists found smaller sanctuaries in village set- tings in the Galilee (Hazor) and the Jezreel Valley (Tel Qiri). Here too, nothing in the cultic assemblages indicates Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 117</page><page sequence="49">new religious traditions. Indeed, the LBA statue of a god found in the Hazor sanctuary suggests that, even if the settlers of the Iron I city were Israelites (as indicated by the Bible), they were \ comfortable iterating long-standing local cultic behaviors. In the central highlands, excavators have uncov- ered only a few sacred sites. They include both the A A coc domestic (Raddana) and the open-air (Bull Site) end of th types. Here too, religious imagery was Canaanite twelfth c (Bull Site), although biblical tradition suggests an collared- Israelite population. A possible prohibition against pottery f the consumption of pig, demonstrated by a supportir comparison of animal bone remains at highland highland and other Iron I sites, might be used to argue for Excavatic early distinctive Israelite religious beliefs. Jerusaler Sea Peoples' sanctuaries have been uncovered at several sites.

Three-roomed buildings at Tall es-Sacidiyeh and Tall al-Mazar were used for worship from the mid-eleventh century into the tenth century. A domes- ) X tic shrine was uncovered at Tell al-cUmayri, while a ceramic stand from Tall Dhiban suggests the presence of an as yet undiscovered shrine at that site. Israelite Origins Stripping away later Deuteronomic additions, the biblical record suggests the growth of early Israel in three phases of settlement and conflict. Israelites ini- tially settled in the northern highlands, where no battles were necessary. The first period of expansion entailed spo- _ radic conflicts against the Canaanites, peoples of perceived ethnic difference, in the central and southern highlands and in Galilee. Only three battles are detailed in the Joshua account: the ambush and burning of Ai (Josh 7:2-8:23), the battle at Gibeon against a southern Amorite coalition of forces from Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish and Eglon (Josh 10:5-11); and a northern battle by the Waters of Merom against a multi-national force led by Jabin king of Hazor (Josh 11:1-14). During the period of the Judges, Israelite tribes were sufficiently well estab- lished in the highlands to form shifting military alliances and to fight for territory in Philistia to the west, the fertile Jezreel Valley to the north, and Ammon and Moab to the east. Deborah and Gideon both fought battles in the Jezreel Val- ley (Judg 4, 5, 6:11-7:25). Ehud fought against the Moabites )kir he t :en rir :orn ng Is. f ons n.

Settle- |^ '.~ ~ ments declined in ~jl t^ ~ number moving south into Judah '[ X;|\ ~ and north into the Galilee. The _&amp;.. . .f`M~ _j Judahite and Galilean settle- ments tended to be more isolated, at higher and therefore more easily defensible elevations, suggesting that security was a deter- mining factor in site location in those regions. With highland settlement well under way, Megiddo, Taanach, Shechem, and Lachish met with destruction in the middle to late twelfth century. There is no easy reconstruction of the Israelite conquest and settlement based on combined archaeological and bibli- cal evidence. Were it not for the Bible, no late thirteenth-early twelfth century Israelite invasion would be suspected. For the most part, language, dress, pottery, architecture, and cul- tic features demonstrate continuity from the LBA into the Iron Age. Early "Israelite" access to perennial water sources 118 Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999)</page><page sequence="50">necessitated a working relationship with the autochthonous population. While towns and cities were destroyed in the appropriate period, they do not necessarily correspond to the cities allegedly destroyed by the "Israelites." In addition, no one can prove that the "Israelites" were the agents of destruction. Cities prominently mentioned in the biblical account, such as Jericho and (Ai, were not even settled in the period preceding the new Iron I settlements. Neither of these sites has produced an appropriate destruction level. The con- quest of Canaan by a unified "Israel" as described in Joshua 2-12 is unsubstantiated. The bulk of the archaeological evi- dence points to small-scale, peaceful settlement both in the vicinity of LBA Canaanite sites and in more remote regions. The biblical authors of the Iron II may have chosen to empha- size conflict in order to legitimate monarchical territorial acquisition. Similarly, they may have co-opted past and con- temporary destructions, attributing them to early Israelites as a means of creating a national history. Rather than adopt a single model or force a single expla- nation to account for the complex archaeological and textual evidence of Iron I settlement, we adopt a more nuanced approach. Based on archaeological remains, the dramatically increased settled central highland population consisted of indigenous former pastoralists and relocated agrarian "out- siders" from the Late Bronze and Iron Age "Canaanite" city-states. This population was augmented by individuals from the coastal and adjacent lowland regions and from the north (as evidenced by material culture connections) and perhaps by nomadic groups from the east (as described in the Bible). Initial settlement appears to have been peaceful, as evidence of widespread destruction is lacking. The ear- liest settlers employed LBA language, ceramic forms, building plans, and agrarian implements and technologies. They set- tled in fertile valleys and in regions not easily farmed. The lack of uniformity in cultic practices (other than pos- sible obedience to a dietary law prohibiting pork consumption) makes it impossible to demonstrate Israelite ethnicity on the basis of shared sacred structures or paraphernalia. The Book of Judges attests to a variety of religious practices, most of which were not part of the later Iron II Deuteronomic cult. Sacred sites mentioned in biblical texts describing this era include shrines, high places, altars, and trees. Excavated sacred sites of the Iron I are generally consistent with those descriptions preserved in the Book of Judges. Is there archaeological evidence of Israelite ethnic affili- ation? The Memeptah Stele stands as testimony to the existence of an "Israel" at the end of the thirteenth century, even if the precise identity of that Israel is uncertain. Whether the res- idents of those cities that were occupied continuously from the LBA into the Iron Age considered themselves "Israelites" or whether they retained a "Canaanite" identity is currently impossible to determine. Elsewhere, regional and even tribal unity may have been fostered among the discrete geographic territories of the Iron I, each with its unique social and economic adap- tations. In particular, proximity and the possibility of economic integration may have facilitated the development of a shared ideology among the settlers of Manasseh's villages. Final Thoughts From the amalgam of regional variations, disparate pop- ulation groups, and alternate economies that were so typical of the centuries of the Iron I came the many intriguing nations of the Iron II Levant. The settlers of the twelfth-eleventh cen- tury faced many obstacles, obstacles produced by isolation, rugged terrain, subsistence difficulties, past exploitation, migration and immigration, cultural differences, competi- tion, and hostility. Despite-or perhaps on account of-these many impediments to easy unification, people within each major geographic region were ultimately able to forge national identities in the ensuing period.

New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997 More recent excavation reports and secondary sources are cited in the text. Our discussion does not include all known Iron I sites. The most sig- nificant sites are discussed in the text. Additional sites and surveys are listed by region for further research. Excluded from our discussion, too, are Phoenician and Aramaean sites, for they fall outside of the geographic boundaries of this work. Many thanks to William G. Dever, Mark S. Smith, and J.P.

Notes 1 The years from 1200-1000 BCE may be described from the archaeologi- cal or the biblical point of view, and each perspective has its own terminology. In biblical terms, it was the period of Conquest and Settlement, when the people of Israel came to live in their Promised Land. The biblical authors described the area as populated with numerous peoples includ- ing Canaanites, Amorites, Girgashites, Hivites, Jebusites, and Philistines. The archaeologist, on the other hand, calls this period the Iron I (or Early Iron Age), and identifies regional cultures, such as those of the Cen- tral Highlands, the Galilee, the Negev and the Coastal Plain. In general, archaeological terminology will be employed in the archaeological sec- tions of the article, and biblical designations will be used in textually-based discussions. "Canaan" is used as a general designation for the southern Levant, roughly corresponding to modern-day Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian territories. 2 The "revisionist" position is largely ignored in this discussion as it dis- misses archaeological evidence as an historical source. See Dever 1996 and 1998a for a polemical rebuttal. 3 For an excellent survey of the Iron II, see Herr 1997 4 Ethnic affiliation is defined here as the social identity of individuals who conceive of themselves as related through common ancestry, real or fic- titious, and are so regarded by others. Features commonly argued to reflect ancient ethnic groups include language, pottery and other elements of Near Eastern Archaeology 62:2 (1999) 119</page><page sequence="51">Iron Age 3 6 1 [ 11 1.
