From Greek  animal, plant, and anthropomorphic supports, such  fanciful hybrids were invented by Roman artists; the  most elaborate arrangement includes a feline foot  and limb topped with a ruff of leaves and a zoomor- phic or anthropomorphic figure, often an Amor or  Dionysiac character.15 Marble and bronze examples  have been found throughout the empire. Among  the most graceful is a four-legged table support from  Pompeii with attenuated lion feet, acanthus crowns,  and little satyr children cradling pet rabbits (fig. 9);  sturdier-looking supports are more common (fig.  10).16 Several specimens come from Corinth, includ- ing a three-legged table found west of Room C in  the South Stoa in 1934, with light yellow marble legs  topped with panther heads and a porphyry top.17  Numismatic art provides many other examples, for  especially when agonistic prize tables proliferated in  the coinage of the Roman East in the late second and  Fig. 8.

In rare cases, a figure might cross a conceptual line,  becoming Agon himself, the spirit or personification  of competition.54 Pausanias (5.20.2, 5.26.3) recognized  two classical images of Agon at Olympia, but few oth- ers are securely identified. Inscriptions and context  would always have been key. For example, on coins  minted at Nikaia and Ankyra during the reign of Ca- racalla (r. 211–217 C.E.), the enthroned Agon, his  name inscribed, holds out a prize crown or palm with  his right hand, while a vase rests at his feet.55 Opinions  differ now (probably as in antiquity) on whether the  image of a standing autostephanoumenos, captioned  “ΙΕΡΟC ΑΓΩΝ,” on another Nikaian issue personifies  sacred competition, for its legend also appears on  types bearing other symbols of the games.56 In other  cases, even without an inscription, the context justifies  the identification. At least two examples come from  Aphrodisias. On a sarcophagus from the third quarter  of the third century C.E., a winged Agon holds out a  wreath with his left hand.57 And among the reliefs of  the Sebasteion in Aphrodisias, Agon is personified as  a nude youth who wears a crown and cradles a palm  in the crook of his arm while observing a wrestling  match beside a prize table.58  A final example brings us back to specifically Co- rinthian imagery. It is a gilded silver cup from the  first century C.E., probably made in Italy and found  in Berthouville, France (fig. 14).59 In high relief, a  triumphant youth struts along in the company of a Fig. 14.
