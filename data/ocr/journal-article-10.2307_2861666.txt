<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exhibition Review: The Genius of Venice by DAVID ROSAND The Genius of Venice I1o5-I600, the grand exhibition held at the Royal Academy of Arts from November 25, i983, to March II, i984, transformed the London season, as one brochure an- nounced, into "A Venetian Winter." Notwithstanding the strong competition of the British Museum's exhibition of Raphael draw- ings, all London seemed filled with enthusiasm for the Queen of the Adriatic, an enthusiasm that manifested itself on every level of cul- ture consumption and tourism: from gondolier shirts, carnival masks, and tins of baicoli to concerts of Venetian music, programs of films set in the lagoon, and public lecture series on topics such as "Venice: Art and Culture" and "Venice and the Victorians"; and, not least important in setting the tone of the occasion, special travel pack- ages guaranteed the presence of large numbers of live Venetians in the British capital (the show was sponsored by the Sea Containers Group and Venice Simplon-Orient-Express Limited). 1 With a kind of forbearing noblesse, the exhibition itself put up with all this, standing well above the hoopla it generated by virtue of its own extraordinary achievement. The Genius of Venice was impres- sive in every way, for the scope and intelligence of its organization as well as for the quality, quantity, and variety of the works of art on view. Celebrating what is generally acknowledged to be the golden age of Venetian art, the exhibition included paintings (I47 cata- logued, although not all were finally sent to London), drawings (84 items), prints (63, although not all arrived), and sculpture (42 ob- jects); in addition there were prints, manuscripts, documents, and maps illustrating aspects of Venetian history, politics, and civic ritual (i9 items). Together, these filled fifteen galleries of the Royal Acad- emy, offering the visitor a breathtaking panorama of the Venetian Cinquecento, highlighted by masterpieces rarely seen, the most no- table being Sebastiano del Piombo'sjudgment of Solomon from Kings- ton Lacy and Titian's Flaying of Marsyas from Kromeii, Czechoslo- vakia. The presence of such works testified to the diplomatic skills of I The Genius of Venice iyoo-I6oo, catalogue edited by Jane Martineau and Charles Hope, Royal Academy of Arts (London, i983; published in association with Weiden- feld and Nicolson). [ 290 ]</page><page sequence="2">THE GENIUS OF VENICE 291 the organizers, especially J. R. Hale, chairman of the steering com- mittee and the guiding spirit of the enterprise. The range of works exhibited, in turn, attested to the ambitious scope and purpose of the project: "to demonstrate the close and mutually enriching interrela- tionship in the arts between Venice and its mainland empire." A number of graphic images of the Serenissirna greeted the visitor in the first gallery, Jacopo de' Barbari's bird's-eye View of Venice dominating. That monumental woodcut, printed from six blocks in I500 "for the fame of this exceedingly noble city," fittingly initiated the exhibition: invoking Mercury and Neptune as patrons of the prosperous republic, de' Barbari's design inaugurated a new kind of Olympian iconography that would become one of the major themes of Venice's self-presentation in the course of the Cinquecento. Juergen Schulz, in the most important study of this great print, rec- ognized it as "a visual metaphor for the Venetian state like the famil- iar symbols of Venice, the winged Lion of Saint Mark and the female figure holding the scales and sword ofJustice, which represent the divinely protected and justly governed Republic. "2 In the catalogue of The Genius of Venice (cat. no. Hi), David Chambers, taking a rather narrow view of the image and finding in it an "overall impres- sion of desertion and inactivity," questions the validity of Schulz's reading without, however, offering any alternative interpretation. The result is that the rhetorical intention of the installation of the woodcut in the show-as well as of its original publication, for it was given special tax exemption by the Venetian government-is actu- ally undermined by the catalogue entry. (It should be noted that the original woodblocks for this print are still extant, preserved in the Museo Correr in Venice, and in need of conservation: they continue to be eaten away by tarli). The second gallery at the Royal Academy followed the expansion of the Venetian empire onto the terraferma. Carpaccio's Lion of St. Mark, stepping ashore from the bacino, symbolized that territorial ad- vance. Painted in I5 i6, this canvas dates from that critical period in the history of Venice, the very year in which, by the Treaties of Noyon and Brussels, Venice regained the mainland territories it had lost so swiftly to the forces of the League of Cambrai only eight years 2Juergen Schulz, "Jacopo de' Barbari's View of Venice: Map Making, City Views, and Moralized Geography Before the Year 1500, " Art Bulletin, 6o (I 978), 425-474.</page><page sequence="3">low. __r- __ Figure i.

Here too, then, the organizers of The Genius of Venice very effectively acknowledged and revived the traditional resonance of Venetian political iconography-although the catalogue entry itself (cat. no. 32) remained silent on the fuller historical context of the painting.3 This same gallery recalled Venice's maritime prowess in a series of representations of the naval victory at Lepanto (I 57I), a final moment of much celebrated glory-but also a prelude to the contin- uing struggle with Turkish imperial ambitions in the east. Thus instructed by images in the basic outlines of Venetian his- tory, politics, and ceremony (by, for example, prints of the proces- sion of the Doge and of meetings in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio, and illuminated manuscripts and documents), and of empire (maps, plans, sea charts), the visitor proceeded to the primary object of the exhibition, the works of art that most convincingly represented the genius of Venice. Appropriately, one immediately confronted the infamous "Gior- gione problem." The first great Venetian painter belonging essen- tially to the Cinquecento-the total absence here of Giovanni Bellini, who remained a powerful force in the Venetian art world until his death in I 5i6, was understandable-Giorgione was already an enigma in that century. He died young, at the age of 34 according to Vasari, in I5IO. By the end of that opening decade, however, he had revolutionized the art of painting, particularly oil painting. His leg- acy to critics and connoisseurs includes some of the most vexed problems of interpretation and attribution. Vasari was already con- fused on both scores, complaining that no one could explain the meaning of certain of Giorgione's paintings and confessing that he himself was unable to distinguish the artist's hand from that of his followers. Modern scholars dealing with Giorgione, whose person- ality is as penumbral as his art, have had to work from a quite small nucleus of generally accepted pictures; each has had to reconstruct an oeuvre according to his own principles, a situation epitomized by the title of one art historian's effort: "il mio Giorgione" (Giuseppe Fiocco). 3As a strictly art-historical footnote, we might observe here that the wooded out- crop at the left of Carpaccio's canvas derives from that in Titian's design for the wood- cut of the Sacrifice ofAbraham, published by Bernardino Benalio the previous year. Fur- ther on this print, which was catalogued but not exhibited at the Royal Academy, below.</page><page sequence="6">THE GENIUS OF VENICE 293 As Francis Richardson points out in the catalogue, only three ex- tant canvases can be persuasively associated with the works given to Giorgione by sixteenth-century writers: the Three Philosophers in Vi- enna (finished, according to Marcantonio Michiel, by Sebastiano del Piombo), the Sleeping Venus in Dresden (finished by Titian, accord- ing to Michiel), and the Tempesta in Venice. To that fairly well at- tested group can be added the fresco fragments from the Fondaco dei Tedeschi, a documented commission. None of these works was in the exhibition, but the gallery dedicated to "The New Style" was filled with the spirit of Giorgione. The Virgin and Child with St. An- thony and St. Roch from the Prado and the Glasgow Christ and the Adulteress with its related fragment were labelled "Circle of Gior- gione, Attributed to Titian." Despite the results of polls among art historians, some of us still prefer to lean toward the name of Gior- gione. One missed the Concert Champe~tre from the Louvre, which would have sharpened the debate still more. The centerpiece of the room was the Kingston LacyJudgment of Solomon, which, along with two of the organ shutters from S. Bartolomeo a Rialto, well repre- sented the young Sebastiano del Piombo, one of Giorgione's most successful followers. The other of the "due eccellenti suoi creati" (Vasari's words) was, of course, Titian, whose early work provided an essential base against which to gauge the Giorgionismo of the prob- lem pictures. For those of us who respond to the essential classicism of Titian's art, a trait evident from the beginning, the looser struc- tures and tonal volumes of those paintings from the "Circle of Gior- gione" tend to preclude an attribution to Titian. But this is a debate that seems destined to continue, with succeeding generations of art historians repeating the same arguments, even as we wait (without much hope) for the new documentary discoveries that might set the discussion on firmer ground. One of the inspired aspects of the installation of "The New Style" gallery was the inclusion of sculpture. Marble reliefs by Tullio and Antonio Lombardo and Giovanni Maria Mosca and bronze reliefs by Riccio demonstrated that the new pictorial sensibility of the early Cinquecento was not confined to painting. Indeed, the thematic and stylistic classicism of these works comment on, even as they clarify, the suggestive aesthetic of Giorgionismo in painting. The icono- graphic precision of sculpted imagery all'antica adds new poignancy to the affect of the Giorgionesque poesia-most movingly in Tullio Lombardo's Bacchus and Ariadne from Vienna.</page><page sequence="7">294 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY This gallery more successfully than any other created a full cultural ambience, evoking the imagination of a particular epoch and sug- gesting its special qualities. Moving on in the exhibition, the visitor was impressed increasingly by the sheer weight of great paintings. Later sculpture was displayed more or less on its own, without much effort to integrate it into a larger context. Organization and installa- tion of the paintings shifted to emphasize particular categories or genres, especially portraiture (best represented by Titian and Giovanni Battista Moroni), or mainland schools (Bergamo and Bre- scia), or to present small monographic collections of individual art- ists. Lorenzo Lotto was particularly well represented (by 13 paint- ings) in a single gallery, and the full course of Jacopo Bassano's development unfolded in a most intelligent and satisfying selection of eleven canvases. Others of the great Venetian masters fared less well, partly be- cause their work was more dispersed, hung in various sections of the exhibition. Paolo Veronese, for example, was difficult to compre- hend for that reason. One's sense of his achievement was also clouded somewhat by the problem, never adequately addressed in the catalogue, of studio assistance. Most of the successful painters of the Venetian tradition were the heads of large and active family workshops; assistants, usually relatives, were trained, for obvious reasons, to paint in the manner of the master. In several of the Vero- neses in the exhibition-including the Allegory of the Battle of Lepanto-one sensed the intervention of assisting hands. (One other problem disturbing the presentation of Veronese concerns the recent restoration and cleaning of the Venus and Adonis in the Prado: one can only lament the apparently excessive zeal that seems to have stripped the surface of much of its subtlety of chromatic modulation and tonal inflection; Adonis' orange tunic appears now terribly flat and flagrant in color, and the delicately dramatic passage of shadow across the face and body of Venus seems much less effective than one recalls from visits to Madrid.) Similar problems attended a number of the more monumental canvases representing Tintoretto. One welcomed the opportunity to see the version of the Washing of the Feet from Newcastle-upon- Tyne, which Rodolfo Pallucchini published as the original canvas from the Venetian church of S. Marcuola. Many observers, I am sure, will remain unpersuaded by its quality and will continue to re-</page><page sequence="8">THE GENIUS OF VENICE 295 gard this as a workshop replica of the painting in the Prado. A more complex problem is posed by the modello for the Ducal Palace Para- dise from the Thyssen-Bornemisza collection. Here the debate is complicated by iconographic considerations and- this large canvas' relation to the mural painted by Tintoretto and his shop in the Sala del Maggior Consiglio. One cannot but feel that the contextual inter- ests of the Thyssen-Bornemisza modello have diverted attention from some more fundamental questions of connoisseurship. It is hard to accept this picture as wholly byjacopo Tintoretto himself, although that seems to be the tacit assumption of most of the discussants. Not only does the painting appear to be of quite varied quality of execu- tion, it is, more interestingly, a complicated palimpsest of overlap- ping campaigns. The general thickness and exchange of levels of painting and repainting indicate an intensive process of making and correcting; and much of that painting seems unworthy of the master. Stranger still, the clouds supporting the banks of saintly figures as- sume curiously anthropomorphic shapes: nebulous heads and shoul- ders corbel out to sustain those bodies; cumulously muscular arms reach back to offer further buttressing. The effect, quite different from the gossamer angels sanctifying the meal in Tintoretto's Last Supper in S. Giorgio Maggiore, is like nothing else in his art; yet it seems totally unremarked in the growing literature on this recently published canvas. Throughout the exhibition were distributed eighteen paintings by Titian (not including those ascribed to him as "Circle of Gior- gione"), and these ran the entire gamut of his long career. The cen- terpiece of this group-possibly of the entire show-was surely the Flaying ofMarsyas, a masterpiece of Titian's final years that had until now been seen by all too few art historians. Attributed to Titian when it entered the Arundel collection in the early seventeenth cen- tury, the picture has been one of the most discomforting to modern scholars. Theodor Hetzer rejected the attribution, and Erwin Panofsky in the final footnote of his lectures on Titian struggled pub- licly with his doubts: Since I have never seen the original, I do not dare pronounce on the authenticity of the now almost generally accepted Flaying of Marsyas.. . . It is admittedly difficult to attribute this painting to anyone else ... ; but it is equally difficult to accept Titian's responsibility for a composition which in gratuitous brutality (the little dog lapping up the blood) not only outdoes its</page><page sequence="9">296 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY model, one of Giulio Romano's frescoes in the Palazzo del Te at Mantua. but also, and more importantly, evinces a horror vacui normally foreign to Ti- tian who, like Henry James' Linda Pallant, "knew the value of intervals." In the Kromerif picture no square inch is vacant.4 No one seeing the picture at the Royal Academy could harbor any doubt. For most of us the experience was the discovery of a great pic- ture, confirmation of the creative power of the aged Titian's brush. Nor could there be any further doubt about the status of the canvas, whether it was finished or not. For all the magnificent freedom of its brushwork-an organic surface of natural vitality, a convincing tis- sue of structured form that Panofsky misread from reproductions- the Flaying ofMarsyas declares its finish in every way: from the finely realized jewels of the crown of Midas and the delicately edged laurel leaves of Apollo's wreath to the fully satisfying impression made by the whole, the sense of pictorial completion it conveys to the viewer standing at a short distance from it-who shares the experience so perceptively observed by Vasari before Titian's late works: "exe- cuted in bold strokes, broadly applied in great patches, in such a manner that they cannot be looked at closely but from a distance ap- pear perfect." Finally, the Flaying ofMarsyas is signed, presumably a declaration of the painter's own sense of its completion. Despite all this, the catalogue of The Genius of Venice gives out some mixed signals. Giles Robertson's all too laconic entry (cat. no. I 3 2) barely confronts the issue; rather timidly and on essentially icon- ographic grounds, it allows the possibility that the painting may be unfinished. Charles Hope, on the other hand, in his entry on another late canvas, the problematic fragmentary Boy with Dogs in Rotter- dam (cat. no. I28), does not hesitate: The sketchy, impressionistic technique of this picture-and of The Flaying of Marsyas (Cat. 132)-are usually considered typical of Titian's style after about 1570. But the present writer believes that such pictures are unfinished, since they look different from Tarquin and Lucretia (Cat. 130) and St. Jerome in Penitence (Cat. 131 [but not actually in the exhibition]), which Titian sent to Philip II in 157i and I1575 respectively. One can only assume that Hope wrote his entry before seeing the picture. Earlier in the catalogue, in a short essay on "Titian and Ve- 4Erwin Panofsky, Problems in Titian, Mostly Iconographic (New York, i969), p. 171, n. 8 5.</page><page sequence="10">THE GENIUS OF VENICE 297 netian Colour, " John Steer has no trouble in associating the Tarquin and Lucretia and the Flaying ofMarsyas: Vision and expression are here so much one that they cannot, even for the pur- poses of discussion, be separated. But it can, I think, be said that in these paint- ings Titian's intense struggle to grasp in paint, through tone and colour, the physical realities of the scene is a fundamental part of their meaning.5 Such lack of coordination can only leave the reader perplexed. Unfortunately, it is typical and generally spoils the catalogue of The Genius of Venice, which, in its own way, is as ambitious as the exhibi- tion. Handsomely produced and modestly priced, it runs to over 400 pages, illustrates every work, 95 of them in color, and presents itself as a most serious volume.6 Written by an international group of no less than forty-eight contributing scholars, the publication draws upon an impressive range of expertise; one can only imagine that its production was as much a test of diplomatic skills as the realization of the exhibition itself. The book seemed a worthy souvenir of the show, but its very ambition promised more: to articulate and docu- ment the premises of the exhibition, to define the historical and cul- tural contexts in which the works of art were to be seen and under- stood. Indeed, the table of contents proclaims the intention to establish the widest context of appreciation and comprehension. Prefacing the several sections of the catalogue proper are fourteen short essays; eleven of them provide the opening chapters, so to speak, of the book, and their titles suggest the concerns and interests that motivate the project. J. R. Hale's "Venice and its Empire" broadly stakes the territory and is followed by: J. M. Fletcher, "Pa- tronage in Venice"; Lionello Puppi, "Patronage on the Venetian Mainland"; Howard Burns, "Architecture"; Terisio Pignatti, "Al- tarpieces"; Lino Moretti, "Portraits"; Charles Hope, " 'Poesie' and Painted Allegories"; idem, "The Historians of Venetian Painting"; 5Robertson's catalogue entry, typifying a prevalent timidity in response to the chal- lenge of interpretation, ends on a peculiarly lame note: "The figure of Midas is some- times taken as a self-portrait. Neumann and Fehl have probed into the deeper meaning of the picture. " For the most recent critical response to the picture and a vigorous effort to interpret its dimensions of meaning, see S. J. Freedberg, "Titian and Marsyas," FMR [ = Franco Maria Ricci] (September, I984), 52-64. 6At the exhibition, the paperback catalogue cost only ?7.90.

Abrams, Inc., and priced at $37.50- not quite the same bargain.</page><page sequence="11">298 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY John Steer, "Titian and Venetian Colour"; Francesco Valcanover, "Conservation, Restoration, and New Findings"; Francis Haskell, "Venetian Sixteenth-Century Painting-The Legacy. " James Byam Shaw introduces the catalogue of drawings; David Landau writes on "Printmaking in Venice and the Veneto," and the catalogue of sculp- ture is preceded by an essay by Bruce Boucher and Anthony Rad- cliffe. All these apparently promising riches, however, yield disappoint- ing results. The individual essays, which are only about two and a half pages in length, vary enormously in quality and in level of criti- cal and scholarly responsibility. Some, filled with art-historical cli- ches, seem to have been tossed off with little or no regard for the needs or aims of the larger enterprise. Others, apparently anxious to raise new questions, seem frustrated by editorial limitations. With the exceptions of Fletcher's on patronage and Burns' on architecture, not one is really documented; the reader interested in pursuing a topic or in controlling the basis of an author's assertion is left without guidance.7 The long but hardly exhaustive bibliography appended to the volume principally services the catalogue entries; it contains very little on the history and culture of Venice. But even within that strictly art-historical agenda, some of the omissions are particularly glaring. For example, there is no mention at all ofJaynie Anderson's work on Giorgione, surely the most significant recent contribution to our knowledge of that artist. Thus, the Castelfranco altarpiece here continues to be dated confidently "about I504" (p. 29), even though Anderson has deconstructed the loose and wishful reading of the data that had provided the supposed foundation for that date. Her study has opened up the dating of the picture, allowing us to recon- sider its style and the possibility of an earlier moment in Giorgione's brief career, ca. I5oo-OI, which might permit a more convincing chronology of this painter's development.8 7In Burns' essay, a footnote (p. 28, n. 9) to the statement that "cheaper housing de- velopments of Venice anticipate the housing schemes of modern times" refers to "Schulz i982." Unfortunately, no such entry appears in the bibliography. The full ci- tation of this study is: Juergen Schulz, "The Houses of Titian, Aretino, and San- sovino," in Titian: His World and His Legacy, ed.

Francesco Valcanover's brief contribution, "Conservation, Restoration, and New Findings," merely lists some of the paintings that have been treated by the Soprintendenza in Venice since the di- sastrous acqua alta of i966. We are told that restoration has "contrib- uted significantly to our understanding of the development of Vene- tian painting," but we are never quite told how. Our understanding of Titian's development after the death of Giorgione has also been increased through the restoration of his paintings in Venice. Thus we can appreciate better than ever before the extraordinary novelty of the Assump- tion of the Virgin of 5I 8 . . ., which, with its sumptuous colouring, heroic forms and remarkable depiction of emotions, introduced a new type of altar- piece to Venice; while the composition of the Pesaro Altarpiece, finished in 1526 for the same church [the Frari], seems to anticipate the Baroque style of the next century (p. 44). Such generalized art-historical comments are of little use, and the ab- sence of relevant bibliographical references deprives the reader of fur- ther sources of real information-such as Valcanover's own publica- tion of the restoration of the Pesaro Altarpiece, with its quite spectacular and revealing X-rays of the canvas.9 Nor are there any references to the publications ofJoyce Plesters, although her work on Venetian paintings has been reported during the past several years in the National Gallery's readily accessible Technical Bulletin.10 Visitors to the exhibition at the Royal Academy-indeed, to any exhibition- carry with them an understandable curiosity about how works of art are made, properly assuming that technique and style are natural cor- 9Francesco Valcanover, "La pala Pesaro," Quaderni della Soprintendenza ai Beni Ar- tistici e Storici di Venezia, 8 (1979), 57-71 (with technical notes by Lorenzo Lazzarini).

That point was underscored with exceptional eloquence by Titian's Flaying ofMarsyas. Yet there is no effort anywhere in the cat- alogue to deal with questions of medium and technique in painting: quite a serious omission in an exhibition celebrating the effects of Giorgione's revolutionizing of the art of oil painting. The other, related aspect of Giorgione's new style, its affective content, is treated in a curious way by Charles Hope in his deliber- ately provocative essay "'Poesie' and Painted Allegories." Evidently choosing to ignore the full implications of the term poesia and its ap- plication to painted imagery, Hope insists upon dissociating the painter from the culture that sustained him: ". . . scholars have often speculated about the possible influence on Giorgione of conteinpo- rary literature and philosophy, something for which there is virtually no evidence in the surviving historical sources." The suggestiveness, the invitation of Giorgione's new style, the shadowed ambience of softened forms in space and the openness of its technique, all this is severed from any but the most limited art-historical context: But even granted that this high culture might have had some relevance for the subject-matter of his paintings, it is by no means clear why it should have prompted him to adopt a new style-a common enough phenomenon, after all, in the history of art. It is likely that the style came first, and that the subjects were then chosen to display its potential to the full, because in other respects these seem to have little in common with one another (p. 3 5). Innovative artists hardly "adopt" new styles in such a casual way; they create them. Nor are styles simply tools awaiting some appro- priate application. This sense of the sequence of things seems hope- lessly academic, to say the least, and hardly offers a useful model for the study of such a "common enough phenomenon"(!) as the inven- tion of a new style in art. Narrowly reading the few surviving sources-including Marcan- tonio Michiel's inventory-like description of the Tempesta as "the small landscape on canvas with the storm, with the gypsy and the soldier"-and ignoring the poetic literature of the Renaissance (San- nazaro and Bembo, most relevantly), Hope fails to engage either im- agery or style, refusing to acknowledge meaning in any but the most narrowly literal sense. Finally, his argument emerges as pure tautol- ogy: The best evidence, perhaps, that Giorgione's pictures were not particularly esoteric in their meaning is provided by the fact that while his stylistic innova-</page><page sequence="14">THE GENIUS OF VENICE 301 tions were widely adopted, the distinguishing feature of virtually all Venetian non-religious painting in the first half of the sixteenth century is the lack of learned or literary content. The Concert Champe^tre can hardly be discussed without reference to the pastoral tradition as articulated in classical literature and point- edly revived in the Renaissance, yet Hope would deny the relevance of that tradition because he cannot find an archival document to confirm it explicitly. In other studies, not cited here, Hope has been systematically chal- lenging what he would consider Panofskian heresy, purging Vene- tian pictures of any taint of Neoplatonism, or intellectual content at all, and insisting rather on a "straightforward," indeed, positively prosaic reading of these images. Titian's "so-called" Sacred and Pro- fane Love, deprived of any "abstruse ideas of Neoplatonism, may have been a perfectly straightforward celebration of a marriage, showing the bride with Venus." His "so-called" Venus of Urbino "is almost certainly a representation of a mortal woman in a contempo- rary setting, not a goddess," and the proof is that the picture "was described in 1538 by its first owner simply as 'the naked women' " (p. 36). 11 Again, the inventory-like reference-here in a letter from Guidobaldo II della Rovere to his agent in Venice-assumes the sta- tus of iconographic program in Hope's logic. Add to this his con- demnation of the "slightly incoherent" programs of Venetian politi- cal allegory, and Hope's essay becomes a most deceptive guide to the meaning (or, in his view, non-meaning) of paintings in Venice. However salutory as a corrective to the Neoplatonizing excesses of some modern interpreters, Hope's aggressively anti-intellectual at- tack can only lead to an impoverishment of experience and a flatten- ing of history. Without any sense of poetry, his approach is literalis- tic, tied to the randomly preserved word, no matter what its context; it cannot introduce us to the culture that took ut pictura poesis more seriously and generously than we do. Excluding any possibility of genuine cultural history, Hope's narrow positivism threatens to turn the study of art into a trivial pursuit. If the individual essays in The Genius of Venice generally fail to sup- port the presumed intellectual goals of the exhibition, a failure of "These issues are debated in various contributions to Tiziano ' Vlenezia: Convegno Internazionale di Sttdi, Venezia, I976 (Vicenza, i980).</page><page sequence="15">302 RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY overall editorial control seems responsible for still other problems, especially contradictions within the catalogue-such as we encoun- tered in regard to the Flaying ofMarsyas. A well-known signed draw- ing by Domenico Campagnola in the British Museum, for example, is catalogued by David Scrase (cat. no. D7), who writes of this early sheet that it "shows no trace of Titian's influence." A few pages ear- lier, in his introductory essay "Drawing in Venice," Byam Shaw writes of the same drawing: "The earliest of Domenico's landscapes, such as this, are close imitations of drawings by Titian himself' (p. 243). What is the reader to conclude, other than that connoisseurship is a very inexact science, not to say irredeemably subjective? If most of the catalogue entries tend to rehearse opinions and fol- low a rather safe, diplomatic middle road, one section deliberately seeks to revise some standard assumptions. David Landau introduces the prints with an essay marked by a clear passion for the subject. His proselytizing intent, however, leads him to adopt an excessively apologetic tone on behalf of the graphic arts, and his final paragraph sits uneasy within the larger scope of the exhibition: Most of the prints in the exhibition are shown in very early impressions, so that they can be seen as the artists conceived them, and not as they were when reprinted in later editions. This has necessarily involved the exclusion of many prints that could only be found in late impressions. But the final selection of prints for the exhibition was shaped above all by personal taste, with the inten- tion of showing what I consider to be the most beautiful prints produced in Venice and the Veneto in the sixteenth century, irrespective of their historical interest, importance or influence ... 12 Ignoring the announced historical ambitions of the exhibition, he concludes with an invitation of almost disingenuous aestheticism: "I can only hope that the public will enjoy them as much as I did when I chose them" (p. 305). Not surprisingly, then, his catalogue entries scarcely address is- sues of iconography, function, or meaning. This is especially disap- pointing with regard to those monumental woodcuts that were "Subsequently, however, Landau had to modify his selection of "very early im- pressions," admitting that the woodcut by Domenico Campagnola Landscape with St. Jerome and Two Lions exhibited in London (cat. no.

The con- noisseurship of prints, too, is evidently still in an exploratory stage.</page><page sequence="16">THE GENIUS OF VENICE 303 clearly conceived as public statements, such as Titian's Triumph of Christ (a processional image in ten blocks stretching some 2680 mm. in length) and his Submersion of Pharaoh's Army in the Red Sea (a twelve-block image measuring 1225 by 2215 mm.). Landau opens his painfully brief remarks on the latter by hailing it as "arguably the greatest woodcut ever made" (cat. no. Pi9). (Hyperbole aside, I, for one, am ready to concur with this enthusiasticjudgment.) It is there- fore a greater pity that Landau refuses to consider any of the prob- lems surrounding the Red Sea. Published in 1515, its iconography must be considered with regard to the commonplace identification, especially in a time of crisis-such as the war of the League of Cambrai- of the Venetians with the chosen people of Israel: "il pop- ulo tanto da Dio amato," as inscribed on the later edition of the woodcut.13 Given Landau's confessed emphasis on "very early im- pressions," it is hard to understand his silence on the fragment in the Museo Correr, probably the sole surviving piece of the original edi- tion of jj5 14 With respect to the Sacrifice ofAbraham, the third of the multiblock woodcuts associated with Titian, Landau offers a radical reattribu- tion, boldly assigning its design to Giulio Campagnola (cat. no. PI7; this single surviving impression of the first edition, in East Berlin, was not, however, sent to the Royal Academy show). Whatever their merits, the arguments as presented in the catalogue entry de- pend upon a chain of assumptions that takes us back to what must remain a highly hypothetical base: namely, that Domenico Cam- pagnola, Giulio's adoptive son, had direct access to the woodblocks of the Sacrifice. That assumption, in turn, is predicated on Landau's acceptance of Peter Dreyer's thesis that the one preparatory drawing by Titian for this woodcut, the study of trees in the Metropolitan Museum, is actually a forgery built upon a lightly printed counter- proof of the print. "Unfortunately," Landau writes in his essay, "lack of space makes it impossible here either to discuss the question in the detail it deserves or to prove that Domenico Campagnola was the forger. However, I feel I have enough evidence to send Domeni- 13This political theme has been a major interest of recent discussions of the Red Sea. See, e.g., David Rosand and Michelangelo Muraro, Titian and the Venetian Woodcut (Washington, I976), cat. no. 4, and, not cited by Landau, Loredana Olivato, " 'La Summersione di Pharaone'," in Tiziano e Venezia, pp. 529-37. 14Rosand-Muraro, Titian and the Venetian Woodcut, fig.

Unfortunate, in- deed: frustration can be the only response of the reader interested in examining the evidence that so violently condemns poor Do- menico.15 * * * The Genius of Venice was one of those exhibitions that acquire le- gendary status. It was the kind of show, replete with extraordinary treasures borrowed from museums and collectors throughout the world, that we all assumed could never again be mounted. More than a blockbuster, however, it reflected a guiding intelligence and historical vision that sought to present the art in the contexts of its time and place. That the accompanying catalogue, which will now have a life of its own, failed to provide the requisite support is unfor- tunate. Such failure may simply be a function of the scale of the en- terprise, the sheer number and variety of contributors. But it may also reflect upon the more general problem of the exhibition cata- logue, a standard form of publication in art history, as a vehicle for the development and communication of serious ideas. Certainly the reader senses a conflict between the special needs of the occasion and the conventions that reduce most catalogue entries to a sameness, ty- ing them to the limited agenda of questions of attribution, dating, condition, etc., and rendering the form itself inhospitable to serious or sustained discourse. As a volume on Cinquecento Venice, this cat- alogue will hardly become a standard reference. It will remain, how- ever, as a sumptuous souvenir of a grand exhibition.
