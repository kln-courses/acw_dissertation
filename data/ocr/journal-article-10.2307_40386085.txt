<plain_text><page sequence="1">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART IN THE MACDONALD RIVER DISTRICT NEW SOUTH WALES By I. M. Sim1 Summary Λ large sandstone shelter in the Macdonald River district in New South Wales ^*- contains nearly two hundred aboriginal drawings, paintings and stencils. The floor of the shelter is mainly rock. A limited and shallow floor deposit was not excavated. Except for the art, and grinding and percussion marks on the floor, the shelter contains no significant signs of aboriginal occupation. Much of the art is very deteriorated through weathering. Overall, the figures vary considerably in their state of preservation, suggesting a corresponding variation in age. Several figures appear to have been redrawn many times. Superimpositions of figures are common and are complex in some sections of the series. Eighty recorded examples of superimpositions indicated temporal sequences in colour and style which only partly accord with those documented for other sites in South-Eastern New South Wales. Superimpositions in some individual figures enabled identification of the artist's drawing technique. The art is generally typical of the rock shelter art of the Sydney district and, in content and presentation, features some parallels with the rock engravings of that district. In a regional context the series exhibits several quite unusual features, viz. exceptionally large size, inclusion of a wide range of subject matter, and most particularly, inclusion of several large drawings of anthropomorphs and an eel-like creature. Two distinct methods of depiction of large anthropomorphic figures possibly indicate some change in artistic tradition. I suggest that these largest figures in the series parallel in concept the outsize figures found among the rock engravings of the Sydney district, that the eel-like figure probably represents the Rainbow/Water Serpent and that the large anthropomorphs represent superhuman and ancestral beings. On the balance of evidence available, the shelter was probably a ritual centre of some type and more than likely one of considerable significance. THE SITE The Macdonald River is one of the main tributaries of the Hawkesbury River, entering it at Wisemans Ferry, about forty miles north-west of Sydney. Flowing in a generally south-east direction, the Macdonald drains some seven hundred square miles 1 An officer of the State Planning Authority of N.S.W.</page><page sequence="2">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART 145 of the rugged and deeply dissected plateau which lies between the Hawkesbury and the Hunter River valley. Most of the region is typical sandstone plateau country, with narrow rocky ridges, deep, steep-sided valleys and gorges and a dense cover of eucalyptus forest. Rock engravings and cave art in the region have been described and illustrated by several authors.2 Engravings appear to be confined generally to the southern part of the region, while cave art extends further across the plateau, north to the Hunter and Goulburn River valleys and west to the Great Dividing Range. The rock shelter described here is situated in nigged country several miles from the main valley of the Macdonald River. The larger valleys of the lower Macdonald and its tributaries were settled by about 1840. The settlers made as much use as possible of the surrounding plateau country, seeking out any areas sufficiently fertile to provide grazing for cattle. Local aborigines were apparently often used as guides. Somewhere about i860, one of the earliest settlers, James Jurd, ran stock in the small valley in which the rock shelter containing the drawings is located. The initials J. J. appear in the shelter, but Jurd apparently did not mention his find, possibly in respect of the wishes of the local aborigines. His grandson, the late Mr. Ε. Μ. Jurd, also used the valley as grazing ground. He found the shelter about 1920 and in the following thirty years or so, showed it to a few people who were willing to undertake the strenuous task of getting to it. In 1962, although then advanced in years, Mr. Jurd guided the author to the site. The author visited it again three times between 1963 and 1967, spending a total of about eight days recording the drawings and checking the recording. The small valley in which the shelter is located forms part of the headwaters of a creek system. It is a shallow and almost level pocket, about 100 metres across, lying about fifty metres below the ridge top level. Upstream from the shelter it peters out into rough tributary creeks. A few hundred metres downstream it junctions with another gully and then drops away into a steep and rugged gorge. Soils in the valley floor appear to be deep and carry mature open forest, mainly Turpentine, Ironbark, Gum and Forest Oak. Ground cover is fairly dense, mainly Acacia scrub and young Forest Oak, but according to Mr. Jurd, the valley floor was formerly free from scrub and supported a dense growth of native grasses. Among those who used it for grazing stock, the site was noted for its permanent water supply, provided by a spring and a series of rock pools downstream from the shelter, and for its lush natural pasture. According to Mr. Jurd, game species, particularly kanga- roos and wallabies, were common in the area. Some larger animal species such as wallabies and wombats still occur in reasonable numbers. Bird life is plentiful, including larger game species such as lyrebird, wonga and bronzewing pigeon. «Notably Elkin (6), Enright (7-9), Goddard (11), Hammond (12), Macintosh (16), Mathews (38» 40» 43-44. 46-52), McCarthy (54-59. 61), Sim (77).</page><page sequence="3">146 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART The Shelter The valley is aligned roughly east-west and the outcrop containing the shelter runs for about 80 m. along its southern slope, 12 to 15 m. above the valley floor. The outcrop presents a dark coloured rock face about 5-6 m. high, irregularly aligned but more or less vertical. The shelter is located toward its eastern end, at the top of an easy slope of about 30 m. up from the valley floor. Above it the slope is rocky and broken, rising steeply to the ridge top. The shelter is about 18 m. long. Its height at the front decreases from about 3-5111. at the western end to 2 m. at the eastern end. In section it deepens from a shallow overhang at the western end to a generally parabolic arc with a maximum depth of about 5 m. near the centre of its length. The more or less vertical section which forms the rear wall is generally about 1 m. high. The floor Most of the floor comprises a series of gradually sloping rock surfaces, which widen at the western end to extend well beyond the overhang. The eastern end of the shelter has weathered out into a secondary alcove and the rock floor here narrows and steepens, making it difficult, without support, to retain a footing on it. At this end of the shelter, and beneath the overhang, is a level area of sandy, ashy soil. The floor presents several interesting features. Towards the western end of the shelter is a spot where rainwater, channelled across the outcrop above, drops over its edge to the rock slope of the floor. At this spot is a group of four axe grinding grooves. Close to this, beneath the overhang, is a sloping depression in the floor. This depression is crossed transversely by a narrow rim of ironstone, producing a dished formation about 30 cm. across and up to 5 cm. deep. This enclosed depression appears to have been used as a mortar. In its deepest section, alongside the ironstone rim, is a group of seventeen vertical holes, apparently mortar holes. Most of these are irregular in shape and about 5 cm. deep. The largest is about 10 cm. deep and 5 cm. in diameter. A few metres further east and well beneath the overhang is a vee-shaped crevice in the floor, about 30 cm. deep and 60 cm. across. While not entirely watertight, it could be made so without much effort. On the sloping rock on the eastern side of this crevice are two axe grinding grooves. In several places, particularly toward the eastern end of the shelter, the rock surface of the floor is extensively pitted, consistent with its having been hammered or used as an anvil, although this pitting could conceivably be an effect of weathering. There are a few smoothed grinding marks scattered along the sloping surfaces of the floor. These are faint, the deepest being about 5 mm. deep, and most are small, less than 100 sq. cm. in area. THE DRAWINGS The shelter contains about one hundred and eighty-six distinguishable drawings and stencils. A large number of indeterminate lines and patches of colour occur</page><page sequence="4">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART 147 throughout the series and many of these appear to be the remains of figures which have substantially weathered away. In several sections of the series, most notably in those centred on large anthropomorphic figures, the drawings and stencils, random lines, redrawn outlines and re-rubbed infills are superimposed on each other to such an extent that identification of details is virtually impossible. This is particularly so because of the deteriorated condition of many parts of the series. The figures are distributed throughout the whole length of the shelter, along the rear wall and the roof, and on numerous small surfaces formed by the irregularities and hollows of the rock formation. A single figure (30, Section 6) is drawn on the roof of another small shelter in the outcrop, about 20 m. west of the main shelter. The figures are in black, white and red, with four figures in one group (16, 17, 18, 22, Section 6) painted (?) in a red-orange colour. Styles used are stencil, outline and solid infill. In a few small black figures, infilling is incomplete or is done with somewhat random striping. Apart from the stencils, two white figures (7, 21, Section 1), three red figures {63, 64, 66, Section 5) and, possibly, four red-orange figures (16, 17, 18, 22, Section 6) are paintings. The remainder are drawings done with dry pigment, charcoal and white and red ochres. Simple monochromes are in black, white and red. Simple bichromes are black infilled with white outline and red infilled with white outline. In a few cases, white outlined figures are infilled with both black and white rubbing. Some of the larger figures are drawn in black, white and red together. This appears to be the end product of processes of redrawing and re-rubbing with different colours at different times. None of the figures could be described with any certainty as true polychromes, i.e. as having been drawn in more than two colours at one time. Description of the Drawings Because of the large size of the series, only the more impressive figures are described in detail here. The complete series is listed in Table 1, where it is divided into six sections for convenience. In Table 1, the following abbreviations are used : Β - black Pt.- part W - white F- faint R - red or right Anth. - anthropomorphic figure L - left Indet. - indeterminate figure B.B. - black background Underlying several sections of the series are faded black infilled patches. In some cases these suggest a deliberately applied background colouring, although they may be remnants of old infilled figures which have weathered away. Figures listed as " male " and " female " are anthropomorphic figures. The number accompanying the figure represents its approximate maximum dimension in cms. ε</page><page sequence="5">148 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART "3 j ¡ 3 | S 1 I Ì . •S S ili 1'·3 Ia © I s ! ! α&gt; § ! &amp; o 1 '♦3 g wri I Hü O s_J I* ^ tí rt o &gt;j Ί2 o^ 'S© O *j »^ im i- in, ~ l g ¡Φ h I It Ρ,Ο MM MMMMMMMM ¡ϊ ■</page><page sequence="6">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART 149 è ja IM jii JK •9-1 » i , . - Sr&gt; o &lt;i&gt; MM W«fí« WM M M « M M</page><page sequence="7">150 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART i ¡ill" ~ ι"~Γ ! eg I l ι ι E J I I Õ « - ^ - s 3- - I If I» ¿ u g S) Ot^OOOvOMdcO ^t· «Λ νθ t^OO O' Ο μ μ (V) ^ m vu in. η η&gt; jg¿ g m m m m w « « w m ^t· m «Λ νθ m m t^OO m ^ O' &amp;eofnînS!oS&gt; Ο μ μ (V) ^ m vu Sî in. *5&gt;S η η&gt; ii - ~~</page><page sequence="8">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART 151 il 111 }fßn ¡}j]i ! if 'S .« &lt;« » s a;i J j cuJj «Jos J ti la 3 O H NJtJ m «CO-«· «OSO 1^ «&lt;^OM g JO j. ir&gt;O</page><page sequence="9">152 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART | I s Isaac si ί*ΐ lu *j!

The anthropomorphs are presumably male since they lack breasts. Except in one case the sex is indistinguishable, the lower parts of the figures having weathered away or not been drawn. The main focus of the series lies near the middle of its length, in the concentration of large figures in Section 5. At the western end of this group is a faded figure of the head and outstretched arms of an anthropomorph (Fig. 48) in red infill with a white outline. It has two large eyes in solid white and its massive flat-topped head, 75 cm. across, carries six vertical rays, also in red with a white outline. Each hand has four fingers. The arms are 25 cm. wide and the distance from hand to hand is 210 cm. Symmetrically placed above the anthropomorph are two large indeterminate animals (?) (Figs. 53, 54) 100 cm. and 75 cm. long, in black infill with a white outline, much overdrawn in white. These are posteriorly linked. Each has a rounded back and head and two eyes in solid white. West of these is the upper part of an anthropomorph (Fig. 61) 50 cm. long in black infill with a white outline. It is drawn in profile, with elongated eyes in solid white and four fingers on a single upraised arm. Overlapping this anthropomorph is the head of the largest figure in the series, an eel-like creature (Fig. 60) nearly 4 m. long which extends eastward across the two indeterminate animals (?). This figure, which is in outline, has been drawn at different stages in red and white. The red outline shows a single fin projection near the head and two small eyes near the nose. The white outline is broad, applied with no attention to detail and appears to have been redrawn more than once. Only the head and the upper outline of this figure remain clearly defined, although several separate lines in both red and white which extend across the large red anthropomorph appear to be parts of the original lower outline. The tail of the eel-like figure extends to the most impressive group of anthro- pomorphs in the series. The largest (Fig. 42) is a massive figure with upraised arms, 65 cm. across the body and about 180 cm. high. It is drawn in black infill with a white outline. The infilling has been gone over in white and parts of the outline are in red and white. It has a massive head bearing eight vertical rays, six eyes in white, two infilled, and three fingers on the right hand. It extends up onto the roof and its size, posture and situation convey a strong impression of power and strength. Superimposed on its chest is an anthropomorph (Fig. 43) 75 cm. long, drawn in white outline with upraised arms. Touching the right arm of the large anthropomorph is another (Fig. 36) 75 cm. long, drawn in white infill. It has thick legs, a large penis, three fingers on each hand, and is gracefully posed with upraised arms. Adjoining the large anthropomorph is another (Fig. 29) 90 cm. long, in black infill with a white outline, parts of which are in red and white. It has a bag-like protuberance on its right side, four infilled eyes in white, upraised arms and four</page><page sequence="18">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART IN THE MACDONALD RIVER DISTRICT, NEW SOUTH WALES.

In its right hand it holds a spear or pole 125 cm. long which extends up onto the roof. Alongside this figure is another anthropomorph (Fig. 12) 75 cm. long, drawn in black and red infill with a white outline. The lower part of the figure is infilled in black and white together. Parts of the outline are in red and white. It has a thickset body, upraised arms, a conical shaped head, two large infilled eyes in white and four fingers on its left hand. The second group of large anthropomorphs comprises three (Figs. 1, 7, 11) side by side in Section 3. The easternmost (Fig. 1) 125 cm. long, has a white outline, infilled with black, white and red, together. It has a series of black rays on its head, two infilled white eyes and three fingers on its right hand. Both arms are extended outward, but the left arm has been duplicated in a vertical raised position. The second figure (Fig. 7) 115 cm. long, has a white and black re-drawn outline, infilled with black and, in parts, black and red together. It has three infilled white eyes and its hands clasped above its head. The third figure (Fig. 11) 100 cm. long, has a black and white re-drawn outline, infilled with black and red together. It has a series of thick black rays on its head. Another large anthropomorph (Fig. 9) 125 cm. long, occurs in Section 1. This has an outline in white, black and red, infilled with black and red together. It is drawn in a " hocker " pose, with upraised arms and appears to have been re-drawn several times, the outlines being extensively duplicated in white, black and red. It has two penes and infilled white eyes which have been merged. Within its body is a koala (?) (Fig. 10), 50 cm. long, drawn in white outline, with two large eyes and a single upraised arm. On the eastern side of Fig. 9 are lines which suggest an anthropomorph, or possibly two anthropomorphs superimposed on each other (Fig. 13), 80 cm. long, drawn and re-drawn in white outline, partly infilled with black and white. Apart from those already described, many of the figures in the series deserve particular mention. Section 1 contains a seven rayed " sun " figure (Fig. 7), an infilled figure of a standing owl (Fig. 14) with large white eyes, drawn and re-drawn in black and white, and an indeterminate object (Fig. 21) painted in solid white, suggestive of the head and long horizontal horns of a bullock. Section 2 contains a snake (Fig. 10) and, on the roof, a kangaroo with two heads (Fig. 15), both in black infill with a white outline. Section 3 contains the only boomerang stencil (Fig. 13) in the series. This is a shallow curved hunting boomerang, 60 cm. long. Section 4 contains a preponderance of anthropomorphic figures. The largest of these is a male (Fig. 23) 100 cm. long drawn on the roof in black infill. Section 4 also contains two particularly artistic figures of a tortoise (Fig. 18) 20 cm. long in black infill, and a lyre bird (Fig. 27) 85 cm. long in black infill with a white outline.</page><page sequence="21">i62 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART The lyre bird has a long, thin arched neck and a long arched tail which terminates in a pyriform mass representing the lyre formation. Section 5 contains the only two fish in the series, one held in the beak of a long- legged bird. These are in black infill with a white outline. Below these is a par- ticularly well preserved stencil of a hafted axe (Fig. 18) 35 cm. long. Section 6 contains the only eel in the series and a very artistically drawn life- sized eagle (Fig. 19) in a perched position. Both are in black infill with a white outline. The eagle is superimposed on two lizards (Figs. 16, 18) 50 cm. and 35 cm. long, in red-orange infill. Below the eagle are the weathered remains of the head and outstretched arms of an anthropomorph (Fig. 24) 140 cm. long, in red infill with a white outline. It has a series of vertical rays on its head and four fingers on its right hand. Parts of the rays and one finger are also drawn in black. This figure closely resembles the large red anthropomorph (Fig. 48 Sec. 5,) first described. It suggests an attempt, by a considerably less competent artist, to copy the large figure which is drawn nearby. Subjects Table 2 lists the subjects depicted and the frequency of their occurrence. As regards subject matter, the outstanding feature of the series is the preponderance of anthropomorphic figures - fifty-one of the eighty-five identifiable figures. Of the remainder, kangaroos and wallabies are most numerous, accounting for eleven figures compared to the total of twenty other figures of birds, animals, fish and reptiles. There are fifty-five stencilled figures. Forty-seven are hands, of which twenty are left hands, fourteen are right hands and thirteen are indeterminate fragments. Two are full stencils of the hand and forearm. All are stencils of adult hands, although hand stencils of children and adolescents are not uncommon in sites in the Sydney district. Of the eight other stencilled figures, one is a shallow curved hunting boomerang and two are hafted axes. One axe is hafted at the butt of the blade and the other near the middle of the blade. The other five stencils are incomplete. Two of these vaguely suggest stencils of axes, and one a stencil of a right human foot. In several places in the series, patches of white colour suggest the remnants of stencils which have substantially weathered away. Styles and Colours Table 3 lists the occurrence of figures by style and colour. Infilled black figures predominate, with thirty-seven monochromes and fifty-six with a white outline, of a total of one hundred and thirty-one figures. Other infilled figures are rare, with three in white, four in red and three in red with a white outline. Simple outline figures are also rare, with five in black, seven in white and one in red. However, many of the indeterminate lines which occur throughout the series suggest the weathered remnants of outline figures. In particular, faded outline figures in red are especially difficult to distinguish, and markedly so in those cases where they underlie other figures.</page><page sequence="22">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART 163 H WoxproiO ? % « S S S S ^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^M ^^ ^^ ^^m ^^m ^^m ^^m ^^m mm mmm sipuo^smox « « 2 °° ï?

Few figures are in good condition and many are only clearly visible under particular light conditions. Along much of the length of the shelter the lower part of the drawings, just above the floor, has almost completely weathered away. On many of the black infilled figures outlined in white, only traces of the outline remain. This and the appearance of other white drawings suggest that lines in white tend to weather relatively quickly through the ochre particles flaking off bodily. Campbell (2, P. 4) comments on the lack of durability of pipe clay in cave art. The very faded appearance of many of the figures suggests that some of them may be of considerable age. The site does not appear to be a particularly exposed one, and, except at the western end of the shelter, where the overhang is very shallow, its surfaces are well protected from direct weathering. However, even on the roof surface, where from the author's observation, drawings in shelters of this type tend to be best protected and preserved,3 several black infilled figures are extremely faint. The general rate of weathering would, logically, depend to a large extent on the hardness and stability of the rock surface itself. From superficial examination the rock does not appear to be softer than normal, but the deeply undercut form of the shelter and the irregularities of its surfaces suggest that it is probably subject to fairly intensive weathering, so that the appearance of the drawings may be misleading as an indication of their probable age. According to Mr. Jurd, the series did not seem to have deteriorated since he first saw it about 1920, i.e. some 40 years earlier, but this observation would be a rather superficial and subjective one. The appearance of the individual figures, compared with each other, also suggests that they are of considerably varying ages. Even making some sort of allowance for differential rates of weathering on different surfaces within the shelter, some drawings look to be much older than others. Cases occur where figures are drawn in similar colours and styles almost side by side, but some appear freshly drawn while others are so faded as to be barely visible. Similarly with the stencils, which range from indistinct faded remnants to a few which are of strikingly fresh appearance. No cases occur where, in the author's estimation, the state of preservation of adjacent figures in basically different colours, red, black or white, might be taken to reliably suggest a significant difference in their ages. EVIDENCE OF OCCUPATION Apart from the drawings, and the marks on the floor, no significant signs of aboriginal occupation of the site were found. The shelter is dry and very weather- proof, but the rocky sloping nature of much of the floor lessens its attraction as a camping place. The outer parts of the overhang are lightly smoke blackened, but this might well be attributable to bushfires burning outside the shelter. According 8 In North-west Australia Love (15, P. 7) concluded that paintings on horizontal surfaces deteriorate more rapidly than those on vertical faces. FF</page><page sequence="25">i66 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART to Mr. Jurd, he had occasionally used the shelter as an overnight camp, but had always located his campfire well out to avoid damaging or smoking the drawings. The small level section of ashy, sandy soil toward the eastern end of the shelter was not excavated. It appears to be shallow. Some of the larger crevices in the floor were examined but contained only a few inches of accumulated sandy material. Examination of the drip line along the edge of the overhang and the water scoured areas of the slope beyond it revealed a very few scattered small flakes of chert and quartz lying on natural surface, but no implements or other evidence of aboriginal occupation. About 20 m. west of the shelter is another shelter in the same outcrop. This second shelter is a steeply sloping hollow about 3-5 m. across. It provides precarious footing and is high up on the outcrop and rather difficult to reach. Drawn on its roof is part of a figure of a man (Fig. 30, Section 6). Mr. Jurd knew of no other features or marks in the locality which might be attributable to aboriginal activity. However, in rugged country of this type, relatively unexplored in detail and containing innumerable rock shelters, there are probably many sites which remain unknown. Many of the trees near the shelter are very large mature specimens. Several of these were examined, but none appeared to bear any signs of marking. There appeared to be no engraved markings on the fairly large rock surface which extends along the top of the outcrop. The nearest known rock engraving is a single figure of a kangaroo situated on another ridge about 800 m. from the shelter. USE OF NATURAL FEATURES, GROUPING AND COMPOSITION In general, the figures occupy the various shallow depressions and concavities of the wall and roof of the shelter, either in groups, or, in the case of several small figures, singly. In a few cases, small figures such as the tortoise (Fig. 18, Section 4) and an indeterminate object (Fig. 62, Section 5) are drawn in the small regular concavities which are usual in these wind eroded sandstone shelters. This again is not uncommon in the Sydney district, and small figures are sometimes found in quite deep and markedly concave depressions, but whether the artist was guided in this choice of location by some specific motive or by whim, appears in most cases to be entirely a matter for conjecture. One fact is that in many of the rock shelters of the Sydney district, these wind eroded hollows, large or small, often present the smoothest and most regular surfaces, best suited for drawing purposes, so that their choice by the artist might well indicate a simple and quite pragmatic approach. For the series as a whole, there appears to be only one instance where the artist has deliberately utilized a prominent natural feature of the rock surface, viz, in Section 5 (Fig. 66) where the rims of a deep depression in an alveolate section of the roof have been painted (?) in a dark red colour. The painted (?) marks are of an indeterminate nature. It is open to speculation as to whether the overall distribution of the figures within the shelter reflects any conscious arrangements or associations by the artist(s)</page><page sequence="26">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART 167 in terms of either subject or style. Detailed study of the figures in situ suggests that the artist(s) generally sought to avoid using rough and irregular surfaces and, to some extent for this reason, if for no other, the figures present the appearance of occurring in groups. In general, however, the characteristics of these broad groups appear to the author to be insufficiently distinct from each other to provide any substantial indication that the groups themselves reflect a specific ordering by the artists, independent of the constraints imposed by the nature and accessibility of the rock surfaces. By contrast, Macintosh (16), on the basis of conclusions about style, technique, media used and artistic quality, proposed that the figures in one section of a divided shelter at Mount Manning were of ritual and sacred significance, belonging to an early and distinct art tradition, while the adjoining section of the shelter was a secular gallery in which the drawings, of natural species, were profane in character and simply illustrations of some local food species. The art in the Macdonald River shelter does not suggest to the author any reasonable conclusions along these unes. However, certain distinct features of the general arrangement of the series can be noted. One is the groupings of large anthropomorphic figures, and particularly the grouping of large figures in Section 5. Another is the usually intimate association of the stencils with the drawings. Another is the paucity of drawings at the western end of the shelter, a feature which might simply reflect the artists' disinclination to use this section, which is least well protected from the weather. Similarly the general concentration of figures about the middle of the shelter is probably at least partly attributable to the availability here of a large expanse of suitable surfaces on the roof. The figures in Section 1 occupy the deep secondary alcove at the eastern end of the shelter. A notable feature is the concentration of figures toward the eastern end of this alcove, a location which is poorly lit and particularly awkward and difficult to reach. The use of this type of location by the native artist(s) is a not uncommon feature of rock shelter art in the Sydney District.4 The drawings in the eastern end of this alcove, mainly male anthropomorphic figures, do not readily suggest any particular significance for this location, although the difficulties it would impose on the artist(s) do suggest some strong motivation for its choice. Another feature of the series as a whole is the restriction of all the substantial red figures to the generally western end of the shelter. Within the general arrangement of the series, groups of similar figures occur, and in some cases these groups, in their content and uniform state of preservation, create a general impression of being deliberate compositions of contemporary figures. These are, a pair of man (?) and woman (Figs. 8, 9) in Section 2, the group of three large male (?) anthropomorphs (Figs. 1, 7, 11) in Section 3, the group of three wallabies (Figs. 24, 25, 26) in Section 4, a pair of small male anthropomorphic figures (Figs. 2, 3) and the two posteriorly linked animals (?) (Figs. 53, 54) in Section 5, and, in Section 6, a pair of small anthropomorphic figures (?) (Figs. 6, 7) and a pair of lizards, a club (?) and a snake (?) (Figs. 16, 17, 18, 24) in a red-orange colour. * Macintosh (16) noted this feature at Mount Manning, in the same general district.</page><page sequence="27">i68 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART The first of these appears to be the only clearly identifiable example of a male- female composition in the series, although the size difference between the pair of lizards in Section 6 might be intended to identify a difference in sex. Other groups of similar figures occur but the individual figures appear to be of differing ages. These are mainly pairs and groups of anthropomorphic figures, and in a few cases, pairs of macropods. If the individuals in these groups are of signi- ficantly differing ages this might suggest that in certain cases the approach of the artist(s) was influenced to an extent by the figures already existing and by some strong association of ideas. However, the very deteriorated condition of much of the series renders this line of speculation unreliable. It is also open to speculation as to whether any of the groups incorporating natural species in intimate association with anthropomorphic figures or stencilled hands are intended as expressions of totemic relationship. In Section i, figures of owl and koala (?) drawn on large anthropomorphic figures, and in Section 5, the complex of the large eel-like creature and large animal (?) and anthropomorphic figures, are at least suggestive of such an expression. As McCarthy comments (66, P. 117), there are several figures among the known rock engravings of the Sydney district which appear to combine human and animal features, and which he identifies as representations of totemic ancestral beings, but only one such composite figure is known among the rock shelter drawings of the district. Superimpositions Some eighty examples of figures superimposed on others were recorded in the series. The superimpositions are set out in Table 4. In several other cases of super- imposed figures, sequences could not be determined with any certainty because of the deteriorated condition of the drawings. In this Table 4 (i) the large anthropomorphic figures in black, white and red are classified as basically black infilled with white outline bichromes ; (ii) their redrawn white outlines are of necessity considered as contemporaneous with the main figures ; (iii) the white and red outlines of the large eel-like figure are considered as individual figures, since they are separated by others. Leaving aside the " black background " group, i.e. assuming that these are not the remains of black infilled figures, then in the categories of total white figures, total black figures, total red figures and total stencils, the superimpositions present, by simple numerical majorities, a sequence of white over black over stencil over red. In the categories of total outline figures, total infilled figures, total bichromes and total stencils, the sequence is outline over bichrome over infilled over stencil. In terms of both style and colour together, the superimpositions identify stencils over</page><page sequence="28">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART 169 W H * 1 ï g * I * I I I MM I M I I I «I« * * 'S -S « t N I I I I I" I N I ·§&lt;§ δ sfili .

From studies of superimpositions, McCarthy (67, P. 240) has concluded that " in central-eastern New South Wales stencils were the earliest art, followed by a red and white, then a black and white and finally polychrome stages ". McCarthy's published specific identifications are as follows, CONJOLA (64) CORDEAUX (65) HAWKESBURY RIVER (66) (i) Stencil Period (i) Stencil Period (i) Stencil Period (ii) Red Period (ii) Red Period (ii) Red and White Period (Red outline and silhouette) (iii) Black Period (iii) Black and White Period (iii) Black and White Period (Black and/orWhite outline, silhouette and infilled) (iv) Bichrome Period (iv) Polychrome Period (iv) Polychrome Period (" Solid yellow with a (Black, White, Red and Yellow black outline ") combined) (v) Bora Ground Period (Red silhouette design) (vi) Post White Period (stencils) The superimpositions in the Macdonald River site tend to support McCarthy's conclusions in that (i) stencils predominantly underlie other figures, more particularly black and white figures ; (ii) black and white figures predominantly overlie red infilled figures. They do not support McCarthy's conclusions in that (i) red infilled figures predominantly underlie stencils ; (ii) red outline figures predominantly overlie white outline figures and black and white bichromes.</page><page sequence="30">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART 171 McCarthy (65, Pp. 100-102) suggested that the cave art of Central Eastern New South Wales has over time become progressively more complex as regards styles, colour combinations and subject matter, developing from the earliest phase in which simple monochrome outlines of animals were drawn in addition to stencils, to a terminal phase of polychrome art. McCarthy says (65, P. 101) : " It appears probable that polychrome work would have developed considerably in this region had it not been for the coming of the white man.1' Superimpositions recorded in the Macdonald River site would not, on several counts, support the conclusion that outline figures preceded infilled figures and bichromes, but would rather suggest the reverse order. Whether or not one accepts the view that superimpositions provide reliable evidence of chronologically sequential art phases or periods, it is obvious that a great deal of detailed study has yet to be added to McCarthy's pioneer work in the region before a definitive statement on superimpositions in its art can be formulated. In a total of twenty-three black and white bichromes and four red and white bichromes, white outlines, white infilling and white features such as eyes had been drawn over the basic infilling colours of black or red. In several of these cases white outlines had obviously been drawn only once, and so, if these were an integral part of the original figures, they were added last. Mountford (70, P. 190) in 1940 observed an aborigine at Ayers Rock (Central Australia) using this technique of drawing a red silhouette figure first, then outlining it in white. THE ART IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT In regard to style, content, technique, colours and general level of artistry, the drawings and stencils are, in the main, typical of the rock shelter art of the Sydney district. However, the series does have several features which are, in a regional context, very unusual and interesting. The large total number of figures in the shelter is particularly notable in a region where, of some two hundred known sites, none contain more than a few dozen drawings of significance, although large numbers of stencils are not uncommon. The drawings in the shelter also cover an unusually wide range of subjects, including, in addition to the more usual ones, such as anthropomorphs and macropods, species such as tortoise, lyre bird, eagle, wading bird and owl, subjects which are generally rare in the rock art of the New South Wales Central Coast region. Of the few figures in the series which are not readily identifiable, the two white paintings in Section 1 are notable, one (Fig. 7) of a seven rayed " sun " figure of the type found in a few sites, mainly in areas north of the Hawkesbury River, and the other (Fig. 21) of an oval shape with a long narrow projection on either side. The most unusual and interesting figures in the series are those of the large eel-like creature and the largest anthropomorphs. Figures like these, of super normal proportions, have only been recorded from a few sites in the cave art of the</page><page sequence="31">i72 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART region5 although they are quite typical among its rock engravings.6 A most extra- ordinary feature of the series is its large number of big anthropomorphic figures. Of the few published sites in the region where this type of figure occurs, none features more than three such figures together.7 In regard to subject matter and conventions of depiction, the drawings exhibit a fairly close conformity with the known rock engravings of the Macdonald River area. As in the engravings (Sim, 77, P. 34) anthropomorphic figures and macropods are numerically predominant. There is considerable resemblance between the largest anthropomorphs in the series and those which commonly occur among the engravings of the Sydney district generally. They feature the common characteristics of massive powerful looking bodies, short stout limbs, large eyes and, not infrequently, rayed headgear (hair ?). Several of the large anthropomorphs in this series have multiple eyes (?), a not uncommon feature of engravings in the Sydney region, particularly engravings of anthropomorphs and macropods. SCALE AND CONTENT OF THE DRAWINGS Examination of the drawings in situ suggests that in many cases at least, the scale at which the figures were drawn was not dictated particularly by the nature of the rock surfaces, but rather that the artist(s) generally observed a certain convention of scale, such that smaller subjects, e.g. birds and reptiles, were drawn more or less life size and large subjects, principally human figures and macropods, were generally drawn at a considerably reduced scale. If this is the case, it seems reasonable to conclude that the largest anthropomorphs, the large eel-like creature in Section 5 and the kangaroo (Fig. 25) some 230 cm, long in Section 6 would equate in conception to the outsize figures of this type which occur among the Sydney district engravings. In this series, which features an unusually wide range of species, figures of wombat and emu are absent. This is particularly noticeable since both would have been important food species in the region. The omission of emu is interesting, since emu tracks (and kangaroo tracks) appear to be one of the commonest motifs among the rock engravings of the Macdonald River area (Sim, 77, P. 34), much more so than in the remainder of the Sydney district. Tracks of any kind, either human or animal, appear to be a very rare motif in the cave art of the Sydney district, which in this respect contrasts strongly with the cave art of many other parts of the continent where they form a prominent element. The absence from the cave art of the lines of tracks and compositions of animals and their tracks which frequently occur among the * In the Sydney district, large drawings of eel-like creatures have been recorded by Campbell (2, PI. 29, Fig. 1) at Brisbane Water and by McCarthy (65, P. 100) at Cordeaux. In both cases the creatures occur with small human figures. Large anthropomorphs among the cave drawings are known from Milbrodale (Mathews 43, 44, 50 ; McCarthy 68, Fig. 19), Mount Manning (Macintosh 16), Hawkesbury River (McCarthy 66), Wilton (Sim 76) and a few other sites in the area south of Sydney (unpublished). * McCarthy (68, ¥. 42) has commented on the rarity of large anthropomorphic ngures in the rock shelter art of the Sydney district. 7 At a site in the Hawkesbury River district (McCarthy 66).</page><page sequence="32">A GALLERY OF CAVE ART 173 district's engravings might be taken as evidence that the artists, given an abundance of large and generally level rock surfaces, deliberately eschewed the non-horizontal surfaces available in shelters as being less appropriate for this type of representation. This would be particularly the case if, as is usually concluded, the engraved tracks were physically followed during ceremonies. The occurrence or absence of emu and emu- tracks particularly as motifs in the rock art of the Sydney district generally might be conjecturally related to the fact that in South Eastern Australia the emu was a bird of most sacred associations. 8 Comments made by Mathews9 on the totemic affinities of the Darginjung social sections offer no evidence of relation between the content of the art in the shelter and totemic affiliations within the tribe. IDENTITY OF THE PRINCIPAL FIGURES Since almost nothing is known of the mythology of the coastal tribes of South Eastern New South Wales, comment about the identities of the principal figures in the series must be almost completely speculative. The site lies within the territory of the Macdonald River group of the Darginjung tribe, which occupied the country generally between the Hunter and Hawkesbury Rivers.10 The remnants of the hinterland groups of the tribe apparently disappeared about the turn of the century11 Mathews' descriptions12 of the Darginjung language, initiation ceremonies and social organisation comprise the only substantial original accounts of the tribe, supplemented by a few brief comments of earlier observers18 and fragments of information handed down from pioneer settlers. McCarthy has concluded that the large eel-like figures, up to 11 metres in length which occur among the rock engravings of the Hawkesbury River District14 and a single similar figure nearly 6 m. long in a rock shelter at Cordeaux15 are representations of the mythical Rainbow Serpent, the giant water dwelling spirit of semi deity status, 8 Howitt (14) records that among the south-east coastal tribes the emu Ngalalbal was the wife (P. 546) and mother (Pp. 553, 560) of the Supreme Being Daramulan. Fox the Wiradhuri, the emu was linked with the subordinate deity Daramulan at tibe bora ceremony and was the food of the All Father Baiarne (P. 588). Among the Gamilaroi and Juwalarai, certain legendary or spirit beings were of human form but had the legs and feet of emus (Mathews 32, Parker 72, Pp. 21-22). Among the Wiradhuri, Nguruin-dinnag-garag meant emu's feet, and the Supreme Being Baiarne had such feet (Fraser 10, P. 94). 9 Mathews (41, Pp. 170-71) noted that among the Darginjung the (male) sections Bya and Kubbi included totems of scrub possum, native bee, emu, bandicoot, eaglehawk, stingaree and wallaroo, while sections Ippai and Kumbo included grey kangaroo, diamond snake, wombat, black snake and wallaby. 10 Mathews (28, P. 1, 41, P. 170). 11 Mathews (28, P. 1) described " a small remnant of the Darkinung tribe ", about sixty men, women and children, mostly half-castes, and including only two initiated men, on a Government Reserve in the Windsor district.

The Rainbow Serpent belief is well known for Central and North Western Australia, where the spirit creatures not uncommonly feature in rock shelter art1· and is known to have existed in some form in the south-eastern part of the continent. Evidence that the giant water spirit formed an important element in the belief and ritual of the tribes of South Eastern Australia has been reviewed by Radcliffe- Brown (74) and McCarthy (60). Nothing is known of the affinities of the Rainbow Serpent belief in this part of the continent. Brief additions can be made to the original evidence provided by the earliest observers17 and Radcliffe-Brown. Threlkeld (78, P. 52) describes the " Wau Wai "18 of the Newcastle-Lake Macquarie area (Awabagal Tribe, adjoining the Darginjung on the north east) as " a monster of a fish ", malevolent to humans, which inhabits the Lake, swamps, and bottomless waterholes. Among the Danggadi tribe, centred on the Macleay River district further north, the Gabulgan is a fabulous water monster.19 In the Bunya Bunya area of South-east Queensland the rainbow was a giant serpent, Thugine, which was much feared.20 The semi deity status of the spirit is confirmed by the belief among the Wiradhuri of Central New South Wales that it was served by attendants and messengers called Barinma.21 There seems little doubt that the large eel-like figure in the Macdonald River shelter represents this giant water spirit, part serpent and part fish, known as Gu-ru- ngaty or Gu-rang'-atch to the Dharawarl and Gan'dangara tribes south and south- west of Sydney22 and responsible for the Dreamtime creation of the major waterways and waterholes of the southern Blue Mountains, in the streams and waterholes of which its descendants still live.28 16 A considerable body of information and comment on the Rainbow Serpent in aboriginal belief and art includes, notably, that in Berndt.

It is generally accepted that the outsize anthropomorphe which are common among the engravings of the Sydney district and which occur much less commonly in its rock shelter art are representations of ancestral beings and deities of various kinds or identities.24 Of the common features of these types of figures, superhuman size, powerful appear- ance and " heroic " features such as rayed head gear, body ornamentation and out- size genitals, several are displayed by the largest anthropomorphs in this series, and there seems little room for doubt about their superhuman representation. According to Mathews and Howitt,25 the Supreme Being, the All Father which formed the central element of religious belief in Eastern Australia was, for the south- east coastal tribes, Daramulan. The practice of depicting within the sacred precinct of the initiation ground, ancestral beings and the routes of their travels, natural species, totemic and clan designs by ground and tree engravings and by earth and other models, has been documented for much of South Eastern Australia.26 While there is no original observation of the use or role of rock art in the Sydney area, most observers27 conclude that the primary function of much of it was a ritual one in ceremonies for the increase of species, initiation and the like. Howitt (14, P. 553) illustrates an earth model of Daramulan from an initiation ground in the South Coast district in which the figure bears two horn-like rays on its head.28 In this account of the Dargin]ung initiation ceremonies, Mathews identified two of three earthern figures modelled in the bora ring as representations of Daramulan, the Supreme Being and Ghindaring, a malevolent male being with a body which glows red like burning coals. Ghindaring lives in rocky places on the sides and tops of mountains and fathers warn their sons to keep away from such places.29 On the earth figure of Ghindaring within the bora ring was placed the receptacle for the ritual blood let during the ceremony. If the view were taken that colour, e.g. in this case red, was used by the artist(s) as a medium for identification,30 the large anthro- pomorphic figure drawn in red infill in the rock shelter might conjecturally be related to this being Ghindaring. As against this, the red figure is very faint and does not *4 Of the large anthropomorphs recorded among cave art in the Sydney district, one of the most striking has an animal-like head, and is identified by McCarthy (66, P. 117) as representing an ancestral totemic being, having both human and animal characteristics. «Mathews (18, 22, 28, 30).

Parker (71, P. 135) comments that " red is a great devil's colour " among the aborigines. Parker (71, Pp. 7-8, Mare Australian Legendary Tales (1898), Pp. 90-91) and Milson (69) noted the asso- ciation, among the Juwalarai and Gamilaroi, of the Supreme Being and his wives with red coloured flood waters, believed to derive from a mystical " flood-ball " of blood which was loosed by them.</page><page sequence="35">176 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART appear to have ever been " touched up " as some of the other anthropomorphic figures have. This might suggest doubts about the likelihood of its being of recent ritual significance. Two of the large anthropomorphs in the series have three and four eyes res- pectively, and the largest of them has six. As mentioned earlier, this feature of multiple " eyes " is not uncommon among the engravings of the Sydney district. In the case of certain engravings of anthropomorphic figures, Elkin (6, Pp. 132, 137) suggests that the numerous punctured marks on the head may represent eyes, ears, nose and mouth together. However, some evidence suggests that such marks may indicate omniscient power. Among the Gumbainggar of the North Coast, there is, or was, belief in three equivalent spirit beings who lived, one in the north, one in the south and one in the west. Each had several eyes in its head and could see in all directions at once. Between them they saw everything which occurred on earth.81 Among the Wiradhuri, which adjoined the Darginjung on the west, Gundyar was a deity who sees and knows everything and " makes natives die ''32 Among the Gamilaroi, north of the Darginjung, Yarree Yarwoo was an anthropomorphic spirit with four eyes. All sickness was attributed to him.33 Parker34 refers to the " All- seeing Spirit " which conveyed to the Supreme Being Baiarne accounts of happenings on earth. Some features of the large anthropomorphic figures as a series are notable. Particularly striking is the difference between the majority of them, which are markedly upright figures, drawn basically in black infill with white outline, and the broad and massive head and shoulders of the figure in red infill with white outline (Fig. 48, Sec. 5). This pronounced difference in portrayal, the generally well preserved condition of the black and white figures, and the relatively faded condition of the red figure might well suggest that the latter was a product of an earlier and possibly different art tradition. Another interesting possibility is that the smaller and some- what similar figure (Fig. 24) in Section 6, rather crudely drawn in red infill with white outline, represents an attempt by a considerably inferior artist, to copy the large red figure nearby. Macintosh (16) concludes, for one site, that somewhat comparable examples of poor copies are probably crude imitations by later artists of figures which belonged to an earlier and foreign art tradition. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SITE The various features of the shelter, the locality and the drawings strongly suggest that the site was a ritual centre, and probably one of very considerable significance to the aborigines of the district. The location of the area, in rugged country remote from the main river valley, its permanent water and general fertility 81 This Gumbainggar belief is known to the author from the Bellinger River district.

As an alternative to the analogic conclusion that the shelter was probably used for purposes of group ritual, it might be suggested that it was one of the sites visited specifically by the " clever men " of the tribe in their periodic pilgrimages to isolated places to fast, meditate and commune with the spirits.86 The large total number of drawings and their widely varying state of preservation suggest that the site was visited and the series added to over some considerable period of time. The general absence of signs of domestic occupation indicates that the shelter itself was not lived in to any extent. The marks on the rock floor are consistent with a conclusion that the shelter was used by men, grinding axes and possibly preparing pigments for painting and stencilling. As in several shelters in the Sydney district, the deliberate placing of drawings and paintings in locations which are difficult and awkward to reach, suggests that such figures and/or such locations were in themselves of more than ordinary significance to the artist(s). The interpretation of a ritual function for the figures is particularly strong in those cases where they appear to have been re-drawn on several occasions, often with little regard for the details of the original figure. Their appearance most strongly suggests the ritual redrawing and " touching up " of traditional aboriginal procedure. Finally, the content of the drawings, on the basis of the interpretations suggested here, would appear to present the strongest evidence of the probable ritual function and significance of the site, one in which is depicted, in addition to humans and a considerable range of animal species, some of the principle anthropomorphic and spirit beings which featured in local belief and ritual. Notes and Acknowledgements The Macdonald River shelter was recorded as part of a programme of recording rock art in the Sydney district. A standardized method of recording was used. The series was traced in full onto sheets of waterproof transparent tissue which were then reduced photographically to produce a scale mosaic. The completed drawing was drawn from this mosaic, using the original tracings and the photographic record of the series as aids in interpretation. The completed diagram was checked in detail against the drawings on the site. Because vandalism of aboriginal rock art is rife in the Sydney district, the exact location of the shelter is deliberately not disclosed. It is situated in rugged country, remote from settlement, and since its discovery, has been visited by only a few Europeans. The only signs of their presence are the initials J. J. of the original 85 According to Gumbainggar informants on the North Coast, the " clever man " ngalungir periodically visited a series of these places, called nambai, according to a set sequence, living on a starvation diet of water, honey and pith of the Bangalow Palm. These sites were frequently in elevated places, difficult of access and were strictly avoided by all except the ngalungir. Of a few nambai known to the author in the Bellinger River district, three are, or were, cave-like formations.</page><page sequence="42">3 A GALLERY OF CAVE ART finder, drawn on the wall with a red coloured stone, and now very faded, and a section of log, cut by Mr. E.
