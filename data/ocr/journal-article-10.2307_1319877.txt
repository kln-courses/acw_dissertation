<plain_text><page sequence="1">47 STASIS AMIDST CHANGE: A PREDICTION ABOUT THE ARTS FOSTER WYGANT Whether harried or exhilarated by the champions of change, art educators might have welcomed the conservative analyses in Leonard B. Meyer's Music, the Arts, and Ideas when it appeared in 1967.' The major, central portion of the book is a study of "patterns and predictions in twentieth century culture," an effort to comprehend the present through speculation on the future and on the nature of change in the arts. Meyer is a musicologist who calls himself an analytic formalist; his applications of gestalt and information theories to music have attracted much admiration and some opposition.2 Not surprisingly, he prizes rational structure as against change; formal elegance more than emotional or sensuous intensity; conventional intelligibility as against esoteric experiment. Seeking to project the durable validity of these elements of our tradition, in terms applicable to all the arts, he is brilliantly comprehensive and resourceful. Five years after publication, Meyer's analyses and characterizations seem no less fitting and perhaps prophetic. Whether or not his conclusions are accepted, art educators may still appreciate the broad base of readings, the wealth of insights, the thorough and thoughtful design of his argument. The first three chapters and the entirety of part III are concerned specifically with music, but may reward any reader interested in problems of value, form, and communication in the arts, who is equipped with at least modest comprehension of the character and workings of traditional and post-diatonic music. The art-oriented reader may enjoy Chapter IV, "Forgery and the Anthropology of Art," an essay on values. But the major study begins with Chapter V, "The End of the Renaissance," in which Meyer considers the arts generally, and introduces his controlling concern: the possibility that the entire post-medieval humanist-rationalist tradition in Western art may be terminated by the contemporary anti-formalist, phenomenalist-sensationalist movement. In 1963, when this chapter was written, most of us might have considered that the challenging music was serial or electronic; visual artists could have watched that battle from the sidelines. But Meyer focused on random, indeterminate music, which has general import for all the arts, because the aesthetic of chance is generated by a broad rejection of our habitual confidence in rationality, causality, predictability, and discernible form in life and art-the whole humanist, anthropomorphic outlook. This is why we have all become intent, as Meyer was, to speculate on the likelihood of a drastic aesthetic and stylistic revolution in the years ahead. The whole of Part II, 145 pages, is developed as an argument for two main probabilities. First, he believes, during the next several decades, the many current styles in the arts will neither coalesce, nor wholly disappear, nor be superseded by a single, dominant, radically new style. Instead, we will continue to use and enjoy a variety of styles, with frequent shifts and novelties, in what Meyer calls a "fluctuating and dynamic steady-state." Second, he predicts that the prevailing aesthetic attitude will be the eclectic formalism which in fact has increasingly occupied the central position in the arts through this century, midway between the conservative</page><page sequence="2">STUDIES IN ART EDUCATION traditionalists and the avant-garde. Actually, the future Meyer projects feels quite familiar, as well it should, since he believes we have lived within a period of fluctuating stasis in the arts for at least the past forty years. To establish the plausability of stasis, in the face of all current claims that change is our only certainty, Meyer has to challenge several well-established assumptions as to the inevitability of change in the arts, in such a way as to set up the claim of continuing vitality for earlier styles: a formalist eclecticism must appear as a valid component of late twentieth century culture. But some of the common assumptions about change are based in part on questionable, simplistic extrapolations from the past. So Meyer begins with a general discussion of "history, stasis and change," reminding us that "history" is always a selective construct, and that such concepts as "past," "present," and "future" are highly relativistic and flexible. An event or trend (or style element) which may appear dead within one historical construct (Meyer speaks of "hierarchic levels") may exhibit continuing force along another chain of consequence (in another hierarchy) and thus, in that domain, exist virtually in the present. (We are warned to avoid what Meyer calls "the fallacy of hierarchical uniformity," the "tacit and usually unconscious assumption that the same forces and processes which order and articulate one hierarchic level are operative, are equally effective, and function in the same fashion in the structuring of all levels.") Thus he undercuts arguments claiming historical necessities or inherent stylistic dynamics. Moreover, Meyer distinguishes several kinds of cultural change, e.g., predictable developmental patterns, evolutions, mutations, transformations, trends-and calls attention to the variety of changes which may exist concurrently without merging as a single linear movement. Important also for his projection is the observation that numerous small-scale, non-cumulative changes may activate a cultural period which, viewed on the whole, externally, will appear quite static. Predictions of change, then, are meaningless without specification of type and scale of change. We are cautioned against over-reaction: the magnitude of innovations should be assessed from a broad viewpoint, with a sense of history. Turning to the arts, Meyer dissects the popular notions that specific cultural factors somehow directly cause style change; that each culture is reflected by one style; that this representative style will be formed analogously in all the arts. Contemporary scholarship shows that cultures are seldom monolithic; accordingly, several styles will coexist, none of which alone can mirror or lead the "whole" culture, and a variety of kinds of shift may develop in concurrent styles. Moreover, a change in one art form, under whatever influences, cannot be claimed to entail parallel change in other arts, because each has its own particular dynamic and technical structure. Conversely, any change tendency which is generated technically within one medium will be constrained by its other technical factors (not by the "culture"), including, for example, difficulties for performers and for the audience who must unlearn and relearn appropriate modes of response to the particular "language" of that medium. In these matters, Meyer depends much on Ackerman, whose work in the theory of style has weakened another popular belief which Meyer must surmount: styles are neither governed by any inevitable principle of development, triumph and decay, nor do they follow one another in simple, single succession. Meyer, of course, recognizes the general tendency toward correlative changes in style in the arts, a-nd in the culture, but concludes that an "ideological climate can foster stylistic change without determining or specifying its pattern of development." Hoping that he has demonstrated that "neither factual evidence nor theoretical 48</page><page sequence="3">STASIS AMIDST CHANGE: A PREDICTION ABOUT THE ARTS considerations preclude the possibility of stasis," he next argues that Western culture is not on the verge of a transformation which would impel the arts toward radical change, but rather is moving toward a period of consolidation and stability. Among the many factors he adduces, he is least persuasive in his suggestion that technological change is approaching a limit, that changes will be "in degree rather than in kind." Today, Meyer would be able to point to growing resistance to ungoverned technological "advances" and to an increased determination to devote technology to the achievement of equality and stability in the world community. He is more interesting and convincing in his discussion of cultural and ideological shifts. According to Meyer, neither geography (we hadn't reached the moon) nor anthropology nor history is capable of the discoveries which have formerly stimulated the arts. The high value assigned in recent Western culture to novelty and change, to a degree exceptional in history, was supported by belief in preordained progress, perfectability, natural law, and a purposeful evolution-none of which is intellectually acceptable today. In the place of such comprehensive optimism, we have developed a relativistic, analytic, formalistic mentality, demonstrable equally in science and art. At the same time we have reduced our confidence in genius and leadership, moving toward staff structures, anonymity, and impersonality. In the arts, formalism equates the old with the new; anti-formalism cares nothing for goals or progress; and "insofar as the belief in individualism and self-expression encouraged developmental change in the arts, that cause of change is virtually non-existent today."3 Furthermore, he says, non-formalist art-the aesthetic announced by such contem- poraries as Cage, Stockhausen, and Rauschenberg, which Meyer calls "radical empiricism," then "transcendental particularism"-will not produce a cumulative uni-directional change, in part because this aesthetic features passivity and pur- poselessness, and seeks continuously novel, fresh perceptual phenomena, rather than technical development or culture-responsive subject matter. And, although time and progress are neutralized in both formalist and anti-formalist art (remaining potent only in the most traditional and popular "right-wing") so that both tend toward small- scale variability within large-scale stasis, the formalist aesthetic will provide broadest satisfaction, Meyer believes. Formalistic art meets with human demands for comprehensive organization, offers a high level of qualitative sensory experience, accommodates a wide variety of sub-styles and eclectic pleasures, and accords still with the characteristic mentality of our age. These, and many other comparative observations are linked with restatements of earlier points to form a culminating discussion of "aesthetics of stability"-Meyer's title for the final chapter of Part II--a discussion which richly fulfills his introductory promise that one speculates on the future in order to understand the present. To complete the summary, it should be said that, for the adequately prepared reader, Part III, "Formalism in Music: Queries and Reservations," plays out, in cogent detail, many of the foregoing analyses of the conditions of form/content and communication/listener-satisfaction as they exist in the current musical scene. Assessment of Meyer's contribution should begin with the assertion that what he has learned about style and culture has great general value. His 1967 projection for the future certainly provided a reasonable evaluative framework, surely more stable than Harold Rosenberg's "Tradition of the New," which heavily influenced Meyer, and to which, by this time, we are getting accustomed. But whereas Rosenberg, with increasing irony, still scans the scene for symptoms of further decay, Meyer, a stout- hearted scholar, managed a scenario which would keep the center intact and active. He was probably correct. Despite McLuhan, there is little reason to believe that 49</page><page sequence="4">STUDIES IN ART EDUCATION technological changes soon will transform human interests and experience to the extent that traditional modes and masterpieces will lose all appeal. If reality becomes more mediated, and conceptual, the significance of the ordinary will remain urgent, the thing-ness of the aesthetic object will be valued. Yet even though new science does not supplant old art, our world concept will change, and new art will emerge. But, as Meyer points out, most of us already belong to several audiences; we can welcome the enrichments of new experience without surrendering older insights and achievements. However uncertain, Meyer's flexible projection will guide the observer-and the art teacher-more usefully than announcements of imminent esthetic revolution. Nevertheless, the uncertainties of prediction are complicated in this case by the difficulties of generalizing from one art form to another. Developments since Meyer completed this work, in 1967, force the question whether his concepts, appropriate as they are to a special concern in music, are equally valid for the plastic arts, present and future. In general it is clear that the distinctive relationships between form, content, and reference in the various arts must be handled with special care by a theorist of music as information. More specifically, the concept of teleology, characterizing a basic creative orientation, helps Meyer to categorize all formal composition in a temporal, syntactical art like music, which traditionally has indeed been organized purposefully, but it cannot serve equally well, in the simultaneously- received visual arts, to isolate formalist stylistic traits (teleology?) from the products of chance, indeterminacy, and anti-formalism. Granting that teleology refers to philosophic pre-disposition rather than product, the whole of spontaneous-intuitive visual art intervenes: it is neither formalistic, nor indeterminate, nor predetermined. What of minimal art, having nothing to do with chance, but often lacking any internal relationships, purposive or otherwise? Another example. Meyer's basic formulation for the future-an intelligible formalism at the center, challenged by experiential anti-formalism-may have become useless in the plastic arts. These categories are clearly applicable to many of the novelties of the '60's (happenings, conceptual art), but there are other departures (lasers, sculptures of fire or air or water, electronic environments) which perhaps cannot be explained as either formal or anti-formal. While technological art may not, as Burnham expects, replace traditional forms, such works may impose a whole new aesthetic, with "formalism" a dead issue, and with the old "principles of design" sorely challenged. Finally, for art educators who accept Meyer's thinking in general, what im- plications? Some might become less likely to over-react (for bandwagon or hearse) as each new style promises or threatens to obliterate the past and present. Those who fear that continuously more esoteric and "difficult" professional art4 will imply curriculum content progressively removed from the basic representational motivation of children and many teenagers might welcome Meyer's prediction that the functions and processes of traditional art will endure in a pluralistic culture. Those whose confidence is sapped by successive novelties may feel reinforced-their media may remain legitimate-but they will have to keep learning, and they will need to brace themselves for continuous shock. The necessary flexible foundation in the preparation of art teachers (and in secondary schools) will require deliberate and updated analytic- formalist pedagogy in the service of unpredictable outcomes, but not mere indoctrina- tion in the latest international innovation, nor the avoidance of contemporary innovations in "historical-critical" studies. Those in college who are charged with the art-orientation of freshmen may find in the work under review many insights, even the balance of wise scholarship, to be re-phrased for the eager, the anxious, the puzzled. 50</page><page sequence="5">STASIS AMIDST CHANGE: A PREDICTION ABOUT THE ARTS As to the prediction of minor flux and change within large-scale stasis, the reader may note that the Whitney Annual in the 1971-72 season was criticized as usual for its eclectic and poorly organized selection.5 After a decade of short-lived new "styles", the poet-critic John Ashbery, welcoming the return of Esteban Vicente in a one-man show last spring (1972), spoke of "the prevalent notion which has only recently begun to be disputed, that only one type of art can be exhibited and taken in during a given period," and remarked that "now, it seems anyone is free to do whatever he wants, a new and radical idea."6 Actually, throughout the '60's many galleries had never dropped their "stables" in favor of the fads; there was always wide variety in New York. On the other hand, in the same month, another critic, Irving Sandler, reported that, after a high-level panel program at the Modern Museum of Art, "formalism is dead."7 Foster Wygant is professor and head, Department of Art Education, College of Design, Architecture, and Art, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio.
