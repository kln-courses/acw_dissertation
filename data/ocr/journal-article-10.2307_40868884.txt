<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pavio Markovyé. Rusyn Easter Eggs from Eastern Slovakia. Translated by Marta Skorupsky. Vienna: Wilhelm Braumüller, 1987. 146 pp. Ösch 320.00. The decorating of Easter eggs is a calendar custom which still obtains among Slavs even in North America. (See, for example, Andrew Cincura "Slovak and Ruthenian Easter Eggs in America: The Impact of Culture Contact on Immigration Art and Custom," Journal of Popular Culture, IV [1970], pp. 155-93; Johanna Luciow, Ann Kmit, and Loretta Luciow, Eggs Beautiful: How to Make Ukrainian Easter Eggs [Minneapolis, Minn., 1975].) A plethora of popularly written articles on various aspects of this custom tend to appear in the ethnic press of various Slavic groups in North America around Easter time. The majority of these publications represent at best general surveys of this folk art or focus on the motifs and tech- nique involved in this Easter ritual. This translation of Pavlo Markovyö's Ukrain- ian Easter Eggs of Eastern Slovakia is a welcome addition to the literature, espe- cially that available in English. The translation of Markovyé's work does more than shed light on the history, motifs, and technique of Easter egg decorating. It contains a map of Rusyn- inhabited regions of Eastern Slovakia prepared by Paul R. Magocsi, an Introduc- tion, and thirteen chapters which range from "The Origins of Pysanka Ornamentation" to "The Symbolism of Colors in Folk Art and Folklore." A full bibliography and a list of illustrations complete this very thorough study. It contains a wealth of primary information based on field work. For example, in the chapter on Pysanka motifs in everyday life and customs Kataryna Tjahla explains that the spider symbol is derived from the popular saying "A spider in the house means good fortune" (p. 84). Another informant states: "When the Virgin</page><page sequence="2">160 I Revue Canadienne des Sla vistes Mars 1988 Mary was fleeing with Christ, a spider spun up their tracks behind them. For this the Blessed Virgin marked him with a cross. That is why spiders are not to be killed" (p. 85). Other folk beliefs, customs, cures, sayings, songs, and tales demonstrate the symbolism of Easter egg motifs on a wider scale and thus present the context within which those in this part of Slovakia belong. The motifs are categorized both according to group (cosmic, phytomorphic, anthropomorphic, genre scenes, etc.) and according to their cultural significance. The chapters on colour symbolism and the games played with these eggs add to our understanding of the subject. In funding the translation of this work into English, the Carpatho-Rusyn Research Center has provided the North American cultural anthropologist, folklorist, or ethnographer with a text which would probably have been inaccessible to them in the original.
