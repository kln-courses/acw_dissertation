<plain_text><page sequence="1">278 BOOK REVIEWS Der Analogiebegriff bei Kant und Hegel. By E. K. SPECHT. (Cologne: Kolner Universi- tatsverlag. 1952. Pp. 86). Despite its title, this book is mainly about Kant : Hegel appears only in what might be called an a non lucendo capacity, in so far as he did not make use of the concept of analogy in his theology. Dr. Specht wants to show why more recent writers have taken so little interest in Kant's suggestions about the use of analogy to give content to the idea of God, and does it by means of an admirable exposition of the passages in the Phenomenology where the Kantian notions of God's transcendence and the limited nature of the human intelligence come under attack. But his main concern is to set out Kant's views and place them in their proper context. He believes that Kant should be seen as working within a philosophical tradition which derives from Plato and Aris- totle and was restated by Thomas Aquinas, a tradition from which he inherited not only his fundamental dichotomy of sensibles and intelligibles, but also the difficulty of knowing how concepts designed to deal with sensibles could be said to apply to intelligibles. Aquinas faced this difficulty in a specifically Christian form: he had to show how terms normally used of things finite could also be used of God, who was by definition infinite. His solution was that such terms were applied to God neither univocally with their ordinary use nor equivocally but analogically. Dr. Specht sug- gests that Kant, faced with the parallel difficulty of how we are to speak of things in themselves, attempted a parallel solution. While well aware of the crudities of 'dog- matic ' anthropomorphism, he nevertheless thought a cautious use of analogy in giving content to the idea of God legitimate and even indispensable. Dr. Specht is a lucid writer and a careful scholar, but these qualities only serve to bring out the impressionistic character of this part of Kant's thought. For when we think about it, what does it mean to say that we attribute e.g. will and understanding to God in an analogical sense ? It is significant that Dr. Specht makes no real attempt to answer this question, nor does he succeed in making clear the conditions in which it is, and in which it is not, permissible to employ analogy in rounding out concepts. But there is perhaps a more serious fault in his whole treatment of the subject. Inter- ested as he is in Kant's ontological position, and in his theology as part of that, he naturally places emphasis on those passages in the first Critique where Kant expounds the positive use of ideas of reason. It is true that Kant makes several references to analogy in these passages, yet the fact remains that they are scarcely representative of his theology, which is a moral theology if it is anything. Because for Kant the idea of God has its main use in 'practical' contexts his employment of analogy is very different from that of Aquinas, in so far as the latter hoped to use it to extend our knowledge of God, whereas Kant had no such idea. Dr. Specht is too good a scholar to miss this point altogether, but he mentions it almost as an nfterthonilht in the course of his remarks about Hegel. It is perhaps a pity that he dlidtl 1(&lt;1l t'r lli on it more, for then he might have been led to treat this part of Kant's work in the only context in which there seems any hope of making sense of it : along with his distinction of 'matters of opinion ', 'matters of fact ', and ' matters of faith '.
