<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theology for Sceptics. Doroth?e Soelle. Translated by Joyce. L. Irwin. Pp. 126. Price ?9.55. Doroth?e Soelle opens her book with an account of her failure to impress upon a taxi driver in Berlin her faith in God. She asks herself why she was unable to communicate something of her 'hope', her 'strength', her 'joy' and goes on to ask whether it has become impossible in this age to speak about God. She notes that Meister Eckhart described God as 'that which is most communicable' and so she invites us to join her on a search for new ways of understanding this God. I was struck that she had attempted to share her faith with the taxi driver, as most of us keep our faith, such as it is, to ourselves as though the good news was an embarrassment. She begins by looking at our anthropomorphic images of God and in particular our use of the word 'father' to describe God. She eschews the patriarchal connotation of the word and instead begins with the pro phetic tradition of Hosea, Jeremiah and Third Isaiah. Here the Father stands for 'new creation in which the people will no longer be separated from God' (p. 63). This prophetic tradition is carried on into the synop tic gospels, where the father image is to be interpreted from the stand point of the kingdom of God rather than using the image in an authoritarian sense. As a feminist who had discarded the image of God as father, Soelle's retrieval I found original and refreshing. 667</page><page sequence="2">THE FURROW In speaking of God today we need to get away from any image that smacks of power and she suggests using images beloved by the mystics, like 'ground', 'depth', 'ocean' and 'mother', with the result that instead of honouring God for his power, we submerge ourselves in his love. A central part of her book is devoted to theodicy. How do we speak of God in the light of Auschwitz? Do we say with the evangelical woman 'Auschwitz was willed by God' (p. 13), or do we agree with the classical answer of Meister Eckhart: 'Everything that the good person suffers for God's sake he suffers in God, and God is with him suffering in his suf fering'? (p. 63). Following a visit to El Salvador Soelle asks whether the first world is ready for the good news: What right have we of the first world, who participate in its indif ference and objective cynicism, to ask the theodicy question? To listen to the poor and to learn from them means to change this question. The religious question about suffering is then no longer what we so often hear: How could God permit that? but rather the more difficult question which we have yet to learn: How do our pains become God's pain, and how does God's pain appear in our pains? (p. 71). She goes on to say that once we speak about God's pain, we abandon the patriarchal God and with it the dispute about theodicy and God becomes our mother who suffers with her children and comforts them on her lap. The Jesus of the gospels has these maternal qualities. During Soelle's visit to El Salvador she became convinced that the pains of the poor were also God's pain and that God would liberate them and heal their land. In keeping with her third world experience, her christology is 'from below'. She seems to fear that a christology 'from above' must inevitably end in docetism. She adopts Bonhoeffer's phrase to describe Jesus as a 'man for others'. The old formula 'true man' is rendered by Bonhoeffer as 'man', whereas being 'true God' is simply being there 'for others' (p. 96). In her chapter on loving God the author makes the case that only those who can give themselves can 'receive' in the deep sense of the word. She chides herself for her fear of fear which she attributes to her failure to love, citing 1 John 4:18, 'There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.' However, in John's next verse we read, 'we love because he first loved us'. I think that our problem with fear is not so much our failure to love as our lack of trust. 1 Peter 15 admonishes us to 'Always be prepared to make a defence to anyone who calls you to account for the hope that is in you.' This book helps us to do just that and is to be highly recommended. Doroth?e Soelle takes us on a provocative and challenging journey. She finally encourages us to nourish our faith by constant recourse to scrip ture. Helen Sheehy Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin 668</page></plain_text>
