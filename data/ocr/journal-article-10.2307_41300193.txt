<plain_text><page sequence="1">Storyworld / Umwelt: Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives David Herman In Nick Abadzis's Laika (2007), a graphic narrative based on histori- cal events surrounding the use of dogs as "test pilots" in the early days of the Soviet space program, the title character is a dog originally named "Kudryavka," or "Little Curly," after the shape of her tail (2 7).1 Subse- quently renamed "Laika" ("Barker") by Sergei Korolev, a rocket designer who had been imprisoned in the Gulag during Stalin's purges in the late 1930s, but who went on to become the architect of the Sputnik missions, the dog is conscripted into "an experimental scientific program to loft animals on vertical rocket flights into the upper atmosphere" (80). As part of this program, Laika, who forms a bond with research assistant Yelena Dubrovsky, is strapped into a massive centrifuge and also subjected to zero-gravity conditions during a parabolic jet flight. When Khrushchev demands that Korolev launch Sputnik II just one month after Sputnik I, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Russian Revolution and underscore the superiority of the Soviet space program vis-^-vis its U.S. counterpart, Laika is rocketed into orbit with no provision for recovery, dying (probably from stress and overheating) only hours into the flight - notwithstanding the Soviet government's claims that a system for pain- lessly euthanizing the dog had been put into place (189-90).2 In the two-page sequence reproduced as figure 1, Abadzis uses a complex layering of words and images to suggest what Laika's final mo- ments may have been like. Setting Laika's diminutive size against the hulking Soviet rocket in orbit around the earth, the sequence also draws a starkly ironic contrast between two scenarios, one imagined and the other actual. On the one hand, the imagined scenario involves a dream or fantasy in which Laika is cared for and spoken to compassionately by the woman who originally adopts her, and with whom the dog appears to associate "Mistress Yelena" of the space program; in this embedded dreamworld, Laika is empowered to fly on her own volition (see also 51- 55). On the other hand, the actual scenario involves the dog's final confine- ment, isolation, and painful death, all for reasons of political ambition. © Board of Regents, University of Wisconsin System, 2011 156 SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="2">Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives 1 57 Fig 1. From Laika, pages 178-79. © Nick Abadzis. Used with Permission of First Second Books. Because of the way it is situated in a larger narrative context, figure 1 involves a layering of no fewer than four experiential frames. Interpret- ing the sequence as a whole requires mapping individual images onto these (and potentially other) frames, as well as assessing the functions of shifts among frames. Frame 1: One frame corresponds to the inferences about Laika's con- dition which, in the pages that follow, the launch crew formulates on the basis of information received via medical telemetry. This telemetry, made possible by sensors surgically implanted in the dog (147; 180-84), reduces the qualitative richness of Laika's experiences to quantitative data based on her physiological responses to events.3 Frame 2: Green-bordered images, echoing the color of the rocket itself, figure what Laika's own experiences may have been like on board the spacecraft. On the one hand, the green borders serve to mark which images (in this sequence as well as the pages that follow) correspond to Laika's experiences in the present moment, in contrast to the un- bordered images marking other, non-current or non-actual domains of experience. On the other hand, the borders also evoke, through the met- onymic associations of the color green in this context, the larger Soviet military-industrial complex that launched the rocket in the first place. Hence the borders suggest how Laika's final moments are bounded or limited by the technological apparatus that now contains her. SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="3">158 David Herman Frame 3: As already indicated, the images featuring the woman interact- ing with Laika hark back to the earlier dream or fantasy (is it Laika's, the woman's, or the narrator's?) in which the dog is being cared for and at the same time set free. Frame 4: Bookending the first two images of the woman holding Laika are two unbordered images showing the dog in the present moment. The absence of green suggests a partial uncoupling of Laika (by the dog herself or by the narrator) from the physical environment of the spacecraft; here she is situated in a threshold frame that precedes and follows her imaginary transposition into the empowering world of the fantasy. By contrast, farther to the right, in the sequence of small panels, and anchored in frame 2, two green-bordered images bookend Laika's imagined flight through the night sky (itself situated in frame 3). The first of these two images shows Laika beginning to grimace in discomfort and the second, placed directly above Laika's imagined flight, represents the brutal reality of her actual flight, her body listless, her head lying in a pool of vomit. Through its use of color, shifts in scale, and spatial layout, this sequence thus figures how one and the same set of events can take on multiple, sometimes radically divergent experiential profiles for intelligent agents in storyworlds. Further, the overall impact of the sequence arises from the way it narrates what can happen when the quality or specificity of nonhuman experiences is undervalued or ignored. The ability of graphic narratives to figure such differences of experience, and to prompt a re- thinking of the value hierarchies in which they have been embedded, is the focal concern of my essay. I will explore the range of ways graphic narratives depict the experi- ences of nonhuman animals by supplementing my discussion of Abadzis's text with additional case studies, including installments of Animal Man comics (1965-), Grant Morrison's and Frank Quitely's We3 (2005), and other narratives. Drawing on the study of storytelling practices across media as well as research on the nexus of narrative and mind, I position my test cases along a continuum that stretches from animal allegory and anthropomorphic projection, at one end, to texts like Abadzis's that use words and images in a bid to capture the distinctive texture and ecology of nonhuman experiences, at the other end. In outlining this continuum, and connecting it with recent work in narrative theory as well as the sciences of mind, I also seek to come to terms with how medium-specific properties of graphic narratives impinge on methods of consciousness representa- tion - in this case, methods for representing non-human consciousnesses. In examining such nonhuman experiences, I provide grounds for rethinking prior accounts of narrativity itself - accounts suggesting that part of what makes a text or a discourse amenable to being interpreted as a narrative is its focus on human or human-like characters. But beyond this, I also mean to suggest how scholarship on narrative can be informed SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="4">Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives 1 59 by as well as contribute to the emergent, interdisciplinary field of critical animal studies. As I describe in more detail below, practitioners in this field question assumptions about the primacy of the human, and call for a rethinking of practices based on such assumptions. By investigating how stories in general and graphic narratives in particular can be used to model nonhuman experiences, theorists of narrative can contribute to this same far-reaching project. I argue that narrative affords a bridge between the human and the nonhuman; stories provide this link not merely by allegorizing human concerns via nonhuman animals or en- gaging in anthropomorphic projections, but also by figuring the lived, phenomenal worlds - what the German-Estonian philosopher-biologist Jakob von Uexkiill termed the Umwelten - of creatures whose organismic structure differs from our own.4 Hence research on the forms and func- tions of narrative across media can provide scaffolding for the modes of ideology critique associated with critical animal studies. By modeling the richness and complexity of "what it is like" for nonhuman others, stories can underscore what is at stake in the trivialization - or outright destruction - of their experiences. Transmedial Narratology, Medium-Specificity, and What It Is Like When they founded the field of narratology in the mid- to late 1960s, structuralist theorists of narrative failed to come to terms with an issue that is crucial for the present study - the issue of medium-specificity, or the degree to which narrative practices might be shaped by the expres- sive capacities of a given semiotic environment. By contrast, playing a major role in the advent of "postclassical" approaches to the study of stories - that is, frameworks for narrative inquiry that build on classical, structuralist models but supplement them with concepts and methods unavailable to earlier theorists like Roland Barthes, Claude Bremond, Gerard Genette, A. J. Greimas, and Tzvetan Todorov (see my introduction to Narratologies) - "transmedial narratology" explores how the constraints and affordances associated with particular media bear on the design and interpretation of stories. Taking issue with arguments outlined by theorists such as Bremond, transmedial narratology disputes the notion that th efabula or story level of a narrative, the sequence of situations and events that interpreters work to reconstruct via information presented at the sjuzhet or discourse level, remains wholly invariant across shifts of medium. The postclassical per- spective assumes, instead, that stories have "gists" that can be remediated more or less fully and recognizably - depending in part on the semiotic properties of the source and target media (Herman, "Transmedial Nar- ratology"). Thus, though it would be a real challenge to enact The Iliad SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="5">160 David Herman narrative by means of small bits of debris lying on the ground, without the assistance of written, spoken, or signed language, a more nuanced remediation would be possible in the form of a movie, web-based fiction, or graphic narrative. To extrapolate: given that medium-specific differ- ences among narratives are nontrivial, intertranslation among storytelling media will be more or less possible, depending on the formats involved. Abroad research question for transmedial narratology is how the process of remediation plays out in a given instance, given the constraints and affordances of the media involved. The present analysis addresses a related but narrower question - how the representation of what it is like for (nonhuman) characters to experience events is shaped by medium-specific properties of graphic narratives. To anticipate work on narrative and mind discussed below, I hold that it is part of the nature of narrative to focus on the impact of events on experiencing minds (Herman, Basic Elements 137-60; see also Fludernik, Towards a " Natural " Narratology ). In other words, I assume that across differences of genre, communicative context, and storytell- ing media, instances of the narrative text-type share a common focus on the "what-it's-like" dimension of consciousness - to adapt the ideas of Thomas Nagel. As Nagel has argued, in the case of conscious beings, it is possible to ask what it is like to be (or experience the world as) that sort of being, whether a bat or a butterfly, a hummingbird or a human. In turn, narratives more or less explicitly foreground what it is like for characters to undergo particular experiences - how one or more minds is affected by events taking place in the narrated world, or storyworld. And since graphic narratives recruit from more than one semiotic chan- nel to evoke storyworlds, they allow the broad question that concluded my previous paragraph to be particularized along the following lines: Do graphic narratives afford possibilities for representing consciousnesses not afforded by monomodal or "single-channel" print texts, and vice-versa? When it comes to representing the experiences of intelligent agents in storyworlds, how exactly is information parceled out between the visual and verbal tracks in graphic narratives? And what sorts of issues come into focus when the experiences portrayed in words and images are those of nonhuman rather than human agents? Post-Cartesian Approaches to Narrative and Mind Like the study of narrative across media, work on the interfaces between narrative and mind constitutes a strand within postclassical narratology. In this case, theorists have sought to enrich the original base of structuralist concepts with research on the nature of intelligence that SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="6">Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives 1 6 1 was either ignored by or inaccessible to the classical narratologists, in an effort to throw light on mental capacities and dispositions that provide grounds for - or, conversely, are grounded in - the telling and interpre- tation of stories. In earlier studies I have explored these capacities and dispositions by examining processes of narrative worldmaking, issues of perspective or focalization, the sociocognitive dimensions of face-to-face storytelling, and other aspects of narrative.5 Here, I focus specifically on methods for representing consciousness (in particular, nonhuman consciousnesses) in stories. In the field of narrative studies, scholars such as Dorrit Cohn, Monika Fludernik ( Fictions of Language), Geoffrey Leech and Michael Short, Brian McHale, and Michael Toolan have done groundbreaking work in this area - with Cohn setting an especially influential precedent by attempt- ing to map categories of speech presentation (direct discourse, indirect discourse, free indirect discourse) onto the representation of characters' mental processes. More recently, Alan Palmer has called for a reframing of the "speech-category approach" pioneered by Cohn, arguing that the approach has led analysts to overemphasize the verbal component of characters' thoughts - and to neglect other aspects of fictional minds. But the present analysis targets another problem with earlier work on consciousness representation - the Cartesian dualism which, in my view, informs previous accounts of fictional and other minds.6 I submit that abandoning dualistic models of mind opens the door for an approach to the mind-narrative nexus premised on the continuity rather than the discontinuity between nonhuman and human experiences. Moving away from Cartesian geographies of the mental as interior, immaterial domain, analysts working in the philosophy of mind, in psychology, in robotics and other fields have characterized the mind as distributed across brain, body, and world (Clark, Being There and Supersiz- ing the Mind ; Gallagher; Noe, Perception as Action and Out of Our Heads; Thompson; Torrance; Varela, Thompson, and Rosch). This work suggests that minds are inextricably embedded in contexts for action and interac- tion, and in fact arise from the interplay between intelligent agents and the worlds they inhabit. Particularly relevant in this context are the "enactiv- ist" models of mind that have emerged as part of the broader critique of Cartesian dualism (for a foundational study, see Varela, Thompson, and Rosch). The enactivist approach rejects internalist, "sandwich" models of cognition as an interior buffer space between, on the one hand, perceptual inputs and, on the other hand, output that takes the form of behaviors or actions (Hurley). Instead, mental states can be viewed as both shaped by and contributing to action possibilities, or what Gibson characterized as affordances, more or less tightly imbricated with local environments for SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="7">162 David Herman acting.7 The mind is "action-centered," such that "perception is tangled up with specific possibilities of action - so tangled up, in fact, that the job of central cognition often ceases to exist" (Clark, Being There 50), and the intuitive divisions between perception, action, and cognition no longer hold (36; cf. Noe, Perception as Action). Accordingly, in sharp contrast with Descartes's portrayal of an immaterial mind "in here" that is sepa- rate from - indeed, dichotomously opposed to - the world "out there," enactivist models emphasize how a mind acquires the profile it has by virtue of an organism's ongoing interactions with its larger environment. Scholars of narrative have only begun to explore the implications of these post-Cartesian developments in the sciences of mind. Below I build on a previous attempt to engage with this work (Herman, "Re-minding Modernism"), recalibrating my approach in an effort to come to terms with nonhuman minds in graphic narratives. First, however, I'd like to review how ideas emerging from the field of critical animal studies have provided new ways of understanding the very idea of the nonhuman - and thus the idea of the human. Critical Animal Studies: Key Concerns Contrasting critical animal studies with studies of nonhuman ani- mals in the biomedical sciences, Kimberly W. Benston notes that biomedi- cal researchers use the term animal studies to designate "a wide range of investigative operations employing nonhuman animal bodies, [operations that posit] material resemblance and metaphysical incompatibility be- tween researcher and object of research" (548). By contrast, critical animal studies can be characterized as an "interdisciplinary formation arising in the past three decades that views human/ animal relations as a problem for historical, sociological, and cultural analysis - [and that intervenes] in biomedical animal studies by contesting assumptions of mentalistic and moral difference" (548). As Benston's remarks indicate, this field of inquiry is as multifarious as the range of disciplines and investigative methods that contribute to it; however, a number of key concerns can be identified: 1. A rethinking of the stakes of anthropomorphic styles of animal representation, whereby the specificity of the experiences of nonhuman animals is emptied out and replaced with experiences modeled after and imported from the human domain (Columbat; McHugh). 2. Conversely, an attempt to come to terms, in artworks (Baker) as well as academic studies (Uexkull), with what the world is or might be like for a wide variety of animals. SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="8">Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives 163 3. A reassessment of ideas of the human - and of the nonhuman - in light of research undercutting earlier assumptions about the distinctive- ness of humans vis-a-vis language and tool use, cognition, and complexity of cultural organization (Herzing and White; Wolfe, Zoontologies). 4. A resulting reevaluation of the scope of the concept "person," with some theorists characterizing the idea in a way that cuts across the distinction between humans and nonhumans (Cavalieri); in other words, a deconstruction of value hierarchies premised on the centrality of the human. 5. Exploration of a fundamental inconsistency or contradiction in the way humans relate to other animals; Erica Fudge describes this contradiction, which in Fredric Jameson's terms has the structure of an unresolvable ideological conflict or antinomy, as follows: "We live with animals, we recognize them, we even name some of them, but at the same time we use them as if they were inanimate, as if they were objects. The illogic of this relationship is one that, on a day-to-day basis, we choose to evade, even refuse to acknowledge as present" (8). 6. A debate about the best way to redress the contradiction or an- tinomy described in 5, with some theorists using rights-based discourse (Opotow; Regan; Singer) to promote better treatment of nonhuman ani- mals and others critiquing rights-based ideas of justice to promote instead "a bioegalitarian turn encouraging us to relate to animals as animals ourselves" (Braidotti 526). 8 The present study draws on other research to supplement these six topics, which are already relatively well-established areas of inquiry in the field, with two other emergent concerns. These additional concerns come into focus with the help of the post-Cartesian models of mind dis- cussed above: 7. A cross-species emphasis on the embodied, situated nature of minds of all sorts, and on the agent-environment interactions from which conscious experiences emerge; in other terms, an emphasis on how mind or consciousness, rather than happening "in the head the way digestion happens in the stomach" (Noe, Out of our Heads 7), is something that liv- ing organisms do, by virtue of specific modes of sensorimotor coupling between agent and world.9 8. A linking of the issues mentioned in 7 with the work in com- parative ethology pioneered by Uexkiill, and taken up not only by the philosopher Giorgio Agamben but also by Andy Clark, Alva Noe, Evan Thompson, and other scholars. This synthesis of post-Cartesian ideas SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="9">164 David Herman of mind with ethological work provides grounds for pursuing research premised on the continuity rather than the discontinuity between hu- man and nonhuman experiences. New questions for research, and new metrics of value, emerge when human as well as nonhuman experiences are grounded in agent-environment interactions; across species these interactions differ in quality but not in their basic structure. Working toward a rapprochement between the ideas from critical animal studies and the developments in postclassical narratology synop- sized here, I would like now to outline a general framework for studying the portrayal of nonhuman experiences in graphic narratives, situating test cases within that framework. The challenge is to bring the diverse practices of graphic storytellers into relation with a core insight of post- Cartesian research: that the lived, phenomenal worlds of nonhuman agents emerge, in species-distinctive ways, from the same agent-environment interactions that give rise to humanly experienced worlds. Figuring Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives As Kai Mikkonen notes, graphic narratives stimulate "the viewer's engagement of the minds of characters by recourse to a wide range of ver- bal modes of narration in dynamic relation with images that show minds in action" (302). Besides examining how styles of focalization project mental states and dispositions in graphic narratives told in the third- as well as the first-person, Mikkonen explores how the visual channel can be used to prompt inferences about characters' minds by situating them in particular physical and social contexts, with or without additional verbal cues. But what about graphic narratives featuring the experiences of nonhuman characters? My suggestion is that these narratives underscore how earlier frameworks for analyzing modes of consciousness representation need to be rethought from the inside out, so to speak - both in general and in connection with particular storytelling media. To begin substantiating this claim, let me turn to the study men- tioned above (Herman, "Re-minding Modernism"). That study argued that prior narratological work on consciousness representation is premised on a Cartesian polarity between the mind in here and the world out there - a polarity expressed as an internal-external scale separating the interior, immaterial domain of the mind from the wider, sociomaterial world of action and interaction. In lieu of this scale, I outlined a post-Cartesian continuum stretching between, not inner and outer worlds, but between "fine-grained" and "coarse-grained" representations of how intelligent SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="10">Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives 165 AN/TR FN/FID/IM &lt; &gt; Coarse-grained Representation Fine-grained Representation of Agent-Environment Interactions of Agent-Environment Interactions AN = Authorial Narration TR = Thought Report FN = Figural Narration FID = Free Indirect Discourse IM = Interior Monologue Figure 2. A Post-Cartesian Continuum for Consciousness Representation agents negotiate opportunities for action in their environments. Figure 2 represents the continuum at issue, and in figure 3 below I use this scale to generate a parallel continuum - a continuum of strategies for representing nonhuman experiences. Novelists of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, such as Field- ing and Dickens, characteristically rely on what Stanzel terms authorial narration, as well as indirect discourse or thought report. Authorial nar- ration, where the recounting of events ranges freely over the entire world of the narrative rather than being anchored in a particular mind situated somewhere in that world, portrays agent-environment interactions at a relatively gross or global level of detail - as is also the case when char- acters' thought-contents are reported via an external or authorial source. By contrast, modernist texts portray agent-environment interactions in a more fine-grained, detailed way, whether through figural narration, free indirect discourse, or interior monologue. Figural narration, exploited by writers ranging from Kate Chopin to Franz Kafka, features third-person or heterodiegetic reporting, yet dramatizes the impact of events on a par- ticularized center of consciousness, and free indirect discourse and interior monologue likewise work to embed characters' subjectivities in broader circumstances within story worlds. Thus, despite the critical commonplace that modernist fiction turns inward to probe psychological depths, tech- niques associated with modernist narratives should be viewed instead as methods for staging how the mind is spread abroad, or situated in larger contexts. Located near the right side of the scale in figure 2, modernist techniques highlight how minds interlock, on a moment-by-moment basis, with surrounding experiential environments - via the particular affordances or opportunities for action that those environments provide. SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="11">166 David Herman Note how shifts along this post-Cartesian continuum help account for the power and impact of the sequence from Laika presented in figure 1. The use of the framing image of the rocket, a representational mode positioned toward the left end of the scale in figure 2, portrays the isolated and isolating nature of Laika's overall situation. Meanwhile, the inclusion of the smaller images of Laika corresponds to a shift rightward along the scale; this sequence of mini-panels portrays in a more fine-grained way what it may have been like for Laika to experience the deteriorating condi- tions inside the cockpit. But there is then a shift back toward the left end of the continuum: as one moves through the last of these mini-panels in sequence they diminish in size, not only underscoring Laika's tiny stature relative to the rocket but also suggesting the dying, uncomprehending dog's ever more circumscribed agency within the storyworld as a whole. More than providing a post-Cartesian vocabulary for characterizing Abadzis's portrayal of Laika's last moments, however, the scale in figure 2 also suggests a way of constructing a taxonomy of methods for present- ing nonhuman experiences. By analogy with figure 2, figure 3, which lists example narratives corresponding to different increments along the scale, presents a continuum of narrative strategies for representing nonhuman encounters with the world.10 At one end of the scale, in parallel with autho- rial narration and thought report in figure 2, are accounts that encompass nonhuman experiences but remain anchored in humans' own interactions with their environment; these accounts thus present nonhuman minds in relatively summative, globalizing terms - as refracted through human- centered practices and values. At the other end of the scale, in parallel with figural narration, free indirect discourse, and interior monologue in figure 2, are accounts designed to anchor interpreters in (a conception or model of) what it is like for nonhuman agents to interact with their environment on a moment-by-moment basis; these accounts represent nonhuman experiences in a more detailed, granular way.11 Maus Pride of Baghdad Animal Man Laika, Wei AA AP ZP UE &lt; &gt; Coarse-grained Representations of Fine-grained Representations of Non- Nonhuman Experiences human Experiences AA = Animal Allegory AP = Anthropomorphic Projection ZP = Zoomorphic Projection UE = Umwelt Exploration Figure 3. A Continuum of Strategies for Representing Nonhuman Experiences SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="12">Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives 167 To use the terms of metaphor theory (Lakoff and Johnson), the representational strategies situated at the left end of the continuum map the source domain of human experience more or less fully onto the tar- get domain of nonhuman minds. In animal allegory, nonhuman animals function as virtual stand-ins for humans, by way of cultural associations that have accrued around particular species (compare Aesop's fable of the ant and the grasshopper; see also Suzanne Keen's contribution to this issue). In anthropomorphic projection, relative to animal allegory there is an ostensible shift of focus away from the human to the nonhuman; but human motivations and practices continue to be used as the template for interpreting nonhuman behavior. Moving rightward along the continuum to what I have termed zoomorphic projection, animal experiences and ca- pabilities are again translated into human terms, but now for purposes of comparison rather than explanation; this narrative strategy shows what it would be like for human characters to take on nonhuman attributes. This process of translation and comparison may be partial and temporary, as in some of the Animal Man comics I discuss below, or more thorough-going, as in the tradition of transformation stories that extends from Apuleius's The Golden Ass to Kafka's Metamorphosis and beyond. Finally, in what I have labeled Umwelt exploration, there is once more a shift of gravity rela- tive to its neighbor, in this case zoomorphic projection. In describing this fourth strategy, I draw on Uexkull's Umwelt concept to suggest how the emphasis is less on the translation of the nonhuman into the human than on the lived, phenomenal worlds of nonhuman animals themselves - and on how a concern with nonhuman ways of encountering the world can reshape humans' own modes of encounter. Thus far, I have related the scale in figure 3 to two of the main con- cerns of this essay: issues of consciousness representation and ideas from critical animal studies. In other words, I have characterized the continuum in medium-neutral terms. But how can my third major concern - the mat- ter of medium-specificity - be factored into the analysis? To address this question, I turn now to some particular case studies. Encountering the Nonhuman: Graphic Case Studies I assume that individual panels in graphic narratives capture time- slices of an unfolding storyworld, and that the design of panels as well as panel sequences reflects a more or less detailed, ground-level repre- sentation of what characters' own encounters with the storyworld are like. Hence, to tailor the continuum shown in figure 2 to medium-specific attributes of graphic narratives, one needs to determine the degree to which the visual- verbal organization of panels and larger sequences seeks to capture the phenomenology or experiential texture of characters' en- SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="13">168 David Herman gagement with the storyworld. Further, when the characters at issue are nonhuman, then the metric that informs the continuum in figure 3 also comes into play; readers must assess the extent to which the design of panels and panel sequences zooms in on the moment-by-moment qual- ity of nonhuman experiences, as opposed to presenting them in a more globalizing or summative (and human-centric) way. In the subsections below, moving rightward along the continuum in figure 3, 1 will briefly characterize graphic narratives - or segments of graphic narratives - po- sitioned near each increment on the scale. Animal Allegory Art Spiegelman' s Maus at once exemplifies the case of graphic ani- mal allegory and comments reflexively on the deployment of nonhuman agents for allegorical purposes. Using the visual track to present Nazi soldiers as cats, Jews as mice, non-Jewish inhabitants of Poland as pigs, soldiers in the U.S. army as dogs, and so forth, Spiegelman does not focus on these nonhuman agents per se, but rather uses cultural associations and attested behavioral patterns of the animals to structure his narrative about Vladek Spiegelman' s and others' experiences during the atrocities of the Holocaust.12 Here there is no detailed engagement with the lives of Fig 4.

Thus, in figure 4, the story world is clearly human-scale, with street cars, swastikas, and posters offering a reward for Jews in hiding. In this sequence, Vladek can be seen wearing a pig mask to evade capture, and on board the streetcar itself the masked Vladek is seated near cat-faced Germans as well as a Pole (= pig) in a Nazi uniform. In other words, the animal faces are used in the visual channel as a rapid, economi- cal way to encode patterns of conflict (and dangerous, life-threatening encounters) in the human domain - situations and events that would otherwise have to be spelled out in more prolix fashion in the verbal chan- nel. At the same time, by having a mouse feign the appearance of a pig to gain acceptance (or at least escape detection) in a storyworld controlled by ferocious cats, Spiegelman includes a metanarrative comment on the logic of masking that underlies his own animal allegory. Maus is, in short, self-consciously removed from the lived, phenomenal worlds of the crea- tures it uses as means for representing - and interrogating - structures of conflict in the human world. Anthropomorphic Projection In her contribution to this special issue, Suzanne Keen discusses the anthropomorphized faces (and other human-like behavior13) of the lions featured in Brian K. Vaughan's and Niko Henrichon's Pride of Baghdad (2006), which focuses on a pride of lions that escaped from the Baghdad Zoo after an American bombing raid during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. However, whereas Keen explores how anthropomorphizing techniques relate to issues of narrative empathy, my concern here is with how such modes of representation fit within a larger array of strategies for figuring nonhuman experiences. In this context, it is important to note the contrast between graphic animal allegories like Spiegelman's and texts like Pride of Baghdad that use strategies of anthropomorphic projection to engage with nonhuman experiences. In such texts, as figure 5 suggests, nonhuman animals are no longer used merely to represent human institutions and practices; rather, the center of narrative gravity shifts, producing a more textured portrayal of a story world-as-encountered-by-other-animals. Thus the large size of the first panel in this two-page sequence figures the initial shock effect that the exploding bomb must have had for the lions, even as the motion lines in this panel and the next convey the physical impact of the SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="15">170 David Herman Fig 5.

Likewise, the final panel in the sequence is organized along a diagonal axis, suggesting the disorienting, world-disrupting power of a second bomb explosion, which sends the lions careening toward safety. At the same time, however, Vaughan and Henrichon draw on a long tradition of anthropomorphized animal representations when they use speech bal- loons to confer on the lions a capacity for human language (but see my discussion of Morrison's and Quitely's We3 below). The lions' use of verbal language, coupled with the human-like facial expressions discussed by Keen, offsets the other, less human-centric elements of the panels and panel sequences mentioned above. Accordingly, despite sketching a ground- level presentation of what the bombing of the zoo must have been like for the lions, the text also invites readers to construe their experiences via models drawn from the human domain - at the risk of flattening out, or even voiding, the phenomenological specificity of nonhuman encounters with the world.14 SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="16">Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives 1 7 1 Zoomorphic Projection In what I have termed zoomorphic projection, there is another shift in the center of narrative gravity. Here, instead of being imposed as an explanatory template on the domain of the nonhuman, as in animal al- legory and anthropomorphic projection, human practices and experiences become a way of modeling, by analogy, what it is like for nonhuman agents to experience the opportunities for action presented by their larger envi- ronments. The Animal Man comics series exemplifies how the resources of graphic storytelling can be used to narrativize - or rather make possible via narration - cross-species analogies of this sort. Animal Man was a comic first created in 1965 by writer Dave Wood and artists Carmine Infantino and George Roussos, as part of the Strange Adventures series. It was then revived in the late 1980s by the Scottish comic book writer Grant Morrison, in collaboration with (among others) artists Chas Truog and Doug Hazelwood.15 The hero of Animal Man , Buddy Baker, is exposed to radiation after an alien spaceship crashes near him in the woods. At the same time, a train carrying animals bound for a zoo derails, and Buddy thereby discovers his ability to absorb the powers of the nonhuman animals in his immediate environment - including, over the course of his adventures, a bird's ability to fly, a gazelle's leaping ability, the perceptual capacities of a fly, and even the virus-fighting capabilities of white blood cells. Though these zoomorphic transformations are often the subject of Buddy's retrospective narration as well as the thought bal- loons representing his efforts to strategize his way out of tight situations, the lived, physical effects of such transformations feature prominently in the visual track. For example, on one page from a 1967 installment of the comic, a jagged yellow halo represents the force field that Buddy Baker acquires from an electric eel, with the subsequent panels dramatizing what opportunities for action would present themselves if one possessed an eel's power to transmit powerful electric shocks - for example, in order to stun fleeing criminals.16 But it is not just Buddy Baker who is subject to zoomorphic projection in these comics. In the fourth installment of Grant Morrison's revival of the Animal Man series (originally published in 1988), a character named B' Wana Beast has the power to communicate with other species and also merge species together to create composite creatures. When his compan- ion ape, Djuba, dies as a result of animal experimentation, B'Wana Beast merges Djuba' s dead body with Dr. Myers, the scientist in charge of the research project that exposed Djuba to a lethal dose of anthrax. Djuba- Myers then learns firsthand what it is like to be subject to the kinds of experimentation performed on nonhuman animals - as shown in the two-page sequence reproduced as figure 6.

If anthropomorphism involves familiarizing the nonhuman, zoomorphism involves defamiliarizing the human - as when the second panel of the second page juxtaposes the merged Djuba-Myers, strapped down on a gurney, against the image of the former Myers in his family portrait. Likewise, if anthropomorphism entails the imposition of human language on species that communicate otherwise, zoomorphism can entail the loss of language by the species assumed to be its rightful possessor - thereby staging a different way of being in the world. Thus, in the final panels of the sequence, as she-he makes a desperate attempt to protest being wheeled into the operating theatre, Djuba-Myers cannot enunciate Myers's former name, managing to say only "Ma Urrs." The visual track focalizes events in a way that hews close to Djuba-Myers' s interactions with an environment in which she-he, like Laika on board Sputnik II, experiences severely circumscribed agency. But here the reduction of agency is doubly profound, because Djuba-Myers is aware of having been moved down in the hierarchy that Myers had exploited and helped maintain - a hierarchy whose topmost level is occupied by those capable of human speech and the forms of domination, technological and other, that it enables.17 Umwelt Exploration My focus in "Re-minding Modernism" was on the way early- twentieth-century writers were, in effect, intraspecies Umwelt explorers, using methods of consciousness representation to examine variations in the way differently situated humans enact different phenomenal worlds. Here my concern is with strategies for representing interspecies rather than intraspecies variations in experience. In this vein, the strategies that I group under the heading of "Umwelt Exploration" are methods used in graphic narratives to emulate, with as much granularity or detail as possible, how other animals engage with their surrounding world. In my opening discussion of Laika, I suggested that Abadzis uses color, shifts in scale, and panel arrangement to emulate what it was like for Laika to be launched into space - to figure her Umwelt within a larger environment that was experienced very differently by the humans who conducted the launch. Another graphic narrative engaging in Umwelt exploration of this sort is Morrison's and Quitely's We3 (2005), which again uses a variety of techniques to portray what it would be like for animals to experience being conscripted into humans' scientific-technological SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="20">Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives 1 75 endeavors. This time the story concerns three pets that went missing - a dog, a cat, and a rabbit - and were transformed into computer-enhanced "biorgs," as part of an army of "efficient animal slaves" designed to take the place of humans in warfare. Their bodies encased in armor, and pumped full of medication enabling them to tolerate their biorg enhancements, the animals are set free by the woman charged with their care when she learns that they are to be "decommissioned." Portraying a scenario strikingly similar to the one depicted in figure 5 above, from Pride of Baghdad, figure 7 shows the dog (formerly known as Bandit, now as 1) and the cat (Tinker, or 2) fleeing from the security forces who pursue them. (The rabbit, Pirate or 3, has already been killed at this point in the narrative.) As with the lions in Pride of Baghdad, speech balloons indicate that 1 and 2 have the capacity for human speech. Here, however, that ca- pacity derives from computer augmentation, and it produces the minimal vocabulary and irregular syntax reminiscent of cruder speech-synthesis systems - or perhaps of the text fragments that are generated through interaction with a computer console. In other words, the premise of the narrative is that l's and 2's computer-mediated utterances are the result, not of older storytelling conventions associated with animal tales, but rather of actions plausibly and naturalistically rooted in the structure of this science-fictional storyworld. In the context of that narrative world, l's and 2's experiences take shape in the way they do because of the characters' species-specific sen- sorimotor repertoires and the affordances that those repertoires make possible. The smell of helicopter exhaust, for example, affords 2 an opportunity for flight - with die second panel visually reinforcing the fear-causing proximity of the pursuers and the third panel conveying the headlong urgency of l's and 2's downhill run. Yet as the characters' speech performances also suggest, We3 thematizes what happens when human technologies alter the manner in which other organisms are coupled with their environment. Hence, in the penultimate panel in the sequence, 1 registers the exogenous quality of the experiences to which the now-damaged armor or "bad coat" has given rise. 1 characterizes the armor as "not 'Bandit'" - the scare quotes around the dog's former name underscoring the disorientation that comes from l's having to straddle two phenomenal worlds, two differently structured Umwelten. In this way, the text reveals a fundamental tension between its structure and its themes. At a thematic level, the narrative suggests how technol- ogy is premised on, or aims for, a subjection of the nonhuman. But the structure of We3 suggests how narrative itself constitutes a very different sort of (cultural) technology - a system for creating, transforming, and aggregating worlds that allows for the accommodation, rather than the subordination, of nonhuman experiences.

It suggests how, going forward, the study of narrative across media can both inform and be informed by developments in critical ani- mal studies as well as the sciences of mind. But arguably, my preliminary sketch already provides grounds for rethinking one of the core concepts of narrative theory: namely, the idea of narrativity, or what makes a text more or less amenable to being interpreted as a narrative in the first place. In previous work, I echoed theorists such as Fludernik and Jerome Bruner in proposing that a key factor contributing to narrativity is a focus on human or human-like individuals experiencing events in story worlds (Herman, Basic Elements 105-36). As Fludernik puts it, narrative "reflects a cognitive schema of embodiedness that relates to human existence and human concerns. The anthropomorphic bias of narratives and its cor- relation with the fundamental story parameters of personhood, identity, actionality, etc., have long be noted by theoreticians of narrative and have been recognized as constituting the rock-bottom level of story matter" (Towards a "Natural" Narratology 9). 18 But the present analysis indicates that an increasingly detailed engagement with the lived texture of non- human experiences - a movement rightward along the scale shown in figure 3 - does not necessarily result in a diminishment of narrativity. Rather, as suggested by some of the graphic narratives discussed here, in stories figuring the moment-by-moment experiences of nonhuman ani- mals, narrativity is constituted on different grounds: in the very attempt to imagine how a different kind of intelligent agent might differently negotiate - enact - the world.19 Ohio State University Notes 1. Among the sources that Abadzis drew on for historical information are Dubbs and Sid- diqi. 2. For further details, see http: / / www.moscowanimals.org / laika / laika.html 3. Here one might also mention another experiential frame: on a subsequent page, faint television images of Laika appear on monitors in the control room. Those monitors, however, do not seem to be operational during the sequence presented in figure 1, which occurs just after the rocket reaches orbit. 4. In Uexktill's words: 'The Umwelt of any animal that we wish to investigate is only a section carved out of the environment [Umgebung] which we see spread around it - and this environment is nothing but our own human world. The first task of Umwelt research is to identify each animal's perceptual cues among all the [potential] stimuli in its envi- ronment and to build up the animal's specific world with them [...] As the number of an animal's performances grows, the number of objects that populate its Umwelt increases. It grows within the individual life span of every animal that is able to gather experiences" (13; 48). 5. See Herman, Basic Elements ; "Beyond Voice and Vision"; "Storytelling." SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="24">Nonhuman Experiences in Graphic Narratives 1 79 6. For further arguments along these lines, and for further discussion of how scholars of narrative might draw on the research discussed in my next paragraph, see Herman, Introduction to The Emergence of Mind and "Re-minding Modernism." 7. Fransisco J. Varela, Evan Thompson, and Eleanor Rosch suggest that "Stated in precise terms, affordances consist in opportunities for interaction that things in the environment possess relative to the sensorimotor capacities of the animal. For example, relative to certain animals, some things, such as trees, are climbable or afford climbing. Thus af- fordances are distinctly ecological features of the world" (203). 8. As Cary Wolfe puts it, synopsizing some of Cora Diamond's work, "What the rights tradi- tion misses, in [Diamond's] view, is that the 'capacity to respond to injustice as injustice' depends not on working out (from a safe ontological distance, as it were) who should have a fair share of this or that abstract 'good,' based upon the possession of this or that abstract 'interest' or attribute, but rather on 'a recognition of our own vulnerability' - a recognition not demanded and in some sense actively avoided by rights-oriented think- ing" (Introduction 11) . 9. Relevant here are comments that J. M. Coetzee attributes to Elizabeth Costello, the fictional novelist whose lectures on "The Lives of Animals" incorporate material from Coetzee's own Tanner Lectures at Princeton University in 1997-98. Comparing Ted Hughes's poems "The Jaguar" and "Second Glance at a Jaguar" with a poem by Rilke about how being in a cage narcotizes a panther, Costello argues that "The cage has no reality to [Hughes's jaguar], he is elsewhere. He is elsewhere because his consciousness is kinetic rather than abstract: the thrust of his muscles moves him through a space quite different in nature from the three-dimensional box of Newton - a circular space that returns upon itself'" (95). 10. For convenience of reference, figure 3 associates whole narratives (i.e., entire texts) with various positions along the scale. However, as my discussion of Laika in the pre- ceding paragraph suggests, any given text may use a range of strategies for figuring agent-environment interactions, presenting those interactions with different degrees of detail - that is, at different levels of granularity. Hence figure 3 is itself a relatively low- resolution map; it provides a bird's-eye view of storytelling methods that also need to be studied at the ground level, via shifts of narrative strategy within individual texts. 11. In his pathbreaking study of nonhuman focalization, William Nelles sets up an analogous scale "representing the relative congruence of the animal's consciousness and the nar- rator's representation of it" (192). At one end of this scale there is a merely perfunctory "matching of the discourse to the animal's consciousness"; at the other end, "the narrating limits itself rigorously within the animal's natural and / or conventional sphere of interest and reference" (192). But the scale presented in figure 3 is based on a different metric than Nelles's. Because I assume that all minds, human as well as nonhuman, emerge from agent-environment interactions, I also assume that the portrayal of consciousnesses of all sorts can be situated on one and the same (post-Cartesian) continuum, stretching be- tween relatively coarse-grained and relatively fine-grained representations of how minds both shape and are shaped by the sociomaterial contexts in which they act and interact. 12. In an interview quoted by Jeanne Ewert (92), Spiegelman and Mouly suggested that Spiegelman deployed animal allegory to tell his father's story in a (paradoxical) effort to ward off inauthenticity - namely, the inauthenticity that might have attached to Spiegel- man's account had he tried to represent in a less oblique manner situations and events in which he himself did not directly participate. 13. For example, Keen in her essay in this issue notes that Safa's memory of being gang-raped by several male lions imposes a human-oriented narrative - about violence against wom- en - on the attested mating behavior of adult lions, which differs from that of humans. 14. See, however, Paul Morris, Margaret Fidler, and Alan Costall for empirical work sug- gesting that anthropomorphic projection - that is, imputing to nonhuman agents psy- chological states that are more or less closely modeled after those pertaining to human SubStance #124, Vol. 40, no. 1, 2011</page><page sequence="25">180 David Herman minds - may constitute a default cognitive preference when it comes to interpreting the behavior of nonhumans. 15.

See "Animal-Man and the Mod Gorilla Boss/' in Strange Adventures 201 (June 1967): 10. 17. In my view, the scenario from J.P. Strassen's Deogratias that Keen discusses in her con- tribution to this issue as an instance of "dehumanization" is better described as a special case of zoomorphic projection. In this context the term dehumanization suggests that, in being aligned with nonhuman animals, humans undergo some sort of loss or degrada- tion, whereas the term zoomorphic projection is a more value-neutral term - suggesting merely the mapping of nonhuman attributes onto human agents. 18. In the same study, Fludernik goes on to define narrativity as "mediated human expe- rientiality" (26), suggesting that "human experientiality is the topic of narrative" (37) and that "the representation of human experience is the central aim of narrative" (37). 19. 1 am grateful to Jared Gardner and Lisa Kiser for their gracious assistance with the re- search that informs this essay and their comments on previous drafts of the essay itself.
