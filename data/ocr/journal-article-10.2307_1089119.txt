Our soul leaves the body that is our self (II. 1.4; pace Archil. fr. 5.3 West) and squeaking like a bat (Od. 24.6) flies to the underworld, there barely to exist, reft of light, strength, and joy (cf. Od.. 11.15-19, 29, 94); so the Iliad and Odyssey consistently say. Moreover, this yields the Iliad's moral code, for the presence of countless, ineluctible fates of death makes heroes risk their lives for the ersatz immortality of fame (12.326; cf. Tyrt. fr. 12.32 West). Stark witness to this bleak vision is Achilles' regret, once he has tasted death, that he chose a short life of fame over a long, nameless one (Od. 11.488-491). Yet there is one exception, for Proteus tells Menelaus, when stranded in Egypt, that he will not die, for the gods will give him a care-free lot in Elysium (4.561-569). Whence comes this view, so at odds with that found elsewhere in both epics? J. Puhvel (1969 = 1981: 210-215) has argued for an Indo-european provenance and W. Burkert (1961) for a Greek. Many scholars, however, have thought both name and concept foreign, just as many have suspected of Proteus.1 G. Alford 213 PHOENIX, VOL. 55 (2001) 3-4.

"the west") wherein dead pharaohs, and later commoners too, spend eternity.2 I will not recite arguments that Alford and others have already thoroughly aired; but I do want to lend two props to their view. First, I will show that three small parts of pharaoh's last trip-the heavenly river flowing through the Field of Reeds, the flying ferry wherein he sails, and the boat's backward-glancing helmsman-have left traces elsewhere in the Odyssey. Second, I will show that Egyptian royal succession is the best context for understanding Menelaus' good luck. I will argue that this evidence is best explained by positing Egyptian influence during the Bronze Age that survived into the sixth century in the context of mystery cults. An appendix argues that Homer knew of the annual Nile flood. By themselves these are fine points perhaps not worth noting. Yet that all occur in the Odyssey in contexts that allude to Egypt lends credibility to an Egyptian source for Elysium. This hypothesis, bearing as it does on early European views of the afterlife, is indeed worth our critical gaze. I. WHAT EGYPTIANS THOUGHT OF THE AFTERLIFE First, a word about the evidence. Our earliest pertinent record is the Pyramid Texts, first carved in the fifth-dynasty pyramid of Unas (reigned ca 2375-45), a millennium and a half before Peisistratus (obit. 528/7) ordered a reference-text for performances of epic at the Panathenaea (cf. Cic. De or. 3.137), a millenium before Troy VIIa fell, giving the bards their central theme (ca 1250),3 and perhaps even before Greeks entered the Aegean.4 Moreover, these spells may have been composed long before being written down. There is thus no chance that their actual texts directly influenced Greek belief. However, Egyptian culture is steeped in the past, and the spells never fell out of use, but were embellished first as the Middle Kingdom (2040-1640) Coffin Texts, then, in the eighteenth dynasty (1540-1292) when Egypt was preeminent in the Mediterranean, as the Book ofthe Dead. It is the latter, as we shall see in Part Iv below, that could have influenced Greek epic. In presenting the evidence, I will give each motifs ultimate source in down to his role as water-spirit like Achelous and Thetis-might have been inspired by the feats of Bata in the Egyptian Tale of Two Brothers (I thank Micah Ross for this reference). That a god could be old is itself an indication of non-Greek origin (Burkert 1985: 201). 2Lauth 1867: 5 (the official judgement on Lauth is unflattering; cf. Dawson and Uphill 1972: 164); Nilsson 1950: 619-633; Edwards 1961: 30. The word H'Khatov may come from sbt i3rw, "Field of Reeds": see Griffith 1999, with bibliography (henceforth "bibl."). Hesiod (Op. 171) calls Elysium the "Isles of the blessed" (dicKLceCp = ? Egyptian m3'-brw, the righteous dead): see Krappe 1940; Daniel 1962. Other Near Eastern sources for Elysium have been suggested: for example, Cocco (1955) links the term to Ugaritic sd 'l, "field of God." 3 Hiller 1991, with bibl. 4 Mallory 1989: 66-71.</page><page sequence="3">SAILING TO ELYSIUM 215 the Pyramid Texts as well as the immediate source in the Book ofthe Dead for the good reason that one grasps Egyptian beliefs better the closer to their beginning one looks at them, before successive generations had encumbered them with often extraneous additions. So too Egyptologists publish hieratic texts transliterated into the earlier hieroglyphic script. Many Pyramid Text utterances (for example, 215, 216, 245, 248, 302) say that at death pharaoh's soul or ba (b3) flew heavenward to become immortal as a star, often specifically in the constellation Orion (S3 ), heavenly abode of the god Osiris, Lord of Amenta, the other-world ('Imntt, PT 219 ?186a, 442 ?820).5 Since the eighteenth dynasty the hieroglyph for ba shows a human-headed bird sitting by a smoking incense-bowl (R7 + G53 in A. Gardiner's sign-list), probably as a concrete image of this idea.6 It is an old one, for already the first-dynasty mastaba-tombs helped the dead ascend to the sky,7 and the fourth-dynasty pyramid of Khufu (Cheops), which like many pyramids is aligned with the stars,8 contains a shaft pointed at the time of building (ca 2589-66) from the burial- chamber to the pole-star, Thuban (ax Draconis), and another to Orion to guide the king on his voyage, though precession of the equinoxes has since changed these alignments.9 Mycenaeans would have understood the ba, for they too often saw the soul as a bird.10 For Nile-dwelling Egyptians, the natural vehicle for joining the gods among the stars was a boat, and we hear of one, whose name, "it flies, it alights" (p3s hnis PT 310 ?494b), paints it as a sort of bird," which brings the dead to their new home in the Duat. Starting in the sixth dynasty, the mummy often shared his tomb with scale-model boats to aid him on the trip: the eighteenth-dynasty Tut'ankhamfin, for one, had a fleet of thirty-five.12 Such models were cost-cutting relics of more lavish days, for Khufu and his heir, Chephren, were equipped with five life-sized boats each, perhaps one to carry their bas to the four cardinal points and the fifth the very hearse that bore them to the tomb, for which, after that great service, no lesser use would ever again be worthy. One of these, found disassembled but perfectly preserved south of Khufu's pyramid on 26 May 1954, 5 Faulkner 1966; Jacq 1986: 172-173; Allen 1989; Krauss 1997. Post-Homeric Greeks sometimes view stars as the home of dead souls (e.g., Heraclitus 22 A 15 Diels-Kranz; Eur. Supp. 531-534, Hel. 1014-16): see Lattimore 1942: 26-43, ??3-4. 6 Edwards 1961: 34; Erman and Grapow 1971: 1.411. 7Badawy 1956. 8Its sides face the cardinal points deviating just 3" of arc: see Smyth 1867; Krupp 1978. 9These shafts were not for ventilation, as was once assumed, for they were originally dosed on both ends: see Badawy 1964; Trimble 1964 = 1992: 3-8. 10 Vermeule 1976: 65. 11 Sethe 1948-62: 2.333 ad loc.

Moustafa, is housed in its own museum above the pit where it was buried.13 Powered by five pairs of oars up to 8.5 metres long with two more steering-oars across the stern, it has no mast or sail.14 Its prow and stern rise 7.6 metres above the keel-line, more like those of sea-faring Viking drakkars than the river-craft one expects on the Nile. Though made of cedar of Lebanon, it mimics reed-floats with papyriform finials carved on both ends. The reed-float is remarkably durable.15 T. Heyerdahl (1971) sailed two across the Atlantic, though scholars doubt Egyptians themselves made the trip.16 The bier that bore the scribe Ani to his tomb had just such a papyrus-shaped prow and stern (vignette to BD 1 = Wasserman 1998: plate 5). The place whither pharaoh sails is a realm of earthly delights, an ideal form of the Nile's banks, which by the eighteenth dynasty Egyptians were calling the Field of Offerings (sht /tpw) or, as we have said, the Field of Reeds. The Book of the Dead makes clear that at this time too the dead arrived there by boat (58 ?1-7, 110 ?12). II. HOW MENELAUS GOT TO ELYSIUM While not saying how the gods will send Menelaus to Elysium, Proteus clearly implies that he will arrive alive and in the flesh. We note, too, that Homer calls the Nile as well as several other rivers 8ttnctcog toaxtoto (Od. 4.477, 581, etc.), usually translated, "sky-fallen (i.e., rain-fed) river" (for example, LSJ s.v. 6tttmctiV). H. Liders (1959: 1.11) quotes a similar passage in the ?4gveda (rttm sindhavo varunasya yanti .. v'yo nt paptz~ raghuyat parraman, "the rivers run by Varuga's commandment ... swift have they flown like birds in air around us," 2.28.4) and moots that Homer's phrase really means "river flying in the sky," "heavenly river" (cf. Hymn. Hornm. Ven. 4; Nonnus Dion. 5.200). While accepting this, I have argued elsewhere (1997a) that it is no vestige of an Indo-european poetic formula like the pair Kcog ; 0i4tzov (II. 9.413, etc.) / iralvas aiksitam (4?gveda 1.9.7, etc.),17 as Liders thought, but refers instead to the annual Nile-flood, of which the epic bards knew (see Appendix). The earthly Nile has an echo in the sky to which the Pyramid Texts often allude (263 ?340d, 359 ?594b, etc.; CT 18, etc.). Some scholars transcribe its name as mr n h3, "waterway of destruction," and others, using different word-division, as mr nh3, "winding (i.e., crooked) waterway." V. L. Davis (1985) adopts the latter reading, but translates as "shifting 3 Kadry 1986, with bibl.

R. Krauss (1997: 53-54) sees this watercourse as a reference instead to the invisible, imaginary line of the ecliptic. Whatever its astronomical referent, it was the way on which-over two and a half millennia before Lucian claimed that his sailors crossed the sky (Ver. hist. 1.9-10; cf. Antonius Diogenes apud Phot. Bibl. 111a)-Egypt's pharaohs rode "it flies, it alights" to the stars.19 This idea still lived in the eighteenth dynasty, for the Hymn to the sun-disk (itn) from the tomb of Ay at Amarna speaks of an "inundation in heaven" (4'py m p.t).20 Nor is the sky-river the Odyssey's only debt to Egypt, for in a context rich in Egyptian echoes, like ghosts who tell the truth if properly fed (11.95-96)21 and a cattle-ranching sun-god (11.108-109; cf. 1.8-9; 12.127-141),22 Teiresias tells Odysseus that death will come to him from the sea amid folk who have never known "well-fitted oars, which are wings for ships" (6-i1pc' Apszc d, z6 te 7ztcp&amp; vrluoal t6kovtat, 11.125 = 23.272).23 This strikes us, for epic, fond of similes, tends to shun metaphor.24 It also lacks precedent in Greek. True, from the Late Helladic IIIC period Greeks painted eyes on ships' prows (Aesch. Pers. 559; Supp. 716; Siren Painter ARV2 289,1),25 and their verse treats ships as living things, rejoicing (&amp;yakX6ievat), for example, in a breeze of Zeus (Od. 5.176) or even speaking (Aesch. fr. *20 TrGF; Pherecydes 3 F 111a FGrH; Ap. Rhod. 1.526; 4.580-583; Catull. 4.2).26 Yet when we can assign species to these sentient boats, we find them to be horses rather than birds.27 So we have "horses of the salt (sea)," (&amp;k(X; 'Yot, Od. 4.708; cf.

Like a calm pool the sky mirrors the earth, being split into "two heavens" (p.ti) echoing the "two lands" (t3.wi) of Upper and Lower Egypt. 211 have argued (1997b) that this idea stems from an Egyptian source, the ttp di nsw.t formula, meaning "der K6nig sei gnidig und gebe": Erman and Grapow 1971: 3.186. 22 Helios has 350 cattle (Od. 12.129-130), the days of the year reckoned in a septimal system (= 7 times 50). His Egyptian counterpart has seven cows (BD 148), the sarcophagus of Chensuemrenpa in the Munich Museum shows the solar barque drawn by four beasts called "white cows of the sun-god" Chs3t /dw n R'), and in Genesis pharaoh dreamed of seven cows (41:1-36). See Lauth 1867: 4-5; Sayed et al. 1980: 357-390. Ugas' car is also drawn by ruddy kine (4?gveda 1.92.2; 124.11; 5.80.3). 23 For Homer's noun-epithet formulae for "ships," see Parry 1971: 109-113; Alexanderson 1970 (neither mentions the oar-wings). For relative pronoun + ts, see Ruijgh 1971: 358-452; nt'kovrat is here used metri causa for the syntactically correct nc'kstat. 24 Stanford (1936: 135) calls it one of Homer's "first undoubtedly imaginative metaphors." 25Cf. the Late Helladic IIIC stirrup-jar from Scyros shown in Boardman 1974: 107. For other illustrations of ships, see Casson 1975, with bibl.

Both ships and horses belong to Poseidon, horse-taming (II. 23.277, etc.) god of the sea (15.187-193, etc.), and the wooden horse that loosed Troy's coronal (Od. 4.271-289; 8.499-520; 11.523-532) is ship-like.28 If first attested in the Odyssey, the bird-ship soon came into vogue, and so many non-Homeric texts speak of ships' wings that we find the metaphor almost inevitable. That it is at bottom unnatural, however, we see from other poets, who tend to give the bird-ship sails not oars for wings.29 (The Odyssean view was original, for both comparative linguistics and archaeology show that rowing- itself refined from more primitive paddling-predates sailing.)30 The metaphor is at odds with much Greek cosmology, for it implies a watery sky, known in the Near East (for example, Eniema elis IV 137-140 [= p. 67ANET3]; Genesis 1:6-7, 7:11-12; II Kings 7:2, 19; Psalms 104:3, 13; 148:4; Revelation 4:6) and Egypt (cf. mr nh3, 'py mp.t) and perhaps even in proto-Indo-european, but not to Greeks, who typically thought the sky a solid bronze or iron vault.31 Pharaoh sailed to the afterlife on a boat aptly named "it flies, it alights," even in the eighteenth dynasty, for we read in the Book of the Dead of the "beautiful rudder of heaven" (4my nfr n p.t) that belongs to the pilots of the Duat (148 ?8), and ten oars were set beside Tut'ankamfn's coffin. A literally winged ship was ideal to reach the gods on a sky-river, and ships bore things to and from gods in ritual, both Egyptian and Greek. Painted pots of the predynastic Na1da ii period show ships bearing movable structures, seeming ancestors of the elegant cabins of Khufu's and later craft. These sport emblems like the banner flying on a pole, which was in historic times the determinative for ntr, "god" and ntry, "sacred," and so, E. J. Baumgartel (1955: 1.11-14) suggests, served religious ends, being best called "chapels." In the historic period, Egyptians housed gods' images in portable shrines, which they called inter alia db3.t, "shrine,"32 and Greeks vaoi (Hdt. 2.63; Diod. Sic. 1.15.3), that they carried on feast-days out of the sanctuary among the people, as Hindus do in the festival (the aspirate was confined to Attic [Aul. Gell. 2.3.2]; cf. rFa6iCUKtno, AE6K1tnno); also Linear Bpo-ro = Inokog (KN 82). Despite the later fame of Egypt's cavalry (II. 9.382-384; Genesis 47:17; Exodus 9:3, 14:9), she had no horses before the Hyksos period, when she named them ssm.t (&lt; Semitic; cf.

Most important were the boat-shrines of the Theban triad-Amun, Mut, and Khonsu-borne in procession on New Year's day from Karnak to the Nile, towed to Opet (ip.t "the harem [of Amun]," modern Luxor) to receive sacrificial geese from offering-tables,33 then returned (Diod. Sic. 1.97.9), a festival of unclear meaning, perhaps a sacred marriage (iEpb6q ydoc) of Amun and Mut,34 whose prestige was enhanced, when a century before Troy fell Amenhotep III (arguably the Memnon of the Greeks)35 adorned the temple until "its towers reach[ed] heaven, and mingle[d] with the stars" and replaced Amun's boat-shrine with an electrum-plated one of cedar.36 The "good (or beautiful) festival" (?b nfr) of Opet enjoyed broad influence, perhaps inspiring the Ark of the Covenant that Israelites paraded in a cart (II Samuel 6:1-5). The Bible calls this object 'aron (Numbers 10:35, etc.), but in post-Biblical Hebrew tebah denotes the box that holds the Torah-scroll in a synagogue (hence its other meaning, "word"). Tebah is a quasi-nautical term denoting Noah's ark (Genesis 6:14) and the chest in which baby Moses' mother exposed him (Exodus 2:3). That it was the first name for the Ark is suggested by Ge'ez, the Ethiopian liturgical tongue, which calls the Ark tabot (Kebra nagast ch. 48, etc.), a word derived, via Aramaic, from tebah.37 Given the Jews' sojourn in Egypt, scholars derive tebah in turn from Egyptian db3. t,38 also sailors' cant, for a god can "sail his shrine" (4nti db3. t),39 though some once thought that the derivation went the opposite way.40 An Opet-like festival was also held on Bronze-Age Thera,41 whose North African ties, says Pindar, go back to the Argonauts (Pyth. 4.42-43; Ap. Rhod. 4.1731-64; cf. Hdt. 4.179). Greeks, too, may have known the Opet-festival: they had met Amun, though perhaps not before the foundation of Cyrene (modern Al Jabal al Akhdar) with its oracle in 630 (cf. Pind. Pyth. 4.16; 9.51; frs. 36, 58 Maehler),42 they carefully watched the heliacal rising of Sirius (II. 5.5-6; cf. Hes. Op. 417),43 33 For geese associated with Amun, see Guglielmi and Dittmar 1992. For Egyptian offering-tables, see Habachi 1977. Despite the prominence of altars in their religion, Greeks too used offering-tables, esp. in Mycenaean times: see Gill 1991; Cox 1996. 34Bleeker 1967: 78. 35 Griffith 1998, with bibl. 36 Many surviving shrines are published in Roeder 1914.

Whether inspired by the Opet-feast or not, Greeks used boats, sailed, carried like litters, or mounted on wheels, to bring divine images or of- ferings to and from temples, notably while giving Athena her rtitoXo; in the Panathenaea, and also during the feast of Dionysus at Smyrna, and the 0cwopia to the Delian Apollo.46 The latter involves the very ship (cf. P1. Phd. 58a10-cl; Plut. Thes. 23.1) that once bore Athens' tribute to the labyrinth and its Minotaur (Simon. 550 PMG; Bacchyl. 17.1-116)-not im- mortal, for Theseus would slay him, but the only Greek figure who re- calls Egypt's animal-headed gods. Though scholars debate when the Pana- thenaic rite began (the ship is missing from the east frieze of the Parthenon of 432, for example), it is of indisputably ancient lineage (I1. 6.86-98, 263-310; Alcman 1.61 PMG, PMGF = 3.61 Calame; Paus. 3.16.2; 5.16.3).47 More- over, such rituals may underlie the Homeric Hymn to Dionysus, which describes the god's ship-board epiphany (2; cf. Exekias ABV 146,21).48 Some Greek bards even imagined temples as a kind of ship, as I (forthcoming) argue else- where. Describing Daedalus fleeing Crete, Vergil inverts Homer's metaphor as "the oars of wings" (remigium alarum, Aen. 6.19; cf. Ov. Met. 8.228),49 and euhemer- izing accounts say that he sailed rather than flew, having invented sails, not wings (Paus. 9.11.4-5; Diod. Sic. 4.77.6).

Greeks owed to Egypt a crucial naval technology, for the papyrus used in ropes, rigging, and tackle (~SXov ... P6PIivov, Od. 21.390-391), sleek substitute for the clumsy native strips of ox-hide (poe6g, 2.426; 12.423; Hymn. Hom. Ap. 407; cf. Cato Agr. 3.5, 12, 63) as paper later was for parchment, must (pace Eustath. ad Od. 21.390-391) have come from there (cf. Hdt. 2.35; 7.25, 34; Hermippus fr. 63.12-13 PCG).53 I suggest that Greeks also took thence the image of ships flying with oar-wings on lofty rivers to bring souls to the gods. In so doing, they radically secularized it, not least because, save Hermes the psychopomp and Hades, their gods brooked no contact with the dead (Aesch. Sept. 217-218; Eur. Alc. 22, Hipp. 1437-38; Plut. Ant. 75.3-4) or even graves (Thuc. 3.104.1; Polyb. 8.30; Paus. 1.43.3), whence the evocatio-like theft of the Palladium from Troy let them slaughter Trojans (Serv. ad Aen. 2.166; Sil. Ital. 13.36-50). This aversion is elsewhere linked to sailing, for Athenian courts could put no one to death until the theoric ship came back from Delos (P1. Phd. 58b; Xen. Mem. 4.8.2). As with other such loans, we may suspect Semitic middlemen, and the Akkadian hymn to Samas, the Sun-god from Ashurbanipal's (reigned 668-633) library at Nineveh says, "You save from the storm the merchant carrying his capital, The .[.]. who goes down to the ocean you equip with wings" (l[6tamka]ru (dam.ga]r) na-ai ki-si ina e-de-e tu-je-zib/ .[.]. a-riddza-nun-ze-e tu-js-d~-kan kap-pa, lines 69-70).54 This is why, when the Odyssey describes the "well-known" (12.70) Argo passing through the Planctae,5 border between the real world of Thessaly and Colchis, Egyptianesque (Hdt. 2.104-105)56 realm of Helios' son, Aeetes (Od. 10.138), where Helios' own bedroom is (Mimnermus fr. 11a West), on its way to fetch home Phrixus' soul (Pind.

Above all, only if the Odyssey knows of "it flies, it alights," can we explain a small part of the Phaeacian story. These folk dwell "near the gods" (&amp;yX'ieOot, 5.35; cf. 7.205-206) midway between the fairytale realm of the Apologue (books 9-12) and the real Aegean.59 Long ago, F. G. Welcker (1832 = 1845: 2.1-79) argued that they were ferry-men of the dead. Deriving their name from 4xt6g, "dusky," "dun," or "gray," for mist is prominent in their episode (8.568 = 13.150, 176, cf. 189), he and his followers linked them to the Gray Men who ferry the dead by night to the island of Brittia in Teutonic myth (cf. Procop. Goth. 4.20.48-58; Tzetzes ad Hes. Op. 171; ad Lyc. 1204). They noted that Alcinous knows that Odysseus will be asleep when they bring him home (Od. 7.318; and indeed he falls into a sleep "most like death," 13.79-80),60 that we are told for no reason that a former fare was Rhadamanthys (7.323), dweller in the Elysian plain (4.564), and that the chthonic region of Epirus61 contained a town named BatiKrl (St. Byz. s.v. = Hecataeus 1 F 104 FGrH). This theory could also explain why, despite all signs to the contrary, Athena calls the Phaeacians unfriendly (Od. 7.32-33) and why Odysseus, waking befuddled on Ithaca, curses them (13.200-214).62 Repelled by Welcker's claim that Homer borrowed from Germans, scholars have rejected it,63 but E. F. Cook (1992: 252) has shown that one need not accept a German origin for the motif to accept the Phaeacian/ferry-man equation. This is relevant here, for if the Phaeacians are ferry-men of Elysium, we might expect them to have a bird-like boat like their Egyptian counterparts, and indeed Homer likens their ship to a falcon (13.86-87). There is yet a third echo of the Reed-Field in the Odyssey. The pilot of "it flies, it alights" is Mahaf(i.e., M3-43.f), meaning, "Who looks behind"64 (PT 270 ?383 etc.; CT 396; BD 99 passim), "Whose face is behind" (flr.f-3.f, CT 474 ?23c; BD 125), or "Who looks before, who looks behind" (FIr.f-m-hnt-4rf-m-m3.f, PT 310 ?493b). His distinctive pose was still basic in the eighteenth and nineteenth dynasties, as proved by the vignette to the Book of the Dead Chapter 93 in the papyrus of Ani (Wasserman 1998: plate 16), which shows him sitting in his boat, the ladanum-gatherer's three-swippled "flail" (nh3h3) that links him to Osiris (cf. PT 578 ?1535) perched on his knee;65 before him stands the deceased, clad in 59 Segal 1962 = 1994: 12-64. 60 Schwartz (1924: 189, 226), Merkelbach (1969: 211), and Cook (1992: 245) follow Welcker in seeing this sleep as a sign that Phaeacians are ferry-men of death. 61 An Epirote priest showed Hammond (1967: 163) where the river Acheron plunges into Hell. 62 Rose 1969. 63J.

The latter looks over his shoulder, as his ancient name dictates.66 Charon, who mans the tiller of the ferry bearing dead Greeks to their underworld (Minyas fr. 1 Davies, Bernabe; Aesch. Sept. 856-860; Eur. Alc. 438-445; Ar. Ran. 180-208), including Elysium, is also shown once, on a fifth-century Attic white-ground lekythos, looking over his shoulder.67 Homer does not mention Charon, but speaks of Death (II. 16.454, etc.), whom Byzantines called X&amp;poc, or Xdpovtw,--though whether by syncretism or survival of an Ur-identity is unclear.68 That Mahafs weird stance makes him avert his gaze Perseus-like (cf. Eur. Alc. 1118) from his passengers is a by-product, and not its motive cause, for Greek rather than Egyptian gods were wont to shun the dead, and in the vignette to BD 93 (Wasserman 1998: plate 16) just mentioned, Mahaf, as he looks back, trades glances with the late Ani. R. O. Faulkner (1985: 90) suggests that M3-43.f once meant "the stern is behind him," i.e., "helmsman," for, like Charon (Lucian Dial. Mort. 22; cf. Men. 10; Dial Mort. 10), he mans the rudder not the oars of his craft, which is self-propelling, unlike the Phaeacians', which needs rowers (Od. 13.76-78) but no helmsman (8.556-561), and m3 is perhaps the rudder of a sacred boat (.wi3),69 written due to the similar shape by the hieroglyph for "sickle" (U1 on the sign-list). Because m3, "rudder" sounds (assuming the same vocalization, /ma/) like m3, "he sees," the name was early misconstrued, Faulkner contends, as "he who sees behind him." On this view "klr.f-43.f" arose as a gloss, also early, for as we saw above already the Pyramid Texts call the pilot both names. Perhaps ritually enacting Mahafs pose, the priest who leads Ani's boat-shaped bier to the tomb also looks over his shoulder (vignette to BD 1: Wasserman 1998: plate 5). The gondolier's pose is neither comfortable nor natural.70 True, the captives whom the early dynastic king Na'rmer clubs to death on the verso of his commemorative slate palette (Cairo Museum CG 14716) are so depicted, but this conveys their agony.71 Again, a sixteenth-century demotic magical papyrus describes "those who are yonder" (the dead) entering a room with faces reversed to kiss, and perhaps abduct, a woman's sleeping baby (Berlin Papyrus 3027 recto 66Faulkner 1985: 94 with plate; cf. the commentary by O. Goelet in Wasserman 1998: 163. The backward-glancing Mahaf appears also in the late twenty-first-dynasty papyrus BM 10001: see Niwiriski 1989: plate 40b. Another supernatural attendant of the deceased is described as "you the back of whose head is behind him," i.e., who looks straight ahead (PT 321 ?517) to distinguish him from Mahaf. See also Jacq 1986: 46-47. 67Vermeule 1976: 71, fig. 28. 68For example, Trypanis 1951: 86-87, no. 81. See Kriiger 1866; De Ruyt 1932. Homer's Thanatos is more like the stretcher-bearer from a field-hospital than a ferry-man. Cf. Lawson 1909: 98-117. 69Erman and Grapow (1971: 2.6) define m3 as "das Hinterende ... des Schiffes," while Jones (1988: 166-167, no. 63) lists the meaning of m3 as "unknown." 70Some animals, however, are regularly so portrayed: see Hermann 1932. There are also bicephalous figures who look Janus-like both back and front. 71Schafer 1974: plate 8.</page><page sequence="12">224 PHOENIX i 9-ii 6 [= p. 328 ANET3]), but this is an uncanny sign of the revenant, like the demonic "Radiant One who comes out after having turned back" in the underworld (BD 17 ? 105). Egyptologists are divided over the reason for Mahafs pose. D. Mueller (1972: 104) explains it by the need of one rowing a skiff to keep turning round to see; yet as we have said, Mahaf's boat seems to be self-propelling. D. Bidoli (1976: 47-48) notes that Coffin Texts 473 ?3c-d, etc. call the ferry-man a fisher (of the dead), and thinks that he is looking round to check his nets, but this would have to be a later addition, for the name precedes his role as fisher. L. Depuydt (1992: 37) has suggested on the basis of the name, "Who looks before, who looks behind," that the ferry-man has two faces like Janus, while Krauss (1997: 67-85), noting among other things a similarity between the words for "ferry-man" and "moon" (i' -3t and i' ), suggests that Egyptians identified Mahaf with the moon, whose waning crescent points opposite the direction of its celestial motion. Against the last two theories one might argue, as Depuydt (1992: 38) concedes, that the Book of the Dead portrays Mahaf with a single human face. For his part, the commentator, K. Sethe (1948-62: 2.116) explains Mahafs pose by his need to stay on course, absurdly, for in steering one looks forward. Looking back shows whence one has come, also vital when navigating, since landmarks may look different from the other direction-but only if one plans to go home again (steering by reference points, as the track of oar-blades is unclear). This explains why he looks back, since humans, subject to the day, cannot reverse time's arrow and see death as a one-way trip whence they say that no-one returns;72 while as a god, Mahaf travels both ways. Another figure whom Egyptians normally show looking back is the avatar of Osiris' celestial home, Orion.73 They carved the determinative for his name on the north face of the coping-stone (bnbn.t) from Ammenemes III's (reigned 1842-1797) pyramid at Dashur, now in the Cairo Museum, armed with a sceptre, marching forward, turning back, and stretching behind him his left hand, which holds the star.74 He is shown in this pose astride a boat on the star-charts- short shrift versions of the star-targetting shafts of Khufu's pyramid-that adorn the tomb-ceilings of Senmut, major-domo of Hashepsowe (Hatshepsut, reigned 1503-1482) and of Sethos I (reigned 1318-04).75 The star Sirius (Spdt), heavenly home of Osiris' sister/wife, Isis (Plut. Mor. 359c, 365e),76 is called Orion's guide (PT 443 ?822b, 477 ?965; cf. Plut. Mor. 370a), but Sirius actually follows him in the circumvolution of the stars (cf. Avienus Aratea 725) and can be his guide only thanks to the glance with which he turns back toward her.77 72 For the cliche that death is the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveller returns, cf. II. 9.408-409; see further West 1966: 370 ad Hes. Theog. 769-773. 73Wilkinson 1992: 130, fig. 1. 74Maspero 1902.

In time, while moderns look forward, ancients generally were "in the grip of the past,"78 while for them the door of the future was closed. Greek literature abounds in etiologies (for example, Callim. frs. 1-190 Pfeiffer), lauds inventors of the bridle (Athena: Pind. 01. 13.69), lyre (Hermes: Hymn. Hornm. Merc. 25), wine (Icarius: Eratosthenes ap. schol. II. 22.29; cf. Genesis 9:20-21), or the saw (Talus or Perdix: Diod. Sic. 4.76.4-7; Paus. 1.21.4),79 and casts habitual actions, for which moderns use the timeless present, in the simple past or aorist, since a thing is proved generally true by having happened already.80 So, too, as Cicero says (Att. 1.16.1), Homer is fond of hysteron proteron and narrates mythic examples in literally preposterous order (for example, 11. 24.599-620), a habit that peaks in Pindar (especially Pyth. 4). Such an orientation is further implied in the very word "before" (tcdipot09) with both its spatial and temporal meanings. In Hebrew we see such grounding in the past in the phrase P'kladm, which the Septuagint renders as gzc ~i; -,6v aiova, "forever" (for example, Isaiah 30:8), that shares the same triliteral root with the verb 'alam, "to conceal" (Psalms 90:8 etc.), as if eternity were hidden. Egyptian script shows the same thing, for, as with Hittite,81 its hieroglyphs may be written in either horizontal direction, with the therio- and anthropomorphic signs always pointing to the inscription's start whence they have come so that, much to Herodotus' dismay (2.36.4), they face opposite the direction of reading and writing.82 Egyptians also often speak of"the first time," "Urzeit," or "creation" (zp tpi: cf. PT 338 ?551e; BD 9 ?1) as a model for conduct. In space, while Hebrews looked east, so yamin means both "right hand" (Psalms 89:13) and "south" (Exodus 29:22) and semol means "left" (Genesis 48:14) and "north" (Job 23:9), and while Greeks, who later established cartographic conventions (Anaximander 12 A 6 Diels-Kranz), turned north so the Scaean, or left-hand, gates were west of Troy (1. 3.145 etc.), Egyptians faced south to the "God's-land" of Punt and the source of the Nile, which gave them the land itself (Hdt. 2.5).83 Hnti ("southward") and hnti ("to sail south") both come from the 78In B.

This had many results, as that one entered pyramids from the north, facing the chief cardinal point. Notable among these was that facing south, one turned one's back to the pole-star. Around Polaris are tethered (i.e., revolve) the stars that never set. Egyptians called them ibm-sk ("imperishable") unlike the merely "unwearying" (ihm-wrd) ones, while to Greeks they were "not bathed in [the river] Ocean."85 The circumpolar stars give Mahaf his bearings (PT 437 ?802a; 520 ?1222c; 481 ?1000d; 519 ??1201-3) as he brings his fares to live forever with Osiris in Orion.86 The acts of facing so the future, including eternity, is behind and facing so the deathless, unwashed stars of immortality are behind come to the same thing.87 The forward gaze pointing mortals to the past is part of the human condition, for we do not know the future, to which only gods, above all those who grant immortality, can look "back." The Bible tells us not to look at God and His operations, as Lot's wife turned to watch Him lay waste the cities of the plain (Genesis 19:17, 26; cf. Luke 17:32),88 and classical literature links this taboo to the soul's posthumous fate in the tale of Orpheus-merely human, though once an Argonaut (Pind. Pyth. 4.177; Ap. Rhod. 1.23-34; pace Pherecydes 3 F 26 FGrH) and perhaps like Mahaf a fisher of souls (cf. 6p46;6, "great sea perch," Marcellus Sidetes 33)-who failed to resurrect Eurydice when he turned too soon as he led her up from Hades (Verg. G. 4.489-490). The Odyssey's hero spurns the goddess Calypso's request to live with her forever on Ogygia, and opts to go back to humankind, again a Near Eastern motif (cf. Gilgamesh, who rejects I-tar, Gilgamesh 6.22-78 [= p. 84 ANET3], and solstice. Curiously, an equal share of day and night marked the just dispensation of the gods in Sicilian thought also (cf.

Austin 1975: 241. 88 On the taboo against turning around, see Hainsworth in Heubeck et al. 1988: 1.283 ad Od. 5.350, with bibl. The taboo often involves necromancy, e.g., KUB XXVII 67 (iv 3) = ANET3 348b and Od. 10.527-529, which is not what I am considering here. It is God's destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah that Lot and family must not see; I have scant sympathy with Pitt-Rivers's (1977: 136) view that they are to turn their backs on non-endogamous mating practices.</page><page sequence="15">SAILING TO ELYSIUM 227 Hittite heroes who shun Sauska).89 He sets sail, but a storm that wrecks his raft nearly drowns him, and his patron-god and constant helper, Athena, saves him (5.382-387). Before this, Leucothea makes her only appearance (333-365) in a crisis-vision like Shackleton's delusion or the voice that bade Reinhold Messner, alone and freezing high on Everest, make dinner.90 Once the mortal daughter of Cadmus, named Ino, Leucothea had fled her husband Athamas (father by Nephele of Phrixus, whose ghost the Argonauts had laid to rest) by leaping with their baby, Melicertes, into the sea, where "she now shares the lot of the gods" (334) as Leucothea, the "White Goddess," while her son has become the baby-hero, Palaemon, in whose honour the Isthmian games were held (Alcman 50(b) PMG, PMGF = 124 Calame, etc.). Here she offers Odysseus an "immortal" silk(?) veil (Od. 5.346-347)91 that he must bind as a magic life-jacket round his chest to bring him safely ashore. (Interestingly, in PT 696 ?2163 the deceased offers the ferry-man a piece of cloth [szf nnit] as payment for his services.)92 Once there, Odysseus must throw the veil back "into the wine-dark sea" (349) while "himself turning away" (citzbT 6' &amp;nov6~T4 zpcCaOut, 350, cf. 458-462). This shocks us, for the Odyssey elsewhere (11.602-604; contrast 11. 18.117-119) implies that no mortal but Heracles had become a god (cf. ijpcoq 0 c6, Pind. Nem. 3.22; cf. Hdt. 2.44),93 nor does drowning make one immortal as it can in Hellenistic and Christian thought,94 yet it makes theological sense in an Egyptian setting, for the Pyramid Texts hint that Osiris, and so pharaoh after him, suffered a sea-change when the gods deified (sntri, &amp;no0aoiv) him by drowning (cf. 33 ?24d; 364 ?615d; 423 ?766d), an idea still current in New Kingdom times (ca 1540-1075; cf. the Shabaka stone = Denkmal memphitischer Theologie 8, 11a),95 which is why relatives could not touch those found drowned, who were buried instead by Nile-priests (as were victims of crocodiles, which merely finished the river's work, Hdt. 2.90), and also why Greek magical papyri call Osiris and other noyds 'Eotfi (JDAI 32 [1917] 201 [Memphis]; PGM 3.1, 4.875, 5.269, etc.; cf. 89 Giterbock 1983; Crane 1988: 63-85, cited with approval in Morris 1997: 617, n. 63.

De bapt. 5) &lt; Coptic (Sahidic) zxcie, "drowned person"96 &lt; Egyptian 4sii, "praised, favoured." Plutarch, meanwhile, replaces drowning as Osiris' cause of death with the not always fatal Greek motif of exposure in a floating chest (Mor. 356c).97 This brief doublet of Athena's rescue, prompted by no need of the story, is a breach of narrative-grammar best explained intertextually.98 Greek myth makes Ino a Semite: her father was Phoenician,99 her husband a child-slayer like the devotees of Moloch (II Kings 23:10), in life her son's name recalls the Tyrian Melqart (cf. I Kings 18:4-13), and in death he was called lnaaX tov, ostensibly "the Wrestler," but perhaps corrupted from Phoenician Ba'al-hamon, "Lord of the Multitude." In her honour the Laconian Epidaureans threw into a pond bannock (pGlca, Paus. 3.23.8), which has a Hebrew counterpart (matstsah, Genesis 19:3, etc.).100 Ino was an aunt of Dionysus, whom Herodotus equated with Osiris (2.42.2, etc.); hence J. Fontenrose (1948: 147) guessed that she was once named *Oiv6 &lt; oivoc, "wine" (a pan-Aegean word; cf. Latin vinum, Ugaritic yn, Hebrew yayin). A tale that blends the classical clich6 of the saeva noverca101 with levantine harem-intrigue says that she faked a Delphic oracle bidding Athamas sacrifice his first-born, Phrixus (Apollod. Bibl. 1.9.1 = Parke and Wormell 1956: 2.82, no. 196 [not in Fontenrose's catalogue]; cf. Hdt. 7.197), whom Nephele spared by sending the ram that swam him to safety (Pind. Pyth. 4.161).102 This tale, too, has Biblical echoes in Sarah's envy of Ishmael (Genesis 21:10) and Abraham's barely averted sacrifice of Isaac, in which the ram is a stand-in, not a get-away vehicle (22 passim). As we have seen, the phrase "into the wine-dark sea," which here rubs shoulders with the ban on retrospection, was also Near Eastern. Thus, by not looking as he flees eternity on Ogygia at the deathless veil of one deified like Osiris by drowning, Odysseus obeys the pan-Aegean rule that only the ferry-man of the Duat/Hades and Osiris, Lord of Amenta can look back to eternity and immortality. 96Smith 1983: 71. 97 Holley 1949: 42-47. 98 Riffaterre 1978: 164-165. 99Proof of Phoenician origin for the tale that Cadmus came from Phoenicia seeking Europa is that both names are transparently Semitic with appropriate Greek endings added, namely qdm, "in front," hence "east" and 'rb, "to go down (of the sun, etc.)," hence "west." 1000n the Semitic origin of Ino, see Astour 1967: 204-212, with bibl.

WHY MENELAUS GOT TO ELYSIUM Proteus says that Menelaus owes his good fortune to no virtue of body or soul or any saving grace of the Olympians, but to being Zeus' son-in-law (Od. 4.569-570). Zeus' nepotism is a wonky affair, if the mightiest god, who could not save the son for whom he rains blood (I1. 16.431-461), can forever reprieve a non-relative, yet there is no mistake, for next to arrive in the blessed isles are Nereus' son-in-law, Peleus, and Ares' son-in-law, Cadmus (Pind. 0l. 2.68-83; Eur. Bacch. 1329-40). Sons-in-law had special standing: Menelaus himself won the Spartan throne, as Buxtehude his organist's job at Ldibeck, by marrying the incumbent's daughter, and Penelope's suitors assume that whoever wins will be not just her husband but also king of Ithaca-rightly, it seems, for no one corrects them (but cf. Od. 1.386-387). The clearest case in epic where a son succeeds his father is Oedipus, who took the Theban throne from Laius by mistake, while coincidentally marrying an heiress (Od. 11.271-280). From these and other tales, M. Finkelberg (1991: 306-307) claims, assuming on scant evidence that the queen was hereditary priestess of the local goddess, and despite the overwhelmingly patriarchal cast of heroic Greek society,103 that royal succession was regularly matrilineal. Yet two customs whereby Greeks paid back families for daughters, whose loss through marriage they felt only since the bride moved to her husband's home, refute this claim. Though in discussing marriage Homer may hint obliquely at dowries (for example, II. 1.277-278 [= 2.196-197]; 2.53-54, 132-133), he often names the bride-price (~6voa) as the way the groom won the bride (16.178, etc.); should she prove unfaithful, the cuckold could demand it back (II. 16.173-192; 22.467-472; Od. 8.313-320; 16.386-392).104 At sundry times in history, self- absorbed Greek fathers (cf. Pl. Lach. 179d-e) trusted their sons to the care of teachers (II. 16.139-144 = 19.388-391), pederasts (Aesch. fr. 228-229 TrGF; cf. P1. Symp. 180a), whose cups they bore at parties (II. 20.232-235; Hymn. Hom. Ven. 202-206; Pind. 01. 1.44-45; cf. II. 1.470; 9.175; 20.234; Od. 1.148), or in the limit-case of infant-exposure whatever kind soul might rescue them (Soph. OT 717-720; Hdt. 1.110; Eur. Ion 17-20, etc.).105 Boys were close to their mothers (for example, II. 1.359-361; Pind. 01. 1.46; Pyth. 4.186; 8.85) and surrogates were often her male kin, as Achilles left Neoptolemus with Lycomedes, and Odysseus got his scar while hunting with Autolycus and sons (II. 19.321-327; Od. 19.392-412; cf. II. 11.221-228).106 Thus the family reft of its daughter claimed, if but for a time, her son,107 so strengthening the bond that Greek girls like Althaea 103Wohl 1993. 104 Lacey 1966. 105 For education, see Robbins 1993; for pederasty, see Bremmer 1990; for exposure, see Redford 1967b. 106Bremmer 1976; 1983b. 107Duby 1978: 6 (I thank Curtis Nadj for this reference).</page><page sequence="18">230 PHOENIX and Antigone felt for their brothers, barbarian Medea being the exception that proves the rule (II. 9.565-572; Soph. Ant. 908-913; Arist. Rbet. 3.16.9; Eur. Med. 1333-35; but cf. Hdt. 3.119).108 Though rare at best in Greece, matrilineality was basic to contemporary Egyptian dogma, for to legitimize their power after the foreign disruption of the shepherd kings in the Second Intermediate Period (Manetho frs. 42, 54; cf. Hdt. 2.128),109 and in keeping with the ancient royal title s3 r', "son of Ra," Tuthmosid pharaohs claimed divine descent. Since the divine parent had to be male, for everyone knows one's mother, while fatherhood is moot (Od. 1.215-216; cf. Men. fr. 227 Koerte), they forged a myth of divine droit de seigneur, as in Heracles' tale (Hes. Scut. 27-56), whereby Amun came in pharaoh's garb to the great king's wife and begat the heir apparent, as official lives say of Hashepsowe and Amenhotep III.110 Here too there is ancient precedent in the mythic conflict of Horus with his maternal uncle Seth (P. Chester Beatty 1, recto), which to some suggests matrilineal descent."11 (It was once thought that the title m.t-ntr imn, "priestess [lit. god's wife] of Amun," borne throughout the dynasty by the main queen, also implies this role, but Egyptologists have now disproven this.)112 As a practical outcome, the bloodline passed from queen to daughter, pharaoh ostensibly standing in for his heir's true father, Amun. This actually happened with the dynasty's first queen, Ahmose Nofretary, first to be called "god's wife of Amun" (cf. the "Donation" stela from Amun's temple at Karnak).113 She was her husband's sister, as a vase from Sinai proves,114 and Egyptologists assume for want of counter-evidence that she also bore both his successor, Amenhotep I, and his principal wife, Meritamun. By the dynasty's end Tut'ankhamin's widow could still ask Hittite king Suppiluliuma to marry her to one of his sons, who would be the new pharaoh (KUB A iii 1-24),115 and the queen's status is shown by Tuvratta of Mitanni, who, when ill-used by Amenhotep Iv, grieved not to him but to Queen-Mother Teye (EA 26).116 Egyptians perhaps tried to blend this matrilineal tendency with their own patriarchy by strict endogamy, for pharaoh often took his sister as first wife. Alternatively, as G. Robins (1983) has argued, pharaohs may have wed their sisters to mimic the gods, emphasizing their divinity and distancing themselves from commoners, who eschewed the practice,117 in 108Golden 1990: 121-135. 109 On legitimation of power, see Otto 1969; Baines 1995. 110Hashepsowe: Breasted 1906: 2.80; Amenhotep III: Campbell 1912: 25. The Egyptian myth perhaps influenced the Greek: see Burkert 1965: 167-169. 111 Khler 1972: 19; Leach 1976: 2.

Either way, it keeps power all in the family lest the king be beholden to his wife's kin (cf. Hdt. 3.53.3),118 and however the causality worked, the two customs were inextricably linked. Greeks knew of royal Egyptian incest and it made them sick (Aesch. Suppl. 387-396, 931-932),119 though the Ptolemies would later follow suit. It follows that they also knew cases of Egyptian matrilineal descent. These facts bear on Menelaus. Zeus came to rule by overthrowing Cronus, who had himself deposed Uranus, like Teshub in the Anush-Kumarbi-Teshub line of Hittite myth. Fearing a son still unborn who might oust him in turn, Zeus swallowed Metis when she was bearing what would prove to be his loyal daughter, Athena (Hes. Theog. 886-900), and, in a deliberate ploy to shift strife from heaven to earth,120 wed Thetis to Peleus when he learned that she should bear a son greater than his father (Pind. Isth. 8.26-36; ps.-Aesch. PV 907-927), a myth alluded to in the Iliad (1.404).121 One could say that, as Thetis' and Peleus' child, the Iliadic hero was living proof of Zeus' succession-Angst. In a small pantheon short on nubile goddesses,122 both Cronus and Zeus were born of incest, so their succession was patriarchal and matrilineal at once. On this pattern, Zeus' drastic attempts not to beget a rival would fail unless he dealt with Helen's husband, the more so since she was worshipped, perhaps as a moon-god ('Eeivil &lt; ? oaiivirl), at.Therapne near Sparta (Hdt. 6.61).123 So he hatched a plan (the At1b ... pouki of II. 1.5; Cypria fr. 1.7 Davies, Bernab6) to part Helen and Menelaus after Hermione's birth but before they could have a son.124 For all its cost in human lives, the project failed when Helen rejoined Menelaus after the war, and a new strategy was called for. Elysium has perfect weather (Od. 4.561-570) and, like Ogygia, is a make- believe, "holodeck" form of Olympus (cf. 6.41-46; Lucr. 3.18-22). By sending Menelaus there in perpetual, if anodyne exile from the real McCoy, no less than by swallowing Metis and marrying Thetis off below her station, Zeus may have seen himself as forestalling a palace-coup. IV. POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS The simplest would be pure chance. Many aspects of the Odyssey's Elysium are echoed piecemeal in diverse Indo-european sources: we meet the plain in Yama's otherworldly cowpasture (geavyuiti/, 4Rgveda 10.14.2) and the meadow 1181 thank Gregory Nagy for this reference; cf. Robins 1999: 172. 119MacKinnon 1978: 78. 120 Arthur 1982: 77; Mayer 1996. 121 Slatkin 1991: 53-82. 122 West 1966: 37. There were at any given time only twelve Olympians (Pind. OL. 5.5, 10.49; etc.). An altar to them stood in the Athenian agora; see Travlos 1971: 458-461, with bibl. 123 Zeus' other divine daughters are virgins. Heracles is no threat to Zeus, since he owes his presence on Olympus to Zeus-given apotheosis. The other inhabitant of Elysium named in the Odyssey, Rhadamanthys, is Zeus' son by Europa. 124Kullmann 1956.</page><page sequence="20">232 PHOENIX mentioned in Hittite death-rituals (wellu, KUB XXX 24 II.1-4).125 The magic Phaeacianesque ferry-men we find in Welcker's men of Brittia, noted above (222), and in Harbard/O6inn's ferrying in Harbards-liod.126 From these scattered sources we might conclude that Indo-europeans thought the afterlife polarized between a dank and fusty Hell and a paradisiacal meadow reached by night on ships of supernatural speed with a special crew who row rather than sail, and that the Odyssey's Elysium is a vestige of that belief. There are problems, such as that the ferry-men imply that Indo-europeans, like Hesiod (Op. 171; cf. Pind. 01. 2.70-71), thought paradise an island, while the Odyssey speaks rather of a plain (4.561-569). More tellingly, though, we can recover nothing in Indo-european lore that remotely equals the clear parallel between Egyptian sbt i3rw, "field of reeds," m3'Yrw, "justified of voice" (the commonest name for its inhabitants), and *r(w)d-imntt, "man of the West" (i.e., Osiris, its divine judge) on the one hand and Greek Elysian plain, pd`KapC, and Rhadamanthys on the other. If Greeks indeed borrowed Elysium from Egypt, the obvious date at which this occurred would be the orientalizing seventh century, when they adopted the alphabet and fixed the Odyssey in its final form, for the Odyssey-poet(s) were clearly interested in Thebes (4.126-127) and the Nile (14.257-265; 17.423-424), which Diodorus Siculus takes as proof of autopsy (1.12.9-10). There are, however, two reasons to think that Elysium in Greek long predates this period. First is that the idea entered epic language deeply enough to produce its own semic system, for as I have suggested above it figures as a sky-river, sails like wings, Odysseus' eternity-spurning glance, and special status for Menelaus, as well as in 'HXU6otov tCE6fov itself. Second is that the bards have highly adapted this last term. We might have expected sht i3rw to appear in Greek as either *sekha(n) 'HXaoof(v) or *6ovCCdKv Cne6ov. For both loan-word and calque first to arise and then contaminate one another must have taken much time. One might think that a longstanding term would have wider currency than Elysium, a hapax in the Odyssey, which does not recur until Apollonius (4.811), yet there is a narrative reason for its rarity since Menelaus is its only denizen linked to the War, Peleus and Cadmus never having gone to Troy. There is also an extrinsic reason, as we shall see. There is one much earlier period at which Egyptian influence on Greek is possible, namely the thirteenth century, the era both of the fall of Troy VIIa that gave the bards their central theme and of the Egyptian cultural zenith of the eighteenth dynasty. Archaeology proves pan-Aegean contact at the time,127 and philologists now grant that trade in goods implies exchange of vocabulary and 125 Puhvel 1969 = 1981: 210-215; Lincoln 1977. 126 Vigfiisson and Powell 1883: 1.117-123; cf. Lincoln 1980: 46-47. 127 Cline 1994, with bibl.; Morris 1997: 602-603, seeing Egyptian influence as scant compared with Semitic. The late-Helladic shipwreck found off Ulu Burun near Kay, Turkey in 1984 gives direct evidence of this pan-Aegean culture: see Bass 1987; Payton 1991.</page><page sequence="21">SAILING TO ELYSIUM 233 myth.128 This is most true when an artifact involves certain ideas. For example, carbonate of soda (NA2CO3), which Egyptians arguably shipped to Greece with baking soda, salt, and alum to aid in saving fish (cf. Hes. ap. Ath. 116b; Soph. fr. 712 TrGF; Tobit 6.5),129 entailed the embalming for which they also used it, which introduced the rich religious beliefs whose ritual expression it was (cf. Hdt. 2.50).130 Moreover, some Bronze Age words survive in the Odyssey,131 though often just vestiges of obsolete things that the bards themselves had forgotten-as we still issue "curfews" (&lt; French couvrefeu) while having no hearth to put out-, which hardly rescue its portrait of that time from errors, of which the list is long.132 Formular in nature, the Odyssey was an oral poem133 in constant flux until written down. This was after Greeks began to write, of course134-probably not long, though clues are vexingly scant,135 for comparison with other oral cultures and the witness of Greek vase-painting tell against the alternate, anti- evolutionary view, urged by G. S. Kirk (1985: 1.1-16), that oral bards reproduced a monumental text for centuries before anyone transcribed it. This state of flux was cleansing, as I. Morris (1986: 87) has stressed, though this did not apply to formulae fixed in the epic word-hoard like 6ttnrc~r o; oraCootoo, which on a strict Parryist (1971: 128) reading means no more than "the only kind [of river] that there was in the heroic age." A Greek audience in the centuries before 650 had scant interest in Egyptian eschatology. Still, they cared about Elysium as the charter for a world they themselves hoped to enter after death. No mere velleity, this hope they enshrined in the act of initiation in mysteries like Demeter's at Eleusis, whose non-Greek component is proved by the intractable name 128Esp. Bernal 1987-91; Duhoux 1988; West 1988; 1997; Burkert 1992. These scholars' views were to some degree anticipated by Bogan 1658; Lauth 1867; Parker 1917. 129Curtis 1991. The oxyrhynchus-fish hieroglyph (K4 on the sign-list) is the determinative in the word h3.t, "corpse" (Bidoli 1976: 51); w'bt means both "place of embalming" and "kitchen." Empedocles was once incarnated as a fish (31 B 117 Diels-Kranz). 1301 argue (1994: 20-23) that vkKrTp &lt; Egyptian ntry, "carbonate of soda." However, rival etymologies from within Indo-european abound: see Nagy 1990: 139. 131Ruijgh 1957; West 1988: 156-159. 132 Finley 1965: 39; Raaflaub 1998. 133 Parry 1930: 134-137 = 1971: 7; 1932 = 1971: 325-364.

In general, see Carpenter 1933 and 1938; Powell 1991. 135The Iliad and Odyssey might have been finished by the first quotations, like the late eighth- century (Metzger 1965) inscription on "Nestor's cup" (fr. 454 Hansen), which may allude to II. 11.632-637 (but see West 1995: 205), and Simonides (obit 468; cf.

Sic. 1.29, 96; Lactant. Inst. Div. 1.21). The mysteries promised a blessed existence after death (Pind. fr. 137a Maehler; Soph. fr. 837 TrGF; Isocr. 4.28), arguably in Elysium136 and their KUKWOV (Hymn. Hornm. Dem. 206-211), if narcotic,137 recalls the Egyptian vryiwev0; (Od. 4.220-232). Tellingly this cult, though begun in Erechtheus' time (Marmor Parium 239 A 14 FGrH), peaked round 650, with the Telesterion and peribolos being greatly expanded under Peisistratus,138 who had a tyrant's fondness for mystery cults, in a place whose name, Burkert (1961: 209) notes, recalls Elysium. This is relevant to Proteus' prophecy for whoever, like Cook (1995), thinks that the Odyssey reached its final form in Athens as a celebration of Athena's triumph over Poseidon (Hdt. 8.55) and of democratic rhetoric over aristocratic rule by force, for in their heyday it was Athens' archon basileus who oversaw the Mysteries. (If Elysium recalls them, the less said of it the better, as Aeschylus [test. 93-94 TrGF] and Alcibiades [Lys. 6; Andoc. On the Mysteries; Plut. Alc. 19] could aver, which may be another reason why few authors use the word.) The Ino-episode contains neither loan-words nor calques, but its mythemes too recall the Demeter-cult: the girl who paradoxically survives drowning, the goddess with the vinous name of (O)ino, and a ban on looking back at immortality all recall the girl who flees Hades, the grain-goddess Doso (Hymn. Hornm. Dem. 122, Passow's emend.), and the order for initiates (pG6oat) to keep their eyes shut (pG6tv) until they beheld the ecstatic vision of the itnoncreia. To conclude, we have seen that the river, ship, and ferry-man whom dead Egyptians met on their way to the Reed-Field left their mark on the Odyssey and that Menelaus comes thither thanks to Zeus' anxiety over a specifically matrilineal succession better attested in Tuthmosid Egypt than in Greece itself. We have also seen that there is a reason, quite unlike those that let bards adopt these ideas, that kept them alive into the seventh century. These facts make it yet more likely that the nub of Egyptian funerary myth, the Field of Reeds, appears therein as Elysium. APPENDIX The argument that follows supplements and supports my earlier (1997a) claim that epic bards knew of the most signal fact of Egyptian geography, the annual Nile flood.139 Thales (11 A 16 Diels-Kranz), Hecataeus (1 F 302 FGrH), and Herodotus (2.19-27) know of it, which perhaps explains why the latter thinks Egypt the gift of the river (2.5). Strabo says that Homer knows it too (yvthptiov iv zb ad90o4 to or 7cqao6 i t O ot1rj, 1.2.30 [C 37]), and some scholars try to show from the epics that he is right. R. Carpenter (1946: 176, n. t) and G. S. 136Guthrie 1935: 155-156; Mylonas 1961: 283. 137Wasson and Hofmann 1978; pace Burkert 1987: 108-109. 138Mylonas 1961: 77-105. 139Janssen 1987: 129, nn. 1-2, with bibl.</page><page sequence="23">SAILING TO ELYSIUM 235 Kirk, J. E. Raven, and M. Schofield (1983: 12) suggest that bards identified the river Ocean with the Nile and used the epithet &amp;cy6ppoo;, "back-flowing" (II. 18.399; Od. 20.65) not to describe the river as "encircling the earth andflowing back into itself' (LSJ s.v.), but rather in its annual flooding of the Delta and subsequent return within its banks. Yet the bards seem to have thought Ocean the Nile's source, and not the Nile itself (II. 21.194-197; Hes. Theog. 337-338). D. Bonneau (1964: 196-199), encouraged by P. Gilbert's (1939) support for Diodorus Siculus' claim that the Odyssey-poet knew Egypt first-hand, argues that the formula 8ttincsto; 7romgozto (used of the Nile at Od. 4.477, 581), which he renders as "venu des pluies" or "venu de Zeus," implies that the bards knew why the flood occurred. Yet, as we said above, such a translation is suspect. A better case can be made. P. V. Ernsted (1954), discussing Od. 14.257-258 (rTcprtCailot 6' A'lYUrtov iUppEiZrrV i6LEcaocc, / orija*o 6' ev Aiy6rtOr 7roztpcop viaC, &amp;Cteooag), argues against the usual view whereby both occurrences of AYyIurtoc in these lines refer to the Nile. Noting such close repetition of the same noun, rather than the use of a pronoun in the second place, and the fact that tnorag;6c occurs in apposition to the noun in its second rather than its first occurrence,140 he suggests that in its first use, AYyvurxo refers to the land of Egypt (as is certain a dozen lines earlier at 246) and to the Nile only in the second. He offers a parallel at 17.425-427 (6;, [Zc6;,] jg' xa XJlaiTripot ro7 urdXyKtlrototv VCrKCv/ ACYyur6v6' [i.e., "to Egypt"] t at 6okXtilv 656v ' 64p' 0 &amp;oooilv. / aoijoa 6' v Aiy'6nxtp itot~io [i.e., "the Nile"] via, &amp;a?tioLtcaac). It follows that the adjective h0ppcs{rlc in 14.257 cannot, pace LSJ s.v., mean "fair-flowing," as in its one other Homeric occurrence (II. 6.34), where it modifies the river- name, Satnioeis-for this would be nonsense as a description of a country. Ernsted, however, pointing out that the verb i5~co, source of the second element of C6ppitg, means not only "to flow" but also "to be flowed over (by)," as in the formula i~c 6' ai'tart yaia (II. 8.65 etc.), suggests that Od. 14.257 treats Cbppt~zrl, as derived from Pew in this other sense, and translates as "abundantly watered" (o6HJIbHO opoUlaeMbIH'). Though pure linguistics, Ernsted's remarks have a historical point, for Egypt was "abundantly watered" only in being flooded yearly by the Nile. That bards used this word, so construed, of the river "Egypt" suggests more clearly than &amp;x6ppoo; or 8ttnCEig that they knew of the flood long before Thales, Hecataeus, and Herodotus reported it.
