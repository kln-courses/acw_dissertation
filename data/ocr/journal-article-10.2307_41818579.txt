<plain_text><page sequence="1">Music in Art XXXIV/ 1-2 (2009) Anthropomorphic Terror: The Bête-Machine , the Ballet de Cour, and the Tragédie en Musique Desmond Hosford City University of New York, The Graduate Center When René Descartes (1596-1650) and his followers beat living dogs, nailed them to boards by the paws, and cut them open to examine their working hearts and circulating blood,1 the ability to ignore the animals' cries was grounded in Descartes' s claim in the Discours de la méthode (1637) that the actions of animals are mere reflexes of "nature that works within them according to the disposition of their organs, just as one sees a clock, which is made up only of wheels and springs, count the hours'7.2 This well-known notion of the "bête-machine" (animal-machine) has bolstered the view that in early modern France, animals were regarded as soulless creatures intended by God for human use, entertainment, and consumption. However, the writings of Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592), among others, coupled with a large corpus of anthropomor- phic literature, dramatic performances, and visual art, reveal that the anthropocentrism of seventeenth- century France was neither wholly Cartesian nor concretely established. Instead there was discomfort over the possible distinctions between human and non-human animals and their relative status. This anxiety was manifested in the ballet de cour and the tragédie en musique where the bête-machine served as a site of anthropo- morphic transformation that projected the uneasy anthropocentrism of early modern France. Early modern European views on non-human animals were grounded in two traditions: the Judeo- Christian, which constructed a biblical approbation for the exploitation and slaughter of animals, and clas- sical philosophy. In Plato's teleology, all of nature is animated by a world soul, and Aristotle stratifies this soul on three levels: plants, animals, and humans, a hierarchy that supposedly justifies the human exploita- tion of animals since, although animals have some anthropomorphic characteristics, only humans, according to Aristotle, have reason and the capacity for speech. This approach constitutes the imperative of difference, stressing that human and non-human animals differ in kind. Pythagoras, on the other hand, developed the theory of metempsychosis, the transmigration of souls, which required vegetarianism, Diogenes refused to eat or wear animals, and Porphyry, also a believer in metempsychosis, explained that non-human animals can speak, although people cannot understand them, so they are indeed rational, a position defended by Plu- tarch.3 This second strain of classical thought, known as theriophily, constitutes the imperative of similarity. In early modern France, one of the foremost representatives of the theriophilic tradition was Montaigne, and he, following Porphyry, insisted on the imperative of similarity: It is by the vanity of this very imagination that man equals himself to God . . . that he selects and separates himself from the throng of other creatures, cuts portions for the animals, his brethren and companions, and distributes to them whatever portion of faculties and abilities that he sees fit.4 Montaigne further asserts a demand for similarity by insisting that: This fault that hinders communication between them and us, why is it not equally ours as theirs? . . . It is no great wonder if we do not understand them, and neither do we understand Basques and Troglodytes.5 © 2009 Research Center for Music Iconography CUNY 21</page><page sequence="2">Desmond Hosford, The Bête-Machine, the Ballet de Cour, and the Tragédie en Musique 1. Charles Le Brun, Three eagles7 heads and three men's heads engraved by André Le Grand for Louis-Marie-Joseph Morel d'Arleux's Dissertation sur un traité de Charles Le Brun concernant le rapport de la physionomie humaine avec celle des animaux (Paris: Musée Napoléon, 1806). In other words, human reason does not necessarily permit the understanding of all languages, and animals cannot be blamed for "this fault that hinders communication" any more than a Frenchman can claim dominion over other nations or races based on linguistic difference. This assertion debunks speciesism, which places all of creation at the disposition of humans, to the level of racism, establishing an equality in which Montaigne asserts that "there is a certain respect that attaches us . . . we owe . . . benevolence to other creatures . . . There is some relationship between them and us, and some mutual obligation."6 By defying speciesism, the imperative of similarity establishes striking parallels between human and non- human animals, revealing that seventeenth-century French culture was not wholly characterized by Cartesian anthropocentrism. A large corpus of literature in all genres, from the Satires of Nicolas Boileau (1636-1711), to the Fables of Jean de La Fontaine (1621-1695), is characterized by anthropomorphism and theriophily. In La Fontaine's "La chatte métamorphosée en femme" ( Fables II, 1678), a woman retains her feline habits, including chasing mice, and in Marie-Catherine Le Jumel de Barneville d'Aulnoy's (1650-1795) "La chatte blanche" ( Contes nouveaux ou Les fées à la mode, 1698), a prince falls in love with a cat possessing all human characteristics and who is later revealed to be a princess under a spell. These works are emblematic of anthropomorphic fluidity and reveal the proximity of human and non-human animals in the popular imagination of seventeenth-century France. As Michel Foucault explains of animals, "one may describe certain rather complex forms beginning with their very visible resemblance to the human body, which serves as a reference for models of visibility."7 Nowhere is this link between corporeal structures more evident than in a series of studies made by Charles Le Brun (1619-1690) for his Traité du rapport de la figure humaine avec celle des animaux (1671) in which he explores the physical similarities between men and non-human animals [fig. 22</page><page sequence="3">Music in Art XXXIV/ 1-2 (2009) 1] .8 According to seventeenth-century theories of physiognomy, character traits and the passions were revealed on the surface of the body through physical constitution and gesture. Some of these elements, such as bearing and expression, could be constructed through studied artifice, which was the basis of the notion of honnêteté* and the corporeal codes that grounded early modern French acting techniques and academic visual art.10 Other elements marked an individual's character at birth, were always dominant, and could only be overcome with concerted effort.11 Characteristics allegedly proper to certain non-human animals were also supposed to distinguish people who shared their physical traits. Le Brun' s annotations to his sketches assert that the monkey, for example, is signaled by "esprit" (intelligence), the donkey is "opiniâtre" (stubborn), and cats are purportedly "opiniâtre, méfiant; opiniâtre, farouche; opiniâtre et craintif" (stubborn, mistrustful; stubborn, fierce; stubborn, and fearful). As Keith Tester observes, "animals are useful for humans to be able to think human",12 which is what Le Brun is doing in his anthropomorphic or reverse anthropocentric studies, emphasizing that there is something animal about humans, and, conversely, something human about animals. Anthropomorphism played a central role in the ballet de cour and the tragédie en musique through its implication in the merveilleux, which hinges on the acceptance of a verisimilitude governed only by the requirements of the libretto. Almost twenty years before Le Brun' s physiognomy treatise, a man with an owl's head and wings (the "grand Homme") had appeared commanding a troupe of demons and summon- ing the sorcerers in the septième entrée of the troisième partie of the Ballet de la nuit (1653) with a libretto by Isaac de Benserade (1613-1691). The owl, with its nocturnal associations, evokes sorcery and the superna- tural,13 and the fear invoked by species proximity in the grand Homme is revealed in the verses that accompany the loup-garous (werewolves),14 of which there are six in the dixième entrée of the troisième partie of the same ballet:15 Demy Bergers &amp; demy Loups Nous sommes aux trouppeaux effroyables &amp; doux Qui ne nous sçavent recoignoistre, Et de Fair que nous nous changeons D'un costé nous les menons paistre, Et de l'autre nous les mangeons.16 Half Shepherds &amp; half Wolves We are frightful and sweet to the flocks Who do not know how to recognize us; And with the appearances that we change On one side we lead them to graze, And on the other we eat them. The loup-garous , along with the grand Homme, incarnate the imperative of similarity and bring to the fore the early modern anxiety over the unpredictability and ethical distress caused by such an imperative. "Demy Bergers &amp; demy Loups", the loup-garous are "effroyables &amp; doux", neither human nor non-human, raising a conflict between whether they, as men, have souls and are subject to reason, whether they correspond to the Cartesian assertion that non-human animals are irrational, and whether, as in La Fontaine's "Le loup et l'agneau" ( Fables 1, 1668), 17 "The wolf carries him off and eats him, / Without any other form of appeal". The plausibility that one might be eaten by a loup-garou was allegedly real in seventeenth-century France, and there are a number of cases in which people were condemned to death for purportedly being werewolves, some of which are recorded in works such as the Discours exécrable des sorciers by Henry Boguet (1550 -1619), Grand Juge au Comté de Bourgogne, which was first published in Lyons in 1602. Boguet's tract contains detailed information about werewolves in general and reports of individual werewolves and their alleged crimes, including "many children killed &amp; eaten by werewolves" and "with what instruments they murder people".18 Ultimately, the uneasiness over what is a human and what is a non-human animal hinges on the worry about whether one will eat or be eaten. Blurred demarcations between what is distinguished as properly human and non-human are typical of the demons belonging to the suite of the enchantress Armide in the Ballet de la délivrance de Renaud (1617). In the troisième entrée,19 after Armide' s palace has been destroyed: Spite makes her summon her Demons by all new conjurations . . . Three in the form of a crayfish, two as tortoises, and two as snails . . . come forth from under dark caves . . . the Demons emerge from their shells and appear in the form of old women.20 These demons are doubly deceptive in appearing either as animals or as humans, revealing, as do the grand Homme and the loup-garou in the Ballet de la nuit, the dangerous instability involved in species differentiation, particularly in a supernatural context. The Ballet de la délivrance de Renaud includes other performative 23</page><page sequence="4">Desmond Hosford, The Bête-Machine, the Ballet de Cour, and the Tragédie en Musique 2. Ambroise Paré, " Figure of a monster half man &amp; half pig", Livre des monstres &amp; prodiges (Paris: Chez Gabriel Buon, 1675). corporeal manifestations of frightening liminality arising from an apparent disjunction in the natural order. In the première entrée, 21 Renaud and his knights encounter monsters under the command of Armide: Immediately appeared six different Monsters . . . two of which had the head, the wings, and the feet of owls with the rest of the body covered with the gown of a jurist . . two others had the head, the arms, and the legs of a dog, the rest of the body resembling a peasant, and the two last having the head, arms, and legs of a monkey, were in the guise of a chambermaid, young and dressed according to the current fashion. These monsters . . . attacked the two knights . . . and they resisted them with 22 arms. These monsters are similar to the grand Homme (the first even have "the head, the wings, and the feet of owls'7) and the loup-garous of the Ballet de la nuit in that they are outwardly neither entirely human, nor entirely non-human. On the one hand, they might be considered demons, particularly since they are under the spell of a pagan enchantress (the plot of the Ballet de la délivrence de Renaud is grounded in the triumph of the Christian knight), and Armide's forces are almost always designated "démons". In this context they are frightening in their association with Satan and witchcraft, one that weighed heavily in seventeenth- century France where the threat of demons was perceived as real. Among the most spectacular, even theatrical, incidents of demonic possession took place at Loudun in 1632-33 where the Ursuline nuns were allegedly possessed by demons, provoking public exorcisms followed by the torture and burning at the stake of the priest Urbain Grandier (1590-1634). 22 Even more notorious was the Affaire des Poisons (ca. 1675-1682), which involved burnings at the stake of alleged witches such as Marie-Madeleine-Marguerite d'Aubray, marquise de Brinvilliers (1630-1676) and Catherine Monvoisin, known as La Voisin (1640-1680), and the incrimination of some of the foremost personages at court, including Françoise- Athénaïs de Rochechouart de Mortemart, marquise de Montespan (1641-1707), mistress of Louis XIV, in scandalous cases involving Satanic worship, unholy love philters, and poison.24 Armide's demonic suite of monsters and the confusion over their species designation had frightening reverberations with spectators because it was based on the theoretical existence of demons, which many considered to be concrete, as evidenced by cases such as the possessions at Loudun, the Affaire des Poisons, and the support of medical science. In 1573, Ambroise Paré (ca. 1509-1590), surgeon to Henri II, François II, Charles IX, and Henri III, published his Livre des monstres &amp; prodiges,25 which describes and illustrates allegedly true and documented cases of monstrous liminal creatures very similar to the demons in the première entrée of the Ballet de la 24</page><page sequence="5">Music in Art XXXIV/ 1-2 (2009) délivrance de Renaud. These include a half-dog, half-human child allegedly seen by the pope, a "pig having the head, feet, &amp; hands of a man, &amp; the rest of a pig",26 and a "monster half man &amp; half pig"27 [fig. 2]. The alleged existence of creatures that could not be accurately classified as either human or non-human fueled the anthropomorphic uneasiness performatively corporealized in the ballet de cour, which also called upon deceptive aspects of species identification. Beyond being frequently questionable in cases of creatures that were apparently part human and part non-human, species distinction in early modern Europe could also be problematic in situations where the entity in question was, for all practical purposes, apparently human. In La primavera trionfante dell'inverno (To- rino, 1657), there is a dance for pygmies and cranes,28 in which, "cranes battled with Pygmies, and cranes danced in the air and carried off the Pygmies by the means of some machines.29 Although these cranes do not evoke the same supernatural fright as the grand Homme, the loup-garous, or the demons and monsters that appear to be half-human and half-non-human, they apparently triumph over what, according to modern notions of humanity, are evidently human beings, something that, in light of the early modern anthropocen- tric construction of human dominion over non-humans, would expectedly be disturbing as a reversal of the "natural" order. Carnavalesque inversion, including images of the "monde renversé" (upside-down world) in which human animals are forced to do hard labor, used for sport, hunted and killed, butchered, and roasted by non-human animals, reflected a discomfort over the moral and ethical equity of the relative position of human and non-human animals that was ordinarily concealed by the veneer of daily life. The periodic surfacing of such worry functioned to relieve distress within acceptable culturally prescribed boun- daries such as Carnival and theatrical performance.30 Against this background, the cranes' victory over the Pygmées in La primavera trionfante is not disturbing, but reassuring, because Pygmies in early modern France were not considered properly human. Rather, because they were outside the usual order of nature, they were considered a type of monster. According to Paré "Monsters are things that appear against the course of nature (&amp; are most often the sign of some misfortune to come)".31 This assertion is confirmed by the appearance the "Monstres nains" (Monster dwarves) who arrive after the grand Homme and before the loup- garous in the septième entrée of the troisième partie of the Ballet de la nuit. The dwarves "emerge from four Snail Shells, &amp; are lifted into the air",32 and this in itself marks them as "contre la cours de la nature" and non- human. Humans, or at least the apparently human, cannot naturally emerge from snail shells, so these dwarves are just as unnatural as the demons in the Ballet de la délivrance de Renaud, which also "emerge from their shells". The verses for the Monstres nains affirm their unnatural quality: Nostre difformité nous fait assez paroistre, Mais rien de si petit ne se voit sous les Cieux; Quand on est Monstre aussi le moindre qu'on puisse estre N'est-ce me semble que le mieux.33 Our deformity makes us appear enough so, But nothing so small is seen under the Heavens; When one is a Monster also the smaller that one may be Seems to me only the best. The "difformité" of these dwarves is what corporeally marks them as monsters, a status in which they revel, "Quand on est Monstre aussi le moindre qu'on puisse estre / N'est-ce me semble que le mieux." In the Ballet de la nuit, the dwarves are "lifted into the air" just as in La primavera trionfante dell'inverno they are carried off by the cranes in a battle that they were predestined to lose, since monsters "are most often the sign of some misfortune to come". The scene of the pygmies and the cranes could therefore be interpreted as comic, since, unlike with the threat of the loup-garou, no human lives were at stake, the plight of Pygmées being of little worry since they, as monsters, were just as well eliminated along with the disorder and disturbance of nature that they substantiate. Although the grand Homme, the loup-garous, and the Pygmées exhibit characteristically human features, other typical inhabitants of the ballet de cour and the tragédie en musique do not, and they appear with great frequency. In the Ballet des fées de la forêt de Saint-Germain (1625), the train of the fairy Alizon la Hargneuse is carried by a dragon, that of Perrette la Hasardeuse by a cat, and there is a dance for valets and monkeys playing tourniquet. 34 La finta pazza (1645) includes a ballet for eunuchs, bears, and monkeys, one for ostriches, and another for Indians trying to capture parrots. These ballets are among many that stage non-human animals appearing in situations where they are obedient to or defeated by humans, situations apparently 25</page><page sequence="6">Desmond Hosford, The Bête-Machine, the Ballet de Cour, and the Tragédie en Musique 3. H. de Baussen, The fall of Phaeton, from act V of Lully and Quinaulťs Phaëton (2nd ed., Paris, 1709). ensured by the fact that these creatures were really humans in disguise. Such is also usually the case in the tragédie en musique, which, from its inception with Lully and Quinaulťs Cadmus et Hermione (1673), was crowded with fantastic animal-machines operated by men hidden within. In one sketch for a monster- machine, a man sits inside the creature, which is supported by a platform on wheels. The man's front legs hang uncovered in stirrups below the platform and out of the audience's view, his arms operate the monster's front legs, and a mechanism attached to his brow through the creature's neck moves its head.35 This machine, as many others, had a double effect. From the audience's perspective, the monster apparently moving on stage could have a frightening resonance by referencing the supernatural, and from the stage per- spective, where its non-human body and human legs were visible, it might recall the allegedly real monsters described by Paré. As such, the animal-machines of the tragédie en musique were sites of anthropomorphic transformation, clouding species distinction. 26</page><page sequence="7">Music in Art XXXIV/ 1-2 (2009) Animal-machines on the early modern French stage, such as the dragons that lifted the enchantress Armide36 and the sorceress Médée,37 and the horses that drew the chariot of Phaeton through the heavens in act V of Lully and Quinaulťs Phaëton (1683), were completely mechanical. As such, they were true bêtes- machines and were carefully constructed to deploy the merveilleux. According to the instructions for the ope- ration of Phaeton's chariot, Jupiter would appear in the heavens, lightening would shatter the chariot, and the performer, precariously attached to a wire, would, by detaching a cord with his foot, cause the chariot, the horses, and himself to tumble from the sky into the sea [fig. 3].38 In theory, the machinery, constructed by human reason as a glorious deception, had the advantage over living bête-machines of being completely known to those who constructed and worked them. However, such complex machinery was notorious for malfunctioning, prompting La Fontaine's criticism: Quand j'entends le sifflet, je ne trouve jamais Le changement si prompt que je me le promets. Souvent au plus beau char le contre-poids résiste; Un dieu pend à la corde, et crie au machiniste39 When I hear the whistle, I never find The change so quick as I expect. Often on the most handsome chariot the counterweight resists; A god hangs from a cord and yells at the machinist. Even the "plus beau char" and the god that "pend à la corde" were subject to the workings of the "contre-poids" and the "machiniste", both of which might prove faulty. Ironically, and despite the Cartesian arrogance by which such animal-machines should have been easily controlled, they, and the real animals that were sometimes forced to operate them, often resisted and sometimes injured their so-called masters.40 The resistance of the Cartesian bête-machine to complete control by humans results from the frequently ignored truth that they have their own interests, which are usually violated by human caprice, and are not, despites the claims of Descartes, simply subjects for human exploitation. The Cartesian failure to recognize this fact could easily prove fatal. Phaeton's spectacular fall, for example, in which the singer, chariot, and imitation horses would fall from the sky into the sea was a dangerous performance, the success of which depended on the functioning of machinery that, similar to living bête-machines, was never entirely predictable.41 In the early modern popular understanding of porous species boundaries, the bête-machine was dange- rous and engaged the spectator's anxiety over the distinctions allegedly separating humans, animals, mon- sters, and machines. Although sophisticated enough to be aware that theater was not reality, early modern France was also, as evidenced by the prevalence of the imperative for similarity, sensitive enough to be an- xious about performative anthropomorphism and fearful of unethical anthropocentrism. This informs the interpretation of seventeenth-century French prescriptions concerning meat. According to the anonymous Vart de bien traiter (1674), "delicacy comprises the fine exquisite manner of preparing meats" .42 One's manner of approaching meat was an indicator of sociability, "délicatesse", and, according to comportment treatises including the Nouveau traité de la civilité by Antoine de Courtin (1622-1685) touching meat with the hands was forbidden,43 from the moment of the kill, when, at least in the hunt, hounds and servants were employed, to carving and eating, which must be accomplished solely with knives and forks. Beyond the prescription not to touch meat, the act of carving is significant. Norbert Elias observes that somewhat abruptly during the seventeenth century in France, the practice of carving entire animals at noble tables ceased, and reminders that the meat dish has something to do with the killing of an animal are avoided to the utmost. . . the animal form is so concealed and changed by the art of its preparation that while eating one is scarcely reminded of its origin . . . the curve running from the carving of a large part of the animal or even the whole animal at table, through the advance in the threshold of repugnance at the sight of dead animals, to the removal of carving to specialized enclaves behind the scenes is a typical civilization curve.44 This rather sudden change in behavior in which "reminders that the meat dish has something to do with the killing of an animal are avoided to the utmost" reflects nervousness over species differentiation. In this context, squeamishness over the carving of recognizable dead animals is logical, it is understandable that there is an "advance in the threshold of repugnance at the sight of dead animals" that requires "the removal of carving to specialized enclaves", and this partly explains why the complexities of seventeenth-century French culinary art is largely devoted to disguising animal corpses. What Elias designates a "typical civili- zation curve" fits the patterns observed by Claude Lévi-Strauss who, from an anthropological perspective, demonstrates that the cooked is a hallmark of civilization.45 Special care must be taken to disguise the flesh 27</page><page sequence="8">Desmond Hosford, The Bête-Machine, the Ballet de Cour, and the Tragédie en Musique of non-human animals because it is too similar to that of the human animals that consume it. Eating one's own kind would be uncivilized and frightful, cannibalistic, recalling the loup-garous that were allegedly responsible for "many children killed &amp; eaten". Theatrical evidence supports this assertion. If humans could eat non-human animals, so too could non-humans eat people. Usually, as in Lully and Quinaulťs Persée (1682), humans, such as Andromède in danger of being devoured by a sea monster, are rescued, but this is not always the case. In Salierťs Les Danaïdes, which premiered in 1783, the stage directions for the final scene indicate that "Tartarus is seen flowing with waves of blood, and, in the middle of the stage, Danaus appears chained to a rock, his bloody entrails are devoured by a vulture."46 The audience at the Académie Royale de Musique certainly understood that the "bloody entrails" being "devoured by a vulture" were imaginary, but spectators were, nonetheless, repulsed: "At the first performance, they had created a great vulture that ate his heart, but this meal, I know not why, did not appeal to the public, and it was not served a second time."47 In light of the anthropomorphic anxiety of early modern France compounded with the strategies of anthropomorphic terror characteristically engaged by the ballet de cour and the tragédie en musique, it is fairly obvious why the sight of a vulture eating a human heart "did not appeal to the public", requiring that the bird's meal not be "served a second time". The discomfort and repulsion of the audience that required a scenography revision reveals an anxiety over the differentiation in nourishment for human and non-human animals and the possible reversal of the human omnivore' s practices, something which the merveilleux might easily perform. Contrary to much modern performance practice, the machines, non-human animals, and monsters, in the ballet de cour and the tragédie en musique were not toys, and their appearance at crucial moments in tragic contexts was not intended to introduce comedy or to lighten a too-heavy dramatic atmosphere. Rather, the uneasiness and fear that could be aroused by the merveilleux operated in part by engaging the uneasy anthro- pocentrism of the audience, thereby following the Aristotelian precept that tragedy must elicit pity and terror.48 Perhaps the most disturbing manner of creating this terror was to engage anthropomorphic anxiety while unmasking what lies beneath culinary artifice. In act V, scene 8 of Lully and Quinaulťs Thésée, the stage instructions indicate that as Médée flees in her dragon chariot, "the food prepared for the feast changes into horrible Animals."49 In a society that was already somewhat nervous about the ethics of eating non-human animals, the idea of being devoured by one's own dinner was disturbing. As with Les Danaïdes, later versions of the libretto for Thésée were altered so that the guests, rather than themselves being in danger of becoming a meal, "s'imagine être poursuivis par des fantômes" (imagine themselves pursued by ghosts). Apparently, being pursued by ghosts, which are at least understandable through notions of the human, is less frightening than being hunted by non-human animals, who are far less predictable. Furthermore, the original sceno- graphy upsets the Cartesian order. According to Descartes, non-human animals have no souls, so the Cartesian meat-eater could be reassured that they had no ghosts either, a thought that would be plunged into grave doubt if the ghosts of one's meat were able to return to haunt the diner. The ballet de cour and the tragédie en musique, engaged spectators' anthropocentric anxiety over notions of species distinction, which was heightened by fear of the demonic and the supernatural. This aspect of such spectacles constitutes them as rich performative sites revealing, through the merveilleux, moments of anthro- pomorphic terror in early modern France where theories of Cartesian rationality had not been fully imposed.
