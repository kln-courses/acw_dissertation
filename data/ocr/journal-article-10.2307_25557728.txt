<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sounding The Depths IRISH MUSEUM OF MODERN ART, DUBLIN I April-9 May 1992 In a recent conversation with David Brett, Declan McGonagle stated that whilst the programmes he intended to implement at IMoMA should "speak across boundaries or categories of ghettos rather than reinforce them", he would be developing "programmes and events that deal specif ically with women making art and the art made by women"1 Sounding the Depths, a collaborative installation by Pauline Cummins and Louise Walsh, which was the result of a residency at the museum, is one such programme. The work itself took the form of a three-part installation, employ ing a variety of media - photographs, colour laser photocopies taken from 35mm slides, video and sound. A large photocopied image of hands holding a partially opened shell acted as a frontispiece to the installation, suggesting many of the concerns which are further de veloped in the rest of the work. The shell is simultaneously displayed and concealed. It emerges from the darkened space of the image, held partially open. Given this presentation , the viewer is made aware that it is not so much the shell in its physicality which is to be contemplated, but the possi bilities of meanings which it holds out in a symbolic system which embraces and supersedes the 'natural'. The shell then, wrested from its mundane physical existence and re-presented in its presence/ab sence as image, is imbued with a certain significance in a web of symbolism. The echoes of the sea which attach to it now are imagi nary. This is made explicit in the third and final section of the instal lation where the sounds of the 'seabed'2 gurgling water and female laughter commingle so that one is given to understand the sea as not merely physical, but mythical, a place where female laughter may just as easily belong to women, mermaids or sirens.3 The art historical references such as Botticelli's Birth of Venus alluded to by the imagery further suggests this association between the female body/sexuality/sea/myth. This cluster of terms is repeat ed and worked through the imagery that follows. For example, at one point in the video of the second section, the naked body of one of the artists is being enclosed by the shell through the use of a slow dissolve. The theme of closure/openness implied in the frontispiece seems to provide the main logic of movement both within each sequence of images and, more generally, in the movement from one section of the installation to the next. For example, in a series of four images which, displayed one above the other in the small ante-room of the first section, are almost totemic in their configuration, pursed lips draw back to reveal clenched teeth. This mouth imagery, taken up again in the second section, slowly opens up to the point where, to wards the end of the video, the camera, and hence the viewer, gazes down an open mouth and throat which appears tunnel-like in the darkened space of the screen. This gives way to the final video se quence - an opened, smiling mouth projected onto the naked torso of one of the artists, which re-doubles the sense of opening by giv ing the visual impression of the body itself splitting open. The mouth/body conflation then forms the basis for the series of large cibachromes in the final space. 6 4 CIRCA</page><page sequence="2">These images of a splitting open of the female body via an open mouth projected onto the torso are resonant with meanings, sug gesting simultaneously the violence of birth - a splitting open, inner life exposed and turned outwards. The merging of mouth, maternal body and non-linguistic sound, evokes the pre-verbal orality associ ated with infantile sexuality and the intimacy of the pre-Oedipal mother/child chora - a site where the phallic mother is omnipotent, laughing or devouring, giver and taker of life. In one photograph the mouth is projected vertically onto the body in a move which explicitly refers to the ancient Celtic figure of female fertility, the Sile-na-Gig. Given the slippage between the lips of mouth and vagina which this allusion entails, the vagina dentata suggests itself, registering a si multaneous fascination and dread of sexuality associated with the fe male body. As this body is figured here as overwhelmingly fertile and maternal, one might read here a reflection of the concern ex pressed by many feminists that, within a patriarchal culture, the de sires and sexuality of women who are mothers are disavowed and, subordinated to the function of childbearer and carer, regarded as an abomination.4 The movement from a notion of 'closure' to 'openness' articulat ed through the imagery, coincides spatially with the viewer's move ment from 'exterior' to 'interior' - ie from the small, naturally-lit ante-room, through the darkened corridor of the video section and into the final darkened room. This arrangement is strongly sugges tive of a certain anthropomorphism on the structural level of the in stallation, bringing to mind anthropomorphic caves such as Pech Merle, dedicated to the worship of Mother Earth. The evocations of the archaic phallic mother, the Sile-na-Gig and other mythic females re-inforces this impression. In the accompanying information sheet produced by IMoMA, the viewer was instructed to understand the work as a "visualisation through photography, video and sound of an emotional development. As human beings we develop ways of protecting ourselves by building shells as ways of closing off hurtful experiences. The tentative opening mouths ... show the beginnings of the necessary but painful process of opening up and release. ... An opening mouth projected onto a naked torso, which is the cen tre of energy, symbolises a wound being opened, revealing our insides and inner feelings". The final series of photographs then represents "...a celebration of that change. " If one accepts this reading of the work, which one must presume was produced in consultation with the artists, then it becomes apparent that the show deals with one of the most frequent themes in popular feminist fiction - the narrative of female self-development. Rita Felski, writing about feminist fiction, has identified two main forms which such narratives of self development take. In one, the heroine achieves an inner strength through effecting change on her external/historical world, whilst the other narrative charts her inter nal development with reference to a notion of a 'true self. Despite the difference in media, the theme of an emotional devel opment achieved through a return to the space of the archaic moth er, has much in common with this second narrative structure, a form which Felski argues is informed by "...a strong strain of romantic indi vidualism, which is critical of modernity and progress and typically situates truth and meaning in an edenic past rather than in the future".* It could be argued that what I am reading as a rejection of the ethics of progress and modernity and an eschewing of the historical in favour of an a-historical/utopian space is counteracted by the use of photographic media in the imaging of the body, thereby anchor ing it in the Real. The fact that the artists occupy that original recorded space may also bolster this supposition. However, this sense of historical specificity is undermined much more decisively by the 'disembodiment' of hands, mouth and torso which emerge from the nebulous darkened space they occupy in both photographs and video and dissolve one into the other. The dissolution is coupled ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^BB:'. '^^wammmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmW -^mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm with an interchangeability of the artists' bodies themselves so that as images of hands, mouth and torso dissolve into one another or are doubled up on one another, they belong to either one or the other but similarly neither one nor the other, both and neither. In the final series of photographs the artists are again identifiable although the general movement and gestures of both are still interchangeable and the projected mouth on their torso/s could belong to either. That the artists are not at any point imaged as occupying the same physi cal space also works to identify them with and locate them in a de tached/lost mythical space. In the catalogue the artists make reference to female sexuality and sexual orientation as being one of the concerns which informed the work. Given this, one might read the deliberate blurring of the boundaries of identity and difference between the two women, achieved through the use of dissolves, super-imposition and substitu tion, as an oblique representation of desire and eroticism between women. Ironically, insofar as the emphasis in the imagery is on orali ty in conjunction with fertility and the maternal, they also suggest, perhaps inadvertently, a peculiarly Freudian understanding of lesbian sexuality as an underdeveloped/immature form of sexuality , fixated on orality and a desire to re-merge with the body of the mother - a concept which works to obscure the possibility of mature sexual re lationships between women based on an eroticism which does not pivot either on the phallus or the maternal, but which is, however, Pauline Cummins and Louise Walsh, Sounding the Depths, Video Installation, 1992. CIRCA 65</page><page sequence="3">rooted as much in the reality of the differences between women in terms of class, age, lived experience etc. as in the similarities. The non-linguistic sounds of the body which feature in the instal lation - gasping, the sound of the tongue shifting in its bed of saliva and, finally, laughter - in conjunction with the mouth/body overlay suggest what has been described in French feminist writings as a 'speaking through the body\ As articulated in the work, it relates most closely to Julia Kristeva's account of this as an eruption of the pre-Oedipal semiotic, which according to Kristeva, must be re pressed if the subject is to take up his/her place as a speaking being in the Symbolic Order. However, she argues, the semiotic (which she associates with the feminine) still occupies a marginal, if re pressed place within this system and consequently cannot be totally repressed. This then resurfaces in the form of disruptive non-linguis tic utterances, contradictions, meaninglessness, silences, absences and non-linearity.6 Consequently, whilst a certain protestation/dissatis faction may be expressed in this form, representing a certain chal lenge to the dominant Symbolic Order, the articulation of a com plex politicised agenda is difficult to achieve and sustain in this form. Hilary Robinson picks up on this aspect of the work in her cata logue essay, referring to Clement's and Cixous's discussion of the similar positions occupied by both sorceress and hysteric in relation to language and power. Robinson suggests that, given her marginal status, the woman-artist might also occupy 'similar territory' to these figures.7 It might be considered salutary that Cixous and Clement fi nally arrive at something of a deadlock when they try to assess the ultimate symbolic importance these figures might hold or the politi cal efficacy of a speech act which can be so easily recuperated and closed off again. This movement from 'inner tension* to 'emotional openness', identified by Louise Walsh as "the final stage where we aspire to be a lot of the time", is presented in terms of an inner journey, a stripping away of the layers until one unearths a hidden powerful self. The fe male viewer is encouraged to embark on a similar process of self dis covery. The political strategy adopted here is a familiar one in terms of feminist artistic practices - the encouragement of a sense of shared identity, strength and community between women based on the af firmation of a common experience of fertility and childbirth articu lated through the evocation of a by-gone age in which women were considered sacred and powerful because of this reproductive capaci ty. Yet despite the fact that a sense of community and solidarity be tween women is a necessary prerequisite for women grouping to gether to effect political change, it is still a strategy which is inher ently problematic. In this work, for example, the explicit locating of female power/strength in fertility and childbirth in conjunction with the evocation of the Sile-na-Gig, Mother Earth etc., suggests the exis tence of a timeless, self-evident, privileged relationship between Woman and Nature which only has to be re-discovered and 'prop erly' appreciated. Given the long history of women being denied ac cess to the realms of cultural discourse precisely on the basis of their supposed privileged relationship with nature, and the use of the con cepts of 'the natural' and 'nature* to control women's bodies and lives, (this being played out again in the contraception and abortion debates), it is clear that neither 'Woman', 'Nature', nor the repro ductive process exist in a timeless vacuum outside the realm of social discourse. Similarly, the meariings accruing to each concept are nei ther self-evident nor fixed, having been disputed on many different levels across many different discourses. Thus, rather than either celebrating or identifying with a notion of female power based on the concept of the inherent alterity of her nature which is rooted in the female body itself, I am suggesting that a re-investigation and problematisation of all terms in the equation might prove more useful, so that one might arrive at a better under standing of how a specific organisation of the meanings accruing to the body, nature, desire, femininity etc., may influence the actual power or lack of it enjoyed by women in a given society. Finally, whilst the viewer's reading of the work will to some ex tent be influenced by such factors as age, gender, education etc., the context - in terms of the museum itself and the programme of events surrounding the show - also inevitably informs its under standing. The work itself was extensively contextualised in almost exclusively feminist and women-oriented terms via a series of discus sions, readings and workshops, many of which were informative and enjoyable, if somewhat tangential. However, whilst much was made in the catalogue of the surface similarities between Sounding the Depths and other works by international women artists, little at tempt was made over the course of these events to address the work specifically in terms of the strategies adopted, the implications and suitability of these and their possible relationship with other aesthetic and political theories and practices, both feminist and otherwise. This was an oversight which, given McGonagle's concern to inte grate rather than ghettoise 'women making art and art made by women', must be seen as something of a lost opportunity. Jaki Irvine 1.
