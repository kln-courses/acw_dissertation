<plain_text><page sequence="1">A MORTAR AND A ROCK-CARVING IN JAMAICA. By A. D. LacaiUe. Illu8trated. 6 6 An archaeological study of domestic stone vessels in Britain has led me to seek com- parisons abroad. Among the records accumu- ated, many from the habitation-sites of peoples now extinct have much in common with instances noted at home. An example to which attention is drawn here (fig. 1) was discovered by me in 1925 in Jamaica. It is ascribed to the aborigines of that island, who hewed it out of a huge piece of coral-limestone rock, probably fallen away from the inland cliff, on the edge of the Cockpit Country, near Pantrepant, Trelawny. A.-The improvised vessel stands opposite an opening in the rock-face to the south. This was one of several rock-shelters to which I had been conducted by Dr. Campbell, of Pantrepant, to see an anthropomorphic figure incised on the rock- wall. The elliptical basin (fig. 1), 26 inches by 20 inches, has the appearance of having been fashioned by stone hammers, and is worn fairly smooth in the centre by constant pounding within it. Used with a pestle, it could have served as a mortar; with a mall or pounder, the cavity could have been employed in the same way as the heavy but movable Scottish knockin' stane,' that most elementary of pot-querns (Arthur Mitchell, The Past in the Present, 1880, pp. 445). As the Jamaican utensil may be ascribed to the Arawatks, it was probably used in the preparation of cassava or pulses. Among many other purposes, it could also have been used for pounding grits and paste for that excellent pottery, which has been yielded by a number of sites in Jamaica. As a communal vessel, the Jainaican specimen finds many parallels, those from North America being particularly well known. It is interesting, however, to recall that in the Scottish Highlands alone some rock-surfaces at clachans or crofts - ~~~~~4 - FIG. 1.-ROCK-CUT MORTAR, JAMAICA. Height, 39 inches. 6 i n.

All utensils for pounding are cognate. Their origin lies in that convenient surface upon which it occurred to early man to pulverize something by means of a hammer or pestle. That the sur- face should have presented itself as a depression would make it more attractive. The hollow may have been improved by pecking out. Very probably the Jamaican basin here figured is a case in point. B.-The carving I had gone to examine near Pantrepant was seen to be more elaborate than as noted in the Journal of the Institute of Jamaica, 1897. It is cut on the projecting rock beside the opening, immediately facing the basin and 10 feet 3 inches from it. The illustration (fig. 2), repro- duced from a rubbing, shows the assemblage. Many other and unrecorded carvings, as deeply incised, were detected on the surrounding rock- walls. As mere outlines of human heads, with the eyes and mouth only represented by small pits, they are in keeping with most Arawak scribings found in similar conditions in Jamaica.</page></plain_text>
