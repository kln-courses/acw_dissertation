It seems to this reviewer that these remarks approach being incursions into the history of aesthetics. The presence of the comment on Parker's lectures, particularly, casts a shadow on this otherwise praiseworthy edition. Completeness (not to mention fair play) should have required some documentation of this judgment. If a definite counter movement is present in American aesthetics, one which challenges the very way the craft is conducted, that is an important historical fact. These last comments are made with no intention of detracting from the gain to be secured from reading this volume. This is a welcome addition to the history of ideas, especially aesthetic ideas, in America. Clearly, aesthetic interests have been much as Baym reports. Increasingly, it has become evident that, however entwined with European tradition and metaphysical concerns, aesthetics here has developed a life and range of topics all its own. The fact that so much is tidily woven together without a denial of the distinct contri- butions of so many persons will leave the reader with a sense of where aesthetics in America has come from. James F. O'Leary Rosary Hill College, Buffalo MIND AND ART: AN ESSAY ON THE VARIETIES OF EXPRES- SION by Guy Sircello. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1972, xiii + 349 pp., $13.50. This philosophical investigation into the concept of expression is relevant, but not directly so to the concerns of aesthetic education. Its relevance arises from what it has to say about the nature of mind, and the fact that the author introduces his argument through a consideration of the treatment accorded the Expression Theory of Art by Beardsley, Bouwsma, et al. From the point of view of aesthetic theory the book is of interest in re-opening questions most aestheticians had regarded as laid to rest. From the perspective of philosophy of mind its interest would appear to stem from a de-emphasis of the con- scious, coupled with the introduction of arguments for what the author calls a "Romantic view," one which emphasizes the mind's "radical originality and irreducible internality" (p. 14). Teachers of art and art education cannot but be interested in the nature of mind, the relation between mind and art, and the use of language in criticism and the classroom. Nevertheless, the reader should be aware that the thrust of the book is from aesthetic ques- tions back toward more fundamental questions about the nature of mind, rather than forward to educational practice or theory. The view espoused by Beardsley and Bouwsma can be summarized in terms of the argument that a statement of the form "X is a sad symphony" can be reduced to the form, "X has such and such distinguishable features which can be referred to by the anthropomorphic predicate 'sad.'" "Sad" in "sad symphony" is metaphoric in a way that "sad" in "sad person" is not. For Beardsley and Bouwsma statements about expressive properties of works of art are to be treated as if they were disguised statements about "qualities"</page><page sequence="2">118 BOOK REVIEWS or "characters" of works of art. The metaphors are only as good as their cash value. Nor does the "sadness" of a symphony tell us anything about the state of the composer's mind at the moment of composition. Sircello's response to what he calls the "Canonical Position" is twofold. On the one hand he examines a variety of expressive attributions in critical contexts, trying to distinguish their use from "natural" predicates such as "red." He wants to show that supporters of the Canonical Position have not sufficiently investigated the logic of expressive predicates. On the other hand he identifies what he calls "artistic acts." If we speak of a painter as viewing his subject serenely, the verb "views" may be taken as designating an artistic act. Such acts, he says, are to be distinguished by the fact that they are "not identifiable or describable independently of the works 'in' which they are done" (p. 22). Since Sircello wants to call anything an artistic act which 1) may be "denoted by a verb whose subject is" an artist (p. 296), and 2) "is ap- plied to the work of art in virtue of what the artist does in that work" (p. 26), we can readily see that the Aristotelian criterion of intention in acts may be dispensed with in "artistic acts." For it is clear that we might wish to speak of an artist as "viewing his subject serenely," when in fact he would deny it. Beardsley's example of A. E. Houseman's poem for Queen Victoria's birth- day makes the point cleanly. The concept of "artistic act" is important to Sircello in that it enables him to bridge the gap between artist and aesthetic object since "descriptions of them [artistic acts] are at once and necessarily descriptions of art works" (p. 29). Sircello goes on to argue in opposition to the Canonical Position that the Expression Theory is capable of extending beyond single anthropomorphic predicates. "Love of nature" in a painting, "imagination" in a novel, are ex- amples of attributions which he feels must be seen as manifestations of "person" in art beyond the mere presence of a quality in the work itself. He insists that it is not necessary to treat such attributions as applying either to the artist or to the work. He sees them as applying simultaneously to both. Nor is it necessary, he says, to resort to external biographical information in order to hold that such statements refer to the artist. The painting itself may provide sufficient evidence of the artist's "love of nature." This claim enables him to extend the conceptual domain of the "artistic act" enormously. By his use of the term even scientific writing is "as anthropomorphic and hence as expressive as are passionate angry or tender ways of talking and writing" (p. 121). Indeed it would seem that any human making could be talked of in this way. Sircello is more modest. My claim is a relatively restricted one: namely, that works of art, history, philosophy, science, and indeed of any activity requiring the use of language share an important feature with ordinary sorts of expressions like gestures, grimaces, and inarticulate cries. This feature is that they are construable as "acts" characteristic of persons who have certain emotions, feelings or attitudes, who are in particular moods or states of mind, or who possess certain personality, character, temperamental, or mental traits (p. 130). Having arrived at this point, Sircello feels it incumbent upon him to</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 119 examine the concept of expression in its most general sense. He devotes space to linguistic analysis of "expression" in its various ordinary forms. He argues that objective expression is not a species of representation (for example in "La Mer expresses the many moods of the sea..."), but is "essentially a va- riety of artistic act" (p. 155). The same holds for expressions of ideas ("Praxiteles expressed in his Hermes the classic Greek notion that man is a beautiful and dignified creature.") Sircello next engages the question of what it is to be an expression of someone's feeling. In some cases he says an expression of feeling is a sign of the feeling it expresses. Generally speak- ing, the more vivid an expression the less likely it is to function as a sign. In rejecting the possibility that expressions relate to what they signify he is led to make a distinction between showing that and showing in. Signs show that something is the case. But expressions show what they signify, and what they signify shows in them. In considering the causal provenance of expression Sircello argues ingeni- ously, and at length, against the view that the road to expression is through intention. One may apply or exercise a skill but not what is shown in one's expressive acts. A brave act is always done deliberately and it may be done deliberately because it is brave. By contrast, if the "properly" expressive way in which any "act" is done is the result of deliberateness on the part of the actor, the act ipso facto fails to express what it appears to express.... This is not to say that one may not deliberately perform an act which is expressive of one's feeling, however. It is merely that one cannot de- liberately perform it under its properly expressive description. When angry, one may deliberately throw the china and even deliberately throw it violently. One may not deliberately throw it angrily, however, if it is to count as an expression of one's anger (p. 262). The significance of Sircello's account of expression for the theory of mind is as follows. If he is correct, expression differs from most mental phenomena in that intention is irrelevant to it. Moreover, "the realm of expression has been found not to presuppose phenomenological interiority or any sort of self- consciousness based upon the latter" (p. 298). That which is expressed is inner, mental, in the sense of being inherent. It is "an overall characteristic of a pattern of [an expresser's] acts, both actual and possible, such that [that which is expressed] shows in these acts..." (p. 296). Sircello calls his theory Romantic, because it emphasizes the primacy of mind. It is from this vantage point that he attacks what he sees as a positivistic tendency to rigidly delineate the art object and the artist. At the same time his denial of a phenomenological source of what is expressed is not such as "to give any comfort to the obscurantist tendencies of Romanticism" (p. 299). It is hard to say what the long term implications of Sircello's argument for educational theory and practice might be. If the theory of mind were to move in the direction he suggests the consequences could be considerable. The attack on the Canonical Position is, in my opinion, of lesser significance than the main argument, and more open to reply. A chief merit of Sircello's attack on the Canonical Position lies in the variety of his examples. If nothing</page><page sequence="4">120 BOOK REVIEWS else, it should serve the purpose of forcing the defenders to deal with a greater complexity of instances than the comparison of red apples and sad symphonies. Still, it is not easy to see what educational implications the establishment of Sircello's position might have beyond changes in critical language in the classroom. The implications of his more general theory of expression and the mind are potentially broader. Given his claim that expression does not fall within the realm of intention, all educational goals which call for the student's ex- pression or self-expression are open to question. A final chapter, in which he discusses self-expression, makes this clear. The possibilities which are opened need further investigation. It appears that this may be a book which will have considerable, if indirect, significance for aesthetic educational theory. Walter H. Clark, Jr. University of Michigan ENGLISH FOR A NEW GENERATION by Hans P. Guth. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1973, 296 pp., $8.95. Increasing dissatisfaction with public school education has sent educators scurrying to examine the curriculum in the school and to make it relevant to the needs of our floundering students. Now Hans Guth comes with an English for a New Generation. What is this "new" English he proposes? It substitutes the study of linguistics for that of formal grammar. It views the dialectic deviations from standard English as part of the living language. It sees composition as a creative process that uses the students' own reactions and experiences for content and even structure. It embraces literature, but it renounces literary history and formal aesthetics to concentrate on "rele- vance," for literature, says Guth, must minister "directly to the intellectual and spiritual needs of the adolescent." The new English, therefore, turs to all forms of contemporary writing - science fiction, black literature, the liter- ature of other ethnic cultures - and to the study of television and the film. The program is not a revolutionary one, for as we survey the current English curriculum, we note again and again that the schools have already ventured into the study of linguistics, the use of paperbacks, units on themes in literature, creative writing, the study of television and the film, remedial reading, and special programs for so-called disadvantaged students. In other words, Guth seems to be a little late with his proposals, although we must add that more than ten years ago his English Today and Tomorrow pointed the way. Late or not, in general his program should be encouraged, for, as he insists throughout the book, unless the individual student is personally in- volved in the study of language and literature, the curriculum in English becomes a sterile one indeed. Several notes of caution, however, should be sounded here. Merely turning to linguistics instead of grammar will not solve the problems we face in teaching language. As Guth admits, "Today, English teachers no longer look to the linguist for one final truth about language. Instead, they are learning how to learn from linguists without taking sides among competing systems</page></plain_text>
