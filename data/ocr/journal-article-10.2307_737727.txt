PARMA ROTARY CLUB INTERNATIONAL PRIZE Giuseppe Verdi 1995 The Rotary Club of Parma, in conjunction with the National Institute of Verdi Studies announces the Parma Rotary Club International Prize "Giuseppe Verdi", to be awarded to a scholar intending to undertake research on a Verdian topic at the National Institute of Verdi Studies at Parma, concluding with the presentation of a typed monograph to the Institute. The competition, open to Italian and foreign scholars, is intended for research projects to be completed between September 1996 and Spring 1998; the prize consists of 12 million It-Lire, to be paid after the work is completed (interim payments to a maximum of 50% of the total may be granted). In no way should the prize be understood as an all-inclusive scholarship. Entry to the competition will be through the presentation of detailed proposal, specifying as much as possible the subject matter and the research materials the scholar intends to use. The panel which will evaluate the research projects will consist of the Acting-President (or an authorised representative) of the Rotary Club of Parma, the Director of the National Institute of Verdi Studies, and another person chosen by agreement between these two. In evaluating submissions, the panel will take into account, in order of importance, the originality of the research project, the academic qualifications of the proposer, the feasibility of completing the project within the time limits stated above. All other matters being equal, the panel will give preference to a project which involves research into documentary material which is unpublished, or at least not presently available at the Institute. Applications should be sent to the Istituto nazionale di studi verdiani, Strada della Repubblica 56, 1-43100 Parma, Italy - Tel. 0521/286044 - Fax. 0521/287949. Deadline: 30 September 1995.
