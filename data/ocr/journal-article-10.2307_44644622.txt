Wolanin Safety Research and Development Lab Environmental Activities Staff, General Motors Corp. GENERAL MOTORS HAS BEEN A LEADER in the development of anthropomorphic test dummies. During the period from 1971 through 1976, four generations of dummies, Hybrid I, Hybrid II, ATD 502, and Hybrid III, have evolved. The products of this evolutionary process have become more usable as automotive test devices. With each generation, the ability to assess the performance of restraint systems and passenger compartment design has improved. The improvements brought to. the state-of-the-art by Hybrid III can be put into perspective by viewing them with respect to pro- ceeding dummies. HYBRID I Hybrid I was developed in 1971. In general, its major improvements over earlier dummy de- signs were standardization of parts which allowed: Interchangeability and ease of repair, improved test reproducibility, designated instrumentation locations, and improved documentation. The Hybrid I head was a modified Sierra 292-1050 design. It conformed to the requirements of J963 (1)*, had uniform head skin density, and provided triaxial acceleration measurement at the head center of gravity. A molded rubber neck was utilized which was repeatable, durable, but nonbiomechanical in its response characteristics. The thoracic structure had improved damping and durability, conformed to J963, and provided center of gravity triaxial acceleration measurement capability. Lower torso improvements included more anatomi- *Numbers in parentheses- designate References at end of paper. ABSTRACT This paper describes a new generation anthro- pomorphic dummy with component dynamic re- sponses which approximate available biomechanics data. This experimental test dummy, Hybrid HI, is based on the ATD 502 dummy which was de- veloped in 1973 by General Motors under contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Adminis- tration. Like the ATD 502, Hybrid ni features a biomechanically-based head design, human-like automotive seating posture, constant torque primary joints, and detailed documentation for fabrication. Hybrid III uniquely features a biomechanically- based neck, thorax, and knee covering. Trans- ducers for measurement of neck loads and chest deflection are integral parts of the design. While Hybrid III appears to provide a measur- able improvement over the present "standard" dummy (Part 572) in terms of component responses in frontal impacts, it is still far from the "ultimate" test dummy. Hybrid in does not, for example, provide substantial biofidelity improvements for lateral impacts. This and other desirable improve- ments must await additional biomechanics data. This paper describes the design and presents test results for three prototype dummies. Dynamic responses, relative to human cadaver and limited volunteer data, are presented for head, neck, thorax, and knee components. Performance of the Part 572 dummy is also presented for comparison. An evaluation of whole dummy repeatability and reproducibility during Hyge sled tests is described. Hybrid III and Part 572 dummy performances are compared. Additional work, which would be re- quired to more fully evaluate Hybrid III, is out- lined. This paper concludes that Hybrid III component responses are significantly closer to biomechanics data than those of the Part 572 dummy. The three prototypes are as repeatable as the Part 572 dummy and significantly more reproducible. 3268 0096-736X/78/8604-3268$02.50 Copyright © 1978 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">cally-correct pelvis geometry, femur load mea- surement via a standardized load cell, and an im- proved knee flesh covering. HYBRID II Hybrid II succeeded Hybrid I in 1972. It was the first dummy design to have acceptable repeat- ability combined with good durability and service- ability. Documentation was improved over the Hybrid I. As a result of its overall performance, this dummy was acceptable to General Motors for limited qualification testing of air cushion restraint vehicles to the requirements of FMVSS 208. To achieve Hybrid II's performance, the Hybrid I skull was redesigned to eliminate mechanical resonances, and to achieve a more anatomically-correct head/ neck interface. The hard-surface impact response of the head was also defined. While the Hybrid I rubber neck was retained, the neck mount was re- designed to improve the repeatability of head kine- matics. Response of the head/neck assembly was defined and documented. Improvements to the thoracic structure included self-centering shoulders and a better distribution of load in the shoulder region. These changes, in part, yielded more repeatable dummy responses. The lower torso incorporated a butyl rubber lumbar spine which improved the overall repeatability and reproduc- ibility of the dummy and increased its usability. Legs with extended range of motion were developed and utilized to improve the overall kinematics of the dummy. The hard-surface impact response of the kneeAeg structure was defined and docu- mented. ATD 502 The ATD 502 dummy was developed in 1973 under a contract with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Improvements over Hybrid II were achieved in several areas. The repeatability and reproducibility were im- proved over Hybrid II, dummy vehicle seating posture was more human-like, and some compo- nent designs and responses were based on bio- mechanics data. The drawings represented a significant improvement in the level of documenta- tion. The ATD 502 head incorporated biomechani- cally-based geometry, moment of inertia, and hard-surface impact response. Reproducibility of skull and head skin were improved over Hybrid II. A polyacrylate neck with improved damping characteristics was utilized. The neck mount was adjustable in angle (pitch axis) to allow the head to be correctly oriented upon seating the dummy in a vehicle. The thoracic structure, while similar in construction to Hybrid II, was redesigned in the shoulder to improve belt-to-shoulder interfacing. The shoulder joints were of an improved "constant torque" design. Triaxial acceleration measurement capability was provided at a redefined center of gravity. The lower torso utilized a curved, poly- acrylate lumbar spine to achieve a more human- like seating posture. Redesigned constant torque knee joints were also incorporated. The overall design specifications of the lower torso were im- proved over Hybrid II. HYBRID III Although the progression from Hybrid I through the ATD 502 produced many worthwhile and signifi- cant improvements, it was apparent by 1976 that additional hardware improvements and new design concepts were in order for the Hybrid II and ATD 502 dummy structures. In general, these "defi- ciencies" could be classified into three groups. The first, and most important, was the general lack of biomechanical response of the various components or structures, notably the neck, thorax, and knees. Second, the existing dummies were deficient both in design intent and in provision for the measurement of biomechanical parameters. These parameters included neck axial and shear loads, moment about the occipital condyles, and sternal-to-thoracic spine displacement. FinaHy, the documentation of the existing dummies was insufficient to allow reproduction of the dummy from the available drawings, casting patterns, and mold dies. To work toward reducing these apparent de- ficiencies, General Motors undertook the develop- ment of a new dummy, Hybrid III, in July of 1975. The primary objective was to design and build a dummy whose component response characteristics were consistent with available biomechanics data, while retaining or improving upon the best features and assets of the Hybrid II and ATD 502 designs. Secondary objectives included the ability to mea- sure additional parameters of the cervical and thoracic structures and to document the dummy in sufficient detail to assure reproducible fabrication of both skeletal (metallic) and soft tissue (elasto- meric) parts. The Hybrid III dummy which evolved embodies components and structures which have response characteristics based on biomechanics data avail- able in the literature. Test measurements related to these biomechanics data can be obtained in addi- tion to the conventional measurement of head and chest triaxial acceleration, and femur load. The serviceability, durability, and setup stability are improved over Hybrid II and ATD 502. Documenta- tion, while presently not completed, will enable dummies to be constructed having a higher degree of reproducibility than previous generations. While Hybrid III appears to provide a measur- 3269</page><page sequence="3">3270 J. K. FOSTER, ET AL. able improvement over its predecessors in terms of component biofidelity in frontal impacts, it is still far from the "ultimate" test dummy. Addi- tional improvements, however, must await better understanding of potential injury mechanisms during the crash impact and additional biomechanics data. FEATURES AND CONSTRUCTION WHOLE DUMMY - Hybrid III (Fig. 1) incorpo- rates the basic mainframe of the ATD 502 dummy which was developed under contract with the NHTSA. (A full description of the ATD 502 dummy may be found in Ref. 2. ) Significant deviations from the ATD 502 design include a new neck, thorax, re- distributed lower torso weight, and improved knee padding. Each of these changes was aimed at improving the biomechanical response of the dummy. Thus, Hybrid III maintains the many improvements of the ATD 502 over previous dummies, while adding improved biomechanical fidelity. HEAD - The head of Hybrid in (Fig. 2) is a direct carryover from ATD 502 which is described in detail in Ref. 3. This design was retained for Hybrid III because it represents state-of-the-art knowledge of human geometry, weight, inertia, and biomechanical response. The head features a precision casting of 356 aluminum with T6 heat treatment. Thickness of the vinyl skin is specified and closely controlled to assure biomechanical fidelity and repe atable head response in hard- Fig. 1 - Hybrid III utilizes the ATD 502 dummy mainframe and head, and features a new neck, thorax, and improved knee padding Fig. 2 - The head of Hybrid in is identical to the ATD 502 dummy head and consists of a precision aluminum casting covered by a vinyl skin</page><page sequence="4">HYBRID III 3271 surface impacts. Head acceleration is measured by three accelerometers, mounted orthogonally at the center of gravity. NECK - The Hybrid III neck is a one-piece, flexible component with biomechanical bending and damping responses in both flexion and extension (Fig. 3). Three rigid aluminum vertebral elements are molded in a 75-durometer (shore hardness) butyl elastomer to form the neck structure. This design is based on a concept developed by the General Motors Research Laboratories (GMR) and described in Ref. 4. The Hybrid in neck was de- signed to reduce fabrication cost and increase durability while maintaining the mechanical proper- ties and the geometric features of the GMR neck. The butyl elastomer was chosen for its high damping characteristic in order to approximate the biomechanical hysteresis requirements. Alumi- num end plates are molded into the neck to provide attachment surfaces. A single steel cable runs through the center of the neck to provide a high level of axial strength. Neck fabrication is per- formed by injecting the butyl elastomer into a neck mold which provides a cavity to define the neck geometry, and properly locates the three vertebral elements and two end plates. An asymmetrical cross-sectional geometry was selected to provide higher bending resistance to flexion than extension Fig. 3 - The neck is a one-piece, butyl elastomer and aluminum component. A special transducer measures forces and moments about the occipital condyles to match the biomechanics data. Saw cuts on the anterior half provide an additional reduction in extension bending resistance without affecting flexion response. A special transducer is used to measure axial and shear loads, and moment about the occipital condyle. This transducer attaches to the "Frank- fort plane" of the head and to the neck through a "nodding" joint. Like the GMR neck, the Hybrid III design features an adjustable neck bracket to enable leveling of the head when Hybrid III is seated in a vehicle. THORAX - Design of the Hybrid III thorax (Fig. 4) is similar to that of Hybrid II and ATD 502. The thorax assembly consists of a spine and rib cage covered by a removable chest jacket. The whole assembly is ballasted for correct weight and center of gravity location. The thoracic spine is of welded steel construction and provides for attachment of the neck, clavicles, ribs, and lumbar spine. It also houses a triaxial accelero- meter mount located at the assembly center of gravity. The rib cage assembly consists of six ribs made from 1074 steel heat-treated to Rockwell C50. Fig. 4 - The thorax assembly consists of a welded steel spine, steel ribs backed by a polyviscous damping material, and a ure thane bib</page><page sequence="5">3272 J. K. FOSTER, ET AL. The ribs are attached to the rear of the spine along with "helper" leaf springs to provide stress control. The ribs are contoured to simulate the human form and have a polyviscous damping material bonded to their inside surface to provide the proper chest dynamic response to blunt frontal impact. A ure- thane bib is attached to the front of the ribs to help distribute loads. The sternum is made of Delrin, backed by aluminum. The Delrin sternum also is part of the deflection measuring mechanism. The deflection transducer (Fig. 5) is a rotary poten- tiometer attached to the top of a bracket which extends over the lumbar spine. A rod extends from the deflection transducer to the sternum to provide input to the potentiometer. The chest design accommodates deflections of up to 90 mm. LUMBAR SPINE - The Hybrid ni lumbar spine basically is a carryover of the ATD 502 design. The spine is a molded, curved polyacrylate elas- tomer member with molded-in end plates for attachment to the thoracic spine and pelvis. Two Fig. 5 - The chest deflection transducer consists of a rotary potentiometer connected to the sternum through a rod and slider mechanism cables pass through the lumbar spine and attach to the end plates. These cables provide lateral seating stability while permitting fore and aft flexibility (Fig. 6). The curved lumbar spine allows the dummy to assume a slouched position when placed on a vehicle seat. This provides a more human-like seated posture and a more realis- tic eye location. Setup repeatability also is im- proved by allowing the dummy to be placed, rather than forced, into the desired seating position. LOWER BODY - The lower torso and legs of Hybrid III are similar to the ATD 502 (Fig. 7). Deviations from the ATD 502 design include cor- rected weight distribution of the lower body and legs, improved knee padding, and other minor modifications to improve serviceability and dur- ability. The weight distribution of the lower body and upper legs has been changed to meet the anthropometric goals established by Hubbard (5). This is addressed in more detail in the "Anthro- pometry" section of this paper. The Hybrid III knee consists of an aluminum casting, knee flesh insert, and an outer vinyl covering. The knee flesh insert is molded of 45-durometer butyl rubber to improve the dynamic response of the knee to hard-surface impacts. The outer vinyl covering has been reduced in thickness to maintain an overall knee covering thickness of 9. 0 mm, the same as the ATD 502. COMPONENTS AND BIOMECHANICS** HEAD - A simple drop test was used to evalu- ate the performance of the Hybrid III head relative to biomechanics data. Each head was dropped from a height of 376 mm onto a flat and rigid steel plate. Prior to impact, the head was suspended with the midsagittal plane vertical and the lowest point on the forehead 13 mm below the lowest point on the nose (Fig. 8). Three orthogonal linear acceleration measurements were made at the head center of gravity. Head response is the resultant of these acceleration measurements. Biomechanical performance was evaluated by comparing peak resultant acceleration to the guide- lines reported by Hubbard and McLeod in Ref. 3. These guidelines specify that a peak resultant acceleration of 225 to 275 gfs be obtained in a 376-mm drop. Three Hybrid IE heads were tested three times each. One Hybrid n head was tested for comparison. A time interval of 2 h was main- tained between replicate tests on the same head to allow time for recovery of the vinyl flesh covering. **Metric equivalents of English units reported in some cited references were calculated by the authors of this paper.</page><page sequence="6">HYBRID III 3273 Fig. 6 - Two cables pass through the polyacrylate elastomer lumbar spine to provide lateral seating stability. The curved geometry of the spine pro- vides a human-like seated posture and eye location Fig. 7 - The lower torso and legs of Hybrid III are similar to the ATD 502. Changes include corrected weight distribution and improved knee padding Data were processed to SAE J211a Channel Class 1000 requirements (6). Head performances relative to the Hubbard and McLeod biomechanical guidelines are shown in Fig. 9. Responses of all three Hybrid III heads are distributed well within the corridor. The Hybrid II peak resultant head acceleration exceeds the upper limit of the corridor. This Hybrid II head met the response requirements of Part 572 (7) when drop-tested as specified in Part 572. NECK - Biomechanical performance guidelines for mechanical necks are reported by Mertz, Neathery, and Culver in Ref. 8. The response guidelines specify moment versus angle and damping relationships in defined flexion and extension tests. These are whole dummy tests and are performed with a special rigid seating fixture. Three Hybrid III necks were tested in flexion and extension a minimum of twice each. The seating fixture was a duplicate of that used by Mertz et al. at Wayne State</page><page sequence="7">3274 J.K. FOSTER, ET AL. Fig. 8 - Head impact response was determined from drop tests onto a rigid steel plate University (8). Typical flexion and extension test setups are shown in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively. The rigid seat was constructed of steel angles with a plywood bottom and back. The dummy was re- strained with preloaded mid-torso, lap, and dual shoulder belts. The fixture was accelerated to a pretest velo- city and then allowed to gradually decelerate to the test velocity, at which time the test began. A headrest was used to support the dummy's head during the acceleration of the fixture. Hexcel absorbers provided a square wave deceleration during the test. Head angle, relative to the upper torso, was measured from high-speed motion pictures acquired at a rate of 500 frames per second. Moment about the occipital condyles was measured by the dummy's neck load transducer. Data were processed to SAE J211a Channel Class 60 requirements. Table 1 summarizes the sled parameters for both flexion and extension tests. Neck flexion responses are plotted relative to the Mertz et al.corridor (8) in Fig. 12.

Hybrid III Neck 1 appears to have a different extension response than those of Necks 2 and 3. This apparent difference in response is not necessarily an indication of neck characteristic differences, but could be due to a relatively high test variability and low number of replicate tests. As seen in Figs. 12 and 13, the Hybrid III neck responses generally fall within the corridor. The minimum moment guidelines and minimum hysteresis guideline for flexion are not met. The effects of these deficiencies on automotive crash test results are unknown at this time. However, the overall Hybrid III neck flexion and extension responses are significantly closer to the biomech- anicai response corridors than those of Hybrid II. THORAX - Biomechanical thorax response corridors have been developed by Neathery (9). These corridors define dynamic load-deflection characteristics in blunt frontal impacts. The test conditions were those of Part 572 with the excep- tion of dummy positioning. The impactor mass was 23. 4 kg and impact velocities were 4. 3 and 6. 7 m/s. Responses of three Hybrid III chest structures were measured using a ballistic pendulum impactor. The test setup is shown in Fig. 14. Each dummy was positioned on a flat surface such that the ribs were parallel to the seating surface and the im- pactor was centered on the sternum. Impact force was obtained from the product of pendulum mass and deceleration. Chest deflection was obtained from a potentiometer which measured the longi-</page><page sequence="10">HYBRID III 3277 tudinal displacement of the sternum relative to the thoracic spine. Data were processed to SAE J211a Channel Class 180 requirements. Three replicate tests on each Hybrid III thorax were performed. An interval of 15 min was maintained between repeat tests to allow time for recovery of the elastomeric materials. One Hybrid II, which met the specifications of Part 572, was also tested for comparison. Dynamic responses are shown in Figs. 15 and 16 relative to the expanded data base corridors developed by Neathery. Each curve represents the mean response obtained in three replicate tests performed on each chest. As seen in Figs. 15 and 16, Hybrid III responses are significantly closer to the biomechanical corridors than those of Hybrid n. KNEES - Knee padding response is defined as that contribution to the total knee impact response which results from characteristics of the knee covering material. Padding response is isolated from the total response by increasing the subject's mass several orders of magnitude. Horsch and Patrick refer to this as the "leg rigidly mounted" condition in their work at Wayne State University (10). This work produced knee padding response data for five cadaver legs with three pendulum impactor masses and one impact velocity. Biomechanical performance of Hybrid III knees was evaluated by comparison of peak knee impact force to the cadaver data. The dummy legs were disassembled at the proximal end of the femur load cell. A mounting fixture was used to rigidly connect the leg assembly Fig. 14 - Thoracic impact response was deter- mined by using a ballistic pendulum impactor 8r 4.3 METRE/SEC IMPACT HYBRID II 2 / / HYBRID m ^ / / 2 UJ 4 " ^ 0I - 1 1 1 0 20 40 60 80 STERNAL DEFLECTION-mm Fig. 15 - Thoracic impact responses to blunt impacts at 4. 3 m/s are shown relative to the Neathery 50th percentile male corridor</page><page sequence="11">3278 J.

The test setup is shown in Fig. 17. Each upper leg was mounted horizontally with the lower leg positioned at an angle of 1. 15 radians relative to the upper leg. Knee joint torque was adjusted to provide the minimum torque neces- sary to support the lower leg when extended horizon- tally. Three pendulum impactors of differing mass and face diameter were used, as shown in Table 2. The pendulum impactors were positioned so that their cente rlines coincided with the femur axis at impact. A single axis accelerometer was mounted on the rear of each impactor to measure pendulum deceleration during impact. Pendulum mass and deceleration were used to compute the knee impact force. Three replicate tests were performed on each knee of three Hybrid III dummies. One pair of Hybrid II dummy knees was also tested for com- parison. A time interval of 30 min was maintained between repeat tests on the same knee to allow time for recovery of the knee padding material. Data were processed to SAE J211a Channel Class 1000 requirements. Fig. 18 compares Hybrid in and Hybrid II knee padding responses to the Wayne State University data. This figure shows the responses of five cadaver legs. The responses of three replicate tests on six Hybrid in knees and two Hybrid II knees are plotted. Inspection of these data show that Hybrid III knee padding responses are dis- tributed in the range of the cadaver data. The distribution of Hybrid II responses is above that of the cadavers. ANTHROPOMETRY - Anthropometry is the basis for the design and evaluation of crash test dummy geometry. Available human data are based on measurements made relative to the erect or upright seated position since this orientation has been traditionally used for anthropometric measurements. Previous dummies, except the ATD 502, have been designed to assume the erect seated position as a natural or stable orientation.</page><page sequence="12">HYBRID III 3279 Table 2 - Pendulum Impactors Pendulum Mass Pendulum Face Diameter Drop Height (ki lograms) (mi 1 1 îmetres) (mi 1 1 i met res) 0.5 51 226 1.5 51 226 2.0 76 226 Fig. 18 - Dummy knee impact forces are compared to cadaver responses determined by Horsch and Patrick However, dummies are used in an automotive seated position rather than this erect position. Hybrid III, like ATD 502, has been designed to naturally assume an automotive seated position. The dummy can be preloaded into an erect seated orientation for anthropometric measurements. Anthropometric guidelines for exterior body dimensions, pivot locations, segment weights, and segment center of gravity locations were developed for the design of the ATD 502 and are reported by Hubbard. Cut planes were defined to correspond with convenient dummy disassembly points. This eliminates the need to destroy parts when making anthropometric measurements. The ATD 502 design generally is consistent with anthro- pometric guidelines. Hybrid III anthropometry is identical to that of the ATD 502 reported in Ref. 2 with the following exceptions: a. upper torso mass and center of gravity location, b. lower torso mass and center of gravity location, c. upper leg mass and center of gravity location. These segment weights and center of gravity locations were adjusted to make Hybrid III more closely agree with the anthropometric guidelines established by Hubbard. The results of this effort are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. These tables compare both the ATD 502 and Hybrid III to anthro- pometric goals for segment weights and center of gravity locations. Listed below is a summary of the changes made to the ATD 502 to obtain Hybrid III segment weights and center of gravity locations. 1. Neck transducer replaced the ATD 502 head-to-neck adapter with no change in head inertial properties. 2. Neck weight was increased 0. 3 kg. 3. Upper torso weight was increased 0. 8 kg. Center of gravity was moved down 18 mm and rearward 5 mm. 4. Lower torso weight was increased 4. 7 kg. Center of gravity was moved up 5 mm and rear- ward 11 mm. 5. Upper leg weight (each) was reduced 2. 1 Kg. Inspection of Tables 3 and 4 indicates Hybrid III is in better agreement than the ATD 502 with</page><page sequence="13">3280 J.K. FOSTER, ET AL.

However, it should be noted that Hybrid III total weight is 2 kg above the anthropometric goal. This is a result of lower leg and lower arm weights which are too high. Hybrid III and ATD 502 lower arm and leg designs are identical. The ATD 502 total dummy weight is closer to the anthropometric goal because excess limb weight is offset by neck, upper torso, and lower torso weights which are too low. Future dummy development work should address this ex- cess limb weight problem. WHOLE DUMMY REPEATABILITY AND REPRO- DUCIBILITY Repeatability and reproducibility are major considerations in the evaluation of a test dummy design. Repeatability is defined as the similarity of results expected to be obtained in repeated testing of a single dummy under identical condi- tions. Reproducibility is defined as the smallness of variability expected to be obtained between dummies tested under identical conditions. Repeatability and reproducibility, abbreviated R &amp; R, are major factors contributing to the overall accuracy of crash test data due to the Table 3 ~ Segment Weights (kilograms) Segment Des 1 red* ATP 502** Hybr Id 111 *** Head 4.5 4.5 4.5 Neck 1.4 1.2 1.5 Upper Torso 17-3 16.4 17.2 Lower Torso 23.0 18. 3 23.0 Upper Legs (both) 12.2 16.3 12.2 Lower Legs and Feet (both) 8.6 9.1 9.4 Upper Arms (both) 3.9 3.9 4.0 Lower Arms and Hands (both') 3.4 4.5 4.5 Total 7Ü 7ĪI 767J *Anthropomet r lc goals (5) **AT0 502 design values (2) ***Mean values obtained from three Hybrid III dummies Table 4 - Segment Center of Gravity Locations (millimetres) Pes i red" ATP 502** Hybrid III*** Segment X Z X Z X Z Head 152 803 142 803 150 800 Upper Torso 102 457 107 470 102 452 Lower Torso 137 147 130 135 119 1 40 (Refer to Fig. 19) *Anthropomet r 1 c goals (5) **AT0 502 reference values (2) ***Mean value obtained from three Hybrid III dummies</page><page sequence="14">HYBRID III 3281 small sample size constraint of most automotive crash testing. This section compares the R &amp; R performance of Hybrid III and Hybrid II. Measurement of R &amp; R requires repeated or replicated tests on several dummies so that sta- tistical methods can be applied. In this test series, three Hybrid III and three Hybrid II dummies were tested a minimum of six times each in a special hard seat fixture on the Hyge sled. Dummy accel- eration and chest deflection measurements were used to calculate various measures of dummy responses. Repeatability and reproducibility were determined for five parameters: head HIC I, head SI, chest SI, chest maximum deflection, and pelvic SI. Chest deflection data were only available with Hybrid III. A hard seat sled fixture, which is described in detail in Ref. 2, was used for all tests. Basic- ally, this fixture was a padded, rigid seating struc- ture as shown in Fig. 20. The seat pan was angled at 0. 18 radians and covered with a 13-mm thick, 50-durometer rubber pad to provide controlled dummy-to-seat friction. Dummy positioning was performed relative to probes attached to a setup template (Fig. 20). The probes were zeroed to the exact location of the dummy's reference targets prior to the first sled test of each dummy. This procedure enabled all replicate tests on a particular dummy to be performed with similar setup coor- dinates. A three-point lap and shoulder belt restraint system and 15% elongation nylon webbing was used. Belt preloads were adjusted to 44 N prior to each test. Restraint system details are described in Ref. 2. The sled acceleration pulse was a half- sine wave shape with a 33. 8-g peak and a 77-ms duration, resulting in a velocity change of approxi- mately 55 kmA- Overall dummy response data are summarized in Fig. 21. Mean response levels and data ranges are displayed for all replicate tests on three Hybrid III and three Hybrid II dummies. Quantitative measures of R &amp; R are desired for an objective comparison of Hybrid III and Hybrid II. An analysis of variance was used to calculate separate coefficients of variation for repeatability and reproducibility. These coeffi- cients are measures of variability expressed as a percentage of the mean. Repeatability and reproducibility coefficients of variation (CV) are defined below. ~sp" Repeatability: CV = - 100% XG "s" Reproducibility: CV = - 100% _XG_ Fig. 20 - Whole dummy repeatability and repro- ducibility were determined from hard seat sled tests</page><page sequence="15">3282 J- K- FOSTER, ET AL.

Repeatability and reproducibility coefficients of variation for both Hybrid III and Hybrid II are shown in Table 5. These data indicate that Hybrid III and Hybrid n nominally have the same repeat- ability of approximately 4 - 6%. However, Hybrid III shows approximately a two-to-one im- provement in reproducibility over Hybrid II. It should be noted that the three Hybrid nTs were arbitrarily selected from a large group of dummies while all three Hybrid Ill's were prototype units with a very high degree of quality control during fabrication. Inspection of Table 5 also indicates a possible difference in some response levels between Hybrid III and Hybrid II. Fig. 21 graphically displays these response levels. It should be noted that these tests were performed in a special-purpose open test fixture. Response levels obtained in this test environment are not necessarily representative of those which would be measured in actual auto- motive crash tests.

SUMMARY Three prototype Hybrid III dummies have been assembled, and limited testing of the completed units has been performed. Although sufficient quantitative data are not available to rigorously support definitive statements about the dummies' performance, sufficient qualitative information is available to formulate and support the following impressions: 1. Hybrid III component responses are signifi- cantly improved over those of existing dummies when compared to the biomechanical data and corridors which were used as a design base. 2. The repeatability and reproducibility of Hybrid HI, when tested as a whole dummy in a three-point restraint, hard seat environment, is as good as Hybrid II. 3. The anthropometry of Hybrid III is gener- ally consistent with the anthropometric guidelines developed by Hubbard. Although much effort has gone into the produc- tion and limited testing of the Hybrid in prototypes, additional work in several areas should be accom- plished. 1. The documentation package for the dummy should be completed. The final drawings should be checked to ensure that they match the physical structure of the dummy to the smallest detail, and that indicated tolerances are appropriate. Although a complete set of drawings exists and a set of master casting patterns are available, a set of master models for the elastomeric parts should be completed. 2. Additional whole dummy testing in frontal impacts should be performed to generate a suffi- ciently large data base so that quantitative state- ments about performance, with respect to cadavers and volunteers, can be made. Equally important, the lateral response characteristics of components and of the complete dummy should be measured and documented. 3. When biomechanics data become available, they should be utilized to upgrade Hybrid III in several areas; specifically: a. Biomechanics data are being developed with respect to pelvic geometry. The pelvis-leg assembly should be redesigned to have more human- like anthropometry and response characteristics. b. When sufficient volunteer and cadaver lateral response data are available, Hybrid III should be appropriately modified to incorporate these characteristics. REFERENCES 1.
