<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studies on Akhenaten at Thebes. i. A Report on the Work of the Akhenaten Temple Project of the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania* Donald B. Redford The study of the Theban talatat, quarried and first used during Akhenaten' s reign, has reached a stage where a preliminary report is now deemed imperative. The choice of the adjective "preliminary'' is in no way a con- fession of inactivity during half a decade, but simply an indication of the enormity of the task of piecing together the component masonry of Akhenaten's edifices. The photographing and computerizing of some 35,000 talatat at Luxor, the tracking down and photographing (through the diligence of Mr. Ray W. Smith) of scores of talatat in Europe, and the painstaking and often discouraging process of matching blocks into their component scenes are tasks which the Cairo office of the project could have been proud to have accomplished in twice that time. While considerable achievements have already been made, there is good reason to believe that the process of matching individual talatat and partially completed scenes into larger sequences can attain a far greater degree of success in the future. It must not be forgotten that an as yet unknown, but certainly substantial, number of talatat still lie in the Second Pylon, in the east wing of the Ninth Pylon, and perhaps at Luxor; scattered talatat are still visible in many places around the Karnak enclosure.1 Until such time as these are recovered any report on the work of the Akhenaten Temple Project must necessar- ily be incomplete. The matching of talatat into scenes and the statistical analysis of the content of the reliefs, as well as the structural forms reflected by them, has been accomplished through the perseverence and perspicacity of the staff, using their eyes, not a computer. The data, as programmed for the computer, proved too unwieldy to be used in matching; it was found to be expedient to mount contact prints of the photographs (all taken in the same scale) on glass plates for ease of reference. The talatat were categorized on * The Akhenaten Temple Project has been funded by the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, and by the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities, Toronto; the support of both these organizations is gratefully acknowledged. The staff of the Project com- prises the following names: Prof. S. Tawfik, Mr. L. Greener, Mme. A. Shoukry, Mr. S. Goharry, Mrs. J. Goharry, Mme. K. Rizk, Messrs. A. Sanadili and A. Salam, Mile, N. Ay ad, Mr. M.Adib. I should like to tender each of them my sincere thanks and express my admiration for the excellence of their work. 1 I have to thank the sharp-eyed Abdo Tahha, a resident of Karnak, for pointing out to me scores of talatat lurking under bushes and large blocks, and in some foundation courses of standing structures. The Canadian Mission to the shrine of Osiris-Ruler-of- Eternity also found two fragments of talatat, one built into the flooring of the third room, and the second lying loose on a level datable to the period of Nee- tanebo I. For various estimates of the total number recovered from Karnak, see S. Sauneron, Kemi 19 (1969), 154, n. 2. The number 35,000 is an approxima- tion and, as Mrs. Goharry has pointed out to me, represents more precisely the total of decorated faces. 77</page><page sequence="2">78 JARCE X (1973) an ad hoc basis, mainly according to content, rarely according to provenience or present whereabouts, and the matching could then proceed quickly by eye. Two or more blocks which proved to be contiguous were removed from the ' 'classification plate" to a new plate, where the reassembled unit received the quali- fication ' 'Temporary Scene." To date the staff has matched literally thousands of these em- bryonic scenes, which are mostly in a state of constant growth (more rarely, if matches prove wrong, dismemberment). In the six months prior to the time of writing (July, 1972), nearly 200 new scenes have been matched, as well as many additions to old scenes. Just when the period of "short returns" will set in is difficult to say; but certainly it has not yet commenced. In the ongoing study of the Karnak talatat one question which our subconscious constantly poses is: what proportion of the component masonry of Akhenaten's structures at Thebes do our 35,000 talatat represent? Any estimate on the basis of percentage of talatat missing in the temporary scenes matched to date (reckoned on the basis of how many stones would have been in the scene when complete) is bound to be misleading for the simple reason that the matching process has not begun to approach its potential maximum. One factor involved in seeking the answer is the symmetry of decoration evidenced by the direction in which figures face. The symmetry to be expected in the decoration of the walls would lead one to the presupposition that the number of scenes in which figures faced right would be roughly balanced by a similar number in which they faced left. Of 564 certain ex- amples2 of Nefertity's figure or name culled by the writer from both temporary scenes and unmatched blocks, 282 face right and 282 left! In scenes in which her characteristic headdress of disc and feathers is attested, in whole or in part, 67 face left, 63 face right. These figures militate strongly in favour of the conclusion that virtually all wall scenes in which Nefertity appeared are represented in the talatat, at least by one component block. The figures for the king's figure or parts thereof show a slight discrepancy of 38 in favour of scenes which show the king facing left, viz. 179 examples facing left to 141 facing right. The difference is not great enough to shake our conclusion that current returns of talatat are representative of virtually all decorated sur- faces. In any case, the discrepancy might be explained by the fact that the 9th pylon has not yet disgorged all its blocks; it is in the talatat from this pylon that the masonry of the essen- tially regal (as opposed to reginal) temples Tni-mnw and Rwd-tnnw predominate.3 The answer to the question regarding the nature of the buildings Akhenaten erected, whether they formed an integral unit or were scattered throughout the Karnak complex, is yet to be given. The dangers of relying heavily on archaeological evidence are evidenced by the conclusions which have followed in the wake of Chevrier's discovery in East Karnak of colossi and statue heads of Akhenaten.4 Not a few scholars have opted for the broken terrain east of the eastern gate of Nectanebo as the site of the (sic) temple of the Disc at Karnak.5 Yet this arbitrary choice flies in the face of the textual evidence from the Karnak talatat which 2 These figures exclude the pillars. 3 Tni-mnw is treated briefly below, p. 83 ff; Rwd- mnw will be the subject of a separate study which will appear in due course. 4 H.

Unless there is additional evidence suggesting a common location for all of these structures, or some spatial connexion between two or more of them, the prima facie probability rests with those who champion individual locations scattered throughout the Karnak complex.6 In referring to Akhenaten's Theban buildings a danger of being misleading lies in the use of such terms as "Aten Temple of Amenophis IV," "Aten temple of Nefertity," "Jubilee Court- yard/' etc. Nowhere in the talatat is there any mention of temples or structures designated by Egyptian names of which these are the English translations. It is far safer to proceed empirically from an examination of the structures named and to work on from that point. Then we might see that such-and-such a name for a building seems, by the decoration associated with it, to favour the king's figure, titulary, and accoutre- ments over the queen's, or vice versa] that discovery would then prompt a search for the Egyptian name used for the building, rather than a fabrication of an English denominator}7" phrase. Another caveat should caution us against too sanguine a view of the present state of our knowledge of the types of construction, ground plans, and patterns of masonry. We have five possible sources of evidence bearing on these matters: i. excavated remains, 2. the ratio of decorated to undecorated talatat thus far re- covered, 3. analogies at Amarna, 4. walls and other structural features already reconstituted by the process of matching, and 5. pictorial representations in the talatat themselves. Sources labelled 1. and 4. have unfortunately not produced any evidence; controlled, strati- graphic excavation is only in its infancy at Karnak, and, while to date we can boast of short sections or patches of reconstituted wall, we have achieved nothing large enough to betray ground plans. Analogical reasoning on the basis of Amarna layouts might be a more productive avenue of approach; but it obviously has ancillary value only. Amarna offered the open- ness of a wide and virgin site; at Thebes the king had to accomodate his structures to an existing town. The beautiful wall which the Centre Franco-figyptien has so carefully restored shows, in fact, one of Akhenaten's sanctuaries (Tnuntnw) lying between blocks of domestic apartments, not standing in some imagined area free of earlier buildings and set apart from the town. The ratio of decorated to undecorated blocks might be helpful in solving the problem of masonry patterns. Unfortunately at this time the ratios which have been suggested (viz. 3:1 and 3 : 5) rest on no evidence at all, but merely on the recalled impressions of the inspectorate decades after the talatat were recovered. In correspondence M. Chevrier has confessed his inability to produce exact figures on how many undecorated talatat he recovered, but speaks of the repairs on the 2nd and 3rd pylons as well as the Sacred Lake as absorbing "quelques dizaines de milliers." Since the number of decorated blocks approaches 40,000, this could equally support ratios of 3:1, 3:2, 3:3, 3:4 or 3:5; there is just no way of telling. Under these circumstances we must confess total ignorance at this stage, rather than hatch knotty theories on whether external walls were or were not decorated. Methodologically the soundest procedure at the outset would seem to be to examine the pictorial representations in the talatat them- selves of the buildings of which they formed the masonry. This examination is currently in progress, and the results will be communicated in due course. The eight temple names thus far attested are as follows: Gm-pi-itn m pr 'Itn, 'This Disc is in 6 Ninety years ago Bouriant identified the terrain south of the 8th pylon as the site of Akhenaten's "temple'1 (RT 6 [1885], 54), and in this he was fol- lowed by Maspero (Histoire des peuples de V Orient das- sique, II [Paris, 1897], 316 and n. 2).

That being the case, what criteria can be employed to determine to which of the buildings a particular talatat belongs? The first and most obvious criterion can be applied to only those blocks (or scenes) in which temples are mentioned; here the unvarying formula inserts the designation of the structure as an incidental identification of the Disc. Does a talatat, then, on which the Disc is said to "reside in Hwt bnbn/* originate in the Hwt bnbn? An affirmative answer would rest on the pre- supposition that in the wall reliefs in a given shrine only ritual or other activity performed in that shrine would be shown. This seems to be a reasonable inference, and in most cases is pro- bably sound. Yet we do encounter sequences of 7 Rather than "the Disc is found, etc." or "Meeting Aten" (as Badawy, ZAS 87 [1962], 86). The stress here, it seems to me, is not on the nuance of discovery inherent in the verb gmi, but on its common employ- ment as an ancillary verb meaning "to encounter someone or something in a place/in a state/in the act (of doing something);" cf. Gardiner, Egyptian Gram- mar* (London, 1957), § 3I5» 3°4-i; K. Sethe, Das Aegyptische Verbum (Leipzig, 1902), II, § 154, 363, 454b; E. Edel, Altdgyptische Grammatik (Rome, 1955/ 1964), § 585. It approximates most closely the nuance of simple existence often inherent in the Hebrew root MS&gt; : cf . W. Gesenius, F. Buhl, Hebrdisches und ara- mdisches Handworterbuch iiber das Alte Testament (Leipzig, 1921), 45of. 8 Gm(t)~p*-yItn, being ubiquitous, has been omitted. As Fakhry observed long ago, it is a term applying to a larger whole and encompassing several related struc- tures: ASAE 35 (1935), 37. To judge by its appear- ance in the talatat, it included the shrines, daises, kiosks, and courtyards related to the sed festival, the Palace and window of appearance, a structure called the hwt-bnbn, the Nefertity pillars, and the Sh-n-yItn. The vague designation "the House of the Disc" has also not been considered for purposes of tabulation, as it appears to be only a general designation of the temple estate. In the talatat texts it is often qualified as being in 'Iwnw SmKwt "Southern Heliopolis" (i.e. Thebes, cf. Kees, Orientalia 18 [1949], 434f.)» never in *Ipt swt (pace Helck, Urk. IV, 1995, whose restoration of the traces proves to be incorrect). 9 The totals given here are the result of the four searches made by the author through all the photo- graphs of the talatat possessed by the Project. Some isolated examples may have escaped his eye; others may still be concealed in the inferior photographs the Project has occasionally been obliged to work with. But he is convinced that such additions to the list will be very few. Unfortunately three-quarters of the contents of storehouse 09 were not made available to him, and the likelihood is therefore great that the totals for Tni-mnw and Rwd-mnw will be increased.</page><page sequence="5">STUDIES ON AKHENATEN AT THEBES 8l tableaux, especially relating to the Jubilee rites, in which the royal party is shown proceeding from one building to another. Even if one of the buildings, either the point of departure or the destination, were the provenience of the relief scene, the other would surely be located some distance away. On two blocks the structure named is "the northern Maru of the Disc in the Island of the Disc in Akhetaten."10 Did these stones, then, originally come from Amarna, where they once had stood in the aforementioned maru} Surely at this point the validity of the criterion is suspect. The following seems to be a reasonable "rule of thumb" to employ towards the solution of the problem : in all cases where the Disc is said to be resident in such-and-such a temple the building shown in the relief is the temple in question. In the majority of cases the scene will once have adorned the walls of that temple; and only in scenes involving sequence of acts may the temple named not be the provenience of the relief. But the latter possibility will have to be weighed very carefully in the light of all the relevant evidence.11 At the present stage of the investigation even casual observation discloses that the distribution of blocks in the various loci about ancient Thebes, viz. the 2nd pylon, the Hypo- style and the 9th pylon of Karnak, and Luxor, was not haphazard. A definite pattern is emerging. Out of a total of 59 blocks on which the temple Rwd-mnw is mentioned 47 come from either the 9th pylon or Luxor. Out of a total of 20 blocks on which Tni-nmw is mentioned 12 come from the 9th pylon or Luxor. Conversely, 45 of the 56 talatat on which Hwt-bnbn occurs come from the 2nd pylon or Hypostyle, and five of the six references to the Sh n yItn emanate from the same area. Blocks of the scenes which depict the Jubilee come largely from the 2nd pylon and Hypostyle, while scenes of soldiers tend to predominate in the 9th pylon.12 The provenience of stones from construction scenes is again the 2nd pylon and Hypostyle, but talatat from chariot scenes are fairly evenly divided between the 9th pylon and Hypostyle.13 The scenes in which Nefertity is shown by herself come to a large extent from the 2nd pylon and Hypostyle; in fact, 73% of all the blocks on which she is figured come from that locus. In the 9th pylon blocks, on the other hand, she plays a decidedly smaller role. Not only the distribution by content of decoration, but also the position of talatat in pylons or foundations reveals a definite pattern. It is becoming apparent through the careful work done in the removal of talatat from the 9th pylon by the Centre Franco-Egyptien that blocks from a single scene, though not necessarily contiguous, were placed in their secondary locus fairly close together.14 The bearing this fact has on the original site (or sites) of Akhenaten's buildings, whence Haremhab removed the blocks, should not be lost sight of. If the temples were far removed from the Hypostyle or the 9th pylon, what would have been the most probable condition of transportation? First of all, the great distance would have made it 10 See pl. 3.5,7; cf. Doresse, Orientalia 24 (1955), I3°- One immediately thinks of the so-called north palace at Amarna, which has been suggested to be "a counter- part to the Maru-aten" on the south: Badawy, op. cit., 92. 11 For example, it seems ludicrous to suppose that two small talatat would subsequently be shipped from Amarna to Thebes. One might conclude that the two mentioned in the preceding note originally formed part of a relief at Karnak, which, for some reason, depicted a building at Amarna. 12 In scenes matched to date, 97 blocks emanate from the 9th pylon, 32 from the 2nd pylon. 13 There is a slight balance in favour of the 2nd pylon: 182 blocks as opposed to 129 from the 9th pylon. 14 Cf. S. Sauneron, R. Saad, Kemi 19, 137ft. ; in pl. VIII a "near match" is visible in the blocks as they lie in situl Occasional remarks in Chevrier's reports indicate that the same proximity of contiguous talatat could have been detected in the 2nd pylon: A SA E 46 (1947), 155; 53 (1955), 31 ff., pl. X, XI, XIII. A photo- graph by Pillet of the blocks used in the foundations of the north-western part of the Hypostyle, also in situ, suggests a similar contiguity there: Melanges Mariette, p. 82, fig. 1 (See further Pillet's observations on p. 93.).</page><page sequence="6">82 JARCE X (1973) inexpedient for the men who dismantled the old site to be the same that deposited the talatat in their new location. Secondly, in all probability, as the wreckers pursued their task of dismantling walls and pylons, the individual blocks would have been laid in piles awaiting transport. Once at the site of the 9th pylon and Hypostyle some temporary piling might have preceded the laying of the blocks in their new beds. The longer the distances involved, the greater the chance of additional storage of a temporary nature along the way. The more frequent these occasions of temporary storage, the greater the chance that originally contiguous blocks would have reached the new site widely separated. But the fact is that originally con- tiguous blocks are not widely separated, and therefore it seems unlikely that the talatat were transported a great distance to be re-used. In fact, their distribution in their secondary loci strongly suggests that they were taken from Akhenaten's buildings and deposited immedi- ately, and perhaps by the same hands, in the new construction. It follows that the blocks which went into the core of the 9th pylon came from a building which stood close to the site of the 9th pylon; and the same would be true, mutatis mutandis, of the blocks from the 2nd pylon and Hypostyle with respect to those sites.15 Rwd-mnw and Tni-mnw, then, should perhaps be looked for somewhere around the southern end of the north- south axis of the Karnak complex; and the Hwt-bnbn, the Sh n 'Itn, and the related ele- ments of Gm-pi-itn at the western end of the east-west axis. Chevrier's discovery of a large installation east of the eastern gate at Karnak suggests that the king's over-all plan at Karnak differed little from that of his predecessors or successors: he confined his de novo building activity to the extremities of the two major axes. THE ALLEGED REHARAKHTY TEMPLE AND SHRINES AT LUXOR AND MEDAMUD The "Reharakhty temple" poses a difficult question. The allegation that it existed is based solely on the large sandstone blocks which line the road leading from the 10th pylon to the Mut enclosure, on the east side.16 To the writer's knowledge no inscription on these blocks, nor anywhere else in the talatat for that matter, mentions a pr Rc-hr-;hty} or anything else that could give rise to the denomination "Reharakhty temple." Until such a designation comes to light, it would seem wiser to reserve judgment on the identity of the structure involved; it is not impossible that these large blocks represent an early phase of a building later completed in talatat, and masquerading under one of the well- attested names in the list above. The Luxor "At en-temple" is even more illusory.17 In the first place, the present location of the blocks at Luxor provides no prima facie case for their original use there: scholars have long since disabused themselves of the notion that the Hermopolis talatat represent a struc- ture erected by Akhenaten in that city. Homo- geneity of texture or decoration, or indications of "lateness" in the Theban period of the reign similarly are of no use whatever in supporting the theory of a special Aten structure at Luxor. To cite the Hermopolis talatat once more, these too show a certain homogeneity in place of origin (as attested by names of buildings), and were likewise cut and decorated for the most part very late in the Amarna period. But the hypothesis founders in my view on the absence of any name which could possibly be applied to a Luxor building, although all names found in 15 Cf. Hari, op. cit., 323: ". . .ses [Haremhab's] pro- jets de construction. . .exigaient la disparition d'edi- fices. . .qui occupaient T emplacement dont il avait besoin." 16 These blocks, which probably come from the core of the 10th pylon, had already been laid out in their present arrangement early in the present century : cf . G. Jequier, Les temples memphites et thebaines (Paris, 1920), I, pl. 79. They are not a homogeneous group; most date early in the reign of Akhenaten, probably from his first year, but some show later decoration. 17 Cf. the remarks of Fairman in City of Akhenaten III, 192, n. 2.</page><page sequence="7">STUDIES ON AKHENATEN AT THEBES 83 the Karnak talatat occur in varying numbers there. This latter fact lends support to the sug- gestion that Luxor talatat originated in Karnak structures. The presence at Luxor, and rarely at Karnak, of large numbers of talatat re-used and re-decorated by Ramesses II, provides the likeliest explanation of how talatat from Akh- enaten's buildings arrived in the southern location : they were taken there, or to a site not far removed, by Ramesses II for one of his structures. Sometime after the latter was dismantled, the talatat found their way into tertiary use in the domestic quarters of Roman and Christian Luxor. The likelihood of a separate temple dedicated to the Disc at Medamud is extremely remote. In the subject matter of the Medamud talatat there is no single example which cannot be paralleled by the Karnak or Luxor talatat.18 Se^-scenes, offering scenes, chariot scenes, palan- quin bearers, the leading and slaughtering of bulls, feasting, and the storage of food stuffs - all are present at Karnak and Medamud alike. Moreover the execution is done in exactly the same style. In all probability Medamud, like Luxor, received quantities of talatat at a later date from Akhenaten's buildings at Karnak.19 THE TEMPLE TNt-MNW N &gt;ITN {R) NHH This name occurs with certainty some 20 times as a designation of a particular structure among the talatat examined by the Project.20 Like all the formal appelations of buildings at Karnak during this period, Tni-mnw is to be found only in the phrase hry-ib Tni-mnw . . . , a qualification of the Disc. One cannot be sure that here, and in the similar phrase Rwd-mnw, the complete name has been vouchsafed to us; for just as ih-mnw is a shortening of a longer form involving the throne names of Senwosret I and Thutmose III, so the bald epithet Tni-mnw may prove to be an abbreviation. Moreover, the choice of the adjective Tni suggests that some word has been elided, for the quality of distinctiveness must be predicated of someone. Tni, "uplifted, distinguished, distinctive/' usually describes that characteristic of a person or thing which is most easily discernible because of its excellence. So a god might be described as tni mswt-f, "distinguished (in) his birth/'21 tni kdw, "of distinctive form,"22 or tni irw-k, "distinguished (in) your appear- ance/'23 or tni hbw sd, "distinguished in sd- festivals."24 And since the degree is comparative, the entity qualified can be "more distinctive" than another. Thus Amun is tnw irw-f r ntrw, "of more distinctive nature than (other) gods/'25 and Min-Amun is called tni shrw r ntr nb, "of 18 For the Medamud talatat, see Coteville-Giraudet, Rapport sur les fouilles de Mddamoud (Cairo, 1933). 19 The assumption sometimes made that presence of talatat in a certain place militates automatically in favour of a building of Akhenaten in that place, is not entirely justified. One should, it seems, always ask two questions: is there a name for the postulated temple? And does the style and content differ markedly from the talatat at Karnak and Amarna? In answering these questions, the present writer would rule out the possibility of temples to the Disc at Abydos (unpub- lished) andAsyut(S.Gabra,G£E 12 [193 1], 237 ff.), since the talatat from both sites clearly originate at Amarna, and express doubt about the former presence of talatat buildings on the west bank south of Malqata and at Armant. In sum, it seems to me, we know only of temples at Karnak (see the list of names above), Amarna (Fairman, City of Akhenaten III, 198 ff.), Heliopolis (Wts &gt;Itn m &gt;Iwnw: Cairo 34775, L. Habachi, Beitrdge zur dgyptischen Bauforschung und Altertums- kunde, 12 [197 1], 42, fig. 20; pr 'Itn m &gt;Iwnw: City of Akhenaten III, 182, fig. 23; pr yItn m pr Rc: Berlin 20375; cf. also Cairo 34146, Drioton, ASAE 43 [1943], 26, fig. 1), and Memphis (R. Saad, JEA 57 [1971], pl. XXI, lines 2-3; Cairo 34182, 11900, 11984; cf. Hickmann, ASAE 49 [1949], 441, n. 1; 442, fig. 16; Berlin 21597). Other temples may have had offerings instituted for the Disc, but this would not necessitate the construction of special shrines. 20 I am informed by Dr. Sauneron that this figure can be substantially increased by additional occur- rences among the talatat extracted by the Centre Franco-figyptien in recent years from the lower courses of the 9th pylon. 21 Khepry: A.

Tni mnw m *Ipt swt is, in fact, used of Amenophis III ;28 and the conclusion would be a natural one that in the name under investigation Akhenaten is himself qualified. As was argued above, it would seem to be a valid inference that structures and other instal- lations depicted in the scenes in which the Disc is described as "residing in" such-and-such a building are representations of the building in question. That being the case, a close exami- nation of the matched and unmatched blocks in which Tni-mnw occurs might be expected to yield important facts about its layout and con- struction. Thus it seems likely that Tni-mnw had a pylon (see pl. 3.3), and that a central in- stallation was a line of at least three large roof- less kiosks wherein stood rectangular offering tables (pl. 1). Possibly an open court lay adja- cent to the kiosks, shut off from the latter by a lateral wall.29 From another scene (pl. 2) we may postulate the presence of (1) a place where birds were kept,30 (2) an open court, and (3) a bakery and storage area for bread. At least some of the walls of Tni-mnw were decorated with a dado of two or more registers, the lower showing concentric oblong rectangles alterna- ting with papyrus clumps, the upper a line of adoring rekhyet-hir&amp;s (pl. 3.1). The temple is a royal one to the extent that Akhenaten is the celebrant of the cultus therein : Nefertity is depicted only in the first court, and then discreetly behind her husband. In contra- distinction to the rites performed in the series of s£^-kiosks,31 those performed in Tni-mnw re- quired, apart from the king, the presence of only the high-priest of the Disc and the first prophet of the king. The lector priest, ubiqui- tous in s&amp;i-kiosks scenes, is absent from Tni- mnw, at least in the talatat the Project has been able to examine. Gone also are the articles of royal apparel peculiar to the sed: the king in Tni-mnw wears the bag wig and long skirt over apron more frequently, occasionally still the red crown (pl. 3.4). The rites he performs are called "elevating offerings."32 Although in essaying the task of locating Tni- mnw one is entering the field of speculation, certain clues do in fact tend to point in a partic- ular direction. First the vast majority of blocks which contain the name come from the lower levels of the west wing of the 9th pylon, with originally contiguous blocks lying close to one another. If it is a valid rule of thumb that, in the case of the Karnak talatat, locus of second- ary use was also the vicinity of their primary use, then this concentration of Tni-mnw talatat in the 9th pylon is a prima facie argument for locating the structure of that name in the same region. Second, the proximity of a place where fowl were kept to the precincts of Tni-mnw indi- cates a particular quarter of Karnak, viz. the 26 Hassan, op. cit., 164. 27 Cf. Amun: LD III, 236a. 28 RT 13 (1891), 172; cf. also the same epithet used in the Khonsu temple of a 21st Dynasty king: Beleg- stellen zu Wb. V, 375.16. 29 This at least would be a plausible interpretation of the vertical line separating the registers of kiosks from the registers on the left where Akhenaten and Nefertity are shown standing. In all cases the king holds his hands aloft, palms up-turned, and no offering table is shown, a lack of paraphernalia which suggests a court. 30 This appears the most likely interpretation of the superimposed rectangles containing fowl which appear above, and at the left end of, the row of ser- vants. It also is consonant with the fact that some ser- vants are shown carrying birds in cages. For other depictions of places where birds are kept, cf. Kees, ZAS 75 (1939), 85 ft. and pl. IV(b); P. Barguet, Le temple d'Amon-re, pl. XLc (probable). 31 The sed festival rites in the Karnak talatat will be studied by Mrs. J. Goharry in her forthcoming thesis (Liverpool). 32 Fit ht: Wb. I, 573. 11.

Thutmose III, who dug the lake,33 also built an aviary and stocked it with fowl from which quotas were taken for offerings.34 Sety IFs stela, discovered south of the lake,35 apprises us of his rebuilding of the structure, and Ricke is undoubtedly cor- rect in locating it on the site of the ruins of Psamut's ergastulum.36 Finally there is the evi- dence of the name itself. A priori it is altogether likely that, in complexes of buildings, name pat- terns would tend to cling to an area long after the king responsible for formulating the name had passed from the scene. Thus it is of more than passing interest to find a name of the Tni- mnw pattern in south Karnak in the 21st Dynasty, as well as a name of the Rwd-mnw type south of the enclosure in the 18th Dynasty.37 The postulated locations for the two temples which emerge from these considerations exactly fit the ditribution of talatat in the 9th pylon. Tni-mnw, being located in the approximate neighbourhood of the present 9th and 10th pylons was dismantled first, and its masonry used in the lower courses of the new 9th pylon ; Rwd-mnw, on the other hand, being a little farther away on the road to Luxor, was not dis- mantled until the stone from Tni-mnw had been exhausted, and thus its talatat were to be found in the upper courses of the 9th pylon.38 Akhenaten's Construction East of Karnak Slightly less than 100 m. directly east of the Nectanebo gate on the east of Karnak lay the southwest angle of a large court, first detected by Chevrier in 1926. 39 The portion exposed at the end of two seasons comprised the 18 wes- ternmost bases of an east-west line of colossi facing north, their northern edges aligned ex- actly with the east-west axis of the main temple (see pl. 4.1), the southwest corner of the court, and six of the bases running north on the wes- tern side (pl. 4.2). In all cases, the statues had been flung down from their bases, and lay pros- trate, facing out into the court. In the excava- tor's plan,40 a wall runs parallel with the east- west line, 1.70 m. behind (i.e. to the south of) the statues, while to the north of the four wes- ternmost bases in the same row were a parallel row of five "groupements de pierres."41 Unfortunately, the section drawings in both of Chevrier's diagrams do not show the strati- fication of the site even though it is remarkably clear (see pl. 5.1),42 and holds the key to a num- ber of questions. First: are the so-called bases really pedestals for the prostrate colossi, or could they be piers before which the latter stood, reduced to a common level at the time the building was destroyed? The detection in section of a robber trench could have solved this. Second: is the wall south of the east-west line really associated with the statues? True, it is identically aligned, but this is no guarantee ; we may be dealing with a succession of construc- tional phases in which the same orientation was 33 Urk. IV, 175. 34 Urk.

What causes suspicion is the fact that the top of the single course of stones com- prising this wall was encountered 1.70 m. below the level of the "bases." Was it an installation properly belonging to an earlier stratum, or was the wall provided with a trench-built founda- tion? Again only a careful section-drawing would have provided the answer. Third: does the line comprising the five "groupements de pierres" really belong to the period of "bases" and/or the wall? The stones lay at a level 1.20 m. above the level of the "bases," and - more important - above the 15 cm. stratum of chips of sandstone and brick which seems to represent the surface associated with the "bases."43 Chevrier's section does not show the fate of this surface directly above the wall : if it continued uninterrupted, the difference in date between wall and "bases" is virtually proven. It is impossible at this stage to say how large the court was. Conceivably it could have been square, or nearly so, in which case it would have been at least 65 m. on a side. It could, however, have been oblong, with the longer axis running east-west. Again, the north-south line of six statues need not be the side of a court, but a projection of a long east-west fagade. In this case the temple proper will have lain to the south. The precise lay-out and purpose of the struc- ture Chevrier stumbled upon is beyond recovery before further excavations;44 but analogical data may be used to support tentative sugges- tions. Several of the fallen colossi wore double crowns, several the tall feathers of Shu;45 once the red crown is attested. As noted elsewhere,46 in the Karnak talatat the red crown and the double crown predominate in association with (a) Gm-pi-itn and (b) representations of the sed festival. All colossi hold crook and fly -whisk in the customary "Osirian" position, so common in sed-iestival scenes matched to date.47 One of the commonest scenes in the Karnak talatat (to be treated in detail by Mrs. Goharry in her thesis) depicts the king moving between, and offering in, a series of small, roofless kiosks arranged in rows (PI. 1). Clearly these are the sed festival shrines, occupied during earlier or later reigns by the expected welter of gods ; but in this jubilee of Akhenaten the sole occupant of each shrine is the Disc. The king is usually in the sed costume and is accompanied by the high-priest of the Disc in Southern Heliopolis, the chief lector priest, and his own first prophet. The shrines are located in what appears to be a large, open court, surrounded by a curious type of circumvallation. Could the installation in East Karnak be, in fact, this very court? THE LOCATION AND IDENTITY OF THE WSHT Only two blocks mention the wsht, one in con- nexion with Nefertity (pl. 6.3-4). The question raised by this term, unlike the other temple names, has to do with the identity of the builder. There being no other evidence that Akhenaten, at Karnak,48 erected such "broad halls" in his temples, could this have been a standing struc- ture, pressed into service by the new cult? At Karnak, the long columned hall behind the 4th pylon is termed a wsht nt w?dyt\^ and the court of square piers built by Thutmose IV on the 43 ASAE 26 (1926), 104. 44 Even so the prospects appear dismal; in several subsequent campaigns, Chevrier's digging in the same area proved barren: ASAE 37 (1937), X93- 45 Cf. M. H. Abour-Ramman, ASAE 56 (1959), 247. 46 In the forthcoming report on "Akhenaten, Nefertity and the Princesses in the Theban talatat." 47 There are sporadic references to the preparation of royal statues during the Theban period of Akhe- naten' s reign. A Hammamat graffito of year 4 (G. Goyon, Nouvelles inscriptions rupestres du Wadi Ham- mamat [Paris, 1957], pl- 25) refers to the quarrying of bhnw-stone for a "statue of the lord" (Redford, JAOS 83 [1963], 240L); and a talatat in the first storehouse at Karnak (0157-202 15) contains two fragmentary lines of text: m twt nwh;(7) dsr m twt [. . . m twt n i]n[r . . .] m twt n inr [. . .] m [...], "consisting of (?) a statue from a quarried block(?) of red (stone), a statue [. . . a statue of . . .] rstone,1 a statue of [. . .] -stone ..."

They could serve as the venue for a court of law,51 for great gatherings,52 or for reviews,53 for cultic appear- ances,54 or for offerings.55 Their spaciousness made them ideally suited for cultic acts con- nected with the sed festival, and hence it is not surprising to find the nisbe hbyt qualifying wsht.5* The aforementioned pillared hall of Thut- mose IV seems to have been a wsht hbyt to judge from the repertoire of scenes used in its decora- tion,57 as well as the "jubilee formula" which occurs below the scenes on the faces of the pil- lars.58 One wonders whether the wsht of the talatat had also a jubilee use.59 The possibility that Akhenaten made use of a hall already standing at the beginning of his reign raises the tantalizing question of to what extent, if any, the new king made use of the Amun temple and its sat elite shrines. Since it is most probable that his construction activity was not confined to one area removed from the temple, but was scattered throughout the com- plex, a ftritna facie case can be made for con- tinuing free access to the older shrines. Whether the cults for which they were designed flour- ished also in these early years of the new mon- arch is another problem which cannot be solved at the present time. There is some evidence to suggest that Akhenaten was sufficiently con- cerned about scenes in the Theban temples to undertake to modify them by doing something more than merely removing Amun's name.60 This would militate in favour of the view that the temple was still open and being used by sufficient numbers of people to make the king uneasy about what was on display for public consumption. AKHENATEN'S PALACE AT THEBES In "regnal year i" of the new reign "wine of the vine [yard of] Nebmare" was still being sent to the Malqata complex, a fact which might be taken to indicate that the palace was still occu- pied.61 A few months later in year 2, the first month of ftroyet, a clay letter-tablet from the king of Mitanni apprises us that "one was in the Southern City, in the palace of Hcy m ;ht."62 50 For scenes from this temple, see Chevrier, ASAE 51 (1951), 568 ff.; Barguet, Temple d'Amon-re, 95, 308. 51 Cf.

On this formula, see G. Haeny, op. cit., 13 f. 59 In the light of the presence of piers in Thutmose IV's building, a connexion between the wsht and the "Nefertity" pillars is tempting, but a little daring. 60 The evidence in question is a scene in the pillared forehall of the Luxor temple (Porter-Moss, Topograph- ical Bibliography II,2 320, "first antechamber"). Here, on the north wall, east of the door, is a scene showing Amenophis III offering to Amun, with courtiers, priests, and a large palanquin behind him. A long text above the chair has been erased in certain places, and the entire western quarter of the relief has been care- fully removed.

Sealings and scarabs of Tutankhamun and Ankhesen- paaten65 extend the period during which the building was used for domestic occupation into the years immediately following the return from Amarna. While thereafter the palace itself may have suffered abandonment, a settlement bear- ing the name pr yItn thn is attested as late as Ramesside times.66 From this evidence it would seem safe to say that the Malqata complex con- tinued to be occupied throughout the reign of Akhenaten. But was this the only palace used by Akhe- naten during the Theban period of his reign; and in particular is it this structure that is meant by the ch or % wrQ1 mentioned in the talatat? Scenes showing domestic quarters and courtyards with a window of appearance fronted by a colonnade68 are fairly common in the blocks. In one matched scene the king and queen leave such a structure, clearly for some celebration connected with the sed festival, by palanquin, and return by the same means. In others the royal entourage is shown leaving the palace by chariot, again presumably destined for one of the Karnak temples. It could be argued that, as the majority of the scenes in- volved had to do with the jubilee, the standard- ization of the stereotype required by this cere- mony had reduced "the great palace" of the sed festival to a much-reduced mock-up of the royal palace. The palace of the talatat, however, to judge by the detail and elaborateness of its depiction, is no cultic stereotype. Again, con- ceivably, if the palace in question were Malqata, the party would have been shown in an adjoin- ing scene leaving palanquin or chariot and em- barking in ships. But this is unlikely for two reasons. First, scenes showing ships are not very common in the talatat, and none are in the scale required by the chariot- or palanquin-scene mentioned above. Second, departures from Malqata for the east bank would have pro- ceeded by water from the outset, using the wharf and canal.69 For the earlier part of the dynasty, the evi- dence of the inscriptions equivocates on the sub- ject of the precise location of the king's palace at Thebes.70 In the same context it is said of Kamose that he is a "mighty king in Wese," and that "he sits in his palace;"71 but whether Wese in this passage is specifically Karnak72 or merely the Fourth Nome is not clear. Ahmose sits on one occasion m d;dw n pr nsw-bit Nb- phH-rc™ by which a palace on the west bank might be intended; elsewhere he is said to reside in a place called Sdf? Tswy1* which has been plausibly identified with Deir Ballas,75 and again in "Southern Heliopolis."76 The didw n imy-wrt is often mentioned in early 18th dynyast texts as the place where a king gives formal audience ;77 the same ceremony can be described in more general terms as a "royal appearance upon the "year 12," see the writer, History and Chronology of the Egyptian Eighteenth Dynasty (Toronto, 1967), 144 ff. 63 Hayes, op. cit., 176, fig. 33 (S 124); fig. 35 (R 18-20). i 64 Ibid., 37. 65 Ibid., 177, fig. 34 (R 21, 22). ;. 66 A.

On the other hand, one text80 which speaks of a royal sitting in the didw rn imy-wrt1 goes on to describe the king(?) as "resting in the gate which is at the '"northern"1 lake81 of the temple (scil. of Amun)." Should we construe "west" here as relative only to the temple of Amun? That imy-wrt can be so understood is suggested by the Silsileh inscription of Ameno- phis Ill's 36th year, which refers to the build- ing of some monument at Karnak (yIftt-swt), to the west of (imy-wrt) some other structure whose name is not preserved.82 A number of texts make it quite plain that a royal residence stood at Karnak. Thus Ameno- phis II is said to "excercise the kingship of Re in the palace of Karnak (yIj&gt;t-swt)" ;83 and when he has occasion to visit the southern city, Thut- mose IV stays in "the town of Karnak (dmi n 'Ifit-swt)."8* It is only to be expected, more- over, that the principal palace of the king at Thebes would be on the east bank, as that was where the original and most important settle- ment of Thebes lay. The clearest allusion to a residence at Karnak is contained in the unpublished texts from Hat- shepsut's Red Chapel. There it is stated that, when Amun comes from Luxor, he lands at "the western double-door of the broad hall of (the palace called) 'I-am-not-far-from-him* which is on the bank of the river."85 From there he proceeds to the Karnak temple. In the same chapel the palace is mentioned again in the expanded form "the king's palace (called): the Mansion of 'I-Makare-am-not-far-from-him- Amun;'"86 and the entry which immediately precedes is the canal of Amun hnty hn. Taken together with the inscriptional evidence from Thutmose Ill's reign, these texts would seem to prove the existence of a palace between Kar- nak and the Nile, not far from a canal, and perhaps abutting on the north and east on the "northern lake." It is difficult to elicit proof, apart from ftrinia facie probability, that Akhenaten's palace was in the same area. The site on the east of Karnak where Chevrier discovered the colossi might also qualify as a candidate, but this is decidedly less likely. The area to the east of Karnak being behind the main temple in the orientation of the ancients as well as ourselves, it would be strange indeed if the king who wished to stress the omnipotence and universality of the mon- archy should conceal his residence behind a temple, and one belonging to Amun at that. Additional evidence may be cited in support of the theory that Akhenaten's palace lay on the east bank, and probably west of Karnak on the bank of the river. This is the name of a building, H'y m ?ht n yItn m *Iwnw Smhv c;t tpt n(t) yItn, which occurs twice in the talatat so far examined,87 and several times in the texts on the offering stands published some time ago by Dr. Labib Habachi,88 which are dated early in 78 Urk.

It also occurs on the limestone talatat in Cam- bridge (Aldred, Akhenaten, pl. 49), as part of the appellative of the Disc within a kiosk where the king in sed costume is making offering. It scarcely need be pointed out that the building thus designated has nothing to do with Akhetaten, and there are thus no grounds for postulating that the text was added later. It may well be that the three talatat mentioned below in n. 90 preserve texts which similarly once mentioned H cy m ;ht. 88 MDAIK 20 (1965), 70ft</page><page sequence="14">90 JARCE X (1973) the reign.89 The construction of the name strongly suggests the palace, but the addition of the phrase "in Southern Heliopolis, the first great (seat) of the Disc" would seem to indicate a building at Karnak rather than one on the west bank.90 In this connexion, the provenience of the stands may be of some importance : they were found in the earthen ramp laid against the western face of the northern wing of the first pylon, and the probability is that they were found by the workers who raised the ramp in the same general area. This is roughly the place, viz. between Karnak and the Nile, where the evidence considered above would lead us to locate the royal palace. TYPES OF SCENE REPRESENTED BY THE KARNAK TALATAT Ideally the following list would proceed by temple to give the total repertory of scene types used in the decoration of that particular temple. Unfortunately, at the present stage of the in- vestigation, this is not possible. In the study of the content of the scenes we are in medias res : we can see that some genres, by virtue of a common theme, e.g. that of the jubilee, belong together, and were probably adjacent to one another on the walls of a particular building. Others, like the individual offering scenes, are quite isolated and offer no clues on the basis of content as to where they stood originally in the temple. I. Scenes of Offering: (a) Akhenaten offers alone (in Tni-mnw, Rwd-mnw, or in the sed kiosks (pl. 6.1-2). (b) Akhenaten offers with Nefertity standing behind him.

NOTES ON INTENTIONAL ERASURES93 The following are some observations and gen- eral conclusions based upon observations of the pillars of Nefertity,94 and sundry other matched scenes, with regard to the extent and purport of the intentional defacement of names, figures, and objects on the talatat. On the second pillar the hacking of Nef ertity's cartouches is not always thorough and does not seem to involve the epithets above and beneath. On the south side, for example, the four nfr- signs and the ti-sign have been left intact on the right hand side. On the third pillar, the hacking has obliterated the queen's face and headdress on the three like sides, as well as (in two cases, on the east and west sides) the hands of the Disc descending upon the offerings and towards the daughters. Thus the highest point reached by the picks is ca. 2.50 m. above the ground. Signi- ficantly, the parts above this line (i.e. the Disc, its names, and Nefertity's cartouches) have escaped the hacking. Similarly, on the fourth side the vignette at the bottom has suffered most, losing Nefertity's names, the Disc's names and epithets, as well as some portions of the figures. The Disc, however, has not been touched. In the second vignette up from the bottom there are sporadic and ill-placed pick marks upon the figures and the names on the altars. One wonders whether men, working at ground level, found it difficult to accomplish their task effectively at this height. Figures and texts, insofar as they are preserved in the upper vignettes, show only abrasures, not pick marks. On the fifth and tenth pillars, not enough has been matched to show the extent of the hacking, although the upper parts are relatively, if not wholly, free from deliberate defacement. On the north side 91 This interesting scene, of which our matched scenes show at least two examples, apparently depicts a sledge(?) carrying a large bovid quadruped, being hauled by a gang of men under the supervision of two officers . Both subject matter and treatment invite comparison with the famous scene from the Memphite tomb of Horemhab, which comes from the close of the Amarna Period, cf. C. Aldred, New Kingdom Art in Ancient Egypt (London, 195 1), pl. 142. 92 Pictured in W. S. Smith, Interconnections in the Ancient Near East (New Haven and London), fig. 210. 93 See C. F. Nims, JAOS 88 (1968), 545 f. 94 These pillars, of which eleven are in process of being matched with the many unmatched blocks still to find places, come in the main from the 2nd pylon (cf. Chevrier, ASAE 53 [1955], 31 f., pls. X-XIII). As Mr. Greener's reconstruction on pl. 7 shows, three sides had identical decoration, viz. a single scene, in which the queen, accompanied by one daughter (in some few cases two) offered under the long rays of the disc. The fourth, "special," side, probably the one facing the court or whatever architectural feature the piers flanked, displayed four vignettes in each of which Nefertity appeared twice on opposite sides of the table, performing similar offertory rites. The building named in the epithet of the disc is consistently Gm(t)-p t-itn .</page><page sequence="16">92 JARCE X (1973) of the sixth pillar Nefertity has been the object of hacking, but the Disc, msH, and the jar held up have not. The seventh pillar shows, on the three like sides, an attempt, albeit a hasty one, to obliterate the faces of Nefertity and the two daughters, and to erase the queen's crown. Some of the hands of the Disc (specifically those descending towards the human figures) have been similarly treated. Again the hieroglyphic text in the upper part of the scene, beyond the reach of a man at ground level, has been left intact. In general the erasures of names and figures, though intentional, show lack of co-ordination and thoroughness. Therefore it would seem they are not the result of an official directive on any- one's part, or, if they are, that person lacked the authority or the ability to see that his word was carried out. Rather, it seems, the erasures repre- sent sporadic acts of desecration of an unofficial nature, perpetrated by people who disliked the erstwhile royal family and those associated with them. The fact that, in cases which can be checked, the erasures occur on parts of walls and pillars within reach of people standing at ground level, militates in favour of the conclusion that the vandalism took place while the struc- tures were still standing. That the defacement was not more extensive than it is, suggests that a relatively brief period was involved, perhaps on the eve of the dismantling of the buildings. It is dangerous to argue on the basis of what was and what was not hacked out about the ideological motives of the vandals. The Disc and its names seem remarkably free of defacement, but this may be due simply to the fact that in most cases they occupied a part of the wall out of reach of the pick men. The object of the hacking was usually the king's or queen's face, less often their bodies. The careful erasure of wc n in the prenomen of the king in one case sug- gests an aversion to the unique relationship to the god that Akhenaten claimed to enjoy (pl. 3.2). The occasional erasures of priestly or ser- vant figures95 may be a reflection of personal animosity directed against those who were most closely associated with the monarch. Some of the erasures, e.g. the occasional defacement of the anthropomorphic god and the Meret, bull and falcon in the sed scenes, may have been done by Akhenaten himself. Finally, the change of the royal nomen from "Amenophis" to "Akhenaten," an emendation widely represent- ed, though not thoroughly carried out, in the Theban talatat, was surely effected by the king himself, in all probability on the eve of his move to Amarna.98 REUSE OF TALATAT AT THEBES AFTER AKHENATEN'S MOVE TO AMARNA The following royal names, different from those of Akhenaten, Nefertity, and the daugh- ters, are to be found in the talatat from Karnak and Luxor. In some cases (e.g. nos. 1, 4, and 5) the stone is so misshapen that it is not alto- gether certain that we are dealing with talatat, rather than fragments of larger stones. In the case of number 4, the uncertainty is increased upon an examination of one of Pillet's photo- graphs which shows the fragment in question perched atop a neatly packed stack of talatat, with which it contrasts markedly. It seems to have been found subsequent to the arranging of the stack, and wrongly inferred to be a piece of a talatat. 1. Dhwty(?)-ms (pl. 9.2), in vertical car- touche ; crude relief. 2. Mn-[ ]-rc (pl. 9.6), in incised cartouche. 95 Pis. 9.1; 8.5-6 illustrate the defacement of sub- sidiary figures, in this case a charioteer (TS 69), and several priests, including the greatest of seers. 96 That primary decoration of talatat construction at Thebes had not entirely stopped when Akhenaten effected his change of name is indicated by one car- touche on a talatat, now at Luxor, in which "Akhe- naten" is original, and not surcharged. (I am grateful to Dr. C. F. Nims for drawing my attention to this block, and also for directing me to it). The testimony of the Theban talatat as a whole (see further below) is that Akhenaten stopped all work on the talatat struc- tures at Karnak sometime shortly after the appear- ance of his third daughter, and before the introduction of the later name of the disc. Obviously the move to Amarna is the terminus for Akhenaten's construction at Thebes.</page><page sequence="17">STUDIES ON AKHENATEN AT THEBES Q3 3. c;-hprw-rc(pl. 9.4), in incised horizontal cartouche; toponym?97 4.

P-t-l-m-y-s (many examples, especially at Luxor), raised relief. It will be noted that, with the exception of the Ramesside examples, many of the names are in raised relief. Although Akhenaten himself employed incised relief in the main, there are some few examples of his name in fine low relief, which is easily distinguishable from the talatat listed here (see pl. 8.9-10). The date and identity of no. 1 is in doubt. That it is in relief must be noted, as its rather bold, crude style is reminiscent of (though not identical with) no. 4 and no. 13. Nos. 2 and 3 employ the style of cutting of the Akhenaten texts in the talatat. The following conclusions may be drawn on the basis of this evidence : During Akhenaten's reign, after the change of the king's name and sundry lesser erasures, no further construction or decoration was carried out at Karnak in- volving talatat. No examples of the later name of the Disc or its epithets are found on sandstone talatat, and only two examples of three prin- cesses pictured together (as opposed to scores in which one is shown) . On the basis of type of stone, the use of raised relief, and the style of carving, nos. 5 and 6 belong to a small group of talatat, two of which mention the late name of the Disc qualified by the phrase "who resides in the northern maru of the Disc in the Tsland of the Disc' in Akhetaten;" (see pl. 3.5,7); sev- eral others depict chariots in a battle, an Asia- tic (?) city under attack, and contain formulaic, cultic texts mentioning Amun. It would thus seem reasonable to conclude that, under Tut- ankhamun, while Amarna was still occupied and a cult carried on there, limestone talatat were used for some sort of structure at Karnak. It is not improbable that the single fragment with the cartouche of Ay came from the same building. Haremhab's design to pull down the edifices of Akhenaten was preceded by a period during which he effected some decoration of his own. The number of talatat with clearly Rames- side decoration at Luxor proves the former exis- tence of a sizeable structure ; but precisely where it stood is as yet unknown. The decoration is unexceptional : Ramesses II is shown, with his queen, in company with various deities in- cluding Khonsu and Min. In addition there are blocks which contain parts of an "historical" text referring to the Hittites. Nos. 11-13 sug- gest that sufficient talatat remained available for construction purposes at Thebes for well over a millennium after their original quarrying.
