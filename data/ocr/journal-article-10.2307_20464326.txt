<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marlowe's Fable: Hero and Leander and the Rudiments of Eloquence by William P. Weaver M v ) rODERN scholarship on Marlowe's narrative poem Hero and Leander treats it as an exemplar, if not the exemplar, of a liter ary genre in vogue in England in the 1590S that filtered erotic, epic, and mythological themes through the sieves of wit, learning, and rhetoric.' Variously called "minor epic," "short narrative erotic poetry," or simply "Ovidian," the genre describes mythical stories like Shake speare's Venus and Adonis, complaints like Daniel's Rosamond, legends like Drayton's Matilda, and satires like Marston's The Metamorphosis of Pigmalions Image.' Of obvious importance and popularity in late Eliza bethan England, these poems, and Marlowe's seminal contribution in particular, have been relegated in recent decades to the status of curi osities. Even C. S. Lewis, who gave almost unconditional praise to Hero and Leander at the height of its critical importance in the mid twentieth century, called it a "beautiful monstrosity," reflecting modern incom prehension of the poem and foreshadowing its eventual neglect.3 1 Douglas Bush's influential study Mythology and the Renaissance Tradition in English Poetry (1932; repr., New York: Pageant, 1957) was formative in twentieth-century scholar ship of this literature. Bush characterized the mythological tradition of the Elizabethans somewhat narrowly as a reaction against moral and allegorical commentaries on Ovid. See also Hallett Smith, Elizabethan Poetry: A Study in Conventions, Meaning, and Expression (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1952). Scholars have since found more intel lectual depth in this poetry and look to factors other than "Italianate sensualism" to ac count for its popularity. See especially William Keach, Elizabethan Erotic Narratives: Irony and Pathos in the Ovidian Poetry of Shakespeare, Marlowe, and Their Contemporaries (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1977); and Clark H?lse, Metamorphic Verse: The Elizabethan Minor Epic (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1981). 2 The attempt to reduce the prodigious non-dramatic verse of the period to a master genre has led to increasingly abstract definitions of genre, for the poems are notoriously protean in style and subject matter, and the imitations they inspired take a variety of forms. Hulse's apt label "metamorphic verse" is not so much a definition of the genre as a capitulation to its irreducible variety. 3 Lewis, "Hero and Leander," Proceedings of the British Academy 38 (1952): 36.

Weaver 389 The relative neglect and general perplexity that Hero and Leander has inspired are consequences of a critical failure to come to terms with its two most salient features: imitation of classical sources and embel lishment through the techniques of rhetoric. Marlowe's work begins as a translation of a 343-line Greek poem of the same name attributed to Musaeus, the legendary student of Orpheus.4 In a tribute paying homage to the "song" of this archetypal poet, Marlowe refers to his source as "divine Musaeus."5 The force of this reference is not, as has been suggested, its indication of Marlowe's apprenticeship to Musaeus but rather its placement between two major embellishments, each over forty lines long, that Marlowe supplies in his version.6 The tribute is strategically placed to draw attention to the greater abundance of Mar lowe's imitation-its copia, or fullness of discourse, which was a major object of literary imitation in the sixteenth century.7 As T. W. Baldwin describes Marlowe's relationship to his source, "For some time he kept his eye upon the text, in at least one place in the conventional Latin translation of Marcus Musurus; but finally he simply followed the trend of Musaeus, presenting the details freely in his own way and making lengthy insertions of his own."8 In its unfinished form, Marlowe's Hero and Leander is 8i8 lines in heroic couplets, or about three times its source in length.9 To account for this departure from his source, scholars have looked not to specific techniques of amplification but to transcendental liter ary movements or fashions -from the popular (Italianate sensuality, Cantelupe articulated the variously phrased paradox: "The theme, then, is tragic, but the manner is comic" ("Hero and Leander, Marlowe's Tragicomedy of Love," College English 24 [1963]: 298). The playful irony of Marlowe's style has led to much speculation over whether he intended to continue the poem toward its traditional catastrophic ending. See Marion Campbell, "'Desunt Nonnulla': The Construction of Marlowe's Hero and Leander as an Unfinished Poem," English Literary History 51 (1984): 241-68. 4 For a demonstration of this, see T. W Baldwin, "Marlowe's Musaeus," Journal of En glish and Germanic Philology 54 (1955): 478-85. 5 "Amorous Leander, beautiful! and yoong, / (Whose trag?die divine Musaeus soong)," lines 51-52 in the edition of Roma Gill, The Complete Works of Christopher Marlowe, vol. 1, All Ovid's Elegies, Lucan's First Booke, Dido Queene of Carthage, Hero and Leander (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987).

By looking to the textual tradition of his source in sixteenth-century editions, I show that Marlowe's imitational technique in Hero and Leander derives from a grammar school exercise of paraphrasing short narratives. The "source" of his imitation is not an isolated poem but a poem appear ing in a popular edition of literary models designed for the grammar school. My approach to Marlowe's imitation of Musaeus is informed by the history of the book, which has become an urgent scholarly concern in recent years.1' In literary scholarship, the history of the book might be productive in the study of imitation, though it has been largely devoted to the study of reception.'2 The study of imitation is a logical step to follow upon the study of reading; writers are first readers and are in fluenced, to some extent, by the material forms that they encounter. The history of the book, in other words, illuminates the conditions of writing as well as reading.'3 It presents a critical opportunity to revisit and refine theoretical studies of imitation.'4 The two fields are comple 10 See above, note 1.

See also the January 2006 issue (121.1) of PMLA, entitled "Special Topic: The History of the Book and the Idea of Literature." 12 Studies of production tend to focus on the book as an object or commodity. When authorship is the object of study in this field (and the author is an important part of the history of books), the concern has been with the construction of authorship through the medium of print. The argument of constructed authorship, taken up in several re cent treatments of English poets, was pioneered by Anthony Grafton and Lisa Jardine in From Humanism to the Humanities: Education and the Liberal Arts in Fifteenth- and Sixteenth Century Europe (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1986), 122-57.

To interpret sources as material artifacts, conversely, it is necessary to understand the intellectual context in which they are produced. Gordon Braden has studied in impressive detail the reception of Musaeus's Hero and Leander in sixteenth-century criticism and translation.15 His study serves to locate Marlowe's poem at several points in relation to its source but does not locate the source in a historical tradition of imitation. The result is a portrayal of Marlowe's imitation as idiosyncratic: "Marlowe is closer to Mousaios than any other of the Renaissance adapters are, and he is also in many ways closer to Mousaios than he is to any of them."' 6 To understand how Marlowe is writing in or against a tradi tion, and not just emulating a particular author, it is critical to look to the intellectual and material contexts in which his source text appears. In most sixteenth-century editions, the Greek text of Musaeus's Hero and Leander was accompanied by Aesop's fables, two mock epics, the Hippocratic Oath, and a collection of maxims.'7 The first edition of this intriguing compilation, entitled The Fables of Aesop the Phrygian in Greek and Latin with Other Minor Works, was printed in six volumes with con tinuous pagination in Basel by Froben in 1318.18 It was later printed as Brooks, "Gadamer and the Mechanics of Culture," Poetics Today 24 (2003): 673-94.

Braden's thesis that Marlowe was acting inde pendently of vernacular translations has been challenged in an erudite study by Warren Boutcher, who compares the Mercury interlude to contemporary readings of Bosc?n's Leandro ("'Who taught thee Rhetoricke to deceive a maid?': Christopher Marlowe's Hero and Leander, Juan Bosc?n's Leandro, and Renaissance Vernacular Humanism," Comparative Literature 52 [2000]: 11-52). 16 Braden, The Classics and English Renaissance Poetry, 124. 171 have consulted, among other editions, Aesopi Phrygis Tabulae Graece et Latine (Basel, 1541). The contents of this edition are the following: a life of Aesop by Maximus Planudes, Aesop's fables, verse fables attributed to Gabrias, the Homeric The Battle of the Frogs and Mice, Musaeus's Hero and Leander, Agapetus Diaconus's "Exposition of Articles of Ad vice" (a series of Greek maxims addressed to the Roman emperor Justinian I), the Hippo cratic Oath, and The Battle of the Weasel and Mice. 18 Each volume was printed with a separate title page and colophon.

What has Musaeus, highly regarded by many humanists as an Orphic poet, to do with Aesop?20 Froben's edition has a theoretical precedent in a tradition of ancient literary education that taught students to imitate fictional narratives as compositional themes. Influential sixteenth-century humanists, in their emulation of ancient culture, recuperated this group of grammar school exercises, which was called the "rudiments of eloquence" and included animal fables and tragic myths. This humanist tradition is the key to interpreting the coincidence of Musaeus and Aesop in Froben's edition; it also indicates the strategies by which Marlowe imitates Musaeus. The inspiration for Marlowe's Hero and Leander is less sublime than has been imagined, but that makes his accomplishment all the more impressive. He begins his heroic couplets as a rhetorical exercise, and far from limit ing his means of expression, the exercise gives him a powerful vehicle for retelling the well-known tale. Because Marlowe displays his rhe torical technique so transparently, Hero and Leander provides a prime illustration of how the resources and reasons of rhetoric must be our study if we are to appreciate the energy and vitality of English verse of the 1590s. 19 Johann Albert Fabricius, Bibliotheca Graeca, 12 vols. (1790; repr., Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1966), 1:644-45. The editions listed by Fabricius are, by city and date, Basel, 1524, 1530, 1534, 1538,1541, 1547, 1548,1557, 1574/ 15^4/ Paris 1549; Antwerp 1560, 1565, 1567, 1574; and London 1574.1 have not been able to consult copies of all these editions; how ever, Fabricius's list is incomplete. The preface to the 1541 edition refers to "the last edi tion, which was all Greek" (Aesopi Phrygis Fabulae Graece et Latine, sig. a2r). Apparently, the editors ventured a Greek-only edition but found that the Latin translations were essential to the book's success. I have not seen a copy of the all-Greek edition. The Colum bia University Library holds copies of several editions not listed in Fabricius, including a Basel edition with the date 1541 on the title page but 1545 on the colophon. This new edition is augmented with a glossary of Latin translations of the allegorical Greek names in The Battle of the Frogs and Mice. Additional copies at Columbia that are not mentioned by Fabricius were printed in Basel in 1550 and 1558 and in Venice in 1561. The same col lection, minus the life and fables of Aesop, was also printed in a very small 16o format as Gabriae Graeci Fabellae XLIII (n.p., n.d.).

Weaver 393 A FIRST DEFINITION OF FABLE: "PRELIMINARY EXERCISES" FOR THE GRAMMARIAN To understand the sixteenth-century reception of Musaeus's Hero and Leander, we have to begin by considering a first-century labor dispute, for the "rudiments of eloquence" upon which Froben based his 1518 edi tion of The Life and Fables of Aesop the Phrygian were originally defined in a kind of arbitration between two groups of teachers in imperial Rome. In his monumental treatise on education, the Institutio oratoria, Quin tilian covers the responsibilities of grammarians and rhetoricians.21 After treating grammar school instruction in book i, he begins book 2 by complaining about grammarians who take on some of the duties of the rhetoricians. He refuses to speculate whether the grammarians' en croachment is due to their own ambition or to the rhetoricians' neglect; however, he is insistent on on.e point, that when students begin to write narratives, they are to be handed over to the rhetorician: "But if the rhetor does not shirk the first duties of his task, he is needed as soon as the pupil gets to Narratives and short Encomia and Vituperations."22 The narratives and short compositions of praise and blame to which Quintilian refers are the progymnasmata, or "preliminary exercises," an important fixture in the ancient rhetorical curriculum.23 The progymnasmata were eventually standardized as a series of four teen formal prose compositions, designed to wean grammar students from poetry and introduce them to the more practical work of rhetori cal argumentation and persuasion. Quintilian actually distributes the formal exercises between the grammarian and the rhetorician, and his division cuts right through the exercise in narrative: We are told that there are three species of Narrative, apart from the one used in actual Causes. One is Fable (fabula), found in tragedies and poems, and re mote not only from truth but from the appearance of truth. The second is Plot 21 On the two educational professions in Quintilian's time, see R. R.

The third is History (historia), which contains the narration of actual events. We have given poetical Narratives (poeticas) to the grammatici; the rhetor should begin with historical ones (historica), which are more grown-up because they are more real. (2.4.2) The rhetorical definition of "poetical" narratives is a first step toward understanding the imitative theory and practice common to animal fables and poetic myths. Neither one pretends to be a representation of reality. The definition is not just theoretical for Quintilian but supplies a basis for relegating the animal fables and myths to the grammarian's share of the progymnasmata, or the "rudiments of eloquence" (dicendi primordia), which he treats in book i, chapter 9. Quintilian lists several forms appropriate for the grammar school exercise in translation: Ae sopic fable, chreia (moral anecdote), maxim, ethologia (dramatic repre sentation of a character), and poetic myth. Though seemingly diverse, these forms are brought together by a common method of imitation. The definition of a distinct group of grammarian's "rudiments" influ enced the printing of Greek Aesopic fables in the sixteenth century.24 In his 1505, and only, edition of the Greek fables, Aldus Manutius collected a group of forms appropriate for the grammar school rudiments.25 The Vita et Fabellae Aesopi differs from previous editions of the Greek fables because it is an eclectic compilation. Following two fable collections, one in prose attributed to Aesop and one in verse by the Byzantine Ignatius Diaconus (falsely attributed to "Gabrias," i.e., Babrius), there are two treatises on interpreting the Greek myths, a collection of myths refuted with rationalist retellings, a commentary on hieroglyphics, and a collection of proverbs with an explanation of their origin, frequently a mythological narrative.26 Aldus was not, apparently, interested in print 24 Quintilian's influence is also evident in Renaissance adaptations of Aphthonius. In one of the early Renaissance compositions of progymnasmata, Petrus Mosellanus followed Quintilian's definition of the rhetorician's "first exercises." Accordingly, he leaves out myth, chreia, and maxim, saying, "Quintilian does not attach much importance to these" (Mosellanus, De Primis apud Rhetorem Exercitationibus Praeceptiones [Leipzig, 1523], sig. F6r). Quintilian's prohibition of poetic fictions from the school of rhetoric may be re flected in the anti-poetic polemic of Richard Rainolde's 1563 adaptation of Aphthonius, The Foundacion ofRhetorike (1563; repr., New York: Scholars' Facsimiles &amp; Reprints, 1945). 25 Vita et Fabellae Aesopi cum Interpretatione Latina (Venice, 1505). 26 Cornutus's De Natura Deorum (the title given in Aldus's edition) has been translated into English by Robert Stephen Hays, "Lucius Annaeus Cornutus' Epidrome (Introduc tion to the Traditions of Greek Theology): Introduction, Translation, and Notes."

The essay on allegories now called "Heraclitus on Homer" has been edited and translated</page><page sequence="8">William P. Weaver 395 ing the fables as an independent text, regardless of the fact that such editions were successful and would have secured him a quick profit.27 The fables for the grammarian-become-printer were more important as part of a tradition: the rudiments of eloquence, which mitigated the hard work of translation with pleasant materials. Aldus's edition of Aesop is essentially a collection of "fabulae" (in the rhetorical definition of implausible narratives) and their interpreta tions; it closely corresponds to the forms recommended by Quintilian for the grammar school, especially in that it begins with the fables and ends with proverbs.28 Aldus's Aesop was seminal in the Renaissance tra dition of the rudiments, which had wide-ranging effects on poetic prac tice in the sixteenth century.29 With respect to Marlowe's imitation of Musaeus, there is a direct connection. Aldus's edition of Aesop was the source for Froben's 1518 edition, which included Musaeus's Hero and Leander. Froben's Aesop, different in many respects from Aldus's Aesop and more directly influential, exemplifies one of the main practical uses of the fables. A SECOND DEFINITION: THE FABLE AS AN OCCASION OF PARAPHRASE In his division of the progymnasmata between grammarian and rheto rician, Quintilian enumerates for the grammar school several literary genres that appear, at first glance, to have little formal unity. He says, however, that it is not a form that unites them, but a ratio, or "method," of using them for compositions: "In all of these exercises the method is the same, but the form differs" (similis est ratio, forma diversa). He de scribes the method with reference to Aesop's fables: into French by F?lix Buffi?re, All?gories d'Hom?re (Paris: Belles Lettres, 1962). George Boas translated the popular text on hieroglyphics: The Hieroglyphics of Horapollo (New York: Pantheon, 1950). Aldus's collection of proverbs from Zenobius, Plutarch, and the Suda has not been translated. 27 On Aldus's career, see Martin Lowry, The World of Aldus Manutius: Business and Scholarship in Renaissance Venice (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1979). During his stay in Venice, Erasmus drew on the 1505 Aesop for his amplified edition of the Adages, printed by Aldus in 1508. 28 The order derives not from Quintilian but from Aphthonius's Progymnasmata, which was very influential in Latin editions in the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 29 The influence of Quintilian's account of the progymnasmata on humanist education and Elizabethan poetry is the argument of my dissertation, "The Rudiments of Eloquence: Pedagogy and Literary Practice in the English Renaissance" (Ph.D. diss., Columbia Uni versity, 2007).</page><page sequence="9">396 Hero and Leander and the Rudiments of Eloquence Let them learn to tell Aesop's fables, which follow on directly from their nurses' stories, in pure and unpretentious language; then let them achieve the same slender elegance in a written version. Verse they should first break up, then interpret in different words, then make a bolder paraphrase, in which they are allowed to abbreviate and embellish some parts, so long as the poet's meaning is preserved. This task is difficult even for fully trained teachers; any pupil who handles it well will be capable of learning anything. (1.9.2-3) In this passage, Quintilian describes different types of an activity gen erally called "translation" in the Renaissance.30 His description of the "bolder paraphrase" is especially germane to Froben's 1518 Aesop, since it reflects the relationship among the three genres represented there: fables, mock-heroic poems, and maxims. Froben made a more practical refinement of Aldus's 1505 Aesop. From Aldus's textbook, he retained the Greek life and prose fables of Aesop and the verse fables of "Gabrias," as well as Aldus's Latin translation of these. Instead of reproducing Aldus's massive reference book, however, Froben made a smaller compilation of works that the student could handle. This edition, printed in octavo, is not an encyclopedic resource such as Aldus compiled but a more practical handbook of literary ex ercises. Froben's edition contains some works valuable for practice in composition: longer versions of fables. In place of the allegorical and etymological interpretations of myths, it builds on the basic theme of the animal fables by including two mock-heroic narratives, the Homeric The Battle of the Frogs and Mice and The Battle of the Weasel and Mice, which are essentially verse fables puffed up with set pieces in description and declamation. In putting the mock-heroic poems with the fables, Froben may have been inspired or even directed by his associate Erasmus, who claims to have imitated The Battle of the Frogs and Mice in his adage "A dung-beetle hunting an eagle."31 In this adage, Erasmus does not simply recount the fable (as in other adages) but first sets out a detailed description of the antagonists and only then writes an elaborately amplified version of 30 Roger Ascham names six kinds of translation in the second book of The Scholemaster (1570; repr., New York: Da Capo Press, 1968), sig. Lir. 31 Near the beginning of his adage, Erasmus makes an invocation of the muses who in spired Homer to write The Battle of the Frogs and Mice: "But if the Muses, who were not re luctant at one time to dictate to Homer the 'Battle of the Frogs and Mice,' will condescend to leave Helicon for a moment and come to me, I shall try to give a complete account of the matter to the best of my ability" (Collected Works of Erasmus, ed. John N. Grant, trans. Denis L. Drysdall, vol. 35, Adages III vi 1 to IV ii 100 [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2005], 181).</page><page sequence="10">William P. Weaver 397 the story as told by Aesop. In an important acknowledgment of the am plifying exercise he demonstrates in "A dung-beetle hunting an eagle," Erasmus refers to the briefer fable from which it springs, and he twice attributes the fable to Aesop (once on the authority of Lucian, another time on the authority of Aristophanes).32 The Greek fable attributed to Aesop was known to Erasmus (probably through Aldus's Aesop), but instead of relating it in fable form, he references two different citations of the fable in satire and comedy. This allusiveness is a reflection on the "gnomic" quality of the fable, which includes proverbial clarity in its moral but also allegorical potential in its symbolic representation. The fable is essentially portable, and its form, mutable. It can be reduced to a moral statement or expanded in a fuller embellishment. Interestingly, Erasmus made the largest expansion of this adage for the revised edition of the Adages printed in 1515 by Froben, who also printed "A dung-beetle hunting an eagle" separately with "The Sileni of Alcibiades" and "War is sweet to those who have not tried it" in .1517. 33 Erasmus may have advised Froben on the selection of volumes to accompany the 15i8 edition of Aesop's fables. Adapting Aldus's 1505 Aesop, which is a compilation of the poetic forms useful for grammar school paraphrase, Froben focuses the activity to the "bolder para phrase," similar to the one that served Erasmus in his mock-heroic story of the dung-beetle. The conjunction of the fables with the mock-heroic narratives exemplifies two states of a narrative: one in abbreviated form and one amplified by added description and declamation. Aldus's and Froben's editions of Aesop's fables are key texts in the humanist tradition of the rudiments of eloquence, and they both illus trate important features of the school exercises. Aldus's edition, by join ing the animal fables with the tales of anthropomorphic gods, illustrates the rhetorically defined genre of the "poetical" narrative. Froben's edi tion, by juxtaposing animal fables with mock-heroic poems, illustrates the "bolder paraphrase." Froben included in this textbook Musaeus's Hero and Leander, and this edition or one of the dozen sixteenth-century editions based on it was the material context in which Marlowe was most likely to have found it. The formal presentation of this poem among the fables and amplified mock-heroic narratives has an observ able influence on his imitation. 32 Ibid., 180-81,214. 33 Ibid., 178-80111.</page><page sequence="11">398 Hero and Leander and the Rudiments of Eloquence MARLOWE'S PARAPHRASE In his adaptation of Musaeus's poem, Marlowe demonstrates the same strategy found in the mock-heroic amplification of a fable; he uses two formal elements for amplification: description and declamation. He fol lows his source only briefly, using lines from Musaeus to launch into elaborate descriptions of the two protagonists.34 In its structure, Hero and Leander resembles Erasmus's amplified fable, "A dung-beetle hunt ing an eagle," because it opens with descriptions of the characters in nearly symmetrical passages (5-50, 51-90). These descriptions, one of the most distinctive features of Hero and Leander, resemble even more nearly the verse descriptions found in a fable told in Edmund Spenser's "Februarie" eclogue of the Shepheardes Calender (1579). In the fable of the oak and briar, the narrator Thenot begins with a comparative descrip tion of the two characters, who represent wise age and foolish youth. It is useful to see the whole passage, which shows the same kind of detail and symmetry as Marlowe's description of Hero and Leander: There grewe an aged Tree on the greene, A goodly Oake sometime had it bene, With armes full strong and largely displayd, But of their leaves they were disarayde: The bodie bigge, and mightely pight, Throughly rooted, and of wonderous hight: Whilome had bene the King of the field, And mochell mast to the husband did yielde, And with his nuts larded many swine. But now the gray mosse marred his rine, His bared boughes were beaten with stormes, His toppe was bald, and wasted with wormes, His honor decayed, his braunches sere. Hard by his side grewe a bragging brere, Which proudly thrust into Thelement, And seemed to threat the Firmament.

Weaver 399 Thenot does in verse what Erasmus did in prose in "A dung-beetle hunting an eagle"; he amplifies a fable with an opening description of the two protagonists. The descriptions are not static but in motion and summon up past deeds before coming to the present. We get a portrait of the oak in its prime, as well as a georgic scene of a swineherd gather ing acorns from around it. Likewise, the briar is not so much described as placed in a dramatic scene, complete with song. The same features of description have been recognized in the open ing of Hero and Leander, though without an awareness of the genre or exercise from which they spring.36 In the narrator's description of Lean der, for instance, there is as much attention to the responses of others as actual description: His presence made the rudest paisant melt, That in the vast uplandish countrie dwelt, The barbarous Thratian soldier moov'd with nought, Was moov'd with him, and for his favour sought. (79-82) The description of Hero and Leander is perhaps less allegorical than Spenser's description of the oak and briar, and Marlowe draws on di verse traditions, especially mythological allusions and Petrarchan bla zon.37 Within the formal structure of his poem, however, there is a clear debt to the grammar school amplification of the fable. Like Erasmus, Marlowe may have drawn some inspiration from the muses of The Battle of the Frogs and Mice. In fact, the description of He ro's clothing seems to draw on a figurative conceit in the mock-heroic "armorings" of that poem, where the mice are the first to arm them selves: (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1989), 43-44. Subsequent references to "Febru arie" are to this edition and will be cited parenthetically in the text by line number. 36 "Hero is portrayed by the details that the young Apollo courted her for her hair, that Cupid mistook her for his mother, that Nature bestowed on her so much beauty that it depleted the stock and there was none left for half the world. Leander is described as having hair that would have inspired the Grecian youth more than the Golden Fleece, and cheeks and lips that exceeded in beauty those of Narcissus. The purpose here is obviously not to delineate the characters with any realism or verisimilitude; it is to relate them to the whole fabric of myth. The intensification of their beauty is not done directly, for the most part, but by exhibiting its effect upon others" (Smith, Elizabethan Poetry, 81). 37 Marlowe's descriptions, especially of Leander, may be indebted in part to the effic tiones, epideictic descriptions "from head to toe" treated in medieval artes poetriae. See Edmond Faral, Les arts po?tiques du Xlle et du XlIIe si?cle (Paris: Champion, 1924), 129 30, 214-16; and Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, tr. Willard R. Trask (1963; repr., Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1973), 59-60.</page><page sequence="13">400 Hero and Leander and the Rudiments of Eloquence First they fitted on greaves, breaking in half and fashioning well the green bean pods that they had set upon and gnawed during the night. They had corslets from straw-sewn hids that they had made skilfully after skinning a weasel. Their shield was the bossed lid of a lamp; their spear a long needle, bronze work of the War god; and the helmet on their heads the husk of a chickpea.38 The frogs, not to be outdone, are equally ingenious in fashioning their armor: "They covered their shanks in mallow leaves; they had fine cors lets from green mangelwurzels; they fashioned cabbage leaves well into shields; each had a long needle-rush held firm for a spear; and helmets from thin snail shells protected their heads."39 In the description of Hero's footwear, Marlowe plays on a similar conceit: Buskins of shels all silvered, used she, And brancht with blushing corall to the knee; Where sparrowes pearcht, of hollow pearle and gold, Such as the world would woonder to behold; Those with sweet water oft her handmaid fils, Which as shee went would cherupe through the bils. (31-36) Hero's clothing mocks our sense of verisimilitude. Like the frogs and mice going into battle, she wears nature's clothing ingeniously fash ioned, and instead of natural materials being turned to engines of war, they combine in her shoes to make a hydraulic music machine. Though there is no direct borrowing of Homeric words in Marlowe's fantastic description, a common method of amplification is evident. More im portant than this local echo is the opening descriptive comparison of the two protagonists, which resembles the rhetorical amplification of animal fables by Erasmus and Spenser. Appearing as it does at the be ginning of the poem, it is the most important indicator of a generic com mitment in Marlowe's imitation of Musaeus. In addition to amplifying the story with description, Marlowe also adds declamation, which is a key part of the mock-heroic humor of The Battle of the Frogs and Mice. Addition of speeches, especially formal dec lamations, has a long tradition in the grammar school exercise of writ ing animal fables. It is the main method of amplifying fables according to Priscian's Praeexercitamenta, a sixth-century translation of the Pro gymnasmata traditionally attributed to Hermogenes. Priscian's chapter 38 Homeric Hymns, Homeric Apocrypha, Lives of Homer, ed. and tr. Martin L.

Weaver 401 on fables, which was included in Froben's edition of Aesop and in sub sequent editions, explains the method and gives a brief illustration: If you want to write the fables now briefly, and now more fully, how should you do it? For the brief fable, let it be told with simple narration; for the longer, let a speech be made for the characters involved. For example: The monkeys met together, and they were holding council about building a city. Having agreed to build, they were getting ready to dig the foundation when an elder monkey dissuaded them, telling them that they might easily be captured if they walled themselves in. So much for the brief fable. If you want to draw it out, write it like so: The monkeys met together, and they were holding council about build ing a city. One of them took the floor to argue that they ought to have a city. "You see," he said, "that men are happy because they live in cities. They all have their own houses and a forum in common, and they go to the theatres and enjoy spectacles and concerts." In this way, you can draw out the speech in speechi fying, saying then that the yeas carried the vote, and then you can make up a speech for the cautious monkey.40 The sophistical speeches of Leander are an important part of Marlowe's amplification of Musaeus. Leander's long harangue on "Virginitie" (199-294) is declamatory in nature and seems to be in the tradition of artificial speeches like those of the monkeys in council or the frogs and mice in battle. It is crucial to his characterization, for although he seems in the speech very knowing, he is later described by the narrator as a "novice" (497) and as "rude in Love" (545). Leander very much re sembles the stock character of the youth, precocious but inexperienced. He is so sophisticated in his ignorance that he opens his harangue with a formal pretense of sincerity: "My words shall be as spotlesse as my youth, / Full of simplicitie and naked truth" (207-8). The irony is, of course, that he really is simple, despite the seeming artifice of rheto ric. Hero, fortunately, sees through the self-representation of her suitor: "Who taught thee Rhethoricke to deceive a maid? / Aye me, such words as these should I abhor, / And yet I like them for the Orator" (338-40). Able to distinguish between the show of words and the innocent youth who is performing them, Hero appears more savvy than Leander. In contrast to his verbose display of youth, she is quieter but more adept at disguising when she pretends to be indifferent or contrary to his suit (311-12, 489-96, 567-70, 777-78). There are no comparable declamations given to Hero, who plays a de mure votaress and speaks aloud two words, "To Venus," in the first 337 40 Latin text in Aesop, Vita et Fabellae Aesopi cum Interpretatione Latine, sig. A4r.</page><page sequence="15">402 Hero and Leander and the Rudiments of Eloquence lines of the poem. Hero's relative silence fits her priestly, otherworldly role as the object of men's gaze. There is little question that the roles of the two protagonists are determined to some extent by gender con ventions; however, Marlowe's representation also reflects the strategy by which he makes a "bolder paraphrase" of Musaeus.41 He takes the two formal elements of amplification, declamation and description, and divides them between his protagonists. Far from being arbitrary, this division follows from the initial descriptions and anticipates the climax of Marlowe's unfinished poem. It sets in place the circumstances for the unfolding of the narrative, which develops as Hero becomes less obscure and Leander less obtuse. MARLOWE'S FABLE The opening parallel descriptions of Hero and Leander signal the com mitment that the poet makes, at least provisionally, to the fable genre. The descriptions are not ornamental or gratuitous but reflect a rhetorical motive, which is to move the audience to a response, such as praise or blame, belief or disbelief, attraction or repulsion. In the examples of am plified fables by the Homeric poet, Erasmus, and Spenser, the opening description of characters sets in opposition moral qualities: belligerent and peaceful tribes in the frogs and mice, greatness and baseness in the eagle and the dung-beetle, old age and youth in the oak and briar. In a similar way, the symmetrical descriptions at the beginning of Marlowe's poem invite comparison; even the first lines, which Marlowe takes di rectly from Musaeus, introduce the theme of difference: "On Hellespont guiltie of True-loves blood, / In view and opposit two citties stood" (1 2). The iconic setting of the two cities reflects a difference between the two protagonists. Though both Hero and Leander are described by hy perbole, classical allusion, and Petrarchan conceit, there is one striking difference in the way they are described-the narrator describes He ro's clothing but Leander's body.42 The difference corresponds closely to the division of the means of representation that governs the rest of the poem; Leander's naked appearance is to declamation (his "naked truth") as Hero's clothing is to description. The description of Leander's naked body at the beginning of the poem 41 On gender conventions, see David Lee Miller, "The Death of the Modern: Gender and Desire in Marlowe's 'Hero and Leander,'" South Atlantic Quarterly 88 (1989): 757-86. 42 In Elizabethan Erotic Narratives, 88-115, Keach discusses the descriptions and their significance at length.</page><page sequence="16">William P. Weaver 403 is a fitting prologue to his declamation, for the rhetorical speech was supposed to reveal character.43 The self-disclosure implicit in the spo ken word is exemplified by a written exercise of the grammar school: ethopoeia, or impersonation, such as "What words the farmer would say the first time he saw a ship."44 The formal exercise in impersonation is essentially a comic treatment of literary and cultural stereotypes; there is nothing obscure about it. In a similar way, the representation of Lean der through his words depends on a stock character, the "bold sharp sophister," and invites recognition and amusement. Marlowe uses throughout the poem a different technique to represent Hero. Whereas Leander occasions most of the declamation, Hero occa sions most of the description (with the exception of the homoerotic bla zon in lines 51-90). Unlike the portrayal of Leander through his speech on "Virginitie," an iconic tableau characterizes Hero: And in the midst a silver altar stood, There Hero sacrificing turtles blood, Vaild to the ground, vailing her eie-lids close, And modestly they opened as she rose: Thence flew Loves arrow with the golden head, And thus Leander was enamoured. (157-62) Hero's characterization takes place in the context of an ecphrasis, the description of Venus's temple, where the love exploits of the anthropo morphic gods are painted on the floor. These imaginative representa tions are not transparent but dark, violent, and allegorical: a troubling backdrop to the apparent celebration of erotic love in Marlowe's poem. The appearance of Hero in the midst of the erotic scenes tends to in crease the mystery of her character; she is tellingly "veiled," a word em phatically repeated. The image of the veil is a clue to the kind of representation Marlowe employs in his characterization of Hero. The veil was an important metaphor in Renaissance discussions of the "poetic fable."45 Like the 43 Rhetoric, compared figuratively to an open hand in contrast to the closed hand of logic, was generally considered an art of transparency. See Wilbur Samuel Howell, Logic and Rhetoric in England, 1500-1700 (1956; repr., New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1961). 44 Quintilian may refer to this exercise as "ethologia," which is one of the "rudiments of eloquence" discussed in Institutio Oratoria, 1.9. See also Kennedy, Progymnasmata, 84-85. 45 Fabula, or the rhetorical genre of implausible narratives, including both animal fables and mythological tales. See above and also Michael Murrin, The Veil of Allegory: Some Notes Toward a Theory of Allegorical Rhetoric in the English Renaissance (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1969), 3-20,117-31; and Trimpi, Muses of One Mind, 97-116.</page><page sequence="17">404 Hero and Leander and the Rudiments of Eloquence veil, the poetic fable alternately conceals and reveals, depending on the speaker's intention and the audience's interpretive capacity. It is most often defended as a means of representing something unfamiliar, lofty, or beyond the powers of the audience's apprehension. The fable can be used as a means of persuasion or confusion, as in the famous example of Jesus's purpose in speaking in parables, which is related differently by two evangelists.46 Deriving from religious and philosophical forms, the veil demarcates a group of initiates who are not repelled by the ap parent darkness or absurdity of the symbolic image. Leander begins the story as a non-initiate. In a rather catachrestic simile, the narrator, describing Leander kissing Hero, compares him to Aesop's cock, the foolish bird who finds a precious stone in a dungheap and discards it because he cannot appreciate its value: Like Aesops cocke, this jewell he enjoyed, And as a brother with his sister toyed, Supposing nothing else was to be done, Now he her favour and good will had wone. (535-38) "The Cock and the Jewel" was the first fable in the most popular English fable collection of Marlowe's day, Caxton's translation of the twelfth century Latin verse fables of Walter the Englishman (Gualterus Angli CUS).47 The fable was first in the collection because it illustrated how the fables were supposed to be read in the medieval tradition-to appreci ate, unlike the foolish cock, a meaning obscured by a ridiculous narra tive.48 In what appears to be a casual comparison, Marlowe references not only the prime fable of the medieval fable collection (which was popular in vernacular editions across Europe throughout the sixteenth century) but also the moral method of reading fables. It is an important indication of how the characterization of Hero functions in his story, which can be read as a history of Leander "reading" Hero. The representation of Hero depends on a poetical economy of con cealment and disclosure, for the images used to describe her are off putting to the rationalistic reader. Hero is, notoriously, "Venus Nun," 46 See Frank Kermode, The Genesis of Secrecy: On the Interpretation of Narrative (Cam bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1979), 23-47. 47 See Edward Wheatley, Mastering Aesop: Medieval Education, Chaucer, and His Followers (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2000), 3-4,196. 48 The fable, in other words, was a crude representation of scholastic allegoresis. The medieval hermeneutical tradition of the fables was complex, but the interpretation of fables in the Aesopus Moralisatus can be generally defined as allegorical?the meanings of the fable are not intuitive.</page><page sequence="18">William P. Weaver 405 an absurdity that prompts one of Leander's wittiest arguments: "Then shall you most resemble Venus Nun, / When Venus sweet rites are perform'd and done" (319-20). Throughout the first part of the poem, she wears the garments of her unlikely vocation; her priestess's robe is no more plausible than her hydraulic shoes. When she first speaks, she is interrupted by her tears, which occasion another image noted for its absurdity: "and as shee spake, / Foorth from those two tralucent ces ternes brake, / A streame of liquid pearle, which downe her face / Made mild-white paths, whereon the gods might trace / To Joves high court" (295-99). Just when Hero's speech might reveal more of her character, the iconic tears perpetuate her veiled representation. In his description of Hero by the distortional devices of hyperbole, allusion, and irony, Marlowe portrays love as something mind altering. Early in the poem, the narrator alerts the reader to the various effects of the images through which Hero is represented: "Her vaile was arti ficiall flowers and leaves, / Whose workmanship both man and beast deceaves" (19-20). She has sinister effects on those who view her: But far above the loveliest, Hero shin'd, And stole away th'inchaunted gazers mind, For like Sea-nimphs inveigling harmony, So was her beautie to the standers by. (103-6) The comparison to the Sirens reiterates the fabulous means that Mar lowe exploits to portray Hero. She not only deceives but also enchants, infuriates, and surprises, and she is the occasion of life, death, and poetry. Interestingly, all of these effects were attributed to "fables."49 In Plato's famous critique of the poetic image, one of the dangers that poetry poses to philosophy is the distortion of perception.50 Renaissance humanists, however, found cognitive distortion to be beneficially ap propriate for the undeveloped mind. Philip Melanchthon, Professor of Greek at Wittenberg from 1518 until his death in 1560, defends the use of poetic fables because of their distortion of truth, which makes them a suitable preparation for philosophy: "There is altogether nothing more beautiful and pleasant than the truth, but it is too far removed from the 49 Most famously in Plato's Ion. See also Plutarch's essay on the pedagogical uses of poetry, How The Young Man Should Study Poetry, in Plutarch's Moralia, ed. and trans. Frank Cole Babbitt, 14 vols. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1927) 1:87-91. 50 The essentials of Plato's objection to poetry on cognitive grounds are found in Repub lic, 6o2a-6o3c. For Aristotle's response to Plato's criticism of the poetic image, see Trimpi, Muses of One Mind, 59-63.</page><page sequence="19">406 Hero and Leander and the Rudiments of Eloquence sight and the eyes of men for it to be beheld and known fortuitously."51 The solution is to lead to the truth by enticement, gradually, and the fables accomplish this by inducing wonder: "tales which first rouse by wonder the children's minds that are sleeping as if in lethargy."52 Re naissance theorists thus imagined the poetic image as a distortion of reality that accommodated human development.53 The psychological usefulness of the fable in Renaissance education is paralleled in the emerging relationship between Hero and Leander. The poem, which begins with a fully clothed Hero, ends with Leander gazing on Hero's nakedness: So Heroes ruddie cheeke, Hero betrayd, And her all naked to his sight displayd. Whence his admiring eyes more pleasure tooke, Than Dis, on heapes of gold fixing his looke. (807-0o) This is the final image of the lovers and occurs at the effective ending of the poem at sunrise. In a way, the action of Hero and Leander, introduced with the comparative description of the two protagonists, one clothed and the other naked, is the unveiling of Hero. In the unveiling scene, the narrator even pauses midway in Hero's exposure to compare her to a mermaid: "One halfe appear'd the other halfe was hid" (8oo). The image of the fantastic sea creature resonates with the fictional genre in which Hero and Leander participates: the fables of anthropomorphic gods and animals, which were imagined or justified as ways of repre senting philosophical truth to the limited cognitive powers of humans. The coincidence of Hero's total unveiling with sunrise may be Mar 51 Melanchthon, Orations on Philosophy and Education, ed. and tr.

Weaver 407 lowe's play on the poetic image as a preparation for philosophy. In the metaphor of knowledge as vision, philosophy was imagined as the full light of the sun, which is blinding to all but the initiate. The use of poetry to mitigate or "reflect" the blinding light of philosophy is elo quently expressed by Plutarch: But when [children] hear the precepts of the philosophers . . ., at first aston ishment and confusion and amazement take hold of them, since they cannot accept or tolerate any such teaching, unless, just as if they were now to look on the sun after having been in utter darkness, they have been made accustomed, in a reflected light, as it were, in which the dazzling rays of truth are softened by combining truth with fable[.]54 Leander does not perceive the fullness of Hero's beauty in his early encounters, yet he is enticed until he sees her finally unveiled. At the beginning he is a simple, uninitiated, and naked youth; over the course of the story, he is drawn into the knowledge of erotic love. In Hero and Leander, the representational veiling of Hero is a fortu nate condition of Leander's coming of age. Marlowe turns the conven tional moral economy of the fable to an aesthetic use-the veiling of Hero in metaphor and hyperbole enchants Leander until he can behold her naked "truth." Early in the poem, the young boy's confident perfor mance of declamation despite his lack of knowledge is his natural re sponse to his astonishment at seeing Hero. He can declaim twenty-one heroic couplets on the theme of virginity as a jewel with apparent igno rance of Hero's "jewel." Leander's precocious eloquence is, in a way, emblematic of the poet's attempt to use words to describe erotic love, for such an attempt inevitably exposes the language's and the poet's limitations. For the poet, the fictional veil is a useful arbiter between representation and reality, mediating with enigma, obscurity, and ab surdity the mysteries of erotic love. If it retains any of the evaluative function of the fable structure with which it begins, Hero and Leander in vites a psychological or aesthetic, not a moral, evaluation: what is more effective in stimulating desire, the directness of Leander's "naked" speech or the indirectness of Hero's "veiled" image? CONCLUSION In one of the many fascinating figures he uses to describe Hero and Leander's first sexual encounter, Marlowe compares them with Venus 54 Plutarch's Moralia, ed. Babbitt, 1:195.</page><page sequence="21">408 Hero and Leander and the Rudiments of Eloquence and Mars, whose illicit love was the subject of a graphic description by Lucretius, the Epicurean philosopher of the late Roman Republic. By 1588, when Michel de Montaigne published a revised and expanded edition of his Essays, the Lucretian passage had taken an important place in Renaissance theory of imitation. In book 3, chapter 5, "On Some Lines of Virgil," Montaigne compares the Lucretian passage with Virgil's description of Venus and her husband Vulcan's chaste love. In a subtle comparison, he describes the direct, sensual method of Lucretius as more to his stylistic liking but admits that the indirect, suggestive method of Virgil is more psychologically stimulating. Marlowe exploits both methods in his amplification of Musaeus's Hero and Leander, and it is the fable genre that accommodates the techniques through which he exposes the underlying psychology of literary imitation. Marlowe was not just versed, then, but deeply interested in the types of eloquence practiced in the Elizabethan grammar schools. The rhe torical practices and literary forms of the English Renaissance were not independent of the production and circulation of texts, and so the study of books as artifacts is crucial to appreciating how different forms were appropriated for various uses and practices. In some cases, as in Mar lowe's imitation of Musaeus, the material book as a context is indispens able for understanding the theoretical genre of a work. Studies of books as artifacts have tended to focus on the life of texts after or independent of authors, but the material fortunes of literature do not militate against the study of the author's role in the production of texts. On the contrary, material forms mediate authors' reception of works and provide evi dence of the historical conditions of their imitations. Baylor University</page></plain_text>
