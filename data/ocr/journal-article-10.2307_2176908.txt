<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PSYCHOLOGICAL NATURE OF CAUSALITY. QINCE Hume's attempt to make a purely psychological anal- ysis of the nature and conditions of the origin of the feeling of causality, there seems to have been little desire to trace em- pirically the marks that serve to distinguish the causal connection of two mental processes from mere temporal succession. It seems, then, that it may be worth while to attack Hume's problem in his own spirit. The advances in psychology since his day should certainly throw new light on the problem and enable us to go farther than he did, even if we work in the same way. Hume's answer to the question, it will be remembered, was that all depended upon the frequency and strength of the con- nection between the two events,- that mere succession frequently repeated under varying conditions serves to connect the two events so closely that we say one is the cause of the other and always think them together. That the explanation is insufficient has been demonstrated repeatedly. The two considerations that have been most frequently adduced against it are (i) that we have many pairs of events that succeed each other frequently which we do not regard as causal, as, e. g., the succession of day and night, or the customary relations that have grown up between a given day and an event, as eating fish on Friday, and (2) that there are many pairs of events that are regarded as causally con- nected when they occur for the first time. These together suffice to mark Hume's answer to the question as at least incomplete. If we attempt to attack the problem for ourselves, bearing in mind Hume's actual achievements, it is seen at once that the problem divides itself into two parts, corresponding to the now familiar classification into structure and function. From the first point of view, our problem is: What are the characteristics of the two members of the conscious stream, or of their relation, which serve to mark them as causally connected? This is merely a problem in the introspective analysis of a conscious state. From the second and more important standpoint, we must ask: What are the conditions that cause these characteristics to attach to the two 409</page><page sequence="2">410 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. events in question and serve to mark them as peculiarly related and not as merely successive ? It is easier to answer the first question than the second, but even here there is undoubtedly room for dispute as to many of the elements involved. In the writer's consciousness the sign of the causal relation takes on a distinctively anthropomorphic form. There is invariably a marked attribution of strain sensations to the object, which is represented as active, and just as distinct pas- sivity ascribed to the object that is considered the effect. With the ascription of the effort to the causing event, there also go actual contractions of the muscles of the body that would be in- volved in accomplishing some purpose. The feeling of effort is not altogether a memory image, but is an actual sensation from real though vain contractions. Nor is this a fact peculiar to the writer. If you will watch any group of men who are discussing the problem of energy in any of its forms, you will notice that, as a man asserts the existence of a real cause, there is often a violent gesture, an added force to the expression of the word, and in many cases an apparent preparation to accomplish the thing that he asserts his cause can do. If you will picture to yourself the relation between the sun and the earth, you will find that you ascribe to the sun very much the same consciousness that you would have, if you were trying to hold a large dog as he circled around you at the end of a rope. Even if we try to think force in the abstract, it is very difficult to obtain a concept that will not be accompanied by this human or animate element. When you picture to yourself any simple form of physical causa- tion, any manifestation of energy, as cohesion, electrical potential, sound waves, or light, and think of them as actually effective, the strain sensations seem bound to enter. One who is not very highly trained in abstract thought and very familiar with me- chanical ways of thought, can hardly think two particles of matter as influencing each other without picturing some small force concealed in them somewhere or somehow. If you can get him to describe the actual mental imagery that he uses in representing this force to himself, you will find in practically every case that the strain sensations constitute its kernel, if they do not compose it entirely.</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] PSYCROLOGICAL NASTURE OF CAUSALITY. 4II The words of mechanics are all merely transferred from an original human application. Force, strain, stress, energy, work, tension, are all of anthropomorphic origin. The human origin is even now but thinly veiled behind the impersonality that should have complete sway after centuries of technical use. But the metaphor seems to lie deeper than the word, and so is kept alive by the mental pictures that invariably come up as the words are spoken. In brief, then, the one object or event seems to us to be the cause, the other the effect, when we think of the two as related in the same way as our members are related to the weight that we would lift; while, when this active element is lack- ing and we picture them as standing to each other as our bodies on a grassy bank to the swallows flying above us, we regard the events as merely successive. So close is the connection between our own feeling of activity and the idea of cause in the writer's personal experience that it has frequently been noticed when registering some rhythmic process, after the registration movement has become almost reflex, that the movement seems to be the cause of the change that is recorded, not a response to it. If we are able to regard the sensations of strain that are ascribed to one process as the sign that it is the cause of the event that succeeds it, the more important of the two partial problems still remains to be solved: What is it that determines when the sign is to attach ? It might seem that this problem be- longs to some other science than psychology,- either to episte- mology, logic, or methodology. This must be admitted as regards some of the aspects of the problem, and that it be- longs in part to the different sciences that are concerned with the concrete cases of connection as well; but, in addition, it must be asserted that there are definite conscious conditions that favor its entrance, and these it is the business of psychology to deal with. It is absurd to assume that psychology may with propriety consider the conditions of sensation, of perception, of feeling and action, but has absolutely nothing to say concerning reason or belief or causality. It may be true that the latter problems can</page><page sequence="4">412 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. only find their final explanation in logic or epistemology, it may even be that their most important phase is logical; but it is also true that they are phenomena which take place in the same mind as that with which we feel and remember, and that consequently they have a psychological aspect that must be considered, if psychology is to be a complete science of mind. Perhaps the simplest way of approaching the matter is to con- sider the arguments pro and con for some case of disputed cau- sality. One of the best instances that can be found on the bor- der-land of science is as to the existence of telepathy. Here we have bandied to and fro the question as to whether the existence of the same or approximately the same idea in two minds at the same time is or is not to be explained on the assumption that the one idea is the cause of the other. Three tests of the existence of the causal relation are used by the different parties in the con- troversy, the number of instances -too frequently the number of positive cases with no reference to the number of negative- the proportion of positive to negative as compared with the ratio that would be expected were there no causal relation, and the degree to which the relation can be made to harmonize with the remainder of our knowledge. That the first factor alone is not sufficient to make us regard two events as causal is shown by the immediate reference to the law of probability, practically a more refined application of the criterion of frequency of connection. We cannot, of course, go into a discussion of the mathematical intricacies here, but may satisfy ourselves with noting that, in cases of disputed interpreta- tion, and in some cases where the probabilities would indicate a causal relation, there is an appeal to the harmony of the particu- lar connection with experience as a whole. In the instance in hand, the question of excess of coincidences over the probable chance relations is very much in dispute. Each man who dis- cusses the census of hallucinations adopts a different method for calculating the probabilities, and for all other phenomena that have been adduced the material is too complicated to warrant any attempt at mathematical interpretation and we are left with a mere series of uninterpreted cases.</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.] PSYCHOLOGICAL NA TURE OF CA USALITY. 4I3 The lacking element is supplied, or an attempt is made to sup- ply it, by pointing to analogous cases of connections that are gen- erally recognized as causal. In the case in question, it is said that two minds are related as the transmitter and receiver of the wire- less telegraphy apparatus. Everyone would regard this method of proof as in a large measure satisfactory, were it only possible to indicate in the brain or in some mental process anything that could easily be regarded as similar in function to trasmitter and coherer, or to anything else that has been known to propagate electrical waves to a distance. Those who do believe in terms of the analogy must simply overlook the differences between the two functions or mechanisms, and keep in mind the similarities alone. Even the result of the calculation of probabilities that is made by the different protagonists is undoubtedly influenced in these doubtful cases by the way in which the analogies appeal to the computer. One predisposed to belief is very likely to decide that some method which reaches the desired result is the correct one, and will be blind to its deficiencies. And if the calculation of probabilities is accepted as entirely favorable to the causal connection between the two mental states that occur simul- taneously, one who cannot harmonize the belief with what he knows in other relations will regard their coincidence as merely a curious fact, and will not believe that there is any deeper lying connection between them. It is harmony with experience as a whole that leads us to assume causality, not mere counting of instances, or calculation of probabilities. The influence of the elements of experience other than the two processes actually concerned is made even more clear, if we com- pare the almost universal and immediate belief in the Hertz waves and their applications with the general skepticism toward telepathy. In the early stages the number of cases of simultaneous connection was not so very different,-the differences lay entirely or very largely in the fact that everything we knew of electrical phenomena agreed with the assumption of causal relation in the former case and much of experience was at variance with the assumption in the latter. The same general law seems to hold in every realm of science and every-day life. We feel more assured of the causal relation</page><page sequence="6">4I4 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. between a radiant source and the illumination of neighboring sur- faces, when we picture the molecules of the source as in rapid vibration and waves streaming out with each oscillation. The added certainty comes from the fact that the picture brings the new phenomenon into connection with the very familiar means of pro- ducing waves on the surface of the water or with the methods of producing sounds. Most of the other theories of science could be shown to consist essentially in a reduction of some one phenomenon to another form which was more familiar. Each accepted causal connection is made to support another, as well as to receive support from those already believed in. From this standpoint, causality would seem to be a process of mutual sup- port which exists between the analogous relations of knowledge. In every-day life, particularly among the uncivilized peoples, a much more remote analogy will serve to arouse belief in a cau- sal connection. This is perhaps best seen in the many curative rites of savages. It is believed that recovery from disease of an organ has occurred because a part of that organ from an animal has been eaten or burned. Even if the analogy will not with- stand rigid examination, it fulfills its purpose for the uncritical. We may sum up the conditions of origin of the causality feel- ings so far as they are conscious, then, in the two considerations of the frequency of occurrence, or more strictly in the number of connections in relation to the number of occurrences of the first, and secondly, in the degree in which this particular connection can be made to harmonize with our experience as a whole. Much more frequently than otherwise, however, there is no con- scious tracing of analogies, but the harmony with experience as a whole works unconsciously to give the feeling of causality. We do not stop to think each time of the similarities which exist between the new and the old connections, but they nevertheless work unconsciously. We do not need to delay our decision as to the reality of the connection between the shape of the moon and the state of the weather while we analyze the two facts into their elements or search for analogies. We are content with the simple statement of disbelief. But this statement rests upon very much the same set of conditions, working unconsciously, that</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.] PSYCHOLOGICAL NA TURE OF CAUSALITY 415 were consciously at work in the preceding case. The connection considered is either in harmony with what we have known before or is not in harmony with it. In the one case we are ready to accept the particular connection as causal, and in the other we affirm there is only a chance coincidence. But there is in neither an actual presence in consciousness of the related experiences. The only sign that we have of their action is in the attribution of strain sensations in one case and the absence of strain sensations in the other. The decision comes up without any fore-knowl- edge that the decision was to be made. The process is never- theless one in which the sum total of previous knowledge is at work in reinforcing the final conclusion. The best evidence for this statement is to be found in the way that what appears a causal relation varies with the experi- ence of the individual. Tell a child that the morning milk was soured by the pixies, who exchanged old milk for fresh, and it will at once accept the explanation. An educated adult may scoff at the statement but believe that the electrical phenomena accompanying a thunderstorm are responsible, while the physical chemist will question this explanation also. The difference is due entirely to the knowledge that each has. Ascribe the fail- ure of a crop to the fact that the seed was planted during the waning of the moon, and the country bumpkin will consider it as adequate without consideration of any kind, while his neighbor of more education will refuse to believe with just as little hesita- tion and just as little apparent reason. In both these cases we must assume that the deciding motive is the past experience of the individual, his knowledge of similar and related facts, but that these work immediately to support or reject the causal relation, and that we are not conscious of them but merely of their effect. It is a process of physiological reinforcement between the dif- ferent nerve cells rather than a conscious and reasoned decision in terms of one interpretation or another. In this case it seems that we have reached a conclusion not very different from Bosanquet's when he makes causality depend upon the reception of the par- ticular relationship into a system of knowledge, or into the world of meanings, except that the system arises from the organization</page><page sequence="8">4-6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. of the individual's knowledge, and is in no sense a supra-mental process. In short, then; the anthropomorphic feeling of strain, which constitutes an essential element of the sign of causality, will be called up by the first of two succeeding events, when they have occurred together frequently, and when all other experiences serve to confirm the assumption that they cannot exist apart. While each of these factors plays a part, it can, I think, be said that the last contributes most. The closeness or frequency of connection usually furnishes the occasion for the belief in a causal relation, and the more frequent it is, the more likely are we to raise the question; but frequency of connection alone will never satisfy us. Even if we should put the matter on a scientific basis, and find that there is always a quantitative relation between the variations of the two elements, we would not ordinarily be led beyond the state- ment that it was a curious coincidence, unless the relation in question could be articulated, consciously or unconsciously, with the great mass of our experience. The causal relation is merely affirmed to be possible on the basis of coincidence or succession; it is asserted only when it can be assimilated to the body of knowledge already acquired. If this analysis of the psychological nature of the causal rela- tion is accepted provisionally, it may be interesting to attempt to apply the conclusions reached to the disputed problem of the connection of mind and body. This should at once furnish a good instance for throwing light on our own problem, and also serve to make clearer the difficulties that attend a formulation of the psycho-physical relation. As a preliminary, and to avoid complicating our problem with fundamental differences of standpoint, we may assume that both of the terms in the relation are for our purposes mental states, parts of one experience. We have simply the question as to what is the connection that is to be understood to exist between the one experience that we call sensation and the other experi- ence, the acting nerve-cell. If we regard them as two series of experiences that occur together, how much is there to mark them as causally related, and how much evidence to show that they are merely concomitant.</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.] PSYCHOLOGICAL NATURE OF CAUSALITY. 417 It may be assumed by universal consent that they possess the first two conditions of causality, -they are always found together, one invariably accompanies the other. There is a certain amount of interpretation even in this statement, but it is an interpretation that can hardly be avoided, and in the light of general acceptance needs no discussion. The quantitative relation may also be assumed to hold, roughly at least. So far as we may apply quantitative terms to the measurements of the series, we may say that change of intensity in a given direction in one series is always accompanied by a change in a similar direction in the other. Of course, no identity in the amount of energy transferred can be established between them, but there are extremely few cases of physical causation in which the amount of energy in the effective agent and in the process affected can be directly measured and shown to be identical. Evidently, then, the simpler, more direct tests would indicate unequivocally that the set of experi- ences which we call the bodily states are the causes of the mental states and that mental states are the causes of bodily movements. Still there is by no means general agreement that the one is the cause of the other, and the reason very evidently is that to call the connection causal cannot be made to square with the remainder of our experience. In the first place, we can find no analogy for the relation between body and mind in any other relation. It is a fact sui generis. Nowhere else are we com- pelled to connect all of our experience with a single small ele- ment of experience. Again, there is no possibility of analyzing the whole relation into a number of partial relations. We can analyze either experience separately into elements, body into brain and not-brain, brain into nerve-cells, nerve-cells conceivably into chemical elements, and, on the other hand, experience into ideas and sensations; but nowhere do we find the elements related more closely than are the two series as a whole. We can never see one pass over into the other, we never have anything more than the mere brute fact that the two processes are there side by side; there is no resolving, no comparing possible. When specific arguments are raised against regarding the two sets of experiences as causally related, it is always because the</page><page sequence="10">4i8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XIII. interpretation cannot be harmonized with the explanations that have been given for other facts of experience. To accept it, our conception of other physical laws must be changed. It is alleged that we cannot hold both to the doctrine of conservation of energy, or of the equivalence of energy between cause and effect, and to interaction between mind and body. Even when it is admitted that the physical doctrines in question are merely work- ing hypotheses, there is yet a marked indisposition to abandon principles of explanation that have served so useful a purpose in the organization of knowledge, for a new and isolated fact or principle. Even those writers who argue in favor of interaction furnish equally good evidence for the view that harmony with experience is the occasion for the origin of the feeling of causality. To them the importance of explaining more definitely, or rather, of picturing to themselves more distinctly, the rela- tion between body and mind seems greater than to retain the fundamental physical hypotheses. Experience seems less ade- quately organized when they leave uncertain the relation of body and mind than when they give up the doctrines of conserva- tion and equivalence of energy in the physical universe. They are ready to reorganize their knowledge about the assumption that there is a real interaction between body and mind, and will sacrifice all general principles of organization that are incompati- ble with it. Many of the historical theories of the relation of the body and mind and of their intimate nature can be seen to have developed in consequence of a desire to find an analogy for the relation which would permit it to be subsumed under some general cate- gory, without at the same time displacing some equally important fact. On the one hand, mind has been made an epiphenomenal accompaniment of the material; on the other, all real existence has been denied .to the group of experiences usually designated as physical, in order that the difficulty of settling the question as to the nature of the relation might be avoided. Or both groups of experience are reduced to a single homogeneous one, now mental, now physical, now neither, now both, that a causal rela- tion may be assumed and other fundamental laws be retained-;</page><page sequence="11">No. 4.] PSYCHOLOGICAL NA TURE OF CAUSALITY. 4I9 but no suggestion as yet seems to be able to harmonize the known facts of the relation of body and mind with the mass of knowledge already organized. All classifications that are sug- gested seem to leave some facts or some partial generalizations unincluded. Furthermore, the attempts of Fechner and others to find an analogy which will permit the two series to be essentially related to each other without assuming a causal relation, equally well show a desire to harmonize the relation with other experiences, even if causality must be given up, and illustrate the fact that it is conceivable that there may be a complete and universal con- comitance or an invariable succession - even a quantitative equiv- alence - of phenomena, without the implication of causation. Two conclusions are forced upon us from the consideration of the arguments as to the relation of mind and body. As to the latter, it is evident that what is needed for a general agreement that mind acts upon body and body upon mind, is to find a way of conceiving the relation that can be taken up into the general mass of knowledge without doing violence to any of the partial organizations already completed. This may come either by the way of some new method of conceiving the relation that shall steer between the Scylla of causal nexus and the Charybdis of concomitance without essential connection, or it may come through a reorganization of experience that shall make some of the general hypotheses which now stand as an obstacle seem unessential or disappear. What is needed is not an increase in the number of instances, but a new way of formulating the con- nection, or the discovery of related facts that may illumine the relation. As regards our main problem, it is evident that it is an essen- tial condition for the origin of the causal feeling that the connec- tion in question can be made to enter into relation with other events which are already regarded as causal. The causal rela- tion arises from a mutual support that each connection gives to all others. Mere frequency of succession or of concomitance alone is insufficient to bring up the impression of causality. W. B. PILLSBURY. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN.</page></plain_text>
