<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animal Homes. Sally Cartwright. 48pp. $3.86. Coward, McCann &amp; Geoghegan, Inc., 200 Madison Ave., New York City 10016. 1973. (Grades 1-3) The author has chosen a subject for this book which is popular with most children. The homes of four animals are described in considerable detail. In each case, the family of young animals is discussed in terms of number, in- dependence at birth, and parental care. The gray squirrel is presented as an example of an animal whose home is constructed above ground and whose young are very dependent at birth. Porcupine homes are found on the ground, and the woodchuck or groundhog is an example of an animal that digs tunnels underground. It is noted that the porcupine young are relatively independent, whereas the woodchuck young are dependent at birth. The home of the beaver is 38 SCIENCE and CHILDREN</page><page sequence="2">an example of a home under water. The young are less dependent, but mature more slowly than many other kinds of animals. The chart at the end of the book provides reference material on the homes of the four animals mentioned and four other kinds of animals - rabbit, chipmunk, mole, and skunk. Information about the care of the young and the construction of the nest is included. The text is simply written and very readable for most children of early grade levels. It might be criticized by some reviewers for anthropomorphism. "Beavers love the water" is an example. Much of the art is highly styl- ized whereas some has a more naturalistic characteristic.
