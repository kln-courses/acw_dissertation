<plain_text><page sequence="1">EJECTIVE PHILOSOPHY. BY TEIOS. P. BAIUCY, Jr., Fellow at Clark Untversity. Empiricismand intuitionalism have always been foes: the one abhors "subjectivity" without a history, the other despises un- critical "mechsnism." Yetboththese philosophicattitudes (for schools they are not) claim to rely on expericnce- and their clalms are just. Both admit that there are sensations andrelations be- tween sensations. The mechanically minded 8ee in sensations the real mind-stufi, and defiantly ask, what would become of your rela- tions, your intuitions, if their terms were taken away? You acknowl- edge that youfeel tqltUttiOX8, but are not those feelings the practical results (for life and conduct) of the workings of the psychical mech- anism? Even admitting that feeling is primary, how could you have cogntttre intuitions if you did not have language,which is a sensational symbolism at bottom? It is anthropomorphlsm thatmakes you feel that a cause pqoduces an effect. To be a logical believer in causa- tion? you must see powers working in all natural successions. But the lntuitionalist replies: Principles are the important things in life and mind, and sensations are but the handles whereby we may catch holdof intuitions. The genesis and the dressing of an ideadeter- mine nothing as to its validity. The practical results are ends, axld the psychological mechani8m is a means. Language necessarily has a sensational dress, for it appeals to the ear and the eye. But how about gesture and facial expression and the inherent grammatical categories which are the substance of which lanzuage i8 the shadow t You may slur the "ifs" and "buts" and "therefores," but YOU cannot thtnk without them. You cannot e2rplain away cause, be- cause you cannot transcend your experience. You cannot annihi- late reason without annihilating your cock-sure empiricism. Why has not the foolish belief in causation been annihilated by " natural selection?" You had better not talk about anthropomorphism while the sword of the idealist is bared. And so they have cried " come again!" at each other through the rolling centuries. I give merely samples of the fence-play. But Berkeley the idealist, was a man of faith, and Herbart, the empiricist, fougit utilitarianisTn so keenly as to stab at its masked face in the categorical Kant! How humanly precious is inconsistency in philosophy! These naive contradictions between theory and practice, logic and instinct, have for some time been foreshadowing the larger view of a biological and anthropological philosophy. Many of the old issues are dead or dying. The empiricists are learningsome lessons: However "de- rived," relations are now instinctive and are the most valuable of mental things; language had cognitive implications from the start and its growth has been in a cognitive direction, however much the sensational " terms " may vary; let us hold to a chastened anthro- pomorphism lest the idealist and the materialist destroy us we can think of matter only in terms of mind, and of mind only in terms of matter (Spencer) ;perhaps we had better ease up alittle on the "prinv</page><page sequence="2">466 BAILE Y: ciple of relativity" the biologically-minded have given us the better principle of fatigue, the discovery of hot and cold spots, the phenomena of monoideistic trance, etc.; the probability that there are pleasure and pain-fibers render the " theory of relativity " too metaphysical, and empiricists must beware of metaphysics, at least old metaphysics. The intuitionalists have also learned some lessons: Relations are not degraded by having pedigrees empiricists are often neither fools nor knaves; physiology and biology are magnificent allies; perhaps it is better not to dogmatize too much about the origin of languages,especially as we know 80 little about non-Aryan tongues, the North American Indianlanguage Stocks, for instance; the empir- icistis unable to do any harm in his efforts to disprove causation; let U8 allow him to jump out of his own skin if he wants to; on the other hand, let us beware of entangling alliances with the idealist, who insists that his skin is not spacial in essentta, for the true intuition- alist cannot afford to part with common sense perhaps foolish be- liefs may be inherited because they are usefulr perhaps we need a tiqq4e of pure tn8ttnct. We even begin to flnd a few intuitionalists that study Herbert 23pencer 8ympAthettcAlly, and an occasional em- piricistthat has patience with the Scottish school of philosophy. But the old issue is still before us-sight ver88u8 faith, sensation versus intuition. 5dhe trend of the best equipped and most earnest minds of today is, I think, toward instinct as the #tarting point, and the criterion of philosophical actinty. Then have the intuitionalists won? The criterion, but not the method. The empiricists have lacked faith in instinct, but they have had faith in sight. Now the method of science is to e2rpress relations in terms of quantitative sensations. Impossible as it i8 to weigh and measure faith, hope and charity, it is possible to objectivize to #ensationalize, or at least to symbolize in terms of the biologicai sciences our psychological and philosophical knowledge. 03hall not philosophy express her faith in terms of #ight? As is the psychology, #0 is the philosophy. Philosophy i8 the #cience of the sciences; it is the unifying, or, better #till, integrating science. Psychology (in the widest sense) is the mental science corresponding to the phy#ical sciences. Whatever else the terms of philosophy may denote, they certainly must represent facts of nor- mal experience. Logical puzzles and word-mongering are not phil- osophy. The time for seeking not4mena has passed, for phenomena are noumena, but there are phenomena and phenomena. Thinkers discriminate the relative and the absolute in experience: and psy- chology is the science of experience. But what sort of psychology? 5dhat which accepts all the facts of experience, does not try to ex- plain away any class of facts, does not accuse the human race of ineradicable illusion, has no metaphysical (materialistic or tradi- tional) theory to sustain; but which use# mechanical hypotheses wherever it can, does not worry itself about whether brain es- plains mind, or whether mind explains brain, interprets the results of trained and of untrained introspection, by means of objective sym- bols and analyses, expresses the laws of mental operations in term# of mechani#m, and the validity of mental relations in terms of spon- taneity. Such a psychology finds itself at home in brain-psycholo- gy and in abstract ethic#, without confounding the sciences or di- viding nature. Spirituali#t# and materialists, ideali#t# and realist#, pantheist# and thei#ts must all appeal to it, or be condemned to the nebulosity of an unscientific metaphysic. Philosophy must have a valid psychological starting point, a psychological standard and a psychological criterion. Shall we start with " sensation," or "intuition," or "feeling"(!), or "volition?" Inmyopinion, the</page><page sequence="3">starting point is mu#cular strain; the #tandard is impulse; the criterion 1# catholic human instinct, but I mu#t try to justify this opinion. It #eem# almo#t like sacrilege to que#tion the tripartite or trilog- ical din#ion of mind into " intellect, feeling and will." Without attacking the time-honored din#ion, let U# adopt another for the #ake of convenience. Mental fact# are of two kind#: the ejective and the effective. The ejective include# #en#ation and relation (intui- tion); effective include# impul#e and emotion. Sen#ation i# of two kind#: affective (plea#ure andpain) and objective (the "si2r#en#es"). Relation i# of three kind#: automahc, a# time, #pace, number etc. (the concept8 of time #pace, etc., are not here referred to); refie2r = biological, p#ychicai, #ocial = anTnzal (including homo sapTen8) in#tincts relation; intuitive - e#thetical, logical, ethical= human instinct relation. Turning now to the effective, impulse i# mu#cular feeling with a trend toward outwardne## (away from dif- fu#ed #ubjectivity) activity in a definite direction integration for an end. Emotion 1# mu#cular feeling with a trena toward inward- ne## (away from definite objectivity), reaction in a (mentally) in- definite direction, #egregation for recuperation. Now, how i# EU#- cular feeling the #tarting point of philo#ophy? Movement i# the end of mind as motion i# the end of matter. Matter i# a " permanent po#sibility," not of " sen#ation," but of motion. Mind i# a " permanent po##ibility " not of " having #en#a- tion," but of movement (mu#cular feeling5. In the refie2: arc the #en#e-organ and the nerve-centre e2ri#t for the mu#cular contrac- tion.

A7w 'lemotion " may be a mental attitude involving all "element#." I choo#e to limit the term to effective reactiare, refies mu#cular. Mu#cular feeling ought to be the #tarzing point of p#ychology and philosophy, becau#e it i# the raw #tuff of activity throughout the mental #phere, and make# pO#- sible an appreciation of the outer world of force. Activity must be guided, and it# guidance i# all important, but we start with the act- ivity it#elf. ImpUl#e i# the p#ychological and philo#ophical #tandard. Having decided to #tart with the effective #ide of the mental life, we #hall find our#elve# called on to choo#e a #tandard of mental currency. Relation# may control the fiow of our mental money, may adjust supply to demand, may determine amount of reserve fund and -kind of inve#tment, but there mu#t be coin of the realmin plenty, and into which mental paper i# ea#ily collvertible. Shall we choose a# the #tandard, impul#e or emotion? Vnque#tionably impulse. It most nearly represent# irritability; it i# the eSective #ide of primary in#tinct#; it #tand# for definitene##, coherence, integration; it i# the ba#i# of will and of work.

Emotioni#reactiveand#econdary; it# primary function #eem#to be the reflex overcoming of the inhibition of normal actinty. Apart from in#tinctive outbreak#, emotion in man seems to be ac- quiring a #egregating, recuperative function, and to be more and more characteristic of play a# oppo#ed to work. (What we value in an emotion i# ths intuitioll, the relation, in it.) It# pathologic tendencie# are many and variou#; emotional character# never be- come integrated. You can play upon them a# on the #tring# of a harp. Emotion# are repre#ented and accompanied in the ejective sphere by plea#ure and pain, and are guided by the #elf-relation#. When limited to the function of recuperation, and when recupera- tion prepareafo7* the impul#e - attitude - work, emotion# are nece##ary becau#e play i#. But impul#e i# the gold #tandard of our mental mechani#m of exchange. Our wealth i# in the uncon#ciou#, i# or- ganic, and it i# our bu#ine## to inve#t it productively. Philo#ophy ought to regard a# it# normal individual# only tho#e who maintain a #ufficient gold re#erve fund of #pontaneou# impul#e.

Affective sensations diituse, but in themselves have no effectivenes#, no more than objectivs sen#ations have The affective consciou#ne#s occupie# a #mall #hare of normal life as compared mrith the healthy, almost tonele## work-period. If our potential energy i# being replaced a# fa#t a# tt become# kinetic, we expect the diffused ccene#thetic emotion to be the re#ult of recrea- tion and therefore to give moderate unobtru#ive #ati#faction. The great plea#ure# and the great paina are refle2: organic affair#, and will not furni#h a ba#i# for philo#ophy. They are unu#llal and they have no effectivene##. In extreme ca#e#, the effective #en#ation# paralyze the mu#cle# (become di##ociated from effectivene#S) and efface con#ciou#ne##. Nor can philo#ophy be con#tructed on the idea that play i# the goal of life. Play i# a preparation for work, for progres#, or it has no philo#ophical meaning. Even the delight# of the " ae#thetic emotion# " are abnormal, harmful, di#integrating un- le## they help on that recreation that fit# U# for work. The rational man would not want to live in a heaven of eternal play. He would a#k for the " #earch for truth, for in#tance, not to have truth come gurgling down hi# mental throat. If philo#ophy, if ethic#, wants a summum bonum that every normal per#on can under#tand, it would not be the " greate#t happine## of the greate#t number," nor " #elf- realization, nor " action con#onant w-ith law univer#al," but all of these and more the mo#t adaptive and expres#ive work and play that make for the kingdom of heaven. I do not intend to develop this formula, but content my#elf with adding another ejective (self- objective) maxim: Work for thy living and live for thy work. The criterion of philo#ophy i# catholic human in#tinct. When Socrates and hi# friend# had fini#hed their di#course# without being able to definitely #et forth the e##ence of courage and wisdom and virtue, he used to #ay, neverthele##, let U# practice them; after De#carte# had proved animal automati#m #ati#factorily to himself, re#pect for man'# relational in#tinct# made him re#cue human beings from blank mechani#m; when Kant had fini#hed hi# wonder- ful feats in the realm of pure rea#on he came back to faith and irlstinct, and exalted #pontaneity into a metaphy#ical principle. The greate#t philo#opher# have been unable to reduce all being to one sub#tance and all relation to one principle because they respected intuition. Some of them have tried to ju#tify the intuitions of God, spontaneity-immortality, #ome have con- tented themselves with simple affirmation, some have confessed the im?otency of reason to justify them, but all have held to them. The objective le##er light# have given U# mechani#m, materialisrn, agnosticism (becau#e we now only " Know in part? "). The #ubjec- tive logicians have given U# mysticism, idealism, pantheism. The lower grade thinkers have set forth eclectic and mixed system#, s-arying in eclecticism and guess-work. Ejective philosophy, with its ob;}ect-subject starting point inmuscular feeling,anditsoutward tending work-standard in impulse, strive# to investigate the condi- tions under which truth, beauty and right originate, to set forth its results in empirical terms borrowed from the objectively known (z. e., science), seeks its leading principles in the philosophyof charac- tew and religion; it believes that there is a purpose in history and in life, that the deepestintuitions of the human race cctnnot be illusions; it believes that philosophy, having had centuries of sight, ,7ili return to its primitive attitude of faith. But the content of that attitude is very difterent. The second childhood of philosophy is notof innocence,butof grace; born of need of glliding in#tinct#.

All the sciences have their metaphy#ic, and philo#ophy ha# all the science#. Skepticism i# ruled out, not criticism- materiali#m and idealism, not physiological psychology and logic, ethic# and aesthetics; agnosticism and pantheism, not rationalism and theism. There mu#t be a " #ynthetic philosophy," but human instinct must judge it# result#. Above all, do we want a clearing up not only of the " notions " (indeed, some " notions " need critical distinction and others a bodily form), but of the instincts. Ejective philosophy has an eft ective starting-point and norm, but its criterion i# ejective. Of the ejective relations, the eesthetical are the ones that will dominate philosophy; a critique of the sthetical in nature, in character, in the conceptions of God, immortality and the soul, will, I believe, be a main work of the philosophy of the future. Redintegration, integration, disintegration, habit, law correspondence with environment, development, character monism, ideal, type holines#, fitness, symmetry, harmony these and many more of liiEe nature are the ideas of the philo#ophy " that is in the air. " Anthropomorphism is becoming sesthetical. As might be expected, theology show# this tendency most plainly: no longer the Moral Governor or the Righteou# Sovereign, or the Unknowable Power; but the iather, who know# andcare# about the sparrow's fall, though it must fall; whose sons we are. Religion has cea#ed to ponder how the Fatller knows or why He cares; it is becoming more and more biological, and, therefore, it# ethical life more #pantaneou#andaesthetical. Men prize #pontaneity, but are beginning to say, let the contingent become the neces#ary, let the neces#ary be the spontaneou#, and the will on earth correspond to the holiness, the completenes# of working of the will in heaven. Absolute right i# absolute utility; that all may be will-holy, com- plete, not that we may be happy, though wewi]l beif wefitin with things eternal. Let cogtto, ergo sum be fido ergo f¢i, spero ergo fero, amo ergo sum. Let U#, therefore, say that ejective philosophy will exalt sestheti- cal anthropomorphism, and that it will be biological, instinctive historical and blblical. Biological: Notice the tremendous sweep of these terms (for natural " analyse# " are the parables of philoso- phy)-cell, differentiatian, degeneration, environment, survival of the fittest, heredity, conformity to type, etc. Instinctive: Critique of instinct. Duty becomes privilege; " the law " becomes s; grace " (the instinct of holiness). Historical: Genesis and history of rela- tions. A certain environment is necessary for their mar^festatzor^. A high brain is a necessary environment for a high character. High brain is a new representation of force just as a high character is a new representation of energy. In character development, integra- tion (kinassthesis of work and conassthesis of character, both relational, conceptual), self becomes objectified (an apperceptive eJect), a power working for an end set for it. Biblical: Biologi- cal, instinctive, historical. Ye work (rwal aim) neither for happi- ness nor for right, truth and beauty, " but seek ye Arst (primary attitude) hts kingdom, and hts righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you (Christ had just before spoken of the lilies of the field). At the risk of being tiresome and of repeating, let me sum up the whole matter as itappearsto me atthismoment. "Proveallthings; butholdfirsttothat which is good" (Paul the Apostle: I Thess. v. 21, R. V., marginal reading). Let us see if we have not caught hold of some of the most vital things of faith in the wrong wav. Let us not "reconcile" by concessions, by eclecticism, but let us</page><page sequence="7">EJECTIVE PHILOSOPHY. 471 have a e.ritique of pure relational human instinct, our ideal being the perfect one, who called himself THE Son of Man. Let us work, build up, find new philosophical relations, ask for " copy ' of science and art and life. Let U# have all-sided energy-based, rela- tion-guidedanthropomorphism. Let us take iold of intuitionalist instinet by an empiricist handle. We side with both intuitionalist and empiricist in having philosophy ejective and not effective. BSective philosophy runs into materialism, or into mysticism, or into both, with all grades of abnormality between. Philosophy is representative, and, therefore, it is ejective. Man is not objective (matter) nor subjective (self-feeling), but ejective, self-objective, apperceptive, actively personal,. an agent and a steward. Atheism, agnosticism, panthelsm, and the rest of them are sim- ply tiresome, unesthetic. They fail to help us to work, tiey fail to e2rplain things because things cannot be explained either objectively or subjectively, but only ejectively anthropomorl?hically, in the higher aesthetic sense of the word. TiXngs are e2rplalned when they all fit in together with our purest faith and our best work. If I succeed in suggesting "what is in the (philosophic) air," I shall be satisfied. 15 East Senate Street. GOLUMBIA, S. a., March 11, 1893.</page></plain_text>
