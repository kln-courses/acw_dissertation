A Critical Rationalist Perspective ALI PAYA* Abstract The aim of this paper is to introduce a critical rationalist approach to studying the Qur'an. Following a short introduction , I shall introduce the main tenets of cńtical rationalism with a short account of religion according to this approach. The paper shall then briefly discuss a cluster of related notions , namely , 1 algorithmic compressibility,' ' complex systems ,' and 1 logical depth.' Taking stock from this discussion , the writer argues that the Qur'an is a complex system with a significant logical depth and that its message can be best understood with a critical rationalist approach. Further , This approach will be analysed vis-a-vis the method of istintaq (interrogation) introduced by ' Ali b. Abu Tālib in Nahj al-Balāgah. Finally, some possible criticism to the critical rationalist approach to studying the Qur'an will be considered. &lt;0&gt; Introduction Given the importance of the Qur'an for Muslims, any effort whose end result is to help readers to better understand and appreciate the message of this book (which Muslims regard as holy and as God's words)1 in an objective fashion ought to be welcomed by all those who are interested in benefiting from the 4 A number of friends and colleagues (David Miller, Hossein Paya, Jeremy Shearmur Isa Jahangir, Jafar Elmi, Mohammed Ali Ismail) have read earlier drafts of this paper and made many useful comments. I should like to thank them all. However, the responsibility for any shortcoming in the paper rests entirely with me. 1 The nature of the Qur'an has been the subject of many debates among Muslim scholars in the history of Islamic thought. Contrary to mainstream view, some modern scholars maintain that the Qur'an was the outcome of the Prophet's religious experiences and as such should not be regarded as a verbatim account of God's revelation to His messenger (see Nasr Hāmīd Abū Zayd, Mafhūm al-Nass: Dīrāsah fi ' Ulūm al-Qur'an (Beirut: Al-Markaz al-Thaqāfī al-'Arabī, 1990), Abdulkarim Soroush, "Muhammad (S): Rāvī-ē Royāhā-ē Rasūlānah" (The Prophet as the Narrator of the Prophetic Dreams), available at: http://www.rahesabz.net/story/71738/.</page><page sequence="2">176 ali paya content of this book. The present study is based on a particular epistemic/ philosophical approach known as critical rationalism. The primary audience of the paper is Muslims, though its approach and conclusions could be, it is hoped, of interest to non-Muslim audiences as well. Critical Rationalism Critical rationalism is a way of life and a philosophical outlook. It was first introduced by Karl Popper2 and was further developed by his students and colleagues.3 Some of the main tenets of this way of life/intellectual perspective are as follows,4 Critical rationalism is a quest for knowledge and truth, for 'emancipation through knowledge' and 'spiritual freedom'; The critical attitude that seeks undogmatically to subject all attitudes, ideas, institutions, and traditions, along with so-called knowledge and so-called freedom, to critical examination and appraisal;5 Critical rationalists emphasise the need to recognise everybody with whom one communicates as a potential source of argument and of reasonable information and take the attitude that I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort we may get nearer to the truth.6 As a methodological framework critical rationalism upholds the following theses, among others: * There is something (reality) not created by man's ideas, language and/ or conventions. This reality, though full of mysteries, nevertheless is assumed to be comprehensible. 2 For reason of space, I limit myself to only two of Popper's books on this topic: Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (London, Routledge: 1963/2002) and Objective Knowledge: An Evolutionary Approach (Oxford, OUP: 1979). 3 For reason of space I only mention two of Popper's closest students/ colleagues: David Miller, Critical Rationalism: A Restatement and Defence (Chicago, Open Court: 1994) and Out of Error: Further Essays on Critical Rationalism (Surrey Ashgate, 2006); Jeremy Shearmur, The Political Thought of Karl Popper (London: Routledge, 1996). 4 This section is partly based on Ali Paya, WA Critical Assessment of the Programmes of Producing 'Islamic Science' and 'Islamisation of Science/Knowledge,"' International Studies of the Philosophy of Science 29, no. 3 (2015) 311-335 and Paya, Methods and Perspectives in Islamic Studies (London: ICAS Press, forthcoming). 5 Popper, Conjectures and Refutations, , 175; William Bartley, "The Philosophy of Karl Popper: Part III.

A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE ļjj * All knowledge claims are conjectural and remain conjectural until they are refuted. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to get closer to a true understanding of reality, whether natural or socially constructed, through learning through our own mistakes and by reflecting on the mistakes made by others. * All observations are theory-laden. There is no such a thing as 'brute or naked' (i.e. un-interpreted) fact. * It is the 'growth of interesting and informative knowledge about reality,' and not 'knowledge per se,' which is important. * Knowledge only grows through our dealing with the challenges presented to us by reality (in its various manifestations). In response to these challenges we produce conjectures (as possible solutions) and critically examine them to find possible faults in them in the hope of improving upon them. The following two schemata present the way we develop our knowledge: Pi -&gt; TS - ► EE - &gt; Pi (Fig. 1. Simple Scheme of Conjectures and Refutations) TSl Vl Pi - TSn ► EE-* Pn I Sn m Pn + m (Fig 2. The Fully Fledged Scheme of Conjectures and Refutations) In the above schemata, Pi is a problem which presents itself to the inquirer. TS is a tentative solution which the inquirer produces (in the shape of a conjecture) to solve the problem. There may be more than one solution for the problem with which the inquirer is grappling (TSi ... TSn+m). Each proposed solution should then be subjected to the process of error elimination</page><page sequence="4">178 ALI PAYA (EE). Each genuine problem, almost invariably, introduces in its wake, fresh new problems (P2 ... Pn+m) due to the fact that reality, as critical rationalists assume, is not exhausted by our conjectures and constantly introduces new aspects/ challenges. * Knowledge advances in two complementary ways: via negativa and via positiva. The former concerns what we learn from disproving the conjectures made about the reality of things. We learn that reality is not the way these conjectures explain. The latter pertains to conjectures which so far, and despite our best efforts to refute them, have proved resilient and remained corroborated. Such claims are regarded as our best provisional candidates for knowledge about reality. * Critical assessment of conjectures are made in two ways: for all those knowledge claims and conjectures which have empirical content and deal with empirically accessible aspects of reality assessment will be done by means of empirical testing as well as analytical (i.e. rational, logical, and philosophical) evaluations. For those knowledge claims which do not have empirically testable contents and/or are about those aspects of reality which are not empirically accessible, and are neither empty nor truism nor tautology, assessment will be done by analytical means. Such claims can also be assessed in an indirect way by evaluating empirical/ practical consequences which may result from them. * Morality/ethics and growth of knowledge are closely connected. Morality manifests its role in the growth of knowledge in at least two ways. On the one hand, inquirers must regard 'others' as ends in themselves and not means. This is because it is only through dialogue with 'others' that one can hope to correct one's mistakes (avoids one's epistemological blind spots) and also get access to unique sources of knowledge.7 But proper dialogue can only take place if the interlocutors regard the other as belonging to the category of ends in themselves. On the other hand, inquirers must avoid resorting to any tactic, for example, obscurantism or ad-hoc manoeuvres, which would make the task of critical assessment of their knowledge claims less effective.8 * Pluralism (in the sense of the diversity of ideas and views and the existence of pluralistic knowledge eco-niches) is of great importance for the growth of knowledge. In a pluralistic environment, in which a larger variety of conjectures can be produced as possible solutions to the challenges presented by reality, the chances of stumbling upon a conjecture which is on the right track are much higher than the eco-systems in which one or few 7 Popper, Open Society , chap. 23. 8 Popper, Myth.</page><page sequence="5">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'ÂN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE yjy dominant views stifle the flourishing of alternative ideas or suppress their emergence. * Justification, of all sorts and types, is impossible. Whatever people suggest as a justification for their claim is in need for further justification.9 * Induction, as a method of logical inference, is invalid, and as a method for discovery is impossible.10 * The so-called 'problem of induction,' generalisation from a limited set of data, is one of the aspects of 'the problem of demarcation,' distinguishing between genuine knowledge and pseudo-knowledge. The latter problem is about what we learn the former about how we learn.11 * Critical rationalists introduce the following finer sub-divisions in reality: the natural (physical) part of reality (Worldi (Wi)), the subjective content of each individual's cognitive and emotive apparatus (Workb (W2)), and the sphere which contains ALL publicly available products of human interaction with reality (World3 (W3)). W3 contains all intellectual/linguistic (in the extended sense of the term) products. It is the abode of entities such as our theories, moral principles, legal codes, blueprints and plans of all technological products, music, poetry, religious, philosophical, and other types of ideas, etc. W3 is as real as the other realities. This is because entities in W3 have the power of influencing other aspects of reality.12 * W2 is the link between Wi and W3. Challenges presented to people (W 2s) would prompt them to come up with solutions. The conceptual contents of these solutions belong to W3. Similarly, the ideas deposited in W3 could prompt people to make changes in Wi. * Knowledge claims ought to be objective. Objectivity boils down to 'public accessibility and public assessability.'13 * Human knowledge is not absolute, certain, infallible, indubitable, justified. In other words, our knowledge claims, which are always conjectural, cannot- no matter how accurate they are- fully capture reality. The reality, as critical rationalists surmise, is indeterminately infinite, whereas we are finite, fallible creatures with limited cognitive abilities. * Certainty/ certitude belongs to the realm of personal psychology. It is not an epistemologica! category. Psychology deals with external causes, 9 David W. Miller, Studia Philosophica Wratislaviensia 3, no., 1 (2008): 9-18. 10 Miller, Out of Error , chap. 5. 11 Ibid., 4. 12 Popper, Objective Knowledge. 13 Ali Paya, "The Misguided Conception of Objectivity in Humanities and Social Sciences," in The Crisis of the Human Sciences False Objectivity and the Decline of Creativity , ed.

It is possible to induce 'certainty/certitude' about certain ideas/claims in individuals' minds by non- cognitive means such as brain-washing and propaganda. Individuals may also acquire certainty as a result of their existential experiences. However, whatever about which individuals are 'certain,' as a result of external stimuli or personal experiences, as long as it remains in their W2 it cannot be regarded as knowledge in the strict and proper sense of this term since it is neither publicly accessible nor publicly assessable. * Whatever becomes part of the three worlds (1, 2, and 3), i.e. the realm to which human beings have access, would inevitably and necessarily, assume all the limitations of these three worlds. Within each world there are indeterminately large number of capacities and potentials which can, in principle, be actualised. W3 contains entities, such as all types of mathematical infinities, which are infinitely large. * All theories (conjectures, hypotheses, etc.), which are needed to be produced in response to the challenges presented by reality, must be constructed by us. Reality does not suggest any solution or conjecture (theories). The role of reality is to act as a referee and judge in assessing the tenability (or otherwise) of our proposed conjectures (solutions).14 * In the course of acquiring knowledge by means of method of conjectures and refutations, one ought to distinguish between two important contexts: the context of discovery and the context of assessment. The role of these two contexts in producing knowledge is different but complementary. Neither can, in the absence of the other, produce knowledge. The context of discovery belongs to the realm of personal psychology. It is intimately related to one's W2. It is the arena in which, as a result of one's constant and systematic grappling with the problem(s) one is dealing with, the ťsolution(s)' to one's problem(s) may be 'envisioned' or 'experienced' in the shape of flashes of insight, moments of epiphany, flares of intuition and their ilk. These visions/experiences, which are all 'existential' in kind and not 'epistemological,' are, by their very nature, transitory and short-lived. As soon as they are over, one needs to 'reconstruct' them by means of one's memory, concepts and language. The reconstructed 'solution(s)' must then be presented to 'the context of assessment,' which is the public arena and must be assessed critically to expose their faults and defects. 'Reconstructed' versions of 'existential moments' can never fully represent reality since our language and concepts always remain imperfect. Nevertheless, such 'reconstructions' can, in principle, present good approximate representations of some aspects of reality 14 Popper, Myth, chap. 1.</page><page sequence="7">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'AN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE jg j and it is not impossible to get closer to better understanding of reality via such 'reconstructions. ' Critical Rationalism and Religion As a critical rationalist, I maintain that almost all religions, and at the very least those that belong to the Abrahamie tradition, consist of two principal parts:15 an ontological-epistemological and a technological part. The first part is comprised of the following two simple statements:16 (a) Ontological part: The realm of being has a Lord or Master. (b) Epistemological part: It is, in principle, possible for mankind to acquire knowledge of the Lord/Master of the realm of being. The first statement is extremely compact and needs to be unpacked. The process of unpacking the entailments of this statement leads to the emergence of a rich and ever-expanding network of meaning with regards to the attributes of the Lord/Master of being. Different religions may attribute different characteristics to this Lord/Master. In some religions, the Lord/Master may be regarded as the Creator and Sustainer of the realm of being. Attributes such as infinite wisdom, power, and compassion are among many characteristics attributed to the Lord/Master of being. In some other, the Lord/Master may be described by means of anthropomorphic attributes such as eyes, ears, hands, etc. In other religions the Lord/Master may be identified with an amorphous cosmic force or energy. The second part of religions is a set of technologies in the shape of rituals and instructions for actions and conducts.17 Technologies of all sorts and types, as I have explained elsewhere,18 have two main functions: some respond to people's non-cognitive needs. Cars, houses, foods, systems of governments (including democracies), banks, cinemas, etc. are examples of the technologies which serve the above function. Some other technologies facilitate, only as tools and instruments, our cognitive/knowledge pursuit. Of course 15 Ali Paya, "A Popperian (Critical Rationalist) Approach to Religion," in Proceedings of the International Symposium on Karl Popper and the Problem of Change (Ankara: Eskiyeni, forthcoming). 16 Paya, "Religious Technology: Nature and Possibility," Journal of Methodology of Social Sciences and Humanities 18, no. 73 (2012): 7-52. 17 Paya, "Religious Technology"; Paya, "Critical Assessment." 18 Paya, "How Indigenous are 'Indigenous Sciences'?

Aron Bala (Suffolk: Palgrave, 2012); Paya, "Critical Assessment"; Paya, "Misguided Conception."</page><page sequence="8">ļg2 ALI PAYA computers, books, eye-glasses, pens, etc. are examples of this second class of technologies. Some technologies, like mobile phones, have both functions. Religious technologies, just like all other technologies, have the two aforementioned functions, albeit in the sphere of religious aims and objectives. Religious rituals and rites such as daily prayers, hajj, zakāh (alms), fasting, instructions for conducting financial transactions and business dealings (ma'āmlāt) are all technologies: they either respond to people's non-cognitive needs in a religious context (for example, in the case of zakah) or facilitate (as mere instrument) people's pursuit of their cognitive needs in their religious life. Prayers, for example, can elevate believers and assist them in their pursuit of acquiring a more truthful understanding of God. However, prayers, on their own, are not knowledge. Some religious technologies can serve both functions of technologies at once. For example, hajj can assist Muslim communities in their non-cognitive need of strengthening their solidarity and communal bonds and also assist the faithful in their cognitive pursuit of acquiring a better understanding of God.19 A sure sign of the effective use of religious technologies by the faithful is the effect of those technologies on the outlook and conduct of the believers. For example, in the case of those believers who apparently observe all their religious rituals but their outward conducts remain unacceptable (e.g., they cheat, act immorally and treat others unjustly), then one can safely assume that they have not benefitted from the religious technologies they have used.20 Complex System, Algorithmic Compressibility, Logical depth and the Qur'ân One of the phenomena that have greatly interested many scientists and scholars in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries is complex systems. Scientists have made great advances in exploring the types, characteristics and modes of behaviour of such systems. In the 1960s some scientists (Andrey Kolmogorov (1903-1987) in the USSR and Gregory Chaitin in the USA), who were involved in developing the nascent science of information, put forward the following idea for identifying complex systems and separating them from both simple systems and random systems (see below). They suggested that 'the complexity of something can be defined as the length of the shortest possible description of that thing.'21 19 Paya, Religious Technology. 20 Ibid. 21 Paul Davis, The Cosmic Blueprint (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1988), 250.</page><page sequence="9">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'AN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE ļgļ Simple systems are those that can be described by means of short descriptions. On the other hand, random systems, i.e. systems which do not show any pattern or regularity, can either be described by a simple, though uninformative, message, namely, 'systems which have no pattern,' or by messages whose lengths are as long as the length of the systems themselves. Therefore, random systems cannot be described by means of compressed messages and remain algorithmically incompressible.22 In contrast to these two types of systems, there are complex systems which can be represented by algorithmically compressible messages. For example, the behaviour of the solar system (i.e. the positions of the planets around the Sun) can be described by means of Newton's laws. In other words, the solar system is algorithmically compressible. Scientists have realised that for complex systems to be algorithmically compressible they must display regular patterns and order.23 When scientists turned their attention to the universe at large they noted that it is a different type of complex system: while many regularities, orders and patterns can be discovered in the universe there are also chaotic systems in the universe which display no (apparent) regularity or pattern. This led scientists to a new notion, namely, 'organised complexity.'24 All complex systems, including the universe, which represent a mixture of fathomable orders and patterns alongside unfathomable 'apparent' disorder and irregularity, have 'organised complexity.' The next step was taken by Charles Bennett an American scientist at IBM who suggested a way for identifying complex systems in a more qualitative, rather than quantitative, fashion. Bennett introduced the notion of 'logical depth' as a criterion for assessing the 'quality' or 'depth' of a message contained in a system [A] typical sequence of coin tosses has high information content but little value; an ephemeris, giving the positions of the moon and planets every day for a hundred years, has no more information than the equations of motion and initial 22 One may ask here, "But can't one produce formulae which will, in effect, simulate random sequences?" and one may give as an example of the formulas suggested for generating primes numbers (which are sequences of random numbers). But as mathematicians have argued, while such formulas exist they are worthless. See, Margaret Owens, "Is There a Formula that Generates Prime Numbers?", https://web.sonomaedu/math/colloq/primes sonoma state 9 24 08.pdf. 23 Paul Davis, "Algorithmic Compressibility, Fundamental and Phenomenological Laws," in Laws of Nature: Essays on the Philosophical , Scientific and Historical Dimensions , ed. Friedel Weinert (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1995). 24 Paul Davis, The Mind of God: The Scientific Basis for a Rational World (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992), 136.</page><page sequence="10">jg4 ALI PAYA conditions from which it was calculated, but saves its owner the effort of recalculating these positions. The value of a message thus appears to reside not in its information (its absolutely unpredictable parts), nor in its obvious redundancy (verbatim repetitions, unequal digit frequencies), but rather in what might be called its buried redundancy- parts predictable only with difficulty, things the receiver could in principle have figured out without being told, but only at considerable cost in money, time, or computation. In other words, the value of a message is the amount of mathematical or other work plausibly done by its originator, which its receiver is saved from having to repeat.2:&gt; In other words, Bennett suggested that the more work done by the creator of a system to produce it, the greater the logical depth of the system in question. The difference between a real skeleton and a wooden (model) skeleton (used for educational purposes for children) can better explicate the point suggested above. The difference between the two skeletons with regard to their logical depth' is as follows: For a real skeleton to be produced, the universe, (according to the current cosmological theories) has had to evolve from the original 'Big Bang' for 13.7 billion years. This means that the information of a&gt; unique evolutionary journey that a particular skeleton has experienced can be gleaned from it, layer by layer. For this reason, a real skeleton has a significant 'logical depth' with regard to the path the universe has taken to produce a human skeleton. A wooden skeleton, on the other hand, has only a limited amount of information with regard to taking the shape of a skeleton: it only represents the amount of work put into some piece wood by a carpenter or an artist to produce this particular shape. This is why the study of a wooden skeleton does not provide much information for a biologist who is interested in the evolution of human skeleton. Of course, the wood used in constructing a wooden skeleton contains in itself a considerable amount of information concerning the unique evolutionary journey which it has experienced to evolve from the original 'Big Bang' into this piece of wood. But here what we are interested in is the information concerning the formation and emergence of the human skeleton and not wood. 'Logical depth' and 'algorithmic compressibility' are both measures for assessing the degree of complexity of systems. Since complex systems can be 25 Charles H. Bennett, "Logical Depth and Physical Complexity" in The Universal Turing Machine: A Half-Century Survey , ed. Rolf Herken (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 227- 57.</page><page sequence="11">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'AN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE jgťj simulated by computers, the difference between the above two measures can be described in the following way: 'whereas algorithmic complexity focuses on the length of the minimal programme to yield a given output, logical depth is concerned with the running time for the minimal programme to generate that output.'26 The notion of 'logical depth' and richness of the information of complex systems is also closely related to the degree of 'order' which systems display. Scientists use the notion of entropy to describe the degree of 'disorder' of a system. 'Entropy is the number of different ways by which one can rearrange the smallest parts of the system and still get the same system.'27 A pile of rubble can be 'rearranged' in many different ways without change to the 'system.' In other words, the pile of rubble is not sensitive to changes in the arrangements of its parts. It is, in this sense, highly disordered. On the other hand, an elegant house or an artistic masterpiece, such as Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa, or a poem by Hāfiz, are all highly sensitive to 're-arrangements' of their smaller parts: these complex systems are highly ordered; they have considerable logical depth. From the above discussion, it can be surmised that the Qur'än is a 'complex' system' with significant 'logical depth.' It is a highly organised system with a great degree of order and a high information content. It can be conjecturally suggested that the Qur'än is an 'open book' just like the 'book of nature or the cosmos at large': both contain what God has put in them for the guidance of mankind.28 The two 'books' complement each other and have many things in common. For example, both present patterns and regularities that can be reconstructed by means of algorithmically compressed messages, and although in the case of the Qur'än we do not encounter a 'chaotic sub- system,' both systems of the Qur'än and the cosmos also present apparently unfathomable evidence that does not resemble familiar patterns or order.29 There are also some differences between the two 'books.' The Qur'än, contrary to the 'book of nature,' contains both descriptive and prescriptive (normative) information. While the book of nature provides us with 26 Davis, Mind of God, 137. Kate Becker, "Is Information Fundamental?" http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs / physics/ 2014/ 04/is-information-fundamental/, accessed: 29/ 1 1/2014. 28 The idea of God's two books is common among the Abrahamie religions (Michael Lessnoff, "Islam, Modernity and Science," in Ernest Gellner and Contemporary Social Thought , ed. Sinisa Malesevic and Mark Haugaard (Cambridge: CUP, 2007). Muslim scholars have referred to these two books as al-kitab al-takwini and al-kitāb al-tadwinl (Seyyed Hossein Nasr, Islamic Science: An Illustrated Study (London: World of Islam Festival, 1976)). 29 There are certain verses in the Qur'an over whose meanings commentators have agonised for centuries. Verses 5-10 in Surah al-Najm are cases in point.</page><page sequence="12">186 ALI PAYA information about the phenomenal world (whether observable or unobservable) and also about unobserved reality beyond the realm of phenomena, the Qur'ân provides mankind (mostly, though not exclusively) with guidelines which helps them to become deserving vicegerents of God on earth. This means that the message of this book is (mostly) directed towards issues related to a particular category, or if you like 'universe,' known as 'the human condition' (see below). Just in the same way that nature cannot guide people with respect to proper codes of conduct (such a demand would amount to the so-called 'naturalistic fallacy'), it would be a category mistake to expect from the Qur'ân guidance concerning natural phenomena, for example, how to develop a model of quantum physics or genomics. What and How Can We Learn from the Qur'ân? • The Qur'ân's rich content can best help us in furthering our knowledge with regard to the 'universe' of 'the human condition' in three ways. 1- It can act as a judge to expose the defects in conjectures suggested by us as solutions for problems related to this "universe." 2- As a source for heuristic insights concerning general directions/frameworks for possible solutions for the problems related to the above 'universe' with which we are grappling. And, 3- As a source for introducing new and novel problems related to the category of 'the human condition.' The following is small sample of some problems related to the 'universe' of 'the human condition': 'how to live a good life?'; 'what are our rights and responsibilities with regard to the Lord of the realm of being?'; 'are there universal values acceptable to all people in all times and places?'; 'how and in what ways can human agents reduce human suffering?'; 'what is the best way of curbing/ controlling political power and utilising it in optimal manners?'; which one of the two values of justice and liberty trumps the other and takes precedence over it?' This list can, of course, goes on and on. The Qur'ân, as a source of knowledge, does not provide us with straightforward and direct solutions (conjectures, theories) for our problems. Theories/conjectures/solution must be produced by us. Conjectures/theories are always man-made. The Qur'ân (as part of reality) can act as a judge and referee in exposing the defects of our proposed conjectures/solutions in response to certain problems and thus assisting us in correcting our mistake(s) (No. 1 above). Now suppose with respect to some 'problems/challenges' related to the category of 'the human condition' we develop a conjecture. To get help from the Qur'ân, as one possible source for assisting us in critically assessing our conjecture, we need to enter into a critical dialogue with the Qur'ân. Suppose our proposed conjecture is refuted as a result of our</page><page sequence="13">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'ÂN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE ļg 7 consultation with the Qur'ân. Here, as was explained above, we learn something about 'the human condition' albeit in a negative way. It must be emphasised that when consulting the Qur'ân for any of the three purposes explained above we must always have our tentative conjecture/ theory ready at hand. One should not expect that the Qur'ân provides one with specific conjecture/theories with regard to specific issues. Theories/ conjectures are constructed by us (as possible solutions) in response to the challenges presented to us by reality. We project these conjectures/theories to reality (whether natural or socially constructed- including texts) in a bid to get corrected by reality. Reality acts as the final arbiter of our knowledge claims which are constructed in terms of conjectures and theories. The point mentioned above, concerning the absence of theories/conjectures in the Qur'ân, needs further explanation to avoid possible misunderstanding. The above only represents the views of those who maintain that the Qur'ân is the word of God without any alteration. Theories/conjectures are the products of fallible entities with imperfect cognitive abilities. Since the producers of theories/conjectures are imperfect, their products will also be imperfect. It is for this reason that human beings, in their endeavours to improve their knowledge of reality, try to expose the defects and shortcomings of their conjectures and replace them by better conjectures. God, however, is the perfect Being. He does not need to make conjectures for capturing reality. Whatever He says about reality is an accurate representation of reality. Therefore, the statements in the Qur'ân, assuming they are God's direct words, cannot be on a par with man-made theories and conjectures which are, necessarily, imperfect. Of course, for those who maintain that the Qur'ân is God's revelation as reconstructed by the Prophet, as some Muslim scholars suggest, or maintain that the Qur'ân is constructed by Muhammad, as many non-Muslims (e.g. Orientalists) claim, each and every indicative/declarative sentence (statement/proposition) in the Qur'ân can be regarded as a conjecture/ theory. The important point, however, is that for both groups, i.e. those who regard the Qur'ân as the direct words of God, and those who regard it as the words of the Prophet, the only way to make sense of the content of the Qur'ân is to construct their own conjectures/interpretations about it. This way of constructing conjectures/interpretations to understand the Qur'ân is, by the way, the method of understanding each and every text, whether sacred or secular. The same method also, as was discussed earlier, is the only way to make sense of the book of nature. This is because 'all observations are theory- laden': whatever we observe, whether a text or a natural or social</page><page sequence="14">ļgg ALI PAYA phenomenon, can only be understood/comprehended by means of our theories. These theories, however, are at each stage, necessarily incomplete and in need of further refinement and development. Now, when it comes to particular objects of study, such as the Qur'an and nature, whose logical depths' are significant, the process of constructing ever-better conjectures to get closer to true representations of their reality will be a never-ending pursuit. At each stage of this journey, human beings use their best background knowledge, lived experiences, and technologies in order to construct conjectures which they hope would represent, more or less accurately, the realities under consideration. They then thoroughly examine these conjectures to expose their defects. Their hope is that in the course of this process, they learn through their own mistakes and from the mistakes of others and thus get prompted/inspired to construct yet better conjectures devoid of the shortcomings of the earlier conjectures. At this juncture, I would like to suggest, conjecturally, that the approach introduced by the critical rationalists to develop our knowledge about various aspects of reality (including the Qur'an) is one which the Qur'an also corroborates and endorses. The following example from Surah al-An'am shows this point in a rather interesting way.30 So We were showing Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and earth, that he might be of those having sure faith. When night outspread over him he saw a star and said, 'This is my Lord.' But when it set he said, 'I love not the setters.' When he saw the moon rising, he said, 'This is my Lord.' But when it set he said, 'If my Lord does not guide me I shall surely be of the people gone astray.' When he saw the sun rising, he said, 'This is my Lord; this is greater!' But when it set he said, 'O my people, surely I am quit of that you associate. I have turned my face to Him who originated the heavens and the earth, a man of pure faith; I am not of the idolaters.' [75-79] As the story clearly shows, Ibrahim (Abraham) in his quest to acquire knowledge about the Lord of the realm of being31 makes a series of conjectures 30 All the translations of the verses of the Qur'an are my own. However, these are based on the translations by Arberry, Pickthall, and Yusuf Ali. 31 Some commentators maintain that the whole episode was a play by Ibrahim to highlight the falsity of the beliefs of the idol-worshippers among his people Muhammad Husayn al-</page><page sequence="15">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'AN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE jgg and in each case critically tests his conjectures against reality. Each time, when he finds faults with his proposed conjecture he neither tries to dogmatically stick to it nor to make it immune to criticism by resorting to ad-hoc manoeuvring. On the contrary, he tries to replace it with a better conjecture. In the process, he learns from the mistakes of his earlier views and thus develops his knowledge via nogativa. In the end, his accumulated knowledge helped him to come up with a much better conjecture with regard to his quest/ problem: he realised that no perishable entity deserves to be regarded as the Lord of the realm of being and thus declared that the Lord can only be the One who has created this realm. To better appreciate the three ways in which the Qur'ân can assist inquirers with their intellectual engagement with the 'universe' of 'the human condition,' in what follows I have provided some examples, each about one of these three ways. Suppose, one's 'problem' is what is one's duty with regard to one's elderly parents. Again suppose the inquirer lives with his wife and children and his parents in a large city in which houses and apartments are small and cost of living is very high. Both the inquirer and his wife work (indeed both must work to make ends meet), their kids go to school, and they do not have the support network of the extended families found in traditional societies. Suppose after a great deal of deliberation and soul-searching the inquirer comes to conclusion that the best solution is to provide his parents with a minimum provision (what he can comfortably afford without putting pressure on the other members of his immediate family) and arrange for his parents to live in a separate place (perhaps in an elderly care home). As discussed earlier, as soon as a conjecture is being formulated it must be subjected to critical assessment in order to expose its possible defects. In the case of the above example, since the problem with which the inquirer is dealing is related to the category of 'the human condition' he can use the Qur'ân as a source for critical assessment of his proposed conjecture. Now, if after consultation with the Qur'ân (and also other sources) including the tradition of the Prophet and despite his best and most sincere efforts he could find no fault in his conjecture, then he can conclude that his proposed solution/ conjecture is, for the time being (and until a better solution/conjecture is proposed or in the light of new evidence it becomes clear that the proposed solution ought to be rejected) on the right track and he is rationally entitled to put it to work. On the other hand, if as a result of critical consultation with the Qur'ân (and other sources) the inquirer came to Tabataba'ī, Al-Mizan fi Tafśir al-Qur'an (Beirut: Mu'assasah al-A'laml lil Matbu'at) 7: 183. This interpretation does not invalidate the main point of the argument discussed in the text.</page><page sequence="16">Y)Q ali paya the conclusion that his proposed solution is rejected by the Qur'än (and/or other sources) he should try to come up with a better conjecture. It is important to bear in mind that in order to use the Qur'än in the capacity of a critical judge conjectures should be formulated in ways which make the exposure of their defects easy. In other words, our epistemic attitude must be to try, in the first instance, to refute our knowledge claims. However, if despite our best efforts to find faults in our conjectures they remained corroborated, we are entitled to (provisionally and until better conjectures are found and/or defects of our present conjectures are exposed) adopt them as our best knowledge about the issue under consideration. Conjectures must not be framed for the purpose of getting 'confirmation' from the Qur'än. Confirmation of our claims does not add to our knowledge. It only provides us with psychological assurance.32 The second way the Qur'än can help us with our knowledge pursuit is to act as a heuristic source for insight, inspiration and intuition with regard to possible solutions for problems (related to the category of 'the human condition') with which we are grappling. Here, one's intimate familiarity with the Qur'än can act (contingently, though not necessarily) as an aid and catalyst for the conception of novel visions in one's W2 in response to the problems one is diligently and methodically trying to solve. There are many examples of Muslim scholars who have been inspired by the Qur'än in finding clues and indications for the problems they were dealing with. A philosopher like Mullā Sadrā (1571-1640), a poet like Shams al-Dln Muhammad (aka Hafez) (1315-1390) and a mystic like Rūmi (1207-1273) are among a large number of Muslim thinkers whose intellectual works have been greatly inspired by their knowledge of the Qur'än and their intimate familiarity with this book. It must be emphasised that there is no rule or algorithm or procedure or set of guidelines which could be used to take one from the problems one is trying to solve to the required solutions (whether the problems in question are related to the category of 'the human condition' or the category of 'nature's problems.' Solutions can only 'emerge' in the shape of insights/ intuitions/visions in one's W2 under certain circumstances. The following four condition, are among the necessary, though unfortunately not sufficient conditions, for bringing about the required solutions. The first and most 32 The following example can help to make the issue clearer: suppose you have booked your air ticket to a certain destination and have received details of your flight. A day before the departure you contact the airlines and ask for confirmation of your flight details. Assuming that nothing is changed, what you get does not add to what you already knew about your flight details, it only provides you with psychological assurance.</page><page sequence="17">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'AN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE ļgļ important condition is to deal with the problems in question in a systematic manner. If one only haphazardly attends to the problems one intends to solve, one's chances will not be high for finding appropriate solutions.33 The second necessary condition is for one to be equipped with proper background- knowledge. For one who knows little about the problems, one intends to solve, achieving success would be highly improbable. The third necessary condition is that the general intellectual environment in which one resides and within which one is facing the problems in question must also be appropriately rich. To the combination of the above-mentioned factors, one should also add the element of luck/ chance (or God's grace and assistance). If all the above conditions are properly met, then the solution, in the shape of a conjecture, may (but only may) be found in the shape of a flash of insight, an epiphany, the light of an intuition, and so on. But there is no guarantee for a successful outcome even when all the above conditions are met.34 For one to be inspired by the Qur'ân with regard to the problems with which one is grappling, one needs to immerse oneself in the Qur'ân and approach it as if it is being revealed to one for the first time. It should be borne in mind that inspirations, insights, epiphanies and intuitions, must be reconstructed and then be submitted to the tribune of the 'Context of Assessment.' Since all such reconstructions are man-made, they are, necessarily, imperfect. Their imperfections can be exposed in the process of critical assessment. Apart from to the two ways described above in which the Qur'ân helps one in one's knowledge pursuit, there is also a third way in which the Qur'ân can play a role in developing one's knowledge. This last function of the Qur'ân is its assistance in suggesting (in the shape of intuition and insights) interesting problems to inquiring minds. Here, just like the case with the book of nature, those who approach the Qur'ân with an inquisitive and well- prepared mind are more likely to be struck by problems which the Qur'ân may present to them. A case in point is the question 'what is the nature of the revelation?' which quite a few scholars in the classic and modern periods have 33 This point needs further explanation to avoid possible misunderstanding. It is a well-known fact that sometimes in the course of dealing with a truly difficult problem, it is advisable that one gives oneself some break and take the conscious decision of putting the hard problem aside for a while and think of something quite different in order to give the sub-conscious parts of the brain a chance to get prepared for tackling the problem afresh at a later stage. But this conscious postponement of dealing with the problem is completely different from haphazard and un- systematic treatment of the problem. 34 The theorem proposed by the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat in 1637 and took 358 years to be solved in 1994, is a case in point (see, Simon Singh, Fermaťs Last Theorem (UK: Fourth Estate, 2002)).</page><page sequence="18">192 ALI PAYA tried to tackle.35 Another related question is how and why non-Arabic terms have appeared in the Qur'an?36 As an example of the three ways the Qur'an can help researchers, consider a particular case in the field of human rights. Suppose a Muslim legal expert intends to explore the issue of women's rights in Islam. The researcher's initial conjecture is that Islam has given equal rights to men and to women.37 He then consults the Qur'an and comes across the verses which discuss the notion of Milk al-Yamin ,38 (lit. what is possessed by the right hand) which refers to slaves or women who are captured in war. The researcher studies the views of the classic exegetes of the Qur'an about this notion and notes that they all interpret the verses in which the above concept appears in ways which would refute his initial conjecture. However, the researcher decides to delve deeper and further explore the issue under consideration by examining other verses in which the topics of rights, slavery, rules applicable to captives, and their ilk are discussed. Such a closer examination, as some scholars have argued, would result in the realisation that the classic exegetes had interpreted the verses in which the notion of 'Milk al-Yamin' is discussed in misleading ways which were incompatible with other verses in the Qur'an. Their interpretations of 'Milk al-Yamin' were tailor-made to suit the require- ments of a male-dominated society.39 From here the researcher may come to the conclusion that the issue of the male-dominated mentality of the classic exegetes needs a more comprehensive treatment with regard to their claims concerning other verses in the Qur'an. In the above example, the Qur'an has helped the researcher in the three different ways discussed above, namely, as a critical judge, as a source of inspiration and as a source for new problems.40 « 35 Abu Zaid, Mafhum' Soroush, "Mohammad." 36 Arthur Jeffery, The Foreign Vocabulary in the Qur'an , (Leiden: Brill, 2007); Christoph Luxenberg, The Syro- Aramie Reading of the Koran : A Contribution to the Decoding of the Koran (Berlin: Verlag Hans Schiler, 2007). 37 This scenario can be equally developed with the opposite assumption, i.e. the researcher's initial conjecture is that Islam has not given equal rights with men to women. 38 This example is based on an unpublished paper of Nehad Khanfar, "What your Right Hand Possesses: The Islamic Legal Concept of "Mulk al-Yamean" [sic.]. I should like to thank my colleague Dr Khanfar for providing me with a copy of his paper. 39 Ibid. 40 The discussion concerning the ways in which one may be able to benefit from studying the Qur'an is based on the assumption that one is equipped with the basic requirements of such a study. This includes a fair familiarity with Arabic language, competence in dealing with issues related to the human condition, a fair ability to develop tenable and contentful conjectures as solutions to issues one is concerned with and a good ability to critically assess them. The discussion in the text also implies the significance of a collective approach to the study of the Qur'an by a community of scholars.</page><page sequence="19">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'AN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE ļņļ Istintâq and the Approach of Critical Rationalists In the famous collection of sermons on fourth Muslim Caliph, 'All b. Abū Tälib. One sermon reads: It is the Qur'än. If you ask it to speak it won't do so, but I will tell you about it. Surely it contains knowledge of what is to come about, stories of the past, cure for your ills and regulation for whatever faces you.41 Qur'änic scholars refer to the above approach as the "Method of Istintâq" (interrogation, examination, inquest).'42 Perhaps among the contemporary interpreters of the Qur'än, Ayatollah Muhammad Bäqir Sadr, is the most prominent Shi'I scholar who has discussed the method of Istintâq and has used it in his own studies of the Qur'än.43 Sadr explains that "the dominant method of the interpretation [of the Qur'än] in the past thirteen centuries has been ... to interpret the Quran verse by verse."44 Interpretation of the Qur'än in a verse by verse manner and by following the existing arrangement of chapters and verses of the Qur'än is called 'taf sir tartlbl' (sequential interpretation). In the twentieth century, Muslim scholars developed another approach to the interpretation of the Qur'än which is called 'tafslr Mawdu'I (thematic interpretation). Sadr is among modern Muslim scholars who have applied this particular method to the interpretation of the Qur'än. In his view, in this method 'contrary to the sequential method, the interpreter begins his interpretation by . . . directing his gaze and thought towards one of the doctrinal, social or other types of human problems. He then considers all the verses relevant to the topic in question and ask questions and gets replies from the Qur'än.'45 One of the most important aspects of the approach of Sadr to the Qur'än is the application of the concept terminology employed by 'Ali, calls Istintâq (interrogation) of the Qur'än. He suggests that in Istintâq: [F]irst of all, the thematic interpreter only relies upon the word of God, and nothing else, for getting an answer. Secondly, the objective of this approach, contrary to the approach of the sequential interpreter, is gleaning an answer [to a 41 'Ali b. Abi Talib, Nahj al-Balaghah, ed. Subhl al-Salih (Cairo: Dar al-Kitab al-Misri, 2004) 223. 42 Sayyid Muhammad Baqir Sadr, Al-Madrasah al-Qur'aniyyah [The School of the Qur'an], (Tehran: Dār al-Kitāb al-Islamī, 2003). 43 Ibid., 'All Asghar Yasaqi and Sayyid Muhammad 'All AyazI, "Tahlll-i Mabanl va Royakard Shahld Sadr bah Tafsīr-i Mavžū'i" Faslnāma-i Fiqh wa Ta'rïkh-i Tamaddun , No. 6, 25 (2010): 196-217. 44 Sadr, 2003: 90, quoted in Yasaghi, and Ayazi, 2010: 198. 45 Sadr al-Madrasah al-Qur'aniyyah , 18; Yasaghi and Ayazi, "Analysis of the Principles," 200-201.</page><page sequence="20">j 94 ALI PAYA question] out of the Qur'an. This element, i.e. interrogation of the Qur'an constitutes another characteristic which distinguishes the thematic interpretation from the sequential interpretation. That [characteristic] is this; the interpreter in the sequential method has a passive and negative approach. That is to say, the sequential interpreter, studies, without any pre-plan, one or few verses which belong to the same passage and tries to understand the significations and entailments of the verses in question in the light of the meaning of the terms which appear in them. This is an interpretation based on the apparent meaning of the text. ...; [T]he thematic interpreter, however, has an active approach. His encounter with the Qur'an is based on interrogation. This is because before consulting the Qur'an he concentrates on a particular topic concerning human life and makes himself familiar with man-made solutions and ideas about those topics. For this reason, when he studies the Qur'an with such a background knowledge he is nó longer a mere listener and reporter of something for which he has not made any effort. Rather, he interrogates the Qur'an in the light of the knowledge he has already acquired with regard to topic (s) in question and enters into a dialogue with the text and its interrogation. The interpreter asks, one by one, [his questions] and the Qur'an answers [them]."46 Other writers who have discussed the method of Istintaq all concur that the core element of this method is to put questions to the Qur'an and get the answers for those questions from the Qur'an. Thus for example, a group of scholars at the Department of Theology at Tehran University in a joint paper titled, "Interrogation (Istintaq) of the Qur'an"47 state that: "Interrogation of the Qur'an means to put questions to the Qur'an and ask it to answer them." Similarly, Ayatollah Sadigl, an Iranian cleric, describes the method of Istintaq in the following way The Qur'ân's ability to talk has two dimensions. The first is that the Quranic terms and phrases have the highest miraculous degree of ability to convey the intended concepts and significations with regard to the duties of the duty-bound [believers]. The second is that when the Qur'an talks about a particular signification, to understand it, one must refer to the Qur'an itself and ask it to talk and clarify the meaning of that signification. ... Istintaq and Istifsār (asking for interpretation) mean requesting the speech and clarification [from something]. That is to say, a request for understanding and learning about the meaning of a subject through intellectual endeavour and deep thinking. And as we had already explained, the Qur'an is its own interpreter and spokesperson. If interrogation of the Qur'an is mixed with the inquirer's preconceptions and pre- knowledge, they act as a misleading veil with regard to the understanding of the 46 Yasaghi and Ayazi, "Analysis of the Principles/' 203; emphasis added. 47 Husayn Safrah, Majīd Ma'arif and Mansur Pahalvan, "Istintaq-e Qur'an," Pizohash ha e Qur'an wa Hadith 43, no. 1 (2010): 139.</page><page sequence="21">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'AN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE J95 Qur'an's speech and the Qur'an's absolute interpretation of itself. We must solely try to find and understand the meaning of the Qur'ânic terms and interpretation of the Qur'ânic verses by means of the Qur'an alone. If we found the true meanings of the Qur'ânic terms, then it means the Qur'an has spoken to us.48 Another aspect of Sadr's approach to the Qur'an is his emphasis on the importance of extracting theories concerning the topics the interpreter is researching on from within the Qur'an. He suggests that the thematic interpretation only takes shape when the view of Islam and the Qur'an with regard to the topics [under the investigation] and objective realities of the society is extracted from within the Qur'an.49 Even a quick comparison between what was discussed earlier with the above reveals the shortcomings of the model developed by Sadr and others who have tried to introduce a new approach to the Qur'an which is, allegedly, based on All's method of Istintäq. It is the contention of this paper that All's method is akin to the critical rationalist approach. The approach of Ayatollah Sadr and other thematic interpreters who have argued that the method of Istintäq is based on putting questions to the Qur'an and asking for answers from it, suffers from some serious defects which cannot be attributed to the method of 'Ali. Apparently, the thematic interpreters think that the Qur'an contains theories and formulated solutions, with regard to the topics under investigation, which can be discovered or extracted from the Qur'an. But this view is based on mistaken methodological and epistemological models akin to the models developed by positivists and their rivals phenomenologists and hermeneutists (collectively known as culturalists). Positivists are of the view that we can find hypotheses by means of observation and induction. They suggest that if we approach our objects of inquiry with a mind cleansed from all pre-conceptions and pre-knowledge and prejudices we will be able to 'see' patterns in phenomena and these patterns would lead us to hypotheses about phenomena.50 Phenomenologists, who, by the way, would regard 48 Nur al-Huda, "Istintäq az Qur'an," (http://fariba9999.blocfa.com/post/875/ 49 Sadr, al-Madresa al-Quraniyah, 14-15; discussed in Yasaghi and Ay azi, "Analysis of the Principles," 206. 50 Frederick Suppe, ed., The Structure of Scientific Theories (Illinois: University of Illinois Press, 1977).</page><page sequence="22">296 ALI PAYA 'Phenomenology as genuine positivism,'51 maintain that they can get to know the essence of things.52 To do this, one only needs to apply the methods of 'epoche' and 'bracketing,' and get rid of all 'theories' to make sure that one only describes faithfully and without distortion what appears before one. Now, both positivists and phenomenologists have, in my view, failed to appreciate that 'all observations are theory-laden.' It is in the light of our prior theories/conjectures/expectations that we 'see' things.53 Hermeneutists have made a mistake of another type. They claim that what they call 'understanding' is different from 'explanation.' The former is subjective whereas the latter is objective.54 However, subjective 'interpretation' of the meaning of texts/events would not in itself amount to the development of knowledge; in the absence of objective criteria for assessing claims, epistemological relativism and the attitude of 'anything goes' would prevail. In the light of the above, it is not difficult to see why Sadr's view (and the views of his fellow thematic interpreters) that the thematic interpreters must ask the Qur'ân to answer their questions and must find theories in the Qur'ân, is not correct. Theories arc constructed by us in response to the challenges introduced to us by reality. The reality, whether of a text or of nature, can only act as referee and judge for our theories/ conjectures. As explained earlier, no theory can be found in the Qur'ân. Even if there are 'theories' in the Qur'ân they can only be understood through our own interpretations which are inevitably imperfect. Moreover, since all observations and understandings are theory-laden, there is no such a thing as 'literal understanding': even the strictest literal understanding of the Qur'ân is tainted by the readers' interpretation. When reading the Qur'ân, or any other text, we only project/ present our conjectures/theories to the Qur'ân. The Qur'ân does not provide us with direct answers to our Questions. In the same way that nature does not provide us with theories or answers. However, reality, whether of a text or nature, can highlight our mistakes. Another point with respect to the comments made by the advocates of the quizzing account of Istintaq is that approaching the Qur'ân with a mind cleansed from all pre-knowledge, as Sadoql would suggest, cannot help us to 51 Edmund Husserl, Ideas : General Introduction to Pure Phenomenology , trans.

A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE understand the Qur'ân. It is impossible to learn/understand anything if one turns one's mind into a tabula rasa or a blank slate.55 At the end of this section, two related points need to be addressed. First, how the proposed method compares with the method of " tafslr al-Qur'an bi 7 Qur'ân " (interpretation of the Qur'ân by the Qur'ân) used by a number of commentators including Tabātabā'ī in his Al-Mīzān ? And secondly if as was suggested above one cannot (and should not) expect to get direct answers to one's question from the Qur'ân, then how come the tradition of Divination or omen (istikhārah) has been well-established and long standing in many Muslim societies for centuries? Since I have discussed the method of interpretation of the Qur'ân by the Qur'ân elsewhere,56 1 shall only deal with the second. To answer the above objection one needs to make a distinction between 'decision-making' and the process that leads to decision-making. The former is a type of action and therefore cannot be regarded as either rational or irrational. Rationality only belongs to the realm of reason and arguments. When it comes to decision-making, the process which leads to making a decision could be rational. Here, one rationally and critically weighs the arguments and evidence for and against a decision and opts for the one which fares better with the rational arguments. At the same time, the process of decision-making could be irrational: one can toss a coin to come to a decision. Those who use the Qur'ân for the purpose of Divination and omen if they ponder upon the verses and try to develop some conjectures based on the illumination and insight they may receive from their serious studying of the Qur'ân, then they could use the information they have gleaned from the Qur'ân to rationally assess the options before them. In other words, they do not expect something over and above the usages of the Qur'ân. However, if they just, as is customary, just open the Qur'ân and look at the first verse on the top of the page on the right-hand side (in Arabic format) or the one on the top of the page on the left-hand side (in the English format) and regard it as a 'yes' or 'no' or a 'good' or 'bad,' then apparently they appear to be reducing the use of the Qur'ân to the status of coin-tossing exercise. Zann (Conjecture) and Yaqin (Certainty) in the Qur'an: Is Critical Rationalism Incompatible with the Teachings of the Qur'an In this section, I briefly deal with two possible, and seemingly serious, objections to the epistemologica! approach developed by critical rationalists. 55 Popper, Myth. 56 Ali Paya, "A Critical Assessment of Allameh Tabatabaee's Methodological Approach and Methods of Interpretation in His Magnum Opus, Tafsir al-Mizah from a Critical Rationalist Point of View" (forthcoming)</page><page sequence="24">19g ALI PAYA As was noted above critical rationalism maintains that all knowledge is conjectural and forever remains conjectural.57 Moreover, it emphasises that certainty belongs to the realm of personal psychology and is not an epistemological category. On the other hand, those who are familiar with the verses of the Qur'an are aware of the existence of many verses in which the notion of zann (conjecture) is discussed and is repudiated as an epistemologically unsafe concept. At the same time, it seems the Qur'an attributes a great deal of value to certainty yaqin . If you obey the most of those on earth they would mislead you far from the path of God; they follow not but surmise (zann), and do not but guess [al-An'ām: 116]. And the most of them follow only conjecture (zann), and conjecture avails naught against truth. Surely God knows the things they do. [Yünus: 36] And worship your Lord until certainty [yaqin] comes to you [al-Hijr: 99]. No indeed; did you know with the knowledge of certainty [yaqin], you shall surely see Hell; Again, you shall surely see it with the eye of certainty [al- Takāthur: 5-7]. Surely this is the truth of certainty [yaqin] [al-Wāqi'ah: 95]. With regard to the above possible objections, the most straightforward answer is the familiar cliche that, 'appearances can be deceptive.' Closer inspection of the verses in which the term zann has been used makes it amply clear that whenever this term, or one of its cognates, is used in a negative sense, it means those beliefs or views which have been embraced, adopted, accepted without proper critical examination and assessment.58 On the other hand, in other verses of Qur'an this term is used in a positive or neutral sense,59 it is clear that the Qur'an does not repudiate it. For example: 57 Knowledge claims which tell us something positive about reality are provisional; they will be upheld until a better conjecture replace them. 58 For example Qur'an while negating those who claimed that they had killed Jesus reads: [A]nd for their saying, 'We killed Christ, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger of God'- Neither they slew him, Nothey crucified him, only a likeness of that was shown to them. Those who are at variance concerning him surely are in doubt regarding him; they have no knowledge of him, except the following of surmise [zann] [al-Nisā': 157]. I think [conjecture] not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort. [al-Kahf: 36]. Behold! surely to God belongs everyone that is in the heavens and in the earth; they follow, who call upon associates, apart from God- they follow nothing but surmise, merely conjecturing. (Yünus: 66) 59 Sad: 24, al-Tawbah: 118.</page><page sequence="25">WHAT AND HOW CAN WE LEARN FROM THE QUR'ÂN? A CRITICAL RATIONALIST PERSPECTIVE ļgg who reckon [conjecture] that they shall meet their Lord and that unto Him they are returning. [Al-Baqarah:46] Then he said to the one he deemed [conjectured] should be saved of the two, 'Mention me in thy lord's presence.' But Satan caused him to forget to mention him to his master, so that he continued in the prison for certain years. [Yūsuf:42] The Qur'ân does not suggest that all the conjectures are blameworthy rather it clearly states that only some of these are blameworthy [F]or, behold, some conjectures (suspicion) are sinful [al-Hujrāt: 12]. In other words, it seems wherever the term zann and its possible cognates are used in the sense of 'unexamined knowledge claims,' the Qur'ân rejects it as something which causes misunderstanding or misconduct. This usage of the term is, however, different from the meaning of conjecture as 'knowledge' and not mere 'knowledge claim' used by the critical rationalists. For critical rationalists, as discussed above, all conjectures must be submitted to the most diligent critical assessments. Those conjectures which fail in this examination are rejected. But they still teach us something about reality, albeit via negativa. Others which remain corroborated are regarded as positive knowledge claim but only provisionally. With regard to those verses in which the term yaqin (certainty) is used, it is clear that, the certainty the Qur'ân is referring to always remains personal, albeit, its degree of intensity is different in the three cases of (ilm al-yaqin (which refers to a theoretical/conceptual knowledge of the object of inquiry), (ayn al-yaqin (which refers to direct intuition of the object of inquiry) and haqq al-yaqin (which refers to an existential unification between the subject and the object of inquiry). The Qur'ânic concept of yaqin can be better understood in the context of other verses of the Qur'ân, including the following, When Abraham said: "Show me, Lord, how You will raise the dead, "He replied: "Have you no faith?" He said, "Yes, but just to reassure my heart." [al- Baqarah: 226] Another Qur'ânic point which sheds further light on the above is a general instruction for believers that they should never cease to strive in their quest to getting closer to God, intellectually and otherwise. Thus, for example, the faithful are reminded that: Therefore, when you are free (from your immediate task), still labour hard [al- Inshārah: 7].</page><page sequence="26">2QQ ali paya Although, this verse is, in the first instance, directed towards the Prophet Muhammad, but given the fact that the Prophet is the best role-model for the faithful, what is expected of him, is, to some extent, expected of all the faithful. This being the case, it in line with it corroborates yet another aspect of critical rationalism, namely, the point that our quest for acquiring knowledge should be regarded as a never-ending process: we should always try hard to expose the defects of our conjectures in a bid to learn from our mistakes and from the mistakes of others. However, as soon the shortcomings of our present conjectures are exposed, and as a result we not only obtained some sort of knowledge with respect to the problems we were dealing with but perhaps also a degree of certainty, we must immediately embark upon developing new conjectures in the light of the new problems with which we have encountered and the new knowledge we have acquired. Through this process of developing our knowledge, we also move on to higher planes of certainty. In other words, certainty, as introduced in the Qur'an, refers to temporary stages from which we must continuously ascend towards higher stages. Conclusion Critical rationalism presents a fruitful approach to the use of the Qur'an as a source of knowledge which complements the 'book' of nature. This approach suggests that the Qur'an can help us in our knowledge pursuits with regard to a particular category of problems collectively known as 'the human condition.' In the first place, it can act as a judge in assisting us to critically assess our conjectures. Here, the way we formulate our conjectures, for the purpose of consulting the Qur'an, is important. Secondly, the Qur'an can act as a heuristic source for developing conjectures as possible solutions for the problems with which we are grappling. And, thirdly, the Qur'an can, again in a heuristic way, suggests new problems and challenges to those who approach it with a mind rich with ideas. It was further argued that the method of Istintäq discussed by 'All is different from what has been suggested by a number of contemporary scholars; it is closer to the method introduced by the critical rationalist. ® ® $</page></plain_text>
