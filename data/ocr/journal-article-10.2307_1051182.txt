<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DOCTRINE OF JIHAD: AN INTRODUCTION Noor Mohammad* There is a great deal of confusion in the West regarding the meaning of Jihad and the role it is playing in shaping the Muslim world. Indeed, it has acquired a pejorative connotation in the minds of many Westerners. The purpose of this discussion is to present an accurate understanding of the concept of Jihad. Islam emerged in the seventh century in Arabia. It grew rapidly and in less than a hundred years established the early Islamic state- an empire stretching from Spain across North Africa, and from the Middle East to the borders of China. It was a state greater in size than the Roman Empire at its zenith.1 The historical importance assigned to Islam has been controver- sially assessed. Some have denied that it is a significant world force, others have "grudgingly" recognized its importance while others have seen it as a pivotal event in world history.2 We take this latter view: Islam should be recognized as a major force of revolutionary change in the world order. Harold Berman, a contemporary commentator on law and revolution in the west, gives a list of six revolutions which changed the Western world. He provides a helpful list of patterns which emerged from those revolutions which he identifies as funda- mental change, rapid change, violent change, lasting change, and change in the whole social system.3 Each revolution sought a legiti- macy in fundamental law, a remote past, and an apocalyptic future. Each took more than one generation to establish its roots. Each even- tually produced a new system of law which embodied some of the major purposes of the revolution and which changed the Western legal tradition, without destroying it. The appearance of Islam in the seventh century meets these criteria. Using Berman's framwork Is- lam can be viewed as truly revolutionary. * Professor of Law, University of Baltimore School of Law, Baltimore, Maryland. 1.

Islam which identifies Abraham, Moses, and Jesus as Islamic figures because of their mono- theistic teachings, was completed in the seventh century by the Prophet Muhammad.4 During this period, Mecca, which was to be- come the holy city of Islam, was a trade center and place of pilgrim- age. The religious importance of Mecca was due to the Kaaba landmark place of worship set up by the Prophet Abraham-the bearer of monotheism. In the long period that followed Abraham, monotheism was supplanted by paganism and idol worship-a period known as the dark age (Jahiliyya) in the history of Mecca as well as Arabia. Muhammad grew up against this backdrop. At age forty, Muhammad announced his divinely revealed mis- sion as the Prophet.5 The divine revelation which he received di- rected him to exhort his people against paganism, idol worship, and other social ills. They were recorded, preserved, and today constitute the Islamic scripture-the Quran. (The Quran includes previous rev- elations received by earlier prophets as well as this final religious reve- lation of Allah to Muhammad.) Muhammad's ministry lasted twenty-three years, during which time he founded a religion, a nation, and a state. Islam teaches belief in one Transcendent God (Allah), Resurrec- tion, and the last Judgment.6 In the scheme of things, under which God (Allah) created this world and all life within it, human beings were required to live a life of righteousness as preparation for the next world and accountability on the day of last judgment.7 It is in the 4. The name Muhammad is also spelled in Anglicized form as Mohammad, Mohammed, Mehemet, or Mohamad, etc. 5. According to biographers, Muhammad would retire for meditation during the months of Ramadan in the nearby hill known as the Mountain of Light. In the fifth year of retreat an angel came and announced to him that God (Allah) had chosen him as God's Messenger to all humanity. See M. H. HAYKAL, LIFE OF MUHAMMAD (1976); M. LINGS, MOHAMMAD, HIS LIFE BASED ON THE EARLIEST SOURCES (1983); M. HAMIDULLAH, INTRODUCTION TO IS- LAM (1977). 6. M. HAMIDULLAH, supra note 5, at 9. 7. M. ASSAD, ISLAM AT THE CROSSROADS 19-20 (1982). He explains this point with clarity by citing from the Quran, "I have not created the invisible being and mankind to any end other than that they may (know and) worship me" (Surah 51:56). Thus, the conception of "worship" in Islam is not restricted to the purely devotional practices, for example, prayers or fasting, but extends over the whole of man's practical life as well. If the object of our life as a whole is to be the worship of God, we must necessarily regard this life, in the totality of all its aspects, as one complex moral responsibility. Thus, all our actions, even the seemingly trivial ones must be performed as acts of worship; that is, 382 [Vol. 3</page><page sequence="3">JIHAD mediating of the life of this world for the other world that Islam sees itself departing radically from Christianity for Islam believes that the mediator is righteousness as spelled out in the Quran, and hence the mediator is the Quran itself. (The place of the Quran in Islam is roughly parallel to the role of Christ in orthodox Christianity.) In its theology the Quran rejects the anthropomorphic concept of God and places Muhammad in the role of a Messenger of God along with such figures as Jesus, Moses, and Abraham. To become a Muslim one must affirm the Shahada (testimonial) "La-Illah-il lallah-Mohammad ur-Rasul-Allah" ("there is no god but God (Allah) and Muhammad is the Prophet"). The Islamic concept of God (Allah) is critical and central to Islamic faith. Islam believes in the absolute Oneness or Unity of God (Allah). God (Allah) is Transcendent, Omnipresent, and Omnipotent. The concept of Tawhid or the Unity of God (Allah) needs to be explained here. The Unity or Oneness of God (Allah) carries with it the idea that God is without an associate. Islam condemns as the gravest of errors associating a creature with God (Allah) (shirk). The reason for this is that no living being should claim to embody the moral law or in any way claim to be divine.8 Another far reaching result flows from the concept of the unity of God. This belief frees people from all superstitions and directs them to fear none except one power; i.e. God (Allah), the Creator of all, and to be ultimately an- swerable to Him only. Tawhid bestows upon the individual indepen- dence from all other trappings of authority and compels a revolt against all humiliating forces of fear and greed.9 The Quran tells us that God sent a revelation to the Prophet to carry God's message to the people.10 These revelations continued through the life of the Prophet, and exhorted him to action. The Quran spells out general principles of humanitarianism, egalitarian- ism, social justice, economic justice, righteousness, and solidarity, as necessary to well-being in this world and well-being in the hereafter."1 The Quran is not a law book in the narrow sense of that term. It does performed consciously as constituting a part of God's universal plan. For the person of aver- age capability this is a distant ideal; but nevertheless one to be sought. 8. F.

After Muhammad, the Quranic principles were followed and applied by his successors, the first four Caliphs, who are described as "the rightly guided." What distinguishes this era for the Muslims is the belief that in this period Islam was practiced in its pristine purity. The principles and the practices followed by Muslims in this era are known as the Sharia. The term Sharia means the "highway to good life"'3; i.e., reli- gious values, expressed functionally and in concrete terms. The sources of the Sharia ranked in order are 1) the Quran and 2) Sunna; i.e., the practices of the Prophet 3) Qiyas; i.e., analogical reasoning and 4) Ijma; i.e., consensus of Islamic community on a point of law. According to Sharia, the sovereignty resides in God (Allah), thus the organs of the state have to act within the limits of the divine law, i.e., Sharia. This sovereignty is recognized by incorporation of Sharia in an Islamic community or state. In this sense Sharia is the constitu- tional law of a Muslim society. In the Western world such sover- eignty is often attributed to the members of the community or to the state itself. Based on these underlying concepts, Islam created a new spiritu- ally inspired legal order which replaced the existing order. These defi- nitions and beliefs form the background for the discussion of Jihad. DOCTRINE OF JIHAD-EARLY DEVELOPMENT Jihad is frequently confused with the current Western concept of secular war. It is an erroneous identification, for under Islamic doc- trine secular war (Harb) is morally unacceptable.14 Early Muslim thinkers equated such war with forms of social sickness. The Muslim scholar Ibn-Khaldun (A.D. 1332-1406) observed that wars had ex- isted from the beginning of human society and were rooted in human- ity's vengeful nature. Hence, Muslim scholars regarded secular wars as an evil which violated the divine laws and should be condemned. Islam permits only Jihad and not Harb (secular war). The Islamic concept of the unity of God was taught by the Prophet against the backdrop of the polytheistic, pagan society of 12. ESPOSITO, supra note 1, at 17. 13. F.

This helps explain the word Jihad. Jihad means struggle or exertion of one's power in Allah's path15 against that which is evil; its goal is to destroy evil, to spread belief in Allah and to make His words supreme in this world. During his years in Mecca the Prophet's polit- ical power was not strong, yet he was exhorted to propagate the message of Islam against the prevalent idolatry and paganism. In this period obviously Jihad meant only the propagation of Islam. The verses of the Quran dealing with Jihad in this period state: And strive in His cause As ye ought to strive (with sincerity and under discipline) (Sura XXII, 78) Yusuf Ali, in his widely respected commentary on the Quran, says that these words dealing with Jihad are perfectly general and apply to all true and unselfish striving for spiritual good.16 Another verse gives a similar meaning to the term Jihad: Therefore listen not To the Unbelievers, but strive Against them with the utmost strenuousness with the Quran Sura XXV, 52 A verse in Sura IX, 20 to 22 deal with the subject in a particular context: Those who believe, and suffer Exile and strive with might And main, in God's cause with their goods and their persons Have the highest rank in the sight of God They are the people Who will achieve salvation Yusuf Ali describes this verse as a good description of Jihad. 15.

Mere brutal fighting is opposed to the whole spirit of Jihad, while the sincere scholar's pen or preacher's voice or wealthy man's contribution may be the most valuable form of Jihad." The verses dealing with fighting or war known as Jihad need to be mentioned here.18 Fight in the cause of God Those who fight you, But do not transgress limits; For God loveth not transgressors. And slay them Wherever ye catch them And turn them out From where they have Turned you out; For tumult and oppression Are worse than slaughter; But fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, Unless they (first) Fight you there; But if they fight you, Slay them. Such is reward Of those who suppress faith. But if they cease, God is oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. And fight them on Until there is no more 17. Id. at note 1270. 18. THE HOLY QURAN S-XI, 191-195.

And spend of your substance In the cause of God, And make not your own hands Contribute to (your) destruction; But do good; For God loveth those Who do good. This verse belongs to the Medina period. By this time Muslims had become a political community through their development of the city state of Medina under Muhammad, their leader (Imam). Their concern in this period was primarily with their right to practice their faith without persecution from the pagans of Mecca. The verse tells the Muslims that forcible prevention of religious practice amounts to declaration of war on Islam and exhorts Muslims to meet the chal- lenge with valor. Yusuf Ali explains the verse by pointing out that though it may be said that Islam is the religion of peace, goodwill, mutual understanding, and good faith, it will not acquiesce in wrong- doing. Its men will hold their lives cheap in defense of honor, justice, and the religion they hold sacred. The Islamic ideal, as Yusuf Ali 381] 387</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF LAW &amp; RELIGION explains, is that of heroic virtue combined with unselfish gentleness and tenderness as exemplified in the life of Muhammad. Muslims be- lieve in courage, obedience, discipline, duty, and a constant striving by all the means in their power for the establishment of truth and righteousness. They know that war is an evil, but they will not avoid it if their honor demands it and a righteous Imam commands it. In other cases war may have nothing to do with their faith, except that it will always be regulated by Islam's humane precepts.19 Yet, another verse directed against the pagan polytheists of Mecca calls for Jihad against them. (Sura XXI, 39 &amp; 40) To those against whom War is made, permission Is given (to fight), because They are wronged; - and verily, God is Most Powerful For their aid;- (They are) those who have Been expelled from their homes In defiance of right,- (For no cause) except That they say, "Our Lord Is God," Did not God Check one set of people By means of another, There would surely have been Pulled down monasteries, churches Synagogues, and mosques, in which The name of God is commemorated. Asad, another distinguished authority, points out that these two verses on Jihad attest to the fundamental principles of self defense against aggression and make war morally justifiable.20 This defense of political and spiritual freedom is enjoined upon Muslims and must be accorded to Jews and Christians who fall under Muslim polity. The Quran in numerous verses circumscribes Jihad by permit- 19. Y. ALI, supra note 16, footnote 205. 20. M. ASSAD, supra note 15, at 71. 388 [Vol. 3</page><page sequence="9">JIHAD ting war only against pagans or polytheists whose faith and practices are directly in conflict with the messages of Allah given through Muhammad. In addition to the Quran, the subject of Jihad is covered in detail in the Hadith. The term Hadith means a narration or a report which tells what the Prophet said, did, and approved or disapproved. Hadith, therefore, is a main source of Sunna; i.e., the tradition or practices laid down by the Prophet.21 One such collection of Hadith, that of Imam Bukhari, treats various aspects of Jihad.22 We may now look at the main theme of Jihad. The term as seen above means exertion or struggle. But this struggle or exertion is not limited to the battlefield. Muslim jurists have spelled out four ways to perform the Jihad obligation. These are: 1) by heart, 2) by tongue, 3) by the mind, and 4) by the sword.23 The first deals with the devil in oneself. The Prophet Muham- mad regarded this obligation of Jihad as the greatest for it requires one's self-control or restraint. The second and third obligations deal with supporting right and correcting wrong. The fourth obligation is equivalent to war and is most concerned with fighting pagans and polytheists, war waged in the way of God (Allah).24 It must be stated that in the classical sense the concept of Jihad was inapplicable with full force against the people of the Book of Scriptures (Ahl-al-Kitab).25 This group comprised Jews, Christians, and Sabians who believed in (God) Allah. But this group according to the Quranic revelation followed a distorted message, and was, therefore, subject to a moderated form of Jihad, although unlike the degree of intensity applied to polytheists. Polytheists were invited to embrace Islam or challenged to fight. But the people of the Book on the other hand were invited to embrace Islam or pay the Jazia (poll tax) in order to remain members under Muslim polity and freely prac- tice their faith.26 The poll tax option developed gradually after the celebrated Charter of Medina, under which Jews were accorded reli- 21. As previously stated, Sunna is a component of Sharia, the Law of Muslim society. 22. 4 SAHIH-AL-BUKHARI 34-204.

Jihad is categorized as a collective28 as opposed to individual duty. It raises the question as to who declares the Call of Jihad, i.e., the public or the government. In its classical interpretation it was left to the Imam or Caliph who was the head of Muslim polity to declare Jihad.29 Jihad under Islam is also a religious act and hence subject to the rules spelled out by the Prophet and his successor Caliphs. The Prophet upon appointing a commander over an army would instruct him to fear God (Allah) in relationship to himself and the treatment of the soldiers. Then he would say: "Fight in the name of God (Al- lah) and in the path of God (Allah); do not cheat, do not break trust, do not mutilate, do not kill minors."30 Abu Bakr,31 the successor of the Prophets and Umar,32 the second Caliph, gave similar messages to the men who were undertaking a mission. After the Prophet, Abu Bakr became the first Caliph and head of the Islamic State. He soon faced tribal uprisings in violation of the M. HAMIDULLAH, ISLAMIC CONDUCT OF STATE 111-18; and S. MAUDOODI, THE ISI AMIC LAW &amp; CONSTITUTION 255-79 (1969). Acceptance by the People of the Book to remain in Muslim polity placed them in the category known as Dhimmis. The term originates from Dhimmat Allah (God's custody). In today's context of constitutional government the term Dhimmis may have a ring of second class citizenship but if we turn the clock back and look at the concept, we will find that Dhimmi was given both legal and political protection. The relations between Muslim and non- Muslim communities were regulated by the special agreement between the parties under which the non-Muslims were permitted to worship and be governed by their own religious laws and leaders and were protected by the State both from internal and external attack. Because of the Dhimmas' special status, they were exempt from the obligations of Jihad and also from the payment of Zahat (poor tax), both of which were applied to Muslims. In a sense Jizia (poll tax) was in lieu of obligations of Zakat (poor tax) and Jihad which Muslims had to bear. There is a belief among some scholars that the exemption from Zakat (poor tax) and also from Islamic Law against usury together worked to the advantage of Dhimmis and kept their comparative tax burden lighter than that of Muslims. Despite the historical virtues of the concept of Dhimmi, it is believed that in a modern Muslim polity the concept will disappear and all citizens will be equal to each other in view of the basic concept of human equality regardless of color or sex. 27.

Abu Bakr launched what is known as riddah (apostacy) war.33 Apostacy in Islamic polity is analogous to treason because the society is based on the religious ideals of the Quran. Anyone renouncing the faith while remaining within the Islamic polity is equivalent to one who is a traitor. Thus, the concept of Jihad was expanded to include fighting against apos- tacy.34 In addition, the doctrine was also applied to suppress the re- bellion by Muslims against the ruling Imam. Thus, the principle of Jihad besides its original meaning now included two additional ideas; i.e., 1) Jihad against Apostacy and 2) Jihad against rebellion by Mus- lims against the ruling Imam. According to the Sunni interpretation of Islam the Prophet died without defining a process of succession or naming a successor.35 The first Caliph Abu Bakr (632-634), however, was elected by the Com- munity of Muslims. He, in turn, designated Umar to succeed him. Caliph Umar (634-644), set up an "electoral committee" to select his successor. He was succeeded by Uttman (644-656), through a process of consultation. He was followed by Ali (655-661). Ali's period was marred by internal strife and revolt by Muawiyah, the governor of Syria. It ended when Ali was assassinated by a rebel, leaving Muawiyah to take over the Caliphate. Thus ended the era known as the golden age of rightly-guided Islamic rule. Muawiyah36 set up his regime in 661 with Damascus as the capi- tal instead of Medina. He was a man with tremendous political skill which enabled him to establish the first Arabic Empire. However, he instituted an hereditary monarchy in place of the system of selection- election practiced by the earlier Caliph. The period 661-750, during which he and his successors ruled, is designated as the Ummayad's era. Gradually the Muslim resentment continued to build against the Ummayad's un-Islamic practices and failure to implement Sharia; i.e., the system of Islamic governnance and social justice. The Um- mayad's were overthrown in 750 A.D. The Ummayad's were replaced by the Abbasid or descendants of the Prophet's uncle, al-Abbas.37 They remained in place as Caliphs 33. F.

This period is regarded as a golden era for the development of the Sharia by the committed and scholarly efforts of Muslim jurists (Ulema) to fulfill the need to establish clearly the standards of Islamic ideal and man- date. These scholars were motivated by the Islamic belief that one should live by divinely ordained standards. Their efforts generated Islamic jurisprudence based on the Quran, the Sunna, and other sources of law. Thus, Islamic law is as much a system of ethics as it is of law, for it is concerned with what the Muslim "ought" or "ought not" to do. To violate the law is not only to risk punishment by the temporal authorities but also to be held accountable in the hereafter because Sharia is viewed in Islam as divine and not man made. Thus, all acts are categorized as: 1) obligatory, 2) recommended, 3) indiffer- ent or permissible, 4) reprehensible, 5) forbidden or prohibited. In the tenth century Muslim jurists concluded that the divine laws had been fully compiled. To prevent further tampering and tink- ering with these laws they also concluded that the doors of further interpretations of the Sharia were finally closed. One further observation regarding Jihad and the development of the doctrine during the era of the Ummayads and the Abbasis is im- portant to our discussion. With the expansion of Islam over three continents; i.e. Europe, Africa, and Asia, another juristic concept de- veloped which divided the world between Dar-ul-Islam (Muslim Ter- ritory) and Dar-ul-Harb (Enemy Territory). But with this expansion which moved the Muslim domain beyond its capacity to govern, the need for waging active Jihad against non-Islamic areas was no longer considered a priority. Active Jihad was, therefore, dormant in this period replaced by struggle through nonviolent means. Ibn Khaldun believes that the relaxation of active Jihad reflects the transition of the nation from a warlike to a civilized stage.38 MEDIEVAL DEVELOPMENTS OF JIHAD As Abbasid power declined, the rule of Muslim territory passed into the hands of Muslim usurpers and adventurers. Some of these rulers were men of questionable morals vis-a-vis Sharia. This raised the issue of the right to revolt against a Muslim ruler. Muslim schol- arship came up with a juristic interpretation for the situation. Several distinguished scholars provided the basis for accepting the rule of an evil Muslim ruler or tyrant on the ground that order is better than 38. M. KHADDURI, supra note 14, at 64-66. 392 [Vol. 3</page><page sequence="13">JIHAD chaos.39 This principle gave support to many non-Islamic regimes down through history. However, this principle was again challenged and revised in the fourteenth century by Ibn-Taymiya, a preeminent jurist. During Ibn-Taymia's period two major Muslim powers, the Mamluks and Mongols, were at war with each other.40 Ibn Taymia lived under the Mamluks. The issue facing Islamic scholars was the right to revolt against Muslim rulers, specifically the Mongols. If this right were established, a call for Jihad could be issued by Mamluks to encourage Muslim warriors to join the army to oppose the Mongols. Ibn-Taymia's supplied the answer. He held that the prohibition against revolt applies if two conditions are met: 1) the ruler is Muslim and 2) he applies Sharia. Since the Mongols did not apply Sharia they did not meet both conditions. He ruled, therefore, that Jihad against the Mongols is legitimate. Thus, from the fourteenth century Jihad came to include the right to revolt against a Muslim ruler if he violates Sharia. The sixteenth century was another major period of Muslim power exemplified by three major empires: the Ottomans, the Safavids, and the Moghals. In the beginning of the eighteenth cen- tury, however, the picture changed with European colonialism posing a new threat. One after another of the Muslim areas came under the political control of advancing European armies. Religious scholars suddenly found themselves faced by two simultaneous challenges. One was the threat of non-Muslim political control and the other, religious decay within the society. Both these challenges were met by leading figures.41 Mohammad Abdul Wahab, who was influenced by Ibn Taymia, used his learning to purify and radicalize Islamic theol- ogy and helped establish a Muslim state in Arabia under the predeces- sor of the ruling Saudi family. Abdul Wahab inspired the Mahdi in the Sudan, who launched a movement to purify the faith and throw off British political control, succeeded in his efforts at religious reform and political liberation from the British. Sanussi organized the Mus- lims of North Africa against colonial forces and sought internal puri- fication, and Abdul Qadir played the same role in Algeria.

The foremost figure to influence Muslims in this effort was the thinker,scholar, and revolu- tionary, Jamaluddin Afghani.43 He was a man with boundless energy and exalted spiritual commitment to the glory of Islam and Muslims. During his stay in Egypt, where he became quite influential, he gained as a disciple the distinguished scholar Mohammad Abduh (the men- tor of Rashid Rida, another distinguished scholar and thinker). JIHAD REINTERPRETED By the turn of the twentieth century another group of Muslim intellectuals appeared on the scene. Chief among them was Sir Mo- hammad Iqbal followed by Hassan-al-Banna, Maududi and Syed Qutb. Each one of them confronted the internal and external decline of Muslim society and also the loss of Muslim lands to foreign occu- pation. Their responses to the crisis required a reinterpretation of the Sharia and the doctrine of Jihad. The lead to redefine Jihad has been taken by Syed Abul Ala Maududi, originally from India who moved to what is now Pakistan. He was a prolific and profound scholar and has received universal recognition for his authoritative writings. Another notable figure of international stature and scholarship is Syed Abul Hassan Ali Nadvi-Rector of Nadvat-'ul-Uluma (Islamic University) Lucknow. In their writings they set forth the thesis that present day Muslim societies, despite being ruled by Muslim rulers, are going through a new Jahilya (dark age).44 Maududi's view of an Islamic state is the dogma behind the present day view of Jihad within the Muslim soci- ety. According to him: The difference between Islamic democracy and Western de- mocracy is, of course, the following: While the latter is based on the concept of the sovereignty of the people, the former is based on the principle of Caliphate (leadership) by the people. In Western 42. E. MORTIMER, FAITH &amp; POWER: THE POLITICS OF ISLAM 64-68 (1982); B. MET- CALF, ISLAMIC REVIVAL IN BRITISH INDIA, 1860-1900 (1982).

In one system the government carries out the will of the people; in the other, the government and people together must translate God's intentions into deeds. In short, Western democracy is a kind of absolute au- thority that exerts its power freely and in an uncontrolled manner, whereas Islamic democracy is subject to the divine law and exerts its authority in harmony with the commands of God and within the framework established by God.45 It is the divine law or Sharia which makes a Muslim society Is- lamic. Absence of the rules of Sharia in Muslim societies, according to Maududi, relegates these societies to the status of pre-Islamic pa- gan polytheistic Mecca-a period described as Jahiliya (dark ages); the backdrop against which Prophet Muhammad launched the divine mission. Hence, the present day context is a New Jahiliya. As the Prophet pursued his Jihad against Jahilya, the Muslims believe they have an obligation to do the same wherever they are faced with the New Jahilya. Syed Qutb, another outstanding scholar and the heir of Hassan-al-Banna as the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, adopted Maududi's interpretation. Through the network of Islamic scholars the idea is dominant in Muslim minds throughout the world.46 Thus, Ibn Taymia's revolt against Muslim rulers in Muslim societies continues with an intellectual power supplied by a new breed of major Muslim thinkers from different Muslim lands. Maududi's thesis received further support with the success of Shiite Islam under the leadership of Ayatullah Ruhullah Khomaini, a truly outstanding Islamic scholar and powerful political leader.47 CONCLUSION The Jihad within Muslim countries has taken the form of polit- ical housecleaning through the elimination of the rule of those consid- 45.

The fall of the Shah of Iran, the assassination of Sadat, and the overthrow of Jafar Neumairi are con- sidered the contemporary examples of this form of Jihad. Jihad, as war against foreign occupiers of Muslim lands is nothing new to Is- lam. The last major Jihad against a colonial power was the Algerian War of Independence against France which ended in the birth of the Republic of Algeria in 1962-a war that cost Algerians a million lives. And it is the doctrine of Jihad that now supports the Moro rebellion in the southern Phillipines, the Afghan struggle of indepen- dence against Soviet occupation, and the Palestinian and Lebanese liberation movements against Israeli occupation. These two forms of Muslim struggle; i.e. Jihad applied internally against unacceptable leaders and externally against non-Muslim rulers is often described by Westerners as Islamic fundamentalism. (This is an unfortunate cate- gory insofar as it allows Westerners to dismiss the intellectual and theological depth and meaning of Jihad). Internal Jihad i.e. the internal "political housecleaning" is a cru- cial form of Jihad for Muslims. Its goal is to develop a representative political order through an elective process that would replace rule by monarchy or military. It seeks to create a participatory democratic order which would incorporate Sharia principles. (It wishes to do this in a similar manner as has been done with the principles of the United States Constitution.) The image of Sharia expressed by the punishment of criminals in the public square has very little to do with that body of law which has played a major role in human civilization. Rather, Sharia must be seen as a body of law from which a people determines how to govern the fullness of their lives. The disillusion- ment of Muslim societies in incorporating and practicing Western ideas is great. It is believed by many scholars, however, that once such societies have constituted their own social and political systems on the principle of Sharia, they will be able to incorporate acceptable ideas from the West. This would mean grass roots cross-fertilization, the result of authentic interaction. And it would avoid the problem that has plagued so many Muslim nations-the attempt to impose foreign ideas from the top in the interest of political control. Islam is not a culture. It is a culture producing force. It pro- vides spirituality to any society or culture by implanting the Sharia into the culture.48 Islam is a powerful spiritual force that governs the 48. D.
