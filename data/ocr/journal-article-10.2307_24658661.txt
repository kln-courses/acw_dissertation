<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nietzsche's Study of Greek Rhetoric ERNST BEHLER University of Washington When Nietzsche assumed his professorship of classical philology at the University of Basel in 1869, his lectures were not only devoted to the literature, philosophy, and history of the Greeks, as we might expect, but also comprised courses on the formal components of classical learning such as grammar, meter, rhythm, and rhetoric.1 It might be that Nietzsche did not deal with these latter subjects out of a personal interest but because of teaching obligations connected with his appointment. Nevertheless, these lectures did constitute a large part of his teaching activities at the University, which were supplemented by regular teaching at the Paedagogium from 1869 to 1876.2 This was the high school (Gymnasium) in Basel, which at that time had a strong classical ("humanist") orientation. Nietzsche's task was to prepare the pupils of the upper classes for the university, not necessarily for the study of classical philology alone. Scholars who have dealt with Nietzsche's notes for these courses, testify to their relevance for an understanding of his later writings, yet this part of his work has never generated much interest in traditional Nietzsche scholarship and has also been neglected to a great extent by his editors.3 This attitude changed in the seventies, when Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Paul de Man took a new approach to these lectures and, out of a deconstructive interest in Nietzsche's view of language, focused on his courses on rhetoric.4 Lacoue-Labarthe accorded these lectures a crucial position among Nietzsche's writings and speaks of the landslide effect they exerted on his efforts to construe a unified</page><page sequence="2">4 ERNST BEHLER philosophical work—an effect of "desceuvrement" (D, 58). From now on, the real Nietzsche, the writer of aphorisms and the absolute sceptic with regard to last principles, begins to emerge. What he had done before, the production of The Birth of Tragedy, for instance, has the character of a mythologizing that can now no longer be justified. Simi larly, Paul de Man sees the key to Nietzsche's critique of metaphysics in his early studies of rhetoric. This critique is not merely a reversal of Plato, as Heidegger had claimed, but "lies in the rhetorical model of the trope or, if one prefers to call it that way, in literature as the language most explicitly grounded in rhetoric" (A, 109). Philosophy thereby reveals itself as an "endless reflection on its own destruction at the hands of literature" (A, 115). Or, to phrase this in even more de Manian terms, the self-consummation of philosophy comprised in this infinite reflection upon itself is endlessly postponed: "[T]his self destruction is infinitely displaced in a series of successive rhetorical reversals which by the endless repetition of the same figure, keep it suspended between truth and the death of this truth" (ibid.). The main difference between these two Nietzsche interpreters is that Lacoue Labarthe sees the effect of disceuvrement as being brought upon philos ophy from the outside, through Nietzsche's study of rhetoric, whereas de Man considers the working of deconstruction already operative in The Birth of Tragedy itself, but then, of course, enormously intensified by Nietzsche's theory of tropes. Nietzsche's occupation with rhetoric and language was of only short duration and meteoric character, but these investigations have put the issues of rhetoric and language firmly onto the agenda of Nietzsche research. Even the arch-conservative Nietzsche-Studien eventually made room for some profound studies of this subject.5 The main hindrance for such investigations is the lack of reliable editions of Nietzsche's lecture notes, particularly his lectures on classical rhetoric. The Colli-Montinari edition has not yet progressed far enough, and the earlier edition by Otto Crusius is not satisfactory.6 Crusius gives erroneous dates for these lectures and publishes only parts of them, deciding unilaterally that only the first seven paragraphs are worth editing and leaving out paragraphs 8-16 as well as the concluding "Outline of the History of Eloquence." His annotations are limited to less than one page7 and do not deal with the sources of these lectures, voluminous handbooks on rhetoric and language theory by Richard Volkmann, Gustav Gerber, Leonhard Spengel, and Friedrich Blass.8 Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy provide information on all questions related to these lectures in their French translation, but their textual basis is the incomplete Crusius edition.9 This also applies to Carole Blair's English</page><page sequence="3">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 5 translation of 1983.10 In 1989, Sander Gilman, in collaboration with Carole Blair and David J. Parent, produced a bilingual (German/English) edition of the complete text of Nietzsche's lecture notes on rhetoric and established the German text from the original manuscripts held in the Nietzsche archives in Weimar.11 Although this edition has been criticized for lack of editorial rigor,12 it undeniably has the merit of having provided the full scope of Nietzsche's lectures on rhetoric of 1872-73 for the first time. These lectures form the core of the following investigation.15 1. Nietzsche announced lecture courses on rhetoric for the winter se mester 1872-73 and the summer semester 1874.14 During the winter semester of 1872-73 he actually offered a course on rhetoric, but the one announced for summer 1874 had to be cancelled because of a lack of student participation. These lectures on rhetoric already belong to the period when Nietzsche's reputation as an academic teacher had been severely damaged in the wake of a hostile reception of The Birth of Tragedy in the profession. Indeed, the comment by Carl von Gersdorff on the cancellation of these lectures can only be interpreted in this way. Gersdorff knew from Nietzsche's letter of 1 April 1874 that his friend had "to prepare a lot for his summer lectures" on rhetoric, but that he did this with pleasure (KGB 3: 215).15 When he received news about the cancellation of this course, he wrote to Nietzsche on 29 May 1874: That again you have not managed to bring off a well prepared lecture course is indeed reason enough for some bitterness. However, who bears the guilt? Only those asses who cannot give up thistles and are content with their asinine character. (KGB II 4: 479-80) The previous course offered during winter semester 1872-73 also caused trouble with regard to student participation, but eventually materialized, if attended by only two students. One majored in German literature, the other in Law, and neither had classical philology as an academic field. In November 1872 Nietzsche wrote to Erwin Rohde: This is the next, somewhat oppressing fact that at our university the philologists16 have failed to appear for this winter semester:· a totally unique phenomenon that you will interpret as I do. In one particular case I even know that a student who intended to study philology here was held back in Bonn and happily wrote to his relatives that he thanked God for not being at a university where I am a teacher.— In short, Vehme has done its duty, but we are to act as if nothing</page><page sequence="4">6 ERNST BEHLER had happened. That this small university now has to suffer because of me is really hard to bear. We are 20 students below the enrollments of last semester. (KGB II 3: 85)17 On his own lectures on rhetoric, Nietzsche added the remark: With utmost difficulty I managed to bring about a course on the rhetoric of the Greeks and Romans attended by two students, that is, one in German and the other in Law. (ibid) We have two different sets of text for these two lecture courses: one with a more historical orientation toward the rhetoric of the Greeks and the Romans, and the other more of an exposition of classical rhetoric according to its concept, division into branches, relationship to language, tropical expression, figures of speech, and so on. Otto Ribbeck therefore decided that the historically oriented one was announced as the first and actually offered during winter semester 1872-73, whereas the other of a more expository nature was announced for summer semester 1874. He entitled the first History of Greek Eloquence,18 the second, Rhetoric,19 attaching the date of winter semester 1872-73 to the first and summer semester 1874 to the second, and published them in this sequence in volume 18 of Nietzsche's Werke. This decision now proves to have been wrong. The Exposition of Classical Rhetoric [Darstellung der antiken Rhetorik] considered by Ribbeck as the later text, shows borrowings from Gustav Gerber's Language as Art, a book Nietzsche consulted, when he prepared this course, and checked out from the Municipal Library in Basel during winter semester 1872-73.20 Gerber was the main source for Nietzsche's theory of tropes, which forms an essential part of these lectures21 and indeed constitutes the most important aspect of his text On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense, dictated in the summer of 1873 on the basis of his lectures on rhetoric.22 It would be inconceivable that he first wrote On Truth and Lie and then prepared his lectures on the Exposition of Classical Rhetoric. If this is the most important "inner" evidence for the chronological priority of the Exposition over the History, the "outer" evidence is even more compelling. One of the two students who attended the lectures during winter semester 1872—73, the law student, Louis Kelterborn, known under his literary name as Ludwig Wilhelm Kelterborn-Fischer (1853-1910), gave an account of these lectures and clearly identified them as the Exposition of Classical Rhetoric, including a listing of its sixteen paragraphs and the Appendix: "Outline of the History of Eloquence."23 Kelterborn also provides us with interesting information about the content of the lectures and how they were conducted. As a "citizen of Basel," he feels ashamed "that such an important faculty member found only two students." Nietzsche, "whose health was already precarious,"</page><page sequence="5">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 7 therefore offered the lectures on three evenings each week "in his familiarly elegant home," where the two participants "listened to him by lamplight and noted down the bon mots he dictated from his soft red leather notebook." He also offered them a "Culmbacher," one of the most exquisite beers in the world, "which he would drink out of a silver cup." Kelterborn took down notes covering "eighty-four cramped quarto pages" and thinks that this alone could convey an impression of the "rich content of the lectures." From the first introductory sec tion, he reproduces statements such as: Classical education culminated in the ability to speak well.—The Hellene attempted to turn all the occupations of life, even necessity and danger, into a game.—He does not strictly separate truth and falsehood, is more talented in writing poetry and fiction, desires more to be persuaded than educated, and covers the necessity to speak with artistic drapery.—The Roman is more natural, dry, crude, but in him, the worth of individual personality remains more in the foreground.24 This reversal in the chronological order of the two courses has an important effect on the understanding of Nietzsche's engagement with classical rhetoric. His theory of tropes and view of the relationship between rhetoric and language, the main themes of the Exposition, thereby move closer to the appearance of The Birth of Tragedy and give his theory of rhetoric the character of a counterposition to the theory of tragedy developed in this book. This is indeed the position of Lacoue Labarthe regarding these texts. He and Nancy also provided the most cogent arguments for the earlier dating of the Exposition, including a reference to Kelterborn.25 According to Lacoue-Labarthe, Nietzsche's The Birth of Tragedy expressed a metaphysical theory of absolute representation, since the human mind is capable of representing and expressing the Primordial One, the ground of all beings, in an immediate, i.e., unmediated, manner. This is possible, however, not through language, but art, more precisely, through music. In the sixteenth section of this text, Nietzsche quotes the famous passage in Schopenhauer's World as Will and Representation according to which music differs from all the other arts "because unlike them, it is not a copy of the phenomenon, but an immediate copy of the will itself, and therefore complements everything physical in the world and every phenomenon by representing what is metaphysical, the thing in itself" (KSA I: 104).26 Dionysian art, Nietzsche had maintained in The Birth of Tragedy, is always capable of articulating nature in its "true voice," its "undissimulated voice." The effect of rhetoric on Nietzsche's early theory consists, for Lacoue-Labarthe, in the fact that the privileging of art as a shortcut to</page><page sequence="6">8 ERNST BEHLER the absolute can no longer be maintained. This entire metaphysical edifice of "Artisten-Metaphysik,27 collapsed once Nietzsche began his study of rhetoric. Lacoue-Labarthe writes: The reason for this is very simple: since the beginning of its appear ance, rhetoric is eager to expel music and take its place. [Rhetoric] destroys, at least partly, that which was not properly linguistic in language and had nevertheless permitted its "rescue": its originally musical nature and its sounding essence, in other words, that which during speaking and through intonation preserves the original strength and provides expression. (D, 67) With this realization, the process of "un-working," of "desceuvremenf (D, 58), of deconstruction with regard to The Birth of Tragedy, is set in motion that eventually results in the complete undoing of Nietzsche's early metaphysical assumptions. Lacoue-Labarthe is indeed of the opinion that, from now on, no point of reference prior to language and rhet oric could be maintained, neither music as an original language nor the "musical drama" of Greek tragedy as a prototype of art. Every as sumed origin proves to be not originary, and representation always precedes presence. Now everything becomes language, and this new thinking about language first of all affects the notion of art (D, 72). A sharp dividing line is drawn between the Nietzsche of The Birth of Tragedy and the Nietzsche of The Exposition of Rhetoric (D, 74), creating a cleft between the two so deep that with respect to language, expression, and art, one side affirms what the other denies. The importance of Nietzsche's study of rhetoric could hardly be emphasized more, but the question arises whether rhetoric actually had the effect of a complete turnabout. A thorough reading of The Birth of Tragedy and the unpublished texts surrounding this book shows that the early metaphysical theory of art as an immediate expression of the absolute begins to dissolve of its own accord,28 long before Nietzsche's discovery of rhetoric, and transforms itself into that nonrepresentative rhetorical conception of art and language that is certainly supported by the study of Greek rhetoric, but not limited to these lectures. Nietzsche's Basel lectures on "The Greek Music Drama" (1870) and "Socrates and Tragedy" (1870), delivered at the Paedagogium for the general public and preceding The Birth of Tragedy, offer a perfect insight into this problem, which is basically one of language in its relationship to art (KSA I: 515-50).29 The lecture on "Socrates and Tragedy" identifies for the first time the pernicious influence Socrates had on the development of Greek</page><page sequence="7">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 9 Tragedy,30 but Nietzsche reveals a much more sympathetic attitude towards Socrates and Euripides here than in his book. In The Birth of Tragedy this influence derives from reason, intellectualization, "dialec tics," and manifests itself in "theoretical optimism," according to which "thought, using the thread of causality, can penetrate the deepest abyss of being" and "is capable not only of knowing being but even of correcting it" (BT, 95-96). This theoretical optimism suspends the sense for the truly tragic and classical and dares "to negate that Greek genius which as Homer, Pindar, and Aeschylus, as Phidias, as Pericles, as Pythia and Dionysus, as the deepest abyss and the highest height, is sure of our astonished veneration" (BT, 88). On the basis of this new "Socratism," Euripides reorganized the classical musical drama and created an "aesthetic Socratism" that could be stated as: "To be beautiful everything must be intelligible" (BT, 83-84). Following this principle, Euripides modified all the separate elements of drama—"language, characters, dramaturgic structure, and choric music" (BT, 84). Most importantly, he eliminated the Dionysian element and attempted "to reconstruct tragedy purely on the basis of an un-Dionysian art, morality, and world view" (BT, 81). Yet Euripides was only a "mask," only the representative of a demonic power speaking through him: "The deity that spoke through him was neither Dionysus nor Apollo, but an altogether newborn demon, called Socrates" (BT, 82). Socrates was that "second spectator" standing behind Euripides, in alliance with whom Euripides dared to become "the herald of a new art" (BT, 86). In the earlier text on "Socrates and Tragedy," however, Euripides appears in a more human, even comic guise, without the demonized features of a rationalist of the later writings. Nietzsche's tolerance here is probably a result of his frequent references to Aristophanes, who lends his conceptualization greater historical directness and proximity to classical Greece. What is more important to the present investigation, however, is that in this earlier text he presents the "death of tragedy" more as a tragic and inevitable event. The Birth of Tragedy maintains this feature of inevitability in the image of the shadow of Socrates spreading over posterity "down to the present moment and even into all future time"—"a shadow that keeps growing in the evening sun" (BT, 93). Yet the earlier text relates this inevitability of Socratism more to previous Greek history. In this context Nietzsche emphasizes the enormous distance between the "old musical drama," that is, Aeschylean tragedy, and the Athenian public of the fifth century sitting on the benches as spectators. What was for Nietzsche "the highest and most difficult for the poet," obviously the tragic pathos and musical passion in the lyrical scenes, was perceived by the masses as something of no</page><page sequence="8">10 ERNST BEHLER concern to them, whereas many accidental events in the plot, the "back ground history," interested them much more and seized them "with a sudden effect" (KSA 1: 537). The principle that "everything has to be understandable in order to be understood" was therefore not invented by Socrates or Euripides and pasted onto the old tragedy, but resulted from a deeper, more general, and also more inevitable process: that of history, the historical distancing of the Athenian public from the classical form of tragedy (ibid.). This early text reveals Nietzsche's assumption not only that Socratism is older than Socrates but also that Socratism is an intrinsic element in the development of literature and poetry, an element inherent in literature itself, not alien and implanted from outside. The "element of dialectics," the pernicious, "disastrous" component of tragedy for Nietzsche, took its point of departure from dialogue, which was originally absent in tragedy, and led to "argument," "context," and "dispute" (KSA 1: 545)—to rhetoric. Signs of this "decay" thus began to appear "long before Euripides." Nietzsche had the "courage" in this early text to point out "that even the most beautiful figures of Sophoclean tragedy— an Antigone, an Electra, an Oedipus—engage at times in barely tolerable trains of thought, that the dramatic characters are altogether more beautiful and magnificent than their articulation in words" (KSA 1: 548) .31 Only Aeschylus would then remain as the true "flowering" and "summit" of "Greek musical drama," since its decay, brought about "with tempest-like speed" by Euripides, begins already with Sophocles. Yet the processes at work here cannot be designated by historical figures, but result from more fundamental forces. Nietzsche's friend Heinrich Romundt expressed this idea aptly. He considered it "exemplary" how Nietzsche "proceeded from Euripides, investigated and presented his manner without any imposing tendency, then transformed the concept of Euripidism into that of Socratism, and finally established Socratism as pre-Socratic and post-Socratic, as an eternal disease" (KGB II 2: 176). 3. To be sure, Socratism is not rhetoric, and its impact on the old Athe nian musical drama, as well as on ancient Greek classicism as a whole, is seen with deep regret and nostalgia by Nietzsche. In another series of arguments in his early writings, he deals with language and art, not in terms of history, but in the sense of a structural, systematic relationship. These reflections concern the primordial character of music with regard not only to all other arts but also to language—a primacy essential to the thrust of The Birth of Tragedy and the particular character of this</page><page sequence="9">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 11 text. According to Nietzsche's early theory of language, there is a certain hierarchy among the various modes of language, the criterion for which is their instinctual, "natural" character. Written language is artificial and dead. Spoken language is resounding, resonating, has intervals, rhythms, and tempi. The highest level of feeling cannot be expressed in words, however, because every word merely signifies. Here the realm of music begins as the sphere of absolute expression. Words are the "surface of the agitated sea, whereas in its depths it storms" (KSA 7: 47-48). This is also the argument of a long fragment of spring 1871 On the Relationship of Language to Music (KSA 7: 359-69), in which Nietzsche becomes increasingly conscious of his own axiomatics. Music, according to his assumption, is a "language capable of infinite elucidation," whereas our language has to rely on concepts, on the "medium of thought" (KSA 7: 47). In music, the rule of instinct is "overwhelming," transcending the "limit of comprehension and incomprehension" (KSA 7: 49). Nietzsche repeatedly points out the "infinitely deficient symbolism" of language in comparison to music (KSA 7: 63) and, in this context, refers to the "impossible enterprise of composing music for a poem" (KSA 7: 185). The aforementioned fragment of spring 1871 On the Relationship of Language to Music focuses on this latter point and shows how Nietzsche is driven into precarious positions and most extravagant assertions to maintain his opinion. Following his typical way of thinking of that time, he first states that in comparison to the "eternal significance of music," language is merely a "simile," belonging like mimicry to the "human symbolism of gesture" and thereby falling into the "category of a corporeal symbolism." Music, in contrast, is the "generally imageless language of the heart" (KSA 7: 359). To attempt to illustrate a poem through music and provide a conceptual language for music appears to be absurd. He writes: "[WJhat a crazy world! An enterprise that appears as if a son were seeking to engender his father!" (KSA 7: 362). There is no possible transition from the world of language (representations, concepts) to the world of music, since these two worlds are as distinct as the realms of the Apollinian and the Dionysian. How could "an image, a concept, an appearance be given the power to engender the sound by itself" (KSA 7: 363). At the pinnacle of music, e.g., in "Beethoven's latest quartets," which "put all visual quality and the entire realm of empirical validity to shame," every kind of "imagery" appears as crudeness, as an "oifensive superficiality" (KSA 7: 365). If there is a transition from music to word as in song, ancient lyric poetry, or the fourth passage of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, the goal is not one of "adequate correspondence," as though music aimed for an</page><page sequence="10">12 ERNST BEHLER expression in words, but: "[A] musical impulse from a completely differ ent sphere chooses that particular text as a metaphorical expression of itself" (KSA 7: 366). To prove this assumption, Nietzsche ventures the opinion that it would be insignificant to be able to understand the text of vocal music. Schiller's poem "To Joy" is "entirely incongruent" with the "dithyram bic jubilation of world-redemption" in Beethoven's music and a "pale moonlight overwhelmed by that sea of flames" (KSA 7: 366). The lyrics of the great classical poets could not possibly be comprehensible to the listening mass of people preoccupied by their own images and thoughts. And those who participate in singing a song do this "unconcerned as to whether or not the word is comprehensible to someone who does not participate in this singing" (ibid.). To maintain his Schopenhauerianism and Wagnerianism, Nietzsche engages in risky speculations, but when he approaches the even more difficult problem of the relationship of language to music in opera, he simply breaks off without ever again returning to this topic (KSA 7: 369). His discourse on music in its relationship to language is never renounced or over come, but simply peters out. He also must have realized that while music should be more spontaneous, instinctive, unconscious, and natural than all other forms of artistic expression, only the most artistic, learned, and sophisticated forms of music (e.g., Beethoven and Wagner) satisfy his expectations and correspond to his critical standards. These difficulties are not noticeable in The Birth of Tragedy, since Nietzsche covered them up through his manner of writing and by quoting from Schopenhauer. The unpublished fragments, however, exhibit the impasse his early theory reaches in unmistakable terms. After the long fragment of spring 1871 on the relationship of language to music, the unpublished fragments have no further entry on this topic. In the notebook of spring-autumn 1871, Nietzsche still mentions the exceptional status of music among the arts and writes, in one instance: "In all the arts we are critics; here in music we still are complete, living human beings," or in another: "Only in music are we not yet scientific-historical human beings" (KSA 7: 372). The Birth of Tragedy appeared early in 1872, and from then on his discourse changes, articulating these aesthetic problems in terms of an opposition between art and philosophy. These two poles are on a par, however, since true philosophy, as exemplified by the Pre-Socratic philosophers, has an originally artistic thrust. Yet both art and philosophy are incapable of reaching the true essence of things and remain on the surface within the realm of anthropomorphism, appearance, language, and images. A few examples will have to suffice to depict this train of thought.</page><page sequence="11">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 13 Obviously referring to the Greeks, Nietzsche characterizes the time when myth disappears as a time of "great danger," a time "when the wheel begins to turn ever faster." In this moment the philosopher appears, and philosophy and art "take the place of the disappearing myth" (KSA 7: 421). The philosopher has to recognize what is needed, and the artist has to create it (KSA 7: 423). This interdependence and interaction of philosophy and art manifests itself in a great variety of ways and also applies to the aesthetic character of a philosophical system. Nietzsche writes: "The beauty and magnificence of a world construction (alias philosophy) now decides about its value—that is, we pass judgment on it as a work of art" (KSA 7: 434). The artistic character is now seen, however, as illusory, as based on illusions. He claims: "The sentence has to be established—we only live by illusions—our consciousness glides over the surface. Much is hidden from our glance" (ibid.). Shortly thereafter, the same sentence is established in slightly different fashion and with a definite direction towards art: "Indeed, because of the superficiality of our intellect, we live in a constant illusion, that is, in order to live we need art in every moment" (KSA 7: 435). In more compact manner, Nietzsche writes: "Absolute knowledge leads to pessimism·, art is the remedy" (KSA 7: 436). Yet art is the remedy precisely because of its illusory character: "Art is based on the inaccuracy of seeing. Also inaccuracy of the ear with regard to rhythm, tempo,32 etc., art again based on this" (KSA 7: 440). The following note reminds us that Nietzsche still develops these thoughts in the context of the ancient Greeks: "In contrast [to the Socratic schools], the older philosophers are partly guided by a drive similar to the one that created tragedy" (KSA 7: 442). To illustrate this aesthetic, artistic ingredient in the "older" philosophy, Nietzsche writes: "Thales long past—yet an artist standing at a waterfall will admit that he is right" (ASA 7: 441). Or he says: "What is the philosopher? To be answered by the old Greeks" (KSA 7: 448). All the quotes in the previous paragraph are taken from the crucial notebook of "Summer 1872—Beginning of 1873." Later in this notebook Nietzsche expresses his growing scepticism in more general terms, but without departing completely from the ancient Greeks. In one instance we read: "The process of all religion and philosophy and science with regard to the world: it begins with the grossest anthropomorphism and does not cease to refine itself. The individual human being even considers the system of the stars as serving him or being in relation to him" (KSA 7: 456). Anthropomorphism seems to be the key word in these reflections: "The human being knows the world to the degree to which he knows himself, that is, its depth unveils for him the degree to which he is astonished by himself and his complicated nature" (KSA</page><page sequence="12">14 ERNST BEHLER 7: 458). The result of these considerations is obvious: "We can prove neither the metaphysical nor the ethical nor the aesthetic meaning of existence" (KSA 7: 459). As far as art is concerned, Nietzsche comes to the conclusion: "Absolute scepticism: necessity of art and illusion" (KSA 7: 458). He obviously enters the state of "moralistic scepticism and dissolution" later described in the retrospective "Preface to the Sec ond Volume" of Human, All Too Human (KSA 2: 370). In this state he ceased to believe '"in anything anymore,' as the people say; also not in Schopenhauer." He adds: "it was precisely at this time that a writ ing, kept secret, originated, 'On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense'" (ibid.). Several notes, still in the same notebook, indicate this direction of thought. Nietzsche writes in one of these: "Philosophy to be regarded like astrology: namely, to link the fate of the world with that of the human being: that is, to consider the highest evolution of the human being as the highest evolution of the world" (KSA 7: 466). This is precisely what he terms "dream idealism" (KSA 7: 467). Truth is a "social need," only with society does the "need for truthfulness" begin, does the belief in truth become necessary for the human being (KSA 7: 473). This seems to anticipate the idea of a social contract about truth, an essential argument of On Truth and Lie (KSA 1: 877). Since "nature" has "em bedded" the human being "in nothing but illusions," the question arises as to how an "inclination to truth" could have developed (£SA 7: 474). It is at this point, in trying to answer this question, that Nietzsche first uses a rhetorical vocabulary and arguments taken directly from Gustav Gerber's Language as Art. He considers the relation of the "metaphor" for the development of truthfulness (ibid.), determines the formation of concepts as a "quick subsuming of similarities" (KSA 7: 475), de fines "metonymies" as "exchanges of cause and effect" (KSA 7: 481), argues that "tropes" are the outcome of our sensory perceptions (KSA 7: 487), and comes to the result: "All rhetorical figures (that is, the es sence of language) are logical fallacies·, with that, reason begins" (KSA 7: 486). His new objective is condensed in the statement: "I would like to treat the question concerning the value of knowledge like an indifferent angel seeing through the whole treachery. Without being angry, but without heart" (KSA 7: 493). Rhetoric does not appear in this thought process as the force destroying the early metaphysical discourse, but as a new accomplice in the critique of metaphysics providing additional argumentation.</page><page sequence="13">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 15 4. The lectures on Ancient Rhetoric of 1872-73 clearly correspond to this state of Nietzsche's intellectual development. In their entirety, they provide an oudine for the systematic structure of the discipline of rhetoric as it had become established among the ancients. While Nietzsche refers to ancient rhetoricians or theoreticians of that discipline, such as Anaximenes, Aristotle, Quintilian, Cicero, etc., it is not his goal to deal with the historical development of rhetoric among the ancients. This is done in the brief appendix to these lectures entitled "Outline of the History of Eloquence"33 and the lecture course on The Rhetoric of the Greeks and the Romans planned for the summer semester of 1874, which did not, however, materialize. In his earlier lectures, Nietzsche aims at an exposition of the system of classical rhetoric including its various subdivisions and follows handbooks on this subject provided by Volkmann, Spengel, and Blass.34 The most original part of these lectures is §3 dealing with the "Relation of the Rhetorical to Language," a topic not germane to ancient rhetoric, but revealing a modern perspective of "language critique." Here again, Nietzsche is not entirely original, since to a great extent he follows Gustav Gerber's Language as Art, which supplies him with the views of the most important theoreticians of language since Herder as well as Gerber's own theory of tropes. As has been noted by Glenn Most and Thomas Fries, however, Nietzsche handles this material in an independent manner and is on his own terrain when he writes a sentence like: "language is rhetoric:" (RL, 23).35 He begins this paragraph with a reflection on the slightly pejorative meaning the notions of rhetoric and rhetorical have assumed in the modern age. The modern meaning of rhetoric suggests an attitude that is "not natural," but artificial (RL, 21). Nietzsche could have referred here to Kant, who described this pejorative understanding of rhetoric in §53 of his Critique of Judgment where he says: Rhetoric, in so far as this means the art of persuasion, i.e., of deceiving by a beautiful show (ars oratorio), and not the mere elegance of speech (eloquence and style), is a dialectic which borrows from poetry only so much as is needful to win minds to the side of the orator before they have formed a judgment and to deprive them of their freedom; it cannot therefore be recommended either for the law courts or for the pulpit.36 He also could have referred to the romantic turn in literature which supposedly had brought about a sharp dividing line between the "merely rhetorical" and the "truly poetic."37 Nietzsche certainly has this modern</page><page sequence="14">16 ERNST BEHLER trend in mind when he assumes that to people of his time "all ancient literature, above all Roman literature," appeared to be "somewhat ar tificial and rhetorical" (RL, 21). The main reason for this impression is that, for Nietzsche, "the true prose of antiquity is an echo of public speech and is built upon its laws, whereas our prose has always to be explained more from writing, and our style presents itself as something to be perceived through reading." Reading and hearing require a "wholly different presentational form," and ancient literature therefore "appeals chiefly to the ear, in order to bribe it." The valorization implied in the modern view of true poetry and literature can therefore be turned around, in that ancient literature, in spite of its rhetorical character, is much more poetic, whereas the moderns "are much more pale and abstract." (ibid.). Nietzsche then goes one step further, claiming that what one calls "'rhetorical' as a means of a conscious art" is really only a develop ment "guided by the clear light of the understanding of the artistic means which are already found in language." There is no use in appealing to an "unrhetorical 'naturalness' of language" because "language itself is the result of nothing but rhetorical arts." Aristode had called rhetoric that power which discovers and exhibits what is effective and impressive in a thing. That, however, is already "the essence of language." Language, just like rhetoric, is not related "to the true, the essence of things." Language does not intend to instruct, "but to convey to others a subjective impulse and its acceptance." The one who forms language "does not perceive things or events, but impulses." He does not render "sensations, but merely copies of sensations." A sensation, caused by a nerve stimulus, "does not take in the thing in itself," but presents it only "externally through an image." Yet, how can an "act of the soul" possibly "be presented through a sound image"? Nothing more is conveyed than an "image." Nietzsche says: "It is not things that pass over into consciousness, but the manner in which we relate to them, the πιθανόν [persuasive]. The full essence of things will never be grasped." (RL, 23). Instead of a thing, we receive only a sign. Up to here, Nietzsche had made free use of Gerber's Language as Art.58 The following sentence, however, sounds like a concluding statement and is indeed his own: "That is the first aspect: language is rhetoric because it desires to convey only a δόξα [opinion], not έπιστήμη [knowledge]" (ibid.). The second aspect concerns the tropes, the "nonliteral significations," as Nietzsche designates them. All words are "in themselves and from the beginning" nothing but tropes, which follows immediately from the foregoing arguments. Words do not represent "that which truly takes place," but only a "sound image":</page><page sequence="15">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 17 "language never expresses something completely but displays only a characteristic that appears to be prominent" (RL, 23). In this way, we say "sail" instead of ship, "waves" instead of sea, δράκων (that which looks shiny) or serpens (that which creeps) for snake. This is the rhetorical figure of synechdoche (the understanding of one thing by another), which Nietzsche renders as "encompassing." The next tropical form is that of metaphor, which does not create new words, but gives a new meaning to existing ones. This is how we speak of the summit of mountains, of γλώσσα (tongue) as the mouthpiece of the flute, and of μαστός (breast) as a hill. Metaphorical practice is also operative in the designation of gender, since gender, in "the grammatical sense, is a luxury of language and a pure metaphor." Then there is the "transposition from place to time" as in the figure "at home," meaning experienced in something. The third tropical form is metonymy, a "substitution of cause for effect" (RL, 25). This form appears when we say "perspiration" for work, "tongue" for language, or call the drink "bitter," the stone "hard," and the leaf "green." Bitter, hard, and green are not objective qualities, but only subjective sensations, reactions on the part of the subject. This entire argument, including all the examples, is borrowed from Gerber.39 This section of §3 also concludes with a summarizing state ment that reads: In sum: the tropes are not just occasionally added to words but con stitute their most proper nature. It makes no sense to speak of a 'proper meaning,' transformed [made tropical] only in special cases. (RL, 25). Here, however, the concluding summary is also paraphrased from Gerber's Language as Art.40 Finally, there is just as little difference between "straightforward speech and rhetorical figures" as there is between words and tropes. In the last analysis, all that is called language is actually "figuration." Language is created by "individual speech artists," but then determined "by the fact that the taste of the many makes choices." Here again, we come across the idea of a social contract determining the actual character of a language. If individual language artists do not succeed with their creations, everyone appeals to common usage and calls their figures of speech "barbarism and solecism": "A figure that finds no buyer becomes an error" (ibid.). The "delight in the similarity of sound" is also an important factor in the rhetorical formation of language, although there will always be disagreement. Luther, for instance, condemned new words, such as "to take to heart" (beherzigen) and "profitable" (ersprießlich), but they "prevailed anyway." Simon Dach paved the way for "fearless" (furchtlos), and the term "sentimental" (empfindsam) made</page><page sequence="16">18 ERNST BEHLER its entry with Yorik's Sentimental Journey of 1794. The entire argument here, including examples, is taken over from Gerber.41 In spite of these heavy borrowings, one can discover a typically Nietzschean argumentation in this paragraph, an argumentation that is fully in line with the thought process exhibited in his unpublished fragments of that time and adding an important new component to it. This thought process had its key term in the notion of anthropomor phism.42 The notion of language exhibited in §3 of the lectures on Ancient Rhetoric conveys an anthropomorphic view of language, encloses us within an entirely human world of communication that cannot be transcended and verified by "objective" knowledge. The key sentence of this section seems to be the one that limits language to the function of conveying subjective reactions to others. Although this statement can be traced back to Gerber, from now on it will be a guiding principle in Nietzsche's own philosophical discourse. Yet one also notices a certain hesitation to transform and expand discoveries made on the restricted level of rhetoric to the entire realm of language. A sentence like: "What is usually called language is actually all figuration" ("Eigentlich ist alles Figuration, was man gewöhnlich Rede nennt") does not sound terribly convincing, since it conveys too many reservations ("eigentlich," "gewöhn lich"). There is a tension in this paragraph between the limited sphere of ancient rhetoric and the wide field of language in general, a tension not overcome until the writing of On Truth and Lie. There is no doubt, however, that Nietzsche's reflection on language, a major theme of his thought, had its starting point in these lectures on Ancient Rhetoric. 5. Although the other sections of these lectures on Ancient Rhetoric deal more specifically with ancient Greek and Roman rhetoric, they also convey important ideas of Nietzsche's own conception of style, writing, language, and communication. The reason for this is simply that he considers the ancient, especially the Greeks, as exemplary human beings. Everything he says about them assumes a challenging, summoning character and is meant to provoke the modern European. Even if Nietzsche is not entirely original in these sections and paraphrases manuals on ancient rhetoric a great deal, his particular relationship to the ancients makes these lectures appear nevertheless as a Nietzschean text and an important document for his understanding of these subject matters. This becomes obvious right at the beginning of the first paragraph, where he speaks about the "extraordinary development" of rhetoric among the ancients and sees one of the "specific differences</page><page sequence="17">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 19 between the ancients and moderns" in this trend. The moderns hold rhetoric in "some disrepute," as is evidenced in John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, where we can read: We must allow, that all the Art of Rhetoric ... all the artificial and figurative application of Words Eloquence has invented, are for nothing else but to insinuate wrong Ideas, move the Passions, and thereby mislead the Judgment; and so indeed are perfect cheats. (Bk. 3, chap. 10, sec. 34)43 To be sure, rhetoric originates in a people still living "in mythic images" and having "not yet experienced the unqualified need of historical accuracy," a people that wants to "rather be persuaded than instructed." Rhetoric is furthermore "an essentially republican art": "one must be accustomed to tolerating the most unusual opinions and points of view and even to taking a certain pleasure in their counterplay" (RL, 3). Yet the education of the ancient person culminated in rhetoric, and this is the "highest spiritual activity of the well-educated political man" (ibid.). In a more philosophical consideration, this tendency of Hellenistic life reveals to us an attitude in which "all matters of the intellect, of life's seriousness, of necessities, even of danger" are perceived "as play." Nietzsche illustrates this attitude with a quote from Kant's Critique of Judgment that he also found in Gerber. In the Kant quote given previously from §53 of the Critique of Judgment, rhetoric was put on a lower level than poetry because it only borrowed from poetry in order to seduce and persuade. In §51, Kant uses his famous notion of a "free play of the imagination" as a medium for comparison, which leads to a much more favorable result for rhetoric. Rhetoric is also exhibiting a free play of the imagination that puts it on a par with poetry, at least in this regard. Kant writes: The arts of speech are rhetoric and poetry. Rhetoric is the art of transacting a serious business of the understanding as if it were a free play of the imagination; poetry, that of conducting a free play of the imagination as if it were a serious business of the understanding. Thus the orator announces a serious business, and for the purpose of entertaining his audience, conducts it as if it were a mere play with ideas. The poet promises merely an entertaining play with ideas, and yet it has the same effect upon the understanding as if he had only intended to carry on its business.44 This attitude of play, transforming seriousness into play and play into seriousness, is the characteristic feature of Hellenistic life for Nietzsche, whereas the Romans appear more "dry and coarse" in this regard. Yet what adds color to the Roman style of rhetoric is "aristocratic dignity"</page><page sequence="18">20 ERNST BEHLER and "versatile juridical practice": "The awareness of individual dignity is Roman, not Greek" (RL, 5). Plato had, of course, "a strong dislike" of rhetoric. He labeled it as a "skill" and in Gorgias (463) subordinates it along with the arts of cooking and embellishment to κολακεία (flattery). Yet there are also vestiges of a more positive conception of rhetoric in Plato, especially in Phaedrus (239e ff.). The true art of speaking requires "a very profound and extensive education." The one who knows can be ρητορικός (rhetorical) as well as διδακτικός (didactic). This is obvious in Socrates, whom Plato depicts "as sometimes instructing academically, and at others, being rhetorical in a popular fashion" {RL, 7). Nietzsche finds the most impressive conception of rhetoric in Aristotle, for whom rhetoric is a δύναμις (power) to employ "all possible means of persuasion about a thing." In this capacity rhetoric is neither an έπιστήμη (knowledge) nor a τέχνη (skill), but something in its own right, a δύναμις (power) which can be developed to a τέχνη (skill). Rhetoric is not mere πείθειν (persuasion), but a κατά τό ένδεχόμενον πείθειν (a persuasion employing all available means): "The orator can defend a difficult cause, just like a physician who cares for an incurable patient." This is the opposite of the "Sicilian definition," the Platonic conception, of rhetoric {RL, 9). What Aristotle's conception of rhetoric lacks, however, is a sense of the performative: "Aristotle probably wishes delivery to be viewed not as essential, but only as something incidental." For him, the rhetorical is found in books, he is interested only in inventio, not in elocutio, dispositio, memoria, and pronuntiatio {elocutio). He is a formalist and treats rhetoric like drama when "he thinks the effect of drama to be independent of the performance, and thus does not take up the physical presence on stage in its definition" {RL, 11). What impresses Nietzsche most in the Stoic view of rhetoric is the εύ λέγειν (speaking well) which later became more comprehensively defined, as, for instance, in the five components of speech listed by Quintilian: inventio, dispositio, elocutio, memoria, pronuntiatio {RL, 13). Cicero zealously opposed the "customary trivial textbooks" and sketched in the person of his Crassus "the nobler picture of the philosophical orator." But he never comprehended "the opposition of the true philosopher and the orator," and in comparison to Aristotle, his book {De oratore) is "crude and distasteful" {RL, 15). Of particular interest for the present investigation is §7 of these lectures dealing with "The Tropical Expression" and complementing some of the issues already raised in §3. Here, as in the earlier paragraph, Nietzsche follows the subdivision of tropes into metaphor, synecdoche, and metonomy, but he virtually equates tropes ("nonliteral significations") with metaphors (figurative expressions) and speaks mostly of metaphors.</page><page sequence="19">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 21 Of particular interest is the origin of the metaphorical manner of speak ing, which according to Cicero was "engendered from necessity, found in the distress of poverty and embarrassment, but sought after for its grace." Cicero said: Just as clothing was invented first to protect against the cold, and afterward was used for the decorative and refinement of the body, the tropus originated from deficiency and became commonly used when it was pleasing. (RL, 51)45 In this context, Cicero compares metaphors to a borrowed treasure that we take from elsewhere because we do not possess it ourselves. Need (deficiency) and luxury, as the two main sources of metaphors, lead, as far as the creation of metaphors is concerned, to a chronolog ical scheme, which has implications for what is to be considered the "proper" meaning or the "original" meaning of words. Quintilian, for instance, regarded the proper meanings of words to be the plainer and less ornate ones,46 but Jean Paul established the correct relationship when he wrote in his Preschool for Aesthetics:. As hieroglyphs preceded letters in writing, in speech the metaphor, in so far as it signifies relationships and not objects, was the earlier word which slowly had to fade into denotative expression. The figurative animation and embodiment still coincided, because self and world were still fused. For this reason every language in its spiritual relationships is a dictionary of faded metaphors. (RL, 53)47 Since the ancients could conceive of art only as a conscious presenta tion, they attributed "inartistic metaphors" to the uneducated and derived the popular tropes "from embarrassment and stupidity, the rhetorical tropes from art and delight." But this is "an entirely false contrast" (RL, 53). Sometimes our language is "forced to use metaphors because synonyms are missing, and in other cases, it seems as if it employs luxury" (ibid.). What follows from all these observations is the sentence: "Language never expresses something completely, but only stresses the most outstanding characteristic" (RL, 57). 6. In the lecture course projected for the summer of 1874 on Rhetoric of the Greeks and Romans, Nietzsche states that the Greeks did not devote to any other task "such incessant labor as to eloquence." He considers devotion to rhetoric as "the most tenacious element of Greek culture," which is "contagious," as can be seen "from the Romans and the whole Hellenistic world." Christian preaching can be traced back to that element, as well as the "development of the entire modern prose style,"</page><page sequence="20">22 ERNST BEHLER although this style relates more directly to Cicero. The "ability to speak" (Reden-können) manifests Hellenic culture and power and "probably also spells their doom." He quotes Diodorus, who in the "Introduction" to his Bibliotheke said quite "naively": No one will easily be able to name a higher prerogative than oratory. For it is by virtue of oratory that the Greeks excel above other na tions and the educated person above the uneducated, moreover, it is by oratory alone that one individual acquires authority over many; but in general, everything appears only as the speaker's power rep resents it. {RL, 213) As Nietzsche comments, this "immoderate presumption" by orators and stylists of being able to do anything "runs through all antiquity in a manner incomprehensible to us": "They control 'opinion about things' and hence the effect of things upon men." The "precondition" for this power of rhetoric is, however, "that mankind itself was educated in rhetoric," a requirement that can be noticed in "classical" higher education "even today," "except that it is no longer oral speech, but its faded image, writing, that emerges as goal" {RL, 212). We should therefore not assume "that such an art falls from heaven: the Greeks worked at it more than any other people and more than at any other thing (i.e., also so many people!)." On the whole, the Greeks "feel that they are speakers, in contrast to the άγλωσσοι (non-speakers), the non-Greeks" {RL, 213). The lecture course of 1874 presents the manifold development of this art among the Greeks, which for Nietzsche had its apex in Demosthenes, who outdid even "the greatest genius of Athenian rhetoric," Aeschines {RL, 225). For Demosthenes "discovered the last stage of eloquence," delivery or elocution, to be the most important and "set it aglow with his passion, so that it still appeared natural" {RL, 227).48 Nietzsche includes Roman eloquence as a "powerful new force" {RL, 235) and pays special attention to the "favoring of Atticism in Rome" {RL, 236) leading to the "significant struggle between Asianism and Atticism" {RL, 235). He has a predilection for Dionysius of Halicarnassus among the latter rhetoricians (ibid.), but the "inestimable merit of having found the classical language of the Roman world culture" belongs to Cicero. His language is "not un-Roman, not Asian, not Attic, but also not ancient Roman or parochially Roman." It is an "enchanting mixture that cannot be explained by eclecticism alone, but only from a real ήθος [character], a whole spiritual predisposition where these various currents converged into one." Nietzsche adds: the genesis of the Ciceronian language is one of the mightiest cultural feasts; it was worthwhile for the artists—that is what he mainly was—</page><page sequence="21">NIETZSCHE'S STUDY OF GREEK RHETORIC 23 to use unspeakable industriousness and in the end to admire him self unspeakably: which Julius Caesar also did. He is one of the greatest rhythmists who ever lived; we must therefore forgive him a great deal. (RL, 235-36)49 With these lectures, the radius of Greek rhetoric seems to have re treated to the classical world for Nietzsche, and the broader ramifica tions of rhetoric into language theory and the metaphorical character of language seem to be replaced by a stricter adherence to his lecture topic, the history of Greek and Roman eloquence. The main relationship of ancient rhetoric to the intellectual culture of the moderns is oppositional and manifests itself in Nietzsche's repeated confrontations of the infinitely refined classical ability to speak and to listen with the predominantly written type of communication among the moderns. The moderns, in turn, are reproached for having lost the ability to understand an "unliterary education" and for "transposing their dispositions involuntarily into the past."50 As can easily be noticed, however, these confrontational gestures are deliberately provocative and meant to challenge the modern age in its complacency. In the unpublished fragments of the later part of 1874, Nietzsche asks why we should take style and representation so seriously and not be simply content with "clarity" (KSA 7: 830, 834). The answer is that so much would be lost if we adhered only to the "principle of clarity," since the human being, after all, is not limited to mere logic (KSA 7: 830). But the main argument for the full use of language is that this "magnifi cent tone edifice" (das herrliche Tonwesen) of Greek language was not born of "need" as the "mother of language," but of "joy and luxury." "A people that has six cases and conjugates its verbs in a hundred forms has a communal and exulting soul," and the people that cre ated such a language has "effused the fullness of its soul to all poster ity" (KSA 7: 832). Nietzsche responded to this challenge with his own style and was proud of the vocal, rhetorical dimension it exhibited. His study of Greek rhetoric certainly inspired his theory of language, but also resulted in the rhetorical character of his own writings. NOTES 1.
